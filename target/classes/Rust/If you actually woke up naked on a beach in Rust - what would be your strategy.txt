[[If you actually woke up naked on a beach in Rust - what would be your strategy]]





And if I die, I die for good?

I'm cheesing outpost
    Turning around and walking into the sea
        Looking for better respawn
    Cheese outpost and make nighttime stealth missions to bandit for precious pickles and tuna
        Can you explain what ‚Äúcheese outpost‚Äù means? Thanks
            Step 1: Run straight to Outpost. Stop for mushrooms/cloth as needed.
Step 2: Hit barrels with rock around the Outpost. Pray for paddle drop so you can use that instead
Step 3: recycle all that you find until you can buy enough cloth/leather for armor (gloves are what you use), and stone/wood for base. 
Step: Make base near Outpost. Rinse Repeat. 

Outpost let's you straight up buy mats. And if offers a t1 work bench so you can tech tree. Progression is a little slower than running monuments but it's way safer.
            ‚ÄúCheesing‚Äù something in a video game means just using some of the video game mechanics (sometimes tedious) to make sure you won‚Äôt lose no matter what. Like hitting the barrels in safe zone or outpost and never leaving would be ‚Äúcheesing‚Äù it. 
It‚Äôs another way of saying using a cheap tactic to win basically.
                Got it, thanks for the explanation.
        Those are also in outpost
            not on pure vanilla

    why specifically a brother?
        Brother üëÜ
        You are getting rocked, buddy.
            I‚Äôm not your buddy pal
                I'm not your pal friend
                    I‚Äôm not your friend, guy.
                        I'm not your guy, stranger
                            I'm not a stranger, fella.
1: Make food for all the hungry gamer guys who don‚Äôt know the difference between trees

2: become popular since no one has food

3: win
    Bro just explained mankind in 3 points.
        Somewhere along the 2nd and 3rd step the whole industrial revolution happened. And now we are here
            Where it all went wrong :(

Lemme go back to working 45-65 hour work weeks of looking for random shit to eat and store for winter, then dying at age 30 from a tiger
                A tiger? Nah man, more likely from a flu.
                If you are too dense to know that people lived to old age way back I don't know how to help you. You were more likely to die at birth or in childhood than adulthood, unless you went into combat. The child mortality rate is what brought down average life expectancy.
                    Sharing more info here. If you made it to 7, you were likely to make it to 70. Unless there's a war, famine or pestilence. So, the 4 horsemen.
                        war, famine, pestilence and children?
                    Unless you die via a tiger at age 30. You don‚Äôt ‚Äúgo into combat‚Äù you go out so you can find random crap in the forest so you can get the calories you need for the day. If you‚Äôre too dense to know that this really isn‚Äôt all that serious, I don‚Äôt know how to help you.
        I think it went more like this:

Discover bread

Mass produce bread

Tax grains so you can use it as government welfare i.e. cura annonae
    What do you mean difference between trees?
Pull the massive rock and torch out of my ass, bc that's gotta hurt.
I'd find the toughest guy in the toughest clan on the island and confidently walk right up to him and then drop to my knees and suck his cock so I can be his favorite bitch and he'll keep me safe
    Ahhh the Alfred Lickspittle play.
    Funny enough, that‚Äôs how you‚Äôd end up on the island in the first place.
    oh
WHATS UP SPOONERS
    WELCOME BACK

            Today we‚Äôre gonna be playing with lucky llama and blazed
                I fumbled the bag last time so here's hoping that doesn't happen again.
                    Looks like there‚Äôs some good vending machines so let‚Äôs go see if we can jack hammer them
                        I see a decayed base, maybe we will find some cheese
                            Money????? Awwww‚Ä¶ No money.
                                This probably isn‚Äôt the smart move but ah cmon. Sometime you gotta risk it for the loot.
                                    But first let‚Äôs ask chat GPT

THE FUCK IS THIS WOOD FOOT, BULLPUP, LONG AAHHH MAG, AI PICTURE!!!!!
    And the shadow ü§£
    I can‚Äôt stand this trend of farming engagement with an AI image.
    And he only has 4 fingers
There's no food in Outpost and it's a dump.  Fishing villages allow safe food, income and probably the safest opportunity to do something fun.
    Better view too
    Me eating raw fish to survive. Covered in shark guts with a stack of blue cards. "I will give you a blue card if you leave the safe zone and cook this fish for me. Please. I have been eating raw shark for weeks."
I would be having seizures before I wake up because my brain only has 8gb ram.
    Freeze every few steps cause my eyes can‚Äôt load textures fast enough
Wait for the wipe.
    Random naked sneaks up on you, wipes your ass. "Now what?"
        LMAOOOOO

Bruh if I had those awards I would have given you one

My neighbors probably think im a madman laughing now
F1 K..
98% of this player base would die, not from another human, but because they are not self reliant.
Depends if death is permanent, if yes I would run into the sea cuz in not living with that constant fear of getting sniped from across the map
innovative foot and gun design
    And the left hand. Can't lose your 5th finger if you never had one.
    A mag in the rear stock? Man, changing that thing would be criminally ineffective.
        I'm sure he can make it work if he uses his polygonal warcraft troll foot to detach it.
I wouldn't use AI generated imagery.
F1 Kill
Wonder how I landed in Australia
Have butt sex with the naked sleeping on the ground.

    Shit now I know who that was‚Ä¶
        bro?
Doorcamp
Be a begging gambler in out post living on tuna cans
Grow lots of weed and be too chill to kill so everyone just likes me because I give out free joints so then if anyone trys to attack me they gon get attacked by all the guys who don't want to lose the free joints.
People could kill me to take the weed but the simple fact that I'm the one who grows it and just gives it out is stops them because if they kill me then there's no one to grow the weed. Its a win win.
start a life in the buildings of outpost
Am I stuck as the real me or my character?

My real body get some clothes and become a mole person in one of the tunnels.

My character‚Ä¶.I would be shot in the beach as I did the helicopter.
Acquiring shoes as fast as possible
Collect human skulls from sleeping nakeds and become the bone knife king, then camp lighthouse/recycler. If I ever make a base it would have landmines/traps everywhere to the point where people would refuse to fck with me. I would build near fishing village and do all my farming at sea and tech tree everything.
Same thing as in game... Get turned into a greasy smear by somebody screaming in Russian or mauled by a bear.
Chill at a fishing camp, growing some hemp and fishing all day. Maybe scuba diving once in awhile just to switch it up. üòé
F1
F1 kill
Do I have knowledge of what the island is like? Headed right to harbor for a boat if so
Farm the ocean, find a tugboat, go to fishing village buy a rod and survive my days at sea until wipe.
2 pointy sticks
WELCOME TO RUST
I'm about to do trepanation to a stranger with my rock ASAP
Cry.. then, when i'm hungry, trying to find food.. and when a brown bear finds me, i die.. :)
Build a big ass walmart and win (real life lore)
I guess immediately get killed by fully geared people greifing. But if that didn't happen I would find a small island with no resources and build a base away from everyone.¬†
Well definitely not trusting anyone lol
Make contact with the tunnel dwellers. Bring gifts; blankets infected with bubonic plague fleas. Then take over the tunnels. Comps for life
F1 kill
Sit back, relax, and enjoy
Run from beach, live in outpost. Hope for a wipe.
Probably hitting a tree
Probably get mauled by the wildlife.
Time to live the rat life
I would probably start off the day by borrowing some bones from a sleeping friend or two
Jump into a compound and steal a clans mats
grub some geared guy
I'd go AFK and just wait for the regular human being to demolish my head with a stone.
Kollect vood
Get

off

the

beach
Depends if i immediately get my brains blown out by a roof camper.
Stoning every other naked sleeping on the beach, and then probably get my head popped off by a roofcamper
Drink the ocean
I will give up and offer myself to the closes outpost. I might be somebody's bitch I guess... But I ain't surviving otherwise.
Run to outpost
Get a boat and hit the ocean
Go back to sleep
Have had dreams about this and it‚Äôs terrifying
Run into outpost and look for full HQM AK group to make me their gimp
Become racist idk
You do actually wake up naked on a beach in Rust.
Running straight to outpost and living there all my life.
Make a rust video vlog first of its kind
Download cheats and roofcamp.
Oil
If I‚Äôm playing/living against other rust players I‚Äôm bookin it to outpost where I‚Äôll farm the occasional road sign for scrap to afford food and just learn how to play piano among other things. Assuming I‚Äôm playing/living 24/7 I‚Äôll eventually become tired and need to sleep, but can‚Äôt do it in outpost so I‚Äôd have to eventually make a base
Rushing the plain gather some weed to smoke, then head to first cave i find and bunker myself in
Bashing the first mother fucker I see with my rock
We would all turn into bush campers and door campers if this was for real
Find a place to hide, and lie low for two days. After that there'd be no one left in the world.
What‚Äôs wrong with bros foot üòÖüòÖ
I go to the cave that has those 2 build able spots right across from each other and setup my cringe un doorcampable unraidable base
Definitely heading straight to outpost and find out who I got to suck off to be a guard scientist.
Am I still a black lady
Do we have respawn capabilities? If so killing myself for a better spawn
Get this ai junk out of here
F1 kill
Rust 2 looking guud
Premeditated racism. That tends to get you into the biggest clans
Straight to the mushrooms, and grind up a bow. No time wasted
Umm, the same as it is in Rust. Run to the woods, build a shelter, get food.
Climbing the highest peak I can find, and then yeeting myself off it face first.
Run for the base of the nearest towering structure and stand just outside the door until they leave and dome them in the head with a rock, if that doesn't work I'm too late in the wipe.
Die‚Ä¶
Go to water and swim to oilrig
Thank god AI is still bad, anyways I don‚Äôt belong to this community goodbye
Bro got that goofy foot
F1 kill
Find a rock kill others
Do a walking dead and form a group to complete one objective.... Survive
Don‚Äôt die.
F1 kill
Guess I‚Äòd die lol
    I‚Äòd find myself a group of other capable players to build up a village of thriving survivors.
Probably hop into some compound and ecoraid into some roofboxes
I can tell you what I wouldn't do.

Feed whatever fucking prompt you put into the algorithmic image thief to get this monstrosity pretending to be art.
Let a bear rko me out of nowhere and maul me to death
If prob just grub until I got a good kit, then just camp out on the edge of the map.
Im sorry fists but we need wood and smashing a tree with a rock produces nothinf
Find a guitar n start trolling big bases
The fuck am I supposed to do, I‚Äôd probably freak, or get freaky
Check for skid marks before meeting other people.
I would hide at bandit camp
Alt f4
Actually not playing solo and joining a clan.
F1 
Kill
Man we need more context.  Do we get to respawn or not?
PLEASE BRING BACK SAVAS!!!
Swap off the nudity filter and get a pair of underwear for free
Wooden 2x2
I'd wake up pull a rock out of my pants and say " ahh Welcome to rust"
Kill my self
Knock down some trees, hit some stone nodes, make a stone 1x2 with a wood door and sleep all wipe
I‚Äôm going to fishing village. Getting my fishing pole from the quest and never leaving üòÇ
I'd go look for someone else to slap with a rock.
First check if I spawned a man or a woman.  If I was a man, I'd go : "Shit, I already played that in real life" :)
Def wouldn't start with asking AI to generate an AK for me, cuz wtf is that
    That foot though.
I'm toggling hacks and getting ak in 2 minutes
People waking up on the beach and looting surrounding in hope of finding a can of goods while being hunted, that sounds like 2024 Gaza strip.
This is the worst AI job I have ever seen.
Turning around and walking into the sea
    Looking for better respawn

Bruh if I had those awards I would have given you one

My neighbors probably think im a madman laughing now
I'm sure he can make it work if he uses his polygonal warcraft troll foot to detach it.
bro?
Step 1: Run straight to Outpost. Stop for mushrooms/cloth as needed.
Step 2: Hit barrels with rock around the Outpost. Pray for paddle drop so you can use that instead
Step 3: recycle all that you find until you can buy enough cloth/leather for armor (gloves are what you use), and stone/wood for base. 
Step: Make base near Outpost. Rinse Repeat. 

Outpost let's you straight up buy mats. And if offers a t1 work bench so you can tech tree. Progression is a little slower than running monuments but it's way safer.
‚ÄúCheesing‚Äù something in a video game means just using some of the video game mechanics (sometimes tedious) to make sure you won‚Äôt lose no matter what. Like hitting the barrels in safe zone or outpost and never leaving would be ‚Äúcheesing‚Äù it. 
It‚Äôs another way of saying using a cheap tactic to win basically.
    Got it, thanks for the explanation.

Where it all went wrong :(

Lemme go back to working 45-65 hour work weeks of looking for random shit to eat and store for winter, then dying at age 30 from a tiger
    A tiger? Nah man, more likely from a flu.
    If you are too dense to know that people lived to old age way back I don't know how to help you. You were more likely to die at birth or in childhood than adulthood, unless you went into combat. The child mortality rate is what brought down average life expectancy.
        Sharing more info here. If you made it to 7, you were likely to make it to 70. Unless there's a war, famine or pestilence. So, the 4 horsemen.
            war, famine, pestilence and children?
        Unless you die via a tiger at age 30. You don‚Äôt ‚Äúgo into combat‚Äù you go out so you can find random crap in the forest so you can get the calories you need for the day. If you‚Äôre too dense to know that this really isn‚Äôt all that serious, I don‚Äôt know how to help you.
Today we‚Äôre gonna be playing with lucky llama and blazed
    I fumbled the bag last time so here's hoping that doesn't happen again.
        Looks like there‚Äôs some good vending machines so let‚Äôs go see if we can jack hammer them
            I see a decayed base, maybe we will find some cheese
                Money????? Awwww‚Ä¶ No money.
                    This probably isn‚Äôt the smart move but ah cmon. Sometime you gotta risk it for the loot.
