[[Why is LBP3 so hated]]


Ik the fact that it’s a trashy buggy mess when you’re playing with others but playing thru the story mode alone or playing and creating levels is super fun. I love the story and characters they’re adorable and the story levels were SUPER fun same with the online ones. Why did it get such bad reviews?


As far as I'm aware, it was primarily the buggy state it released in. The bugs ranged from small, annoying, non-gamebreaking ones to the ones where the only fix was to delete your save and all it's progress to start again. I've heard a lot of people didn't like the new characters either. Not sure why as I really enjoyed the variance they bought to the puzzles and level design. Just sackboy for, like, 3-4 games before was starting to feel a little stale. 

I had to restart my save only once, but I was only a level or 2 into the game so no big loss for me. I didn't really play online either at the time. Mainly just my brother and I playing local coop. We both loved the game, but there is no pleasing everyone.
    Yeah fs. Idc that it gets hate I love it. I just don’t understand how people can’t love it u know other than the bugs. I had 1 game crash in all my playthru until I literally played 2 levels with a fiend and we broke a level and hard to both restart our games then his game crashed again later then mine crashed twice. Went back to single player and it was all good again lol
        That’s the thing, ppl really don’t have a problem with the game outside of the bugs. I’ve heard a few dislike the new characters but it’s rare that I ever hear somebody complain about that rather then the bugs.
    Swoop was the only new character that felt new to me. Toggle and the dog guy had abilities that could easily be given to sackboy with veeeeery little knowledge in create mode.
They are just sackboy with less potential. 

The game being bugged to oblivion was my biggest complaint when I got it. Made acing levels a pain when you would just fall out of levels... lmao idk, excessively long loading times for online content really put me off too. Feels like the series regressed in that regard.
For me it's missing that lbp charm, I love lbp1, 2 and vita the most. I hope some day they'll bring it back and do it proper justice.
I hated it for a very personal reason, but coincidentally, everyone else hated it for their own reason to. I kinda thought it had too many layers for the level maker but it was alright. But the story mode just wasn’t as good as the other game. The levels lost their homemade feel. Each level in LBP 1 and 2 was like a level you could make yourself. But in lbp3 with the hubs and quests, everything felt a bit too big. It didn’t feel as cozy. Plus for me, since I got it gifted it to me for the ps4, I lost all my progress from the PS3, which really sucked
    You have perfectly explained what I have been trying to put into words for 6 years now. \*Thank you\*
    It weirdly felt like it was both overambitious and too much of the same at once. Like they put time and complexity into the wrong parts of the game. In some ways, SABA feels like the game they actually wanted to make with the LBP franchise.
    That I get. This one prolly appealed to me more cuz I like bigger games
    I was one of those forced to jump from ps3 to ps4 and the loss of progress and access to dlc angered me something terrible. I had to buy back dlc from the special editions of the prequels, lost countless inventions due to the licensing for the dlc expiring and what not. I've lost and reclaimed my things across LB1P/2 but none of that compared to the pain with 3. I still play it, but I no longer have to time to recreate what I have lost.
I love it and absolutely hate this game.
Story was okay but I mostly care for the creative mode and online mode tbh and this game can't even deliver that.

Don't get me wrong, the creative mode is really fun but I like to build complex stuff 

(and this game has some awesome, materials, logic and overall possibility to create great stuff) 

But there's so many little bugs scattered around which make me want to throw my console out the window.

For example I've had a bug which occurred multiple times where the game just deletes the worked-on object when I rewind. And it wasn't possible to get it back no matter how much I undo or redo. So had to restart completely from scratch multiple times thanks to that bug.

There's another one which drives me crazy. When I create vehicles and its made of multiple layers (thin ones included) and I add a layer mover to it, the whole vehicles gets kinda deformed when I switch layers with it. 

These are just two of the most annoying ones from creative modr, which also aren't that rare and are still not fixed, since day one. And LBP2 never had any of those bugs. 

Also I bought the "journey home" pack for 5€ or 6€... Thought it may be fun. and I'm not able to play it, since the game just crashes and corrupts my profile when I start it. It's not a lot of money but it's still my money which went into this piece if crap of a game. Tried multiple times on different days to see if it's just a one time thing but it's still there.

This game should be removed from the PS Store tbh
    Aww man that sucks. I’m tryna platinum it before I play around with the creative mode and this made it seem like no fun
i see a lot of reason cited for why LBP3 was so bad, some people complained that the new playable characters suck, others bickered about how complicated create mode has become, there were even claims of the game losing it's charm

i can tell you that there's definitely one more problem plaguing LBP3 besides the bugginess, and that is the extremely long loading times on Hard Disk Drive.

the story mode's also a bit short, but knowing the game's development history that's perfectly understandable
1. The multiple character gimmick got old fast and ultimately was just that – a gimmick
2. We should’ve had the option to toggle between traditional 3 and 16 layers. The inability to do this has made quite a few LBP2 created levels unplayable or buggy.
3. The aesthetic doesn’t really match LBP1 and 2’s homemade handcrafted feel.
4. Characters aren’t as interesting as LBP2.
5. The game is STILL a nearly unplayable buggy mess, even after the patches
6. Some players’ (myself included) DLCs from LBP2 and 1 never carried over AT ALL and still won’t to this day
7. The UI is horrible
    For that 6th reason are you talking about PAID DLC or just the DLC you get from the GOTY version of LBP 1 and LBP 2 Special Edition?
        Both
    That’s fair. I like the characters a lot and I haven’t played too much online

    Bugs, Glitches and Profile Corruption
        Ohh lol. I didn’t find it buggy till I played co op
            Co op is huge for the series, with some levels exclusively playable with groups.
Apart from nostalgic reasons for the other games it‘s mostly about bugs and occasional long loading times. I did play quite a lot and really enjoyed it, but once my save-file corrupted, it was game over for me. If we ignore that it‘s a solid 8.5/10 for me.
    I didn’t even know save corruption was a thing and I’m hearing it a lot here and I’m scared now. Is this only a PS3 or 4 issue or does it happen on PS5 too?
        It happens on every platform. Do yourself a favor and back your save up weekly.
1 thing I don't see mentioned alot is broken lbp 1 and  2 levels
    This
        I used to not care about it because I mostly would play lbp 1 or 2 for their levels but you can't now
            Beacon is a thing, but it does require knowledge of how to h@ck your PS3
                I know about it
I also ordered a PSU for my PS3 just to play it
But sadly not all the levels are there
                    Yeah.... I get that
                Could you please explain to me how to access those servers?

Glitches and it lacks the classic LBP charm
    I hear a lot about LBP charm. What does that entail?
        It's kind of hard to describe , but I know for a fact that I agree. Some people cited a lack of a "homemade, handcrafted feel" that definitely is at least a factor.
            Even the second game lost that feeling, with the holograms and whatever else. The first game is easily the strongest in the franchise imo. 2 had much less focus on platforming bc the controlinator allowed for such drastic changes in gameplay, but that also made create mode infinitely better.
3... idk. I'm older now, maybe that's it. But the game didn't land well with me. Being a bugged mess didn't  help.
Yea, I always loved LBP3, got a couple weeks after launch for PS3 at a GameStop, never had any game breaking bugs throughout the years I played it. I know I am *EXTREMELY* lucky here but one of the worst bugs I personally experienced was my account messing up and doing that thing where all the levels go to the top of the planet, something which was caused by hackers and has eventually been fixed. I had some crashing and long load time but not very often. All in all, I adore all 3 LBP’s(I have played karting, PSP, and Vita, and I love them aswell)
    Eyy another LBP3 lover! Also I love ur name. My name is Daniel too lol
        Thanks, nice to meet ya fellow Daniel. I actually have a really anticlimactic story involving this username listed below if you’re interested.

if I’m being honest I kinda ripped off the name from a very small YouTuber who called themselves D2_the_avid since their name was David. They were part of a 2 person gaming channel called Fnd games who broke up many years ago. I as a kid when making my PlayStation account stole the idea and swapped the “avid” for “aniel”. I messed up when typing it in hence why I dropped an underscore. Since I wanted to have all my usernames the same I kept using variations of it for most websites including when I first made my Reddit account. I’ve swapped most my accounts names eventually but since Reddit doesn’t let you swap your account name(as far as I am aware) it is now stuck forever as u/D2the_aniel

You are the first person I have told this story to, Congratulations. If you are for any reason interested the channel was renamed Finbarhawkes after they split up, here’s a [link](https://youtube.com/@finbarhawkes).
The game corrupts your profile so often that you can't even play single player/create mode without losing everything constantly and having to reset. 

And that's when legitimately game breaking bugs aren't preventing you from starting the game, which I experienced and it turned LBP3 into a paperweight. No exaggeration.
I like it… I personally hate SABA
for me, its due to the fact that it bugs out so dang hard that youve got to delete saved progress, redo it and just HOPE that it doesnt do it again. i showed my bestie sackboy & lbp3 for the first time and weve stopped playing lbp3 altogether bc of it.
    Oof. Yeah I didn’t even know corruption was a thing and now I’m really concerned
        its miserable to deal with, truly. hopefully yours just lets you play🥹 & it being my bestfriends first time playing, i was so sad it did that to us! my ps4 wont let me download the first two even tho supposedly theyre backwards compatible so lbp3 & sackboy is all we have :/
            Thx man I hope mine doesn’t break too. It sucks that it was ur friend’s first experience with the series too. Do u know if this issue is on PS5 too? Me and my best friend both beat the game separately on our PS5s
                ive actually heard every game generally runs better and faster on ps5! so hopefully you’re good. just if you do come to a glitch, hopefully its not too far in!
                    I encountered so many glitches but only during multiplayer co op and none damaged my game. The worst is when my friend disappeared into a wall after being trapped in a door in the air jousting quest and we both had to restart our games to fix it. After that for some reason rewinding 9 times outta 10 would crash our games
                        the amount of times i had to explode just to get out of a place is gnarly 😂 i will say tho, ive had entirely way too much fun with sackboy, besides struggling with time trials. maybe ill jump back into lbp3 eventually, i want my bestie to play all the way through. especially bc i can’t download the first two
                            U should man. Years ago when I was 8 years old back in 2014 I watched JackSepticEye play the game and I fell in love with that video series and literally just a week ago I bought a copy on EBay to give it a shot and I loved it way more than I thought I would. It’s a fantastic game imo
                                i think i was 6 or 7 the first time i was introduced to lbp. thats all i played besides mk and my ds! (we had a gameboy system but my parents put it in storage when they bought their first playstation) the love i have for lbp games, my childhood self screams every time i play lol
                                    I get the feeling man lmao. There’s a few games that make me feel that way. I just wish I played LBP3 ages ago I love it. Now I have a copy of 1 and 2 in my EBay cart lol
One thing I ought to mention is that the buggy mess people mention only applies to the ps4 version, if you try the ps3 version, the game is more polished with stuff like profile corruption not happening at all.
I think the bugginess is what drove people away from it, I think besides the story mode being too short, it’s a great sequel as it adds so many creation tools and assets that it greatly expands the potential in what you can create. I feel this game still has some charm to it, as they do things LBP1 did like use stickers, materials, and decorations in creative ways in the story levels. 
If only the ps3 servers weren’t shut down so people could experience the polished LBP3.
everything changed once Mm left. for me anyway. i mean look at how the franchise has been left.
Multiplayer (the best part of the previous games) is still near unplayable sometimes
Cuz it’s unstable
it being a trashy buggy mess is why people hate it
Yeah fs. Idc that it gets hate I love it. I just don’t understand how people can’t love it u know other than the bugs. I had 1 game crash in all my playthru until I literally played 2 levels with a fiend and we broke a level and hard to both restart our games then his game crashed again later then mine crashed twice.

            U should man. Years ago when I was 8 years old back in 2014 I watched JackSepticEye play the game and I fell in love with that video series and literally just a week ago I bought a copy on EBay to give it a shot and I loved it way more than I thought I would. It’s a fantastic game imo
                i think i was 6 or 7 the first time i was introduced to lbp. thats all i played besides mk and my ds! (we had a gameboy system but my parents put it in storage when they bought their first playstation) the love i have for lbp games, my childhood self screams every time i play lol
                    I get the feeling man lmao. There’s a few games that make me feel that way. I just wish I played LBP3 ages ago I love it. Now I have a copy of 1 and 2 in my EBay cart lol
Yeah.... I get that

I encountered so many glitches but only during multiplayer co op and none damaged my game. The worst is when my friend disappeared into a wall after being trapped in a door in the air jousting quest and we both had to restart our games to fix it.
