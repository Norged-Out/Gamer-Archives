[[What is this game about Worth playing]]


I was digging up my old consoles, found my PS3 and  a copy of Little Big Planet, it was a game that I got included with the PS3. Was wondering what the entire game is about? Is it a platformer like super Mario with levels? 

I'm a big fan of chilled out platformer games so if I like this I could get little big planet 2 and then LBP 3 for the PS4.

Edit : Thanks for everyone's responses! I will play the game!


Basically, think Super Mario Bros. but the whole world is toys and that it’s all literally made with things you can create yourself, and co-op (real and online) can have up to four players on screen at once. First game is really beginner friendly for the most part and has a huge emphasis on creating levels and sharing them with the community. You collect items throughout the story mode to create your own levels, costumes, etc. You can also save your custom creations and collect theirs as well.

Do keep in mind though that the community has been DDOSed recently, so it won’t work until they announce it on their official Twitter. So you can’t just upload your levels right away or play other people’s levels until that gets fixed. Same goes for LBP2 and 3 since they all use the same servers. You can also import collected items from LBP1 into LBP2 and 3, and import collected LBP2 items into LBP3. All LBP1 and 2 DLC is compatible with LBP3, Karting, and Vita as well.

As for LBP2, it’s basically the same thing as 1 but with more emphasis on more complex creations with tools like “logic”. It’s not a whole lot different conceptually, but a lot of the new added elements are useful.

LBP3 kinda did the same thing that LBP2 did but with more lanes of dimensions and characters to work with. Not as much of big additions in comparison to 2, but some can be quite useful like quests and save states in individual levels and map worlds.

Overall though, I’d say that LBP1 is the most charming, LBP2 is the most stylistic/ambitious, and LBP3 is somewhat trying to be a combination of the two in the middle.

Also on another note, Karting’s online is no longer functional since they shut it down, same with the PSP game, and Vita has a very small community since barely anyone bought the device in the first place, but is still around at the time of writing this comment. And Sackboy: A Big Adventure has almost nothing to do with LittleBigPlanet other than the theming, most of the creative elements have been replaced with a game that more closely resembles Super Mario 3D Land/World. If you want LittleBigPlanet in the style of a 3D space though, the creators of LBP1 and 2 also made Dreams, which is basically a spiritual successor to that, though it’s a lot more complicated to build given how much more options there are. Still a great game though! And charming in its own different way, being artistic and all that.

So yeah, go ahead and play the main LittleBigPlanet games and Dreams! You’ll love them.

There’s also an indie/fan game being made for the PC called Restitched by Trixle Creative which is also very similar to at least LBP1. It’s still in development, but it looks promising so far. If you end up liking LBP1 and 2, you should check it out! Or at least bookmark it and keep it in mind.
It's a very solid platformer with a lot of emphasis on physics and a lot of charm, it's a bit like Mario but with more interaction with the world, there's tons of levels and as you play them you can collect up items to eventually build your own.
Just play the game and you'll find out. Trust me it's good.
It's a platformer, but also a whole lot more than a platformer with how unbelievably creative people have gotten with the game's expansive level creation tools.
Great games. Unfortunately the servers have been taken down by a DDOS attack. Massive community and unique levels made so hopefully they will be back. LBP 1 and 2 have the best story modes, very creative!
LBP is basically Super Mario Maker combined with Super Mario Bros and PlayStation
