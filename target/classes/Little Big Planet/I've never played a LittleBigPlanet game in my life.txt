[[I've never played a LittleBigPlanet game in my life]]





As you've probably guessed, it's adorable. Part of its concept is having a childlike, crafty aesthetic, which means a lot of great little visual details like the "grass" being stitched green cloth and the "clouds" being painted cardboard cut-outs hanging from strings.

It doesn't skimp on the music, either: in fact, one of the cool things about collecting items is that you can also collect soundtracks, and the song title and artist will be right there.

Because the series is designed for all ages, it's a good fit for new or casual gamers. Later on, though, some of the levels get fiendishly difficult.

You also get a great deal of creative range in customizing your sackling's appearance. The costumes are designed with that "children playing dress-up" aesthetic in mind: for example, in the Marvel pack, Wolverine's claws are popsicle sticks, and Captain America's A is scotch-taped to his helmet.
    OP said, "Tell me stuff about the game". They didn't specify. I figured other people would be better suited than I at describing the mechanics. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
    As a person that has never even seen gameplay of Little Big Planet, this doesn't tell me anything about what you do in the game it's just describing the art style or small features
        The gameplay is a slow-paced, momentum-based platformer. Sackboy is a stumpy slow character that doesn't jump very high, but his movement can be greatly accelerated by jumping out of moving objects. There is also a lot of environmental interaction, mostly through grabbing, pushing, and pulling sponge-like objects.
        It's Mario if it were cute, but just as hard.
A simple 2.5 platformer except the vibes are off the charts. Then you can make levels and publish them. Great soundtrack too. Most people‚Äôs memories of the game are tied with playing with friends, family, and random people online, which really was a blast. LBP2 is considered the best one. 

If you can buy a cheap ps3 and LBP1 or 2 at GameStop I‚Äôd really recommend it. Also pc emulations are becoming playable last I heard. But really, a lot of the joy came from playing with other people online and just messing around.
    I thought the consensus was that Vita was the best one, and 2 was right after?
        It goes Vita, 2, 1, PSP, Karting (I think), 3
            The first 3, absolutely, but I'm unsure where to put PSP, 3, and Karting in relation to each other.
                Yeah, I think that 3 is at the bottom, but it isnt bad, and Karting, PSP, and Vita I have no idea
            I don't count kart.
                It refrences the events of LBP2 so I count it
        But not many folks have a vita. I wish they supported it better.
it‚Äôs a video game
    No it's not. It's a lifestyle.
    gee thanks that helps a lot thank you (definitely not sarcasm)
Play The Bunker from LBP 1. Super Easy for begginers.
    This is so true, it was super easy for me my first time!
A masterpiece, but near worthless without it's online servers wich are gone

(And we don't talk a lot about lbp3 ps4)
    Not getting the community content is a crying shame, but the main games are still fun!
    Project lighthouse will bring em back soon, both for PS3 and vita.
        ü§û
        already has! by using rpcs3 (and a legal dump of your game disc) you can play online with friends, share and play community levels etc.

you can also do it by m\*dding your ps3
            Still think it's stupid that m\*dding is a banned word
    Regarding your opinion it is right
    There's nothing worth talking about when it comes to LBP3, to be honest.
The stuff the community makes is INSANE.
You just had to be there. That's all I can say, really.
    Honestly the truth. Golden age of online gaming.
You can get jiggy, and shake your sack booty.
    do the sack shaker
        Take your hands of it and shake it
            pull your zipper up I know you can do it
                SHAKE IT!
You missed out big time.
Lbp2. Some space vacuum is sucking up all the creative mind juices. Dementia ridden paper mache leonardo da Vinci, emotionally unstable (possibly cannibalistic) cake baking Marie curie wanna be, a severely depressed note pad man who owns a factory, a self absorbed roboticist (with impressive chest hair and snazzy sunglasses), an air headed Apple woman nurse thing, you a little cloth boy, and some clinically insane old man form an alliance to stop the space vacuum.
its goo d
In the first game you help an egg shaped mexican to reunite with his maniac wife and from then on they just hump eachother inside a big heart
The closest thing I can compare the LBP series is Roblox: the main mechanic is making your own levels and have them played by other players (back when servers for PS3 were still up), the level making is simple, but allows for quite complex levels (someone even made a calculator). However, it's a 2D platformer with multiple layers rather than a 3D game with free movement and programming like Roblox, multiplayer also allows for only 4 players max. It also has a very extensive player customization system allowing not only multiple pieces of clothing on player, but also allowing to put stickers on the player, allowing nearly endless customization
I dunno if this story is accurate, this took place nearly a decade ago so my memory might be fuzzy but Back in the early 2010‚Äôs there used to be a popular guy in the community called Latin_player_[insert a bunch of numbers I can‚Äôt remember] and I think he was infamous for coping other peoples levels and publishing them on his world without permission. he made a level that was a tribute to his dead dog with a sackbot dressed up as his dog with a halo on its head somewhere in the level. 90 percent of the pictures that people took were just them slapping the dog around. Good times.
A cardboard penguin tries to kill you. Then a vacuum tries to kill you. Then a lightbulb tries to kill you.

You can create anything you want. From a simple car, to a boat, to a rocket, to a spinning wheel of doom.
You kinda missed the peak of LBP since it is mostly centered around its community like Super Mario Maker 2 for example but you can still enjoy the community levels on LBP3 which isn‚Äôt a really well received entry though due to the added playable characters and levels being a little more complex than its other 5 games. You can start with LBP2 to go through the single player story. It has some levels and hidden secrets in the levels that do require more players though. Playing LBP with friends on couch co-op or online is where most of the fun comes in and if you still want to play entirely alone, you‚Äôll still get a decently fun experience out of it and even more so if you like creating your own levels. LBP on the PSP is an entirely single player game with no multiplayer whatsoever but still has a ton of community levels and even DLC levels. LBP PSVita is much closer to LBP2, just with a smaller scaled single player story. LBP is great but LBP2 improves upon it in every way. LBP Karting is just what it sounds. LBP3 can be fun since the online portion of the community hasn‚Äôt been officially shutdown on the PS4/PS5. LBP is a platformer at its core but can be whatever you want it to be
Back in the day, entering community levels or joining someone in Create mode felt like stepping into someone's Minecraft singleplayer game. They mag have spent hours designing the most beautiful level and made it a challenging platformer, or it might be bare with just some random objects scattered around that they got from other people's levels.

Sharing was one of the biggest parts of the game. make something, capture it as an object, stick it in a prize bubble and then anyone who collects that prize bubble gets the object and can put it in their levels.
It‚Äôs a game of creativity and fun! You can play create and share your creations to the world!there are three main games Lbp1 Lbp2 and Lbp3! The first to games are only available on ps3 while the third game is available on ps4 and ps5 but is a psplus exclusive.
the gameplay concept is pretty simple: you play as a sackperson in a physics-based platformer. you can grab objects made from sponge or any kind of fabric, allowing you to drag them or swing about. 

your basic goal in a level is to reach the end of it, but you can also collect prizes (more on them later), go for the highest score, or try beating the stage without dying. 

the real fun begins when you head over to your moon, where you can start creating your OWN stuff. you can make basically anything you can imagine in it, whenever it may be the platformer style levels shown in the story mode, nice sceneries, challenges, or even whole other games

you can then share these creations with the world and get internet points from them
Basically it was Minecraft for PlayStation kids. Limitless freedom (as long as it was in 3 lanes, we don‚Äôt talk about LBP3)
    minecraft was on playstation back in 2013 or so tho
        Little big planet was on there in 2008 and the 2nd lbp in 2011 so when I played lbp2 that was a long enough gap before I moved on to a pc and other hobbies
It was a wonderful, magical game. You missed out.
It was perfect. Perfect. Everything. Down to the last minute detail.
Great soundtrack.
like someone else said, you had to be there. it was perfect, down to the last minute details. It felt like a world of its own. You could do anything talk to anyone be whatever you'd like to be. I had a rough childhood I remember coming home from school and being excited to live my 2nd life on LBP2 and it really was that, a 2nd life. I don't think anything could come close to how it felt. 

I pray that we get a 4 before I'm too old to relive some of that life again.
It's sosooooooooo good, as is Sackboy. I've beaten all of them, but Sackboy.
I'm just letting you guys know that I don't have a PlayStation (yet)
Union Servers/Project Lighthouse exist guys. Not quite the same but still an option.

    cant help but wonder why you made the post then
All commenters, I would like to announce that i just got a PS5 and a copy of LBP3 it was super fun!
its good, though buy lbp3 for ps4/ps5 because its the only game with the servers working... :(
i spent hundreds on dlc in the first one
someone asking this makes me think of a huge montage of flashbacks of memories in lbp doing anything and everything you want. its the best sandbox multiplayer game i ever played and i pray it comes back
 Lil sackboy jumping around
A game where you play as a sewn together alien stuffed animal and jump on stuff
i played the game alot as a kid, but i never knew you could play online. kinda regret it.
I cant tell you the memories of meeting some really good friends and bonding through this game has been a once in a lifetime experience. I wouldn‚Äôt trade it for anything.
All you need to know is that it literally developed my creativity back when I was 4 years old. What‚Äôs not to love?

But do know that you should only play LBP3 on PS4 if you absolutely LOVE the other games.
Me and my friend almost died of laugh playing the bonus skate level.
The game where the community worships the second installment like its a religion or a cult, idk

...just... as good as LBP2 is... please give the other games attention, for crying out loud...
You can go to the moon and create a whole town there. Then kill everyone in that town.
Literally do whatever you want as long as it‚Äôs limited to three layers. Creativity is the limit.
Please play it, and with friends too this game is amazing
It silly

1 is the best minus its not online anymore
I‚Äôm incredibly sorry you never got to play these games in their prime
Just play it it's really fun
Just gather up some friends, and play it you‚Äôll have fun trust me ‚ò∫Ô∏è
The Bunker
It was just so much fun! Nothing really serious, the music was great and there was always new user levels to play. I miss it deeply.
