[[Jin is really a Man of the People]]





I simply assumed the locals willingly give Jin anything lying around, anything he needs to fight the Mongol invasion.
    Me as well. He needs resources for the war effort!!
        And to dye his shirt red
            [deleted]
                My roommate and I bust out laughing when he approached the White Dye Merchant, and proceeded to steal his flowers before giving them back to him for some dye.
                    "I'm sorry, you need three more flowers before I can craft that." 

*turns around* 
**YOINK**
"... Fine."
                    wait wait wait. White Dye? I found the Black Dye merchant but there's also a White one?!

EDIT: Of course, he is in the one big unexplored section of Izuhara that I have left. And I barely got 12 flowers on me. Sigh.
                        THERES SPECIALIZED DYE MERCHANTS WHAT?
                            Ikr. I found out by exploring a nearby cave on my way to the final tamoe mission.
                                WHEEEEERE

                        Where did you find Black Dye (no spoilers please)?

Im in Act 2
                            Believe it's on the east side of Kawamata Village in Toyotama.
                            There's also a nice side quest right next to the black dye merchant! Recommend playing that one, I thought it was a nice little story (kinda short though)
                            This little [guide](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-black-and-white-armor-dye-guide-/1100-6479842/) helped me.
                        Act 2 area left of wanderers pass I believe
                    You want how many flowers for blue? F***ING blue!
            You would think all the Mongolian blood would cover that
    That's a really good way to look at it.

Now I will want to take more from them! For the greater good =P
        they've unleashed a demon.
    I agree with this. Because you evidently don‚Äôt take everything that‚Äôs there. Also I don‚Äôt think that supplies mean food. It could be something else everytime.
        I always find it odd that the game use supply as currency, rather than, you know, actual currency.
            But it is war time in the island. In my country back in ww2 simple things like rice, oil, potatoes had more value than money. And there were people taking advantage of these times by selling simple things for insane amounts of money.
    They know that otherwise, there is a good chance that I'll stab them in the head with my katana.
    The only time I don't take shit is if it's lying out at a shrine or grave. I doubt Jin would stoop so low as to grave rob...but it is cool that Sucker Punch gives you the choice.
        If you don‚Äôt take the crickets you can‚Äôt play more songs on the flute.
    That's how I think about it, too. He's Lord Sakai, a samurai and fighting the Mongol Invasion. The people want to help in any way they can. They leave gifts at the altar, I'm just saving them from having to make the trip there.
Lmao, this is what I think of every time I go in to a peasants house, ‚Äúman I can‚Äôt believe those nasty Mongolians are stealing all our stuff... hmm, 8x iron, 12x supplies...‚Äù
    I love how in the very beginning, Jin protests against taking supplies from dead people and then an hour later you can basically loot living people who've had their lives savagely destroyed.
        In my head, I always say, "This is your contribution to the cause!" or some such nonsense.
            Lmao same, it‚Äôs the resistance‚Äôs tax
            If you don't use it the Mongols will.
            Toss a coin to your Witcher

                Damnit I was gonna write that...double damnit I wanna rewatch the series now triple damnit that songs in my head  now
                I knew I'd find this here
            When Kratos says we will use this for our expedition, when doing side quest. Even though you don‚Äôt need to do it at all.
                You do if you want to free the valkyrie
            Facts
            The price of "protection".
        99% of people aren‚Äôt gonna get this reference, but whatever: 

This reminds me of an old NES game called Gunsmoke. 

Whenever you bought a new weapon from peasants assisting you in the fight against the enemy they said something like ‚ÄúWe are on your side‚Äù, while charging you like $40k for a machine gun.
            We can upgrade your sword but it's going to cost enough iron and steel to arm the Shoguns army. We'll need like 30 trees of wax wood to upgrade your bow, and three wagons of linen to make your armor slightly better.
                And we mean ^*slightly,* my lord.
                    We do it for the looks
                        #*This is the way*
            Lol this has been an ongoing thing in most if not all games. Thanks for saving out island-what? Sure I‚Äôll sharpen your sword. For 25 gold.
                And the enemy drops are like 1~3 bronze coins ( 100 bronze= 1 silver, 100 silver= 1 gold). Cries in DA: origins
            Oh, I remember this game. The music from the first stage already in my head :D
        The worst is when you‚Äôre looting gifts left at gravesites. Eep.
        Can.  That's your choice of who he is as much as any other good or bad, warrior or thief,  fight or stealth,  emotional or poised, choice in the game.
    I always burst through the door like the Kool Aid man.
        Opening doors is slow and un-cool, and something peasants do. Sakai-Sama cuts them open like a cool, rich kid.
            It's a game, but I feel like shit when I cut open their doors in a occupied home; empty homes though you know what I'm doing. üòé
                I didn‚Äôt even know you could cut the doors down. Time for some property damage
                    Same
                I wish you could shoot through them. I mean, I know you can hit it with an arrow and break it, but I wish I could shoot through the paper to kill someone on the other side.
                    Really? (*I'm clearing the first island and still don't have me bow or stealth abilities*) I'm shocked you can't; especially after one of the trailera where you stab someone through the door.
                        You can assassinate through the door, but an arrow just shatters it open like a sword swing does.
                            Damn, probably just an afterthought or too difficult to code/work in without being jank maybe.
            I just wish the doors would stay open for more than half a second, during a certain mission this guy brings you to his house to talk in private. He goes ‚ÄúThis is my house come on in.‚Äù closes the door in your face lmao. I thought it was hilarious but it is kinda like wtf dude.
            I started cutting doors open so I would have to open them again when I leave the house lol
                Saaaaaame lmao I mean if you‚Äôre not gonna hold the door for me I gotta get in/out somehow üòè
        There is that one side quest where a lady says bandits stole her food, so you go and fight and kill the bandits and bring her the food and she's like "jk they didn't steal it I was just hungry." You don't kill her but you bet your ass I destroyed her doors, enjoy the cold you liar.
            Dude, I spent like 10 minutes doing that to make sure I didnt kill the bandits. Stealthing and if I got detected, running away. I was pissed when I came back, but glad I didnt kill them lol
                Oh damn I didn't even know not killing them was an option lol, I just mowed em down.
                    Yeah haha, when Jin said no promises, I was like bet. Sadly only caused dialogue afterwards to be Jin saying how thankfully he didnt have to kill them.
                        Fun tidbit: if you actually go back to the same house later in the game, she‚Äôs dead & there are 5 bandits to kill there. So, they come to try & take it back. Although, this happens whether you spare the initial bandits or kill them
        I didnt even know you could do this until yesterday when I accidentally did it lol
        > SUPPLIES!
            [Supplies, MotherFucker](https://i.imgur.com/aofrB9S.gifv)
    Haha agreed. When I'm immersed in the middle of a tale, I tend to not pick up as much stuff, but i do this a lot with the basic sidequests =P
    "You want me to kill mongols right? Well getting my sword professionally sharpened is expensive, and mongol flesh is quite dulling..."
    they've taken all our rice, my children are dying...

Jin: oh no... sorry ^(steals 4 leather) these barbarians ^(10 linen) will pay for what they ^(2 iron) have done Tsushima will be ours once again ^(1 sticky bomb and 18 supplies)
    Ya and im always sayin ‚Äúsorry for cutting through your door with my katana but sliding these doors is such a chore!‚Äù
        I do love how quickly Jin will open and close the doors lol
            Especially when someone's following directly behind him and get it slammed in their face for no reason
    Spoiler alert! If you steal the blue bag supplies from peasant‚Äôs houses you will miss the hidden trophy at the very end ;)
Awesome art. When I go in their houses I will sometimes cut through the doors, because its a very satisfying sound, and then I tell them imma take yo shit then imma help u.
    I cut down all doors just to show dominance
        Once I figured out there are no penalties I do it to avoid having to open the door on the way out. Granted the animation to sheath the katana probably takes as much time as just using the door normally.
            You can just use L2 to ready a ranged weapon to skip the sheathing animation if you want to.
                Who are you who are so wise in the ways of science?!
                    I wish I could take credit but someone else in this sub actually clued me into it. I love the sheathing animation but sometimes I‚Äôm in a rush!
                I prefer to sprint full on and bash my way through. Best reason to unlike the shoving technique
                    I agree I just run through usually cus why not and it looks cool af.
        Once I unlocked the moon stance I started kicking in every door I sawn
        [I wish you could just walk through them like Homer](https://youtu.be/mN2DCkJ4JsM)
    Wait, you can cut through doors?? How have I not figured that out yet
        I just figured out you can jump kick
            WHAT. Gonna go try that
            The nice thing about the jump kick is that it also breaks the enemy's guard/posture. Today I figured out that when you bow in front of non-mongolian corpses Jin will say something like for example that he is going to avenge them.
            The kick from the water stance?
        Same dude. Same.
            I only figured it out because I couldn't get used to r2 being the interact button. I spent the first few hours heavy attacking everything I saw, I'm so sorry horse...
                Going back to rdr2 after this will not be fun.

Trying to mount the horse, but instead puts a bullet in his head.
                    Omfg your right. Jeez, whoever set r2 as the action button is sadistic.
    Thanks!

Funnily enough, I feel more guilty about cutting through someone's door than stealing their supplies. I think about how much they will have to repair once the invasion is over and don't want to contribute to that =P
    I feel bad for doing that lol but I hate the open close door animation xD. I'm like ah well they gonna be cold tonight
    I like to yell ‚Äúdont worry im coming to help you!‚Äù As i cut through all their doors and steal everything not nailed down
Especially enjoy collecting the supplies and resources from survivor camps! I do agree that the resource grinding takes away from the game a little but we've come to expect it. Wish they just left that to the artifacts and records. Personally I'm thankful we don't have to get off our noble steeds to do it tho! Small victory. Such a great fuckin game overall tho.
    Grabbing resources while mounted is one of those quality of life things that most games should go with. Having a really cool skinning animation (RDR2), for example, is cool the first three times, but after that, what it adds to immersion has diminishing returns.

One of those 'can't see the trees for the forest' decisions in game design.
        While I can agree that quality of life game design is good, and I really appreciate the mounted looting in this game. There's something to be said for a game like red dead that has a slow deliberate pace to it. Life has such a go go go feel and it's nice to play a game that doesn't try to rush itself and instead takes every opportunity to immerse myself in the game world.

I can get down with both design philosophies.
            This. I wouldn't argue if they included a toggle for it, but I like my realism.
        Far Cry has skinning animations as well. But you can disable it. It saved me several hours over 3 games.
    I love the grinding i have fully upgraded all things other then 1 armor set
It's the Witcher 3 all over again
    Haha definitely something that most open world games with resource management runs into. I didn't feel this aspect was quite as pronounced in the Witcher 3. But that may be because not everyone you took from was ravaged by war...though many were.
        There's literally a Witcher comic with this same joke
            [Don‚Äôt mind me!](https://www.reddit.com/r/thewitcher3/comments/grsw7a/dont_mind_me/)
                I haven't seen that one before haha Love it =)
Is it wrong that I clean out there house before I talk to them? Lol üòÇ
    Same! I'm like hold on a second.. I'm gonna hear you out and avenge your family but let me get some supplies and iron to upgrade my shit first
    i make sure to get all the stuff first before i free the hostages üòÇ
    Same here. I always snoop around first before I talk to them. I actually feel mildly annoyed when a cutscene is triggered via proximity rather than an action cuz it interrupts my stealing haha
        It‚Äôs not stealing if there‚Äôs an R2
I just tell myself when I spend hundreds of supplies on my armor or bow, the merchant then takes most of those supplies and trades them back to the people for other stuff *he* needs, so it works out in the end.
    OoOoooo I like that. Though when talking to the merchants/smiths, they do make it sound like they need these materials specifically for your upgrade...I'm hoping they account for overhead, etc. in their price markup =P
        Yeah, they definitely need the steel, linen, etc. for your specific job, but surely if individual soldiers are carrying around single-digit amounts of "supplies," the merchant isn't going to eat hundreds by himself... he needs to buy his own clothes, tools, food for his horse, etc.
            That's true. Who knows what those generic supplies really are. Hopefully they're spreading the wealth =P
Y'all got anymore of that steel lying around?
    I‚Äôm sitting on enough steel and gold to fully upgrade, but I‚Äôm way short on iron somehow.
He's the LORD! He can do as he pleases to those pitiful peasants.

When I ride my horse across village or town, I just say: "Out of my way, peasants."
    He means no offense! I'm certain you all bathe regularly
I actually feel guilty when the peasants still give me a reward when I rescue them seeing how the war devastated their homes
    I always hear them say stuff like, "I want you to have this," but I never get a pop up of what they gave me, so I don't really know if they actually gave anything at all.
        They fill up a tiny portion of your Legend meter :)
            But. All encounters do that. So I assumed they gave something else.
                I think it‚Äôs supplies
    Is it weird that I sometimes admire the craftsmanship that some of the homes were produced with?

Like, damn, sucks that you were ransacked, but the wood in your homes and the carpentry is absolutely stunning.
        oh I do too haha I dont know why either, as normally I dont do that in games
    I don't specifically feel guilty, but I do sit there wondering why Jin would accept the peasants' offers haha
    While I do agree that taking the reward might seem kinda insensitive to some citizens of Tsushima, I actually think that Jin might actually view it as more polite to accept, that way the people helping him out know for a fact that they contributed, and that they have a stake in helping out The Ghost. They know that, however small their help was, they still helped Jin all the same, and thus they matter to Jin.

    I agree...and yet it doesn‚Äôt bother me much in this game for some reason. I think maybe because there is also equipment gated by missions and I‚Äôm a sucker for cosmetic changes when upgrading anything.
        Same. I fully upgraded the Ronin Gear just for the blacked out straw hat.... it had nothing to do with stats.. WORTH IT!
            All of my upgrades and choices in mission sets have to do with arthritics
                [deleted]
                    Lmao aesthetics is a hard word to type. God I do worry about my boy Jins joints tho. I know mine are fucked after two wars, and I did 99.9% much less jumping and hard landing than he does.
    True, but if they don't put resources in the houses and stuff, we most likey won't explore it
        This there needs to be some incentive to explore the little things.
        True, but then the only reason we are exploring is to gather those resources.
    There has to be some compromise between immersion and game. Explorers complain when you have doors you can't get into, yet an open world full of empty buildings isn't worth exploring.
    I can see where you're coming from. I personally don't mind shutting my mind off every now and then to go scrounge for material in games.

Specifically with Ghost though, I can see how this is one of the 'gamier' aspects of the game.
    It's still a video game so there is going to be video gamey stuff in it, and don't rob houses if you don't want to, they don't offer much anyway.
    I agree, maybe make it based on number of tales completed or something.
        That's the worst kind of equipment gating. It means playing further into the game to get gear than you have to otherwise. The best incentive to exploration is to hide things for players to find. Usually there are two types, items that don't add anything to game play but might have some lore attached or something even less worth while and game play relevant gear, i.e., crafting materials, armor, bonus items, etc.
I see it as payment for my good deeds.
You should make more comics like this!
    Thanks! I'll probably do a couple more as I run into more things that tickle me in the same way =)
There is a letter in lady sanjo's store room where she says Anyone touching something that's not their gets killed, 5 seconds later you have Jin grabbing some steel out of the store room lol
    "it's mine!"
*sakai enters room
SUPPLIES MOTHERFUCKER!
Walked into a house recently raided by Mongols, peasants yelling,‚Äù Lord Sakai, please help... the mongols have stolen everything!‚Äù

Sakai:‚ÄùBe with you in a minute...‚Äù

R2 R2 R2
And sometimes the way he enters these homes lol I slash the doors and no I tackle through the door with that skill
    It's the little things that Jin does to keep himself entertained in times of war =P
Not even a Mongol invasion will get you out of paying taxes to the man.
‚ÄúSupplies!! Motherfucker!‚Äù üòÇüòÇ
I used to go into some random guy‚Äôs house and bow to their face and see if they bow too. If they don‚Äôt I‚Äôll look at every nook and cranny inside and outside, the roof, ceiling, AND under his house for every single damn linen, bamboo, and supplies he got lying around.

Tax the shit out of him for the disrespect.
Technically the peasants and all of their belongings are owned by Jin and his family, during wartime a samurai could literally just walk into your house and tell you to give him whatever he needs and you would either do it or die
When I visit refuge camps or villages I take everything I can, and if there isn‚Äôt enough to please me, sometimes I‚Äôll slaughter some of their cattle so they know to do better next time.
Love it! Though, I kind of wish he was walking away playing the flute in the last frame
    Haha I thought about doing that, actually. In all honesty, I kinda just wanted to get back to playing and didn't feel like putting more time or energy into it.
        I don‚Äôt blame you at all
Ha. Classic RPG dilemma. Bugs me every time, completely feels like stealing from the destitute. I try to justify it as donating to 'the cause'
Games just can't get around this yet... I've ran into too many ransacked villages where people are just trying to put up a shelter, only to "collect" every item I can find and be on my way :/ What's better is the golden temple offerings where the people scrape together what little they have as an offering to help you out... it's messed up, Jin is probably doing way more harm then good in that regard :/
    One way to look at this is that the people are giving what they can to help the Ghost drive the Mongols away. Short term suffering for long term results.

But I also agree with you...it never feels like that Jin really needs the 12x Supplies from that one peasant you saved from being beheaded.
        I know that's what they're going for... But much like in uncharted where you're playing this fun loving treasure hunter that murders 100's of poeple and cracks jokes, Jin litterally walks around with a charm (if you opt to use it) that doubles and sometime triples your found items. He's the magical surviving Samurai trying to save his people, but hey, hero work doesn't come cheap right? Let me just tip-toe around your weak beaten form and take the only shiny bag you have left in the house, and thank you very much... They could have gotten around this with a different progression system and I'm sure they thought about it at some point but instead opted to go with what works. Fact is, when you have to find generic resources to upgrade attributes they always have to come from somewhere and that "path of least resistance" is part of the problem. Nothing Jin gets in game should really require you to steal from the people you're trying to save. And in the game's own context that doesn't make much sense. The armorer for example, needs resouces to improve your blade, yet we play missions that take you to sacred temples and dojos all over the island littered with rare discarded blades from fabled houses - why couldn't we retrive rare items from the world to give to the armorer and improve our gear that way rather then needing to gather generic resources. Could have been a whole other approach to progression and better yet, raiding Mongols could be transporting grear you need from one place to another making things that much more interesting. Wish they had something like that... 

And I wish they followed through with the combat claim that everyone involved in the fight has a hidden stamina meter so it's possible for a fight to go too long and everyone including jin is just wrecked trying to land hits - when they talked about it during development I immediatly thought of 13 Assassins which is an homage of sorts to Seven Samurai, but sadly that hasn't been the case yet. Still in ACT 1, playing on hardmode, the longer a fight goes the easier it is for the mongols to get fatigued, but Jin and pop some health and keep right on trucking :/
            I hear ya. There'll always be a discussion based around gameplay vs immersion balance. Some games know what they are: AC:Odyssey is heavily focused on their gameplay loop while TLOU2 is more focused on story (admittedly surface level observations.)

A fair bit of the game design decisions in Ghost seem to be designed around player immersion. I think for this reason, the mechanics that are more stereotypically game-like stick out a lot more than it would in some other games. Considering how much care they put into environmental navigation and minimal UI, I can see how their resource/upgrade system can come off as lazy or uninspired.

It doesn't really bother me as much as it just tickles me and makes me chuckle, but I totally get why some players would want the developers to go further with overall immersion/world logic if they're leaning that way to begin with.
                Solid points, as games and expectations change going into the next generation of consoles, pc's, etc... I've heard mulitiple developers talk about changing their thought process with a lot of the basics. Ghost is a great game, I love the open approach to combat, it's awesome to walk around in it, and the guiding wind mechanic is at least a step in the right direction :) I'm certainly not baulking at what we got in the end, maybe just a chuckle followed by a sigh for the resource mechanics is all :)
                    Yeah, next gen will be really interesting. Past couple generations (PS2/3) haven't had any really large leaps in game design philosophy. The past couple of years have been great, partially thanks to the indie boom and seeing that style of thinking move towards triple A development makes me optimistic.

Your points on finding weapons out in the wild and bringing them back to smiths makes a lot of sense to me. I wouldn't want there to be any kind of further inventory mechanics added, but it does bring the resource/upgrade system more in line with how immersive other parts of the game are.

Regardless =) Very happy with how this game is. Definitely the top game I've played this year.
                Yea the looting doesn't bother me since it's optional and could reflect the type of person you choose to make Jin. Maybe he's a person who talks big ideals but doesn't actually live by them or isn't as noble as he thinks he is. You can always, for example, refuse to gather supplies from peasants' homes, unless they explicitly offer them, if you think that would fit Jin's character more.

The thing that does bother me is the lack of narrative justification for some of our upgrades, especially the ghost weapons. I was surprised when I finished a certain mission and got a notification that I had unlocked kunai, but there was no cutscene or mission that ended with Jin deciding to use them or figuring out how to use them. Even a line of dialogue would have been fun. As it is it just seemed a bit disconnected, especially considering the care the game took in depicting Jim's first stealth kill. Same goes for the stances. I know Jin develops them from observing the Mongols, but some dialogue or a short cutscene to address this would have really added a lot.

Disclaimer: I've only unlocked 2 ghost weapons and the Water stance so far, so I have no idea if this is done more with the later upgrades.
            Well, there is a stamina bar, it's just not hidden and when you break it that's the shield/block break which usually opens a character up to instant death. Jin also doesn't have unlimited block stamina as far I know.
 I always ask the peasants... "What is your contribution to the war effort?!" And then I proceed to loot everything in sight.
Lol this is hilarious and so on point üòÇ
Quick question. When you rescue peasants from bandits/Mongols on the streets and they give you small gifts, do you actually receive anything or is it just an empty gesture because it never tells me that I've acquired anything
Lol totally, reminds me of the witcher
It was so awkward when I took supplies from a burnt out hut with two people crying inside. Gave me old-school PS1 looting vibes.
I also love how you can bust into any place, no matter how sacred, by smashing the door and then everyone acts like nothing happened.
it's like Link in Legend of Zelda, just randomly going into people's house looting and smashing jars everywhere, and no one bats an eye. I mainly enter buildings by slashing through the doors no matter what, it's just funny.
This is so perfect. I just finished Act 1 and it's been on my mind the whole time. Kinda wish the game handled this differently.
To his defense, Link did it first.
This made my day ü§£
I think about this too whenever I‚Äôm helping people but robbing them blind.
This really bothers me everytime
    They dont need it
    Then...don't take anything?
Lmaooo true
I feel especially bad after thoroughly picking a whole cemetery clean..
    Haha one way to look at it might be that these supplies would be wasted just sitting there waiting to be reclaimed by nature (or the Mongols!)
Hahaha yessss so truuue
Does it bother anyone else that Jin seems to be wearing his swords upside down?
    That's almost always how you wear those swords.  In traditional kendo and especially iaido, it's so you can strike in the same motion as the draw.

It should be noted though that samurai on horseback rarely used this method, since it was easier to draw from a "right-side-up" scabbard while mounted.  Because of this, you won't see this method used much in historical samurai paintings.  They tended to paint the general's who didn't leave their horse so much you know.
    This isn't really helpful, but I read some comments a while back about why samurai had their sword curving downwards. Apparently how they oriented their sheath changed throughout the centuries based off different techniques.

Don't take my word for it though haha Just what I read somewhere.
hahhaa thought of that too! like good thing i'm a Lord so people let me in their homes and I can take whatever I like lol
It's offering to resident samurai, protection fees
samurai were basically just mercenaries, so that's just payment
üòÇüòÇüòÇ so I‚Äôm not the only one
Lol, every time I‚Äôm shifting through a half burned town full of starving peasants looking for spare supplies I always feel bad, feels like each time I do that someone is going to die of screen of hunger.
    I just assume the supplies don't include food
I figure it's the plate of rice balls they could spare out of their whole stock. 

Gotta keep your warrior fed and all.
lol Jin kinda looks like Asian Solid Snake in this. ("A cyborg ninja!?")
Exact mindset.

I feel extra bad when I walk into any house with already broken/hole-filled doors.
‚ÄúThose animals killed her in cold blood‚Äù

THOSE SAVAGES! 

















*8x supplies*
Supplies muthafucker!
Worse when you realize he's a samurai lord and thus fairly rich judging by the standard of his estate and family graveyard.
Geralt would approve
I noticed this 5 minutes into the game lol.
To be fair to the game, it has Jin express that he does not wish to steal from these houses. You chooses to make him steal. I never do.
Feels especially bad when you go into houses of people that were taken over by bandits or something then raid the stuff around the corpses
"hey I have to make money somehow"
Listen the mongul will kill you then take your supplies. I will only take what ever is lying around but at least your alive lol.
please post this to the discord - this is hilarious!  [u/DeliriousTofu](https://www.reddit.com/user/DeliriousTofu/)
    Thanks! I don't use Discord very much, but feel free to post it yourself if you wish.
Hahaaha this is amazing.. I was thinking about this the whole time
Tweet this @ SuckerPunch
What? You thought samurai worked for FREE?
This is like Geralt of Rivia raiding a poor villagers home lmao
    All the shopkeepers in Skyrim who know better than to say anything about my theiving ass.
Need those mats to upgrade!
Yoink yoink yoink 

** so much honor, fatherrrrrrr **
It's weird that it's there in the first place, even if you played some RP style or whatever and never "stole" anything. Dude's telling me they took all his food and anything of value to the extent he's about to die, and then I found 42 "supplies" in his house and a bunch of other stuff randomly spread around his property.
    You don't know that it's food in there though

All the dudes got is a mystery bag and some ~~faggots~~ bundles of bamboo.  They even took his other shirt all he has left is scrap linen.  :(
Hahaha, yes man. Every time I "invade" someone's home just to steal their stuff I feel so bad LOL
Should have made him use the flute instead of whistling
These peasants are under my rule (well I‚Äôm second in line from the top, but that‚Äôs still high up the food chain). It‚Äôs their job to serve me. They should be gathering the materials themselves. I‚Äôm risking my life taking an entire invasion force on top of bandits and other outlaws I won‚Äôt name for spoiler reasons. This is for their benefit. And to do so I need to act in ways that force me to sacrifice my honour (something a samurai holds as paramount to the point they‚Äôll disembowel themselves to preserve it). I‚Äôm forced to act dishonourably you save their lives. The least they could do is get the supplies themselves.

Bloody ingrates!
I've been thinking this same thing to myself. Lol doesnt bother me though üòÅ
I always find it funny when I take a bunch of supplies from random villages and then my character angrily says ‚ÄúI am no thief‚Äù haha
Imma just count that as taxes
Lmao this is hilarious. Not gonna lie, I‚Äôve ran into half burnt houses with the owner inside crying and just took everything as they were thanking me and quickly made my exit by chopping through the only paper door left standing.
üòÇ
You don't take their food, supplies are needed for the war effort and bitchin armor.
Isn‚Äôt that how samurai really were anyways?  If they wanted something they just took it from the filthy peasants.
it's also pretty distracting during combat: found myself slasing Mongols and looting random supplies at the same time...
The loot in this game is laughable in honestly a very funny way. It feels like Outer Worlds where I basically just take everything without consequence. You can literally take upgrade materials sitting within the weapon smith‚Äôs shop... it‚Äôs very funny and ironic.
how did you got that posted. Memes, fan art and stuff like that doenst seems to be supported so far.
It‚Äôs funny because it‚Äôs true lol
Lol!!!
lmao this is hilarious. and when you cut down a door to enter instead of opening it has a similar humor.
I've seen this joke for the past 30 years for fucks sake it's never going to stop
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
I wish you could only collect supplies on Mongol occupied zones.
    I mean if you want just collect supplies from mongol zones then
A new settlement needs your help! ü§î
The design is very politician. üòÇ
Me as well. He needs resources for the war effort!!
    And to dye his shirt red
        [deleted]
            My roommate and I bust out laughing when he approached the White Dye Merchant, and proceeded to steal his flowers before giving them back to him for some dye.
                "I'm sorry, you need three more flowers before I can craft that." 

*turns around* 
**YOINK**
"... Fine."
                wait wait wait. White Dye? I found the Black Dye merchant but there's also a White one?!

EDIT: Of course, he is in the one big unexplored section of Izuhara that I have left. And I barely got 12 flowers on me. Sigh.
                    THERES SPECIALIZED DYE MERCHANTS WHAT?
                        Ikr. I found out by exploring a nearby cave on my way to the final tamoe mission.

                    Where did you find Black Dye (no spoilers please)?

Im in Act 2
                        Believe it's on the east side of Kawamata Village in Toyotama.
                        There's also a nice side quest right next to the black dye merchant! Recommend playing that one, I thought it was a nice little story (kinda short though)
                        This little [guide](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-black-and-white-armor-dye-guide-/1100-6479842/) helped me.
                    Act 2 area left of wanderers pass I believe
                You want how many flowers for blue? F***ING blue!
        You would think all the Mongolian blood would cover that
That's a really good way to look at it.

Now I will want to take more from them! For the greater good =P
    they've unleashed a demon.
I agree with this. Because you evidently don‚Äôt take everything that‚Äôs there. Also I don‚Äôt think that supplies mean food. It could be something else everytime.
    I always find it odd that the game use supply as currency, rather than, you know, actual currency.
        But it is war time in the island. In my country back in ww2 simple things like rice, oil, potatoes had more value than money. And there were people taking advantage of these times by selling simple things for insane amounts of money.
They know that otherwise, there is a good chance that I'll stab them in the head with my katana.
The only time I don't take shit is if it's lying out at a shrine or grave. I doubt Jin would stoop so low as to grave rob...but it is cool that Sucker Punch gives you the choice.
    If you don‚Äôt take the crickets you can‚Äôt play more songs on the flute.
That's how I think about it, too. He's Lord Sakai, a samurai and fighting the Mongol Invasion. The people want to help in any way they can. They leave gifts at the altar, I'm just saving them from having to make the trip there.
I love how in the very beginning, Jin protests against taking supplies from dead people and then an hour later you can basically loot living people who've had their lives savagely destroyed.
    In my head, I always say, "This is your contribution to the cause!" or some such nonsense.
        Lmao same, it‚Äôs the resistance‚Äôs tax
        If you don't use it the Mongols will.

        Facts
        The price of "protection".
    99% of people aren‚Äôt gonna get this reference, but whatever: 

This reminds me of an old NES game called Gunsmoke. 

Whenever you bought a new weapon from peasants assisting you in the fight against the enemy they said something like ‚ÄúWe are on your side‚Äù, while charging you like $40k for a machine gun.
        We can upgrade your sword but it's going to cost enough iron and steel to arm the Shoguns army. We'll need like 30 trees of wax wood to upgrade your bow, and three wagons of linen to make your armor slightly better.
            And we mean ^*slightly,* my lord.
                We do it for the looks
                    #*This is the way*
        Lol this has been an ongoing thing in most if not all games. Thanks for saving out island-what? Sure I‚Äôll sharpen your sword. For 25 gold.
            And the enemy drops are like 1~3 bronze coins ( 100 bronze= 1 silver, 100 silver= 1 gold). Cries in DA: origins
        Oh, I remember this game. The music from the first stage already in my head :D
    The worst is when you‚Äôre looting gifts left at gravesites. Eep.
    Can.  That's your choice of who he is as much as any other good or bad, warrior or thief,  fight or stealth,  emotional or poised, choice in the game.
I always burst through the door like the Kool Aid man.
    Opening doors is slow and un-cool, and something peasants do. Sakai-Sama cuts them open like a cool, rich kid.
        It's a game, but I feel like shit when I cut open their doors in a occupied home; empty homes though you know what I'm doing. üòé
            I didn‚Äôt even know you could cut the doors down. Time for some property damage
                Same
            I wish you could shoot through them. I mean, I know you can hit it with an arrow and break it, but I wish I could shoot through the paper to kill someone on the other side.
                Really? (*I'm clearing the first island and still don't have me bow or stealth abilities*) I'm shocked you can't; especially after one of the trailera where you stab someone through the door.
                    You can assassinate through the door, but an arrow just shatters it open like a sword swing does.
                        Damn, probably just an afterthought or too difficult to code/work in without being jank maybe.
        I just wish the doors would stay open for more than half a second, during a certain mission this guy brings you to his house to talk in private. He goes ‚ÄúThis is my house come on in.‚Äù closes the door in your face lmao. I thought it was hilarious but it is kinda like wtf dude.
        I started cutting doors open so I would have to open them again when I leave the house lol
            Saaaaaame lmao I mean if you‚Äôre not gonna hold the door for me I gotta get in/out somehow üòè
    There is that one side quest where a lady says bandits stole her food, so you go and fight and kill the bandits and bring her the food and she's like "jk they didn't steal it I was just hungry." You don't kill her but you bet your ass I destroyed her doors, enjoy the cold you liar.
        Dude, I spent like 10 minutes doing that to make sure I didnt kill the bandits. Stealthing and if I got detected, running away. I was pissed when I came back, but glad I didnt kill them lol
            Oh damn I didn't even know not killing them was an option lol, I just mowed em down.
                Yeah haha, when Jin said no promises, I was like bet. Sadly only caused dialogue afterwards to be Jin saying how thankfully he didnt have to kill them.
                    Fun tidbit: if you actually go back to the same house later in the game, she‚Äôs dead & there are 5 bandits to kill there. So, they come to try & take it back. Although, this happens whether you spare the initial bandits or kill them
    I didnt even know you could do this until yesterday when I accidentally did it lol
    > SUPPLIES!
        [Supplies, MotherFucker](https://i.imgur.com/aofrB9S.gifv)
Haha agreed. When I'm immersed in the middle of a tale, I tend to not pick up as much stuff, but i do this a lot with the basic sidequests =P
"You want me to kill mongols right? Well getting my sword professionally sharpened is expensive, and mongol flesh is quite dulling..."
they've taken all our rice, my children are dying...

Jin: oh no... sorry ^(steals 4 leather) these barbarians ^(10 linen) will pay for what they ^(2 iron) have done Tsushima will be ours once again ^(1 sticky bomb and 18 supplies)
Ya and im always sayin ‚Äúsorry for cutting through your door with my katana but sliding these doors is such a chore!‚Äù
    I do love how quickly Jin will open and close the doors lol
        Especially when someone's following directly behind him and get it slammed in their face for no reason
Spoiler alert! If you steal the blue bag supplies from peasant‚Äôs houses you will miss the hidden trophy at the very end ;)
I cut down all doors just to show dominance
    Once I figured out there are no penalties I do it to avoid having to open the door on the way out. Granted the animation to sheath the katana probably takes as much time as just using the door normally.
        You can just use L2 to ready a ranged weapon to skip the sheathing animation if you want to.
            Who are you who are so wise in the ways of science?!
                I wish I could take credit but someone else in this sub actually clued me into it. I love the sheathing animation but sometimes I‚Äôm in a rush!
            I prefer to sprint full on and bash my way through. Best reason to unlike the shoving technique
                I agree I just run through usually cus why not and it looks cool af.
    Once I unlocked the moon stance I started kicking in every door I sawn
    [I wish you could just walk through them like Homer](https://youtu.be/mN2DCkJ4JsM)
Wait, you can cut through doors?? How have I not figured that out yet
    I just figured out you can jump kick
        WHAT. Gonna go try that
        The nice thing about the jump kick is that it also breaks the enemy's guard/posture. Today I figured out that when you bow in front of non-mongolian corpses Jin will say something like for example that he is going to avenge them.
        The kick from the water stance?
    Same dude. Same.
        I only figured it out because I couldn't get used to r2 being the interact button. I spent the first few hours heavy attacking everything I saw, I'm so sorry horse...
            Going back to rdr2 after this will not be fun.

Trying to mount the horse, but instead puts a bullet in his head.
                Omfg your right. Jeez, whoever set r2 as the action button is sadistic.
Thanks!

Funnily enough, I feel more guilty about cutting through someone's door than stealing their supplies. I think about how much they will have to repair once the invasion is over and don't want to contribute to that =P
I feel bad for doing that lol but I hate the open close door animation xD. I'm like ah well they gonna be cold tonight
I like to yell ‚Äúdont worry im coming to help you!‚Äù As i cut through all their doors and steal everything not nailed down
Grabbing resources while mounted is one of those quality of life things that most games should go with. Having a really cool skinning animation (RDR2), for example, is cool the first three times, but after that, what it adds to immersion has diminishing returns.

One of those 'can't see the trees for the forest' decisions in game design.
    While I can agree that quality of life game design is good, and I really appreciate the mounted looting in this game. There's something to be said for a game like red dead that has a slow deliberate pace to it. Life has such a go go go feel and it's nice to play a game that doesn't try to rush itself and instead takes every opportunity to immerse myself in the game world.

I can get down with both design philosophies.
        This. I wouldn't argue if they included a toggle for it, but I like my realism.
    Far Cry has skinning animations as well. But you can disable it. It saved me several hours over 3 games.
I love the grinding i have fully upgraded all things other then 1 armor set
Haha definitely something that most open world games with resource management runs into. I didn't feel this aspect was quite as pronounced in the Witcher 3. But that may be because not everyone you took from was ravaged by war...though many were.
    There's literally a Witcher comic with this same joke
        [Don‚Äôt mind me!](https://www.reddit.com/r/thewitcher3/comments/grsw7a/dont_mind_me/)
            I haven't seen that one before haha Love it =)
Same! I'm like hold on a second.. I'm gonna hear you out and avenge your family but let me get some supplies and iron to upgrade my shit first
i make sure to get all the stuff first before i free the hostages üòÇ
Same here. I always snoop around first before I talk to them. I actually feel mildly annoyed when a cutscene is triggered via proximity rather than an action cuz it interrupts my stealing haha
    It‚Äôs not stealing if there‚Äôs an R2
OoOoooo I like that. Though when talking to the merchants/smiths, they do make it sound like they need these materials specifically for your upgrade...I'm hoping they account for overhead, etc. in their price markup =P
    Yeah, they definitely need the steel, linen, etc. for your specific job, but surely if individual soldiers are carrying around single-digit amounts of "supplies," the merchant isn't going to eat hundreds by himself... he needs to buy his own clothes, tools, food for his horse, etc.
        That's true. Who knows what those generic supplies really are. Hopefully they're spreading the wealth =P
I‚Äôm sitting on enough steel and gold to fully upgrade, but I‚Äôm way short on iron somehow.
He means no offense! I'm certain you all bathe regularly
I always hear them say stuff like, "I want you to have this," but I never get a pop up of what they gave me, so I don't really know if they actually gave anything at all.
    They fill up a tiny portion of your Legend meter :)
        But. All encounters do that. So I assumed they gave something else.
            I think it‚Äôs supplies
Is it weird that I sometimes admire the craftsmanship that some of the homes were produced with?

Like, damn, sucks that you were ransacked, but the wood in your homes and the carpentry is absolutely stunning.
    oh I do too haha I dont know why either, as normally I dont do that in games
I don't specifically feel guilty, but I do sit there wondering why Jin would accept the peasants' offers haha
While I do agree that taking the reward might seem kinda insensitive to some citizens of Tsushima, I actually think that Jin might actually view it as more polite to accept, that way the people helping him out know for a fact that they contributed, and that they have a stake in helping out The Ghost. They know that, however small their help was, they still helped Jin all the same, and thus they matter to Jin.
I agree...and yet it doesn‚Äôt bother me much in this game for some reason. I think maybe because there is also equipment gated by missions and I‚Äôm a sucker for cosmetic changes when upgrading anything.
    Same. I fully upgraded the Ronin Gear just for the blacked out straw hat.... it had nothing to do with stats.. WORTH IT!
        All of my upgrades and choices in mission sets have to do with arthritics
            [deleted]
                Lmao aesthetics is a hard word to type. God I do worry about my boy Jins joints tho. I know mine are fucked after two wars, and I did 99.9% much less jumping and hard landing than he does.
True, but if they don't put resources in the houses and stuff, we most likey won't explore it
    This there needs to be some incentive to explore the little things.
    True, but then the only reason we are exploring is to gather those resources.
There has to be some compromise between immersion and game. Explorers complain when you have doors you can't get into, yet an open world full of empty buildings isn't worth exploring.
I can see where you're coming from. I personally don't mind shutting my mind off every now and then to go scrounge for material in games.

Specifically with Ghost though, I can see how this is one of the 'gamier' aspects of the game.
It's still a video game so there is going to be video gamey stuff in it, and don't rob houses if you don't want to, they don't offer much anyway.
I agree, maybe make it based on number of tales completed or something.
    That's the worst kind of equipment gating. It means playing further into the game to get gear than you have to otherwise. The best incentive to exploration is to hide things for players to find. Usually there are two types, items that don't add anything to game play but might have some lore attached or something even less worth while and game play relevant gear, i.e., crafting materials, armor, bonus items, etc.
Thanks! I'll probably do a couple more as I run into more things that tickle me in the same way =)
"it's mine!"
It's the little things that Jin does to keep himself entertained in times of war =P
Haha I thought about doing that, actually. In all honesty, I kinda just wanted to get back to playing and didn't feel like putting more time or energy into it.
    I don‚Äôt blame you at all
One way to look at this is that the people are giving what they can to help the Ghost drive the Mongols away. Short term suffering for long term results.

But I also agree with you...it never feels like that Jin really needs the 12x Supplies from that one peasant you saved from being beheaded.
    I know that's what they're going for... But much like in uncharted where you're playing this fun loving treasure hunter that murders 100's of poeple and cracks jokes, Jin litterally walks around with a charm (if you opt to use it) that doubles and sometime triples your found items. He's the magical surviving Samurai trying to save his people, but hey, hero work doesn't come cheap right? Let me just tip-toe around your weak beaten form and take the only shiny bag you have left in the house, and thank you very much... They could have gotten around this with a different progression system and I'm sure they thought about it at some point but instead opted to go with what works. Fact is, when you have to find generic resources to upgrade attributes they always have to come from somewhere and that "path of least resistance" is part of the problem. Nothing Jin gets in game should really require you to steal from the people you're trying to save. And in the game's own context that doesn't make much sense. The armorer for example, needs resouces to improve your blade, yet we play missions that take you to sacred temples and dojos all over the island littered with rare discarded blades from fabled houses - why couldn't we retrive rare items from the world to give to the armorer and improve our gear that way rather then needing to gather generic resources. Could have been a whole other approach to progression and better yet, raiding Mongols could be transporting grear you need from one place to another making things that much more interesting. Wish they had something like that... 

And I wish they followed through with the combat claim that everyone involved in the fight has a hidden stamina meter so it's possible for a fight to go too long and everyone including jin is just wrecked trying to land hits - when they talked about it during development I immediatly thought of 13 Assassins which is an homage of sorts to Seven Samurai, but sadly that hasn't been the case yet. Still in ACT 1, playing on hardmode, the longer a fight goes the easier it is for the mongols to get fatigued, but Jin and pop some health and keep right on trucking :/
        I hear ya. There'll always be a discussion based around gameplay vs immersion balance. Some games know what they are: AC:Odyssey is heavily focused on their gameplay loop while TLOU2 is more focused on story (admittedly surface level observations.)

A fair bit of the game design decisions in Ghost seem to be designed around player immersion. I think for this reason, the mechanics that are more stereotypically game-like stick out a lot more than it would in some other games. Considering how much care they put into environmental navigation and minimal UI, I can see how their resource/upgrade system can come off as lazy or uninspired.

It doesn't really bother me as much as it just tickles me and makes me chuckle, but I totally get why some players would want the developers to go further with overall immersion/world logic if they're leaning that way to begin with.
            Solid points, as games and expectations change going into the next generation of consoles, pc's, etc... I've heard mulitiple developers talk about changing their thought process with a lot of the basics. Ghost is a great game, I love the open approach to combat, it's awesome to walk around in it, and the guiding wind mechanic is at least a step in the right direction :) I'm certainly not baulking at what we got in the end, maybe just a chuckle followed by a sigh for the resource mechanics is all :)
                Yeah, next gen will be really interesting. Past couple generations (PS2/3) haven't had any really large leaps in game design philosophy. The past couple of years have been great, partially thanks to the indie boom and seeing that style of thinking move towards triple A development makes me optimistic.

Your points on finding weapons out in the wild and bringing them back to smiths makes a lot of sense to me. I wouldn't want there to be any kind of further inventory mechanics added, but it does bring the resource/upgrade system more in line with how immersive other parts of the game are.

Regardless =) Very happy with how this game is. Definitely the top game I've played this year.
            Yea the looting doesn't bother me since it's optional and could reflect the type of person you choose to make Jin. Maybe he's a person who talks big ideals but doesn't actually live by them or isn't as noble as he thinks he is. You can always, for example, refuse to gather supplies from peasants' homes, unless they explicitly offer them, if you think that would fit Jin's character more.

The thing that does bother me is the lack of narrative justification for some of our upgrades, especially the ghost weapons. I was surprised when I finished a certain mission and got a notification that I had unlocked kunai, but there was no cutscene or mission that ended with Jin deciding to use them or figuring out how to use them. Even a line of dialogue would have been fun. As it is it just seemed a bit disconnected, especially considering the care the game took in depicting Jim's first stealth kill. Same goes for the stances. I know Jin develops them from observing the Mongols, but some dialogue or a short cutscene to address this would have really added a lot.

Disclaimer: I've only unlocked 2 ghost weapons and the Water stance so far, so I have no idea if this is done more with the later upgrades.
        Well, there is a stamina bar, it's just not hidden and when you break it that's the shield/block break which usually opens a character up to instant death. Jin also doesn't have unlimited block stamina as far I know.
They dont need it
Then...don't take anything?
Haha one way to look at it might be that these supplies would be wasted just sitting there waiting to be reclaimed by nature (or the Mongols!)
That's almost always how you wear those swords.  In traditional kendo and especially iaido, it's so you can strike in the same motion as the draw.

It should be noted though that samurai on horseback rarely used this method, since it was easier to draw from a "right-side-up" scabbard while mounted.  Because of this, you won't see this method used much in historical samurai paintings.  They tended to paint the general's who didn't leave their horse so much you know.
This isn't really helpful, but I read some comments a while back about why samurai had their sword curving downwards. Apparently how they oriented their sheath changed throughout the centuries based off different techniques.

Don't take my word for it though haha Just what I read somewhere.
I just assume the supplies don't include food
Thanks! I don't use Discord very much, but feel free to post it yourself if you wish.
All the shopkeepers in Skyrim who know better than to say anything about my theiving ass.
You don't know that it's food in there though

All the dudes got is a mystery bag and some ~~faggots~~ bundles of bamboo.  They even took his other shirt all he has left is scrap linen.  :(
I mean if you want just collect supplies from mongol zones then
And to dye his shirt red

        My roommate and I bust out laughing when he approached the White Dye Merchant, and proceeded to steal his flowers before giving them back to him for some dye.
            "I'm sorry, you need three more flowers before I can craft that." 

*turns around* 
**YOINK**
"... Fine."
            wait wait wait. White Dye? I found the Black Dye merchant but there's also a White one?!

EDIT: Of course, he is in the one big unexplored section of Izuhara that I have left. And I barely got 12 flowers on me. Sigh.
                THERES SPECIALIZED DYE MERCHANTS WHAT?
                    Ikr. I found out by exploring a nearby cave on my way to the final tamoe mission.

                Where did you find Black Dye (no spoilers please)?

Im in Act 2
                    Believe it's on the east side of Kawamata Village in Toyotama.
                    There's also a nice side quest right next to the black dye merchant! Recommend playing that one, I thought it was a nice little story (kinda short though)
                    This little [guide](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-black-and-white-armor-dye-guide-/1100-6479842/) helped me.
                Act 2 area left of wanderers pass I believe
            You want how many flowers for blue? F***ING blue!
    You would think all the Mongolian blood would cover that
they've unleashed a demon.
I always find it odd that the game use supply as currency, rather than, you know, actual currency.
    But it is war time in the island. In my country back in ww2 simple things like rice, oil, potatoes had more value than money. And there were people taking advantage of these times by selling simple things for insane amounts of money.
If you don‚Äôt take the crickets you can‚Äôt play more songs on the flute.
In my head, I always say, "This is your contribution to the cause!" or some such nonsense.
    Lmao same, it‚Äôs the resistance‚Äôs tax
    If you don't use it the Mongols will.
    Toss a coin to your Witcher
        Toss a sen to your specter~~~
            Oh isle of nothinggg ~~~
        Damnit I was gonna write that...double damnit I wanna rewatch the series now triple damnit that songs in my head  now
        I knew I'd find this here
    When Kratos says we will use this for our expedition, when doing side quest. Even though you don‚Äôt need to do it at all.
        You do if you want to free the valkyrie
    Facts
    The price of "protection".
99% of people aren‚Äôt gonna get this reference, but whatever: 

This reminds me of an old NES game called Gunsmoke. 

Whenever you bought a new weapon from peasants assisting you in the fight against the enemy they said something like ‚ÄúWe are on your side‚Äù, while charging you like $40k for a machine gun.
    We can upgrade your sword but it's going to cost enough iron and steel to arm the Shoguns army. We'll need like 30 trees of wax wood to upgrade your bow, and three wagons of linen to make your armor slightly better.
        And we mean ^*slightly,* my lord.
            We do it for the looks
                #*This is the way*
    Lol this has been an ongoing thing in most if not all games. Thanks for saving out island-what? Sure I‚Äôll sharpen your sword. For 25 gold.
        And the enemy drops are like 1~3 bronze coins ( 100 bronze= 1 silver, 100 silver= 1 gold). Cries in DA: origins
    Oh, I remember this game. The music from the first stage already in my head :D
The worst is when you‚Äôre looting gifts left at gravesites. Eep.
Can.  That's your choice of who he is as much as any other good or bad, warrior or thief,  fight or stealth,  emotional or poised, choice in the game.
Opening doors is slow and un-cool, and something peasants do. Sakai-Sama cuts them open like a cool, rich kid.
    It's a game, but I feel like shit when I cut open their doors in a occupied home; empty homes though you know what I'm doing. üòé
        I didn‚Äôt even know you could cut the doors down. Time for some property damage
            Same
        I wish you could shoot through them. I mean, I know you can hit it with an arrow and break it, but I wish I could shoot through the paper to kill someone on the other side.
            Really? (*I'm clearing the first island and still don't have me bow or stealth abilities*) I'm shocked you can't; especially after one of the trailera where you stab someone through the door.
                You can assassinate through the door, but an arrow just shatters it open like a sword swing does.
                    Damn, probably just an afterthought or too difficult to code/work in without being jank maybe.
    I just wish the doors would stay open for more than half a second, during a certain mission this guy brings you to his house to talk in private. He goes ‚ÄúThis is my house come on in.‚Äù closes the door in your face lmao. I thought it was hilarious but it is kinda like wtf dude.
    I started cutting doors open so I would have to open them again when I leave the house lol
        Saaaaaame lmao I mean if you‚Äôre not gonna hold the door for me I gotta get in/out somehow üòè
There is that one side quest where a lady says bandits stole her food, so you go and fight and kill the bandits and bring her the food and she's like "jk they didn't steal it I was just hungry." You don't kill her but you bet your ass I destroyed her doors, enjoy the cold you liar.
    Dude, I spent like 10 minutes doing that to make sure I didnt kill the bandits. Stealthing and if I got detected, running away. I was pissed when I came back, but glad I didnt kill them lol
        Oh damn I didn't even know not killing them was an option lol, I just mowed em down.
            Yeah haha, when Jin said no promises, I was like bet. Sadly only caused dialogue afterwards to be Jin saying how thankfully he didnt have to kill them.
                Fun tidbit: if you actually go back to the same house later in the game, she‚Äôs dead & there are 5 bandits to kill there. So, they come to try & take it back. Although, this happens whether you spare the initial bandits or kill them
I didnt even know you could do this until yesterday when I accidentally did it lol
> SUPPLIES!
    [Supplies, MotherFucker](https://i.imgur.com/aofrB9S.gifv)
I do love how quickly Jin will open and close the doors lol
    Especially when someone's following directly behind him and get it slammed in their face for no reason
Once I figured out there are no penalties I do it to avoid having to open the door on the way out. Granted the animation to sheath the katana probably takes as much time as just using the door normally.
    You can just use L2 to ready a ranged weapon to skip the sheathing animation if you want to.
        Who are you who are so wise in the ways of science?!
            I wish I could take credit but someone else in this sub actually clued me into it. I love the sheathing animation but sometimes I‚Äôm in a rush!
        I prefer to sprint full on and bash my way through. Best reason to unlike the shoving technique
            I agree I just run through usually cus why not and it looks cool af.
Once I unlocked the moon stance I started kicking in every door I sawn
[I wish you could just walk through them like Homer](https://youtu.be/mN2DCkJ4JsM)
I just figured out you can jump kick
    WHAT. Gonna go try that
    The nice thing about the jump kick is that it also breaks the enemy's guard/posture. Today I figured out that when you bow in front of non-mongolian corpses Jin will say something like for example that he is going to avenge them.
    The kick from the water stance?
Same dude. Same.
    I only figured it out because I couldn't get used to r2 being the interact button. I spent the first few hours heavy attacking everything I saw, I'm so sorry horse...
        Going back to rdr2 after this will not be fun.

Trying to mount the horse, but instead puts a bullet in his head.
            Omfg your right. Jeez, whoever set r2 as the action button is sadistic.
While I can agree that quality of life game design is good, and I really appreciate the mounted looting in this game. There's something to be said for a game like red dead that has a slow deliberate pace to it. Life has such a go go go feel and it's nice to play a game that doesn't try to rush itself and instead takes every opportunity to immerse myself in the game world.

I can get down with both design philosophies.
    This. I wouldn't argue if they included a toggle for it, but I like my realism.
Far Cry has skinning animations as well. But you can disable it. It saved me several hours over 3 games.
There's literally a Witcher comic with this same joke
    [Don‚Äôt mind me!](https://www.reddit.com/r/thewitcher3/comments/grsw7a/dont_mind_me/)
        I haven't seen that one before haha Love it =)
It‚Äôs not stealing if there‚Äôs an R2
Yeah, they definitely need the steel, linen, etc. for your specific job, but surely if individual soldiers are carrying around single-digit amounts of "supplies," the merchant isn't going to eat hundreds by himself... he needs to buy his own clothes, tools, food for his horse, etc.
    That's true. Who knows what those generic supplies really are. Hopefully they're spreading the wealth =P
They fill up a tiny portion of your Legend meter :)
    But. All encounters do that. So I assumed they gave something else.
        I think it‚Äôs supplies
oh I do too haha I dont know why either, as normally I dont do that in games
Same. I fully upgraded the Ronin Gear just for the blacked out straw hat.... it had nothing to do with stats.. WORTH IT!
    All of my upgrades and choices in mission sets have to do with arthritics
        [deleted]
            Lmao aesthetics is a hard word to type. God I do worry about my boy Jins joints tho. I know mine are fucked after two wars, and I did 99.9% much less jumping and hard landing than he does.
This there needs to be some incentive to explore the little things.
True, but then the only reason we are exploring is to gather those resources.
That's the worst kind of equipment gating. It means playing further into the game to get gear than you have to otherwise. The best incentive to exploration is to hide things for players to find. Usually there are two types, items that don't add anything to game play but might have some lore attached or something even less worth while and game play relevant gear, i.e., crafting materials, armor, bonus items, etc.
I don‚Äôt blame you at all
I know that's what they're going for... But much like in uncharted where you're playing this fun loving treasure hunter that murders 100's of poeple and cracks jokes, Jin litterally walks around with a charm (if you opt to use it) that doubles and sometime triples your found items. He's the magical surviving Samurai trying to save his people, but hey, hero work doesn't come cheap right? Let me just tip-toe around your weak beaten form and take the only shiny bag you have left in the house, and thank you very much... They could have gotten around this with a different progression system and I'm sure they thought about it at some point but instead opted to go with what works. Fact is, when you have to find generic resources to upgrade attributes they always have to come from somewhere and that "path of least resistance" is part of the problem. Nothing Jin gets in game should really require you to steal from the people you're trying to save. And in the game's own context that doesn't make much sense. The armorer for example, needs resouces to improve your blade, yet we play missions that take you to sacred temples and dojos all over the island littered with rare discarded blades from fabled houses - why couldn't we retrive rare items from the world to give to the armorer and improve our gear that way rather then needing to gather generic resources. Could have been a whole other approach to progression and better yet, raiding Mongols could be transporting grear you need from one place to another making things that much more interesting. Wish they had something like that... 

And I wish they followed through with the combat claim that everyone involved in the fight has a hidden stamina meter so it's possible for a fight to go too long and everyone including jin is just wrecked trying to land hits - when they talked about it during development I immediatly thought of 13 Assassins which is an homage of sorts to Seven Samurai, but sadly that hasn't been the case yet. Still in ACT 1, playing on hardmode, the longer a fight goes the easier it is for the mongols to get fatigued, but Jin and pop some health and keep right on trucking :/
    I hear ya. There'll always be a discussion based around gameplay vs immersion balance. Some games know what they are: AC:Odyssey is heavily focused on their gameplay loop while TLOU2 is more focused on story (admittedly surface level observations.)

A fair bit of the game design decisions in Ghost seem to be designed around player immersion. I think for this reason, the mechanics that are more stereotypically game-like stick out a lot more than it would in some other games. Considering how much care they put into environmental navigation and minimal UI, I can see how their resource/upgrade system can come off as lazy or uninspired.

It doesn't really bother me as much as it just tickles me and makes me chuckle, but I totally get why some players would want the developers to go further with overall immersion/world logic if they're leaning that way to begin with.
        Solid points, as games and expectations change going into the next generation of consoles, pc's, etc... I've heard mulitiple developers talk about changing their thought process with a lot of the basics. Ghost is a great game, I love the open approach to combat, it's awesome to walk around in it, and the guiding wind mechanic is at least a step in the right direction :) I'm certainly not baulking at what we got in the end, maybe just a chuckle followed by a sigh for the resource mechanics is all :)

    Solid points, as games and expectations change going into the next generation of consoles, pc's, etc... I've heard mulitiple developers talk about changing their thought process with a lot of the basics. Ghost is a great game, I love the open approach to combat, it's awesome to walk around in it, and the guiding wind mechanic is at least a step in the right direction :) I'm certainly not baulking at what we got in the end, maybe just a chuckle followed by a sigh for the resource mechanics is all :)
        Yeah, next gen will be really interesting. Past couple generations (PS2/3) haven't had any really large leaps in game design philosophy. The past couple of years have been great, partially thanks to the indie boom and seeing that style of thinking move towards triple A development makes me optimistic.

Your points on finding weapons out in the wild and bringing them back to smiths makes a lot of sense to me. I wouldn't want there to be any kind of further inventory mechanics added, but it does bring the resource/upgrade system more in line with how immersive other parts of the game are.

Regardless =) Very happy with how this game is. Definitely the top game I've played this year.
    Yea the looting doesn't bother me since it's optional and could reflect the type of person you choose to make Jin. Maybe he's a person who talks big ideals but doesn't actually live by them or isn't as noble as he thinks he is. You can always, for example, refuse to gather supplies from peasants' homes, unless they explicitly offer them, if you think that would fit Jin's character more.

The thing that does bother me is the lack of narrative justification for some of our upgrades, especially the ghost weapons. I was surprised when I finished a certain mission and got a notification that I had unlocked kunai, but there was no cutscene or mission that ended with Jin deciding to use them or figuring out how to use them. Even a line of dialogue would have been fun. As it is it just seemed a bit disconnected, especially considering the care the game took in depicting Jim's first stealth kill. Same goes for the stances. I know Jin develops them from observing the Mongols, but some dialogue or a short cutscene to address this would have really added a lot.

Disclaimer: I've only unlocked 2 ghost weapons and the Water stance so far, so I have no idea if this is done more with the later upgrades.
Well, there is a stamina bar, it's just not hidden and when you break it that's the shield/block break which usually opens a character up to instant death. Jin also doesn't have unlimited block stamina as far I know.
My roommate and I bust out laughing when he approached the White Dye Merchant, and proceeded to steal his flowers before giving them back to him for some dye.
    "I'm sorry, you need three more flowers before I can craft that." 

*turns around* 
**YOINK**
"... Fine."
    wait wait wait. White Dye? I found the Black Dye merchant but there's also a White one?!

EDIT: Of course, he is in the one big unexplored section of Izuhara that I have left. And I barely got 12 flowers on me. Sigh.
        THERES SPECIALIZED DYE MERCHANTS WHAT?
            Ikr. I found out by exploring a nearby cave on my way to the final tamoe mission.
                WHEEEEERE

        Where did you find Black Dye (no spoilers please)?

Im in Act 2
            Believe it's on the east side of Kawamata Village in Toyotama.
            There's also a nice side quest right next to the black dye merchant! Recommend playing that one, I thought it was a nice little story (kinda short though)
            This little [guide](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-black-and-white-armor-dye-guide-/1100-6479842/) helped me.
        Act 2 area left of wanderers pass I believe
    You want how many flowers for blue? F***ING blue!
Toss a sen to your specter~~~
    Oh isle of nothinggg ~~~
Damnit I was gonna write that...double damnit I wanna rewatch the series now triple damnit that songs in my head  now
I knew I'd find this here
You do if you want to free the valkyrie
And we mean ^*slightly,* my lord.
    We do it for the looks
        #*This is the way*
And the enemy drops are like 1~3 bronze coins ( 100 bronze= 1 silver, 100 silver= 1 gold). Cries in DA: origins
I didn‚Äôt even know you could cut the doors down. Time for some property damage
    Same
I wish you could shoot through them. I mean, I know you can hit it with an arrow and break it, but I wish I could shoot through the paper to kill someone on the other side.
    Really? (*I'm clearing the first island and still don't have me bow or stealth abilities*) I'm shocked you can't; especially after one of the trailera where you stab someone through the door.
        You can assassinate through the door, but an arrow just shatters it open like a sword swing does.
            Damn, probably just an afterthought or too difficult to code/work in without being jank maybe.
Saaaaaame lmao I mean if you‚Äôre not gonna hold the door for me I gotta get in/out somehow üòè
Oh damn I didn't even know not killing them was an option lol, I just mowed em down.
    Yeah haha, when Jin said no promises, I was like bet. Sadly only caused dialogue afterwards to be Jin saying how thankfully he didnt have to kill them.
        Fun tidbit: if you actually go back to the same house later in the game, she‚Äôs dead & there are 5 bandits to kill there. So, they come to try & take it back. Although, this happens whether you spare the initial bandits or kill them
Who are you who are so wise in the ways of science?!
    I wish I could take credit but someone else in this sub actually clued me into it. I love the sheathing animation but sometimes I‚Äôm in a rush!
I prefer to sprint full on and bash my way through. Best reason to unlike the shoving technique
    I agree I just run through usually cus why not and it looks cool af.
Going back to rdr2 after this will not be fun.

Trying to mount the horse, but instead puts a bullet in his head.
    Omfg your right. Jeez, whoever set r2 as the action button is sadistic.
I haven't seen that one before haha Love it =)
I think it‚Äôs supplies
[deleted]
    Lmao aesthetics is a hard word to type. God I do worry about my boy Jins joints tho. I know mine are fucked after two wars, and I did 99.9% much less jumping and hard landing than he does.
