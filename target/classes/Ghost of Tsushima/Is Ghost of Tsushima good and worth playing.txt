[[Is Ghost of Tsushima good and worth playing]]


Is it good?


It's genuinely one of the games I consider a must-play. It's gorgeous, has a good story, and is fun to play mechanically. The first game I got platinum on my PS5
    Couldn’t say it better. Also my first plat on the PS5
    It's the reason I bought a PS5! Looking forward to getting the platinum.
    Damn, apparently I have to replay it. I got bored and turned it off. It’s a beautiful game, but just felt slow and drawn out.
        If you do decide to try it out again, may I recommend using Japanese dialogue with subtitles? I’ve always preferred dubs over subs when it comes to all media, I know I’m not right in the head, but for this game it genuinely adds to the immersion. I’ve heard great things about the English voice actor for the main character but playing it with Japanese dialogue made it so badass.
            I played on Hard on first playthrough (English)
Then on new game plus i played on Lethal (Japanese Audio with Samurai Cinema)
                I gotta do it samurai cinema style one day
            Based off everyone’s comments I have to give it another stab. 

I would bet most people probably prefer Dubs over Subs. I prefer Subs; makes it more realistic. That’s how I do all my movies, too. I’m convinced that if Prey, the most recent Predator movie, would have used the language of the native it would have been better. 

I regress, I played it with Japanese Dialogue, and you’re right, it was completely immersive. But, yeah, I’m convinced by the Handsome folks here that I should play it again.
            I played on Hard on first playthrough (English)
Then on new game plus i played on Lethal (Japanese Audio with Samurai Cinema)
            Don’t the subs distract?  I guess in battle you’re reading npcs
                Yea in combat I’m not really paying attention to the subs. Mainly during cut scenes or when you have a companion that’s giving you instructions during breaks in between combat.
        Not every game is for everyone, I totally get that. I do recommend you re-visit it though! It's a genuinely good game that I couldn't put down once I got into it.
        First half yes, second half is much better and even the side quests get better
        I did that first 2 times I played it now on my way to Main story and New game plus plat
        I felt the same way about it once I got to act 2 of the game.Took like a month break off from it and got through the game. The combat was great, but story and side missions needs work.  Maybe act 2 was drag on a lil too far. Thank God, I have the ps5 directors cut version. I felt like the dlc side of the game (iki island) was better.
    This
    Haven’t no life’s a game the way I did GoT in a bit. Luckily I was off work and just played 3 days from wake until sleep only stopping to eat 😂
        I’m a Registered Nurse and gaming keeps my head cool lol. I’m about to have 12 days off straight I cannot wait to continue this game and a bunch of others
    Gameplay mechanics is so top notch. The game is a gamers game not a bunch of cut scenes etc.
    Top 1 in open world games for me.
    Same!
    I loved this game. I didn’t get to it until last year, but it’s one of very few platinums that I have gotten that I wish there was still more to do. Most games (looking at you Hogwarts Legacy) have worn out their welcome by the time I get to the platinum. I am seriously considering playing it all again on ps4. I can’t wait for the sequel.
Played 1000+ games in my life, GoT is in my all time top3.
    What are your 2 top games
    What are you top 10 games, I need inspiration for games to play.
        Death stranding is a great, chill game when burning the devils lettuce.
            Downloading as I've just had some sweet butterleaf lettuce. Cheers cobba
            I appreciate the love for death stranding, and the brand new sentence
            I find death stranding to be the most boring game with the most interesting story ever. I want to play the game just to know the story but man the gameplay is extremely boring to me.
        Outer Wilds, God of War, Ghost of Tsushima, Asura's Wrath, Everhood, SuperHOT, and Metal Gear Rising Revengeance are games I love off the top of my head.
            Literally downloaded Tsushima because of this comment. You got taste kid.
            Outer Wilds is a masterpiece
            I like that you aren't even the person who said the thing about GoY being a top 3 game but you decided to rattle off your favorite games without context. Thats not weird.
        1. Horizon Forbidden West (play the prequel Horizon Zero Dawn to understand the story)

2. The Uncharted series

3. The Tomb Raider series

4. Ratchet and Clank

5. Control

6. Infamous Second Son
            Horizon Zero Dawn is the 1st one. Forbidden West is the sequel.

All nice choices anyway, not played Control yet but I've heard good things. What's it like?
                Thanks, corrected. First off - I recommend you play it on a PS5 because I faced frame rate drops, slight texture load delays, and a noticeable pause after I returned to the game from the menu on my PS4 Pro.

Nothing game breaking, but still.

And Control makes you feel like a bad ass. I'd compare it to what I finished most recently - Infamous Second Son. 

You've got superpowers like Delsin Rowe, but there's a heavier plot, creepier enemies, and the building in which the game takes place in is sprawling, brutalist, and weird.

Once you've mastered the combat, you can dispatch enemies with ease, and even then it's thrilling.

It's a fucking fun game!

It will probably be a while before I get a PS5 but I'm glad I'm eligible for a free upgrade since I bought a physical copy for my PS4.
                    It's not a prequel either haha don't worry, I know what you mean ;) Just thought I'd let you know, a prequel is something that comes after the original but takes place before it.

And I can imagine, it's a big game. Unfortunately I'm in the same boat as you as I don't have a PS5 yet either but I have a physical copy of it too so I guess I could wait. Plenty of other great games in the meantime. Although, I did play the beginning of Forbidden West and completed the whole tutorial area and I didn't notice anything too bad performance-wise but I bet the game gets more intense once the map starts opening up and everything else. Poor PS4 will sound like a hairdryer on full blast, you know how it is haha

Love inFamous, I remember I used to have the first one with Cole and the electric powers when I was a kid. Such a cool game, Second Son was sick the way you could have 4 powers and all the special attacks once you build your Karma up. Choosing between good and bad for different powers and changes in the story. First Light was cool too playing as Fetch (was that her name?) the girl with the neon powers and the map is nice too, rainy Seattle, also home to my favourite bands, Alice in Chains and Soundgarden to name a couple. Got the platinum for that game. Good times.

Control sounds like my type of thing then, I prefer a darker tone. I should definitely get around to it one day.
                Coming here a year later to say if you havent played control to play control lol. 

Game got me HOOKED on everything Remedy and even SCP-universe related. I've never been more invested in the universe of a series than the control / alan wake "remedyverse" - and control 2 is one of my most anticipated games in, well, ever. I havent really been "excited" for a game in, I dunno, 10+ years?

The deep-rooted and wild universe/story it throws you into is worth so much more than any gameplay IMO. I read wiki articles on the game's lore. WIKI ARTICLES. Lmao. Only ever game to send me to the Wiki for entertainment was the dark soul's series
        If you are looking for PlayStation games: red dead 2, the last of us 1 & 2, Both God of Wars, Hollow Knight, Titanfall 2, bloodborne, dishonored 2, returnal, outer wilds, Horizon games, and yes Ghost of Tsushima
For me it's what Ubisoft assassins creed game should be like. If you liked any assassins creed at all then you will love GoT
    I haven’t like ac since black flag and that was 10 years ago but I love GoT
        I just said this the other day. Assassins creed walked to GoT could run.
    I liked Assassin's Creed but I didn't love Ghost of Tsushima. P.S. I played Assassin's Creed from the first one until Unity.
        Lol You got off the train at the perfect time.
            Unity was great
                Agreed. But it was awful on release. o i put it down and played it 2 years later to thoroughly enjoy it.
    So true. It’s assassin’s creed with a fear meter and samurai dueling.
        Much more. With different stances, with different utilities it's much better plus hose main side stories were great and well created.
Good to see but repetitive
Yes. I went in blind with this one and was blown away by how stunning it is. Also, when you get good at fighting, it feels really badass to take out entire camps without getting hit. There's plenty of side stuff to do as well but it's not so much that it becomes a chore. Definitely worth checking out friend.
    Yea it was nicely balanced. Enemies get harder the further you get. But your stick skills improve a ton over time and the ninja weapons you unlock along the way integrate so seamlessly into combat.
I will say this, gameplay for Ghost of Tsushima is a bit simplistic and standard, but there's nothing wrong with that. Having simple gameplay  that slowly builds up to some incredible encounters makes it a fun experience that is enhanced by the storytelling and presentation.  And while the story is very much a Kurosawa movie with some modern elements of morality and the duality of guerilla warfare (Also not a knock, that's what they were going for and they hit it with perfection).

The presentation is where the game absolutely shines.  Every area is designed with incredible detail and fidelity, and the amount of color, serenity, and beauty creates a dichotomy between the harsh reality of war you enter when facing off against the Mongols.  Each side story blends even further to fleshing out the world, and is more and more meaningful.
    Couldn’t agree more. This is a spot on description of GoT.
Idk, but people gush about it like its the best game ever created so its probably at least worth getting on sale.
It didn’t click with me personally. But I can’t deny it’s beautiful and there’s a lot to do. I’ve tried a couple times to go back to it. Even then I’d recommend trying it out for yourself
It’s honestly one of the few games I consider a must play tbh it’s very VERY good
I’m gonna offer a bit of an explanation to my opinion which I hope is more objective than just saying it’s good or bad so you can decide. 

Firstly, the art style is my number 1 game of all time. Just the very over the top, exaggerated like maple trees next to a lake with candle lanterns on it at night. I absolutely LOVE. 

Combat is definitely what Assassin’s Creed should have become. It truly is the correct evolution to the original AC combat system that was much needed instead of what they did with the newer games. 

With the exception of the tales of your friends, I thought the side quests were quite repetitive. 

The main story had a very good start that started to get a little boring for me. But I stuck through it and it was well worth it. For me, after maybe 10 main story quests that were a bit boring towards the early stages of the game, the rest of the game was phenomenal. So if that’s the same for you, stick through it for a little longer and you’ll likely have the same experience. 

Overall, I’d give it an 8/10 which for me is a damn good rating. I do highly recommend this game - I think it is a must play for any story game enjoyer. The pros far far far outweigh the cons and the cons weren’t even that bad. 

I hope you enjoy it as much as I did! :)
    I have the same opinion on GoT with regards to the side quests. and unfortunately, I did not stick through it. Its just that they lack the back stories, which may have contributed to the feeling of repetitiveness.

But in terms of combat, presentation and fluidity of movements, etc, its up there.
It's a sold 7 for gameplay.  A 5 for story.  And a 9 for visuals.

So...a 7.5 overall?
    Agree.
People seems to love the gameplay but the fights are more or less always the same. Chose correct stance for enemy type and parry.
    Facts. 

I’ve always felt like I was on an island when I said it was a solid C of a game. Passing grade but nothing that I would call great with probably the most predictable main story line in recent years.
        Games rarely have good stories anyway imo.

People praise Plauge tale, and by the end of the second game, I wanted to blow my brains out. Wasn't even inherently bad. I just felt like I got beat over the head with bad plot for no reason.

Tsushima, while predictable, told a story that was drcent. Which is more than most games can say recently besides a select few. It's rare now a days for a studio to put a compelling story blended with actual fun gameplay.
            The way you felt with Plague Tale (I haven’t played either game, but they’re on my list) is how I felt with Tsushima, only I didn’t get through an entire game before deciding I wanted to go to the hardware store to buy 12 ft of rope and a three-legged stool. 

Didn’t help the fact that I played the game as a perfect samurai with no stealth (other than when the game forced me to on a few missions) so the ending felt 100% at odds with how I actually played the game. It could’ve really used a meter similar to RDR2 that had branching implications later on. That’s far from original but it would be a vast improvement on what we got. But why do that when you can just copy and paste the 48th fox shrine on the map? 

Horizon Zero Dawn has a better story. God of War has a better story. I didn’t love Ragnarok or Forbidden West but the main line stories are better than GoT. LoU 1 and 2 are both better. Spiderman is probably equally predictable entirely due to character familiarity, but Miles Morales had a better story. And those are just PS first party games.
depends on if you like open world games or not. it’s pretty much just like all the other ones.
Yes
Yes
Yes.
Yes
Yes
Lol yes
In my opinion it is always worth trying a game if you have the opportunity to do so. This is my personal and subjective opinion on the basic version of Ghost of Tsushima played at the release on PS4 Pro: I liked GOT but I didn't find anything so exceptional. Personally I consider it a good game, but apart from the setting, the art direction, the combat system and the idea of wind driving I consider it a totally forgettable game and after the first act I got bored but only occasionally and it made me feel the repetitiveness due to the missions and secondary activities of the open world. I specify that video games hardly bore me and repetitiveness is rarely a problem, for example I do not get bored farming on Warframe, face the same boss on souls or on other games etc ... also a few days after finishing GOT I started Death Stranding and I played it for a month for about 162 hours without ever getting bored and without feeling the repetitiveness.
I....uh.... honestly I'm trying to decide if this is a joke post. It's one of the best games to come out in the last 10 years and has been reviewed that way consistently. Not sure why this even need to be asked.
    You're right that it's very acclaimed, but there are definitely people that don't like it. Personally I couldn't stand it. Definitely in the minority there though.
    Right! It's been out long enough to know if it's truly a good game without asking internet strangers. Opencritic, Metacritic , YouTube..  there are so many ways to see if a game is good with legitimate thought out answers and reviews , but apparently asking reddit is easier ?
        Sometimes it's nice to hear from random people who are not critics, YouTube is good but it's blocked on my devices for good reason. Let a brother ask reddit.
just play it and form your own opinion. Dont wait for someone to tell you its good to find out :)
    But games are expensive and I finish them too fast so I need to if they are good before I buy them.
        Understandable! I usually watch a quick bit of gameplay or, there’s a guy on youtube who does “before you buy” videos for a lot of really popular games and does pretty good (relatively spoiler free) reviews that go into gameplay, balance, story, progression, etc. I can try and find his channel if you’re interested
            I would be very happy if you try to find his channel for me.
                [this is his review of the ghost of tsushima director’s cut](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kbSozPzaNlA) but it sounds like he focuses more on the new addional content in that area as opposed to the base game. He does have a review for the base game as well on his channel
                    Thanks!
        thats totally understandable :) i run through games too fast sometimes too. 

i always put them on hard from the jump now and try to complete as much as i can to get my moneys worth.  The game is actually pretty good. get the bundle that comes with the dlc. i hope you enjoy it!
        If you have PS plus extra you can get GoT and the expansion for free
Yes
It's a great/beautiful game. That said....I found myself having to push myself to beat it. It got very monotonous for me doing the same things over and over again.
game is ABSOLUTELY carried by visuals. starts out alright but my  god it gets so stale and repetitive so fast it's amazing. not to mention the story sucks complete balls. if you've played an assassins creed game you've played a better version of this game already.
Why is this question asked every fucking 2 weeks man. 

Yes it is fucking good. Rather than make a new thread just scroll through the threads before..
Considering a side mission that I will not spoil made me tear up and take a 5 minute break to catch myself, I’d say it’s worth it
That game in Lethal difficulty is a Must play. 100% recommended. Try to play it in the most elevated difficulty possible for you in order to not ruin the experience and make you feel like a real Samurai 👌🏽
If i played it like 6-7 years ago when I was really into assassins creed games I would have loved it

I found it kinda meh, very pretty game tho and cool mechanic of leading you to objectives
Meh…just another pretty 3rd person game doing a loosely inspired Dark Souls fight system. 
If you’ve played 1 over the last 10 years, you’ve played them all.
I found the story boring as fuck. The game play too, same thing over and over and over. BEAUTIFUL game tho. Gorgeous.
    I agree. Was let down by the repetitiveness of it. Seemed like it was dragged out and clearing out bases was the same as story missions. Shouldn't have to play it on hardest difficulty to feel like I'm not a god.
    Same. Started strong. Got bored quickly and abandoned
        As much as I hate to say it, also same. You can pet foxes tho and that's a plus.

I definitely don't think it's a bad game though
    Agree with this - gorgeous in terms of both graphics and art style, but game play, story and characters will not live up to the ridiculously high praise this game gets. I’d recommend getting it but people really need to cool it on giving people ridiculously high expectations
    Story definitely is boring, but gameplay isn't is like you say.

It's fun and even tense and challenging if you play on harder difficulties.

Also the stealth is pretty fun, like a next generation Assassin's Creed
        youre both wrong.
            ok dad :c
                exactly
* lemme ask if one of the most popular playstation exclusives is good on the playstation sub*
Best single player game I’ve ever played.
Was my favorite ps5 game until Elden ring
    Why did this get downvoted lol? He has a different opinion, get him.
Excellent story, extremely satisfying stealth, deep combat, beautiful visuals, plenty of optional content, steady and balanced character progression. I absolutely adore this game and consider it a must-play.
I have started it a few days ago and honestly, so far it didn’t catch me at all. 

Other than how good it looks (although the character models aren’t that great) I’m having a hard time enjoying it.
Géneric , repetitive , ubisoft like formula
is this s joke post?
To each its own

I've seen a lot love it in the first 5 min then there the small percentage that it just isn't for them/isn't their style of game

Me personally I have owned my ps acc since ps3 days and I only have 1 plat and that's for this game

![gif](giphy|Vu2XkFoulwhMTEdb8D|downsized)
YES, good story, satisfying combat, exceptional art direction, sublime music and it just feels good to play, especially with some 3d headphones, but thats true for pretty much any game.
Absolutely
It’s ok. To me it felt like an Assassin’s Creed game and I hate that franchise with a passion.
It’s good. Personally I think it’s overrated and I still platniumed it. It’s a must-play.
Best PS4 game
Incredible the first time through. A slog the second time through. Get it on a decent sale. 8/10
Depends... would you like to play one of the best games ever made?
Personally, it's my favorite PS exclusive. I won't spoil anything but if your like me and love the Japanese samurai culture, you'll love this game!
No it’s terrible, just weeb garbage. No puzzles or anything. Drain dead fart of a game. 2/10
decent
lol this is like asking "hey guys, just in italy for the day, is the Sisten chapel worth it or nay?"  


Yes, of course it is, its the greatest game of all time
Its the best not just good
Hands down Best game I’ve played. I’ve played many games that might be close to it. And you might not like feudal japan as much as I do. But can’t be wrong with jt the story is great gameplay is great (some things could be improved) characters are great, scenery is INCREDIBLE, it really was game of the year when it released. Officially lost all the awards to TLOU2 because you know “wokism/feminism/lgbtqiaxyz acceptance” had the later so overhyped.

Safe bet if you want to buy a new game. Also it’s on the PSN Extra list so you can save a bit more if you sub
G O A T
Worst game I’ve ever played
If you like history and action then yes, it has beautiful graphics and the story is a bit sad but the best ever.
It's an excellent experience. Samurai fan or not, it is truly worth.
It is horizon forbidden west tier imo so not that great compared to GOW/Elden Ring
Yes. Only reason not to play it is if you have open world fatigue and you want to do most of the stuff in the game.
Has some of the best combat I've ever played in a game and I'm a devil may cry video game snob
Yes and yes
If you enjoy that sort of thing, it's fun. The story is pretty good and you can go as deep on the optional side content as you want.
Feels more like Assassin’s Creed Japan. But I like AC so yes it’s good to me.
I had a good time. It may be repetitive but I was invested in the role play. It made wanting to save every villager a challenge.
I feel like this is a trick question.  Like is this a trap?    


Sarcasm aside, yes it is very good.  It is easily in my top 3 best playstation 4/5 games currently.  The story, game play, progression, all seem so well put together.  One of the Playstation GOATS easily.
There is hot spring in the game! 😅
Yes and yes.
It's in my all time top 5 games in my 36 years of life.

&#x200B;

Having said that, the hype is huge and for a good reason, but I think if you read these comments and go into it there's a slight chance you're let down in some areas because of how glowing the reviews are from everyone. I don't think any game could meet that hype. But if a game could, GoT certainly is the one that could do it. Play it!
It is a good game.
Yes, it's fantastic! One of my favorite games. My fiancée jokingly calls it "Japanese Assassin's Creed" but it's better than any of the Assassin's Creed games IMO.
Finally someone asking about this game
Honestly one of the best game i experienced in PS5. Only topped by Elden Ring
It's good, and it's 100% worth playing. It's beautiful, mindful, and tranquil but requires a balance of patience when in combat. 

It was one of the games I was most looking forward to playing, but in some ways it felt underwhelming also.
The combat is so goddamn satisfying, you become very skilled throughout the game and get many toys to play with.
Haven't finished,  but I recommend 😘👌
I just redownloaded it after about a year solely to replay the singleplayer because it was super fun and I’ve been craving a good singleplayer game recently. Definitely worth playing, I’m falling in love with it all over again with thid playthrough
Im actually playing it now for first time and its superb. Combat is not perfect but the world , Audio etc are stellar.
Is it good??? It’s AMAZING. Play it now!!!
Yes.  One of the few games I platinumed
Easy platinum
I'm playing and quite enjoying it right now after reading all the recommendations in this thread! Stunning is an understatement.
Yes, a thousand times yes. It’s such a good experience.
Funny, I was JUST thinking about replaying this game last night.
I have the plats on both ps4 and ps5 versions.
This game is absolutely worth playing.
Combat is amazing, exploration is peak.
Late gen ps4 god tier title along with pt 2.
One of the absolute best PlayStation exclusives imo!
Yes and yes.

Also,

![gif](giphy|MNmyTin5qt5LSXirxd)
You’re asking this on the PlayStation sub lol
Yes, it's one the best games ever made.
Absolutely. One of the best Playstation 4/5 games thus far
Best game I've played in a decade. It also managed to break my 5 year hiatus from multiplayer games.
Is it good? It is a visual masterpiece and combat is fun af!

Worth playing? Every second of your life
Came here to say this was also my first platinum
100% yes
Um… it’s a once in a lifetime experience. Like play it. Now lol
It ruined other games for me it was at good
It is fantastic. End of story.

And I don't typically like these type of open world mission based adventure games. I use Horizon Forbidden West as a drink coaster.
I don't know. I only play the tutorial and stop cause it is multiplayer and I don't have a friend to play with mostly cause I'm a solo player.
Absolutely
LOL
I guess OP doesn’t understand what a review is for a game that is about 4 years old now.
Yes! First game I played on PS5.
I've played more than 50 PS4 games and I enjoyed the combat feeling the most in Ghost of Tsushima. This is one of the game you have to play before you die. This game is unique, something fresh, different. I had the same impressions with Horizon Zero Dawn.
If you like Ubisoft formula, sure.. THough the world is very pretty .
Absolutely! Amazing game. Looks great, gameplay is awesome with nice variety but not too much, open world was to my liking (I'm kinda burned out on open world games).
Very
It's good and well-crafted game. 

Personally I did get exhausted by it same way I would with Ubisoft open world games. 

That said, it is way better than anything that Ubisoft does (besides Rayman Origins; where is Rayman Origins 3?!).

Worth getting especially on sale.
Yes and yes.
It’s honestly my 2nd favorite video game next to The Last of Us. The graphics, story and overall feel of the game is amazing. The combat is tough at first but once you get used to it it’s phenomenal. I’m playing at the hardest difficulty and not getting touched and it’s so satisfying. Not to mention the customizability of Jin is really neat.
Talk about low effort…

Is water wet?
Is that a joke?
It's fucking amazing.  That being said, I haven't even played ot on the ps5 yet.
Definitely worth it!! It was the first game I played that I found myself trying to help as many people (side missions) as I could.

Their stories and lives were just as interesting as the main story!!
Yes
Great game! GoT and Spider-Man are the only games I’ve gotten platinum trophies for
yes
Did I shit my pants as a kid?!
Absolutely fantastic game by all measures
I couldn't get into it. I like assassin's Creeds, farcrys and HZD, loved Days Gone, but GoT didn't do it for me. I found it predictable and boring. The fighting wasn't entertaining. The graphics were pretty, but large empty spaces. Everyone says there is so much to do, but the world is really only filled with 5 or 6 types of side mini quests, which get repetitive after the 3rd time. That would be a no from me.
New PlayStation 5 owner here I’ve found a lot of games that ppl recommend highly overrated and not very fun (GOW:Rag, TLOU1) etc… this has been the most surprising game for me. Absolutely love it I feel like it’s underrated in comparison to other ps exclusives. Beautiful game, story makes you want to continue playing, gameplay is actually engaging and fun great game mechanics. 10/10 for me. Play it. This game and Ratchet n Clank Rift apart are me two favorite games on PS5
Yes
It’s one of those games that created lasting memories for me, it’s beyond good
Yes
Do you like video games?
One of the most beautiful games I've ever played.  One of my all time favorite games and it's incredible on PS5.
It's ok. Writing is meh and gets repetitive
My opinion might not matter much…..but I haven’t used a PlayStation since the OG grey one. On a whim, I decided to retire my Xbox and purchase the ps5 about a month+ ago. Ghost was the first game I played for the ps5, and I must say. Out of maybe 500+ games on Xbox, with a gamer score over 350k, GOT is hands my absolute favorite game I’ve played in such a long time. 

The story, the visuals, the controls when in combat are some of the most fluid and snappy fighting mechanics. Even the waypoint as a breeze of wind to follow just adds so much to this already stunning game. 

Buy it. Learn the combat system, and you will fall in love as well.
Favorite game. Best ever
Slow Start , awesome ending
Yes
On ps5, the wind alone is worth it. (Navigation)
Yes and yes
Great game, I recently got the play.  The story, and particularly the final act, really hit me in the feels.  The world is gorgeous, but some of the gameplay is somewhat cookie cutter.  Getting the platinum it really shows it’s troll face since you have to do and collect almost everything.  Still an 8.5 for me, and a proud platinum
Only got about a quarter of the story but it was pretty fun i kinda dropped it and picked up on gow2018
So I heard the game did so well Japan bought all copies for a short time and they represented Japan's history well enough they made the sucker punch devs ambassadors of the island of tsushima.
Also it is really good you can see the influence of sly cooper and infamous. I agree it's what assassins creed used to be good history stealth game
I only just started act 2 and I can confidently say it’s worth every penny
100%
Yes.
Yes it’s fucking fantastic
A must own
Checked out legends mode after so long (rocked on as Samurai, then Ronin, then Hunter). its ok, least co op even one pvp mode.
    As Single player - a must have. enjoy 100% if aim too :). Don't forget Ikki island too.  
Just BEGAN new game plus...
It was fulfilling finally getting redemption for your honor & family's honor. Basically 

*the slow knife* analogy. While the big bad is reeking havoc & occupying places you're slowly sharpening your yourself mentally & physically & even some trickery to get the edge in combat or drive fear into their hearts.

Definitely a must play. & the *show downs*? 

Movie magic. Perfect.
It’s phenomenal and I have very few gripes with the game—mainly that the side stuff gets a bit repetitive if you go for platinum (so many fox dens). Gameplay feels great (especially if you’re on ps5), story is great, and just about any moment in the game is wallpaper worthy because it’s so beautiful. Highly recommend
Yes
Definitely
Definitely
Yes
I enjoyed it, but it does get a bit repetitive. Definitely worth playing though!
This was my first real PS5 experience that sucked me in. It is great all around and on my short list of top PS5 games. The skills and gear, plus the overall background sound and art direction - it is really beautiful and feels deep in the ways that Hogwarts missed.

Elden ring - GoT - death stranding -deathloop - returnal - Hogwarts legacy - GT7 (for psvr2), mw2
I'm way in the minority, but I really didn't like it and dropped it after 8 or so hours. It has great presentation and really satisfying combat, but the general structure of the game is the most cookie cutter open world mission design. You go to a point, follow an NPC and listen to them talk, then fight some enemies, rinse, repeat. I also found the characters and story very underwhelming. I understand that this is not a popular opinion, but I really didn't enjoy the game. You should obviously play it for yourself and come to your own conclusion, but that's just my two cents.
I’m definitely part of the minority when I say I got bored with it. I got about a third into Act II and I stopped playing. HOWEVER, I am in no way saying that this is a bad game in fact it’s the opposite. GoT is incredible visually, narratively, and mechanically. It is a must play, it’s at least a must try. 

It just wasn’t my cup of tea at the time, I’m sure at some point I’ll revisit and actually finish the game. Then I’ll be one of those guys that rushes to the internet to say I was wrong about the game all along. I’ll probably end up fanboying about it in a year by the time no one is talking about it too much anymore. 

I can’t even explain why I got bored, I think it’s because it’s just now what I truly wanted to be playing at the time. I had just finished Mass Effect 1 for the first time when I started playing GoT. I really wanted to jump into ME2 but didn’t want to become burnt out so I decided to play something else in between. Turns out that’s not what my heart wanted because I’m too obsessed with Mass Effect right now. I’ve been playing the second one for about a week or so now. 

Anyway idk why I’m still rambling. In short YES you should absolutely try the game it’s absolutely awesome! The fact that I got bored says nothing basically. I enjoyed what I played, it was just a combination of being a little burnt out because admittedly the game is a bit of a slog (please don’t roast me too bad for saying that) and the fact that I wanted to be playing something else. 

Im gonna stfu I’ve already gone on too long. 🤣
Great game storywise, but I'm gonna be real - the side quests had no meat to me. I completely skipped em and powered through the main quest which I enjoyed much more. It was very predictable though if I'm being honest.

Combat was good but I wish it wasn't so Rock-Paper-Scissors with the stances. Them just being better against a certain enemy type instead of just being different moves kinda killed the enjoyment I got out of em.

Literally the most beautiful game I've ever played though. Not just for the realism, but more how they had their own style to that realism too. Extremely beautiful game, and nothing besides a From soft game has gotten me to stare at the environment like Ghost.
It has free destiny style multiplayer that is top teir with no micro transactions. Its amazing.
Yes amazing game, and an incredibly easy plat. Basically just beat the game and you get platinum.
It’s such a good game. In concept it’s pretty basic and has been compared to assassins creed but sucker punch knocked it out of the park. Great story, gameplay, visuals and if you’re into trophy hunting it’s a fairly easy platinum trophy to get compared to other games. It was my first platinum.
Repetitive, but beautiful
Yes. By all means play it, it’s simply amazing. Gameplay, graphics, art.
100%. Go for it
It is worth it and has replay value. Try it out.
It is a top 5 game for me.
Hell yeah.
Don't even consider playing it, as you asked about it, it instantly makes it not worth it.

🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃
Yes
It’s one of the games ever made
Save your money and play Control instead
It's a fantastic game. Definitely a must-play exclusive imo
Take it this way. I’ve had my playstation for 8 years now, and this is the only game I have loved enough to get the platinum in. I highly suggest the directors cut, since the Iki Island DLC is, although short, insanely fun. Its a beautiful game.
One of the few must-play games on the PS5. Might not be for everyone, but most people should live it. It has a banger of a multiplayer game too that came free with it. If it is still active. I spent 60 hours on that alone.
My favorite game I’ve ever played by a fiat margin. Story telling is amazing, looks great, plays great, has the best combat in any game I’ve ever played by far
top 5 ps4 game
my god yes
Ghost of Tsushima is one of the best games I’ve ever played, purchased a ps4 pro just to play it back when it came out!
Yes and yes
Yes
Easy Question, it’s good
If you own a PlayStation this game is a must. It’s absolutely beautiful with engaging combat and intriguing story.
Yes and yes
It’s great and one of the best games I’ve ever played in my life
First story game i actually finished and got 100% in a long time.
I finished it. It is worth playing for the atmosphere alone. But i'm not a fan of the combat system it's the same as in old assassins creed, arkham series and spiderman. Attack, perry and disrupt.
Game is a damn masterpiece
Fun game got bored near the end never killed the “guy”(don’t want to say

Looks beautiful felt I was doing the same shit go here kill these guys sneak rinse and repeat
Absofuckinglutely. This game is easily in my top five of all time. From gameplay to story line it’s a fucking masterpiece. I’m in a transition period (just platinumed HFW) and popped back into this in a hotel during a move and god damn… it’s so so so good.


I platinum trophies that game like half a year ago and I still think about it wishing that the current game I was playing was Ghost of Tsushima. I have never respected a game developer over their game more than this one
Only PS exclusive that you can bathe in game, easily 11/10
the first time i turned it on, i was in love. it looks gorgeous, plays wonderfully, and the story is amazing. it's the game i recommend first to anyone i know getting a ps console
A must play. Fantastic.
Oh yeah, big time
Yeah I got it coz the Director’s Cut came out at the same time as I got my PS5. Just saw some ads, said “oh cool a samurai game” and thought the visuals were nice so I bought it. Boy was I in for a surprise. The opening segment had me on the edge of my seat. Playing it in Japanese gives off a strong role-playing satisfaction. The combat system plus bloody graphics is super enjoyable. 

Downsides are the stealth game seems broken and the side activities, compared to other open worlds, can get quite repetitive. 

Overall, a wonderful game I would recommend to all.
Is having a positive emotional growth good - playing one of the most beautiful and well made videogame - worth living?
Me: Hell The F♤ck Yeah.
Can we add a flair for questions like this and then also add the ability to filter them so we can choose not to see them?
It's beautiful
Crazy idea here… just look it up? Google? YouTube? Bing? Edge? Twitch? Anything? Just look it up, look up reviews that are already made, look up spoiler free gameplay videos… why is this such an issue on Reddit
Yes
One of the best games currently on PS5
Amazing game and great DLC too
I don’t know what kind of rock you been living under but everyone has heard about how great this game is
Metacritic?!!!
First ever game for me to platinum. It’s a game that would make you wanna stay and keep playing, you don’t want it to end at all.
No, go another sub/r to ask is their game is worth playing, everyone will say no
Yes, definitely. The best samurai game out in my opinion, and a very fun world to explore. It doesn't really overstay its welcome either!
100% yes!!
Yes.
Probably the best exclusive game on PS5. Better than God of War
Absolutely!!!
Yes
It's a great game
It's a bit too long if you are a completionist, but you can also have fun with it.
I used to do a haiku and take a bath after every big fight, so you can also have fun and really immerse yourself in it's atmosphere 😅😅😅
The thing for me is it really just takes a while to finish everything it has to offer and when you have a family and you work games like this can be overwhelming. I never finished it but it’s amazingly gorgeous nonetheless.
Oh yes! It‘s totally worth it. Give it a try and you will see :)
One of the best games, flat out. A must for any playstation owner 👌
Definitely worth playing but it can get repetitive, it’s basically a much better assassins creed and it’s absolutely gorgeous.
Yes! Great game. If you're looking for a great story and a good looking game it's great.
One of my Top three games on PS.

100% recommend it. Then again I am biased. I'm not so much a weeb as such, but I do have a deep rooted interest in Japanese culture.
give it a try
Weird question
If you enjoy the Japanese Arts and History and a good real time action strategy with decision making on how to take out or ambush your opponent. I would say yes. 

I haven’t bought the PS5 upgrade, but playing off the base PS4 I would 100% recommend you add at it to your game catalog. It looks great from screen play I’ve seen for the PS5 & with the Directors cut coming w/ the included DLC, Iki island expansion. 

Only reason I haven’t bought it is because personally I don’t like to buy a game that I already own on one platform for another. Unless I’ve lost/damaged it or sold it off. But I’m still tempted to buy the PS5 upgrade.
I didn’t play it until last November, thinking previously that it didn’t look good, quite boring etc.. then I played it and was blown away. I was pissed at myself for not playing it earlier
Yes
Yes it has a great story and visuals
Yeah it's worth the time and money. I love the samurai power fantasy that you get playing, and the world looks so beautiful. It's one of the few games that I platinum'd.
Is water wet?
Can anyone tell me if it’s worth a buy if I’ve never been interested in any sort of Asian history? From what I’ve seen, it’d be an excruciating play through for someone like me who isn’t into samurai, Japanese history, etc. What are your thoughts?
Damn straight it's good, hell it's beyond good it's a certified Masterpiece of a game
Couldn’t say it better. Also my first plat on the PS5
It's the reason I bought a PS5! Looking forward to getting the platinum.
Damn, apparently I have to replay it. I got bored and turned it off. It’s a beautiful game, but just felt slow and drawn out.
    If you do decide to try it out again, may I recommend using Japanese dialogue with subtitles? I’ve always preferred dubs over subs when it comes to all media, I know I’m not right in the head, but for this game it genuinely adds to the immersion. I’ve heard great things about the English voice actor for the main character but playing it with Japanese dialogue made it so badass.
        I played on Hard on first playthrough (English)
Then on new game plus i played on Lethal (Japanese Audio with Samurai Cinema)
            I gotta do it samurai cinema style one day
        Based off everyone’s comments I have to give it another stab. 

I would bet most people probably prefer Dubs over Subs. I prefer Subs; makes it more realistic. That’s how I do all my movies, too. I’m convinced that if Prey, the most recent Predator movie, would have used the language of the native it would have been better. 

I regress, I played it with Japanese Dialogue, and you’re right, it was completely immersive. But, yeah, I’m convinced by the Handsome folks here that I should play it again.
        I played on Hard on first playthrough (English)

        Don’t the subs distract?  I guess in battle you’re reading npcs
            Yea in combat I’m not really paying attention to the subs. Mainly during cut scenes or when you have a companion that’s giving you instructions during breaks in between combat.
    Not every game is for everyone, I totally get that. I do recommend you re-visit it though! It's a genuinely good game that I couldn't put down once I got into it.
    First half yes, second half is much better and even the side quests get better
    I did that first 2 times I played it now on my way to Main story and New game plus plat
    I felt the same way about it once I got to act 2 of the game.Took like a month break off from it and got through the game. The combat was great, but story and side missions needs work.  Maybe act 2 was drag on a lil too far. Thank God, I have the ps5 directors cut version. I felt like the dlc side of the game (iki island) was better.
This
Haven’t no life’s a game the way I did GoT in a bit. Luckily I was off work and just played 3 days from wake until sleep only stopping to eat 😂
    I’m a Registered Nurse and gaming keeps my head cool lol. I’m about to have 12 days off straight I cannot wait to continue this game and a bunch of others
Gameplay mechanics is so top notch. The game is a gamers game not a bunch of cut scenes etc.
Top 1 in open world games for me.
Same!
I loved this game. I didn’t get to it until last year, but it’s one of very few platinums that I have gotten that I wish there was still more to do. Most games (looking at you Hogwarts Legacy) have worn out their welcome by the time I get to the platinum. I am seriously considering playing it all again on ps4. I can’t wait for the sequel.
What are your 2 top games
What are you top 10 games, I need inspiration for games to play.
    Death stranding is a great, chill game when burning the devils lettuce.
        Downloading as I've just had some sweet butterleaf lettuce. Cheers cobba
        I appreciate the love for death stranding, and the brand new sentence
        I find death stranding to be the most boring game with the most interesting story ever. I want to play the game just to know the story but man the gameplay is extremely boring to me.
    Outer Wilds, God of War, Ghost of Tsushima, Asura's Wrath, Everhood, SuperHOT, and Metal Gear Rising Revengeance are games I love off the top of my head.
        Literally downloaded Tsushima because of this comment. You got taste kid.
        Outer Wilds is a masterpiece
        I like that you aren't even the person who said the thing about GoY being a top 3 game but you decided to rattle off your favorite games without context. Thats not weird.
    1. Horizon Forbidden West (play the prequel Horizon Zero Dawn to understand the story)

2. The Uncharted series

3. The Tomb Raider series

4. Ratchet and Clank

5. Control

6. Infamous Second Son
        Horizon Zero Dawn is the 1st one. Forbidden West is the sequel.

All nice choices anyway, not played Control yet but I've heard good things. What's it like?
            Thanks, corrected. First off - I recommend you play it on a PS5 because I faced frame rate drops, slight texture load delays, and a noticeable pause after I returned to the game from the menu on my PS4 Pro.

Nothing game breaking, but still.

And Control makes you feel like a bad ass. I'd compare it to what I finished most recently - Infamous Second Son. 

You've got superpowers like Delsin Rowe, but there's a heavier plot, creepier enemies, and the building in which the game takes place in is sprawling, brutalist, and weird.

Once you've mastered the combat, you can dispatch enemies with ease, and even then it's thrilling.

It's a fucking fun game!

It will probably be a while before I get a PS5 but I'm glad I'm eligible for a free upgrade since I bought a physical copy for my PS4.
                It's not a prequel either haha don't worry, I know what you mean ;) Just thought I'd let you know, a prequel is something that comes after the original but takes place before it.

And I can imagine, it's a big game. Unfortunately I'm in the same boat as you as I don't have a PS5 yet either but I have a physical copy of it too so I guess I could wait. Plenty of other great games in the meantime. Although, I did play the beginning of Forbidden West and completed the whole tutorial area and I didn't notice anything too bad performance-wise but I bet the game gets more intense once the map starts opening up and everything else. Poor PS4 will sound like a hairdryer on full blast, you know how it is haha

Love inFamous, I remember I used to have the first one with Cole and the electric powers when I was a kid. Such a cool game, Second Son was sick the way you could have 4 powers and all the special attacks once you build your Karma up. Choosing between good and bad for different powers and changes in the story. First Light was cool too playing as Fetch (was that her name?) the girl with the neon powers and the map is nice too, rainy Seattle, also home to my favourite bands, Alice in Chains and Soundgarden to name a couple. Got the platinum for that game. Good times.

Control sounds like my type of thing then, I prefer a darker tone. I should definitely get around to it one day.
            Coming here a year later to say if you havent played control to play control lol. 

Game got me HOOKED on everything Remedy and even SCP-universe related. I've never been more invested in the universe of a series than the control / alan wake "remedyverse" - and control 2 is one of my most anticipated games in, well, ever. I havent really been "excited" for a game in, I dunno, 10+ years?

The deep-rooted and wild universe/story it throws you into is worth so much more than any gameplay IMO. I read wiki articles on the game's lore. WIKI ARTICLES. Lmao. Only ever game to send me to the Wiki for entertainment was the dark soul's series
    If you are looking for PlayStation games: red dead 2, the last of us 1 & 2, Both God of Wars, Hollow Knight, Titanfall 2, bloodborne, dishonored 2, returnal, outer wilds, Horizon games, and yes Ghost of Tsushima
I haven’t like ac since black flag and that was 10 years ago but I love GoT
    I just said this the other day. Assassins creed walked to GoT could run.
I liked Assassin's Creed but I didn't love Ghost of Tsushima. P.S. I played Assassin's Creed from the first one until Unity.
    Lol You got off the train at the perfect time.
        Unity was great
            Agreed. But it was awful on release. o i put it down and played it 2 years later to thoroughly enjoy it.
So true. It’s assassin’s creed with a fear meter and samurai dueling.
    Much more. With different stances, with different utilities it's much better plus hose main side stories were great and well created.
Yea it was nicely balanced. Enemies get harder the further you get. But your stick skills improve a ton over time and the ninja weapons you unlock along the way integrate so seamlessly into combat.
Couldn’t agree more. This is a spot on description of GoT.
I have the same opinion on GoT with regards to the side quests. and unfortunately, I did not stick through it. Its just that they lack the back stories, which may have contributed to the feeling of repetitiveness.

But in terms of combat, presentation and fluidity of movements, etc, its up there.
Agree.
People seems to love the gameplay but the fights are more or less always the same. Chose correct stance for enemy type and parry.
Facts. 

I’ve always felt like I was on an island when I said it was a solid C of a game. Passing grade but nothing that I would call great with probably the most predictable main story line in recent years.
    Games rarely have good stories anyway imo.

People praise Plauge tale, and by the end of the second game, I wanted to blow my brains out. Wasn't even inherently bad. I just felt like I got beat over the head with bad plot for no reason.

Tsushima, while predictable, told a story that was drcent. Which is more than most games can say recently besides a select few. It's rare now a days for a studio to put a compelling story blended with actual fun gameplay.
        The way you felt with Plague Tale (I haven’t played either game, but they’re on my list) is how I felt with Tsushima, only I didn’t get through an entire game before deciding I wanted to go to the hardware store to buy 12 ft of rope and a three-legged stool. 

Didn’t help the fact that I played the game as a perfect samurai with no stealth (other than when the game forced me to on a few missions) so the ending felt 100% at odds with how I actually played the game. It could’ve really used a meter similar to RDR2 that had branching implications later on. That’s far from original but it would be a vast improvement on what we got. But why do that when you can just copy and paste the 48th fox shrine on the map? 

Horizon Zero Dawn has a better story. God of War has a better story. I didn’t love Ragnarok or Forbidden West but the main line stories are better than GoT. LoU 1 and 2 are both better. Spiderman is probably equally predictable entirely due to character familiarity, but Miles Morales had a better story. And those are just PS first party games.
You're right that it's very acclaimed, but there are definitely people that don't like it. Personally I couldn't stand it. Definitely in the minority there though.
Right! It's been out long enough to know if it's truly a good game without asking internet strangers. Opencritic, Metacritic , YouTube..  there are so many ways to see if a game is good with legitimate thought out answers and reviews , but apparently asking reddit is easier ?
    Sometimes it's nice to hear from random people who are not critics, YouTube is good but it's blocked on my devices for good reason. Let a brother ask reddit.
But games are expensive and I finish them too fast so I need to if they are good before I buy them.
    Understandable! I usually watch a quick bit of gameplay or, there’s a guy on youtube who does “before you buy” videos for a lot of really popular games and does pretty good (relatively spoiler free) reviews that go into gameplay, balance, story, progression, etc. I can try and find his channel if you’re interested
        I would be very happy if you try to find his channel for me.
            [this is his review of the ghost of tsushima director’s cut](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kbSozPzaNlA) but it sounds like he focuses more on the new addional content in that area as opposed to the base game. He does have a review for the base game as well on his channel
                Thanks!
    thats totally understandable :) i run through games too fast sometimes too. 

i always put them on hard from the jump now and try to complete as much as i can to get my moneys worth.  The game is actually pretty good. get the bundle that comes with the dlc. i hope you enjoy it!
    If you have PS plus extra you can get GoT and the expansion for free
I agree. Was let down by the repetitiveness of it. Seemed like it was dragged out and clearing out bases was the same as story missions. Shouldn't have to play it on hardest difficulty to feel like I'm not a god.
Same. Started strong. Got bored quickly and abandoned
    As much as I hate to say it, also same. You can pet foxes tho and that's a plus.

I definitely don't think it's a bad game though
Agree with this - gorgeous in terms of both graphics and art style, but game play, story and characters will not live up to the ridiculously high praise this game gets. I’d recommend getting it but people really need to cool it on giving people ridiculously high expectations
Story definitely is boring, but gameplay isn't is like you say.

It's fun and even tense and challenging if you play on harder difficulties.

Also the stealth is pretty fun, like a next generation Assassin's Creed
    youre both wrong.
        ok dad :c
            exactly
Why did this get downvoted lol? He has a different opinion, get him.
As Single player - a must have. enjoy 100% if aim too :). Don't forget Ikki island too.

Love inFamous, I remember I used to have the first one with Cole and the electric powers when I was a kid. Such a cool game, Second Son was sick the way you could have 4 powers and all the special attacks once you build your Karma up. Choosing between good and bad for different powers and changes in the story. First Light was cool too playing as Fetch (was that her name?) the girl with the neon powers and the map is nice too, rainy Seattle, also home to my favourite bands, Alice in Chains and Soundgarden to name a couple. Got the platinum for that game. Good times.

Control sounds like my type of thing then, I prefer a darker tone. I should definitely get around to it one day.
        Coming here a year later to say if you havent played control to play control lol. 

Game got me HOOKED on everything Remedy and even SCP-universe related. I've never been more invested in the universe of a series than the control / alan wake "remedyverse" - and control 2 is one of my most anticipated games in, well, ever. I havent really been "excited" for a game in, I dunno, 10+ years?

The deep-rooted and wild universe/story it throws you into is worth so much more than any gameplay IMO. I read wiki articles on the game's lore. WIKI ARTICLES. Lmao. Only ever game to send me to the Wiki for entertainment was the dark soul's series
If you are looking for PlayStation games: red dead 2, the last of us 1 & 2, Both God of Wars, Hollow Knight, Titanfall 2, bloodborne, dishonored 2, returnal, outer wilds, Horizon games, and yes Ghost of Tsushima
I just said this the other day. Assassins creed walked to GoT could run.
Lol You got off the train at the perfect time.
    Unity was great
        Agreed. But it was awful on release. o i put it down and played it 2 years later to thoroughly enjoy it.
Much more. With different stances, with different utilities it's much better plus hose main side stories were great and well created.
Games rarely have good stories anyway imo.

People praise Plauge tale, and by the end of the second game, I wanted to blow my brains out. Wasn't even inherently bad. I just felt like I got beat over the head with bad plot for no reason.

Tsushima, while predictable, told a story that was drcent. Which is more than most games can say recently besides a select few. It's rare now a days for a studio to put a compelling story blended with actual fun gameplay.
    The way you felt with Plague Tale (I haven’t played either game, but they’re on my list) is how I felt with Tsushima, only I didn’t get through an entire game before deciding I wanted to go to the hardware store to buy 12 ft of rope and a three-legged stool. 

Didn’t help the fact that I played the game as a perfect samurai with no stealth (other than when the game forced me to on a few missions) so the ending felt 100% at odds with how I actually played the game. It could’ve really used a meter similar to RDR2 that had branching implications later on. That’s far from original but it would be a vast improvement on what we got. But why do that when you can just copy and paste the 48th fox shrine on the map? 

Horizon Zero Dawn has a better story. God of War has a better story. I didn’t love Ragnarok or Forbidden West but the main line stories are better than GoT. LoU 1 and 2 are both better. Spiderman is probably equally predictable entirely due to character familiarity, but Miles Morales had a better story. And those are just PS first party games.
Sometimes it's nice to hear from random people who are not critics, YouTube is good but it's blocked on my devices for good reason. Let a brother ask reddit.
Understandable! I usually watch a quick bit of gameplay or, there’s a guy on youtube who does “before you buy” videos for a lot of really popular games and does pretty good (relatively spoiler free) reviews that go into gameplay, balance, story, progression, etc. I can try and find his channel if you’re interested
    I would be very happy if you try to find his channel for me.
        [this is his review of the ghost of tsushima director’s cut](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kbSozPzaNlA) but it sounds like he focuses more on the new addional content in that area as opposed to the base game. He does have a review for the base game as well on his channel
            Thanks!
thats totally understandable :) i run through games too fast sometimes too. 

i always put them on hard from the jump now and try to complete as much as i can to get my moneys worth.  The game is actually pretty good. get the bundle that comes with the dlc. i hope you enjoy it!
If you have PS plus extra you can get GoT and the expansion for free
As much as I hate to say it, also same. You can pet foxes tho and that's a plus.

I definitely don't think it's a bad game though
youre both wrong.
    ok dad :c
        exactly
I played on Hard on first playthrough (English)
Then on new game plus i played on Lethal (Japanese Audio with Samurai Cinema)
    I gotta do it samurai cinema style one day
Based off everyone’s comments I have to give it another stab. 

I would bet most people probably prefer Dubs over Subs. I prefer Subs; makes it more realistic. That’s how I do all my movies, too. I’m convinced that if Prey, the most recent Predator movie, would have used the language of the native it would have been better. 

I regress, I played it with Japanese Dialogue, and you’re right, it was completely immersive. But, yeah, I’m convinced by the Handsome folks here that I should play it again.

Don’t the subs distract?  I guess in battle you’re reading npcs
    Yea in combat I’m not really paying attention to the subs. Mainly during cut scenes or when you have a companion that’s giving you instructions during breaks in between combat.
Downloading as I've just had some sweet butterleaf lettuce. Cheers cobba
I appreciate the love for death stranding, and the brand new sentence
I find death stranding to be the most boring game with the most interesting story ever. I want to play the game just to know the story but man the gameplay is extremely boring to me.
Literally downloaded Tsushima because of this comment. You got taste kid.
Outer Wilds is a masterpiece
I like that you aren't even the person who said the thing about GoY being a top 3 game but you decided to rattle off your favorite games without context. Thats not weird.
Horizon Zero Dawn is the 1st one. Forbidden West is the sequel.

All nice choices anyway, not played Control yet but I've heard good things. What's it like?
    Thanks, corrected. First off - I recommend you play it on a PS5 because I faced frame rate drops, slight texture load delays, and a noticeable pause after I returned to the game from the menu on my PS4 Pro.

Nothing game breaking, but still.

And Control makes you feel like a bad ass. I'd compare it to what I finished most recently - Infamous Second Son. 

You've got superpowers like Delsin Rowe, but there's a heavier plot, creepier enemies, and the building in which the game takes place in is sprawling, brutalist, and weird.

Once you've mastered the combat, you can dispatch enemies with ease, and even then it's thrilling.

It's a fucking fun game!

It will probably be a while before I get a PS5 but I'm glad I'm eligible for a free upgrade since I bought a physical copy for my PS4.
        It's not a prequel either haha don't worry, I know what you mean ;) Just thought I'd let you know, a prequel is something that comes after the original but takes place before it.

And I can imagine, it's a big game. Unfortunately I'm in the same boat as you as I don't have a PS5 yet either but I have a physical copy of it too so I guess I could wait. Plenty of other great games in the meantime. Although, I did play the beginning of Forbidden West and completed the whole tutorial area and I didn't notice anything too bad performance-wise but I bet the game gets more intense once the map starts opening up and everything else. Poor PS4 will sound like a hairdryer on full blast, you know how it is haha

Love inFamous, I remember I used to have the first one with Cole and the electric powers when I was a kid.
