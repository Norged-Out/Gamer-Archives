[[What stance did all of you first max out]]


Here‚Äôs some Photo Mode pictures as well


Water stance because getting shield bashed pissed me off.

EDIT: Corrected stance type.
    Water stance is the one for shield guys
    I played through on lethal, and this stance by far has the most use overall. On top of the majority of enemies having a shield, the triangle charge attack is just so viable for all enemies in general.
        I‚Äôm pretty sure you can use it on the big guys with the shields too even though I think moon stance is still more effective.
            The big guys with the heavy shields are* situational, Ive found. Even with moon stance, they don't always stagger. Sure, you could charm to guarantee a stagger, but in my experience, using a charm slot to gain this effect isn't worth it. So, moon stance and water stance both work equally well, I think. Just have to watch out for that counter attack more often than not.
                Yeah this game I‚Äôve found that being aggressive is almost completely unnecessary unless you need to go kill some archers. Counter attacking seems to be the best overall tactic.
                    Damn I for sure rush every enemy down with the appropriate stance. I counterattack when attacked but I‚Äôm doin everything in my power to overwhelm every single encounter.
                    Even with archers far away you can hold parry and literally never worry about getting hit
                        The fire archers are annoying to parry cause you get lit on fire after they drop
            I've actually found that the big shield guys go down easier when you use water. I think the game codes them as shield and not brute for stagger purposes, but I could be wrong, I only tried moon on them a couple times before switching back to water
            It can, and I think that was sort of the intention for some of the brutes earlier. They have shield, so it‚Äôs fair game.
        Forgot about the triangle charge attack.. I tend to forget some moves for a while until I go thru the skills and am like ‚Äúaahhhhh, that‚Äôs right!‚Äù lol
            I do this all the time. When I played GoW there was that kind of moment where I rediscovered a combo and then suddenly kicked some Valkyrie's ass
        Easily the best stance i agree
    Same, favorite overall too
    Not to mention it‚Äôs actually quite effective against other classes too, especially the charged up flurry of slashes.
    My main ‚Äòlegends‚Äô assassin just carries a water katana and I‚Äôm never sorry. Freed up the legendary slot for the magma bomb.
Water stance cuz I liked the rush attack, looks really cool
Stone stance because i like poking the enemy
    The pokes are unstoppable!!!

Water stance for that sick flurry, then wind stance to parry spear dudes automatically, then stone for the triple thrust and moon.
Wind cause I can‚Äôt perfect parry the spear attacks worth a damn
    I do find it humorous that spears and polearms are such a hassle that they require investing into two different skill trees to get the full effect for fighting/defending against them.

On a side note, can we all agree that the deflecting arrow perk was something we all bought ASAP?
        Playing through on lethal rn and my god the archers got to me. Arrow deflection was a must from the start
            Fittingly, archer Jin is also an insanely good build to use on lethal. But yeah, once you have that and the perks to parry unblockable attacks, L1 starts to feel like a childhood blanket with how safe it makes you feel.

Even on my first playthrough, which was on normal difficulty, I almost instinctively got deflect arrows as soon as I could (me being a history nerd knowing full well Mongols were insanely good horseback archers). It ended up saved me more times than I could ever hope to count.
        The part about buying arrow deflection immediately really resonated with me. One of the first things I buy each playthrough.
            Even before finding out how much of a problem they could be, I immediately brought it because, firstly, it‚Äôs just badass to be able to do that, and secondly, my thought process was: ‚Äú*So basically, it completely mitigates an entire enemy type? SIGN ME UP!*‚Äù

Heck, later on when freeing Shimura, Jin deflects one in a cutscene. It‚Äôs like the developers silently put in a message saying to get it if you haven‚Äôt already.
        Completed Tshushima and Iki on lethal. I am sure I deflected nary an arrow the entire time. I am trying to get every artifact and challenge so I‚Äôm not completely done. Just debating if I want the frustration of the arrow challenges because even with Tadayormi‚Äôs armor- I can‚Äôt seem to do it.
            The arrow challenges require a lot of practice and just the right charms. The dlc decided to pull a cheeky move because it is virtually impossible to get the best time on any of them at first, but the charm you get from the challenges (which also increases nocking speed) progressively gets better the more of the challenges you do and the better you do at them.

Meaning yes, the game basically decided to be insanely harsh in that regard. Trust me, Iki island has a lot of things that will make you feel like they were playing a bit dirty in some regards.
                Ahhhhhh. Makes sense. So I just need to complete one and the charms make it progressively easier. Got it!!!
                    The way I remember it, it is basically stairsteps: you have to do all of them once in under 15s and you‚Äôll have enough boost from your charm of precision that you should be able to do them all again, this time getting silver, and 6 more incremental increases to your charm. Finally you‚Äôre ready to go for gold which basically requires a perfect ‚Äúno misses‚Äù run on all of them and starting concentration as SOON as the game starts the timer.
    Same
    Lol I can see how that‚Äôs hard but I just practiced against them a lot and figured it out well enough. Works for me pretty often now
    And the kick is so fun to yeet enemies off cliffs
Wind because in lethal difficulty spears are my worst nightmares, genuinely died more to normal spear goonies than any boss in lethal. üåû
Much like others in this comment section, I maxed out water stance first. The flurry of blows is devastating, and I was enthralled with it the first time I used it. Shield dorks were also really annoying to begin with, so handling them was an additional bonus.
Honestly water was the most useful and aesthetically pleasing to pull off combos to me
    Facts
the moment I saw the instant kill after the kick on wind stance I just had to get it
Water Stance 100%‚Ä¶
water stance
Stone stance: Because I love how amazing the damage output of Momentum was if you got it off. Carried me through many a duel.
    I maxed stone first too, but I should‚Äôve done wind since the spearmen were demolishing me.
Well.. Stone because it was the first one. 

But Water is the undisputed champion outside of Moon cancel
Moon stance because of the triple spin
Definitely water stance. And then I started actively hunting shield pricks in every group of enemies. Sometimes I only killed the shield guys and went on my merry way‚Ä¶just so I could come back and clean them up again. Vengeance.
Stone so I could have more effectiveness in duels. I‚Äôm pretty sure most duels other than the occasional shield general or Khotun himself are sword-wielders
Mine was Wind because shield enemies were easy to take out for me with the flurry of slashes. It was the damn spearmen. My Lord, there was absolutely a pain.
You can upgrade stances?

        NO

Im certain the general consensus is to max wind stance last
    Wind was first. I love kicking enemies off of cliffs.
Stone stance, had the most down to earth and realistic passive stance and attacks, besides, the stabbing feels awesome
‚àÜ...
‚àÜ‚àÜ‚àÜ‚àÜ‚àÜ‚àÜ‚àÜ‚àÜ‚àÜ‚àÜ‚àÜ‚àÜ‚àÜ‚àÜ‚àÜ‚àÜ‚àÜ

Just for good measure
xD
Water stance cuz that flurry attack is sick
Stone stance, cause it‚Äôs good against all of the enemy types and feels like the ground zero basic stance. I think i did water stance after that.
Stone given most enemies are sword based. 

But I admit, Water goated.
I saved up points and did them all at once üòÖ
Stone cause them duels was kicking my ass. The gadgets and ranged weapons kind of helped against the other enemy types. But the duels is mostly swords in the stone stance. Moving forward they gotta make switching stances more fluid or maybe a separate button input for opening guys up holding shields and spears.
Water just felt the most useful
I feel like I used water stance the most. From what I remember there were few and far between situations where water stance didn't work
Wind Stance
Coolest armor ever
    I love it
Water stance because it didn‚Äôt matter what was in front of me, after the flurry was over they were dead
Stone stance, because he holds his sword like Qui Gon
Idk I use a rng whenever I have skill points lol, it might‚Äôve been stone because it‚Äôs default
Water iirc, and it's the coolest looking imo
Wind for the kick.
Only used stone stance my entire play through because I was too lazy to learn and level up the other stances üòÖ
wind stance since your kick can 1 hit any enemy and it looks and flows well into the ghost stance
Water stance immediately. That combo is unforgivable against anyone with a shield, especially the Kahn.
Wind stance. The typhoon kick carried me in yarikawa.
The one with the shield
I‚Äôm try to max out water first cause it‚Äôs the one I use the most
I like Wind Stance bc it just looks cooler than the others. Water Stance is just such a perfect counter to shields if you're struggling into them. Stone Stance stab finisher is very satisfying. Hardly ever use Moon Stance bc it looks dumb imo but then I get salty when a brute kills me.
whichever one counters spears, i played on lethal and good lord nothing was as irritating as those instant attacks from spearmen. for some reason i could never get the parrying down for them
Water because, be water my friend
I only maxed out the antishield stance because it's just longer combo, the other ones were adding some hand holding like making you attack faster or auto parrying the mot challenging fighter...making him a joke.
Moon stance.
Stone üóø
Water hurts everyone. Others can't get hits. Weaker but barley noticable when you spam
The first stance cuz I love triple poking enemies
First one i think
Bro needs to learn how to take pics through PlayStation üò≠üôè
Might be a psychopath here, but I upgraded each stance level by level.
Standard Butterfly, originally innovated by Glenn Hall of the Chicago Blackhawks in the early 1960s and made famous by Ken Dryden and perfected by Patrick Roy, and is now the most common goaltending stance in the NHL today....

![gif](giphy|3o84TQJ4ZAgt8NbvHy|downsized)
It was so long ago I can‚Äôt remember the name of the stance, I maxed the one that let you do the big kicküòÇ
wind fs the kick knockdown is insane
Water charged heavy made me feel like isshin
Water
Stone it was the starter
I just saved enough points to do a whole row(horizontal) and was fair across the board....So same time ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Stone for me, idk why
The first one
Stone........
I maxed Wind stance (spears) because none of the techniques required me to memorize a particular set of buttons to push. However I use Water stance (shields) most often.
I went by left to right row with all 4 of them so I finished all 4 in the same minute
Water stance. Felt the most generally useful.
Water Stance
Stone
Wind stance to level 3, Water stance maxxed

Got shitted off by spears, and the massive damages capable by the water stance intrigued me

Nowadays, 8 or so 100%s down, i just max all 4 at the same time
Patient stance. Waiting for it to come out on pc
![gif](giphy|xsX60Ii4lSujPa62Yz|downsized)

My b-boy stance
Every time I play, I max them all out at the same time
Stone because it's the first one LOL. But my fav is water out of them all
water stance, cause I didn't read how they worked so I used the water stance for all enemy types up until Act 2 when I read how the stances worked
None of them, I was to lazy to bother switching stances, although I think I was on stone stance to be specific, probably maxed that one out I don‚Äôt really remember
I think stone, I can't remember too much
Water all da way bay beeeee
Wind. *kick*
Stone. Most of the boss fights are sword users. It helps so much to have a quick, hard-hitting punish.

Second was Water, that rapid strike is too good to pass up for long.
Earned all the points before upgrading anything, when I had reasonably enough, I upgraded them all at once lmao
Water! It's easily my most used even against the wrong enemies
Stone stance
Water fs so powerful and quick but then stone shortly after for duels
Water stance, i love flurry strike and hate shieldmen.
stone cause idk
Water, speed go brrrrr
Water stance charged attack is one of the coolest in the game
Wind stance because that kick will stagger almost anyone and knock em down for some good damage
Water because shielded enemies are unbearable without it

After that, wind because you can one shot kick sword and spear enemies and finish them off on the ground, and it is so much fun to use
I went in order
I maxed Stone Stance first & never switched from it. Playing the whole game with the starter stance is doable, & actually more enjoyable I find. Playing at a disadvantage against special enemies makes the fact that they're special enemies more meaningful.
Wind stance so that I could stunt on the spear guys, but the difference in timing was slim
You can go through the whole game with water stance only, so the wet stance for me
Wind, not because parry but because its funny to kick guys off of cliffs
And then water stance after that
I used stone sword
Water
Water for shield bitches, then wind for auto-parry (insanely useful on lethal)
Wind because imo it‚Äôs the best looks the coolest and I literally never stopped using it
I maxed out wind stance first in campaign as spearmen are the most troublesome,you can handle shields,brutes and swords just fine with wind stance if you get used to timing and even no upgraded moon stance is more then ample when paired with maxed wind stance against everything.
Water stance because you can hold triangle and tap tap triangle for easy shield brake
Water stance because the flurry of attacks was really fun to use also fuck shieldbearers
Watter
Water stance is the one for shield guys
