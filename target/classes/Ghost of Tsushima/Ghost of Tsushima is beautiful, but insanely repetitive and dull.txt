[[Ghost of Tsushima is beautiful, but insanely repetitive and dull]]


I don't hate GoT. I'm just very disappointed. I'll start of with the things I actually liked about the game.

Obviously the game looks stunning, as most of these reviews are quick to point out. And having the guiding wind to help you to your objectives is a very nice touch and really innovative way to get rid of quest markers.

The mythical tales are excellent, and so are the duels that come with the quests. This is were the game really shines, as it is able to combine the best of the great visuals and good combat into memorable segments.

Regular combat when it flows is also good. Switching between stances as you kill 3 guys quickly, shooting the next 2 guys with an arrow as they charge towards you, before throwing a sticky bomb against the next horde of Mongols waiting in line. The stand off mechanic is also a cool way to start battles.

The problem is that it all gets repetitive very quickly. There are only 5 enemies the entire game. There's sword guy, sword and shield guy, spear guy, big guy and archer. Their apperance changes sligthly throughout the game, but nothing else does. It's all about equipping the correct stance (which you're kind of forced to) and then spamming the attack button. The lack of enemy variety combined with the quests being very similar is my biggest issue with the game.

You can play stealthy instead, and a lot of the time the game forces you to. The problem is that the stealth mechanics aren't that great, and nobody likes insta fail stealth missions. And I haven't even mentioned the numerous tailing missions, which I thought game developers had buried in a chest and thrown away all the keys. Because they truly suck in this game too. 

The generic side quests are mostly stinkers. "Help! My family is attacked by bandits/Mongols". Go there, look for clues, follow footprints and fight some guys. At least I stopped doing them after the first 10-15 were all like that. The companion side quests are a lot better, but I feel like the longest ones (Norio, Masako and Ishikawa) could have been shortened a bit.

The story was kind of mediocre in my opinion, but I get why a lot of people liked it. My biggest problem was that Jin has the personality of a tissue paper. I get what they're trying to do with the story, but just because it's all about honor, doesn't mean the main character needs a stick up his \*\*\*\* the entire playthrough. Every time I thought we would get a glimpse of something else, it all came back to some trope about honor. And I know that the setting doesn't call for a cheery protagonist cracking jokes, but at least give me something. 

The side activities were another big disappointment. It's Ubisoft style question marks cluttered all over the map.  Enemy camps are a meme at this point, and they're mostly the same in GoT. They got too big towards the end of the game, and the unskippable cutscene every single time you freed another peasant was unbearable after a while. The same goes for the cutscene after clearing the camp.

Fox Dens are just there. You do them to fill your charm slots and then avoid them like the plague unless you're a completionist. Hot springs and bamboo strikes are fine. Just stuff you find and do for the boost in stats. Shinto shrines are like an unpolished climbing section from Uncharted. While I personally didn't enjoy the Haiku's, at least I can appreciate them trying something different. 

But the saddest part about the side content is that it makes exploration worthless. You'll never find anything off the beaten path. The world is gorgeous, and yet there's no real point in truly exploring, because outside of the aforementioned question marks, the world is completely empy. Except for Mongol patrols, which are everywhere. But when the rest of the game is all about killing an insane amount of Mongols, I'm not looking for more of them when I'm just riding from point A to B quickly. 

TL;DR: Ghost of Tsushima is not a terrible game, but it's incredibly repetitive and has poor side content.


I 100 percented the game during COVID lockdown, and your review definitely got me thinking. You are totally right about the monotonous enemies, and a lot of the side quests are pretty meh. 

But … it was the perfect game for me during lockdown. I would just wander the countryside and take in the scenery. I would chase foxes to their shrine, and wear different outfits depending on my mood. I would zone out to the ambient shakuhachi flutes, and bang my head to the taiko drums. I would compose haiku under the stars, and perfect my showdown stances. The whole game felt organic and natural. 

When I finished the game, living there in that little hut, with all the trophies, I luxuriated in the memories of each one, like having a glass of wine with an old friend. It was bittersweet but fulfilling, and I still remember it fondly.
    Same exact thing, I platinumed this game and loved almost every second of it. I almost always play games while listening to podcasts but I made myself just enjoy the atmosphere of this game. I was bored a couple times maybe, but on the whole I enjoyed it so much.
    Those touches were MAGICAL for the first 10 hours. The first time I wrote a haiku was an experience that made me reevaluate how I view video games. The next 10 hours, I was getting a little impatient with the shallow characters. The next 30 hours were an absolute slog - but punctuated by an amazing ending. I just played and beat this last month, but I need some distance from it to evaluate how I really feel about it.
        The haiku in particular was a perfect use of the controller speaker.

Never had it before when the best part of a game for me has been the collectibles.
            I also liked how the haiku made you sit and APPRECIATE the view. I tend to zone out when I play and miss the vistas and I liked those segments. I did find some of the syllable choices not very appropriate and the “same” meditation song every time did wear thin
        The ending really is incredible. Why couldn't the rest of the game be that good???
        I was completely enthralled by the game. Getting off work and wanting to get home and play. I just wish they had more of a stealth setting while doing things as a ninja. Hiding in tall grass is fine and yeah I guess the ninja'ing was kinda a sub gameplay setting compared to fighting and doing things as a samurai. Even though the stealth and doing things against samurai code was a part of the game, they could of had two distinct play styles during combat and gameplay. Maybe the second one will have more.
            This is where mission design comes into play. You could totally stealth every Mongol village or take it by brute force. It would be cool, for example, completing the mission by destroying the black powder cache only with stealth, or having the enemies play defensively around the Mongol warlords. Towards the end of the game when you are collecting the Mongol armor, you had to duel each leader - it needed more of that. Maybe the enemies were the same 5 types, but they could have varied the "boss" characters to add some character and depth.
        Yea, it got old real fast after they stopped introducing new things

I still have the DLC to do and have very little desire to boot it up again
            The DLC has a dope story, and it really gets into the Sakai history, but in terms of game play it's the same ol shit
    Yeah pretty much this. 

I loved the game but I’m also experiencing open world fatigue where the worlds are just too big. 

I’ve been leaning lately towards older open world games because there’s so damned much. Don’t get me wrong…it’s a gorgeous masterpiece of a game, but it’s also kind of a one and done for me.
        I still maintain two of Vice City taped together is the largest size any open world "needs" to be, and even then smaller experiences can be awesome.  Go walk around Kabukicho in the Yakuza series.  Frickin' sublime, even though you can run across the map in about 5 minutes.
            Yes I prefer a dense map to a big map. Too much traveling gets boring after a while.
    What this nails for me is such games being a bit of a sandbox where you have the freedom to play the way you want, which can also define one’s enjoyment.

This game really seemed to resonate with those that just kinda chilled and enjoyed the aesthetic while organically making their way through the story.

On the other hand I’ve heard similar critique to the OP from friends but most of them were the type to burn through the game in a week or two and charge from mission to mission and focus on completion.

I don’t think either is wrong, but it definitely affects one’s enjoyment and perception imho.

I’d have likely had similar concerns if I mained it but I dipped in an out when I felt like a bit of samurai action and spent a lot of time just chilling and exploring it.

I think many gamers now binge, with finishing the game being the goal, which highlights a lot of valid criticisms when played that way, but are also vastly less noticeable or concerning if you pace it out and enjoy the journey.
    I know what you mean about the perfect lockdown game. I was let go due to COVID causing financial issues for my company and spent a lot of time without a job. Jurassic World Evolution and Death Stranding were my two lockdown games. Just helping claw back a bit of a sense of accomplishment with a well designed park or quickly delivered package. I've not really been back to JWE since but during Covid it was perfect.
    That's what Red Dead 2 was for me. It was almost lile bring outside.
    Had the same feeling about Mad Max. Somehow repetitive but in a good way.
    100%. It was my favorite game of the last few years, above both God of Wars. Everything about it stunned me, and having grown up with Dynasty Warriors, repetitive combat does absolutely no harm to a game for me.

10/10
    It was the first game I'd ever Platinumed and I was disappointed that there wasn't more to do when I was done.
    I got the game when it came out and I was locked down and laid off from COVID. It was the first game in a long time I played start to finish without bouncing around to other games
    I totally agree with you. I changed my style of play depending on what was going on in the story, from just surviving, to trying to be honorable, to being a merciless ghost. Part of the difference between you/me  and OP is "buy-in." I felt like I was inhabiting the world and the character, and they didn't. For me, the repetitive enemies were fine: each slash of the blade and clang of swords felt real and interesting to me, because I was bought in to the world.
My biggest mistake was  going 100% on the first region and then totally burning out on subsequent regions. It's an OK game with amazing visuals but it really starts dragging once the visuals stop being so impressive because you get used to them. 

The combat was also basically rock paper scissors and button mashing.
    I spoiled the game for myself doing this.  

I was so completely enthralled with the beauty.  I'm a huge Akira Kurosowa fan, so it was perfect for me.  But after I cleared the first region I lost all steam.  

I really, really don't like the direction open world games have gone.  They're so repetitive.
        [deleted]
            ...yeah that one's always weirded me out.  Nobody is holding a gun to your head forcing you to 100% a game.  Also like when people complain a game is "too easy."  Buddy, nobody is MAKING you use those unlimited continues or OP superweapon.  I got so good at Super C back in the day I started doing one life challenges and whatnot.

Why do people need their hands held 24/7?  Exercise some agency and play the way *you* want to.
            Yeah I love this sub, but sometimes reading about how people approach video games and how they play them and what constitutes "not respecting your time" makes me want to scream internally. I have to prevent myself from commenting to not seem like a party pooper. But at some point I think a lot of these people are deliberately choosing to play in ways that make you hate video games and all I can do is shrug and say it's your life.
            Because it's all new and interesting in the first area. You're discovering new things, helping everyone, upgrading and cleariv things out, meeting characters, etc. But then the next regions is all the same stuff. Which, until you advance into it, you don't really know is going to happen
                How do you not think the next area will be more of the same? Basically every game builds on this repetition... I can't think of a single game where this doesn't happen...
                    They do a pretty good job of hiding how much is yet to be revealed.  You reveal a ton in the first region, and if you're leisurely playing through, that first region can rack up 30 hours.  I had no idea it was barely a third of the game.
            Yeah, I never understood this either. Devs are even starting to make fun of players, like BOTW having a literal poop be you reward for finding all korok seeds.

&#x200B;

You're not really expected to do all the content. It's spread around so no matter where you go, you can find content and gain resources, but this idea that you have to 100% an open world game is insanity. No wonder people hate these games.
            Totally agree with this! I LOVED GoT and got close to 100%. I genuinely could not get enough of every aspect, Even when it was boring I loved it. The extra bloat content was made for me!! Lol. I am so glad it's there. I ignore it for other games.
            People were bitching about all the stuff to do in Hogwarts Legacy and I mentioned the same thing. Just because there is stuff to do, doesn't mean you have to do it all.
            When you start a lot of open world games, you aren't yet aware that the small and semi interesting task you just did is going to need to be done umpteen more times again in every new area or region. So, in your first main area, you do the fetch quests, the mini game or two, the catch this task, follow that task, talk to these folks task, etc. Starter main areas also tend to be the most polished aspect of the game; it's the area or region that most developers spent the largest amount of time refining. It's the area that devs are using to 'show off' the game at expos and in demos.

So, while no one is 'forcing anyone', many players think that the next area or region or whatnot is going to be equally as fun and full of new tasks to do, and therein is the problem with most open world games, because the next area is going to be a slightly visually different but copy pasted version of that first area, and the next as well, and so on and so forth. The fetch this thing or follow that quest might be enjoyable once or twice because they are new, but not fifteen or twenty times. Too many open world games fill their world with these pretty mediocre bite sized tasks that just aren't that much fun to do more than once even.

You don't really know ahead of time what is going to be repetitive to you, until you've already repeated it enough that you've lost interest in doing it again. That can have a negative impact on how you then view the remainder of the game as well. Now you're staring at some marked up map full of things to do that you've little interest in doing. That is the definition of just straight up poor design, but devs are not going to stop chunking in that kind of content because it is relatively easy and cheap to do. Poor design is when you turn your players off from actively playing large segments of the content.

Of course, some are not going to mind the repetition, but that is less for the sake of the content and more for the completion of the content. Those players would play through to completion regardless, not simply because they enjoy the repetition.
        I mean. They've not really changed. Most seem to have cookie-cutter content all over the place. It's rare to find games that have interesting optional content with good stories.
    > The combat was also basically rock paper scissors and button mashing.

and dark souls is just roll roll attack. Not sure why people think simplifying games down to their core is some kind of 'own' lol. Mario is just pressing the A button, Doom is just clicking on enemy sprites, etc.
    I did the same thing and was burnt out on the second region. After a quest made me chase This smoke for about 10 minutes I finally decided to quit
        Wow I'm glad I'm not the only one, I really thought this was gonna be a game I could happily 100% but damn if I wasn't burnt out and underwhelmed by the repetitiveness and the protagonists personality/story.
    That is exactly what I did, going a little too hard on all the side content. I enjoyed the game, but after a certain point, a quick break with another game turned into a permanent break
    Thank god I’ve found my people. I was so sick of the discourse around this game when it came out- people pumped this game way way way too high up as a reaction to the divisive TLOU reactions when this game was beautiful but so, so mid.
        Were did all those people who cried about killing dogs in TLOU go? You have to kill so many dogs in GoT
            Oh I can field that one!

You don't have to listen to people cry snivel and wail like it's the end of the world about their guard dog every time you kill one in Ghost.  Guard dogs aren't housepets.  They're tools.  A dead guard dog doesn't mean you have an emotional breakdown, it means you sound the alarm.  TloU 2 tried to go so heavy on the pathos I first got bored with it and then I was seeing it as a comedy by the end.

Ellie (storyline wise, it really was not just game mechanics separation) murdering her way through dozens of unsuspecting people then deciding not to kill Abby had me rolling on the floor.  Bitch, why do you suddenly give a fuck about killing helpless people?
                [deleted]
                    I mean seriously, Ellie is willing to wholesale slaughter people for nothing more than trying to keep raiders (you know, like Ellie is) out of their land.  Sneaking up and quietly slitting the throats of people who would probably do no more than jail her or run her out of town is morally pure and just.  When it came to killing someone that actually wronged her?  Oh no that's a bridge too far!  Only a monster would do THAT and Ellie doesn't wanna become a MONSTER.

I wonder how many other people Ellie killed under the cover of night on her way back home afterwards?
                    Hey at least with Dollar General Indiana Jones his personality is consistent.  We know he's a selfish egotistical twat, and his games aren't trying to be THOUGHT PROVOKING REVOLUTIONARY WORKS OF ART!

I can buy Nathan's motivations even if I personally find the character repugnant.
                        [deleted]
                            Hence "Dollar General Indiana Jones."  He is not bright.
                You seem to really enjoy shitting on people with more emotional depth than you.
        Yup, if this was an Assassin's Creed game, people would have shat on it immediately. It plays almost exactly like one, super repetitive. But it was beautiful. The atmosphere and music was awesome.
    This is exactly what happened to me and I didn’t even realize it
    Exactly what happened to me, only I also fully cleared the second region. I stopped doing almost all the side stuff from then on. Loved the combat though….there was a fort in the middle of I think the second region that was I guess a story fort. You werent supposed to go there yet, so the alarms pop off and they send endless guys, and it was so fun just fighting them all. Eventually they sent magic death arrows to kill me but just taking on a giant mass of enemies was so satisfying
    This happened to me with Witcher 3.
    This is me with any open world game.

I've come to realise I much prefer more scripted linear games than open world games.
        You can just play the main quest line and ignore the side stuff. This is what I've done with Assassin's Creed games, Horizon, etc. and it keeps me from burning out. Most side content is repetitive anyway.
    Same here. I went hard with the side quests in the first region and found myself getting bored but decided to push on, thinking I must be approaching the end game. Then the map opens up and basically doubles in size, which caused me to nope out and never come back. It’s a good example how having too much ‘content’ for the sake of content can drag down the overall experience. Some games can get away with it, but GoT just didn’t have enough gameplay variety to sustain it.
    Did you play on hard mode? It really does make a big difference in combat.
        yea I was on hard
            You must be really good at games.
                i’m.. well, i’m kind of a pro gaymer myself, I’ll have you know 😏😏
                    Pro gaymer moves
                    you're a trackmaniac so you really are a pro gamer !! <3
        Once you upgrade in hard mode you can easily massacre any battle. The only way to play with the concept of dying for yourself is the realism one hit death mode as long as you don’t go stealthy. You are a one man arsenal in this game.
        This was huge for me- I never ever change difficulties in games but GOT really required me going to the highest level and that made it way better
    You're allowed to take breaks and come back. That's what i did with this and got the enjoyment of the full game twice by clearing everything on both major halfs of the island.

Disagree about the combat. Weird take.
    So your rec is just to focus on the main quests? My copy is in cellophane and I’ll probably crack it open next weekend.
        Do the main quest, take in the beauty, do stuff you organically come across. Chase some foxes to pet them.
            Good to know... i hadn't realized there were multiple islands yet lol.
        The Sidestory quests for each secondary character are really good too.

I even enjoyed the random people's quest but I also tried to focus more on the story they told and it made me feel like I was playing some kind of Kurosawa-like, wandering samurai serial.

However, if you only play games for the fighting mechanics and don't care too much about story then you'll probably want to go do the main story and the secondary characters.
    Late to the post but I agree completely. I wish I’d find more story as to progression overall at first.
I think Ghost of Tsushima is *excellent* when it is doing things to separate it from other titles (duels, companion quests, mythic tales) but suffers greatly when it acts like a big standard open world adventure. 

I think if it cut the fat, and the skirmishes were more intimate rather than taking on armies single handedly; the game could have been one of the all time greats. As is stands it is a gorgeous romp through Japan with some exciting ideas tossed into a tedious open world. 

Still enjoyed it enough to play it twice though.
    I agree. There’s enough here that I think a sequel could be really good. Flesh out the characters, make the quests and fighting more varied, and make the open world fun to interact with
    Think you’ve hit the nail on the head there. The duels were my absolute favourite, so incredibly cinematic. Was a thrill every time. All the other stuff I generally skipped unless it gave me some cool cosmetics.
    Funny - I get what you're saying but I'll add that my favorite part about the game was that it cut out so much of the standard AAA open world fat in the first place - I loved the wind guide, I loved that "crafting" and upgrading was about as minimal as it get, etc. 

It wasn't exactly anything earth shattering per se, but if you're going to do that formula I'm so so glad that they cut down on a ton of that stuff.
    This, I absolutely second that take!
I'm currently running through Horizon: Zero Dawn and having similar issues. What's really helped me is just embracing an anti-completionist attitude. I try all the side activities at least once, but I only continuously do the ones that I enjoy and otherwise focus on main quests. It's helped me appreciate the games strengths a lot more, and scaled back the repetitive feelings.
    This game is so overrated. They focused on combat and still it's crappy. You're supposed to be using all these kinds of arrows and stuff, but will quickly discover that there are ways that work on everything. Freeze it, shoot it with three arrows from the big bow,  it takes a minute to drop anything. Also there are flying enemies, but you can't aim straight up, so when they're above you, you can't do shit 😄 Also the story was supposed to be mind blowing. It isn't.
        I mean... Sure, you can drop lots of enemies with that combo, but you have to know what to shoot, your gear has to be good enough to freeze your enemy quickly and you have to not miss. And you get resource-starved pretty quick if you use the freeze slingshot on everything.

And the combo won't necessarily work on the toughest enemies. Thunderjaws need a couple ropes and some armor blasting to make that work. The burrowing enemies are harder to catch. And hitting the combo is hella harder to do when you're under attack by 3 hyper-aggressive ravagers
            It just works. Maybe I really good I the game, but I reaaaaallyyu doubt it 😄 Never ran out of ammo either. It's annoying to try and hit them in the tiny weak spots since I discovered how effective this was. Dropped the legendary boss thunderjaw easily. Was disappointed how easy it was. Also I swear, they know when you're going to release the arrow and then move. Test it. Just hold the bow drawn, aim, wait... you can keep your reticle on target easily. As soon as you release the arrow they suddenly twitch and get out of the way. I'm convinced the game cheats that way. Made me stop trying, since freeze + blast them with highest damage arrows while they're frozen method drops anything. And when this ruined the combat for me... there's nothing else to this game. My GF liked it though, but she doesn't play a llt of games, so does not have anything to compare it to. It's a taboo topic now, I can't play it in her presence, cause she gets pissed when I criticize it 😆
                Hmmm... I've never encountered any input reading issues in that game. You were playing on max difficulty, right?

Edit: but yeah, at one point, even thunderjaws can be killed in a couple arrows. But that's normal, you get stronger and stronger over the course of the game
                    Yes. Also tried to make it more difficult for myself so no healing during combat.
                        Is it you, Napoleon?
    Late to this but Spiderman suffers from the same dull experience. Once you get past the swinging through NY it's just the same over and over.
I think it would have been a better 30 hour game than a 60 hour game. It's probably doable in 30, but then you would have to ignore most of the content. It definitely overstays its welcome if you try to do everything though. I got bored with it and started cheezing every major battle with that unblockable triple attack. It totally breaks the duels.
    It could have easily cut the entire thing in half and it would have been better.  I dont feel like it took me much more than 35-40 hrs, but I only stuck with the main side quests and ignored every other filler MMO type quest
    Patientgamers taught me that a great game is a 10 hour game finished in 10 hours. 

A subpar game is a 10 hour game finished in 20 hours.
    Yikes so it suffers from the Ubisoft formula
        It does indeed, but it's significantly better than your standard Ubi-junk imo. 

It's not a masterpiece, and it's definitely one of Sony's weaker offerings of late (but up against the rest of Sony output most recent AAA games look weak imo). But it's a solid game, visually beautiful, the combat is really tuned and precise, and there are a lot of serene moments throughout the game that immerse you into feudal Japan. 

I think it pays homage to that era like no other game to date, and that's where it really shines. 

It's very comparable to Hogwarts Legacy.
            It reminded me of Horizon Zero Dawn if you are to compare it to Sony’s other titles.

Absolutely gorgeous graphically, and with some uniqueness/DS4 features in the setting of Japan and each different robot you can fight/control.

But I just found each world to not have that much there, which was a shame really given the reviews for each one.

At least with Horizon Aloy sounds like she’s got some life to her.  With the exception of one scene English Jin has just sounded quite dull/expressionless imo.
                Watching more samurai or wuxia films might help you acclimate more to a stoic Asian protagonist
                    Oh they’re like that?

Fair enough then - I’ll put it down to Ghost being my introduction to the genre.

I mean part of me did think that but at the same time it just felt odd - like several scenes when the atmosphere is quite tense say Jin (English Jin anyway) just didn’t sound like he was that bothered.
                        Pretty much. The stock hero character is dignified, unflappable, genteel in the face of adversity. Maybe the voice acting performance + limitations of the video game medium didn't convey the tension well. These things are often conveyed with facial expressions or body language moreso than direct emotionality
        I've somehow stayed away from the Ubisoft formula during my entire childhood and teenage years and am now starting to play some games and see what it is with games like Horizon and some of the new Tomb Raider as well as trying out some AC games.

There is a whole "sweep the map" thing going on, and it feels very hard if not impossible to go off the path you think the developpers would have wanted to have you on. It really feels like you're being railroaded, and exploring is very unrewarding, which should never happen in an open world.

So I see why people complain about it and agree with the criticism but I wonder why some game don't suffer from the same pitfalls despite having many similarities (open world explorarion games.)

Like... Rockstar and Bethesda also do open world rpg/adventure/exploration type of games and they manage do not suffer from the same flaws (they have other flaws though, Bethesda for instance makes remarkably unpolished games, although I really like their formula.)

The one who makes me the most curious though is Zelda Breath of the Wild, Nintendo really made an odd beast with this one, I find that it rewards exploration in a way other games like it don't, and I'm not quite sure how it does that. It made me feel like I was doing things I wasn't supposed to, exploring places I wasn't supposed to be in (even though I'm sure this was all intended.)
    Atleast they could've added more enemies and/or have more civilians walking around on roads and doing stuff like they do in their camps.
I really liked the game, but I agree on the combat. In particular, the fact that the stances worked like Rock Paper Scissors (you have to use stone stance against shielded enemies) was not a good choice. It made the stances feel forced. 

A stance against an enemy with shield should be good because of how it moves and feels. Not because “if correct stance is chosen, then deal damage. Otherwise attacks bounce back”
    I agree. It would have been better if all stances could be used, but they had different pro’s and con’s. Instead of only dealing damage when choosing the right one
        Hey OP, if you haven’t already you should check out the Nioh games. They also employ a stance system in their combat but it’s waaay more complex than what Tsushima does. I won’t say it’s necessary to master stance switching to beat the games, but learning how to really opens them up and gives you access to tons of combos, almost like a fighting game in a way.
            I tried Nioh 1 lately but it felt really overbearing with so much loot dropping, and I felt miserably bad at it (even Dark Souls made me feel better after the learning curve)... I really liked the japanese mythology theme and wanted to like the game but I couldn't get it to click for me
    I actually enjoyed the way it was structured and how it forced you to use the different stances but I'm not really into complex fighting games either.

Overall, I agree the game was repetitive but my goodness I loved every minute of it.
    That's a good point.
    If I’m honest I’m still not sure what each stance is for.  I’ve been in the same one for pretty much the whole game and any enemy that‘s proving to be more difficult I just cheese with either a kunai or arrow.
        The mnemonics are mostly based on the Playstation face buttons.

X: two crossed swords.  
O: circular shield.  
Triangle: spear head.  
Square: square shield/big square dude (tenuous)
            Never thought of it that way actually.
        They just map to the different enemies and makes it easier to deal with them. 4 enemy types - 4 stances (sword guys, shield guys, spear guys, beeeg guys).

My best guess is it only makes a difference on the higher difficulties when you really need to be intentional with how you deal damage or you get your ass handed to you.
    I think it feels forced when the game doesn't like that you're using the "wrong" stance,then it kinda pauses automatically and says "use stone stance with shielded enemies". Like,nah,I could take them down with whatever I want! Why give me options if you can't use whatever whenever.
Dang I truly felt the opposite about this game. I enjoyed every moment of it. You’re right there is not much unit variety but somehow the combat never bored me. The DLC was harder and I wish they did more along those lines true. I loved all the side stuff too
Its my fav game in a very long time. Got the plat on the PS4 on release, and happily did it again when i got the upgrade on the PS5. Cant wait to have it in my Steam library, and do it all again with mods. When I originally played it in 2020, I felt it was my fav game of that decade. Have yet to play a game in the last 2 years I love more. The whole thing was like I was playing one of my beloved Samurai movies. 

I dont know why all the things you mentioned that bothered you, didnt bother me. I would get excited when I saw the Fox dens, since it meant there was a chance I could pet one.(love giving animals scritches in games lolol) The stoic character felt authentic to the the type of old school Samurai movies they were seemingly inspired from. The game sure had several of the open world tropes that studios are apparently tied to these days, but I guess that bothers me less than others, since I just seem to ok with kind of stuff in general for some reason. I was constantly finding the house banners in all sorts of weird places, but I can see how that wouldnt necessarily be fun, if what you want to do is explore and get something worthwhile out of it.

It sucks that everyone didnt love it as much as me, but then again, I dont like so many things others love. I guess I was lucky that something that clicked so hard with me was made.
    We all know many people like open world games. It's why we have 99 AssCreed titles. There is obviously an audience for this stuff.
Games like this are best played a bit at a time, mixed in with other games and activities.  I loved it.   All I expected from it was high quality fighting on a big beautiful landscape, and i got that and more.
    I loved everything about GoT. First game I platinum naturally because I just wanted to do everything because I was having so much fun. The combat was especially awesome, my god. And those duels were just so cool.
    That's how I enjoyed Mad Max. Play it for a few hours, come back a week or so later play more, take a month off and come back. No harm in that.
100%ing before moving on is a mistake in this game. You should try to keep the intensity of the narrative at the forefront with minimal side questing. I didn't do this, and found the last 3rd of the game simultaneously felt narratively too short while also feeling like the mechanics overstayed their welcome. Exploration and completion should be left to the end, largely.
Besides the bog standard generic open world under the gorgeous paint job, my biggest issue was the dissonance between the storytelling and the way I chose to play the game. I’ve always been incredibly bored by stealth, so I would never sneak or assasinate or use any of the tools. I would just run up to camps, do the standoffs and then fight everyone. 

But that meant it really pulled me out of the story when literally every time I talk to someone they’re giving me shit for sneaking around and assassinating people. It’s my own fault for not engaging with all of the systems and they clearly had a specific story they wanted to tell, but I just had a really hard time connecting with or getting invested in the story when it was based entirely around my character being accused of things I would actively try to avoid unless the game gave me no other choice.
    It's actually a term, called 'ludonarrative dissonance' (which you probably know but for the benefit of passers by) which a lot of games suffer from.

When there's dissonance between the gameplay narrative and the story narrative it's really jarring and it happens in a lot of games that haven't thought about giving the player the freedom they've given them.

It's like when you're murdering thousands of enemies in gameplay and then in a cutscene get all upset about killing one person, it's just fucking jarring.
        GTA San Andreas in a nutshell
            Or GTA 4.
        Though many games are guilty of this, one of the most jarring I've experienced was Uncharted 4.
    I liked and disliked that the game didn’t react to your play style. At first I thought it was lame that there wasn’t a second ending for people who never assassinated anyone ever. But then I realized that it would be incredibly limiting to gameplay.
    I think this game would have really benefited from a simple honor system like in RDR2, and have different endings depending on your choices. 

I stormed through the main gate every time, and never used poison darts. Yet the game kept telling me how dirty I fought
        >I think this game would have really benefited from a simple honor system like in RDR2, and have different endings depending on your choices.

I dunno, I kinda feel like that stuff is just a little overrated. If a game is really story driven and it's not some big Skyrim-type RPG, I kinda just want them to tell their story. Sure, maybe there's some 'ludo-narrative dissonance' but then if you do it a lot you go the other way and you get a game with a really watered down story.

Like, yeah, the ninja/stealth stuff clashing with the honor culture is part of the conflict in the game. I wasn't sneaking everywhere on my own time but the game forces you to sneak enough where it basically justifies it. Otherwise you get a playthrough where your uncle and everyone is just like "Hey man, great job storming that camp... anyway..."
    Yeah they should’ve written in another ending & made one canon
    They could've worked it in better by actually having an interesting and unique stealth system, rather than the exact same skeletal framework that every ubisoft style game uses but with even fewer features

It's all about becoming the Ghost out of necessity, but outside of specific story missions it's neither fun nor necessary, so feels very contrived when you're forced into it
    Same!  I always fought everyone straight up on unless the game literally forced me to do otherwise.  Stealth is pretty boring to me too and at least at first the combat was pretty fun.  So combat was the way I went.  Got pretty annoying that everyone kept talking down to me when I'm the biggest badass to have ever badassed, can take on the mongols like 60 to one, and do it all while just walking slowly up to their camp and shouting out a challenge.

I wish they had made the combat *way* harder, like almost impossible to take on more than a couple mongols at a time.  Then it would've made me feel forced to use the stealth systems to whittle the enemies down until they were at a manageable number to fight.
This is the first game I got the platinum for in forever on PS. For me it was the first interesting open world in a long time. Somewhat monotonous true, but I found it more interesting than many open world games on the past few years. Instant fast travel with no load screen also definitely kept it from getting as boring as I thought it would.

Combat wasn’t super complicated, but I am not someone who needs it to be. I loved the Arkham games a ton for the ability to make me feel like I was good without actually being super complex. It’s no dark souls for sure, but I am not the type of gamer who can engage with a game like that and have as much fun. The rock paper scissors combat let me feel like I was alright at games without being TOO easy.

Right after this I played Jedi: Fallen Order and was let down by how clunky the controls felt. Ghost of Tsushima was smooth and the combat felt crisp. In contrast, Fallen Order felt bulky and I found myself frustrated feeling like I’d pressed block and it had been ignored by my enemy.

Over all, one of my favorite games in a long time, but I can understand why people might like more of a challenge. This was one of the first true PS5 games I played so it definitely was a looker for me.
I think the combat is incredibly fun and gets more fun as you unlock more upgrades but the story and side quests fall super flat. Everyone always acts so subservient and grateful towards you its exhausting.
    That's probably how it would have been though for a Samurai back then.
I agree. I LOVED the game, for the first half. Then gave up on haikus and vanity gear. Then started getting annoyed at yet another copy paste side quest. I feel like they had such a great game that they diluted by milking it for every last added hour of gameplay possible. 

  I feel like a lot of open world games do that, and GoT, being maybe in my top 3 open world games ever, showed me that maybe the right approach to an open world game is just doing what I like or enjoy and that's that. For people who don't get sick of the copy paste, there's more there for them. For me, maybe I should just pass on things I'm losing interest in. Maybe my feeling of obligation to get everything out of the game that is offered is the issue, and not that the game keeps offering more.
    I think only doing the content you enjoy will help you like these games more. I stopped doing the quests I didn’t enjoy early on, but the repetitiveness shines through even if you just do the main quests and companion quests
Remember when cheap Isshin said "we need fat army for castle" thought I'd get a large battle with amazing cinematics, all we got was 5 guys fighting the same enemies
I pretty much mainlined the game so I never had all that much burnout. 

The world was gorgeous, a beautiful period piece/story of culture clashing with an enemy that doesn’t care about that tradition, great personal dynamics & I thought the combat was great. 

Now because I mainlined it I didn’t give the combat much time to get stale & then Legends really expanded on combat to a fantastic degree which is where I spent over double the campaign length. 

I dunno, I loved the game. Best Assassins Creed I’ve ever played & because I love the old AC games, that ends up being an amazing game.
>Fox Dens are just there.

Fox Dens are fucking everywhere. Mongols aren't the only invasive species it seems.

I loved the game and had fewer complaints, but I get all of your points. None are surprising.

I enjoyed the hell out of the combat for at least 80% of the game, so I didn't mind how most side quests boiled down to "talk to someone or stare at something on the ground and walk until MONGOLS". Okay, finally, more combat I thought. I do agree that they would have done well to be more creative with quest design at times.

The only thoughts I have on exploration are it's a drop dead gorgeous game with average climbing segments and too many fucking **FOX DENS**. Like what the fuck? I never got tired of enemy camps but Fox Dens? By the final region, if a question mark on the map turned out to be **ANOTHER** Fox Den, I'd get pissed. We needed at least 1 additional side activity on the map so they could cut back on time spent following those orange bastards.

Also the Iki Island dlc was great. Had a blast. 8/10 too many Fox Dens.
I recently started playing this game and if I'd read your post whilst I was playing act one I would have mostly disagreed. However, I'm now in act two and I completely agree with every syllable.

Follow this person very sneakily and don’t get caught and if you lose sight of them for a *split second*, even if they’re walking down a straight road in a **canyon** you will get a ticking count down that will make you panic and run out of cover and get spotted.

Footprints in the mud. No one should have to deal with them on such a grand scale.

I want a wheel for armor so I don't have to navigate in to menus and back out of menus every time I need to change clothes because I am a woman and my clothes follow my moods, which are varied and numerous and change faster than the weather in this game.

I spend so much time playing the shakuhachi to get rid of the endless rain, clouds, fog, thunder, lightning and wind that I feel like the Pied Piper.

The damned horse has a seizure every time I press the gallop button. The creature knows what galloping is, it shouldn’t act so surprised when asked to do so.

I basically just mutter ‘fuck off’ to the yellow birds now. They’re everywhere, all the time and they NAG. I wish you could shoot the bloody things.

The land is cliffy. So very cliffy;  Ooh look, something that could possibly be  interesting over there that the bloody yellow birds don’t know about….oh dear, I’m on *yet another* cliff, rocky outcrop, mountain and I can’t get down, maybe if I run along the edge a bit….nope, still can’t get down. Maybe I can just drop to the ledge below….nope, stuck like glue and I’m not going to chance the jump drop and roll manoeuvre because that *never* ends well. C’mon horse, lets travel a mile out of our way to get down to this interesting item. Yes, gallop please and don’t look so shocked about it, *drama queen*.

Fun fact: Interesting looking items are invariably not interesting in the slightest and are certainly not worth the horse-trauma to gallop to them.

**Rescue the hostages**: Kill….kill…kill…Can I rescue you yet? Sorry but no, there’s a Mongol half a mile away with his back turned, please go and kill him too because I don’t like the way his pants fit..…. Done, can I rescue you now? Sorry but no, there’s another Mongol asleep in a yurt that you missed at the other end of the camp, please go and kill him even though I can’t see what his pants look like. Then and only then will I shout for help, and not a second sooner. I am a hostage but I have standards.

I can only carry 8 heavy arrows but I can carry tons of iron, gold and steel, enough linen to clothe an entire continent and supplies that would stretch to the moon and back if laid end to end. Absurd, but with that lot it might at least explain why the horse hates to gallop.
    This was a fun read, and I really agree about your points. Everything about rescuing hostages is a nightmare. If it’s any consolation, it gets even worse in act 3. 

«There’s a guy sitting in the attic three houses down from where I am. You have to kill him before I go. Oh you killed him? Well you forgot about the one patrolling the pier all across the camp. I refuse to leave before he’s gone too»

And I agree about traversal being difficult. Is it realistic to only have one path up and down a cliff? Sure. Is it more fun and better gameplay when you can climb most things? Yes
        >Everything about rescuing hostages is a nightmare. If it’s any consolation, it gets even worse in act 3

Oh god......😒
    I'm checking my notes and I have 'Act 1: 8/10, Act 2: 10/10, Act 3: 8/10'

I suspect I might have skipped some things in Act 2 but thats where I got the most enjoyment out of the game.
I find hard to believe people calling it a 10/10, a masterpieces, best game of all time and all that shit. 

It's the classic open world game that Sony does but with a Japanese setting. Then it's all the same. Woulda probably been much better have it not been an open world game with all that... emptiness and repetitive activities it has.
    It’s another one of those games that made me increasingly more weary of believing the hype when the ‘press’ (in quotes because the dynamics of gaming press right now mean that most of them are effectively paid-for marketeers) and fellow gamers talk about must play games and system sellers etc. This was another open world game, once again excellent presentation, once again a dead world with lots of repetition and whose claim to fame, strictly from a gameplay standpoint, was the wind instead of quest marker. The concept is very stale at this point, far cry 2 came out 15 years ago and nobody’s found a way around a lot of the limits that the formula already had back then.
        I have absolutely no way to prove my not-very-fleshed-out theory, but I've always felt like the insane praise that GoT got is directly related to the backlash that TLOU2 received. They're very different games, but both sort of came out at the same time and dominated online game circles for a while. TLOU2 is objectively the better game -- both technically, story-wise and graphically -- with more fluid gameplay and superior acting performances. It might not be everyone's cup of tea and some people might personally prefer GoT, but I find it baffling how people can call GoT the superior game. 

The main critique I kept reading about TLOU2 were about the story and pacing, but I'll never understand how the shallow story and repetitive pacing of GoT could somehow be better? I understand that these things are subjective, but like, there's just no way. Some even called GoT the game of the year, which was especially mind-blowing considering Miles Morales, Half Life: Alyx and Hades also came out in 2020.

I liked GoT at first, but wasn't able to finish it. I couldn't get over how lifeless everything felt: from the wooden acting to the robotic facial animations to the barren open world. Using the wind as a compass was fun, but felt like railroading to me -- there was absolutely nothing to explore besides the few places the wind pushed you towards. I don't know, maybe it's me though. I never understood the online love that Days Gone got either.
            I'm 100% convinced of the same thing lol. For whatever reason, people choose GoT as their champion just because they were mad at tlou2. And my other theory related to that is that most people that were complaining about one and praising the other had actually played neither of them.
    Maybe you should just accept you're in the minority of not liking it.
Play the Iki Island arc. It's a lot better and a lot more fun. Jins personality shines there.
I say this every time this game comes up: don't sleep on the multiplayer. It really is a ton of fun. I had a group of 4, and we had a blast going through it.
    How does it differ from the single player?
        They're basically two totally separate games. where single player kept it pretty realistic overall, multiplayer goes all in on old Japanese horror feel. It's not scary to play, but more ghosts and mystical things, a lot more spooky with more fantastic environments. Multiplayer has 3 modes: tales, waves, and raids. 

Tales is a string of 2 player coop missions with lots of collectables and challenges, stuff like opening extra chests for loot, optional super tough fights, new enemies, needing to stay within a certain range of your coop buddy, etc. It's exceptionally well done. 

Waves is 4 player survival. You've got 3 points to defend against various waves of enemies with a boss wave every 3rd wave if I remember correctly. It could use a few more maps to play on, but there was enough variety in enemies, challenges, and upgrading loot and builds to make it last a long time. 

Raids is only for max level characters, and there are 3 of them. The first two are extremely challenging, and they will take a few hours to complete, and you can't save progress in the middle. These are exceptionally well done. I absolutely loved them and wish there was more. Stuff like two zones to defend, one person on each, while the other two have to go through a gauntlet fighting mostly invisible enemies to get a buff they have to drop off back in base. Very challenging, and some of them are really intricate and require solid teamwork. The last raid is one boss, but also very challenging. 

You may have noticed I mentioned loot and builds. There are 4 classes with some neat abilities, and each has unique weapons and tools. So I'll play one that throws a healing gourd, summons a spirit dog to help us fight, has a moon stance katana, and a poison blowgun while you might have one with an ultimate that does 5 enemy headshots and a bow and kunai that ignite enemies. 

GoT Legends, the multiplayer mode, is something I wish they'd turn into a full on live service game, and I hate live service games. But it's just so good. My group and I played the crap out of it for a while, and now I miss it. But at least I can encourage everyone else to get on it.
GoT is what I like to call an 'excellent average game', however I would argue that this is probably one of the - if not *the* - best average games ever. Other games I consider 'great average games' are games like Mad Max, Days Gone, Uncharted etc

Gameplay wise, the game doesn't do anything particularly special. Combat is relatively simple, but it's accessible without being too shallow. There is depth to be found. The approach you can take to combat is very varied and allows for a fair bit of variety in how you approach things. Do you sneak in and assassinate everyone? Do you just straight samurai everyone? Do you use ranged combat? Do you get in close quarters and use all your gadgets to give you the edge? It's very varied and I like it. I like engaging with all the different systems. (I also hate x-ray vision so I don't use it at all)

The scenery and setting is *beautiful*. Anyone who disagrees is, in my opinion, just being deliberately argumentative. I genuinely think it's undeniable. Ive lived in Japan and the way it captures so many different little bits of their culture and history in a respectful way is really impressive, and anecdotally I've heard that the Japanese liked it too. As a full blown gaijin I feel like it captured the mysticism and serenity of Japan as it is experienced by a westerner without being reductive or fetishistic.

The open world design is where it falls flat imo. Why, when you have foxes and birds and wind and all manner of other visual and audio cues to follow, would you litter the map with markers? Why?

I would far rather have had a Yakuza style smaller open world and pick up side quest content by interacting with the world and the people.

I found it also was too button mashy on normal. I wanted an experience that challenged me, required me to adhere to the samurai beats of punishing your enemy's mistakes, parrying, etc. I put it on the hardest difficulty where a few hits and you're dead and I found the combat much more rewarding, but dying wasn't unforgiving as you'd respawn outside the place you died and the checkpoints were generous. I played sekiro and I just couldn't get into it. I'm old and I've got a kid and I play games for fun and I just found it frustrating, and this gave me the samurai Japanese role playing experience I wanted.

I never found the game to be dull, but I did find that I didn't want to pick it back up after a while. I never finished it, but I'm currently replaying it as I get maybe half an hour game time each night after the baby is asleep and it's the perfect game to drop in for half an hour every night.
I generally agree with you but am still enjoying it very much. I'm 50 hours in and still in the middle of Act 2. I find the combat very fun and I happen to like the stealth.  I also find it gorgeous looking and love taking pics in photo mode.

However, I agree with you on the repetitive nature. I rarely get bored, but I've noticed that there isn't much variety to the missions. I find myself ocasionally feeling like it's a chore now, because I'm trying to find the last camps to free the first region and I'm just riding around encountering small groups of mongols to fight and NPCs I can't interact with. Still haven't found out how to free the region completely.

I think you're on point on the "very beautiful but empty world". I still like traversing it, but the NPCs are very generic, the dialogues are really basic outside of main cutscenes and there aren't easter eggs or vastly different environments to interact with (only to look at). That said, the beauty of the landscapes and the little things like finding swords in Altars of Honor and the straw hat duels help me engage. I expected a little more but overall am satisfied and having fun.
    If you don’t mind waiting: When you beat the main story, the remaining camps will show up on your map
        Thanks! I found that out by searching about it right before I saw your post. But I also searched the remaining camps in the area and freed Izuhara today lol I'll see what I'll do about the rest of them though
If you can discipline yourself to ignore the open world drudgery, it's quite a decent game. Less would have been more.
I get that the Jin wouldn’t just stop and play games, but it would’ve been nice to stop for a second and play some Shogi or some haiku battles to break up the pace. Maybe your opponents can be kids with the justification that you’re trying to give them joy or hope or whatever. I get that it would clash with the tone it’s going for, but some well-placed lightheartedness or humor would help break up the monotony.
Meh, not necessarily disagreeing with you, it definitely has its dull and repetitive moments. BUT in the grand scheme of open world games, it's one of the more unique ones.

Your complaints can basically be copied 1:1 to almost all open world games.
I thought it was a well decent game casual game. I had a fun enough time getting through the first part of the island, but felt that I had had enough at that point. I found the whole "honor" thing fairly exhausting though, and I don't know why Western depictions of Japan always include this in plots. A story about the warriors spirit would have been better. What I really wanted while I was playing it was for it to be a "Musashi simulator", but it was cool for what it was.
Once the extremely polished presentation wore off on me, I realized it was one of the most bog-standard ubisoft type open world games I'd ever played. It's fun, I still like those types of games, but people putting it on this crazy 10/10 pedestal are nonsense to me. It doesn't do nearly enough original stuff to deserve that praise.
>But the saddest part about the side content is that it makes exploration worthless. You'll never find anything off the beaten path.

I could at least see you're pov up until here. There is a ton of meaningful stuff to find while exploring. There aren't any huge empty areas. The side content is hardly poor. The shrines and bamboo strikes are a lot of fun and have good rewards. Sure, I think the foxes are lame, but there's a lot more side content than just the foxes.
    Bamboo strikes are a fine mini game. But this is kind of my point. I won’t find  anything except for the same kind of activities that’s already laid out on the map. 

Maybe I’m just more into exploring the unknown, and that makes it an unfair criticism of the game.
Yes, thank you!

I came into this game after finishing RDR2, and the world is soooooo dull. All the interactive spaces are clearly cut and paste and the loot and layouts are identical.

The open world is beautiful but just dull and boring. I got insanely bored after about 20 hrs in, and just gave up.
Extremely mediocre game with a great setting and visuals. Ubisoft on crack.
I liked the game but it wasn't perfect. I wish there were more meaningful things to do or collect. For example:

* Pillar of Honor, town merchants, dye merchant, and haiku were just for cosmetic items - this mechanic should have been more useful. Not to mention collecting crickets, Sashimono banners (I guess you get a cosmetic saddle?), and Mongol records - I didn't see the point.
* Of the useful things, we have mostly just bamboo strikes (no penalty for failure, as many tries as you want), fox dens (literally just follow a fox), and hot springs (press a button to think about...), which all give the same result throughout the game
* Most of the alternative armors they gave were useless - I understand the reason for the archer armor, traveler's armor, and the ronin armor, but the samurai armor is superior in almost every circumstance. Who wants to go into the menu and change into it when you need to fight for real?
* Give me a reason to go back to the survivor camps, enemy outposts, or liberated villages. After discovery there really is no point to go back.

And some of the design decisions they made were pretty weird.

* Just let me walk of off ledges instead of having to wiggle around until he drops down
* Jin is going to free solo up and down sheer cliffs in full samurai gear? lol, no
* Horse speed is either super fast or too slow - nothing in between. What if I just want to chill out and see the scenery at a reasonable pace?
* Enemy AI is pretty bad/unrealistic
* Zombie NPCs/static world

I think they did a great job with the atmosphere, and the sword fighting was simple but satisfying. I thought the open world itself was well designed with interesting geography and cute villages. The duels are exciting and especially the mass battles - like Yarikawa - were really cool, as well as the one where you use the hwacha. My mouth dropped open when Jin becomes the Ghost - such a cool scene. Despite all of my complaints, it's still a fun game and worth playing IMHO if you're into the feudal Japanese theme.
    I'm swapping between traveler's armor and the Clan Sakai armor, because the traveler's armor looks the best but the Clan Sakai armor has the perk of killing five dudes in a standoff (when combined with the skill), which is a big chunk of the enemies in camps and usually the entirety of the random patrols.
    > Not to mention collecting crickets, Sashimono banners (I guess you get a cosmetic saddle?), and Mongol records - I didn't see the point.

There's not really any point, but is there a point to anything in video games? I personally love collecting, and so I really enjoyed hunting down all of those items. I think it's more about what itches your proverbial gamer brain tickle lol.
I agree. I thought it was an overall decent game, but one that didn't live up to its potential. It felt to me like the kind of game they have to make before they can get it right in a sequel, kind of like how the first Assassin's Creed had a lot of issues but really came together with the Ezio sequels. At least, that's my hope.
I feel like what saves it is how good it feels to just exist in it. Walking, riding, combat, all feels amazing. Probably mostly because of the haptic feedback
Could you imagine how good this game could be if they fixed the issues that OP mentions here , I had the exact same experience.  Come on Sucker Punch more dueling , better less repetitive side quests ,more varied enemies and just generally more things in the open world apart from mongol patrols . Ghost of Tsushima 2 could be tremendous
I mean, to each their own but I loved pretty much every minute of it.
Spot on. I’m playing this game now and very much enjoying it. Looks awesome, the combat is fun, the gear is cool, and I like the storyline. That said, I fully liberated the first chunk of the map and now for Act II I’m basically just going from main mission to main mission to progress the story. Their really isn’t much point at all to exploration and my skills are all already basically maxed out anyway.
Totally agree with the repetitive nature of the game, I find most games end up feeling repetitive now that I'm an adult. I don't think it was dull though, the story was really good, everything is beautiful, and the landscape changes as you progress.

I was sorta let down by this game because the internet over hyped it, but that's not the games fault.
If you think GoT is dull and repetitive, I would stay away from the new Hogwarts game for sure.
This game lives and dies by how much you enjoy the gameplay loop

I absolutely adore stealth so I had a banger experience from start to end
One of the most overrated games of all time.
I felt this game and and a bunch of it's ilk are what I call time waster games. Spider-man, GTA V, Red Dead Redemption 2. I can spend an hour or two just swinging around New York and just do those random help missions. Same thing with GTAV, maybe sprinkle in some general mayhem shooting RPGs at traffic. RDR2 lets me indulge in some cowboy shenanigans.  
But you are right, I spent more time in those other games than I have in this. Wish I can do duels indefinitely because you are right, that is where I had the most fun in.
Agreed. Lost interest in this game after 10 hours
Edited in protest of 3rd party apps removal by reddit.
I think I already commented on here lol,but I've put 94 hours in bf2042,and 120 hours in Elden Ring,but Ghost of Tsushima...only 52 hours, I'm in part 2/the 2nd half,and everything is so repetitive and boring,the world(graphics) look amazing,but gameplay,it's "eh". The side quests suck,you don't even get anything really,just xp,and you have all these "materials" but need to collect flowers to actually buy something??,I've owned Elden Ring for like,half the time I've owned Ghost of Tsushima,and still have had more fun in that game. Sucks cause my bro told me how good this game was,now it just sits there lol.
    I think people who are new to open world games would enjoy it more than a normal gamer (who plays open world and other types of games regularly).
i just finished the game tonight and wanted to comment my thoughts, i’m glad to have found this thread because i don’t believe it to be a 9/10 game for me as most people were saying online. 



the game is of course beautiful! the scenery, the colors, the softness of the graphics, the rain under a full moon,  the snow falling from tall trees, lightning hitting on a field of red flowers, golden leaves falling at sunset. really relaxing and wonderful to explore. 



the story was very nice and heartfelt (my HORSE!!?). i loved all the characters, my girl yuna, and boy kenji were stars. the ending was heartfelt and i enjoyed jin. 



that being said there were some drawbacks. the world, though stunning, felt quite empty. every so often a fox den, then a mongol patrol, then maybe a honor shrine? rinse and repeat for an entire map! there should have been much more going on. 



even the wildlife, there was occasionally boars or a bear that could attack you - i felt like as the map progressed they really could have added more? there is a species of big cat that lives on tsushima they could have used. idk even snakes, just more wildlife encounters would have been interesting. 
it’s just the same bear over and over.



more world building to explore like caves or jungle or mountains to climb that mean something. the world felt very flat and there wasn’t much or any reward for exploring it. 



same repetitive mongol patrols. meh.



the side missions and saving people (i did all of them) felt boring and pointless. all they did were give you ‘supplies’ . same storylines of ‘follow the foot tracks until you find the bad guys’ leaving the scene of the crime often. like half way thru the game (maybe 3/4)  i was highest status i could be so there wasn’t much incentive to do them anymore. 



i felt like i had so many left over upgrades i could have used but didnt bother. that might have just been a me thing. i found a play style that worked for me and didnt need to upgrade like smoke bomb use and others? 



kind of a random note here but it was frustrating not being able to skip some dialogue. i liked how in hogwarts legacy you could skip a sentence of dialogue especially on side quests with the touch of a button. main quests dialogue skipping was discouraged. but in this game you couldn’t skip all the repetitive peasants thanking you stuff, it really just got boring. 



i wish there had been more roaming music!! when there was music it was STUNNING! the final fight with shimura, ahhh so good. i had chills dueling. but it felt so quite roaming the wild, i wish more music was playing. one of the greatest parts of skyrim was world exploration and the music whilst playing truly made the game magical.



overall i just felt this game was empty in the world building sense. the major towns were all beautiful but could have been more immersive with the npcs, maybe bars to go to, mini games idk. even the traders felt bland? the music and environment were 10/10 when used correctly but a lot of the time it felt flat because there wasn’t much to do/it wasn’t utilized properly. 



the things they did SO well is when they branched off from typical gameplay like the duels, haikus, the story missions (i can’t remember the name but they were in blue), the amount of characterizing outfits and the main storyline. i loved jin and his pals, i loved the voice actors too, they did a great job! 



random side note i also LOVED the island of iki story, i ended up over there half way thru the game and it was so fun and difficult and such a cool break from the main storyline. i wish there had been another mini island or two like that. 



overall the game was an 8/10 for me. beautiful game and i’m glad i played it. not a perfect game like many claim, but i guess that’s all subjective anyways. i would totally recommend and hope to see a sequel! 
    to add (lol) : they are called mythic tales!


i also forgot to say i liked the wind guiding you to quest markers, that was a very nice touch 


and the basically no loading time between fast travel and cut scene was dope! 


i feel like i dogged the game a bit in my review haha i really did love it tho!! 
just frustrated because i few tweaks could have made it really epic! but it’ll be up there for me <3
In my top 5 games of all time
I absolutely hated this game. It did not need to be a boring mediocre open world game when it could’ve been a good linear experience. 

To me, it’s another victim to the witcherification of games. Every game now has to be an open world rpg-lite game full of meh side quests a la witcher 3


The last three AC’s, Mass Effect Andromeda, Ghost of Tsushima, Shadow of War, both Horizon games, Hogwarts Legacy, etc etc. Excluding the one or two core features that separate them, these games are essentially the same, you’ve played one, you’ve played them all.
    Except the witcher 3 has some of the best side quests in the business. Some of my absute favourite moments in the game came from side quests.
        Yes I agree, I mean that every game afterwards that tried to copy the winning formula has failed spectacularly in that regard, instead of well developed and thought out side quests (Witcher 3) you end up with fetch quests (AC for example).
            I agree. Everytime I want to try out the side quests in subsequent games. It's just some random ass fetch quests.

The Witcher 3 is honestly the ideal version of the ubisoft formula. At its core, it's nothing innovative in that regards, but gets carried by the strength of its absolute stellar writing. And despite its abundant criticisms, cyberpunk works for me just because of that. The atmosphere and the quality of writing made it into one of my favourite games. But there's nothing more in it beyond that.
Some people like big open world games. Others not so much. Personally, I absolutely love GoT and find it one of the better open worlds in the last few years. But in the end it IS an open world game and thus will come with those open world tropes.
    Open world doesn't mean repetitive enemy camps, garbage sidequests and copy paste shrines to find. Some games do an open world incredibly well. 

RDR 2 has a unique feeling open world - you have dozens and dozens of unique sites to find and sketch down in your notebook. Crashed gliders, hobbit house, manbearpig cabin, native burial ground, tiny church in the swamp, etc. All of them fascinating to find. 

Aside from those there are the random events in each town or the outskirts. Like the peeping tom in strawberry who gets started when you approach and if you peek in the window after him a woman starts yelling at you, or the 'vampire' encounter in st denis, or the wolfman running with his pack up north. 

Sidequests are unique and memorable, all of them. 

It's not hard to do, it just needs effort and care instead of following a tired formula and relying on graphics and combat only.
        I think the sidequests in GoT were passable to good. The good ones leaned more on understated emotion than outward quirkiness, and you got back however much you invested in. Finding the murdered woman/child in the river, dealing with your old servant and her failing memory and implied romance, the entire arc with your old teacher and his new student, even the quick ones like investigating the haunted woods were nicely atmospheric if you let them be. The only ones I really didn't care for were in the monks arc.
            ToC?
                GoT, bad autocorrect
        Hold on while I ride my horse throuhg pretty but empty areas to draw a picture. Activity may be different but the concept is the same.
            Rdr2 is probably the most boring open world I've ever played tbh all people talk about is "but the detail, the DETAILS!!!!" but other than that its pretty weak game overall. Tacked on survival mechanics when resources aren't even scarce. Make you move at an almost glacial pace because the game probably couldn't handle moving quickly through it because of all the "detail". Main story is full of unnecessary missions so story also moves at a glacial pace. They put in all the detail and forgot to make it fun.
    This has nothing to do with it being open world, but how the open world is made. You’ve already received good replies on that point
As someone who’s constantly chasing video game novelty and innovation, you articulated so well why this game was so meh for me. Yes, it’s gorgeous, Jesus, we get it. But I was baffled by how many GOTY noms it got. I found it to be very mid.
I think I agree with the entirety of your post. 

Through the first major area I was thinking it was one of the best games I’d ever played. Lost interest shortly after the 2nd area opened up. Haven’t gone back to the game since that first few weeks I played it, about a year ago.
Hot Springs disappointed me because I thought I would learn things about Jin and his backstory when reflecting on stuff. But nope, just a few lines about something that already happened in the game
Reading posts like this, I'm starting to think gamers are really getting spoiled. I genuinely don't understand what some of you want sometimes.

I platinumed Ghost of Tsushima and only felt a *very mild* sense of repetitiveness toward the very end. Which, I'd say, is completely normal in a completionist run.

Do some elements repeat themselves? Of course, it's a game. It's not going to have 60 hours of unique, one-of-a-kind encounters. But I never felt it got stale. The smooth combat system, haptic feedback, and beautifully crafted world made sure of that. Hell, long after beating it, I'd sometimes boot it up to just walk around or slice some folks.

Jin's personality and the story are very in line with the setting. Yeah, he's not Ezio or Nathan Drake or anything, but he's not supposed to be. Dry, somewhat stuck up and conflicted is exactly what he's supposed to be. And considering the entire game is about fighting a Mongol invasion, I never considered it weird all activities revolved around killing Mongols.

I essentially disagree with everything in this post except the tailing missions. Because yeah, fuck tailing missions.
    I’m happy you enjoyed the game as much as you did. I disagree about about gamers being spoiled. In fact I think AAA game devs are getting complacent. Some of the mechanics are really old and weren’t that great to begin with. Killing animals to increase ammo capacity, clearing enemy camps to unlock a new part of the map. A big empty world to take you from one question mark to the next. I want some innovation and risk taking. 

And when making these big open worlds, either focus on making exploration exciting (Elden Ring, BOTW) or give me a fleshed out world I can interact with (RDR2). Ghost does neither.
        I completely agree that AAA game devs are getting complacent. And I mean... makes sense. Gaming has become a massive, lucrative market, and that naturally discourages risk-taking. You become formulaic and play it safe to rake in the big bucks. Nobody wants to take a gamble on a multi-million dollar project. I don't like it, but I get it. 

I just don't think Ghost of Tsushima is an example of that. I'd argue exploration was exciting because of how beautiful the world was. Combat was smooth and felt impactful. Open world "collectibles" were implemented in a charming way and didn't feel excessive or repetitive. 

Sure, the game didn't introduce anything groundbreaking to the genre - by definition, very few titles can do that. But it was a very fresh, pleasant take on already existing elements IMO. Definitely wouldn't go so far as to call it dull.
            I agree with you. And I get it that these companies don’t want to take risks. And why should they when the formula was created 15 years ago, and people still love it. 

Were we disagree is about wether it’s worth it to explore the beautiful world or not. Personally I didn’t after a while, but I can easily understand why many did
                Yeah at some point, it's just a matter of taste. I enjoyed the hell out of it, but people like different things.
    It's FOMO.

When someone plays a game that's critically acclaimed and it turns out it's not the right game for them or isn't exactly what they would have wanted they must write a whole essay letting out their frustrations to anyone who will listen.

Like, what's even the point? Why not just move on instead of trying to convince everyone this game is shit? It's not going to change yours or anyone else's opinion on the game. All it will lead to is a pointless argument or circlejerk.
*Big open worlds, but nothing to explore...because we filled it in already with markers and collectibles before you even look at the map....*  
It is like developers forgot what exploration is supposed to be about. It was the reason why I wanted big open world games like Morrowind, and then they went ahead and spoiled all that.
I disagree but to each their own 😂
My favourite part of Ghost of Tsushima is when Jin in fully upgraded plate armour with a steel helmet gets knocked out by a guy with a stick. Also the ludonarrative dissonance in the early game especially is hilarious, you can go round stealing everything that isn't nailed down and cutting throats from the shadows left and right but Jin will cry about doing those very same things in every other cutscene for a good chunk of the first act. 

And I agree about the side content being super repetitive, nearly every side quest is structured identically and most of them (about 90%, I 100% the game) end on the depressing note of the quest giver or their families dying. The rewards for doing them are shit just as often too. 

It's a fine game but no where near the "game of the year" so many praised it as being. With a shit story and side content all it really has to go on is decent combat and a beautiful setting, two things the more recent Assassin's Creed games also have going for them but people love to hate.
    So do you think the newer assassin's creeds are worthwhile? I've considered trying one out, but there are so many mixed opinions and people saying they're just bloated and not worth the investment that I'm hesitant to jump in.
        I've honestly not played them but watched friends play quite a bit on Discord, the consensus among them is that Origins is worth it and quite good but don't expect traditional AC, Odyssey is ok but the side content isn't good and essentially mandatory due to level locked main quests and Valhalla can be fun but is so insanely long it drags quite a lot, it also looked really glitchy when I watched them play. Based on what I've seen and what they all said I'd give Origins a go, you can pick it up for really cheap
It's a good game that would have been great if it wasn't an open world. I don't know why developers nowadays seem so fixated on making every possible game an open world.
    It sells. If ghost was a linear main story campaign with 5 enemy types way less people would have bought it.
        Would they though? TLOU Part 2 won GOTY against GoT and it is a pretty linear game. It just focuses on the story and experience instead of wasting resources on a pretty but empty world.
            Its very rare for a linear game story to be as good as the last of us or god of war though and ghost of tushima definitely wasn't as good. THe island of tushima being fully explorable mkaes snese and having tons of samurai tales in it was to the games benefit since that is pretty unique in open world games.
    [deleted]
        Yeah, it makes sense that with rising price tags that developers would try to bloat games' length, but I think there's other ways to do so. TLOU Part 2 campaign is just as long or even longer than GoT and it does so without a boring open world. Games like Devil May Cry have even shorter campaigns but they have a lot of replayability due to skillful gameplay. Hopefully after Elden Ring developers realize how open world games should be and stop trying to turn every game into one of them.
I always felt that the game should have mix & match abilities that can be universally used no matter what outfit you wore. I love the traveler attire, but it's special perk is kinda lame. The Ghost armor has a cool perk, but it looks meh. 

It would be nice to apply perks of your choice to any/all attire.
    The charms system is a mess. I had several of the exact same ones. And what do they do exactly? Sometimes the information is oddly specific (7,5 % quicker arrow reload) and other times I’m just guessing. «Moderate amount of damage reduction» I wouldn’t mind either one, but combined it’s weird
This game really highlighted why I can't trust hype and awards/ nominations. It was beautiful and for the most part I enjoyed it. But at no point while playing it did anything stand out that would make it GOTY. It felt like a generic open world game where just a few things had been tweaked to make you think it was doing something different. I'm convinced that if it didn't look so good (and it really does look amazing at times) it wouldn't have received anywhere near the level of praise it did.
    The reviews are very good, but not over the moon. What really surprise me is how high the user scores are. I’m happy for them, but it’s very surprising to me
        Yeah I was definitely surprised by how positive user scores were given what I experienced. It was the user scores and reports that led to me wanting to play it in the first place. After finishing it I had to double back and check if I'd just missed something in their discussions that might have mentioned the problems I had with the game. And while there definitely were some posts like yours that highlighted the problems, the overwhelming majority were singing its praise and nothing else. So many people were even praising it for the exact things that I had a problem with. 

Combat in particular seemed to receive a weird amount of praise for a system that I felt was tediously boring towards the end. Although I might have myself to blame on that front as I played GoT immediately after completing Sekiro and I think I couldn't help but compare one sword based combat system to the other while playing.

But I wish I'd had the experience that many seem to have. Although I enjoyed it, the game was mostly forgettable for me.
The more I played this game, the less I enjoyed it until I gave up in the middle of Act II. And I could never put my finger on why, exactly, I disliked it because it feels like in every way a game I should like. It's a good game, and I'd never say otherwise, but I think dull describes the general feeling I had about it. I love graphics, and the environment design was beautiful, but that's most AAA games nowadays, admittedly. It's not a super huge selling point for me. 

The most annoying thing was how if you got hit too much using the "wrong" stance the game would pause and force you to change stances. I didn't want to use a different stance, and generally I do not mind getting hit, so I would change stances just to change back to the one that felt better to play. 

It's weird. Good game, but very much not for me.
Something that was obvious to me simply by watching a bit of gameplay footage. I never understood the hype around that game from Sony fanboys. But then again they were also hyped for Forspoken and that wasn't even a Sony exclusive lol
I couldn't agree more with everything you said. Summed up my feelings on it perfectly.  If it gets a sequel I hope they improve on some of its flaws. I feel like the should look at Geralt, who's a perfect stern protagonist, but he's not a robot, you really get a feel for the guy and even though he's supposed to be this emotionless killing machine you can feel the humanity in him. Didnt feel that with Jin.
One of the only open world games I never completed. I was bored out of my mind.
I've been toying with writing this exact review for a few weeks now! 

I'm glad people got massive enjoyment out of the game but I found it extremely dull after about 10-12 hours.
It got very close to a great game but ultimately failed and can only be described as a decent game, with extremely high production value.

Like everyone said it'd be a much better game if it has a tighter mainline story and a little more urgency. 

My biggest problem is the combat. It's fun and a good challenge on higher difficulties, but it's too rigid, particularly around the stances. Then the Walmart of gadgets, moves and secondary weapons. They really should make everything more fluid then streamline. Like I have three separate quick selection wheels that sometimes require you to switch on the fly. It's just too much micromanaging rather than doing the actual gaming.
Welcome to modern gaming.
This seems to be a big problem with most 3rd person action/adventure games. They have great presentation and hook but way too much filler (GoW, Middle Earth games, any Assassins Creed game)

I think this is largely due to the growing casual fanbase, especially around consoles, valuing presentation over mechanics. 
I find these games to be an absolute chore to play after the first few hours and it reminds me of the days of cookie clicker lol

Maybe I'm just cynical, but it's crazy that these games are called masterpieces when I find them all to be pretty similar these days. I also am amazed the 30+ hour campaign is still accepted these days. More is definitely not always better
I hate the GOT slander. I love this game.

OP YOU caused many of the issues you have with this game. 

I can only assume you were rushing? While playing it or something, by the way you say you “avoid fox dens like the plague” after you thought you’d gotten everything you could from them. 

There’s more than just 5 enemies as well. Double swords guy, ronin, and at least two kinds of big boys as well as all the variations like flaming sword and shield. As you play they learn new attacks too. 

I’m also super confused by “this side content makes exploration worthless” like, what? That is the exploration mostly? That’s like saying “I hate eating oatmeal because it makes breakfast worthless” and there is stuff beyond the question marks. You obviously missed all of the hidden stuff if you’re saying something like that. 

OP you need to meditate, maybe Write some haikus and learn patience and restraint. You fought against many aspects of this game and then wondered why it wasn’t fun.
    There’s no slander. Just a civilized discussion about the game. 

How did I cause my own issues? And why do you assume I was rushing? I was not. 

If you enjoyed the 50 fox den’s, that’s good for you. I think you’re probably in the minority. 

I’m talking about exploring outside the icon’s on the map. I won’t find a cool armor set or a new weapon by exploring. Looking for gold to upgrade your katana? There is none outside enemy camps

I didn’t fight against anything. Just sharing my opinion
        Ok but you’re just straight up wrong about many of these things. That’s the slander. 

You get powerful upgraded charms from completing all fox dens. 

You get to see some of the neatest little things in the game if you look for the hidden things that aren’t on the maps icons, for instance, places where you can bow to nature spirits and see things like a swarm of hundreds of fish jumping out of the water. 

Finding crickets gives you access to new songs which allow you to CONTROL THE WEATHER. This is told to you outright by a tutorial and you still missed it. 

Many of these things are gently pointed out to you by lightening bugs. I doubt you followed any lightening bugs. 

And yes the world will seem pretty flat and dead if you don’t read any of the writing you find, where you will learn about people’s lives and trials and what they love and lost. 

You were rushing and choosing not to interact with the world you already decided was worthless, whether you want to believe it or not.
            Here is the thing, i platinumed the game. I read through all the scrolls and item descriptions. I interacted with crickets, foxes etc.

BUT ALL OF IT US JUST BORING, ITS ALL BORING BUSY WORK. I wouldn't have done any of it if i wasn't going for platinum.
            If all I get for completing all the fox den’s are powerful charms, then I’m really happy that I stopped. 

I didn’t miss the cricket stuff, but I never went to look for them. So you’re right in that regard. Saying I rushed the game is just flat out wrong tho. Not everyone are completionists and trophy hunters. I did most of the content the game had to offer
                I’m not a completionist lol. I just like petting the foxes and making frogs dance.
                    I liked petting the foxes too, but I was good after about 20
When it comes down to it, most open world games are pretty repetitive. But for me, this game had the kind of repetition that I actually enjoyed. Broken up with beautiful landscape and incredibly soothing environments. And a feeling like there wasn’t really that much moral ambiguity with your actions. What you were doing really matters to people, and you were quite literally saving the world.
Ghost of Tsushima is the best game i’ve ever played. I completey disagree with your points.

How can you say enemies are repetitive and theres only 5 types of enemies when DUH it is based on MONGOLS and is a REALISTIC game. What did you expect ? An egyptian God to fight like in AC games?

that single argument itself showed your arguments as silly and what the game is about went completely over your head.

I’ve had insane fun trying to master the fights with those "Same enemies" in a literal story about Mongols invading Japan in duels, to stance fighting, to group camp fighting, to standoffs etc.

Now you go and play the nth AC game where it has this VarIeTy of EnEmIeS and play ur egyptian gods or greek gods who are flying in the air or whatever. and leave the ones that are actually GREAT and realistic like Ghost of Tsushima to us. you silly goose.
You are wrong, and that's okay. It's okay to be wrong. God bless you. \*kiss\*
I come back to it every few months.  "Why didn't I like this game?"  Then I abandon it after 3 hours.
All my friends shamed me when I said the same thing. It gets to a point where you play so many open world games that you start to see which games do it right and which ganes do it wrong. Couldn’t finish GoT. Graphics were amazing and they did that place justice.
Well written. As someone who platinumed the game and reflecting back on my experience you are so right. I don’t know why I kept playing well after I was done with the game but my only thinking is that there must have been something there that made it fun but yeah really really don’t want them making a sequel and just iterating a bit would much rather a new thing. I loved infamous and sly cooper and I’ll certainly play the sequel but probably will wait for a long time until it’s free essentially via ps plus. It could be cool if they adopted more breath of the wild legs of exploration I.e. ignore map and just explore but these games aren’t really built for that. For example I recall doing an entire Mongol camp for like 30-40 mins and I got no reward cause it was part of a side quest that I hadn’t officially started so I had to do again. Maybe they patched that but I played it like a year after release. Really discouraged me exploring that way again
I feel the same. Played it twice and gave up both times.
Ya this game a big letdown and might have been better if it was more linear.
It's a good game with a beautiful open world that is trapped in a shitty, bloated open world game.
I agree with most of this, they just should have fully committed to a linear experience. If the game ditched the open world it could have been perfect
[deleted]
    And I didn’t. I tried everything (which I think you should do) and then stopped doing the things I enjoyed the least
And there are so many formulaic quests with tracking… it seems so obvious they took it 1:1 from Witcher 3. Only in the Witcher it made all sense trying to uncover what kind of monster could have possibly done this or that. Here Jin Sakai tries to be Jin Holmes so hard and it’s really annoying.
I thought GoT was basically Assassin's Creed but much, much worse across the board.  No surprise there, Sucker Punch flat out sucks at making games.  Their games are shallow generic borefests.
In retrospect, it comes close to absolute greatness, while not quite reaching there.

It feels like a glorified Assassin's Creed game, for better or worse. The game does get repetitive and could be paced better. If I recall, the Infamous games had a similar problem too. I'd still recommend it to anyone interested in Creed type games or into feudal Japan.
    Totally. It’s not bad, it just could have been a lot better imo
Sorry. But duh? Did you not know you were buying an obvious Obisoft redskin?
It's a walking simulator. More than half your playing time will be spent walking and horse riding while conversing with an NPC.
I think it's just a matter of the release window. 10 years ago this would have been lauded as packed with content because we were all less critical and less used to the formulaic open worlds out there.

It really is only Red Dead that comes to mind as an open world that tried to show us what the optimal scenario is without compromising on immersion. In that game I often find myself not looking at maps or markers but just riding around taking in the scenary. In Tsushima I never veer off the path towards a marker. There's no reason to after the visuals have lost their wow-factor - because it becomes shallow when it's surface deep
The thing that kept me going was the art direction. Every area you went to had some charm to it, some character that made me go “holy shit, I’d just build a house here and live forever.” At the end of the day, yes it’s not as groundbreaking as people made it out to be, but I’d score it a solid 8/10 and I’m very excited to see how the sequel develops the ideas of the first game.
This is how I feel as well. Honestly in a sea of open world games this one to me has the most potential if they had just turned it into a narrative linear game instead.
I think the fights and 1 on 1 duels are fantastic. The assasin creed template of going into bandit camps got old super fast, but the game was a lot of fun
My first play through it was super fun 

My second play through, I only got as far as the dlc and enjoyed that but couldn’t really continue with the main story it’s a great story but not something that is super fun the second time through.
I felt very similar about the game, even though I also thought that combat overstayed it's welcome. Sekiro light does flow well but I found myself avoiding enemies like the plague towards the end because I had enough of the combat.

That said, the dlc showcases how to address some of these issues. First off, the story is ok, but I really enjoyed the emotional impact of the main quest and the dlc rings a bit hollow after (even though it gets better). However, dlc charms can actually change how mechanics behave (i.e.smart targeting archery) which is really fun. New armors lean into this too. More importantly, new enemy types can switch weapons on the fly and are much more aggressive, while others are buff mobs that should be prioritized. Good ideas all! Will it rejuvenate your desire to play? Probably not. But I think it shows that they had an idea on how to improve core areas of the game, good ideas at that. Looking forward to the sequel!
I like to think of GoT as a concentrated Assassin's Creed game. Less jank, less parkour, and all that but better production and atmosphere.   


Seriously, just watching the duels on Youtube is out of this world - the tension from samurai flicks is perfectly captured.
Uhm, acshually, there are nine enemies. You forgot about double swords guy, masked bomb-throwing knife guy, doggy, and bear, so there. 🤓 

I'm currently replaying the game on PS5 after originally playing through it on PS4, because I want to give the DLC a try. I put the difficulty on Lethal to have at least somewhat of a challenge, since the game is way too easy otherwise. I agree with most of what you say, especially in terms of Jin. He's so boring.
you could argue repetition and cyclical-ness is part of the whole Buddhism vibe lol. never dull though, the world was too beautiful
I agree broadly, but I was just in the right headspace for wandering about in a pretty environment so I enjoyed it well enough. I'll never play it again though.
Yeah this kind of bloating can really take the pace out of a game.

I'm playing through AC origins now and feel the same. The game didn't need a level system and requirement to do side quests to be strong enough for the next part of the story.
GoT is one of my favorites, but your point is definitely valid. I think a lot of games suffer from having something that makes it not enjoyable to others, whether it's the story, enemy variations, gameplay, or even graphics.

Some games that come to mind when thinking about goty-level games but with understandable critiques are Breath of the Wild's lack of enemies and Wither 3's fighting gameplay. I also love them both, but the critiques are very much valid.
This is how I feel about god of war 2018
I generally loved Ghost of Tsushima as a linear story but gave up on side content pretty quickly when I realised just how much of the world is just the same assets copied and pasted everywhere. The third time I walked into a house with an identical layout to one I'd been in before I knew the side content wasn't worth it
Can we talk about the multiplayer mode though?

Not as relevant for the patient gamer (unfortunately), but wow was that mode an incredibly fun and inventive experience. The survival modes did eventually feel a bit grindy, but the raids were definitely a compelling experience (especially if you went in blind).

I think having the ability to mix sessions of the single player with the multiplayer really helped round out the experience compared to just mainlining the single player.
I always felt like the game was the Assassins Creed 1 of the setting. I loved so much about the game but the repetitiveness was its main drawback.

Would absolutely play a sequel that expanded on those elements.

The atmosphere was fantastic in the game.
Completely agree regarding the empty open world. I played GoT straight after playing Red dead redemption 2, probably the best open world experiences you can have, and the contrast hit like a ton of bricks. Scenery was beautiful but there was just no reason to explore it.
I kind of liked that Jin was boring, it allowed the player to project his personality any way they wanted

I only stuck with the big character driven side quests and the main plot.  I ended up really enjoying the characters in the story.
It's probably the most beautiful game I've ever seen. Simply gorgeous. 

But I agree with you that gameplay was a bit dull, with way too many Mongol camps. I enjoyed finishing the first island, and did a lot of the side-quests, and then I discovered that there was a SECOND island with more of the same and kind of gave up :(
I played this game maybe a year after its release. Wasn't particularly attracted to the setting or story. What really grabbed me is the gameplay.

Then I fell in love with the setting.

And until 2/3 of the game the story didn't click at all. But then a story beat really clicked with me.

I went from "this game is fun nothing less nothing more" to "I really love this game".

I have to say that when I play an open world game filled with side content, if I'm not totally in love with the game, I'll only do the side things I want, I don't care about clearing the map or my quest log. So I upgraded my character as much as I could but mainlined the story. Barely did any side character quest.

The game stayed fun and non repetitive because of that. If I feel the burnout I just go on with the main story. Can't speak for everyone but to me every openworld gets repetitive and boring, that comes with this style of games. Not saying your critics are not valid, but maybe if you feel like this, don't force yourself to do everything or most of the things. My philosophy is that if after the.main quest I still crave more of the game, I can go on and clear all that's left until I'm satisfied.

For GoT, I was satisfied after the credits rolled. Still got a lot of hours out of a game that didn't vibe with me with trailers etc.
I dropped after 4 hours.

It wasn't the monotony that killed it for me, it was the overly serious"samurai Honor" weeb Kurosawa-jerking bullshit tone. It was way way too self serious.

Sekiro and Nioh's tone were both lighter.
I agree with most of this although I’m maybe not as disappointed by it all. It is Open WorldTM game without a doubt and I did get burnt out. The story isn’t particularly compelling, the combat isn’t compelling etc. The duels are really where the gameplay shines and I enjoyed the hell out of those. That should have been the major focus of the game. Otherwise it’s a very competent and good looking game to check off boxes.

I think the biggest issue I actually had with it was the story. They should have given us the option, as we have in every combat in the open world, to be “honourable” or “dishonourable.” When you are forced to do whatever nefarious act of mass murder in a main story mission and are subsequently chastised for it, that doesn’t feel good. It wasn’t my choice to begin with. 

All the outposts are absolutely trivial as well. Once you get explosives you really just gotta run around and collect everyone and then blow them up. Everything else is inefficient.
I’ve been playing The Outer Worlds mainly alongside Ghost of Tsushima.

The odd thing is that on paper I’d much prefer the setting of the latter, but it’s Obsidian’s game for me that I’ve had more of an inclination to keep going back to - despite typically not being that keen on the sci fi type settings.

A typical side quest in Ghost has like 9 steps to it.  In fact I’ve still got some left over from the very beginning at like step 7 as do it all at once and it’ll drag on.  All from the same quest giver as well, which doesn’t exactly help with the immersion as they’re somehow in 3 places at once.

The Outer Worlds it’s more like 3 steps, but you’ve got like 3-4 different options for how to resolve it. Skill check, skill check, find something for special dialogue, or just kill everything/one.  Makes it so much better.
This is not just an issue with GoT.  It's an issue with the majority of open world games.
    That’s true. There are also open world games that are a lot better and more fun than GoT
Yeah that sound about right...you clearly have more patience than me for this game...I spend about 10/12 hours playing it and I just didn't bother anymore.
Agree with all of this, the game felt mostly like missed opportunities. The non-required stealth play was decently fun, I liked the combat in the early going, and of course it is STUNNING to look at. I decided to make it my drunk/high game, since I can play it basically in my sleep. Perfect for late night sessions and not caring how long it takes to beat
I found that game also made me save scum a ton because of how much it wants you to perfectly use stealth in basically all situations. Turned it into a huge time sink and like you said became very repetitive.
Mr friend loved the game, so I tried it but the combat just didn’t click with me and it got repetitive fast. So I quit
I agree with this 100%. I enjoyed the game, but would find myself bored after an hour or so, and so i would switch to something else. 

Took me a really long time to get to the end, and I certainly didn't hate it, but it just didn't grab me in the way I expected it to. I think you've pretty much hit the nail on the head in why I felt that way.
To each his own, but this is my favorite game of all time, and I've been gaming for 20 yrs. It does open world in a minimalist fashion while having the best combat gameplay-parry I've seen in any Assassin's Creed type game.

10/10 Graphics
10/10 Gameplay
10/10 Story

Honestly a masterpiece of a video game, highly recommmend.
Did you play it on hardest difficulty?
    I tried playing on lethal. It was fine, but combat itself was never my issue
Think you might have been a bit tired of other and or had a bunch of other games waiting to be played, when I bought this game i played it and enjoyed every second of it

It was everything I expected it to be a beautiful Japanese samurai story with cinematography, combat and culture as their main focus
    No. I had all the time in the world and really wanted to love it
        Alright it seems you really tried haha
Ghost of Tsushima is a story game. You’re meant to play the campaign and embrace the story and is characters. It’s not farcry or a Bethesda game where exploration and grinding are a part of it. 

Sure, some of the open world elements can get repetitive, but those are all extra the developers put in to give content. Not put in to shape your experience. 

There aren’t a ton of different enemy types but again, it’s a story focused game not a souls game. An invading army wouldn’t have 40 different soldier types, especially in the context of this time setting so it would be weird to the story to ignore that. The sword play is so good and they give so many other options to take enemies out that if you’re bored with combat, it’s because you’ve restricted yourself. 

I love this game. I love that the devs stuck to the vibe and didn’t try to make a game that fit everyone’s niche. We need more of that in this bland lifeless landscape that aaa gaming is becoming
    It might be a story game, but a lot of us didn’t think the story or the characters were that great unfortunately. Side content and side quests shouldn’t shape your experience in a video game?
        I think you look at the characters too superficially unfortunately. You see jin as a guy with a stick up his ass but ignore the context of his upbringing literally forcing him to be that stoic person we see. Samurai are not charismatic boisterous people. That was considered low brow and dishonorable. 

I already said it once, but I really really love how the devs stuck to the vibe so well and created a story that is true to itself
            I’m not ignoring his upbringing, but I wished we would see more of his personality, and dialogue that explored other stuff. Jin should have more layers than the game is showing us
Agree fully. Never finished it, it’s the best of the Ubisoft style open worlds but man it brought nothing new to the table and I burnt out on it pretty quick. 

Great game, absolutely gorgeous game, but nothing I haven’t already played before.

GoT would have been exceptional if it were a more focused experience. Less open world bull shit, less *stuff*.
Truly thought i was the only one who didn’t fawn over this game. I really didn’t get the hype
Ghost of Tsushima and Horizon Zero Dawn/Forbidden west have this " ubisoft" style in their gameplay, but unlike Ubisoft the games have a good story and are fully playable from beggining to end. But once you see through the mask of the narrative focus you see that they are games meant to be like " go there and kill this enemy camp using high grass as stealth, to get there you can climb some mountains with obviously marked climbing spots while watching a gorgeus scenery to keep your mind out of the repetitive pattern" 

&#x200B;

Good games, but you wouldn't catch me trying to 100% them because there really is no point.
You... might need to increase the difficulty level a bit.
I got through half the game then the update with the Lethal difficulty came out, now that keeps the game interesting. Actually forces you to be very creative in fights using all your tools.
>My biggest mistake was going 100% on the first region and then totally burning out on subsequent regions.

i saw this coming luckly and stopped doing that when i noticed its always the same 4 situations
Is it worth playing if you ignore the multitude of ? points on the map and just mainline the story?
    A lot of people love it. I’d say yes just because I’m in the minority when it comes to this game
I think I *would* have agreed with everything you said, but I played the game on lethal difficulty, which I think fixed a lot of these problems for me. I mean yeah, there's not great enemy variety, but you really have to keep your guard up, and it never stops feeling awesome when you get the hang of it
How i feel about most AAA games the last few years
yeah exactly why stop playing it, reaching the second part
I'm in the middle of playing this now. I'm enjoying it, but I definitely feel the shine wearing off and I'm already feeling myself ready to just do the significant side quests and main story. But also, I think the only open world games I've played are Skyrim and Zelda BOTW, so the gameplay loop hasn't been played to death for me yet. And after this, I probably won't play another open world game for a good while because it is a genre that's best in small doses imo.
I feel you. I couldn't put more than 10 hours in the game, it became repetitive and  boring after that. Personally I find the battle stances boring as well, what is even their purpose for me they don't make the combat more interesting. The game was beautiful yes, but I prefer ugly game with a good game loop and story than super beautiful but empty world with a basic story
I'm having this problem with virtually any modern open world game. Even if the atmosphere is nailed, and vertical slice of gameplay is great, there's always just too much rehash and thin writing surrounding it.

Feel practically every game suffers from this. Even the lauded Elden Ring and BotW. They just do in varying degrees. I seem to just call it a day 20-60% in (based on how much rehashing there is) and move on. 

Wish to fuck these games could just be more compact if they can't be clever enough to make their scope work for them.
Like with most ubisoft titles, if you beeline the main story (and maybe do the legendary weapon/armor quests) you'll get a much more focused experience.  I really enjoyed it, but it did noticeably drop off in the third act.
Side rant on the stealth section, but its the reason why I get annoyed whenever Assassin Creed being set in Japan gets bring up in discussions on reddit, you get people saying "But we already got an AC in Japan and thats GoT!" 

Like yeah no. GoT is an great well-made game, but its stealth mechanics doesn't come close to how good classic AC's, and heck even the open world RPGs AC, stealth mechanics are. God's stealth felt was way too restricted and less mobile compare to AC's that I don't see it as an better version of AC outside of story, polish, and the fact that we don't have an hub that takes up half the screen.
I had the same thoughts in the beggining. Then it grew on me. The only game in my life I felt the need to play again. Also weed helps.
This is what happens with every open world game. There are now so many of them that they get boring unless they have something unique and fun to do.
Main thing I appreciated from the game was the stealth admidst a near endless stealth game drought around then. It's not an upserdly popular game type but glad to see some attempts to tackle it. Plus the integration of the wind to help keep me immersed is really clever game design that I like other games are following in implementation somewhat.
open world games make me zzz
My biggest issue was that after liberating a settlement or driving out the Mongols the locals didn’t rebuild the wrecked villages
It’s close to an Ubisoft game in that regard. A bit dull indeed.
I think it was the perfect game for me during lockdown, mostly because I couldn’t get out for long stretches at a time.  I enjoyed the scenery in this and Far Cry 5….but both suffered your listed issues on gameplay.

I upvoted your nuanced disappointment at a game I loved.  Thanks for the well thought out post!
It seems to me you are rushing to 100%, I think people have the wrong idea about these games, it's supposed to played casually, it's a vast world, if your attention can't hold on to the game's methods, then I would take a break, if you're not enjoying it, don't play it. I know it's easier said than done but you can't run to 100% and expect it to be fun, I think a lot of people have the wrong idea when I get comes to games like this. AC games clicked in my head ages ago, they are just casual games with a AAA team behind it. Same can be said for the witcher 3, the story is no more than 10 hours however the rest of the game content is more than 170hrs alone. My advice is just take your time, is something else on your mind? Maybe focus on that. It's just games in the end. Your time is something you can never take back.
Buys an open world game. 

Complains that it plays like every other open world game.
    This is just wrong. There are great open world games, and poor design choices shouldn’t be excused with «well it’s open world»

«All» AAA games are open world. But not all open world games are the same
        Can you name an open world game that has tons of unique content and doesn't rely on the standard formula?
            What do you mean by unique content and standard formula?
I personally loved the entire game, but i totally understand why you are disappointed
U can say the same for most Playstation games, horizon 1 and 2, GOW, GOT, TLOU. Stellar presentation, average gameplay and hit or miss story.

I too bought this game because of hype. But except the setting, it felt like a generic ubisoft open world game.

I just always think, sony games should come under more scrutiny from its design pov, but they get a pass because of presentation, while arguably better games with worse graphics gets critisized as hell.
    Horizon games are very similar, but I think both GOW and TLOU are very different and not comparable to this one
        The skill trees, the constant talking. Its the whole sony formula which i m just so tired. I completed GOW Ragnarok and found it very bloated and unfocused and i loved 2018.

I just think its the sony games as a whole which feel so by the numbers, like marvel movies. Playing some indies to have a bit of refresh.
            Yeah I’ll be very interested to see where they go next
It's a game you enjoy more for the graphics than anything. Typical Sony running around in the forest game
I enjoyed the combat so much that I didn't mind that the game gave me more reasons to engage with it. I guess if you just see it as spamming the attack button (I feel like enemies would parry/block you pretty often to do that?) the whole game falls apart because that's more or less the *core* of the game (the minute to minute gameplay)

It's like if you don't find the movement and jumping fun in a mario game you're probably not going to enjoy the rest of it no matter how many powerups or whatever they give you. Changing the context isn't going to change the core gameplay so if you're not into it all the rest is just going to feel like a slog.
Started it a few weeks ago and completely agree. It didn't add anything new to the open world genre for me - the game design felt a bit like Far Cry 3. It looked amazing though for sure.
Still Wait for it to port to Pc
I loved the game. The Legends mode could’ve been so good if they kept developing it. It was a blast with some friends.
On the note of combat feeling boring, I'm curious how people's thoughts about combat corelate to the difficulty they play at. I'm playing on the highest difficulty (Lethal, I think), and it still feels really fun and satisfying to me, like 50 hours in.

Sure the stances are really rock-paper-scissorsy, but each stance plays completely differently due to the timing of the animations and the behavior of the enemies. Then when I've got like 3 different enemy types all attacking me at the same time, I have to juggle all these playstyles at the same time while doing my best to never get hit. That all probably only matters, though, because of the Lethal difficulty. Myself and enemies doing more damage to each other means I can't afford getting hit more than a couple times, so I have to be super careful and intentional about how I fight. However, if I'm careful and deliberate, I know I can down most enemies in just a couple blows. It adds a lot of stakes to the juggling I mentioned before.

Not gonna defend the game if the only way that combat is fun is if you play with the hardest difficulty. If that's the case, it isn't very accessible **and** it means the majority of your players are playing the most boring form of combat. IMO they probably should have made normal work like Lethal, and have an easy and story mode that are more forgiving.
Totally agree. I love exploring and doing side quests so by the time I got to the final region I had a very high skill (maybe I was maxed out, can’t remember) and felt like it had overall become very repetitive. As soon as I finished the story I didn’t feel like completing the other stuff to get the trophies I missed cause it all felt like the same thing over and over again
This was gonna be my next game purchase once it dropped to $20, but after this review and a few others I'm reconsidering.  The last game i purchased/played was Mad Max ($5) and once I beat the main story, the games playability dropped off a cliff.
GoT was my first PS5 game. After 5-10 hours of playing, I thought to myself "I've done this before, but in a different setting" referring to Red Dead Redemption 2.

I platinumed the base game, but lost steam playing through the expansion island. As I got close to platinum the vanilla portion felt a little tiresome towards the end. But, overall I'd say I enjoyed my experience with the game. I got my moneys worth for sure.
Made it about 2/3 through the game and burned out for many of the same reasons. Still consider this a good game though.
I loved it. It did feel repetitive especially when I got the platinum trophy for it, but the story was still amazing to me and I also enjoyed making my own little stories up as I fought endless hordes of men over and over. It was a blast overall and then I played five minutes of newgame+ and haven’t touched it since
Fully agree. I was incredibly impressed with the visuals. And I was determined to platinum it early on. But it all got so repetitive and almost a slog. The visuals kept me engaged while roaming, but the enemy encounters got so dull. I never platinumed it in the end.
Play in lethal mode and enjoy

Normal and hard mode GoT is just AC Japan

Edit: I read your post and it’s a super bad take on everything, lethal mode would not save the game for you.
I really enjoy this game, but it does have a toooon of content that gets repetitive. It is the origin of the GirlfriendReviews "holupaminute" term for a reason.
Same with the Horizon series
Yeah. I felt the same way.  That game blows
After playing Nioh I found Ghost of Tsushima impossible to get into.
Unfortunately, you summarized the game pretty well, I platinumed the game within 2-4 weeks of launch, but just beacuse I had too much time on my hands during lockdown. And the fact that LOU2 hit the market just a month before really made it hard for GOT. Don’t get me wrong ik that they are completely different games, but when you come away from such a heavy game lüke LOU2 you just need sth more than chaising foxes to fill the void, but then again it might have been a problem only for me.
A lot of open world games are becoming repetitive and sadly this is one of those games. It was amazing, AT FIRST. Then I just felt the need to stop playing and sadly I haven't returned. Yes the game is original and beautiful but it doesn't offer the excitement of The Witcher 3, Days Gone or AC Origins (which are my top 3 open world games in the last 10 years). I won't trash the game because it's amazing but just not on my level of enjoyment.
Most open world games are like this
Yeah they cut too many corners for me. Instead of animations for side quests we get those black screens with a sound effect. Failed to maintain immersion
See I agree with your points, but I still enjoy the game. I even thought at the time "These missions are just as monotonous and shit as other games I've clowned on for that thing, but for some reason I just like this enough"
You know, I had the moment where I felt this way and then I realised that I wasn't playing the game for the gameplay itself.

The acting is fantastic. The storylines for the main characters are fun and hit all the samurai movie cliche's. But most of all Tsushima is simply beautiful.

I still wander around the game sometimes to enjoy the landscapes.
the fox shrines , bamboo strikes etc should’ve been hidden without a guiding wind telling you where they were. if they truly were hard to find , i’m thinking like BoTW, it would make upgrades feel more important i guess. i really like the bamboo mini games, wish they were harder though. Also the game should’ve ended at the second castle imo. The whole game started to drag big time when i got to the north snow section of the game.
The only bad thing for me are the Repititive boss battles. It feels like I’m fighting the same person with a different skin Everytime. They do the same moves it’s j some look different and have different healthbars
I understand all those points and see why it isnt for everyone, but for me, I loved every aspect in that game, it was like a whole new world and I wish I could loose my memories to play that again

it's also the first game I've played completely blind
It kind of hurts my feelings to read your review because I don’t feel like any of your points are valid. The games core mechanics work great, and the combat system is excellent. The new skills that Jin acquired through the game make him feel more and more like a dominant force, and I felt his ghost abilities really make fighting enemies very satisfying after going through the first section of the game and him struggling with hand to hand combat. The story is ... strong. There are genuinely tear jerking moments in the game. At least three that I experienced, and each one adds to the next. His somber character completely fits the mood of the story and all he has been through and goes through. Defeat, betrayal, anger, sadness, confusion, loyalty and respect, and his eventual realisation that he has to strip himself of his culture in order to protect it. Helping villagers is small, but does a lot for the world building in the game. It might be minor and repetitive, but we are talking about a large scale invasion in the middle of a war. This is the kind of thing that you might expect to experience in this situation, he helps and saves many characters, and is sometimes betrayed and trapped by them. Sometimes he is too late. The whole game is really about him and his experiences, and I think it does a fantastic job immersing you in that world.
    I’m sorry I hurt your feelings, but it’s just an opinion about a video game. And this game seems to split opinions a lot

I agree that the combat is good, I just think it lacks enemy variety and the stance system isn’t the greatest 

I’m happy you loved the story and the tone of the game, it just didn’t click for me.
I have a different experience with the game. To be fair I have 100% the game 5 times in various ways. I have done everything there is to be done but I still come back to the game. The moment's with Taka. Shimura always still impact me. The first time I played through the castle shimura mission I understood and sympathized with Shimura and Sakai. Also jin isn't suppose to be funny. He is a practical grizzled war veteran. Who has had his entire life changed after Komoda. The first time you visit that very same beach you see in the prologue it hits like a freight train. Maybe I am boring but I still play the game and I find the combat while repetitive and sometimes annoying fun. You get to find workarounds and perfect you're techniques. I am a god at perfect parrys at this point. And the game while not changing that much and while I know every single line still is still emotional. It's the atmosphere of the game how it plays, the beautiful scenery that draws me back again and again and again. I recommend the game 100% and I do think it has it's issues. But it's a good game. that's just my view. Maybe I have the personality of stale bread but I like it.
100% with you. Looking for clues get really boring after a couple of times, especially when you take some time to find it. Also side quests where you gotta sit through the useless conversation… let me skip it ffs
Almost done with my first playthrough and man do i feel burnt out by all the sidestuff, its sad becuse im not having fun anymore and just want it to be over
100% agree with you
Correction: theres  15  enemies: Sword guy, Double Sword guy, Sword guy with armor, Sword guy with shield, Spear guy (2 variations of spears), Spear guy with armor, Big guy with sword and shield, Big guy with battleaxe, Big guy with cannon, Archer, Poison archer, Fire archer, Flashbang thrower, Bomb thrower. Also note that the appearance change means they're stronger (more health).
Finally someone keeping it real about this boring and repetitive game. Good graphics don’t make up for that.
I loved the game for what it is considering ive spent a lot of time playing AC games especially Origins Odyssey and Valhalla. Those games have way too much filler and its absolute trash. GOT was at least somewhat straight to the point. Though I could definitely agree that it could have had more variety in a few ways such as enemies and bosses for sure. The bosses could have been way better imo. There weren't any over the top absolutely insane bosses that blew you away. They were all the same cookie cutter formula. That being said the game was a solid 7.5 imo possibly a 7.9 max. It was a fun game overall beautiful scenery fun hack and slash and decent story. 
I think the story is crazy good
Same exact thing, I platinumed this game and loved almost every second of it. I almost always play games while listening to podcasts but I made myself just enjoy the atmosphere of this game. I was bored a couple times maybe, but on the whole I enjoyed it so much.
Those touches were MAGICAL for the first 10 hours. The first time I wrote a haiku was an experience that made me reevaluate how I view video games. The next 10 hours, I was getting a little impatient with the shallow characters. The next 30 hours were an absolute slog - but punctuated by an amazing ending. I just played and beat this last month, but I need some distance from it to evaluate how I really feel about it.
    The haiku in particular was a perfect use of the controller speaker.

Never had it before when the best part of a game for me has been the collectibles.
        I also liked how the haiku made you sit and APPRECIATE the view. I tend to zone out when I play and miss the vistas and I liked those segments. I did find some of the syllable choices not very appropriate and the “same” meditation song every time did wear thin
    The ending really is incredible. Why couldn't the rest of the game be that good???
    I was completely enthralled by the game. Getting off work and wanting to get home and play. I just wish they had more of a stealth setting while doing things as a ninja. Hiding in tall grass is fine and yeah I guess the ninja'ing was kinda a sub gameplay setting compared to fighting and doing things as a samurai. Even though the stealth and doing things against samurai code was a part of the game, they could of had two distinct play styles during combat and gameplay. Maybe the second one will have more.
        This is where mission design comes into play. You could totally stealth every Mongol village or take it by brute force. It would be cool, for example, completing the mission by destroying the black powder cache only with stealth, or having the enemies play defensively around the Mongol warlords. Towards the end of the game when you are collecting the Mongol armor, you had to duel each leader - it needed more of that. Maybe the enemies were the same 5 types, but they could have varied the "boss" characters to add some character and depth.
    Yea, it got old real fast after they stopped introducing new things

I still have the DLC to do and have very little desire to boot it up again
        The DLC has a dope story, and it really gets into the Sakai history, but in terms of game play it's the same ol shit
Yeah pretty much this. 

I loved the game but I’m also experiencing open world fatigue where the worlds are just too big. 

I’ve been leaning lately towards older open world games because there’s so damned much. Don’t get me wrong…it’s a gorgeous masterpiece of a game, but it’s also kind of a one and done for me.
    I still maintain two of Vice City taped together is the largest size any open world "needs" to be, and even then smaller experiences can be awesome.  Go walk around Kabukicho in the Yakuza series.  Frickin' sublime, even though you can run across the map in about 5 minutes.
        Yes I prefer a dense map to a big map. Too much traveling gets boring after a while.
What this nails for me is such games being a bit of a sandbox where you have the freedom to play the way you want, which can also define one’s enjoyment.

This game really seemed to resonate with those that just kinda chilled and enjoyed the aesthetic while organically making their way through the story.

On the other hand I’ve heard similar critique to the OP from friends but most of them were the type to burn through the game in a week or two and charge from mission to mission and focus on completion.

I don’t think either is wrong, but it definitely affects one’s enjoyment and perception imho.

I’d have likely had similar concerns if I mained it but I dipped in an out when I felt like a bit of samurai action and spent a lot of time just chilling and exploring it.

I think many gamers now binge, with finishing the game being the goal, which highlights a lot of valid criticisms when played that way, but are also vastly less noticeable or concerning if you pace it out and enjoy the journey.
I know what you mean about the perfect lockdown game. I was let go due to COVID causing financial issues for my company and spent a lot of time without a job. Jurassic World Evolution and Death Stranding were my two lockdown games. Just helping claw back a bit of a sense of accomplishment with a well designed park or quickly delivered package. I've not really been back to JWE since but during Covid it was perfect.
That's what Red Dead 2 was for me. It was almost lile bring outside.
Had the same feeling about Mad Max. Somehow repetitive but in a good way.
100%. It was my favorite game of the last few years, above both God of Wars. Everything about it stunned me, and having grown up with Dynasty Warriors, repetitive combat does absolutely no harm to a game for me.

10/10
It was the first game I'd ever Platinumed and I was disappointed that there wasn't more to do when I was done.
I got the game when it came out and I was locked down and laid off from COVID. It was the first game in a long time I played start to finish without bouncing around to other games
I totally agree with you. I changed my style of play depending on what was going on in the story, from just surviving, to trying to be honorable, to being a merciless ghost. Part of the difference between you/me  and OP is "buy-in." I felt like I was inhabiting the world and the character, and they didn't. For me, the repetitive enemies were fine: each slash of the blade and clang of swords felt real and interesting to me, because I was bought in to the world.
I spoiled the game for myself doing this.  

I was so completely enthralled with the beauty.  I'm a huge Akira Kurosowa fan, so it was perfect for me.  But after I cleared the first region I lost all steam.  

I really, really don't like the direction open world games have gone.  They're so repetitive.

        ...yeah that one's always weirded me out.  Nobody is holding a gun to your head forcing you to 100% a game.  Also like when people complain a game is "too easy."  Buddy, nobody is MAKING you use those unlimited continues or OP superweapon.  I got so good at Super C back in the day I started doing one life challenges and whatnot.

Why do people need their hands held 24/7?  Exercise some agency and play the way *you* want to.
        Yeah I love this sub, but sometimes reading about how people approach video games and how they play them and what constitutes "not respecting your time" makes me want to scream internally. I have to prevent myself from commenting to not seem like a party pooper. But at some point I think a lot of these people are deliberately choosing to play in ways that make you hate video games and all I can do is shrug and say it's your life.
        Because it's all new and interesting in the first area. You're discovering new things, helping everyone, upgrading and cleariv things out, meeting characters, etc. But then the next regions is all the same stuff. Which, until you advance into it, you don't really know is going to happen
            How do you not think the next area will be more of the same? Basically every game builds on this repetition... I can't think of a single game where this doesn't happen...
                They do a pretty good job of hiding how much is yet to be revealed.  You reveal a ton in the first region, and if you're leisurely playing through, that first region can rack up 30 hours.  I had no idea it was barely a third of the game.
        Yeah, I never understood this either. Devs are even starting to make fun of players, like BOTW having a literal poop be you reward for finding all korok seeds.

&#x200B;

You're not really expected to do all the content. It's spread around so no matter where you go, you can find content and gain resources, but this idea that you have to 100% an open world game is insanity. No wonder people hate these games.
        Totally agree with this! I LOVED GoT and got close to 100%. I genuinely could not get enough of every aspect, Even when it was boring I loved it. The extra bloat content was made for me!! Lol. I am so glad it's there. I ignore it for other games.
        People were bitching about all the stuff to do in Hogwarts Legacy and I mentioned the same thing. Just because there is stuff to do, doesn't mean you have to do it all.
        When you start a lot of open world games, you aren't yet aware that the small and semi interesting task you just did is going to need to be done umpteen more times again in every new area or region. So, in your first main area, you do the fetch quests, the mini game or two, the catch this task, follow that task, talk to these folks task, etc. Starter main areas also tend to be the most polished aspect of the game; it's the area or region that most developers spent the largest amount of time refining. It's the area that devs are using to 'show off' the game at expos and in demos.

So, while no one is 'forcing anyone', many players think that the next area or region or whatnot is going to be equally as fun and full of new tasks to do, and therein is the problem with most open world games, because the next area is going to be a slightly visually different but copy pasted version of that first area, and the next as well, and so on and so forth. The fetch this thing or follow that quest might be enjoyable once or twice because they are new, but not fifteen or twenty times. Too many open world games fill their world with these pretty mediocre bite sized tasks that just aren't that much fun to do more than once even.

You don't really know ahead of time what is going to be repetitive to you, until you've already repeated it enough that you've lost interest in doing it again. That can have a negative impact on how you then view the remainder of the game as well. Now you're staring at some marked up map full of things to do that you've little interest in doing. That is the definition of just straight up poor design, but devs are not going to stop chunking in that kind of content because it is relatively easy and cheap to do. Poor design is when you turn your players off from actively playing large segments of the content.

Of course, some are not going to mind the repetition, but that is less for the sake of the content and more for the completion of the content. Those players would play through to completion regardless, not simply because they enjoy the repetition.
    I mean. They've not really changed. Most seem to have cookie-cutter content all over the place. It's rare to find games that have interesting optional content with good stories.
> The combat was also basically rock paper scissors and button mashing.

and dark souls is just roll roll attack. Not sure why people think simplifying games down to their core is some kind of 'own' lol. Mario is just pressing the A button, Doom is just clicking on enemy sprites, etc.
I did the same thing and was burnt out on the second region. After a quest made me chase This smoke for about 10 minutes I finally decided to quit
    Wow I'm glad I'm not the only one, I really thought this was gonna be a game I could happily 100% but damn if I wasn't burnt out and underwhelmed by the repetitiveness and the protagonists personality/story.
That is exactly what I did, going a little too hard on all the side content. I enjoyed the game, but after a certain point, a quick break with another game turned into a permanent break
Thank god I’ve found my people. I was so sick of the discourse around this game when it came out- people pumped this game way way way too high up as a reaction to the divisive TLOU reactions when this game was beautiful but so, so mid.
    Were did all those people who cried about killing dogs in TLOU go? You have to kill so many dogs in GoT
        Oh I can field that one!

You don't have to listen to people cry snivel and wail like it's the end of the world about their guard dog every time you kill one in Ghost.  Guard dogs aren't housepets.  They're tools.  A dead guard dog doesn't mean you have an emotional breakdown, it means you sound the alarm.  TloU 2 tried to go so heavy on the pathos I first got bored with it and then I was seeing it as a comedy by the end.

Ellie (storyline wise, it really was not just game mechanics separation) murdering her way through dozens of unsuspecting people then deciding not to kill Abby had me rolling on the floor.  Bitch, why do you suddenly give a fuck about killing helpless people?
            [deleted]
                I mean seriously, Ellie is willing to wholesale slaughter people for nothing more than trying to keep raiders (you know, like Ellie is) out of their land.  Sneaking up and quietly slitting the throats of people who would probably do no more than jail her or run her out of town is morally pure and just.  When it came to killing someone that actually wronged her?  Oh no that's a bridge too far!  Only a monster would do THAT and Ellie doesn't wanna become a MONSTER.

I wonder how many other people Ellie killed under the cover of night on her way back home afterwards?
                Hey at least with Dollar General Indiana Jones his personality is consistent.  We know he's a selfish egotistical twat, and his games aren't trying to be THOUGHT PROVOKING REVOLUTIONARY WORKS OF ART!

I can buy Nathan's motivations even if I personally find the character repugnant.
                    [deleted]
                        Hence "Dollar General Indiana Jones."  He is not bright.
            You seem to really enjoy shitting on people with more emotional depth than you.
    Yup, if this was an Assassin's Creed game, people would have shat on it immediately. It plays almost exactly like one, super repetitive. But it was beautiful. The atmosphere and music was awesome.
This is exactly what happened to me and I didn’t even realize it
Exactly what happened to me, only I also fully cleared the second region. I stopped doing almost all the side stuff from then on. Loved the combat though….there was a fort in the middle of I think the second region that was I guess a story fort. You werent supposed to go there yet, so the alarms pop off and they send endless guys, and it was so fun just fighting them all. Eventually they sent magic death arrows to kill me but just taking on a giant mass of enemies was so satisfying
This happened to me with Witcher 3.
This is me with any open world game.

I've come to realise I much prefer more scripted linear games than open world games.
    You can just play the main quest line and ignore the side stuff. This is what I've done with Assassin's Creed games, Horizon, etc. and it keeps me from burning out. Most side content is repetitive anyway.
Same here. I went hard with the side quests in the first region and found myself getting bored but decided to push on, thinking I must be approaching the end game. Then the map opens up and basically doubles in size, which caused me to nope out and never come back. It’s a good example how having too much ‘content’ for the sake of content can drag down the overall experience. Some games can get away with it, but GoT just didn’t have enough gameplay variety to sustain it.
Did you play on hard mode? It really does make a big difference in combat.
    yea I was on hard
        You must be really good at games.
            i’m.. well, i’m kind of a pro gaymer myself, I’ll have you know 😏😏
                Pro gaymer moves
                you're a trackmaniac so you really are a pro gamer !! <3
    Once you upgrade in hard mode you can easily massacre any battle. The only way to play with the concept of dying for yourself is the realism one hit death mode as long as you don’t go stealthy. You are a one man arsenal in this game.
    This was huge for me- I never ever change difficulties in games but GOT really required me going to the highest level and that made it way better
You're allowed to take breaks and come back. That's what i did with this and got the enjoyment of the full game twice by clearing everything on both major halfs of the island.

Disagree about the combat. Weird take.
So your rec is just to focus on the main quests? My copy is in cellophane and I’ll probably crack it open next weekend.
    Do the main quest, take in the beauty, do stuff you organically come across. Chase some foxes to pet them.
        Good to know... i hadn't realized there were multiple islands yet lol.
    The Sidestory quests for each secondary character are really good too.

I even enjoyed the random people's quest but I also tried to focus more on the story they told and it made me feel like I was playing some kind of Kurosawa-like, wandering samurai serial.

However, if you only play games for the fighting mechanics and don't care too much about story then you'll probably want to go do the main story and the secondary characters.
Late to the post but I agree completely. I wish I’d find more story as to progression overall at first.
I agree. There’s enough here that I think a sequel could be really good. Flesh out the characters, make the quests and fighting more varied, and make the open world fun to interact with
Think you’ve hit the nail on the head there. The duels were my absolute favourite, so incredibly cinematic. Was a thrill every time. All the other stuff I generally skipped unless it gave me some cool cosmetics.
Funny - I get what you're saying but I'll add that my favorite part about the game was that it cut out so much of the standard AAA open world fat in the first place - I loved the wind guide, I loved that "crafting" and upgrading was about as minimal as it get, etc. 

It wasn't exactly anything earth shattering per se, but if you're going to do that formula I'm so so glad that they cut down on a ton of that stuff.
This, I absolutely second that take!
This game is so overrated. They focused on combat and still it's crappy. You're supposed to be using all these kinds of arrows and stuff, but will quickly discover that there are ways that work on everything. Freeze it, shoot it with three arrows from the big bow,  it takes a minute to drop anything. Also there are flying enemies, but you can't aim straight up, so when they're above you, you can't do shit 😄 Also the story was supposed to be mind blowing. It isn't.
    I mean... Sure, you can drop lots of enemies with that combo, but you have to know what to shoot, your gear has to be good enough to freeze your enemy quickly and you have to not miss. And you get resource-starved pretty quick if you use the freeze slingshot on everything.

And the combo won't necessarily work on the toughest enemies. Thunderjaws need a couple ropes and some armor blasting to make that work. The burrowing enemies are harder to catch. And hitting the combo is hella harder to do when you're under attack by 3 hyper-aggressive ravagers
        It just works. Maybe I really good I the game, but I reaaaaallyyu doubt it 😄 Never ran out of ammo either. It's annoying to try and hit them in the tiny weak spots since I discovered how effective this was. Dropped the legendary boss thunderjaw easily. Was disappointed how easy it was. Also I swear, they know when you're going to release the arrow and then move. Test it. Just hold the bow drawn, aim, wait... you can keep your reticle on target easily. As soon as you release the arrow they suddenly twitch and get out of the way. I'm convinced the game cheats that way. Made me stop trying, since freeze + blast them with highest damage arrows while they're frozen method drops anything. And when this ruined the combat for me... there's nothing else to this game. My GF liked it though, but she doesn't play a llt of games, so does not have anything to compare it to. It's a taboo topic now, I can't play it in her presence, cause she gets pissed when I criticize it 😆
            Hmmm... I've never encountered any input reading issues in that game. You were playing on max difficulty, right?

Edit: but yeah, at one point, even thunderjaws can be killed in a couple arrows. But that's normal, you get stronger and stronger over the course of the game
                Yes. Also tried to make it more difficult for myself so no healing during combat.
                    Is it you, Napoleon?
Late to this but Spiderman suffers from the same dull experience. Once you get past the swinging through NY it's just the same over and over.
It could have easily cut the entire thing in half and it would have been better.  I dont feel like it took me much more than 35-40 hrs, but I only stuck with the main side quests and ignored every other filler MMO type quest
Patientgamers taught me that a great game is a 10 hour game finished in 10 hours. 

A subpar game is a 10 hour game finished in 20 hours.
Yikes so it suffers from the Ubisoft formula
    It does indeed, but it's significantly better than your standard Ubi-junk imo. 

It's not a masterpiece, and it's definitely one of Sony's weaker offerings of late (but up against the rest of Sony output most recent AAA games look weak imo). But it's a solid game, visually beautiful, the combat is really tuned and precise, and there are a lot of serene moments throughout the game that immerse you into feudal Japan. 

I think it pays homage to that era like no other game to date, and that's where it really shines. 

It's very comparable to Hogwarts Legacy.
        It reminded me of Horizon Zero Dawn if you are to compare it to Sony’s other titles.

Absolutely gorgeous graphically, and with some uniqueness/DS4 features in the setting of Japan and each different robot you can fight/control.

But I just found each world to not have that much there, which was a shame really given the reviews for each one.

At least with Horizon Aloy sounds like she’s got some life to her.  With the exception of one scene English Jin has just sounded quite dull/expressionless imo.
            Watching more samurai or wuxia films might help you acclimate more to a stoic Asian protagonist
                Oh they’re like that?

Fair enough then - I’ll put it down to Ghost being my introduction to the genre.

I mean part of me did think that but at the same time it just felt odd - like several scenes when the atmosphere is quite tense say Jin (English Jin anyway) just didn’t sound like he was that bothered.
                    Pretty much. The stock hero character is dignified, unflappable, genteel in the face of adversity. Maybe the voice acting performance + limitations of the video game medium didn't convey the tension well. These things are often conveyed with facial expressions or body language moreso than direct emotionality
    I've somehow stayed away from the Ubisoft formula during my entire childhood and teenage years and am now starting to play some games and see what it is with games like Horizon and some of the new Tomb Raider as well as trying out some AC games.

There is a whole "sweep the map" thing going on, and it feels very hard if not impossible to go off the path you think the developpers would have wanted to have you on. It really feels like you're being railroaded, and exploring is very unrewarding, which should never happen in an open world.

So I see why people complain about it and agree with the criticism but I wonder why some game don't suffer from the same pitfalls despite having many similarities (open world explorarion games.)

Like... Rockstar and Bethesda also do open world rpg/adventure/exploration type of games and they manage do not suffer from the same flaws (they have other flaws though, Bethesda for instance makes remarkably unpolished games, although I really like their formula.)

The one who makes me the most curious though is Zelda Breath of the Wild, Nintendo really made an odd beast with this one, I find that it rewards exploration in a way other games like it don't, and I'm not quite sure how it does that. It made me feel like I was doing things I wasn't supposed to, exploring places I wasn't supposed to be in (even though I'm sure this was all intended.)
Atleast they could've added more enemies and/or have more civilians walking around on roads and doing stuff like they do in their camps.
I agree. It would have been better if all stances could be used, but they had different pro’s and con’s. Instead of only dealing damage when choosing the right one
    Hey OP, if you haven’t already you should check out the Nioh games. They also employ a stance system in their combat but it’s waaay more complex than what Tsushima does. I won’t say it’s necessary to master stance switching to beat the games, but learning how to really opens them up and gives you access to tons of combos, almost like a fighting game in a way.
        I tried Nioh 1 lately but it felt really overbearing with so much loot dropping, and I felt miserably bad at it (even Dark Souls made me feel better after the learning curve)... I really liked the japanese mythology theme and wanted to like the game but I couldn't get it to click for me
I actually enjoyed the way it was structured and how it forced you to use the different stances but I'm not really into complex fighting games either.

Overall, I agree the game was repetitive but my goodness I loved every minute of it.
That's a good point.
If I’m honest I’m still not sure what each stance is for.  I’ve been in the same one for pretty much the whole game and any enemy that‘s proving to be more difficult I just cheese with either a kunai or arrow.
    The mnemonics are mostly based on the Playstation face buttons.

X: two crossed swords.  
O: circular shield.  
Triangle: spear head.  
Square: square shield/big square dude (tenuous)
        Never thought of it that way actually.
    They just map to the different enemies and makes it easier to deal with them. 4 enemy types - 4 stances (sword guys, shield guys, spear guys, beeeg guys).

My best guess is it only makes a difference on the higher difficulties when you really need to be intentional with how you deal damage or you get your ass handed to you.
I think it feels forced when the game doesn't like that you're using the "wrong" stance,then it kinda pauses automatically and says "use stone stance with shielded enemies". Like,nah,I could take them down with whatever I want! Why give me options if you can't use whatever whenever.
We all know many people like open world games. It's why we have 99 AssCreed titles. There is obviously an audience for this stuff.
I loved everything about GoT. First game I platinum naturally because I just wanted to do everything because I was having so much fun. The combat was especially awesome, my god. And those duels were just so cool.
That's how I enjoyed Mad Max. Play it for a few hours, come back a week or so later play more, take a month off and come back. No harm in that.
It's actually a term, called 'ludonarrative dissonance' (which you probably know but for the benefit of passers by) which a lot of games suffer from.

When there's dissonance between the gameplay narrative and the story narrative it's really jarring and it happens in a lot of games that haven't thought about giving the player the freedom they've given them.

It's like when you're murdering thousands of enemies in gameplay and then in a cutscene get all upset about killing one person, it's just fucking jarring.
    GTA San Andreas in a nutshell
        Or GTA 4.
    Though many games are guilty of this, one of the most jarring I've experienced was Uncharted 4.
I liked and disliked that the game didn’t react to your play style. At first I thought it was lame that there wasn’t a second ending for people who never assassinated anyone ever. But then I realized that it would be incredibly limiting to gameplay.
I think this game would have really benefited from a simple honor system like in RDR2, and have different endings depending on your choices. 

I stormed through the main gate every time, and never used poison darts. Yet the game kept telling me how dirty I fought
    >I think this game would have really benefited from a simple honor system like in RDR2, and have different endings depending on your choices.

I dunno, I kinda feel like that stuff is just a little overrated. If a game is really story driven and it's not some big Skyrim-type RPG, I kinda just want them to tell their story. Sure, maybe there's some 'ludo-narrative dissonance' but then if you do it a lot you go the other way and you get a game with a really watered down story.

Like, yeah, the ninja/stealth stuff clashing with the honor culture is part of the conflict in the game. I wasn't sneaking everywhere on my own time but the game forces you to sneak enough where it basically justifies it. Otherwise you get a playthrough where your uncle and everyone is just like "Hey man, great job storming that camp... anyway..."
Yeah they should’ve written in another ending & made one canon
They could've worked it in better by actually having an interesting and unique stealth system, rather than the exact same skeletal framework that every ubisoft style game uses but with even fewer features

It's all about becoming the Ghost out of necessity, but outside of specific story missions it's neither fun nor necessary, so feels very contrived when you're forced into it
Same!  I always fought everyone straight up on unless the game literally forced me to do otherwise.  Stealth is pretty boring to me too and at least at first the combat was pretty fun.  So combat was the way I went.  Got pretty annoying that everyone kept talking down to me when I'm the biggest badass to have ever badassed, can take on the mongols like 60 to one, and do it all while just walking slowly up to their camp and shouting out a challenge.

I wish they had made the combat *way* harder, like almost impossible to take on more than a couple mongols at a time.  Then it would've made me feel forced to use the stealth systems to whittle the enemies down until they were at a manageable number to fight.
That's probably how it would have been though for a Samurai back then.
I think only doing the content you enjoy will help you like these games more. I stopped doing the quests I didn’t enjoy early on, but the repetitiveness shines through even if you just do the main quests and companion quests
This was a fun read, and I really agree about your points. Everything about rescuing hostages is a nightmare. If it’s any consolation, it gets even worse in act 3. 

«There’s a guy sitting in the attic three houses down from where I am. You have to kill him before I go. Oh you killed him? Well you forgot about the one patrolling the pier all across the camp. I refuse to leave before he’s gone too»

And I agree about traversal being difficult. Is it realistic to only have one path up and down a cliff? Sure. Is it more fun and better gameplay when you can climb most things? Yes
    >Everything about rescuing hostages is a nightmare. If it’s any consolation, it gets even worse in act 3

Oh god......😒
I'm checking my notes and I have 'Act 1: 8/10, Act 2: 10/10, Act 3: 8/10'

I suspect I might have skipped some things in Act 2 but thats where I got the most enjoyment out of the game.
It’s another one of those games that made me increasingly more weary of believing the hype when the ‘press’ (in quotes because the dynamics of gaming press right now mean that most of them are effectively paid-for marketeers) and fellow gamers talk about must play games and system sellers etc. This was another open world game, once again excellent presentation, once again a dead world with lots of repetition and whose claim to fame, strictly from a gameplay standpoint, was the wind instead of quest marker. The concept is very stale at this point, far cry 2 came out 15 years ago and nobody’s found a way around a lot of the limits that the formula already had back then.
    I have absolutely no way to prove my not-very-fleshed-out theory, but I've always felt like the insane praise that GoT got is directly related to the backlash that TLOU2 received. They're very different games, but both sort of came out at the same time and dominated online game circles for a while. TLOU2 is objectively the better game -- both technically, story-wise and graphically -- with more fluid gameplay and superior acting performances. It might not be everyone's cup of tea and some people might personally prefer GoT, but I find it baffling how people can call GoT the superior game. 

The main critique I kept reading about TLOU2 were about the story and pacing, but I'll never understand how the shallow story and repetitive pacing of GoT could somehow be better? I understand that these things are subjective, but like, there's just no way. Some even called GoT the game of the year, which was especially mind-blowing considering Miles Morales, Half Life: Alyx and Hades also came out in 2020.

I liked GoT at first, but wasn't able to finish it. I couldn't get over how lifeless everything felt: from the wooden acting to the robotic facial animations to the barren open world. Using the wind as a compass was fun, but felt like railroading to me -- there was absolutely nothing to explore besides the few places the wind pushed you towards. I don't know, maybe it's me though. I never understood the online love that Days Gone got either.
        I'm 100% convinced of the same thing lol. For whatever reason, people choose GoT as their champion just because they were mad at tlou2. And my other theory related to that is that most people that were complaining about one and praising the other had actually played neither of them.
Maybe you should just accept you're in the minority of not liking it.
How does it differ from the single player?
    They're basically two totally separate games. where single player kept it pretty realistic overall, multiplayer goes all in on old Japanese horror feel. It's not scary to play, but more ghosts and mystical things, a lot more spooky with more fantastic environments. Multiplayer has 3 modes: tales, waves, and raids. 

Tales is a string of 2 player coop missions with lots of collectables and challenges, stuff like opening extra chests for loot, optional super tough fights, new enemies, needing to stay within a certain range of your coop buddy, etc. It's exceptionally well done. 

Waves is 4 player survival. You've got 3 points to defend against various waves of enemies with a boss wave every 3rd wave if I remember correctly. It could use a few more maps to play on, but there was enough variety in enemies, challenges, and upgrading loot and builds to make it last a long time. 

Raids is only for max level characters, and there are 3 of them. The first two are extremely challenging, and they will take a few hours to complete, and you can't save progress in the middle. These are exceptionally well done. I absolutely loved them and wish there was more. Stuff like two zones to defend, one person on each, while the other two have to go through a gauntlet fighting mostly invisible enemies to get a buff they have to drop off back in base. Very challenging, and some of them are really intricate and require solid teamwork. The last raid is one boss, but also very challenging. 

You may have noticed I mentioned loot and builds. There are 4 classes with some neat abilities, and each has unique weapons and tools. So I'll play one that throws a healing gourd, summons a spirit dog to help us fight, has a moon stance katana, and a poison blowgun while you might have one with an ultimate that does 5 enemy headshots and a bow and kunai that ignite enemies. 

GoT Legends, the multiplayer mode, is something I wish they'd turn into a full on live service game, and I hate live service games. But it's just so good. My group and I played the crap out of it for a while, and now I miss it. But at least I can encourage everyone else to get on it.
If you don’t mind waiting: When you beat the main story, the remaining camps will show up on your map
    Thanks! I found that out by searching about it right before I saw your post. But I also searched the remaining camps in the area and freed Izuhara today lol I'll see what I'll do about the rest of them though
Bamboo strikes are a fine mini game. But this is kind of my point. I won’t find  anything except for the same kind of activities that’s already laid out on the map. 

Maybe I’m just more into exploring the unknown, and that makes it an unfair criticism of the game.
I'm swapping between traveler's armor and the Clan Sakai armor, because the traveler's armor looks the best but the Clan Sakai armor has the perk of killing five dudes in a standoff (when combined with the skill), which is a big chunk of the enemies in camps and usually the entirety of the random patrols.
> Not to mention collecting crickets, Sashimono banners (I guess you get a cosmetic saddle?), and Mongol records - I didn't see the point.

There's not really any point, but is there a point to anything in video games? I personally love collecting, and so I really enjoyed hunting down all of those items. I think it's more about what itches your proverbial gamer brain tickle lol.
I think people who are new to open world games would enjoy it more than a normal gamer (who plays open world and other types of games regularly).
to add (lol) : they are called mythic tales!


i also forgot to say i liked the wind guiding you to quest markers, that was a very nice touch 


and the basically no loading time between fast travel and cut scene was dope! 


i feel like i dogged the game a bit in my review haha i really did love it tho!! 
just frustrated because i few tweaks could have made it really epic! but it’ll be up there for me <3
Except the witcher 3 has some of the best side quests in the business. Some of my absute favourite moments in the game came from side quests.
    Yes I agree, I mean that every game afterwards that tried to copy the winning formula has failed spectacularly in that regard, instead of well developed and thought out side quests (Witcher 3) you end up with fetch quests (AC for example).
        I agree. Everytime I want to try out the side quests in subsequent games. It's just some random ass fetch quests.

The Witcher 3 is honestly the ideal version of the ubisoft formula. At its core, it's nothing innovative in that regards, but gets carried by the strength of its absolute stellar writing. And despite its abundant criticisms, cyberpunk works for me just because of that. The atmosphere and the quality of writing made it into one of my favourite games. But there's nothing more in it beyond that.
Open world doesn't mean repetitive enemy camps, garbage sidequests and copy paste shrines to find. Some games do an open world incredibly well. 

RDR 2 has a unique feeling open world - you have dozens and dozens of unique sites to find and sketch down in your notebook. Crashed gliders, hobbit house, manbearpig cabin, native burial ground, tiny church in the swamp, etc. All of them fascinating to find. 

Aside from those there are the random events in each town or the outskirts. Like the peeping tom in strawberry who gets started when you approach and if you peek in the window after him a woman starts yelling at you, or the 'vampire' encounter in st denis, or the wolfman running with his pack up north. 

Sidequests are unique and memorable, all of them. 

It's not hard to do, it just needs effort and care instead of following a tired formula and relying on graphics and combat only.
    I think the sidequests in GoT were passable to good. The good ones leaned more on understated emotion than outward quirkiness, and you got back however much you invested in. Finding the murdered woman/child in the river, dealing with your old servant and her failing memory and implied romance, the entire arc with your old teacher and his new student, even the quick ones like investigating the haunted woods were nicely atmospheric if you let them be. The only ones I really didn't care for were in the monks arc.
        ToC?
            GoT, bad autocorrect
    Hold on while I ride my horse throuhg pretty but empty areas to draw a picture. Activity may be different but the concept is the same.
        Rdr2 is probably the most boring open world I've ever played tbh all people talk about is "but the detail, the DETAILS!!!!" but other than that its pretty weak game overall. Tacked on survival mechanics when resources aren't even scarce. Make you move at an almost glacial pace because the game probably couldn't handle moving quickly through it because of all the "detail". Main story is full of unnecessary missions so story also moves at a glacial pace. They put in all the detail and forgot to make it fun.
This has nothing to do with it being open world, but how the open world is made. You’ve already received good replies on that point
I’m happy you enjoyed the game as much as you did. I disagree about about gamers being spoiled. In fact I think AAA game devs are getting complacent. Some of the mechanics are really old and weren’t that great to begin with. Killing animals to increase ammo capacity, clearing enemy camps to unlock a new part of the map. A big empty world to take you from one question mark to the next. I want some innovation and risk taking. 

And when making these big open worlds, either focus on making exploration exciting (Elden Ring, BOTW) or give me a fleshed out world I can interact with (RDR2). Ghost does neither.
    I completely agree that AAA game devs are getting complacent. And I mean... makes sense. Gaming has become a massive, lucrative market, and that naturally discourages risk-taking. You become formulaic and play it safe to rake in the big bucks. Nobody wants to take a gamble on a multi-million dollar project. I don't like it, but I get it. 

I just don't think Ghost of Tsushima is an example of that. I'd argue exploration was exciting because of how beautiful the world was. Combat was smooth and felt impactful. Open world "collectibles" were implemented in a charming way and didn't feel excessive or repetitive. 

Sure, the game didn't introduce anything groundbreaking to the genre - by definition, very few titles can do that. But it was a very fresh, pleasant take on already existing elements IMO. Definitely wouldn't go so far as to call it dull.
        I agree with you. And I get it that these companies don’t want to take risks. And why should they when the formula was created 15 years ago, and people still love it. 

Were we disagree is about wether it’s worth it to explore the beautiful world or not. Personally I didn’t after a while, but I can easily understand why many did
            Yeah at some point, it's just a matter of taste. I enjoyed the hell out of it, but people like different things.
It's FOMO.

When someone plays a game that's critically acclaimed and it turns out it's not the right game for them or isn't exactly what they would have wanted they must write a whole essay letting out their frustrations to anyone who will listen.

Like, what's even the point? Why not just move on instead of trying to convince everyone this game is shit? It's not going to change yours or anyone else's opinion on the game. All it will lead to is a pointless argument or circlejerk.
So do you think the newer assassin's creeds are worthwhile? I've considered trying one out, but there are so many mixed opinions and people saying they're just bloated and not worth the investment that I'm hesitant to jump in.
    I've honestly not played them but watched friends play quite a bit on Discord, the consensus among them is that Origins is worth it and quite good but don't expect traditional AC, Odyssey is ok but the side content isn't good and essentially mandatory due to level locked main quests and Valhalla can be fun but is so insanely long it drags quite a lot, it also looked really glitchy when I watched them play. Based on what I've seen and what they all said I'd give Origins a go, you can pick it up for really cheap
It sells. If ghost was a linear main story campaign with 5 enemy types way less people would have bought it.
    Would they though? TLOU Part 2 won GOTY against GoT and it is a pretty linear game. It just focuses on the story and experience instead of wasting resources on a pretty but empty world.
        Its very rare for a linear game story to be as good as the last of us or god of war though and ghost of tushima definitely wasn't as good. THe island of tushima being fully explorable mkaes snese and having tons of samurai tales in it was to the games benefit since that is pretty unique in open world games.
[deleted]
    Yeah, it makes sense that with rising price tags that developers would try to bloat games' length, but I think there's other ways to do so. TLOU Part 2 campaign is just as long or even longer than GoT and it does so without a boring open world. Games like Devil May Cry have even shorter campaigns but they have a lot of replayability due to skillful gameplay. Hopefully after Elden Ring developers realize how open world games should be and stop trying to turn every game into one of them.
The charms system is a mess. I had several of the exact same ones. And what do they do exactly? Sometimes the information is oddly specific (7,5 % quicker arrow reload) and other times I’m just guessing. «Moderate amount of damage reduction» I wouldn’t mind either one, but combined it’s weird
The reviews are very good, but not over the moon. What really surprise me is how high the user scores are. I’m happy for them, but it’s very surprising to me
    Yeah I was definitely surprised by how positive user scores were given what I experienced. It was the user scores and reports that led to me wanting to play it in the first place. After finishing it I had to double back and check if I'd just missed something in their discussions that might have mentioned the problems I had with the game. And while there definitely were some posts like yours that highlighted the problems, the overwhelming majority were singing its praise and nothing else. So many people were even praising it for the exact things that I had a problem with. 

Combat in particular seemed to receive a weird amount of praise for a system that I felt was tediously boring towards the end. Although I might have myself to blame on that front as I played GoT immediately after completing Sekiro and I think I couldn't help but compare one sword based combat system to the other while playing.

But I wish I'd had the experience that many seem to have. Although I enjoyed it, the game was mostly forgettable for me.
There’s no slander. Just a civilized discussion about the game. 

How did I cause my own issues? And why do you assume I was rushing? I was not. 

If you enjoyed the 50 fox den’s, that’s good for you. I think you’re probably in the minority. 

I’m talking about exploring outside the icon’s on the map. I won’t find a cool armor set or a new weapon by exploring. Looking for gold to upgrade your katana? There is none outside enemy camps

I didn’t fight against anything. Just sharing my opinion
    Ok but you’re just straight up wrong about many of these things. That’s the slander. 

You get powerful upgraded charms from completing all fox dens. 

You get to see some of the neatest little things in the game if you look for the hidden things that aren’t on the maps icons, for instance, places where you can bow to nature spirits and see things like a swarm of hundreds of fish jumping out of the water. 

Finding crickets gives you access to new songs which allow you to CONTROL THE WEATHER. This is told to you outright by a tutorial and you still missed it. 

Many of these things are gently pointed out to you by lightening bugs. I doubt you followed any lightening bugs. 

And yes the world will seem pretty flat and dead if you don’t read any of the writing you find, where you will learn about people’s lives and trials and what they love and lost. 

You were rushing and choosing not to interact with the world you already decided was worthless, whether you want to believe it or not.
        Here is the thing, i platinumed the game. I read through all the scrolls and item descriptions. I interacted with crickets, foxes etc.

BUT ALL OF IT US JUST BORING, ITS ALL BORING BUSY WORK. I wouldn't have done any of it if i wasn't going for platinum.
        If all I get for completing all the fox den’s are powerful charms, then I’m really happy that I stopped. 

I didn’t miss the cricket stuff, but I never went to look for them. So you’re right in that regard. Saying I rushed the game is just flat out wrong tho. Not everyone are completionists and trophy hunters. I did most of the content the game had to offer
            I’m not a completionist lol. I just like petting the foxes and making frogs dance.
                I liked petting the foxes too, but I was good after about 20
And I didn’t. I tried everything (which I think you should do) and then stopped doing the things I enjoyed the least
Totally. It’s not bad, it just could have been a lot better imo
That’s true. There are also open world games that are a lot better and more fun than GoT
I tried playing on lethal. It was fine, but combat itself was never my issue
No. I had all the time in the world and really wanted to love it
    Alright it seems you really tried haha
It might be a story game, but a lot of us didn’t think the story or the characters were that great unfortunately. Side content and side quests shouldn’t shape your experience in a video game?
    I think you look at the characters too superficially unfortunately. You see jin as a guy with a stick up his ass but ignore the context of his upbringing literally forcing him to be that stoic person we see. Samurai are not charismatic boisterous people. That was considered low brow and dishonorable. 

I already said it once, but I really really love how the devs stuck to the vibe so well and created a story that is true to itself
        I’m not ignoring his upbringing, but I wished we would see more of his personality, and dialogue that explored other stuff. Jin should have more layers than the game is showing us
A lot of people love it. I’d say yes just because I’m in the minority when it comes to this game
This is just wrong. There are great open world games, and poor design choices shouldn’t be excused with «well it’s open world»

«All» AAA games are open world. But not all open world games are the same
    Can you name an open world game that has tons of unique content and doesn't rely on the standard formula?
        What do you mean by unique content and standard formula?
Horizon games are very similar, but I think both GOW and TLOU are very different and not comparable to this one
    The skill trees, the constant talking. Its the whole sony formula which i m just so tired. I completed GOW Ragnarok and found it very bloated and unfocused and i loved 2018.

I just think its the sony games as a whole which feel so by the numbers, like marvel movies. Playing some indies to have a bit of refresh.
        Yeah I’ll be very interested to see where they go next
I’m sorry I hurt your feelings, but it’s just an opinion about a video game. And this game seems to split opinions a lot

I agree that the combat is good, I just think it lacks enemy variety and the stance system isn’t the greatest 

I’m happy you loved the story and the tone of the game, it just didn’t click for me.
The haiku in particular was a perfect use of the controller speaker.

Never had it before when the best part of a game for me has been the collectibles.
    I also liked how the haiku made you sit and APPRECIATE the view. I tend to zone out when I play and miss the vistas and I liked those segments. I did find some of the syllable choices not very appropriate and the “same” meditation song every time did wear thin
The ending really is incredible. Why couldn't the rest of the game be that good???
I was completely enthralled by the game. Getting off work and wanting to get home and play. I just wish they had more of a stealth setting while doing things as a ninja. Hiding in tall grass is fine and yeah I guess the ninja'ing was kinda a sub gameplay setting compared to fighting and doing things as a samurai. Even though the stealth and doing things against samurai code was a part of the game, they could of had two distinct play styles during combat and gameplay. Maybe the second one will have more.
    This is where mission design comes into play. You could totally stealth every Mongol village or take it by brute force. It would be cool, for example, completing the mission by destroying the black powder cache only with stealth, or having the enemies play defensively around the Mongol warlords. Towards the end of the game when you are collecting the Mongol armor, you had to duel each leader - it needed more of that. Maybe the enemies were the same 5 types, but they could have varied the "boss" characters to add some character and depth.
Yea, it got old real fast after they stopped introducing new things

I still have the DLC to do and have very little desire to boot it up again
    The DLC has a dope story, and it really gets into the Sakai history, but in terms of game play it's the same ol shit
I still maintain two of Vice City taped together is the largest size any open world "needs" to be, and even then smaller experiences can be awesome.  Go walk around Kabukicho in the Yakuza series.  Frickin' sublime, even though you can run across the map in about 5 minutes.
    Yes I prefer a dense map to a big map. Too much traveling gets boring after a while.
[deleted]
    ...yeah that one's always weirded me out.  Nobody is holding a gun to your head forcing you to 100% a game.  Also like when people complain a game is "too easy."  Buddy, nobody is MAKING you use those unlimited continues or OP superweapon.  I got so good at Super C back in the day I started doing one life challenges and whatnot.

Why do people need their hands held 24/7?  Exercise some agency and play the way *you* want to.
    Yeah I love this sub, but sometimes reading about how people approach video games and how they play them and what constitutes "not respecting your time" makes me want to scream internally. I have to prevent myself from commenting to not seem like a party pooper. But at some point I think a lot of these people are deliberately choosing to play in ways that make you hate video games and all I can do is shrug and say it's your life.
    Because it's all new and interesting in the first area. You're discovering new things, helping everyone, upgrading and cleariv things out, meeting characters, etc. But then the next regions is all the same stuff. Which, until you advance into it, you don't really know is going to happen
        How do you not think the next area will be more of the same? Basically every game builds on this repetition... I can't think of a single game where this doesn't happen...
            They do a pretty good job of hiding how much is yet to be revealed.  You reveal a ton in the first region, and if you're leisurely playing through, that first region can rack up 30 hours.  I had no idea it was barely a third of the game.
    Yeah, I never understood this either. Devs are even starting to make fun of players, like BOTW having a literal poop be you reward for finding all korok seeds.

&#x200B;

You're not really expected to do all the content. It's spread around so no matter where you go, you can find content and gain resources, but this idea that you have to 100% an open world game is insanity. No wonder people hate these games.
    Totally agree with this! I LOVED GoT and got close to 100%. I genuinely could not get enough of every aspect, Even when it was boring I loved it. The extra bloat content was made for me!! Lol. I am so glad it's there. I ignore it for other games.
    People were bitching about all the stuff to do in Hogwarts Legacy and I mentioned the same thing. Just because there is stuff to do, doesn't mean you have to do it all.
    When you start a lot of open world games, you aren't yet aware that the small and semi interesting task you just did is going to need to be done umpteen more times again in every new area or region. So, in your first main area, you do the fetch quests, the mini game or two, the catch this task, follow that task, talk to these folks task, etc. Starter main areas also tend to be the most polished aspect of the game; it's the area or region that most developers spent the largest amount of time refining. It's the area that devs are using to 'show off' the game at expos and in demos.

So, while no one is 'forcing anyone', many players think that the next area or region or whatnot is going to be equally as fun and full of new tasks to do, and therein is the problem with most open world games, because the next area is going to be a slightly visually different but copy pasted version of that first area, and the next as well, and so on and so forth. The fetch this thing or follow that quest might be enjoyable once or twice because they are new, but not fifteen or twenty times. Too many open world games fill their world with these pretty mediocre bite sized tasks that just aren't that much fun to do more than once even.

You don't really know ahead of time what is going to be repetitive to you, until you've already repeated it enough that you've lost interest in doing it again. That can have a negative impact on how you then view the remainder of the game as well. Now you're staring at some marked up map full of things to do that you've little interest in doing. That is the definition of just straight up poor design, but devs are not going to stop chunking in that kind of content because it is relatively easy and cheap to do. Poor design is when you turn your players off from actively playing large segments of the content.

Of course, some are not going to mind the repetition, but that is less for the sake of the content and more for the completion of the content. Those players would play through to completion regardless, not simply because they enjoy the repetition.
I mean. They've not really changed. Most seem to have cookie-cutter content all over the place. It's rare to find games that have interesting optional content with good stories.
Wow I'm glad I'm not the only one, I really thought this was gonna be a game I could happily 100% but damn if I wasn't burnt out and underwhelmed by the repetitiveness and the protagonists personality/story.
Were did all those people who cried about killing dogs in TLOU go? You have to kill so many dogs in GoT
    Oh I can field that one!

You don't have to listen to people cry snivel and wail like it's the end of the world about their guard dog every time you kill one in Ghost.  Guard dogs aren't housepets.  They're tools.  A dead guard dog doesn't mean you have an emotional breakdown, it means you sound the alarm.  TloU 2 tried to go so heavy on the pathos I first got bored with it and then I was seeing it as a comedy by the end.

Ellie (storyline wise, it really was not just game mechanics separation) murdering her way through dozens of unsuspecting people then deciding not to kill Abby had me rolling on the floor.  Bitch, why do you suddenly give a fuck about killing helpless people?
        [deleted]
            I mean seriously, Ellie is willing to wholesale slaughter people for nothing more than trying to keep raiders (you know, like Ellie is) out of their land.  Sneaking up and quietly slitting the throats of people who would probably do no more than jail her or run her out of town is morally pure and just.  When it came to killing someone that actually wronged her?  Oh no that's a bridge too far!  Only a monster would do THAT and Ellie doesn't wanna become a MONSTER.

I wonder how many other people Ellie killed under the cover of night on her way back home afterwards?
            Hey at least with Dollar General Indiana Jones his personality is consistent.  We know he's a selfish egotistical twat, and his games aren't trying to be THOUGHT PROVOKING REVOLUTIONARY WORKS OF ART!

I can buy Nathan's motivations even if I personally find the character repugnant.
                [deleted]
                    Hence "Dollar General Indiana Jones."  He is not bright.
        You seem to really enjoy shitting on people with more emotional depth than you.
Yup, if this was an Assassin's Creed game, people would have shat on it immediately. It plays almost exactly like one, super repetitive. But it was beautiful. The atmosphere and music was awesome.
You can just play the main quest line and ignore the side stuff. This is what I've done with Assassin's Creed games, Horizon, etc. and it keeps me from burning out. Most side content is repetitive anyway.
yea I was on hard
    You must be really good at games.
        i’m.. well, i’m kind of a pro gaymer myself, I’ll have you know 😏😏
            Pro gaymer moves
            you're a trackmaniac so you really are a pro gamer !! <3
Once you upgrade in hard mode you can easily massacre any battle. The only way to play with the concept of dying for yourself is the realism one hit death mode as long as you don’t go stealthy. You are a one man arsenal in this game.
This was huge for me- I never ever change difficulties in games but GOT really required me going to the highest level and that made it way better
Do the main quest, take in the beauty, do stuff you organically come across. Chase some foxes to pet them.
    Good to know... i hadn't realized there were multiple islands yet lol.
The Sidestory quests for each secondary character are really good too.

I even enjoyed the random people's quest but I also tried to focus more on the story they told and it made me feel like I was playing some kind of Kurosawa-like, wandering samurai serial.

However, if you only play games for the fighting mechanics and don't care too much about story then you'll probably want to go do the main story and the secondary characters.
I mean... Sure, you can drop lots of enemies with that combo, but you have to know what to shoot, your gear has to be good enough to freeze your enemy quickly and you have to not miss. And you get resource-starved pretty quick if you use the freeze slingshot on everything.

And the combo won't necessarily work on the toughest enemies. Thunderjaws need a couple ropes and some armor blasting to make that work. The burrowing enemies are harder to catch. And hitting the combo is hella harder to do when you're under attack by 3 hyper-aggressive ravagers
    It just works. Maybe I really good I the game, but I reaaaaallyyu doubt it 😄 Never ran out of ammo either. It's annoying to try and hit them in the tiny weak spots since I discovered how effective this was. Dropped the legendary boss thunderjaw easily. Was disappointed how easy it was. Also I swear, they know when you're going to release the arrow and then move. Test it. Just hold the bow drawn, aim, wait... you can keep your reticle on target easily. As soon as you release the arrow they suddenly twitch and get out of the way. I'm convinced the game cheats that way. Made me stop trying, since freeze + blast them with highest damage arrows while they're frozen method drops anything. And when this ruined the combat for me... there's nothing else to this game. My GF liked it though, but she doesn't play a llt of games, so does not have anything to compare it to. It's a taboo topic now, I can't play it in her presence, cause she gets pissed when I criticize it 😆
        Hmmm... I've never encountered any input reading issues in that game. You were playing on max difficulty, right?

Edit: but yeah, at one point, even thunderjaws can be killed in a couple arrows. But that's normal, you get stronger and stronger over the course of the game
            Yes. Also tried to make it more difficult for myself so no healing during combat.
                Is it you, Napoleon?
It does indeed, but it's significantly better than your standard Ubi-junk imo. 

It's not a masterpiece, and it's definitely one of Sony's weaker offerings of late (but up against the rest of Sony output most recent AAA games look weak imo). But it's a solid game, visually beautiful, the combat is really tuned and precise, and there are a lot of serene moments throughout the game that immerse you into feudal Japan. 

I think it pays homage to that era like no other game to date, and that's where it really shines. 

It's very comparable to Hogwarts Legacy.
    It reminded me of Horizon Zero Dawn if you are to compare it to Sony’s other titles.

Absolutely gorgeous graphically, and with some uniqueness/DS4 features in the setting of Japan and each different robot you can fight/control.

But I just found each world to not have that much there, which was a shame really given the reviews for each one.

At least with Horizon Aloy sounds like she’s got some life to her.  With the exception of one scene English Jin has just sounded quite dull/expressionless imo.
        Watching more samurai or wuxia films might help you acclimate more to a stoic Asian protagonist
            Oh they’re like that?

Fair enough then - I’ll put it down to Ghost being my introduction to the genre.

I mean part of me did think that but at the same time it just felt odd - like several scenes when the atmosphere is quite tense say Jin (English Jin anyway) just didn’t sound like he was that bothered.
                Pretty much. The stock hero character is dignified, unflappable, genteel in the face of adversity. Maybe the voice acting performance + limitations of the video game medium didn't convey the tension well. These things are often conveyed with facial expressions or body language moreso than direct emotionality
I've somehow stayed away from the Ubisoft formula during my entire childhood and teenage years and am now starting to play some games and see what it is with games like Horizon and some of the new Tomb Raider as well as trying out some AC games.

There is a whole "sweep the map" thing going on, and it feels very hard if not impossible to go off the path you think the developpers would have wanted to have you on. It really feels like you're being railroaded, and exploring is very unrewarding, which should never happen in an open world.

So I see why people complain about it and agree with the criticism but I wonder why some game don't suffer from the same pitfalls despite having many similarities (open world explorarion games.)

Like... Rockstar and Bethesda also do open world rpg/adventure/exploration type of games and they manage do not suffer from the same flaws (they have other flaws though, Bethesda for instance makes remarkably unpolished games, although I really like their formula.)

The one who makes me the most curious though is Zelda Breath of the Wild, Nintendo really made an odd beast with this one, I find that it rewards exploration in a way other games like it don't, and I'm not quite sure how it does that. It made me feel like I was doing things I wasn't supposed to, exploring places I wasn't supposed to be in (even though I'm sure this was all intended.)
Hey OP, if you haven’t already you should check out the Nioh games. They also employ a stance system in their combat but it’s waaay more complex than what Tsushima does. I won’t say it’s necessary to master stance switching to beat the games, but learning how to really opens them up and gives you access to tons of combos, almost like a fighting game in a way.
    I tried Nioh 1 lately but it felt really overbearing with so much loot dropping, and I felt miserably bad at it (even Dark Souls made me feel better after the learning curve)... I really liked the japanese mythology theme and wanted to like the game but I couldn't get it to click for me
The mnemonics are mostly based on the Playstation face buttons.

O: circular shield.  
Triangle: spear head.  
Square: square shield/big square dude (tenuous)
    Never thought of it that way actually.
They just map to the different enemies and makes it easier to deal with them. 4 enemy types - 4 stances (sword guys, shield guys, spear guys, beeeg guys).

My best guess is it only makes a difference on the higher difficulties when you really need to be intentional with how you deal damage or you get your ass handed to you.
GTA San Andreas in a nutshell
    Or GTA 4.
Though many games are guilty of this, one of the most jarring I've experienced was Uncharted 4.
>I think this game would have really benefited from a simple honor system like in RDR2, and have different endings depending on your choices.

I dunno, I kinda feel like that stuff is just a little overrated. If a game is really story driven and it's not some big Skyrim-type RPG, I kinda just want them to tell their story. Sure, maybe there's some 'ludo-narrative dissonance' but then if you do it a lot you go the other way and you get a game with a really watered down story.

Like, yeah, the ninja/stealth stuff clashing with the honor culture is part of the conflict in the game. I wasn't sneaking everywhere on my own time but the game forces you to sneak enough where it basically justifies it. Otherwise you get a playthrough where your uncle and everyone is just like "Hey man, great job storming that camp... anyway..."
>Everything about rescuing hostages is a nightmare. If it’s any consolation, it gets even worse in act 3

Oh god......😒
I have absolutely no way to prove my not-very-fleshed-out theory, but I've always felt like the insane praise that GoT got is directly related to the backlash that TLOU2 received. They're very different games, but both sort of came out at the same time and dominated online game circles for a while. TLOU2 is objectively the better game -- both technically, story-wise and graphically -- with more fluid gameplay and superior acting performances. It might not be everyone's cup of tea and some people might personally prefer GoT, but I find it baffling how people can call GoT the superior game. 

The main critique I kept reading about TLOU2 were about the story and pacing, but I'll never understand how the shallow story and repetitive pacing of GoT could somehow be better? I understand that these things are subjective, but like, there's just no way. Some even called GoT the game of the year, which was especially mind-blowing considering Miles Morales, Half Life: Alyx and Hades also came out in 2020.

I liked GoT at first, but wasn't able to finish it. I couldn't get over how lifeless everything felt: from the wooden acting to the robotic facial animations to the barren open world. Using the wind as a compass was fun, but felt like railroading to me -- there was absolutely nothing to explore besides the few places the wind pushed you towards. I don't know, maybe it's me though. I never understood the online love that Days Gone got either.
    I'm 100% convinced of the same thing lol. For whatever reason, people choose GoT as their champion just because they were mad at tlou2. And my other theory related to that is that most people that were complaining about one and praising the other had actually played neither of them.
They're basically two totally separate games. where single player kept it pretty realistic overall, multiplayer goes all in on old Japanese horror feel. It's not scary to play, but more ghosts and mystical things, a lot more spooky with more fantastic environments. Multiplayer has 3 modes: tales, waves, and raids. 

Tales is a string of 2 player coop missions with lots of collectables and challenges, stuff like opening extra chests for loot, optional super tough fights, new enemies, needing to stay within a certain range of your coop buddy, etc. It's exceptionally well done. 

Waves is 4 player survival. You've got 3 points to defend against various waves of enemies with a boss wave every 3rd wave if I remember correctly. It could use a few more maps to play on, but there was enough variety in enemies, challenges, and upgrading loot and builds to make it last a long time. 

Raids is only for max level characters, and there are 3 of them. The first two are extremely challenging, and they will take a few hours to complete, and you can't save progress in the middle. These are exceptionally well done. I absolutely loved them and wish there was more. Stuff like two zones to defend, one person on each, while the other two have to go through a gauntlet fighting mostly invisible enemies to get a buff they have to drop off back in base. Very challenging, and some of them are really intricate and require solid teamwork. The last raid is one boss, but also very challenging. 

You may have noticed I mentioned loot and builds. There are 4 classes with some neat abilities, and each has unique weapons and tools. So I'll play one that throws a healing gourd, summons a spirit dog to help us fight, has a moon stance katana, and a poison blowgun while you might have one with an ultimate that does 5 enemy headshots and a bow and kunai that ignite enemies. 

GoT Legends, the multiplayer mode, is something I wish they'd turn into a full on live service game, and I hate live service games. But it's just so good. My group and I played the crap out of it for a while, and now I miss it. But at least I can encourage everyone else to get on it.
Thanks! I found that out by searching about it right before I saw your post. But I also searched the remaining camps in the area and freed Izuhara today lol I'll see what I'll do about the rest of them though
Yes I agree, I mean that every game afterwards that tried to copy the winning formula has failed spectacularly in that regard, instead of well developed and thought out side quests (Witcher 3) you end up with fetch quests (AC for example).
    I agree. Everytime I want to try out the side quests in subsequent games. It's just some random ass fetch quests.

The Witcher 3 is honestly the ideal version of the ubisoft formula. At its core, it's nothing innovative in that regards, but gets carried by the strength of its absolute stellar writing. And despite its abundant criticisms, cyberpunk works for me just because of that. The atmosphere and the quality of writing made it into one of my favourite games. But there's nothing more in it beyond that.
I think the sidequests in GoT were passable to good. The good ones leaned more on understated emotion than outward quirkiness, and you got back however much you invested in. Finding the murdered woman/child in the river, dealing with your old servant and her failing memory and implied romance, the entire arc with your old teacher and his new student, even the quick ones like investigating the haunted woods were nicely atmospheric if you let them be. The only ones I really didn't care for were in the monks arc.
    ToC?
        GoT, bad autocorrect
Hold on while I ride my horse throuhg pretty but empty areas to draw a picture. Activity may be different but the concept is the same.
    Rdr2 is probably the most boring open world I've ever played tbh all people talk about is "but the detail, the DETAILS!!!!" but other than that its pretty weak game overall. Tacked on survival mechanics when resources aren't even scarce. Make you move at an almost glacial pace because the game probably couldn't handle moving quickly through it because of all the "detail". Main story is full of unnecessary missions so story also moves at a glacial pace. They put in all the detail and forgot to make it fun.
I completely agree that AAA game devs are getting complacent. And I mean... makes sense. Gaming has become a massive, lucrative market, and that naturally discourages risk-taking. You become formulaic and play it safe to rake in the big bucks. Nobody wants to take a gamble on a multi-million dollar project. I don't like it, but I get it. 

I just don't think Ghost of Tsushima is an example of that. I'd argue exploration was exciting because of how beautiful the world was. Combat was smooth and felt impactful. Open world "collectibles" were implemented in a charming way and didn't feel excessive or repetitive. 

Sure, the game didn't introduce anything groundbreaking to the genre - by definition, very few titles can do that. But it was a very fresh, pleasant take on already existing elements IMO. Definitely wouldn't go so far as to call it dull.
    I agree with you. And I get it that these companies don’t want to take risks. And why should they when the formula was created 15 years ago, and people still love it. 

Were we disagree is about wether it’s worth it to explore the beautiful world or not. Personally I didn’t after a while, but I can easily understand why many did
        Yeah at some point, it's just a matter of taste. I enjoyed the hell out of it, but people like different things.
I've honestly not played them but watched friends play quite a bit on Discord, the consensus among them is that Origins is worth it and quite good but don't expect traditional AC, Odyssey is ok but the side content isn't good and essentially mandatory due to level locked main quests and Valhalla can be fun but is so insanely long it drags quite a lot, it also looked really glitchy when I watched them play. Based on what I've seen and what they all said I'd give Origins a go, you can pick it up for really cheap
Would they though? TLOU Part 2 won GOTY against GoT and it is a pretty linear game. It just focuses on the story and experience instead of wasting resources on a pretty but empty world.
    Its very rare for a linear game story to be as good as the last of us or god of war though and ghost of tushima definitely wasn't as good. THe island of tushima being fully explorable mkaes snese and having tons of samurai tales in it was to the games benefit since that is pretty unique in open world games.
Yeah, it makes sense that with rising price tags that developers would try to bloat games' length, but I think there's other ways to do so. TLOU Part 2 campaign is just as long or even longer than GoT and it does so without a boring open world. Games like Devil May Cry have even shorter campaigns but they have a lot of replayability due to skillful gameplay. Hopefully after Elden Ring developers realize how open world games should be and stop trying to turn every game into one of them.
Yeah I was definitely surprised by how positive user scores were given what I experienced. It was the user scores and reports that led to me wanting to play it in the first place. After finishing it I had to double back and check if I'd just missed something in their discussions that might have mentioned the problems I had with the game. And while there definitely were some posts like yours that highlighted the problems, the overwhelming majority were singing its praise and nothing else. So many people were even praising it for the exact things that I had a problem with. 

Combat in particular seemed to receive a weird amount of praise for a system that I felt was tediously boring towards the end. Although I might have myself to blame on that front as I played GoT immediately after completing Sekiro and I think I couldn't help but compare one sword based combat system to the other while playing.

But I wish I'd had the experience that many seem to have. Although I enjoyed it, the game was mostly forgettable for me.
Ok but you’re just straight up wrong about many of these things. That’s the slander. 

You get powerful upgraded charms from completing all fox dens. 

You get to see some of the neatest little things in the game if you look for the hidden things that aren’t on the maps icons, for instance, places where you can bow to nature spirits and see things like a swarm of hundreds of fish jumping out of the water. 

Finding crickets gives you access to new songs which allow you to CONTROL THE WEATHER. This is told to you outright by a tutorial and you still missed it. 

Many of these things are gently pointed out to you by lightening bugs. I doubt you followed any lightening bugs. 

And yes the world will seem pretty flat and dead if you don’t read any of the writing you find, where you will learn about people’s lives and trials and what they love and lost. 

You were rushing and choosing not to interact with the world you already decided was worthless, whether you want to believe it or not.
    Here is the thing, i platinumed the game. I read through all the scrolls and item descriptions. I interacted with crickets, foxes etc.

BUT ALL OF IT US JUST BORING, ITS ALL BORING BUSY WORK. I wouldn't have done any of it if i wasn't going for platinum.
    If all I get for completing all the fox den’s are powerful charms, then I’m really happy that I stopped. 

I didn’t miss the cricket stuff, but I never went to look for them. So you’re right in that regard. Saying I rushed the game is just flat out wrong tho. Not everyone are completionists and trophy hunters. I did most of the content the game had to offer
        I’m not a completionist lol. I just like petting the foxes and making frogs dance.
            I liked petting the foxes too, but I was good after about 20
Alright it seems you really tried haha
I think you look at the characters too superficially unfortunately. You see jin as a guy with a stick up his ass but ignore the context of his upbringing literally forcing him to be that stoic person we see. Samurai are not charismatic boisterous people. That was considered low brow and dishonorable. 

I already said it once, but I really really love how the devs stuck to the vibe so well and created a story that is true to itself
    I’m not ignoring his upbringing, but I wished we would see more of his personality, and dialogue that explored other stuff. Jin should have more layers than the game is showing us
Can you name an open world game that has tons of unique content and doesn't rely on the standard formula?
    What do you mean by unique content and standard formula?
The skill trees, the constant talking. Its the whole sony formula which i m just so tired. I completed GOW Ragnarok and found it very bloated and unfocused and i loved 2018.

I just think its the sony games as a whole which feel so by the numbers, like marvel movies. Playing some indies to have a bit of refresh.
    Yeah I’ll be very interested to see where they go next
I also liked how the haiku made you sit and APPRECIATE the view. I tend to zone out when I play and miss the vistas and I liked those segments. I did find some of the syllable choices not very appropriate and the “same” meditation song every time did wear thin
This is where mission design comes into play. You could totally stealth every Mongol village or take it by brute force. It would be cool, for example, completing the mission by destroying the black powder cache only with stealth, or having the enemies play defensively around the Mongol warlords. Towards the end of the game when you are collecting the Mongol armor, you had to duel each leader - it needed more of that. Maybe the enemies were the same 5 types, but they could have varied the "boss" characters to add some character and depth.
The DLC has a dope story, and it really gets into the Sakai history, but in terms of game play it's the same ol shit
Yes I prefer a dense map to a big map. Too much traveling gets boring after a while.
...yeah that one's always weirded me out.  Nobody is holding a gun to your head forcing you to 100% a game.  Also like when people complain a game is "too easy."  Buddy, nobody is MAKING you use those unlimited continues or OP superweapon.  I got so good at Super C back in the day I started doing one life challenges and whatnot.

Why do people need their hands held 24/7?  Exercise some agency and play the way *you* want to.
Yeah I love this sub, but sometimes reading about how people approach video games and how they play them and what constitutes "not respecting your time" makes me want to scream internally. I have to prevent myself from commenting to not seem like a party pooper. But at some point I think a lot of these people are deliberately choosing to play in ways that make you hate video games and all I can do is shrug and say it's your life.
Because it's all new and interesting in the first area. You're discovering new things, helping everyone, upgrading and cleariv things out, meeting characters, etc. But then the next regions is all the same stuff. Which, until you advance into it, you don't really know is going to happen
    How do you not think the next area will be more of the same? Basically every game builds on this repetition... I can't think of a single game where this doesn't happen...
        They do a pretty good job of hiding how much is yet to be revealed.  You reveal a ton in the first region, and if you're leisurely playing through, that first region can rack up 30 hours.  I had no idea it was barely a third of the game.
Yeah, I never understood this either. Devs are even starting to make fun of players, like BOTW having a literal poop be you reward for finding all korok seeds.

&#x200B;

You're not really expected to do all the content. It's spread around so no matter where you go, you can find content and gain resources, but this idea that you have to 100% an open world game is insanity. No wonder people hate these games.
Totally agree with this! I LOVED GoT and got close to 100%. I genuinely could not get enough of every aspect, Even when it was boring I loved it. The extra bloat content was made for me!! Lol. I am so glad it's there. I ignore it for other games.
People were bitching about all the stuff to do in Hogwarts Legacy and I mentioned the same thing. Just because there is stuff to do, doesn't mean you have to do it all.
When you start a lot of open world games, you aren't yet aware that the small and semi interesting task you just did is going to need to be done umpteen more times again in every new area or region. So, in your first main area, you do the fetch quests, the mini game or two, the catch this task, follow that task, talk to these folks task, etc. Starter main areas also tend to be the most polished aspect of the game; it's the area or region that most developers spent the largest amount of time refining. It's the area that devs are using to 'show off' the game at expos and in demos.

So, while no one is 'forcing anyone', many players think that the next area or region or whatnot is going to be equally as fun and full of new tasks to do, and therein is the problem with most open world games, because the next area is going to be a slightly visually different but copy pasted version of that first area, and the next as well, and so on and so forth. The fetch this thing or follow that quest might be enjoyable once or twice because they are new, but not fifteen or twenty times. Too many open world games fill their world with these pretty mediocre bite sized tasks that just aren't that much fun to do more than once even.

You don't really know ahead of time what is going to be repetitive to you, until you've already repeated it enough that you've lost interest in doing it again. That can have a negative impact on how you then view the remainder of the game as well. Now you're staring at some marked up map full of things to do that you've little interest in doing. That is the definition of just straight up poor design, but devs are not going to stop chunking in that kind of content because it is relatively easy and cheap to do. Poor design is when you turn your players off from actively playing large segments of the content.

Of course, some are not going to mind the repetition, but that is less for the sake of the content and more for the completion of the content. Those players would play through to completion regardless, not simply because they enjoy the repetition.
Oh I can field that one!

You don't have to listen to people cry snivel and wail like it's the end of the world about their guard dog every time you kill one in Ghost.  Guard dogs aren't housepets.  They're tools.  A dead guard dog doesn't mean you have an emotional breakdown, it means you sound the alarm.  TloU 2 tried to go so heavy on the pathos I first got bored with it and then I was seeing it as a comedy by the end.

Ellie (storyline wise, it really was not just game mechanics separation) murdering her way through dozens of unsuspecting people then deciding not to kill Abby had me rolling on the floor.  Bitch, why do you suddenly give a fuck about killing helpless people?
    [deleted]
        I mean seriously, Ellie is willing to wholesale slaughter people for nothing more than trying to keep raiders (you know, like Ellie is) out of their land.  Sneaking up and quietly slitting the throats of people who would probably do no more than jail her or run her out of town is morally pure and just.  When it came to killing someone that actually wronged her?  Oh no that's a bridge too far!  Only a monster would do THAT and Ellie doesn't wanna become a MONSTER.

I wonder how many other people Ellie killed under the cover of night on her way back home afterwards?
        Hey at least with Dollar General Indiana Jones his personality is consistent.  We know he's a selfish egotistical twat, and his games aren't trying to be THOUGHT PROVOKING REVOLUTIONARY WORKS OF ART!

I can buy Nathan's motivations even if I personally find the character repugnant.
            [deleted]
                Hence "Dollar General Indiana Jones."  He is not bright.
    You seem to really enjoy shitting on people with more emotional depth than you.
You must be really good at games.
    i’m.. well, i’m kind of a pro gaymer myself, I’ll have you know 😏😏
        Pro gaymer moves
        you're a trackmaniac so you really are a pro gamer !! <3
Good to know... i hadn't realized there were multiple islands yet lol.
It just works. Maybe I really good I the game, but I reaaaaallyyu doubt it 😄 Never ran out of ammo either. It's annoying to try and hit them in the tiny weak spots since I discovered how effective this was. Dropped the legendary boss thunderjaw easily. Was disappointed how easy it was. Also I swear, they know when you're going to release the arrow and then move. Test it. Just hold the bow drawn, aim, wait... you can keep your reticle on target easily. As soon as you release the arrow they suddenly twitch and get out of the way. I'm convinced the game cheats that way. Made me stop trying, since freeze + blast them with highest damage arrows while they're frozen method drops anything. And when this ruined the combat for me... there's nothing else to this game. My GF liked it though, but she doesn't play a llt of games, so does not have anything to compare it to. It's a taboo topic now, I can't play it in her presence, cause she gets pissed when I criticize it 😆
    Hmmm... I've never encountered any input reading issues in that game. You were playing on max difficulty, right?

Edit: but yeah, at one point, even thunderjaws can be killed in a couple arrows. But that's normal, you get stronger and stronger over the course of the game
        Yes. Also tried to make it more difficult for myself so no healing during combat.
            Is it you, Napoleon?
It reminded me of Horizon Zero Dawn if you are to compare it to Sony’s other titles.

Absolutely gorgeous graphically, and with some uniqueness/DS4 features in the setting of Japan and each different robot you can fight/control.

But I just found each world to not have that much there, which was a shame really given the reviews for each one.

At least with Horizon Aloy sounds like she’s got some life to her.  With the exception of one scene English Jin has just sounded quite dull/expressionless imo.
    Watching more samurai or wuxia films might help you acclimate more to a stoic Asian protagonist
        Oh they’re like that?

Fair enough then - I’ll put it down to Ghost being my introduction to the genre.

I mean part of me did think that but at the same time it just felt odd - like several scenes when the atmosphere is quite tense say Jin (English Jin anyway) just didn’t sound like he was that bothered.
            Pretty much. The stock hero character is dignified, unflappable, genteel in the face of adversity. Maybe the voice acting performance + limitations of the video game medium didn't convey the tension well. These things are often conveyed with facial expressions or body language moreso than direct emotionality
I tried Nioh 1 lately but it felt really overbearing with so much loot dropping, and I felt miserably bad at it (even Dark Souls made me feel better after the learning curve)... I really liked the japanese mythology theme and wanted to like the game but I couldn't get it to click for me
Never thought of it that way actually.
Or GTA 4.
