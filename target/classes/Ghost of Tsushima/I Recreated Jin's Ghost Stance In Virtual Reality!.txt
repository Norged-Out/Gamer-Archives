[[I Recreated Jin's Ghost Stance In Virtual Reality!]]





My favorite VR game. Well done.
    Thank you! :)
This would be cathartic after a long work week
    Agreed
WHAT GAME IS THIS ?
    Blade and Sorcery. The katana may be a mod, I don't recall ever seeing it.
        [removed]
            ?
                It's just a weird bot account.
                    I see...
                    Reminds me a bit of a number station, but using reddit and random names as a medium


https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbers_station
                        Huh, it does seem weirdly similar... also what kills me is that this bot has like 23k+ karma from just spewing nonsense. Also it has given awards?! Then again it might've been used as a regular account at some point.
    Yup it's called Blade & Sorcery. Probably one of the best VR games out right now.
        I haven't got VR yet because of the cost but cannot wait to play this and beat saber when I eventually get one
            If you‚Äôre planning to get into VR soon keep in mind oculus is pulling some bullshit and requiring a Facebook account in 2023. Im probably gonna end up selling my rift
                Yeah I have seen, not rushing into it yet, few more months/year, got to rebuilt PC soon and then will be a mid 2021 treat probably. How much VR games cost now ? They ever go on sale ?
                    Most VR games are pretty small you can expect to pay $30-40. I think half life alyx is $60. Honestly haven‚Äôt seen many sales but I‚Äôm not exactly looking
                Several camera in my room facing every angle, all owned by Facebook?*  No thank you, IR pls
                    Yea fuck that lol
                    Unplug/store when not in use. It‚Äôs proper care of the device anyway. You don‚Äôt want dust building up on the lenses.
                        Even when in use its a creepy thought.
                    I feel like people are forgetting the fact that spying and selling your info to third parties is completely illegal. If there was anything similar happening with facebook, it would be taken down.
                        Lol Naive much?
                            Very....
                HTC Vive for me!
                For real?!? I'm glad I didn't buy that bullshit!
                    Classic zuck move
                I‚Äôm not rooting for Facebook or anything but how hard is it to create a fake account just to play some VR? Like can‚Äôt you put fake info and pic of your dog?
                    You can but it usually gets deleted by Facebook. If you go further down this thread we explained it a bit better
                So wait, why do y'all have an issue with using a facebook account? I already linked mine and it doesn't change anything.
                    Because Facebook is absolute shit and I don‚Äôt have one. Definitely not gonna make one to play video games. If you think ol zuckerburg spying on you doesn‚Äôt change anything that‚Äôs on you
                        Just make a shell account with all false info, and never post anything.
                            Would if I could, those get banned pretty quick for ‚Äúfalse information‚Äù
                                No it doesn't.
                                    Yes it does. It has happened to me
                                    I just tried earlier this year with a fake name and it said "must use real name"

Finally boiled it down to near real name but never use it..deleted it again
            if u buy VR just because Beatsaber, then u are good to go, blade and sorcery is not for everyone, its very hard to do it just like in the video, its a sim remember that..

i tried myself its really fun at first, but its getting annoying because i cant hit ir slashing the enemy as easy as jin sakai.. maybe because im botbusing any mod idk.. the enemy is hard to kill... not like in this video
                also maybe because jin is a samurai and i doubt you are
                    lol.. in reality we all suck at this..
VR is like a simulation.. its not 100% pure fun game..

not easy as it looks, unless its shooting game. oh thats more easy and even can be better than FlatScreen gamers... same with racing
        Which katana mod do you use? Im looking for one myself :)

&#x200B;

You know what, fuck it, can you tell me the names of all the mods you're using?? I have a major problem with not being able to pierce enemy armour despite trying as hard as i can. 

&#x200B;

Thanks for the response :3
            I am using:

[Kikaku's Ninja Pack (Katana)](https://www.nexusmods.com/bladeandsorcery/mods/2492)

[Ragdoll Physics Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/bladeandsorcery/mods/1545)

And that's really all I use because my performance is terrible if I have too many activated at once lol
            And also I disabled armor in the book settings. That's how I was cutting them so easily
                Hell yeah, thanks :D

Also, I've tried the disable armor function except it never worked. My sword even slides off when trying to pierce bare skin on an enemy lying on the ground :(

Maybe it was one of the mods conflicting, will try without them

Thanks!
        Is it on psvr?
Lmao and you demolished them too with it
    Agreed lol!
Did you do that in slow motion or realtime?
This is so amazing and creative
    Thanks! I actually felt like Jin for a second lol
Yes
I want a VR literally JUST to play Blade and Sorcery
    Quest is pretty good. You can play PC VR if you get a link cable or virtual desktop and it‚Äôs one of the cheapest VR headsets
Unrealistic, Jin can only kill 3, enemies and you clearly killed more. It's inaccurate, 3/10.
    ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
    Five if you wear the right armour.
Edit. I realised this is about rage mode, not duels.

Pobody's nerfect...
        No problem.
    They're clearly wearing the fully upgraded Sakai Clan armor then activated the Ghost Stance. Get good.
        Uuuummm.

/S?

In case you're not sarcastic, the Sakai armour only affects the amount of standoffs kills you can perform, not the amount of ghost stance kills you can get, you can only get 3 no matter what.
Epic, because I just got this part today, die Temegue
Awesome ! And I just learned a game that i didn‚Äôt know existed.
Wow bro this is so fucking amazing, I‚Äôm sorry I can‚Äôt give you an award this is dope
    I can give you an award now! :D
        You‚Äôre too kind!
With yarikawa's theme, it would have been perfect.
So sick
Absolute Awesome sauce
Yo this is really good VR

Is this game on PlayStation VR
now show us the irl footage.
Dayum
WHERE IS THE SHEATHING OF THE SWORD?!
I still wish their bodies fell apart at the white slash line...
Fucking sick
CAN THIS PLEASE COME TO OCULUS QUEST
The little backhand at the beginning üòÇ
Used more than 3 kills in ghost stance 0/10
Showoff
The dodge-stab follow,up at the end was *chef's kiss*
I used to do standoffs in GORN. Shit was hella fun
Ngl Japanese dub is ruined for me by this voice actor I can only hear him as zoro.
Thank you! :)
Agreed

                    I just tried earlier this year with a fake name and it said "must use real name"

Finally boiled it down to near real name but never use it..deleted it again
also maybe because jin is a samurai and i doubt you are
    lol.. in reality we all suck at this..
VR is like a simulation.. its not 100% pure fun game..

not easy as it looks, unless its shooting game. oh thats more easy and even can be better than FlatScreen gamers... same with racing
Hell yeah, thanks :D

Also, I've tried the disable armor function except it never worked. My sword even slides off when trying to pierce bare skin on an enemy lying on the ground :(

Maybe it was one of the mods conflicting, will try without them

Thanks!
I see...
Reminds me a bit of a number station, but using reddit and random names as a medium

    Huh, it does seem weirdly similar... also what kills me is that this bot has like 23k+ karma from just spewing nonsense. Also it has given awards?! Then again it might've been used as a regular account at some point.
Most VR games are pretty small you can expect to pay $30-40. I think half life alyx is $60. Honestly haven‚Äôt seen many sales but I‚Äôm not exactly looking
Yea fuck that lol
Unplug/store when not in use. It‚Äôs proper care of the device anyway. You don‚Äôt want dust building up on the lenses.
    Even when in use its a creepy thought.
I feel like people are forgetting the fact that spying and selling your info to third parties is completely illegal. If there was anything similar happening with facebook, it would be taken down.
    Lol Naive much?
        Very....
Classic zuck move
You can but it usually gets deleted by Facebook. If you go further down this thread we explained it a bit better
Because Facebook is absolute shit and I don‚Äôt have one. Definitely not gonna make one to play video games. If you think ol zuckerburg spying on you doesn‚Äôt change anything that‚Äôs on you
    Just make a shell account with all false info, and never post anything.
        Would if I could, those get banned pretty quick for ‚Äúfalse information‚Äù
