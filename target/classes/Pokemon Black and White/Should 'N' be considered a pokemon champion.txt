[[Should 'N' be considered a pokemon champion]]


N defeated Alder and served as the boss of the E4 of BW main story (then secret bonus battle against cheating ghetsis), he is essentialy the Blue of Unova. But he is never counted as a champion in any media, official or fanbased, I feel like he should actually be considered the champion,

Thoughts?

&#x200B;

EDIT: some summary of the discussion. There's a lot of people stating that N couldn't be champion because he didn't do the gym challenge/beat the E4, but he actually did, though it's a bit downplayed. The key debate then seems to be about wether N wanted to be champion/would be allowed to be champion. Or if he had the time to be registered as a champion between beating Alder and meeting the player  
Being allowed to be champion raises questions which afaik ar not properly answered in game lore, like can a champion deny a challenger? What does it actually mean to be a champion legally? 


Yes and no. He defeated a champion, as far as we know completely fair and square, so he is technically a champion. However, he never had his party officially recognized in the Hall of Fame, so he also technically isn't.

I doubt he'd want to be known as a champion considering his thoughts on battling.
    Technically the player also did not enter the hall of fame the first time since the battle is interuppted by team plasma and is still considered champion (though the game still register the team but this should not be considered in game lore).

I would say N technically is one, but he reject the title or something.
        The player isn't considered a champion after the main story. Their party being registered is either purely for gameplay so the player can look back on their first team. Or after Ghetsis was arrested, the player was registered in the Hall of Fame as a reward for defeating Team Plasma, but wasn't outright deemed a champion since they technically didn't defeat one.
            Looking at the text dump, you are right. This must be the first game where you begin the post game as technically not a champion i guess.

            This is outrageous! It's unfair!
                Take a seat, young Pok√©mon player
            Well, the player did beat the champion at the time, so it is only fair
                But here we circle back to the original point, N wasn't officially registered as the champion.
            They did though: N. N's the Champion because he beat Alder.
    It is not about recognition, it's about how he did it. N never got the Gym Badges to Challange the Elite Four, so basically he skipped a step to be the Champion. So no, he is not a Champion.
        I thought he did get the gym badges?
            I don't think so... he went through the Elite Four, or at least two of them who mentioned someone beating them before the player... but i don't think he beat the Gym Leaders... also, the reason why he challenged the League was not to become the Champion, it was to awaken the Team Plasma's Castle which was located on the Pokemon League.
                Actually no, some of gym leaders comment on N challenging them. I distinctly remember that
                    I believe you can also see N's name on the statues of the people who won inside the gym.
                        I do not remember that, and I checked the statues for a few gyms, what? If his name only appears on the statues after the Ferris wheel scene I'd be impressed, that'd be really good attention to detail
                            I unfortunately do not remember which gyms I saw his name on the statues of but I do remember at least one of them having it
                you can run into him as he leaves Lenora's gym, and you also aren't allowed to challenge the league unless you have all the badges, so I'm pretty sure he's meant to have beaten the gym leaders.
        Is that really important?
        If someone skips those steps and still manages to beat the champion, they're still somewhat worthy of the title.
            No, it doesn't. You can't go to the champion's house, defeat him and call yourself the new champion. There is a procedure to earn that title and either you follow it our you won't get the title.
                I think since a lot of Pok√©mon players are children or youth, they‚Äôve never experienced the business world and don‚Äôt understand bureaucracy. 

The league is a bureaucracy with a lot of formal procedures and rules. In universe, the league absolutely has employee handbooks and SOPs. It‚Äôs all behind the curtain so-to-speak, to maintain the wonderment of the participants (think Disney), but in the end there‚Äôs a bunch of bean counters and HR people making decisions. Larry draws the curtain back a bit in S/V and it‚Äôs wonderful.

So you‚Äôre correct, N is in no way a champion technically or otherwise. A local football team can‚Äôt challenge the Chiefs roster to a game of flag football and call themselves the Super Bowl Champions if they win either, shocking as that may come to some people.
                    The football Team of St. Pauli is still selling merch with Weltpokalsiegerbesieger because of that one time they defeated the winner of the International Cup. People do that. Its a dumb ass thing to do though.
                        I had to look up this ‚ÄòWeltpokalsiegerbesieger‚Äô thing as it seemed like such an interesting word. Found a pretty interesting piece of history to read up on. Cheers!
                Yes, it does. He skipped the steps, so he's not totally worthy, but he proved himself stronger than the champion, which is the whole point of the challenge.
                    Bro he went to the Normal and flying gym and got the badge before you
                        When is that mentioned?
                            He tells you in Chargestone cave his goal is too win all 8 Badges. He just came out of Normal gym and tells you he has just beaten it and talks to you in the flying gym saying maybe he wouldn't have to do this if all Pokemon were as happy together as you're were.

Even the Elite 4 mentions him beating them with the ghost one writing a book about her encounter/battle with him.
                                He never says anything of the sort for the first two, and the latter could easily just mean he plans to defeat Alder, but doesn't intend to get the badges to do so.

Yes, he did at least fight the Elite Four, but the Gym Leaders aren't clear.
                                    How else would he even get in and yeah did say that even Drayden mentions he has a battle with him.
                    If the Champion knew he didn't go through the steps why would they battle at full strength.
                        Ask Alder.
    He also didn't beat the elite 4 beforehand so he didn't challenge the league, so he wouldn't be a champion at all, it's basically like finding alder on the street and challenging him to a battle
        Shauntal and Grimsley imply he did.

> **Shauntal:** "'Eyes brimming with dark flame, this man rejected everything other than himself in order to bring about one singular justice...' That's part of a novel I'm writing. I was inspired by the challenger who was just here, and somehow I got a little sad..."

> **Grimsley:** "Astonishing! You have defeated every member of the Pok√©mon League's Elite Four. But it isn't over yet. There is one more opponent against whom you must prove your strength. The pinnacle of the Pok√©mon League, the Champion, Alder... Or, perhaps, that man called N has defeated him and taken his title."
             "**Eyes brimming with dark flame**, this man rejected everything other than  himself in order to bring about one singular justice..."

[Sounds familar...](https://jojowiki.com/Dark_Determination)
If the champion is sorta like a government position to Pokemon, I'm pretty sure N just counts as a very successful terrorist
    that is so crazy like imagine peta storming the government and making some human-animal offspring the  puppet dictator
        Fuck. Maybe we'd get Gurren Lagann.
            That‚Äôd probably suck for like the first couple hundred-to-thousand years, but at least we‚Äôd get giant robots out of it.
    N, National Pokemon League Champion 2010  
Osama Bin Laden, International Hide and Seek Champion, 2001-2011  
Same energy?
Pokemon Masters is the only game that sort of acknowledge him as a champion. He can be battled in champion stadium which only has elite four and champions (and red / leaf)
    Do u mean Victory Road? Bc he is present in Victory Road alongside the other regional champions(minus Alder lol) but he is not a champion in the Champion Stadium, that is Iris and Alder rotationally.
        My "champion stadium" is referring to the [mode](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Champion_Stadium), which the victory road is also part of. Not the literal location that is also the same name üòÖ. Well he technically did not lead the elite four unlike the rest of the champion in the stadium so he wont be part of the rotation. Just like red and leaf are also not part of the rotation but is at the victory road.

EDIT: not sure why the comment is being downvoted, [but victory road is part of the champion stadium mode as shown in this screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/8Dx73E8.png)
I see it like Champion being a job title. Since N didn‚Äôt formally apply to sit waiting for kids who beat all the gyms and the elite four to challenge him, he‚Äôs not a Champion. Though it‚Äôs obviously different between regions I feel like this is how most of them including Unova work.
    I mean it seems Red didn't do that either
He wouldn‚Äôt want to be. His relationship with his Pok√©mon is not a standard ‚Äútrainer‚Äù relationship.
    Would be interesting if he became a champion and we start having a Pok√©mon version of bear the arms or idk the quilevant of it.

It became a war of "capturing Pok√©mon via pokeball" and "befriending Pok√©mon and they only fight in place of "friend"".
Not everyone who beats the champion becomes the champion. I would imagine it‚Äôs a personal choice. Blue chose to be champion, Red didn‚Äôt
    People who defeat champions become one themselves, they just don't always choose to stay at the Pokemon League and fight challengers.
    Beating the campion alone doesn't turn you into a champion otherwise the gyms and the elite four would be pointless.
Personally, yes. I feel like N falls into the same sort of position as Blue/Gary. He became the champion and immediately lost to the player character, and as far as I can tell blue acts as the champion and is considered to be one for a brief period of time. If Blue/Gary is then N should be too ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. If you dont think Blue/Gary is a champion, then N probably isn‚Äôt either(I think the same applies to Tracy,the rival from the Let‚Äôs Go games, but Idk tbh)
    The difference there is that Blue and Trace were registered in the Hall of Fame while N wasn't.
He is a champion, he just isn't officially recognized by the league because he give up that title after beating Alder.

But you're wrong that he is not recognized in any media, as Pok√©mon Masters recognized N as a champion.

Also, BW gameplay also follows that logic, as N is who you face after defeating the E4. So he is the champion-like character from the game.
Yes, N is a Champion and I'm tired of pretending he's not.
He beat the Champion, but he never officially challenged the League. I assume to actually be recognised as a Champion you have to follow the proper procedure, including getting all 8 badges and challenging the Elite 4.
    He did do all of that tho , im not sure if its in Nimbasa or  Chargestone cave , but N outright says that he'll collect all 8 badges and challenge Alder
        If I'm not mistaken, Grimsley and Shauntal sort of implied they were challenged by N too
            All 4 do
        And all E4 mention just having faced him
        I like the headcannon/idea that N didn't challenge any of the gyms until he got Reshiram/Zekrom, and so after we see him in dragonspiral tower he just goes and speedruns the gyms and nobody can stop him

(Although I'm fairly sure we know he took on at least lenora first because we see him walking out? So that ruins the headcanon to a degree)
If Unova operated on some "US logic," then legally no. Because I don't think he formally challenged Alder, like how challengers would be required to in an "American League." But, there would be many Unovans out there who'd argue that a win is a win, while others would insist it was fraudulent and not counting it was the right thing to do. (The latter is the franchise's stance, so that is why it is "correct.")
Yes he is to me at least. And he was one of the best Champs in the series
I‚Äôve thought about this so many times. I don‚Äôt see how he‚Äôs not. The only thing I can think of is because he was never officially registered in the hall of fame, but neither was Blue. He 100% should be considered a champion imo.
    Was it ever specifically stated that Blue was never registered in the Hall of Fame though? We know he wasn't Champion for that long, but it would be kinda weird if, after he beat Lance, he just kinda stood in the Champion's room without getting himself registered waiting for the player to fight him.
        Professor Oak says he was on his way, but Blue got beat before he got there. Professor Oak is the one who registers people in the hall of fame in Kanto so Blue couldn‚Äôt have been registered.
            Oak only says he was on his way to congratulate Blue after hearing he beat the e4, and was disappointed that Blue already lost by the time he got there. Nothing says that Oak HAS to be the one to register people in the hall of fame just because he did it for the player. For all we know, Lance could have done it for Blue like he does in Johto, or Blue could have done it himself.

Unlike N, who had no time to register himself between beating Alder, you walking in, and telling you to go fight him in the castle, there's an unspecified amount of time between Blue beating Lance and you beating him. There's also the fact that Blue's trainer class is Champion during that fight (unlike N's final fight), Blue fights as a Champion in the PWT, and Blue refers to himself AND Red as former Kanto champions in SM.

There's no reason to believe Blue isn't registered in the Hall of Fame unless there's specific dialogue saying otherwise.
                Except for the fact that Oak somehow instantly appears when Ethan beats Lance and is there when he is inducted into the hall of fame which implies that Blue lost before he was inducted
                    If you're bringing Johto into this, that's just more proof that Blue was registered, seeing as Lance took Ethan into the room and not Oak.

In Kanto, Oak was on his way to congratulate Blue. In Johto, Oak was literally dragged there by Mary, and Lance was surprised and annoyed that they were even there. 

Again, unless someone can find something that directly states Blue isn't in the hall of fame, there's no reason to believe otherwise.
    Technically speaking he's not a champion, so he's not. You might consider him to be champion worthy or whatever but he was never a champion.
        Who isn‚Äôt? Blue or N? Blue is absolutely considered a champion, N is in the same situation as Blue, but just isn‚Äôt considered one.
Tbh I thought he was on my first playthrough. I didn't know you could face aldar after the story.
It‚Äôs been a while since I played bw1 but didn‚Äôt he reject the title? Meaning N is a champion level trainer in terms of skill and bond with his Pok√©mon (he defeated the elite four and champion) but just doesn‚Äôt officially have a title.
He does beated Alder, but he never accept that title. So, he's unofficially a champion.
Yes. The idea of a champion in any competition is that if you beat them, you become champion. Just because Professor Juniper didn't show up and give him the hall of fame speech doesn't mean he isn't a champion.
I wont calls him Champions, but the  "Champion level trainer", the trainer who have Champion level strength but with no official champion title

I'm pretty sure there's always the people you don't know who are strong enough to defeat the certified champions in pokemon world
He'd actually need the badges, defeat ALL of the elite, and register into the Hall of Fame in order to be seen as champion. Any other piece of media with him being considered champion is just basically fanservice, so no.
I think the most honest answer is that, while he effectively accomplished everything needed to become a Champion, he technically isn‚Äôt a Champion, as he did not have his team registered into the Pok√©dex
He‚Äôs champion level but not officially a champion. If I play the world champion of a card game or something and win but it‚Äôs not an official match I‚Äôm not the champion, but I could be considered to be on his level.
Hes as much of a champion as kukui/hau is, tbh. Theyre not champions but they are the last person you fight before becoming one and just like those two theyre not considered ‚Äúchampions‚Äù by any media. Blue is also not ‚Äúreally‚Äù counted as a champion in many medias btw, only being mentiod being a really strong trainer or a champion level trainer by people in the game but not like in the anime or other official media. i think its just to preserve canon or something
    >only being mentiod being a really strong trainer or a champion level trainer by people in the game

Blue literally take part in PWT in b2w2 as a champion. In gen 7, blue introduce red and himself as "champions of the kanto region, in our own days".
Should be be considered a champion? No because the league doesn't recognize him as such. Is he Champion level battle wise? Yes
No because he just parked his castle on top of the champion and beat him there's no indication he beat the elite four maybe didn't beat the gyms and probably went straight to the champion and the pokemon league cannot validate this because it would be a bigger blow than how alder was defeated
N is technically a champion, however after defeating alder, he rejected the title
Technically he is a champion, he got the badges, beat the E4 and the champion at the time. However I feel like it‚Äôs similar to S/V where you have multiple champion level trainers. 

So yes he is a champion but he is not THE champion so to speak.
Yes Partnered with my Favorite character igga
Beating the champion doesn't make you champion, you have to beat the entire league
    Dialogues from the elite four implied he did defeated them.
No
In pokemon master he does get referred a few times as a Champion and we do see him in the victory road mode with all the other champions

but none of this sync pairs have the "champion" skill

still Master also has something called Neo champions and they are doing them for all the regions and they haven't yet done unova

so there is a possibility that in the future we get a neo champion N
Yes, so that means he is a champion, rival and a (fake) evil team leader.
no, but he is a final boss, just like Volo and the Professor in SV.
He never underwent the gym challenge, Never registered as a trainer with the league even, Theirs alot more to being a champion than just being a strong trainer, The league system is it's own beast and their are rules he would hate to abide by, You can consider him an Elite level independent trainer, That's fair and you wouldn't find many that would argue but yeah definitely not a champion or elite 4 or anything league related and tbf thats entirely intentional and he prefers it that way
Yes. He‚Äôs basically every rank: evil team leader, rival, and champion.
To answer this you need to ask "What you need to become a Champion". The answer is to beat the 8 Gyms to even consider challenging the Elite Four, then beat the Elite Four so you can challenge the Champion, then beat th3 Champion to become a Champion yourself... there's one of these steps that N necer did, so even if he beat the Champion, he cannot be considered a Champion... not in Pokemon League at least...
    It's possible N did obtain the badges, as a ranger in Virizion's chamber during B2W2 says "This happened around when the hero appeared in Opelucid City with the legendary dragon Pokemon." which seems to be referring to N.
        You need to be registered as a Pok√©mon trainer and you need to challenge the gym leaders, the elite four and the champion following the rules and I don't think he did all that so, no, technically speaking he never was the champion.
            Do you need to be registered to challenge Gyms? I don't recall such a thing being mentioned.
                There‚Äôs a LOT of paperwork off screen
                    Source?
Spoiler tag!!!!!!

That was the main  (and maybe the only) plot twist in almost 30y of Pok√©mon and you give it this way...
Lance was the champion in Gen 2 but was by no means the strongest trainer in those games.

Edit: as in, Red was the strongest and he wasn't champion. Don't know what I'm getting downvoted for.
We can agree that black and white is just a terrible knock off of red and blue.
Its also kinda odd how in kanto the elite four just didnt have a champion before Blue came along. Or it made it seem like standard elite four is the entire pokemon league challenge, but Blue beating it just before you changed things. But every league after has had a champion waiting after the elite 4.
    in pokemon let's go, it is implied that in the past, you only need to beat the elite four and you go into hall of fame direct. now, the champion battle will be part of the pokemon league challenge and your rival happens to be the first to beat the elite four after this new change. this is of course pokemon lgpe, so up to you if you want to apply this back to rby and frlg.
    I think some of the left over code implies that originally Oak was supposed to be the champion and then they decided to change it to Blue. It could have possibly be that Blue battled Oak.
    Who says Kanto didn't have a champion? Blue could've taken Lance's position and some fourth character was kicked out of the Elite Four.
        regardless its still missing a 5th member. and just pushes the question to a different person.
In theory no, but practically I can't think of any champion who can beat him.
He beat Alder, but he‚Äôs not the Champion. The ‚ÄúLeague Challenge‚Äù is (depending on the region) beating the Gym Leaders, Elite Four and the Champion. N didn‚Äôt take the League Challenge, so he‚Äôs not a Champion.
I think the battled Alder but never officially engaged in the official league challenge, like I dont remember him having fought the 8 gyms and elite four prior to fighting Alder
    Elite four's dialogue implied he did challenge them
In universe he probably doesn't count because he was basically a part of a terrorist organisation.
Should 'N' be considered a pokemon?
N rejected the title. He doesn't count.
N disliked pokemon battles, and none of the gym leaders mentioned him. Hard to believe he collected all badges. With this idea his sweep of the league should not be official.
Being stronger than the champion doesnt make you a champion. 

Using that logic, heavyweight boxers should be champions of lower classes by default.
>There's a lot of people stating that N couldn't be champion because he didn't do the gym challenge/beat the E4, but he actually did, though it's a bit downplayed. 

Where's that shown in the game? I could absolutely have missed it, but I'm *big* into the Gen 5 games and I've never heard this before.
    He definitely defeat the elite four as they mentioned it.

Shauntal:

>"'Eyes brimming with dark flame, this man rejected everything other than himself in order to bring about one singular justice...' That's part of a novel I'm writing. I was inspired by **the challenger who was just here**, and somehow I got a little sad... Excuse me. You're a challenger, right? I'm the Elite Four's Ghost-type Pok√©mon user, Shauntal, and I shall be your opponent."

Grimsley

>"Man oh man... What is going on today? **Challengers coming one right after another**. Well, no matter. I am Grimsley of the Elite Four, and I will fulfill my duty to be your opponent."

Argument can be made for the gym leaders though if he did or did not.
Don‚Äôt you need all of the gym badges to be considered the champion?
I think he's more of a rival.

Similar to Blue, people rarely knows them primarily as the rival of the protagonist.
I think it's entirely dependent on actually getting registered in the system, and due to the concurrent terrorist attack, I don't think N was registered.   


Regardless of N's journey, as he supposedly DOES legitimately conquer the 8 Gyms and the E4  it's more a point of contention because as far as we're aware, he's just the weird guy who's part of the bad guy team and has the big scary legendary dragon NOT on the cover of your game. He shows up at inconvenient times to talk shit and be wrong about everything, and right at the climax of OUR journey, he shows up to Allahu Akbar his way past Alder with no effort because he's just using the big Uber, and then like, he consumes the Pokemon League with a giant Gurren Lagann fortress immediately after demoralizing Alder.
Technically yes, but logically no. He beat a champion, but committed a terrorist attack (basically) and lead a group of people who steal from people so if he didn‚Äôt summon the castle and tried to become the Champio(tm) he‚Äôd most likely be ‚Äúfired‚Äù immediately
N didn't collect 8 gym badges, and basically broke into the Pokemon league to wipe the elite 4 and alder. If he challenged them legitimately then yes, he would be considered a champ, but since he didn't I think it's fair that he doesn't get the title.
Technically the player also did not enter the hall of fame the first time since the battle is interuppted by team plasma and is still considered champion (though the game still register the team but this should not be considered in game lore).

I would say N technically is one, but he reject the title or something.
    The player isn't considered a champion after the main story. Their party being registered is either purely for gameplay so the player can look back on their first team. Or after Ghetsis was arrested, the player was registered in the Hall of Fame as a reward for defeating Team Plasma, but wasn't outright deemed a champion since they technically didn't defeat one.
        Looking at the text dump, you are right. This must be the first game where you begin the post game as technically not a champion i guess.

    If someone skips those steps and still manages to beat the champion, they're still somewhat worthy of the title.
        No, it doesn't. You can't go to the champion's house, defeat him and call yourself the new champion. There is a procedure to earn that title and either you follow it our you won't get the title.
            I think since a lot of Pok√©mon players are children or youth, they‚Äôve never experienced the business world and don‚Äôt understand bureaucracy. 

The league is a bureaucracy with a lot of formal procedures and rules. In universe, the league absolutely has employee handbooks and SOPs.

Larry draws the curtain back a bit in S/V and it‚Äôs wonderful.

So you‚Äôre correct, N is in no way a champion technically or otherwise. A local football team can‚Äôt challenge the Chiefs roster to a game of flag football and call themselves the Super Bowl Champions if they win either, shocking as that may come to some people.
                The football Team of St. Pauli is still selling merch with Weltpokalsiegerbesieger because of that one time they defeated the winner of the International Cup. People do that. Its a dumb ass thing to do though.

            Yes, it does. He skipped the steps, so he's not totally worthy, but he proved himself stronger than the champion, which is the whole point of the challenge.
                Bro he went to the Normal and flying gym and got the badge before you
                    When is that mentioned?
                        He tells you in Chargestone cave his goal is too win all 8 Badges. He just came out of Normal gym and tells you he has just beaten it and talks to you in the flying gym saying maybe he wouldn't have to do this if all Pokemon were as happy together as you're were.

Even the Elite 4 mentions him beating them with the ghost one writing a book about her encounter/battle with him.
                            He never says anything of the sort for the first two, and the latter could easily just mean he plans to defeat Alder, but doesn't intend to get the badges to do so.

Yes, he did at least fight the Elite Four, but the Gym Leaders aren't clear.
                                How else would he even get in and yeah did say that even Drayden mentions he has a battle with him.
                If the Champion knew he didn't go through the steps why would they battle at full strength.
                    Ask Alder.
He also didn't beat the elite 4 beforehand so he didn't challenge the league, so he wouldn't be a champion at all, it's basically like finding alder on the street and challenging him to a battle
    Shauntal and Grimsley imply he did.

N, National Pokemon League Champion 2010  
Osama Bin Laden, International Hide and Seek Champion, 2001-2011  
Same energy?
Do u mean Victory Road? Bc he is present in Victory Road alongside the other regional champions(minus Alder lol) but he is not a champion in the Champion Stadium, that is Iris and Alder rotationally.
    My "champion stadium" is referring to the [mode](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Champion_Stadium), which the victory road is also part of. Not the literal location that is also the same name üòÖ. Well he technically did not lead the elite four unlike the rest of the champion in the stadium so he wont be part of the rotation. Just like red and leaf are also not part of the rotation but is at the victory road.

EDIT: not sure why the comment is being downvoted, [but victory road is part of the champion stadium mode as shown in this screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/8Dx73E8.png)
I mean it seems Red didn't do that either
Would be interesting if he became a champion and we start having a Pok√©mon version of bear the arms or idk the quilevant of it.

It became a war of "capturing Pok√©mon via pokeball" and "befriending Pok√©mon and they only fight in place of "friend"".
People who defeat champions become one themselves, they just don't always choose to stay at the Pokemon League and fight challengers.
Beating the campion alone doesn't turn you into a champion otherwise the gyms and the elite four would be pointless.
The difference there is that Blue and Trace were registered in the Hall of Fame while N wasn't.
He did do all of that tho , im not sure if its in Nimbasa or  Chargestone cave , but N outright says that he'll collect all 8 badges and challenge Alder
    If I'm not mistaken, Grimsley and Shauntal sort of implied they were challenged by N too
        All 4 do
    And all E4 mention just having faced him
    I like the headcannon/idea that N didn't challenge any of the gyms until he got Reshiram/Zekrom, and so after we see him in dragonspiral tower he just goes and speedruns the gyms and nobody can stop him

(Although I'm fairly sure we know he took on at least lenora first because we see him walking out? So that ruins the headcanon to a degree)
Was it ever specifically stated that Blue was never registered in the Hall of Fame though? We know he wasn't Champion for that long, but it would be kinda weird if, after he beat Lance, he just kinda stood in the Champion's room without getting himself registered waiting for the player to fight him.
    Professor Oak says he was on his way, but Blue got beat before he got there. Professor Oak is the one who registers people in the hall of fame in Kanto so Blue couldn‚Äôt have been registered.
        Oak only says he was on his way to congratulate Blue after hearing he beat the e4, and was disappointed that Blue already lost by the time he got there. Nothing says that Oak HAS to be the one to register people in the hall of fame just because he did it for the player. For all we know, Lance could have done it for Blue like he does in Johto, or Blue could have done it himself.

Unlike N, who had no time to register himself between beating Alder, you walking in, and telling you to go fight him in the castle, there's an unspecified amount of time between Blue beating Lance and you beating him. There's also the fact that Blue's trainer class is Champion during that fight (unlike N's final fight), Blue fights as a Champion in the PWT, and Blue refers to himself AND Red as former Kanto champions in SM.

There's no reason to believe Blue isn't registered in the Hall of Fame unless there's specific dialogue saying otherwise.
            Except for the fact that Oak somehow instantly appears when Ethan beats Lance and is there when he is inducted into the hall of fame which implies that Blue lost before he was inducted
                If you're bringing Johto into this, that's just more proof that Blue was registered, seeing as Lance took Ethan into the room and not Oak.

In Kanto, Oak was on his way to congratulate Blue. In Johto, Oak was literally dragged there by Mary, and Lance was surprised and annoyed that they were even there. 

Again, unless someone can find something that directly states Blue isn't in the hall of fame, there's no reason to believe otherwise.
Technically speaking he's not a champion, so he's not. You might consider him to be champion worthy or whatever but he was never a champion.
    Who isn‚Äôt? Blue or N? Blue is absolutely considered a champion, N is in the same situation as Blue, but just isn‚Äôt considered one.
>only being mentiod being a really strong trainer or a champion level trainer by people in the game

Blue literally take part in PWT in b2w2 as a champion. In gen 7, blue introduce red and himself as "champions of the kanto region, in our own days".
Dialogues from the elite four implied he did defeated them.
It's possible N did obtain the badges, as a ranger in Virizion's chamber during B2W2 says "This happened around when the hero appeared in Opelucid City with the legendary dragon Pokemon." which seems to be referring to N.
    You need to be registered as a Pok√©mon trainer and you need to challenge the gym leaders, the elite four and the champion following the rules and I don't think he did all that so, no, technically speaking he never was the champion.
        Do you need to be registered to challenge Gyms? I don't recall such a thing being mentioned.
            There‚Äôs a LOT of paperwork off screen
                Source?
in pokemon let's go, it is implied that in the past, you only need to beat the elite four and you go into hall of fame direct. now, the champion battle will be part of the pokemon league challenge and your rival happens to be the first to beat the elite four after this new change. this is of course pokemon lgpe, so up to you if you want to apply this back to rby and frlg.
I think some of the left over code implies that originally Oak was supposed to be the champion and then they decided to change it to Blue. It could have possibly be that Blue battled Oak.
Who says Kanto didn't have a champion? Blue could've taken Lance's position and some fourth character was kicked out of the Elite Four.
    regardless its still missing a 5th member. and just pushes the question to a different person.
Elite four's dialogue implied he did challenge them
He definitely defeat the elite four as they mentioned it.

Shauntal:

>"'Eyes brimming with dark flame, this man rejected everything other than himself in order to bring about one singular justice...' That's part of a novel I'm writing. I was inspired by **the challenger who was just here**, and somehow I got a little sad... Excuse me. You're a challenger, right? I'm the Elite Four's Ghost-type Pok√©mon user, Shauntal, and I shall be your opponent."

Grimsley

>"Man oh man... What is going on today? **Challengers coming one right after another**. Well, no matter. I am Grimsley of the Elite Four, and I will fulfill my duty to be your opponent."

Argument can be made for the gym leaders though if he did or did not.
The player isn't considered a champion after the main story. Their party being registered is either purely for gameplay so the player can look back on their first team. Or after Ghetsis was arrested, the player was registered in the Hall of Fame as a reward for defeating Team Plasma, but wasn't outright deemed a champion since they technically didn't defeat one.
    Looking at the text dump, you are right. This must be the first game where you begin the post game as technically not a champion i guess.

    This is outrageous! It's unfair!
        Take a seat, young Pok√©mon player
    Well, the player did beat the champion at the time, so it is only fair
        But here we circle back to the original point, N wasn't officially registered as the champion.
    They did though: N. N's the Champion because he beat Alder.
I thought he did get the gym badges?
    I don't think so... he went through the Elite Four, or at least two of them who mentioned someone beating them before the player... but i don't think he beat the Gym Leaders... also, the reason why he challenged the League was not to become the Champion, it was to awaken the Team Plasma's Castle which was located on the Pokemon League.
        Actually no, some of gym leaders comment on N challenging them. I distinctly remember that
            I believe you can also see N's name on the statues of the people who won inside the gym.
                I do not remember that, and I checked the statues for a few gyms, what? If his name only appears on the statues after the Ferris wheel scene I'd be impressed, that'd be really good attention to detail
                    I unfortunately do not remember which gyms I saw his name on the statues of but I do remember at least one of them having it
        you can run into him as he leaves Lenora's gym, and you also aren't allowed to challenge the league unless you have all the badges, so I'm pretty sure he's meant to have beaten the gym leaders.
Is that really important?
If someone skips those steps and still manages to beat the champion, they're still somewhat worthy of the title.
    No, it doesn't. You can't go to the champion's house, defeat him and call yourself the new champion. There is a procedure to earn that title and either you follow it our you won't get the title.
        I think since a lot of Pok√©mon players are children or youth, they‚Äôve never experienced the business world and don‚Äôt understand bureaucracy. 

The league is a bureaucracy with a lot of formal procedures and rules. In universe, the league absolutely has employee handbooks and SOPs. It‚Äôs all behind the curtain so-to-speak, to maintain the wonderment of the participants (think Disney), but in the end there‚Äôs a bunch of bean counters and HR people making decisions. Larry draws the curtain back a bit in S/V and it‚Äôs wonderful.

So you‚Äôre correct, N is in no way a champion technically or otherwise. A local football team can‚Äôt challenge the Chiefs roster to a game of flag football and call themselves the Super Bowl Champions if they win either, shocking as that may come to some people.

    I had to look up this ‚ÄòWeltpokalsiegerbesieger‚Äô thing as it seemed like such an interesting word. Found a pretty interesting piece of history to read up on. Cheers!
Bro he went to the Normal and flying gym and got the badge before you
    When is that mentioned?
        He tells you in Chargestone cave his goal is too win all 8 Badges. He just came out of Normal gym and tells you he has just beaten it and talks to you in the flying gym saying maybe he wouldn't have to do this if all Pokemon were as happy together as you're were.

Even the Elite 4 mentions him beating them with the ghost one writing a book about her encounter/battle with him.
            He never says anything of the sort for the first two, and the latter could easily just mean he plans to defeat Alder, but doesn't intend to get the badges to do so.

Yes, he did at least fight the Elite Four, but the Gym Leaders aren't clear.
                How else would he even get in and yeah did say that even Drayden mentions he has a battle with him.
If the Champion knew he didn't go through the steps why would they battle at full strength.
    Ask Alder.
If you're bringing Johto into this, that's just more proof that Blue was registered, seeing as Lance took Ethan into the room and not Oak.

In Kanto, Oak was on his way to congratulate Blue. In Johto, Oak was literally dragged there by Mary, and Lance was surprised and annoyed that they were even there. 

Again, unless someone can find something that directly states Blue isn't in the hall of fame, there's no reason to believe otherwise.
Source?
I do not remember that, and I checked the statues for a few gyms, what? If his name only appears on the statues after the Ferris wheel scene I'd be impressed, that'd be really good attention to detail
