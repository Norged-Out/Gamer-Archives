[[What did you guys think of N (Natural Harmonia Gropius) I think he was one of the best made Pok√©mon characters in their history.]]





This is our fault. We laughed at the b and w games and they stopped making them.
    If we never made fun of BW, and they decided to stop making games with truly deep and compelling stories, godly quality/quantity of Pok√©mon designs (although a lot of new ones are amazing too), and the SOUNDTRACK. Oh gosh, the soundtrack was amazing.
        They literally had multiple towns where you could talk mucisians who could add instruments to the over all score.
    Are you saying b&w 3
        BW3: it‚Äôs 10 years after the events of b2w2, and your dad is N.
            That sounds like an endless wormhole that might not be the best place to go, but that aside N as a dad would be kind of cool to see.
        I think dollar signs on nintendo eyes says it all.
            I no longer want b&w 3 anymore
                I want pokemon z. And be able to go to galar from there.
                    we have Pok√©mon "z" now lol
                        And NO ONE had that on their bingo card XDXDXD
                        Oh yeah, everyone talked how we must get pokemon z since galar would be next to kalos lol. 

And even though people recognised paldea could be next to kalos, no one even joked about z XDXD
                Honestly, me either. But we NEED to see that original Dragon.
    I'm still Mad üòê
        Maybe soon we will have vindicitation!
His last name makes him sound like a sex offender.
I think N added a certain dynamic of depth to an otherwise standard story. I like Galactic and Cyrus for having more motivation, but N just had a lot of depth.
    Love the scene in Platinum where Cyrus is giving his speech to his followers. Always thought of Team Galactic as a cult (their hair was the main reason why)
N‚Äôs my favorite male character! When playing black, I thought of him as an interesting kid, bit weird, but not enough to stand out, until that final scene. And the feels hit me like a ton of bricks and here I was pleading down at my 3ds for him not to leave. I love his character arc, and I wish Pok√©mon would bring him back someday.
    Imagine seeming him in the SwSh DLC
        I would be lying to say that all the Unova legends and mythical allowed in Sword and Shield don‚Äôt fuel my hope that N reached the Galar region. My favorite theory is that the mysterious dragon heads in some of the cities are Reshiram, Zekrom and Kyurem fused together thanks to N
Farewell..

*epic end theme*
    I also personally love Unwavering Heart, Prisoner to a Formula, and Onward to Our Own Futures.
9/10
1 point removed because who in their right mind names a child that?
    I mean, Ghetsis is kinda crazy.
        Undoubtedly.
            Actually that‚Äôs just Ghetsis‚Äôs last name, his full name is Ghetsis Harmonia Gropius.
    I feel like that's more a point taken from Ghetsis, not N.
N was such a great character. Abandoned by his parents, raised by Pok√©mon that were abused by humans, and manipulated by Ghetsis (possibly N‚Äôs father?) into being Team Plasma‚Äôs figurehead, only to realize that everything Team Plasma had taught him was false. He eventually had to live his own life after Team Plasma fell.

I never got the Harmonia thing though. Is N Harmonia Gropius his official name?
    I totally agree with your assessment of N. And yes, Natural Harmonia Gropius is the character‚Äôs ‚Äúofficial‚Äù name. N is technically just a nickname.
        Hmmm. I guess that‚Äôs why he had ‚ÄúHarmonia‚Äù written on his basketball. When I first saw it I thought it was some kind of Wilson-like thing.
            Apparently Ghetsis‚Äôs last name is ‚ÄúHarmonia Gropius.‚Äù  Ghetsis‚Äôs full name is Ghetsis Harmonia Gropious.
An extremely good character for sure. And I think he gives a bit of depth into Pok√©mon themselves. The fact that a Zoroark could do all these human things, and act so human-like...it goes to show how intelligent some Pok√©mon can be
    The Zoroark thing is just a theory, you know.
        Bruh this is 2 years old lol
            Yeah, it popped up when I googled something :)
                Ah üëå
I think he's the saving grace of BW's story. He's the only liberation advocate who isn't unambiguously evil. Now there should definitely have been more characters than just him who support that side of the argument, but better him than nothing.
still laughing about his last name.  They should have given another character the last name Mies and named one Le Corbusier.
N was an awesome character, very well written. Although, I wouldn't say he's the best anti-villain.
    He‚Äôs a story of someone realizing he‚Äôs in the wrong and changing himself to help instead of harm, like Tony Stark (in a way).
        Yeah but even I still don‚Äôt understand his whole story, as there‚Äôs still a lot we don‚Äôt know about him, plus, do you think I knew what his motives were when I first saw a playthrough of black and white?
Of course I liked N. He was my favorite character ever
I love N, he's so advocating to his goals- liberating pokemon that you can literally feel it, and he has one of the best story in the games. I like how instead of just pokemon's classic "I'm gonna get stronger and win against you/ I'm gonna get that <legendary pokemon> to complete my goals", he actually seeks for a validation, not strenth, of what's he following is true and when his twisted-by-Ghetsis vision is broken, he readily give it up and seek for a new way to live his life, and it's clear in B2W2. I also like how Cheren and Bianca barely mentioned the BW protag but N constantly remind the new protag what he had been taught and how much he wanted to find and meet that person again.
    I feel like this is the best way to put it into words. He is the true rival in the games (Cheren and Bianca are friends), and you help him change, see things differently, and grow as a person. Now we just need him in another game.
Maybe I'm biased because BW were the first video games I ever played but, to me, he was, and still is, one of the best characters in the games. He had awesome music, a motive made me question if the protag was really the good guy, and a pretty good backstory.  
Also his last name is funny, so that's a plus.
Anime N was the best part by far of the absolute disaster that was the BW anime. (And single handedly saved the Plasma Arc, *though I do ironically like Anime Ghetsis*).
I 100% agree. I wonder what he ended up doing after B2/W2?
Yes, and I think Black and White have the best story in any Pok√©mon game by far
Is that actually his fucking name
I honestly don't remember much about him.
If I could live in the black and white era forever I wouldn‚Äôt be disappointed. To me it is barely second to Red/Blue gen nostalgia.

IVE COME TO TALK ABOUT THE N CHARACTER
Yeah i agree because out of all antagonist he has the best cause he just wants to help Pok√©mon
uhh, i think hes hot
He is one of, if not the best written character(s) in the whole franchise. Gamefreak was at their apex in 2010. Gen 5 was their masterpiece, and N is just part of that.

The only time in all of Pokemon that I've cried. And I'm an 18 year old guy. I still tear up when I hear that theme...
I haven't beat a gen 5 game but he's a great character, his fast talking makes me think of Wendy Oldbag from Ace Attorney so take that as you will.
I can't say N made much impact on me. I let the Pokemon team speak for the trainer. Gary and his team is all about power. Silver shows his shift from only using Pokemon for tools to caring and befriending them through Zubat. Wally shows his growth in confidence from starting with a weak Ralts to ending with a strong Gardevoir. What do N's teams say? Nothing. Legendary aside, they're just a hodge podge of different Pokemon. Also his team always shifts around without rhyme or reason, making his motivation seem amorphous and vague. The team of a major character should have strong resonance, and N just doesn't have that.
    The fact that N only catches Pok√©mon from the routes he's in and after every battle frees them doesn't resonate with his characterization and motivation? Are you serious?
        Wowee, what a timely response.

Yes and I still stand by this. There's practically no difference between fighting N and fighting an errant trainer in a nearby route. If N really only used Pokemon he recently found, the game didn't do a good job of evoking that.

Now riddle me this. Are you seriously digging around one year old posts, necromancer? What's your motive?
            Ahahahah ok maybe timing is not really my thing. Sorry I may have sound a bit angry I guess?   


But anyway, the reason I'm digging old posts (other than having a problem with procastination) is that I've recently been a bit bored and disappointed by Pok√©mon games and I was wondering if this sentiment of mine is shared by others. So I made the terrible mistake of checking out the Pok√©mon sales and noticed that Black and White didn't sell that well.   


Now I've known Pok√©mon since Gen 3 but I played it for the first time in Gen 5. Being quite young at the time I was pretty clueless about forums and ence I didn't know Black and White were hated. When I found out few time ago I was wondering...Why?  


Here my endless trip through posts begins, and I found myself shocked by the comments against gen 5 because they seemed to lack any kind of objectivity and most of them could have been simplified in 4 statements:  
\- I don't like the new designs  
\-I want to use the same Pok√©mon from older generations all over again  
\-The story is bad  
\-The region is linear and uninspired.

To me these points seems absurd, however the first 2 are the most forgivable because in the end is subjective, but it's really a dumb reason to criticize and entire generation, mostly because at the time hating gen 5 designs seemed more like a trend.  
As for the story part, I truly can't believe that someone said the story was bad while until that point we had some of the dumbest characters, villains and plans in the history of Pok√©mon. I truly believe that anyone with a bit of critical sense could have been able to see the good things that B/W was doing in terms of plot and characterization especially in the context of Pok√©mon, and this is not something that can be considered subjective.   
Then about the region, yeah the cities are disposed in a line but the routes themselves are complex and itricate so I don't really see the problem here. Also the region was anything but uninspired, every city was truly unique and memorable being for the weather, the buildings, the music or the biome in wich they were situated. I feel like this is another very dumb critique considering that past games had cities that were more similar beetwen one another and with identical gym buildings unlike gen 5.   


So after this and many other thoughts that passed through my mind I was left even more spechless by how much these games were hated.   
Basically I still cannot believe that the Pok√©mon game that tried and succeded in many areas more than any other Pok√©mon game before was destroyed by the fans because of nostalgia and vague and unfair critiques. The battlefield in wich Gen 5 landed was so unfair that even X and Y were considered better even though they had a ridiculous plot, wasted characters, terrible dialogues and a huge amount of nostalgia bait.   


Ok sorry for the rant but I needed it, because I know I won't get any other Pok√©mon game like Black and White anytime soon, but I hope you enjoyed my response :).
I love N! He‚Äôs been my favorite ever since I was 8 years old.
I am so hyperfixated on him and his character. He‚Äôs genuinely just phenomenal overall. N‚Äôs Farewell is the first time a video game ever made me cry.
Black and White would've gone over a million times better if they had done 1 simple thing:let people use their old favorites. As dexit clearly showed, people are very, VERY passionate about their favorite pokemon. By having just the new cast in Unova until postgame they alienated a lot of people. As well, the obvious gen 1 clones (Timburr/Machop, Gigalith/Golem, Klingklang/Manezone) were annoying for me because it was just the gen 1 guys, but a little different. Without those 2 things I think these games would've been beloved.
    The Unova situation was very different than Dexit. In Unova, you can find a lot of those Pok√©mon in post-game and be able to get everyone in the game. Dexit just did a Darth Maul on the Dex then gave it some robot legs of new Pok√©mon. 
The Gen 1 ‚Äúclones‚Äù though, they are definitely better designed than angry rock with arms, buff child, and eye (metal)ball with 2 magnets. Now you have the much superior happy baby boi rock that comes from the Earth‚Äôs mantel, buff child with wood, and gears with faces.
        Hey man, I think gen 5 is cool. Excadrill is in my top 10 all time. I just think had they had a more inclusive dex from the jump the games general reception would've been less negative.
            Yes, and White was my first Pok√©mon game, and so far my favorite. Besides the dex thing, I think a lot of people didn‚Äôt like some of the designs. But to be fair, if you‚Äôre making a pokemon based on trash and you made Trubbish you are a really good artist. I mean, seriously it looks kinda cute?
                I dont dig some of the designs (Allomomola, swanna to name a few) but some of them are absolute bangers (the aforementioned excadrill, Scrafty, Volcorona, etc.)
                My first game was Platinum, White 2nd. I preferred platinum at the time because it was 1st of course. Looking back my favorite generation is 6 by a wide margin, with 7th in last.
        I just want to add that transferring and trading Pokemon in game can be done. Sure you need at least one copy that is post game but there's nothing stopping you from playing most of the game with pokemon from other regions.
    The first problem was luckily fixed in BW2, but for the second one, I honestly think most of the gen 1 ‚Äúclones‚Äù were a lot better than the originals, with the exception of the timburr line and Klink line.
        Itd be interesting to go through and do versus. I think Chansey kills audino, but Gigalith beats golem, just to name a few.
            True. Although I personally like Audino better *solely* for the fact that it‚Äôs the easiest way to level up in BW/2. But to name a few others, I think Hitmonlee and Hitmonchan beat Sawk and Throh, but Bouffalant beats Tauros, while Rapidash and Zebstrika are about equal.
                I give the edge to Zebstrika, unless were talking Galar form. Crobat kicks Swoobats ass pretty handily.
                    Does Crobat technically count as a gen 1 pokemon? If we are then yeah, Crobat wins that easy. I‚Äôd say Seismitoad beats Poliwrath (and Politoed if we‚Äôre counting future evolutions) pretty easily.
                        Politoad has that Drizzle, so i think its push. I'll give Seis the rub on Poliwrath though.
                            I guess you‚Äôve got a point with that. For Tentacruel and Jellicent, I think Tentacruel edges out Jellicent by just a bit.
                                I like pink jelly more than the blue one, but neither makes my top 100 lol. Meinshau reminds me a lot of medicham for some reason, but like, better lol.
                                    True, Mienshao is pretty cool, and I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a single person who would rank Tentacruel or Jellicent as one of their favorite Pok√©mon üòÇ. But anyways, the next lineup I can think of is Hypno and Musharna, and it might just be me, but I think Musharna is an easy win.
I don't know that I'd say he is the best, but he certainly stood out among all the same-like characters in basically every other game.
He's probably my favorite character, or second favorite at least. I believe he has the best backstory of nearly anyone in the series. I always hope I'll see him in one of the new games
His name is dumb.
The greatest character in Pokemon
N was the rival we didn't have in bw. I'm my opinion, cheren was insufferable and Bianca was way too shy to be a rival. N is one of my favorite characters overall
Better than most of the shitty characters in pokemon
Honestly, N is by far my favorite character in the entire franchise. It‚Äôs a shame we didn‚Äôt get more of him
If we never made fun of BW, and they decided to stop making games with truly deep and compelling stories, godly quality/quantity of Pok√©mon designs (although a lot of new ones are amazing too), and the SOUNDTRACK. Oh gosh, the soundtrack was amazing.
    They literally had multiple towns where you could talk mucisians who could add instruments to the over all score.
Are you saying b&w 3
    BW3: it‚Äôs 10 years after the events of b2w2, and your dad is N.
        That sounds like an endless wormhole that might not be the best place to go, but that aside N as a dad would be kind of cool to see.
    I think dollar signs on nintendo eyes says it all.

    Actually that‚Äôs just Ghetsis‚Äôs last name, his full name is Ghetsis Harmonia Gropius.
Hmmm. I guess that‚Äôs why he had ‚ÄúHarmonia‚Äù written on his basketball. When I first saw it I thought it was some kind of Wilson-like thing.
    Apparently Ghetsis‚Äôs last name is ‚ÄúHarmonia Gropius.‚Äù  Ghetsis‚Äôs full name is Ghetsis Harmonia Gropious.
Bruh this is 2 years old lol
    Yeah, it popped up when I googled something :)
        Ah üëå
Yeah but even I still don‚Äôt understand his whole story, as there‚Äôs still a lot we don‚Äôt know about him, plus, do you think I knew what his motives were when I first saw a playthrough of black and white?
Wowee, what a timely response.

Yes and I still stand by this. There's practically no difference between fighting N and fighting an errant trainer in a nearby route. If N really only used Pokemon he recently found, the game didn't do a good job of evoking that.

Now riddle me this. Are you seriously digging around one year old posts, necromancer? What's your motive?
    Ahahahah ok maybe timing is not really my thing. Sorry I may have sound a bit angry I guess?   


But anyway, the reason I'm digging old posts (other than having a problem with procastination) is that I've recently been a bit bored and disappointed by Pok√©mon games and I was wondering if this sentiment of mine is shared by others. So I made the terrible mistake of checking out the Pok√©mon sales and noticed that Black and White didn't sell that well.   


Now I've known Pok√©mon since Gen 3 but I played it for the first time in Gen 5. Being quite young at the time I was pretty clueless about forums and ence I didn't know Black and White were hated. When I found out few time ago I was wondering...Why?  


Here my endless trip through posts begins, and I found myself shocked by the comments against gen 5 because they seemed to lack any kind of objectivity and most of them could have been simplified in 4 statements:  
\- I don't like the new designs  
\-I want to use the same Pok√©mon from older generations all over again  
\-The story is bad  
\-The region is linear and uninspired.

To me these points seems absurd, however the first 2 are the most forgivable because in the end is subjective, but it's really a dumb reason to criticize and entire generation, mostly because at the time hating gen 5 designs seemed more like a trend.  
As for the story part, I truly can't believe that someone said the story was bad while until that point we had some of the dumbest characters, villains and plans in the history of Pok√©mon. I truly believe that anyone with a bit of critical sense could have been able to see the good things that B/W was doing in terms of plot and characterization especially in the context of Pok√©mon, and this is not something that can be considered subjective.   
Then about the region, yeah the cities are disposed in a line but the routes themselves are complex and itricate so I don't really see the problem here. Also the region was anything but uninspired, every city was truly unique and memorable being for the weather, the buildings, the music or the biome in wich they were situated. I feel like this is another very dumb critique considering that past games had cities that were more similar beetwen one another and with identical gym buildings unlike gen 5.   


So after this and many other thoughts that passed through my mind I was left even more spechless by how much these games were hated.   
Basically I still cannot believe that the Pok√©mon game that tried and succeded in many areas more than any other Pok√©mon game before was destroyed by the fans because of nostalgia and vague and unfair critiques. The battlefield in wich Gen 5 landed was so unfair that even X and Y were considered better even though they had a ridiculous plot, wasted characters, terrible dialogues and a huge amount of nostalgia bait.   


Ok sorry for the rant but I needed it, because I know I won't get any other Pok√©mon game like Black and White anytime soon, but I hope you enjoyed my response :).
Hey man, I think gen 5 is cool. Excadrill is in my top 10 all time. I just think had they had a more inclusive dex from the jump the games general reception would've been less negative.
    Yes, and White was my first Pok√©mon game, and so far my favorite. Besides the dex thing, I think a lot of people didn‚Äôt like some of the designs. But to be fair, if you‚Äôre making a pokemon based on trash and you made Trubbish you are a really good artist. I mean, seriously it looks kinda cute?
        I dont dig some of the designs (Allomomola, swanna to name a few) but some of them are absolute bangers (the aforementioned excadrill, Scrafty, Volcorona, etc.)
        My first game was Platinum, White 2nd. I preferred platinum at the time because it was 1st of course. Looking back my favorite generation is 6 by a wide margin, with 7th in last.
I just want to add that transferring and trading Pokemon in game can be done. Sure you need at least one copy that is post game but there's nothing stopping you from playing most of the game with pokemon from other regions.
Itd be interesting to go through and do versus. I think Chansey kills audino, but Gigalith beats golem, just to name a few.
    True. Although I personally like Audino better *solely* for the fact that it‚Äôs the easiest way to level up in BW/2. But to name a few others, I think Hitmonlee and Hitmonchan beat Sawk and Throh, but Bouffalant beats Tauros, while Rapidash and Zebstrika are about equal.
        I give the edge to Zebstrika, unless were talking Galar form. Crobat kicks Swoobats ass pretty handily.
            Does Crobat technically count as a gen 1 pokemon? If we are then yeah, Crobat wins that easy. I‚Äôd say Seismitoad beats Poliwrath (and Politoed if we‚Äôre counting future evolutions) pretty easily.
                Politoad has that Drizzle, so i think its push. I'll give Seis the rub on Poliwrath though.
                    I guess you‚Äôve got a point with that. For Tentacruel and Jellicent, I think Tentacruel edges out Jellicent by just a bit.
                        I like pink jelly more than the blue one, but neither makes my top 100 lol. Meinshau reminds me a lot of medicham for some reason, but like, better lol.
                            True, Mienshao is pretty cool, and I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a single person who would rank Tentacruel or Jellicent as one of their favorite Pok√©mon üòÇ. But anyways, the next lineup I can think of is Hypno and Musharna, and it might just be me, but I think Musharna is an easy win.
That sounds like an endless wormhole that might not be the best place to go, but that aside N as a dad would be kind of cool to see.
I no longer want b&w 3 anymore
    I want pokemon z. And be able to go to galar from there.
        we have Pok√©mon "z" now lol
            And NO ONE had that on their bingo card XDXDXD
            Oh yeah, everyone talked how we must get pokemon z since galar would be next to kalos lol. 

And even though people recognised paldea could be next to kalos, no one even joked about z XDXD
    Honestly, me either. But we NEED to see that original Dragon.
Actually that‚Äôs just Ghetsis‚Äôs last name, his full name is Ghetsis Harmonia Gropius.

    I give the edge to Zebstrika, unless were talking Galar form. Crobat kicks Swoobats ass pretty handily.
        Does Crobat technically count as a gen 1 pokemon? If we are then yeah, Crobat wins that easy. I‚Äôd say Seismitoad beats Poliwrath (and Politoed if we‚Äôre counting future evolutions) pretty easily.
            Politoad has that Drizzle, so i think its push. I'll give Seis the rub on Poliwrath though.
                I guess you‚Äôve got a point with that. For Tentacruel and Jellicent, I think Tentacruel edges out Jellicent by just a bit.
                    I like pink jelly more than the blue one, but neither makes my top 100 lol. Meinshau reminds me a lot of medicham for some reason, but like, better lol.
                        True, Mienshao is pretty cool, and I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a single person who would rank Tentacruel or Jellicent as one of their favorite Pok√©mon üòÇ. But anyways, the next lineup I can think of is Hypno and Musharna, and it might just be me, but I think Musharna is an easy win.
