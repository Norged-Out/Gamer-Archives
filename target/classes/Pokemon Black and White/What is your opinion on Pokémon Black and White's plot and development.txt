[[What is your opinion on Pokémon Black and White's plot and development]]


Over the years, Black and White are considered to have the best plot and character development compared to other Pokémon games, with N being one of the most beloved characters. I haven't played them personally, but what do you think of them? As well as the resolution of certain plot points in Black 2 and White 2?


For me:  
BW-N is really a good character and I like how he is a rival. He isn't a jerk, but more a guy debating your ideas. This make the more enganging in my opinion because is break the base of Pokémon and that moments when you have the final battle is really awesome. Also enjoy theories about him (Like him being a Zoroark)  and how pure he is seen.  
Besides that, I think could be better.  
Team Plasma could be more nuance like they are in BW2. Like yeah some are bad guys but others are beliving in that mentality, thinking about the Pokemon themselves. Other thing I think that the people belive in them like "Oh no, we are so wrong!" but I don't think that was that effective.  
Also I think the game would be benefict with a Silver like guy or case of agressive towards Pokémon. Maybe whips that were cut in RB could make this more powerful.  
Besides that, is decent. Is really cool that the Gym leaders participe more and also that each rival has their develepoment, but I still don't care that much in Bianca and Cheren as I wish I could.  
BW2 Not that amazing sadly. Is Jotho again yay! Is just don't have that engaging like the BW besides I enjoyed what they tried with Colress (his theme is sick too). Also I don't think that Hugh is that a rival, he is more like a friend. I think to his fear of being weak could be played a little better because I kinda find boring is problem with the Purloin.
Its between Pokemon BW and B2W2 and Pokemon SV for the best story line. Both of them have REALLY good story lines, but SV has multiple good small story lines while BW and B2W2 has one good big story line that flows through both games.

I wish black and white 1 dropped Ghetsis entirely since it felt like with him being the ultimate villain seems like it sorta undermines the theme of there can be sides to all stories which is why N is canonically compatible with Zekrom and Reshiram and having Ghetsis trick N and have everything be for an evil cause just seems off from the rest of the game where it could be the same as base game just have N be a misguided and maybe have team plasma's deeds in the first game maybe alittle toned down. But Ghetsis being the ultimate evil and having tricked N entirely makes it feel off to me.
Not great, but good for Pokémon standards.

They still fall flat at some points, like being able to see BW1's twist from miles away (and that it completely invalidates the whole matter at hand), or that BW2 returns to the mistake of disconnecting the story from the player's goal to become Champion... but hey, it's not like the story is an attractive point to play Pokémon games... or games in general.
I really don't like N. I feel like for a character who's able to talk to pokemon he's somehow incredibly ignorant of how being stolen from their trainers actually affects pokemon. I also really just don't gel with supposedly sympathetic characters with extreme world-views like that (so fixated on one thing that they ignore reality)
    A problem with the games themselves is they aren’t representative of characters as they stand in overall continuity. 

N doesn’t really steal Pokémon, he genuinely liberates them, Pokemon choose to leave and be with him, they’re autonomous. It’s expressed better in the manga
        That would be fine but with how tied in with team plasma and their storyline he is in the games it causes him to read as supportive of their actions, even though they go against his own stated goals. It makes his character read as quite confused conceptually in the game

The manga isn't really a good defence for that as a vanishingly small portion of the people who've played the games will ever have interacted with it
I don't understand why people think BW BW2 has a good story.  It has high potential and raises some good moral questions but it dropped that ball real quick.  At least BW2 gave up that plot line it was not prepared to address and went with a solid revenge plot through your rival.

Can you please elaborate please?

BW2 states that pokeballs mind control Pokemon but does nothing with that fact.
The story really stood out. One of the things that I really liked about BW was how the other box legendary does appear and plays a part in the story. This formula should have been kept for XY and ORAS where the other legendary does appear and is caught by the rival. USUM and SwSh do have the other box legendary appearing but their roles are not like Reshiram and Zekrom in BW.
I like the idea they tried to explore but they wasted a lot of potential. N being the "chosen one" to lure in Zekrom/Reshiram and everything about Ghetsis is great but it got soured by nonsense like the team plasma members kicking around the Munna. The concept of whether its moral to own Pokemon was cool but it barely got explored other than when you meet Ghetsis giving his speech super early in the game.
