[[Pokemon Black 2 vs White 2]]


Just wondering what the key differences are. This is my first Pokemon game in a long time and I want to be sure I choose the right one. Leaning towards black, just because.

I'm sure it has been discussed before. Thanks for the help though.

Well, there's not TOO much as usual between the games

*	W2 gets Reshiram, B2 gets Zekrom

* version exclusives

* Black City or White Forest in B2 and W2 respectively. I find Black City MUCH better, though this isnt much a difference because you can receive keys from B2 owners if you have W2 and change to Black City in your W2

* In the desert route, W2 gets a dream world ability Braviary, B2 gets a dream world ability Mandibuzz on Monday and Thursday respectively

* I don't remember which but one gets a Blue dream world Jellicent and the other gets a Pink dream world Jellicent on Monday and Thursday respectively

* Reversal Mountain, W2 would be full of magma/lava and B2 would get water

* Both games get a Registeel, but W2 will get the Regice key and B2 will get the Regirock key, which isnt truly an exclusive as you can receive a key from a friend of the other version

* W2 gets an easy mode key after beating the Elite 4 and B2 gets a challenge mode key after Elite 4 but again be received from a friend of the other versions

I probably missed some but other redditors would point that out I guess :D 

    Oh, is that all? Lol

I ended picking up B2. Now I'm wondering if I have to play B1 first.

Man, I never knew different Pokemon showed up on different days. Does time of day matter?
        Nope, morning, afternoon, night, doesn't matter! Just it has to be Monday or Thursday on your DS and that's all it matters. Be careful, though because utilities like Join Avenue won't be available if you changed the time since the past 24 hours or if you used the game on another DS because they "pick up" that you move the clock to manipulate it and reset its things of the day, so yeah! 

As for BW, you're not missing out too much- of course if you played BW before BW2, the BW2 DOES seem a bit more "enhanced" so to say, but you're not really missing much. I say that BW2 can be played without BW but BW wasn't the best game, had quite some flaws and was boring post-Elite4, so if you're tight on money, or time, or anything, I'd just recommend to play BW2. 

The only real thing you miss out from BW2 if you didn't play BW before is the memory link which will activate things like past memories of Gym Leaders or certain people that you never got to see in BW and referring to your name from BW instead of "the hero"

Yeaaah, hope this helps! :D
            Hi, could you tell me if it's OK to jump from Black version to White 2, or should I get Black 2 storywise?
                Damn, this is a 10 year old comment, but I could probably still help you with this.

Definitely okay to jump from B/W to the opposite colour for the sequel. Story-wise, they're both the same asides from some minor details, and obviously whichever Legendary you prefer. I liked Zekrom better so I went with White first, then Black 2 when it was released (as well as the fact it offered the Challenge mode key).

Asides from the Legendary and version-exclusive Pokemon, you can't go wrong with either one regardless of which version of the first one you went with.
                    Thank you very much dear user <3
