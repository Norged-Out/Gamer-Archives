[[Sonic generations remaster]]


So apparently there are news going around the internet that sonic generations is getting an remaster and said remaster would be showcased on the nearest sony state of play… sooooo how do we feel bout that? I personally am quite interested in how this is gonna turn out


I love Generations but It’s incredibly accessible. Colors was exclusive to a single standard definition system for a decade so that seemed like a more appropriate re-release. This seems a bit unnecessary. That said, it’s a fantastic game and the more people who have a chance to play it, the better. I guess I’d just need more to be properly excited, like extra levels based on zones that came out after the game did in 2011.
    True. Id love lost world based level. Or even frontiers based one on that matter.
        But who's porting it if it's blind squirrel NO THANKS after what happened with ultimate I can't trust Sega
            You mean you cant trust blind squirrel
                Well wasn't it segas decision to make them the porting team???
                    I mean yeah? But how would they know blind squirrel would fuck up this badly

                            Huh
                                Blind squirrel handled that port for the switch
                                    Oh
It's weird to go with Generations. Not only is that easily accessible (unlike Colours was), it's also a title meant to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the franchise, so it exists entirely in nostalgia, but to someone playing it today would wonder why it misses out on levels based on games since. 

You'd think they're go for something like Unleashed, which hasn't been seen on consoles since the third gen, or the storybook series, though I suspect those titles are probably dismissed largely due to negative reaction to their original release from critics and casual audiences.
    I agree that unleashed should get that treatment first but who knows. Maybe its gonna get many new levels that werent in the og
    I worry there's a chance that games from the 4Kids era might be caught up in some strange legal red-tape, at least in English regions, since we haven't seen any games featuring that cast re-released or remastered since. It's possible they signed a different contract than what the previous and current casts had, since the only re-releases have been from before Shadow the Hedgehog, and after The Black Knight.

With Unleashed, at the very least, there's been some sort of copyright situation preventing the vocal theme from going up on streaming platforms, aside from various cover versions. Jaret Reddick, who wrote the lyrics and sang on it, has said over on instagram or tiktok that it seems to be an issue overseas and he's considered re-recording it himself so people can stream it
        They could always put some budget in it to have the voice acting redone, it's not like Unleashed has that much voiced dialogue.  

They're doing it with Persona 3, they can afford to do it with Sonic.
        Oh
    What game after colors had levels worth remastering?
        Counterpoint, why did a game as bad as '06 deserve to have a level remastered?
            06 had good level themes whether or not you like the game. Sonic forces had absolutely nothing worth remembering, half the levels were green hill and chemical plant
                There's still other themes. The war torn suburbs, the high tech Eggman city, and the casino jungle.
                    true, I wouldn’t mind a Kronos island level lol but that’s about it from the newer games
                        Not even a Studiopolis/Press Garden?
                            I like press garden act 2 but idk, I’d rather have a sonic CD level like a full stardust speedway level or quartz quadrant
                                Personally I would pick Wacky Workbench, but that's just because I'd be curious to what could be done with the level outside of the context of CD where it exists to intentionally slow you down.
                                    imagine the modern sonic stage, bouncing uncontrollably in 3D would be crazy lol
    Worth noting, the original leak never mentioned it'll be a remaster. The leaker also might've hinted at Shadow being involved in the game's premise, so it could be something new-ish.
I'm excited and happy to get Generations on Switch. (I know this is a Playstation direct but theres no way Sega's not getting this on Nintendo platforms.) I'd be fine with just a straight remaster but it would be cool to get some new levels as well. Or probably just the casino night pinball table. After Colors, I'm keeping my expectations in check. 

I know everyone wants Unleashed but I honestly don't think that game will ever get a remaster. It was only really received well by the fanbase in recent years, partly since it's the last mainline Sonic game to have a really big budget behind it.
    True
Worth noting, the leak never mentioned this was gonna be a remaster. That's something that snowballed from some people making that conclusion and other people seeing THAT and assuming the original leak made this claim.


The leaker speaks in riddles, in which his hints involve taking an announced game's title and jumbling it into a sentence. For this case, he said "Sonic will live in the shadow of his generation." Not only does this not mention anything about remasters/ultimate editions, it says "Shadow", so this could imply new content of some time. Be that through a re-release or a new game that's somehow tied to Generations, we don't know.


That being said, a remaster is still a possibility, though I don't know how much they could realistically change considering Generations arguably looks more polished than any Sonic game that has come since, so... I don't think this is the right time for a visual upgrade. Generations is already on Steam and Xbox anyways so like, it's not like other older Sonic games where being available nowadays is a concern. Compare that to Unleashed where only Xbox has it available, or 06 which isn't available at all nowadays.
    True
imo any of the storybook games would’ve been a better choice but ill still take generations
    Unleashed* storybooks games would need a remake
Its neat but really bleh considering we still have Heroes, the Adventure games, the Rush Games, the Advance games, and even Unleashed in much more dire need for being redone on modern consoles in some capacity
    unleashed yes rush games and advance games yes. But adventure-shadow needs a straight up remake
My guess is their going to add new stages based on Windy Hill, Metropolitan Highway,  and Eternal Highway both Classic and Modern.
    What the fuck are those last two
        I believe it’s referring to the Cyberspace city theme in Sonic Frontiers. It’s known as Eternal highway in Japan.
            What bout metropolitan highway? Forces?
                Yes Metropolis was a stage theme from Forces not to be confused with Metropolis from Sonic 2 tho 
                    And also metropolis from
Sonic heroes
I have the original on pc still looks amazing and has 4k support I don't know why we need a remaster
    Uhh i guess ps5 and switch?
        Still don't need a remaster a simple port would be enough
            True
I’m kinda just hoping for more old zone representation. CD, Storybook Games, Shadow the Hedgehog, *maybe* some more obscure games, etc.

Those could be cool zones. Also I wanna see more Badniks in the modern style. Those are always cool imo.
    True and for real
ITS REAL
True. Id love lost world based level. Or even frontiers based one on that matter.
