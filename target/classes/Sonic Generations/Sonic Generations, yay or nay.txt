[[Sonic Generations, yay or nay]]


Got Sonic Lost World for the Wii U, and although there are some naysayers I am finding it pretty fun.  But I heard Sonic Generations is a pretty fantastic game. 

I was thinking of getting it for the 3DS.  Anyone have experience with it?  What do you think?  I've read reviews but I always prefer the opinions of fellow redditors 




I've only played Generations on the PC, so I can't speak as to the 3DS version's quality, but the game itself is fantastic. I've not really enjoyed the 3D Sonic games, but this one's well done.
    I also played it on PC. Best sonic game in many years. The series started a downward turn with the sonic adventure series. It was with that game that they kind of started to lose focus on what made the older games great. Thats not to say that sonic adventure 1 and 2 were bad games. They were pretty good, but they had a number of flaws, such as a bad camera and gimmicky gameplay portions, (Fishing, scavenger hunt, and shooting levels) that were unfortunately continued by later games. I generally stopped playing sonic games for many years because of this loss of focus on actual platforming. Generations was the first I had played in ages, and I was pleasantly surprised. Unfortunately I think Sonic Generations being good was a fluke, as from what I have heard, the recent sonic games are bad again.
        i remember i had a bootleg of SA2 for dreamcast when it came out. I remember my friend giving it to me saying he had to take some files out to make it fit on the cd. When i played it, characters would cut each other off while talking during cutscenes and i figured that was something that happened when he was trying to fit it on the disc. 

Years later my little godbrother got SA2 Battle for his gamecube and i realized it was a horrible flaw in the game itself. one that they didnt even bother to fix in the re-release. lol

point is, i wasn't turned off by anything in those adventure games. probably because i was so excited to play them and they were fun. even the fishing. I loved Heroes when i got it and i really liked all the handheld platformers. For the most part i feel like i'm just aging out of the games. The last console Sonic i played was Unleashed which had fantastic running levels (i still think they should have replaced the whole Werehog concept with Knuckles and called it S&K2) but i'm just really not that interested anymore. i applaud them for keeping it fresh and trying new mechanics with every game, but i just dont have it in me anymore.
            Sonic generations on 3ds is 2D and is 90 percent different.
                how did you even find this 8y old post
                    Idk
                    Same way I did. Google! I'm looking for opinions and info for the 3ds game.

that's also what I'm doing right now. I'm playing generations on 3ds for the first time, 5 years after having played generations on pc. It's really a whole different game, but not that bad. Some soundtracks could be better, though.
The console version is amazing and probably one of the best Sonic games in a long time. 
The 3DS version doesn't have any 3D levels and has a totally different level set so you can barely compare the two. Still, the levels are still good and it's well worth playing. 
Still, if I were you, I'd pick up the proper version on console or PC. 
    Still still still
        Hey, it's a useful word! Still, I guess I overuse it a bit. 
            Haha you're good, just made me laugh for it to be used 3 times so close together
Yay if you liked any Sonic game ever.
    Sonic 2 was the best, naturally
        you are mistaken

Sonic 3 & Knuckles is best
            Sonic O6 was pretty good.....
                Don't you mean it was pretty GREAT ^GREAT ^^GREAT
                    Trying to make a good Sonic 06 joke? It's no use, man.
                        "WHAT AM I WILLING TO PUT UP WITH TODAY? NOT FUCKIN' THIS!!!"
            Well they are ALL good, but 2 was just the definitive Sonic game for me

                    basically. the gameplay was more polished. the levels were better. the co-op play (airlifing), new areas for Knuckles back when Knuckles was a cool gameplay mechanic. Super Sonic, Super Tails, Super Knuckles, Hyper Sonic, Hyper Knuckles. The music

ugh

so good.
                        Trying to build a nice backlog of DS games too.  Sonic Collection may be on my list now

                                Really? That bad huh?
                                    Eh. If you collect Sonic games and find it for cheap, buy it. I bought a copy for $10 at Target; to me, that was worth having, just to include in the collection. I do not play it often, but I like knowing it is there.
                                Guess I will just stick to the gamecube collection
                                2nd that. the emulation is terrible. only DS gen sonic game thats worth it is Rush, imo. I haven't played Colors for DS tho.

if you're going back to GBA, Sonic Advance 2 is also fantastic.
                                    2nd Rush. It's fantastic. Cannot comment on any of the others though. 
                                I second this. Sonic Colors on DS also sucks.
            I also really liked Sonic Adventure on the Dreamcast.
You are better off with the console version of Generations.  Hell, just buy Lost World for the 3DS.  The 3DS version of Lost World is actually significantly different from the Wii U version.  
    Would you say it's better?  Although I am having fun with the Wii u version, it's becoming kind of a letdown
        I really wouldn't bother with 3DS Lost World, it's littered with badly designed, very unSonic puzzle levels that go on far too long and just aren't fun to play. Add to that broken special stages that force you to use the system's gyro controls and distinctly tacked-on Wisp power-ups that, again, you are forced to use and, again, don't work how they presumably intended. The often overlooked Advance games are definitely worth checking out if you have access to a GBA.
        Yah the 3ds version is different from the console/pc versions of Generations. Pretty fun, good toilet game as each zone takes about as much time to complete as taking a poop. Not overly engaging where you'll be playing straight through until finished but good as a distraction from time to time. If you are a fan of the sonic games even the ones that people have never played like Lost rings (still deserves more credit) give it a go otherwise if your looking for the game that'll save the series give it a miss.
        lasercloud pretty much described the 3DS version of Lost World well.  The only redeeming point of it is the ranking system (if you missed that).  But I still think it's better than 3DS Generations by a little bit.  On the other hand, the console version of Generations is excellent.
There's a demo for the 3ds version of sonic lost world that was actually pretty good.
    yeah the demo wasnt terrible. i was expecting to be frustrated but in practice, the mechanics are pretty good. definitely speedrun-able
    Yeah but I already have it for the Wii U, so :/
        Is it the exact same game as the consensus version? I'm not sure.

Edit: console
            Lol consensus version
                God dam autocorrect
                    auto cucumber
It's easily the worst 3DS game I have played, and I'm a Sonic fanboy who puts up with most Sonic games.
Seems that there are not as many levels on the 3DS version?
    Yes, that is correct. Although, the 3DS version has live vs. racing with other people online. It amazes me that all the Sonic DS games since Rush Adventure have been getting a real online mode while the console games haven't.
I played though it, levels where okay I guess but rage quit at the last boss, no intention to play or replay ever again.

Yay! if it's like really cheap.
It's good. But don't pay very much for it. It can be finished in under 3 hours. There's some replayability in some mission mode type stuff, but that's about it. The music is great too. If you can actually find someone in MP, it's a good little diversion for a few rounds too.
I also bought Lost World, and really liked it, and I decided to pick Generations up. It's pretty good, but honestly I liked Lost World more. It's definitely worth picking up though, it was on sale at Amazon recently for like $15 for the Xbox 360, not sure about the 3DS version though. 
Don't buy it for more than $12. I beat it in one sitting and is no where near it's big brother on consoles/pc.
It was fun for a little while, but I thought the level design was awful. I had a bunch of issues where enemies would spawn practically on top of me, plus ramps that kill you unless you boost through them.

Other than that, I'd say pick it up if you can find it cheap somewhere.
I absolutely LOVED the console version.  The 3DS version has significantly less polish (especially the cutscenes, which go from fully animated and voice acted, to text conversations between still character models) and no 3d levels (which makes for very little difference between modern and classic sonic levels).  I may have been spoiled by the console version, but I was thoroughly disappointed with the 3ds version.
I'm probably just going to get it for casino night zone. Got the ps3 version but I love that level and music, would love to play a modern take.

Sonic Generations for the 3DS reminds me a lot of the old Genesis games. 
Generations was really good. I got it on 360 and beat it, considering getting it on 3DS because it has Radical Highway, which is my favorite stage ever.
The console and 3DS versions are completely different. Every level is different except Green Hill Zone. The console version is fantastic, and I'd absolutely recommend it if you have a way to play it. The 3DS version is good, but not great in my opinion. The Classic Sonic physics are actually more accurate to the classic games than the console version's are, but many of the classic levels are directly copied from the original game, and most of the modern levels are lacking. If you can find it for $15 or less, I'd say go for it; despite it's shortcomings, I still had fun with it.
It's awesome on the home consoles and PC, but you can probably skip the 3DS version and not miss anything.
Forget anything that you've heard about the console version, because the 2 are nothing like each other. If you enjoy the classic, side scrolling Sonic games, then this game is most definitely for you. But if you prefer the 3D Sonic games, you probably won't enjoy this, since the 3D levels seen in the console version are completely absent. 
It's an absolute blast! There's moments where the framerate drops noticeably,but it's the best Sonic game since Sonic Colors. 
I am a really big Sonic fan excluding the games after SA2, though Colors was amazing. Sonic Generations on PC was crazy-good, and I recommend that version. I also have the 3DS version for nostalgia, but this game is not as good as the console version. It's not a bad game, but it is much, much harder, the graphics aren't as nice, and the 2D/3D level differences aren't as dramatic as they should be. 

That being said, I mostly enjoyed the 3DS version of the game. If you want a trip down memory lane and are familiar with all of the levels available in the 3DS version, then go for it. Otherwise, I would suggest the console version.

List of levels by version:
http://sonic.wikia.com/wiki/Sonic_Generations#Stages
If you can, play it on something like a home console or a PC. While the 3DS version isn't bad, the console versions are much better. 
I loved the console Generations. That said, Generations 3DS is piss poor in comparison, sadly. 
I really enjoyed the xbox 360 version, its probably the best Sonic game since Sonic & Knuckles. Personally, its my favorite Sonic game. However, I heard the 3ds version is not exactly the same, if you can get a demon definitely do that. If its basically the same as the Xbox 360 version, awesome game.
Sonic has sucked ever since it became 3d, the last good one I played was the gameboy advance version
Yay, it may have different levels and plot (Same but only Sonic and Tails are kidnapped by the Time Eater, Sonic's other friends are nowhere to be seen on 3DS), but at least there's a New Soundtrack... And also: Special Stages EXCLUSIVE to 3DS

Got it 2 nights ago as the eShop will stop accepting Credit/Debit Cards next Monday (May 23rd 2022), Gotta go Fast

    Same way I did. Google! I'm looking for opinions and info for the 3ds game.
        >urprised. Unfortunately I think Sonic Generations being good was a fluke, as from what I have heard, the recent sonic g

that's also what I'm doing right now. I'm playing generations on 3ds for the first time, 5 years after having played generations on pc. It's really a whole different game, but not that bad. Some soundtracks could be better, though.
Don't you mean it was pretty GREAT ^GREAT ^^GREAT
    Trying to make a good Sonic 06 joke? It's no use, man.

    basically. the gameplay was more polished. the levels were better. the co-op play (airlifing), new areas for Knuckles back when Knuckles was a cool gameplay mechanic. Super Sonic, Super Tails, Super Knuckles, Hyper Sonic, Hyper Knuckles. The music

ugh

so good.
        Trying to build a nice backlog of DS games too.  Sonic Collection may be on my list now

                Really? That bad huh?
                    Eh. If you collect Sonic games and find it for cheap, buy it. I bought a copy for $10 at Target; to me, that was worth having, just to include in the collection. I do not play it often, but I like knowing it is there.
                Guess I will just stick to the gamecube collection
                2nd that. the emulation is terrible. only DS gen sonic game thats worth it is Rush, imo. I haven't played Colors for DS tho.

if you're going back to GBA, Sonic Advance 2 is also fantastic.
                    2nd Rush. It's fantastic. Cannot comment on any of the others though. 
                I second this. Sonic Colors on DS also sucks.
