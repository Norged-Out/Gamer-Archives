    Same, bro, same
    to this day, can only see a statue of him
Zinnervale, i am looking at you 🙄
    Everyone on Zinnervale: Wait, our server is named after *this* guy?
I’m looking forward to meeting Zosma, provider of Zosmaballs
    I love how us Zosmites all aligned to the same ~~joke~~ creed.
        This is the way.
        I love how salty some people get when there is a zosmaballs spam in chat
            what is a zosmaballs? i want to get spoiled
    He better be the final boss. It would be so cool
    >Zosmaballs

I wander if the creator of Lost Ark likes Rick and Morty.
    Zosma balls check
    You dropped this king (hands a pillow of balls)
[deleted]
    My favorite part of the game so far!
        Hes my favorite pokemon!
Where Ladon?
    Yoo anyone looking to do 2nd t3 abyss on here?
Valtan, and he dead right after his first appearance.
    Don't worry, he'll be back.
    Zing on my valtan brethren
        Did someone say KFC?
Shandi is some real Yoda mofo lol
Very true. I'm glad I'm on Sasha. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
    Me too. Be my friend!
    I'm on Vykas myself ( ಠ ͜ʖಠ)
        Nice >:D
This is how I found out kharmine was the demon we kept meeting. I just ggggg my way through and never knew lol
    That is how I found out that [Azena is my queen now](https://i.imgur.com/gGeKVcW.png) and I picked the perfect server.
        Funny meme but I haven't liked sylvanas in a long time :( such a shame what a mess they made with such a good character
            Playing classic and seeing her in undercity again... bittersweet.
*Cries in Zinnervale*
    Q so long you will never meet him
So I can meet the great allfather, Zosma Balls???
This one worked kinda fast for me: Beatrice 🤣
Brelzhaza is bae
    Hell yeah (get it?) 😎
Mine is named after an Ark😎
    Asta?
        Yes
        From black clover you mean?
            That's all I think of too
                Same
I'm still wondering who or what "Karta" is
    The ark of loyalty
        Won't lie kinda disappointed it's not an npc. 

But ay ...  this is ..... KARTA!
    Yeah it's an ark, in the same card group with the others!
Seeing Mari in game was a bit disappointing.
    That’s Dr Mari to you
    Mari is kinda adorable.

>!That Mech though!< Is hot
        Yeah, getting rid of her was a relief. I mourned for the mech tho
Did you guys meet gold river in game I was surprised it was a character.
I’m still waiting on Danube
    Gang
    Our wildly homophobic server lol
        Wait what? I haven’t seen any of this! I’ve only seen a few people popping off about Spanish in area chat, and they were swiftly told to stfu lol
            Idk I could just be at similar progression points to the same people in area chat but Everytime I check chat it’s some conversation of the like. Happy to hear it’s not rampant across the entire server lol
                Yes hopefully it’s just your bad luck because that’s a big yikes from me 🤦🏼‍♀️
                    I’m sure they’ll be banned soon enough anyways
She's the very first NPC I met
Neria players are now the spider man meme
Can only imagine that's what they do on Mokoko for each seed 😅
Dommy mommy azena
Who/What is Aldebaran?
    He's the only other (living) character who you find out was summoned like you were

&#x200B;

oh wait wrong thing
        I get it, fellow sufferer
Seeing Wei and realizing that husbando isn't available through rapport ... My heart aches 🥺
I've yet to meet Sirius
    [deleted]
        Maybe depends on the class? I've never heard of him.
            Yeah, every class has a unique intro.
    Yo zana left cause we killed him Sadge.
        Your lives are meaningless!
        I like the reference haha
    Oh shit is Sirius a character? I named our guild Sirius because of the star and didn't know there was one in game
        He's like a diety of shushire
        That's a really bright name
            The brightest!
Avesta???
    It's a group of half demon vigilantes you meet in the 960 area
        But I'm an Avesta? Damn, it is what it is I guess.
            The Avesta is the group of Delain's who all banded together to from an alliance called Avesta to fight the darkness in Feiton.

They have a very ninja like appearance and feel, and operate in the shadows against some power hungry priests who are going about getting rid of the darkness in Feiton the wrong way.

The Avesta leader is an absolute badass though. Stands toe to toe with a powerful Delain, and also a very very powerful demon. Avoiding names for spoilers.

Very happy to be on Avesta server. And Feiton has been my favorite region so far.
Lol me laughing at Valtan and Zinnervale servers how embarrassing can you imagine
Mokoko
Haven't met regulus
    I mean you can't really meet him.
Nineveh (Sadge)
I still haven’t heard of Antares other than the server name
lol, i dont want to meet Kazeros anytime soon
That's him!!!!... and he's gone
My server name is Gineah, I see it everywhere
I finished Feiton and still haven't seen Kadan. I don't pay much attention to the story, did I miss him?
    You will meet him in Easterr, the island right below Sth Vern
Currently waiting to meet Procyon 👀
    1 year later, all they show of him is him in a bird form
I have yet to meet Kharmine.

Anyone know where is Kharmine Falcone located?
    > I have yet to meet Kharmine.

That's what you think.
Azena, booba
Yeah Mariiiii
Zosma balls
I picked Sasha cause I thought it was named after S1mple
I just found Neria lol
    Aren’t there like a bunch of Nerias? Maybe I’m misremembering but I distinctly remember going into the rapport window and seeing multiple Nerias from different regions. I’m a filthy G spammer so I may have missed something that told me they’re all the same person.
        Many Inn owners are called Neria and they're not the same person. It seems to be a tradition based on a historical "Neria" who ran a famous Inn. Their real names aren't Neria, it's a pseudonym. If I recall correctly, it's mentioned in a quest for the first Neria in Prideholme.
            Yeah the Nerias are just the Nurse Joys of this universe.
            Yes the "Neria" in Prideholme tells you her real name is Canna.
                Ssh it was a secret!
            She even tells you her real name in that quest.
Moonkeep. Though before I changed regions, Beatrice.
OHHH That's Shandi
Mfw I fight akkan
where zosma

&#x200B;

\[balls\]
Still haven't seen or heard of an 'Adrinne' yet.
Happy I'm on Thirain (well, aside from than the queues and lag...) - great character!
what movie is this from lmao
    [deleted]
        real
            It's Once Upon A Time in Hollywood.
Hard to do when your server is named after a god
Is Una in game somewhere?
    Babe?

(Daily task are called Una’s task)
        Add me babe, lfg lullaby island.

(I know they are but who is Una and why are we doing their tasks?)
I was a little sad when i learned that Mari was some ugly loli.
    The mech is hot though

Also she kinda the lord of deals here
Literally took a screen shot of azena lmfao
[deleted]
    Shame on you
I know about una's tasks but I've yet to meet una
Yet to find zinger box in game
    Zing on brother
Cries on EUC Slen
Well who is Slen and where can I find them...?
Bruh im in UNA and i havent done a single task
Met Valtan
    You mean zinger?
        Not again
Mine is Asta. But what is funnier there is a place in the game which is super similar to my real name.

Will i even meet Thaemine xd
Anyone know who Una and Avesta are?
    During the assassin intro, it mentions “We are the Avesta” and someone up above commented they are half demon vigilantes. So that checks out.
Haven’t met a Ladon yet, anyone else?
Kharmine is a real interesting guy lol
Danube gang
Still waiting to meet Vern
    Isn't Vern a place?
Any idea who' Moonkeep?
Lucky mofos in Azena…
Yeah….. kharmine. Lol
Still waiting for una :/
Yeah I didn't know >!mari !<was evil. >!Also didn't we kill her? I keep seeing mari rapport stuff.!<
    She literally the discount shop patron.
        I know that, I meant in the actual story sorry.

Also my understanding is that she worked for the bad guy in stern and we kill her?
            She is not dead since she has to run shop for you. Look for island of isolated eternity :)
Oh Kazeros...
YES. Yesterday I met Zinnervale
SASHA!
Yeah I do her tasks every day. Whether I want to or not. Cuz I have a crippling addiction. Yeah.
Rohendel
The moment Zosma comes out he will be cherished like a king in global
Wei is daddy, me likey
agonizing grey cow absurd unwritten close reminiscent threatening ghost abundant

The hell is enviska
    The soul you got infused with at the beginning of the story... Very strong Sylvain who prevented the last great catastrophe
Yeah, I'm on Mokoko.
Who was Kadan again?
is there an NPC named Aldebaran?
    I think he's a Guardian but I might be wrong, can't check right now
Literally the start !! Beatrice you lil ark stealer
Mw meeting all Nerias
Me meeting all Nerias
i duno why but this literally triggered a scene in my head from Friends "some girl ate Monica!"
So... what's Moonkeep?
There are two Neria's lol
Me just sat here on Neria and I've met like 5 of them.
Playing on Rethramis, have yet to figure out how to get out of the starting continent.
I dont even know who my server is named after, babe.
Avesta Gang!!! WE ARE THE NIGHT!!!
Will take a while for us to get to see Kazeros
Go Shandi
Sasha. Bae
all you guys gangsta till you come to Beatrice
Mokoko!
i guess whenever I meet Kazeros my expression will be a lot different lol
Who is slen?
Vykas 😳
May his thighs forever reign
Mokoko is the best name for a server.
I dont think I'll ever meet my server's NPC, the literal god of the planet, Regulus
I chose the Server Asta because of the Black Clover character tbh
Umm elzowin?
Bruh waifu Innana
Looking for comments about procyon; it seems i missed sth or is he sth like the water god, with parts of the sea named after him?
I live for Mokoko server. Such a funny bunch of plebs <3
Brelshaza native here.


I honestly wasnt really happy to meet her nor deal with her, and I am not even in t2 yet let alone at her legion raid.

HELP
