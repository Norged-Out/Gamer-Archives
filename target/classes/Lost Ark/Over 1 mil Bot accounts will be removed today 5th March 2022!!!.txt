I hope they spare the two bots just chatting it up on lonely island. They're just two friends hanging out.
    true roleplay: 2 bots with GPT3 talking to each other in facility 301-x
        Role play bots would be a service to the community, it‚Äôs like open source canon and NPCs!

Wish I could make a couple bots running around identifying animals and talking out loud like they are a couple of biologists. You can make anything!

I would like to imagine the world of lost ark has zoos
            That just gave me an idea of an MMO where all the NPCs are actually just employees of the game company roleplaying.
                Thats just the real world with extra steps.
                    But *Inside* your own home!
                You want a Disneyland MMO?
                Something like that has been announced, check out "War of Dragnorox". Personally, I don't think this game is going anywhere though.
            A very long time ago in maple story, there was a short lived bot in the free market lobby that was reading out the Bible or something, on a very visible platform that couldn't be reached by legit means at the time. If you dropped mesos on the ground, it would vacuum loot it, pause and say thank you for the donation, then resume where it left off. I really didn't know what to make of it lol. I can probably still count on one hand how many times I've seen non malicious hacking since then.
                Flashback to college days when there was always somebody evangelizing in a prominent speaker's circle...
Very clever.
    "These bots were not found to be in violation of the terms of service, and enriched the culture of the lonely island experience. We find them not guilty."

*And that, little Timmy, is the story of how bots took their first step towards getting rights, and the eventual enslavement of mankind.*
    I would love to see a picture of this!
        Ol' Garv & Teri.

Usually Garv will spark up the convo and Teri will have a nice follow-up but I think Teri was camera shy.
            Did you take this picture with a ü•î?
    wai wat
Glad to see my reports are doing something. I‚Äôve pushed 3 chars to 50 and the beginning zone are filled with botters and hackers. It‚Äôs like a mini game to report them before they fly off my screen.
    They fckin whisper you at this point if you dare to write in general... I'm smashing that report butt like a mad man.
        I swear im like the only one who has not gotten a whisper at all and im relatively active in area chat. I also usually report and block all the spammers before i start talking though cause then i cant even see whats going on in chat til they're gone
            Bruh you don‚Äôt even have to be talking in chat at this point. I was afk for like 2 mins docked at an island and I got a whisper. Later on, I see the spam text in area chat, and the text bubble is from the boat next to me (different bot). They‚Äôre getting more advanced
                i was eating at benihanas and the chef whispered in my ear if i wanted to buy 1k gold for 80 cents
                sometimes they spam as soon as you join the area, they might have some tools to know all the players in the area and spam them all
            I think its if you mention gold. I take on area chat and the first time I talked about gold I was whispered
            There should be a chat filter which let's you block certain words. In WoW there is an addon for this.
            Same LOL I'm like wtf even is whispering but also I'm thankful I've not been whisper spammed to
        Smash that butt, bro!
        I thought it was so funny when I got 4 paragraphs in a row in a pm. I feel like it was a drive-by too I dont even talk in area
            Maybe it's the emotes you do for quests they use to start the whisper
        you dont even need to write mate i was passing by and suddenly got 3whisper spams without even writing anything
        When I logged in to do chaos dungies I got whispered by one no longer than 2 minutes after I was in game without using chat, it‚Äôs wild on the server I‚Äôm on
            Procyon is nuts too, like 20 bots all the same clothes. Same gddgdgdsss names etc flying fast asf round, faster than my mount haha
    Yep every time I teleport I spend a minute reporting it seems. Doing my part.
        Same here, [I'm doing my part!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_7FaWnlhS4)
    Started leveling my 5th character(previous 2 alts boosted and 1 knowledge transfer) yesterday and it's just depressing. I see couple different bots per minute, 100s per hour and it's just one channel on one server. Makes me wonder how much of current online population is actually bots because I would wager it's quite a sizeable %.  

If it was my first character I would straight up quit when 99% of characters you see are bots. They really need to get better anti cheat.
    üòÜ mini game with no reward, I have been investigating and reporting the URLs, DNS and subdomains.
    Why would you level 3 when you have power pass and knowledge transfer?
        Maybe they used them already? So 3 chars after powerpass?
            Well, there's knowledge transfers as well still.
                i like leveling, its chill mindless gaming when i just wanna relax.
                    I normally do to, but it's just too much click/G spam for me, with mediocre quests, a not very interesting storyline that's got a mediocre translation (Why are there so many inconsistencies in how something is translated? Why do subtitles not match the voice acting? And it seemingly only gets worse the further in I go. Can definitely tell it was translated by a group of people that did not communicate with each other very much. But enough of me ranting about the translation quality).

The main saving grace is the dungeons, and a few points in the story (namely the sieges), which is a shame, as this is otherwise a very good game.

So yeah, given the choice, I'd definitely choose skip as much as humanly possible every time myself.

Anyway, sorry for this way too long reply to just a simple message about how you enjoy leveling. Guess I just needed to get this off my chest. I love this game, but oh boy is the story a chore to get through.
                        If you pay attention you can see changes and improvements every play-through. As far the subtitles go they are often more up-to-date and accurate than the voice lines so hopefully they rerecord those later.

Localization work is actually hard and tedious. It is also all done blind so not every translator is aware of what everyone else is doing and this is no doubt made much worse by the lack of in-office interactions. Also the toolset is often really clunky which makes iteration slow.

As long as they continue to clean things up each maintenance it will get better fairly quickly.
                Also I know lots of ppl are sick of the storylines but I just love it. Still working on my main and powerpassed two alts but I can't wait to redo the story. I can't get enough
                    I bought a new switch and cap for the G key, so now I can level at least two more chars before I need more replacement parts
                    I don't find the story that good to be honest, I don't want to waste like 20 hours doing the story again. But each person with their own things.
                        I mean honestly its nice that they even provide an avenue at all to fast track  alternate characters for free. Most games would just have you level from scratch again or pay money to fast track through the story
                            This game has to be the most respectful game out right now. They understand convenience doesn't have to be a commodity that is bought and sold.
                    I‚Äôm glad someone likes it
                And dont you have to get to luterra to use KT?
                    Nope just need to unlock songs in prideholm
                        If you join a/your guild you can right click your name in members and tp to stronghold as soon as you start
                        Lol I did it 3 times getting all the way to luttera to unlock the ‚Äústormhold‚Äù since I thought that was what I needed to do ü§£
                            ouch

                That costs a shit ton of gold that people don't have this early unless whaling.
                    If 600 gold is a shit ton to you we are playing very different games
                        I legit got 10k in one day in T2 (granted I ran 2 legendary maps, but still)
                    ?????? 600 is a shit ton of gold? Any lvl 50 char can make at t1 as much in WAY less time than the time you waste by lvling 50 chars.

You are literally wasting progress if you don't KT with no exceptions. The time you waste to level up accounts could be used top farm multiple times this gold and/or progress


tl;dr there is no reason to manually raise an alt unless you plan on making more than 12 characters
                        I level mine manually so i can try the class. Instead of wasting my powerpass or gold in something i dont like. If i end up not liking more than 6 classes ill just repeat my main with power pass.
                            Problem is that you cant possibly know that until you reach endgame.

I was leveling soulfist and felt so fun but on actual bossing with actual skillset I just don't like her. Nothing wrong with her I'm not going to complain its just not for me

On the contrary gunslinger, I hated her early (I kt'ed her and ditched her) but I picked her up again, tested more skills and now she is much more fun both time to hunt and shotgun build (I mostly use time to hunt cause the lack of skillpoints hurt)

Its really hard to know in advance, worst case you just ditch it and keep it for daily slave. I have 8 chars right now, 2 of them are stationary at 340, they don't even do gaurdians/chaos but they login daily for the 4 bifrost points to do me some work. One day I might delete them but for now they earn their keep
                        how do you make 600 golds? currently at T1 and struggling to make even 20 gold per hour
                            Selling all the tradeable matts on tradehouse you get nets you a lot. It probably comes out to about 1/4th of your total matts so it will increase the time it takes you to tier up a bit, but those matts won't be worth nearly as much for very long.

Chaos Gates give maps and these maps usually contain the fail% honing material and sometimes leapstones, which can be sold for a decent amount. Also can get skillbooks. If you manage to bid on the legendary map then you can probably sell the spots (haven't done this personally but the maps are usually about 2-3k atm in tier 2!).

Selling adventure tome consumables has net me a lot of $$. There is a limit to how many the whales will need to complete, so the matts for those should also eventually be cheaper.

All in all its slower progression in trade for more gold, which lets you buy the crystalline aura relatively easily. IMO it's worth doing for that alone as a free to play player.
                            The "Chaos Gate" event can be done once a day per Roster, and at the end a Legendary Map is put up for bid; the 30 players involved in the Gate Event bid against each other and if you don't win it you get your share of the winning bid. I've seen a Map go for 7k Gold (>230 gold).

&#x200B;

Between this and selling unbound Stones from my T1 alts Guardian Raids (I only do them when I have the double harvest up) I would say I'm consistently making 400g a day for about an hours effort
                        > tl;dr there is no reason to manually raise an alt unless you plan on making more than 12 characters

What about grinding for the Lostwind Cliff set?
                            Remind me again, isn't that the set that drops from abyss? I don't recall any way to farm this up by 1-50 leveling
        Some people are saving the power pass for new classes that are coming out.
            With just 600 gold you can do knowledge transfer and get your character to lvl 50 with vern quest done.
            really stupid idea, though. powerpasses have a timelimit and so far all newly released classes came with a pass in the other regions
                Wait they have a time limit? I honestly had no idea well I guess I have to use my second one now
                    They don't have time limit once you claim them, you can just save them, Chech the top right corner in server select and it tells you that you have a powerpass available in your server with no time limit
                    They don‚Äôt have a time limit. They can be held for as long as you need them.
                On the login screen it shows there is not a time limit when you have one avalible.
                    then they must have removed it, i am sure my tickets on ru had them and i have seen others talk about it too when west released. nvm then
            gj for the minus IQ play, you not only have wasted gold you also slowed down your mains progeess, cuz you get a free char slot and punika boost with all the classes coming out for free and a gearing even too
        There's still some merit to learning a class by playing it through the leveling process.  Just depends on how you like to play.

Edit: why would this be downvoted?  A lot of people enjoy the leveling process, not everything has to be speed rush min/max endgame only focused
            that's true, i used powerpass and i feel so disconnected from my class abilities. reading 20 abilities that all say " does 2000 damage" and 100+ perks at once doesn't really work.Shooting them at random during chaos dungeon isn't working out either because the party overshadows you.

that said the campaign is horribly long and you rarely fight, so it truly is a bit too much for the purpose.I gladly go through the 6-8 hours super linear and fight-filled campaign in Path Of Exile everytime, but Lost Ark questing an entire continent a second time can't be digested as easily.
            if only msq wasnt sooooo long and forced , outside annika u cant skip anything afaik.

i hated leveling alts on FFXIV because was boring w/o quests or repeating msq ...but oh boy now i understand why.
                The sad thing is that you spend more time running around NOT killing monsters, I cleared all quests on my main and really wasn't feeling like this was a combat game. I don't think I can face the "plot" more than once.
            [deleted]
                So playing a class more doesn't teach you how to play a class?  I never said it was the only way to learn, but playing with the abilities as they come can show you what works well as the game progresses.

There's not really a wrong way to do it, powerpass or level.  Depends on what the player enjoys and how much time they have.
            Getting used to a powerpassed alt... I felt like I might've just leveled it up on the story lol.
            Yeah guys mobile gamers lives matter damn
        It can be fun.
        what does knnowledge transfr do?
            It‚Äôs essentially a boost. The only one that is actually worth it is the lvl 10-50 boost. You can only skip story sections past 50. So if have a tier one char I can‚Äôt boost the ilvl with it. But once I get to 600 you can use knowledge transfer to skip the story.

This process also takes 8 hours it isn‚Äôt instant. All these reasons are why the 10-50 is the only one actually worth it.
                so with that can i move my level 52 and gearscore 960 to another class if i wanna play something different?
        [deleted]
            wut? You have 9 knowledge transfers available. You level one main + 2 free power passes + 9 knowledge and you are at 12 characters already. If you are a masochist and want all classes you just need to level up 3 of them.
                You can only knowledge transfer based on how many you have done Vern with, and knowledge transferred characters don't count. So first character and 2 power passes allows you 3 knowledge transfers.
                [deleted]
                    You get 9 Vern knowledge transfers for finishing the Vern story once.
            Why would you want to make 15 classes? You have to pay real money btw to unlock more char slots.
                Because no life, what else you gonna do
                    Get to tier 3? Do endgame content? Farm gold? Explore other places? There much things to do instead of just going trough a lot of chars from 10 to 50 XD
                        Knowledge transfer them all, literally 0 need to level again
            I have 1 Artillerist, 1 Deadeye, 1 Striker, 1 Gunlancer, 1 Bard, 1 Gunslinger and 6 Paladins. I leveled all of those characters from scratch except for 5 Paladins which are Transfer Knowledge and the Gunlancer and Bard which are Powerpasses.
        because the reasons other people have said. But also the easiest way to get some card duplicates (including Solus) is to level an alt. 

Also get a chunk of heart currency which is just a plus.
    I was working on an alt.. the cathedral in Prideholme is an endless stream of Rakjjfpabalksd names. In less than 10 mins I had 30 reported and blocked.. and I missed almost half.. They're like ants.
    Same! Ive gotta be at 200+ blocked at this point.
        Block list caps at 100, unless you mean between all characters.
            I kinda wish there was no cap, same with friends list I don't understand why there is a cap. Maybe its a limitation I just have no idea about?
            Welp then I guess it's capped lolol I know I've definitely reported 200+. At one point I needed a break from doing collectibles and island and just city/channel hopped with the sole purpose of reporting for a sold hour.
        The max is 100 unfortunately. Have been manually cleaning my block list, so tedious. I guess it was worth it after all!
    How did you not turn out of energy? I can barley tradeskill for an hour before I‚Äôm buying pots to last about 30 minutes.
    Like you have just leveled them for fun? I have six 50s and could only manage that once. The story is decent, but not so good I'd want to play through it multiple times.
        Hey, I‚Äôm planning on having 12 chars end game so will need to level some to 50 for knowledge transfer. Also I enjoy playing a new class through the story just to learn spells. I don‚Äôt follow guides or the meta so I like to feel it out.
            Wanting to play through the story again is a completely valid reason to do so, but just an FYI that the Vern transfer is special and unlocks 9x by completing the story on just one character. You can get 12 L50 characters with only one manually leveled, two powerpassed, and nine knowledge transfers.
    Newbie here. I was doing a salt giant with another dude and this rando comes up and one shots 18 bars. Should I have reported him for hacks or does end game dmg really allow such a thing?
        I could do that at tier 2. It was probably me.
    How do you report them? I can't even read the names with them zooming
        click on the name in chat and you'll get the option to report/block etc.
            I mean those who teleport leveling / farming via bot and don't chat spam :(
                Oh yeah, tricker those!  I'll be logging or mining and see hundreds run by, I guess there's not an easy way to report them as they are gone so fast, and teleport on the run.  Hope today really does help.
I hope I‚Äôm safe, my main is a gunlancer, so that should flag me as not a bot, as bots lack the superior taste of picking gunlancer
    this is exactly what I would program my gunlancer bot to say‚Ä¶
    **sweats in Zerker main**
    #facts - never have I seen a group of gunlancers traipsing around
        True seems like 90% of them are zerkers though.
            And the other 10% are sorc
            Paladin underrated
            That includes the zerker I matched with in Abyssal last night, right? Right? :(
        Levelling gunlancer is fucking pain.

Did it once and since then, straight to vern pass or memory trasnfer.
        not a group, but lve seen 3 badly scripted gunlancer bots that were runing to the same points but not killing the mobs lol
            > but not killing the mobs lol

O-our damage is fine!
    I'm worried though because I mad an alt berserker. It was a moment of weakness...
    Being last person left alive in cube bomber round as Chad lancer felt amazing.
        Chadlancer should be the official name. Those guys just dont give a shit. Seeing a grabbed chadlancer grabbed by vertus taking absolutely no fucking dmg...i mean come on.
    im one of like 5 sharpshooters in existence. no way i could be banned
    Do you save a counter attack during raids at all times? I feel like every Lancer I play with hits every one but when I try they are on CD a lot.

Also can we not counter attack from the side of monsters?
        I'll hold on to dash upper fire, but use bash as the start of my rotation. You must hit them from the front for a successful counter.

Dash upper fire also has high stagger and weak point, so it will be used for those moments on bosses too.
        Yeah it‚Äôs annoying. I try to keep my counter for stuns or for breaking barriers, but I feel like they only glow blue/purple if they are facing away from me or I used it already for their stagger period.

What doesn‚Äôt help is each guardian and boss seems to have a completely different radius in front of them that you can hit.
    Cause he‚Äôs so slow xD
O god.... this is fantastic, but this sub is gonna overflow with salt from players that got flagged for afk macros and staying online for days at a time. EUC bout to lose that queue real quick.
    Get ready for all the "Amazon banned my account for no reason!!!" posts
        Automod gonna get a workout for sure.
            The sadistic part of me loves the thought of a script banning someone in Lost Ark and then another banning them on reddit for crying about it.
                Sounds like satan
        Coming for many, many, MMOs, all these "banned for no reason" posts on the internet are usually from hackers/cheaters trying to get sympathy 99% of the time. Best part about those posts are when GMs or someone from support coming in and showing all the shit they did that got them banned.

Yes, there are people who get hit by system by accident, but they usually just go through the usual route and get their account back easily.
            The good ole jmod smackdown
        This is AGS, for once I'm gonna trust the people saying they got banned for no reason.
            Yeah because people on the internet never lie.

I don't believe AGS will not mistaken ban people but at the same time I don't trust people to not lie about the reason why they get banned, too.

Lose lose situation.
                AGS will definitely mistakenly ban people. It's a given it happens with every ban wave and every autoban system. At the same time people are definately gonna lie because nobody is gonna admit they're a botter and a gold seller who spams area chat.  


I think the ban wave will do more good for the game but hopefully support can address the people who were mistakenly banned and unban them in a timely manner and hopefully the autoban is a decent bit accurate as to not ban a ton of legitimate people
                    > I think the ban wave will do more good for the game 

I haven't been back to the starting areas yet but it hasn't really lessened the gold selling spam at all.

The issue with free to play games is that it costs the gold sellers nothing to make a new account, it's the flaw in the model.

Charge $10 for the game and you lessen that quite a bit.
                I've got false ban for trade macro in a god-damn EvE just a month ago. Got 15 days Omega for free and personal email with apology from Senior GM. 

I know 10 years old youtube channel with thousands of videos and in total millions of views that got deleted, because strike bot fucked up and strike the same video three times (in row), that was manually checked as OK. This was the first time I saw a machine take the live hood of a man and get him on the bring of suicide.  Not a SINGLE person looked into it. 

It happens a lot, when everything is checked by algorithm without human inputs.

Amazon has a receipt for people being banned for no reason in their games, just by chatting or fishing. FFS, they couldn't even be bothered to prevent client input (TEXT INPUT!) fucking with other clients. Why would I give any benefit of the doubt to these lazy wankers...

It's always the righteous that screams first when they get on the bad side...
                    I'm perfectly aware that false positive bans can, will, and have happened.

But like I said, people also like to lie about reasons why they get banned, too.
            Yeah trust the whole wave of people coincidentally whining about it during bot ban waves, good call.
                I‚Äôm more likely to believe someone who claims to have been erroneously caught up in a bot ban-wave than I am to believe someone who claims to have been erroneously banned in a lone hit.
                    I'm more likely to believe it's people just not accepting consequences.  Speaking as someone that has (and still does) lost more than a couple accounts (rightfully so) in ban waves.
                Well there will be false positives, so an influx of complaints when a ban wave hits kind of makes sense
                At this point I really hope you get wrongfully banned so I can throw your post right at you and laugh.
                When you ban 1m accounts at the same time then yeah you get everyone whining at the same time.

I wouldn't be surprised if they just did something like banning everyone who got reported more than 3 times or something like that lol.
                i guess you never played NW or read about it
                If it was any other publisher.. yeah, but we talking AGS.
                If it were anyone but Amazon lol.
            Why? Amazon is good at customer service. It is employees they have a record of not treating well.
        tbh, until AG is able to provide proof or specific infos about bans, players that comlain about false bans should get the benefit of the doubt.

That is a problem AG is doing to themselfes AND people that got illegitimately banned dont even know why and wont get any answeres for that too or possibilities to fight that decison. AG plays plaintiff and judge at the same time and you as the "victim" cant do anything against this.
            Have you, brother, seen AGS support?
            > tbh, until AG is able to provide proof or specific infos about bans

That's something all games do though, not specific to Lost Ark or AGS.
            >players that comlain about false bans should get the benefit of the doubt.

Not really since this has happened A LOT in online games and it easily ends up being revealed that they did deserve the ban.
                Except most cases so far seem to imply Amazons support is incompetent. They've acknowledged that they have incorrectly banned people via the commerce ban already.

Edit: Proof of acknowledgement by them since everyone seems to be jumping to Amazons defence with 0 clue what they are talking about.

Support says it's affecting multiple people and should be fixed all at once.
                    and then they said all those bans are rmt bans and everyone i know that got banned did in fact rmt.
                        No they never, stop talking shit.

2 giant threads where roxx asked people for their names to help them out, both with dozens of people proving they didn't refund anything. She also said the team are investigating it.

https://forums.playlostark.com/t/another-permabanned-thread/229785

https://forums.playlostark.com/t/commerce-lock-ban-permanent/229396

Both of these threads have numerous examples of their support being provided with evidence of no refunds and continuing to say there was a refund, while asking for the evidence they had already been provided.

The fact that your 2 friends RMT and got banned for it is irrelevant.
                            https://forums.playlostark.com/t/banned-for-purchasing-skin-from-ah/229315/71

You are on the 3rd stage of grief.  Anger. You or your friend cheated and bought gold, the account is never coming back.  I don't believe you didn't RMT and i really don't care about what excuse you come up with next.
                                Most people that claim to be falsely banned deserve it but what about the ones that didn't? Fuck 'em for being unlucky?

False positives happen and I sincerely hope one day you'll get caught in one.
                                    The thing is they are all getting banned for refunding, when 90% are able to provide proof they didn't.

If they are being banned for RMTing that should be the reason they are banned and supplied with but it's not. Prior poster is just a dipshit.
                                I haven't been banned, your dumb fucking assumptions further proving how much of a moron you are.

Even if your theoretical situation was true and all those people were banned for RMTing why is support still saying it's for a refund? Incompetent either way but go off, idiot.

Some more proof for you dumbass -

                    They haven't acknowledged that they have incorrectly banned anyone, unless you're referring to something else than the OP.

As with every ban wave in every game there's going to be people complaining that they got unfairly banned. They are merely saying please direct those appeals to <<here>>. That doesn't mean that they knowingly falsely banned people at all
                        I linked the threads further down.

Saying you are investigating every one of these bans and names would be helpful with that implies it's abit more than just "The norm." It is not normal for Community managers to get involved in the usual CS tickets.

That's without even mentioning that 90% of people in those threads provided proof they never refunded via screenshots of their steam history. There is LITERAL PROOF provided.

They are even warning that they are going to falsely ban people in the bot wave, enough so that they announced it.

                One of the most memorable reddit threads for me.

Player Y - "I was false banned, I did nothing wrong!!!

GW2 Rep: The chat log shows you saying "You fucking f\*\*\*ots I hope you all die."

Player Z - "I was flagged for my name but it is not offensive at all"

GW2 Rep: Your name was TheHollocastWasALie

Yes I'm embellishing a little here, but it wasn't that far off.

Though to be fair there were actually one or two legit false flags. Like someone getting banned because of a report. But for the most part it was just glorious.
                ‚ÄúAll‚Äù of them? 100%?

Are you saying the dev responded to every complaint and proved each one was legit? Or is it possible that a decent number were mistakes, but you just didn‚Äôt notice that because it wasn‚Äôt as entertaining?
            [deleted]
                No gold site. Had some experiences with AGs banning-behaviour prior to launch in the forum. After 90 days of activity and 5 days reading time (approaching launch) my more critical comments got deleted without any good reason and shortly after i got my permaban. And you neither know why or are able to fight that.

Of course its easy to assume that all of those people are guilty, as long as you are not the victim, but AG also has a bad history with automated bans in New World too.
And with the last wave of complains CMs admitted that there were a good amount of false bans, what at the same time proves, that they were lying for weeks now with denying that automated bans happen without any employee in between.
That they are not providing prove is as much a problem for them, as it is for the players and Community,because nobody knows if they are valid.
                    > And you neither know why or are able to fight that.

That's how things work everywhere though.
                        >That's how things work everywhere though.

So thats fine and okay? Wouldnt care about a plattform, where i never did spend a penny (So i dont care about the forum a lot tbh), but when people got falsly banned in a game where they already spend a lot of money, it is problematic.
                            > So thats fine and okay?

Yes? Not sure what kind of answer you are looking for here.

> but when people got falsly banned in a game where they already spend a lot of money, it is problematic.

I don't think I said otherwise, when it comes to people who actually got wrongfully banned.

I just said these companies don't disclose the reason/why/where/when/how a person got banned for. That's information cheat makers can use to improve their cheats.
                                Yeah, i guess the info "banned for name XY", showing the accusations of reports or specify what their systems thought, what happened, like for RMT "got X amount of gold from bot Srdfgionuze", is something those botters will have the info from, to improve their cheats. I mean, realy? They dont need to show the code of their auto-ban-systems, but provide simple info, where people are A: able to prove if they are falsly banned or B: pay more attention on, when its just a timeban for "inappropriate behaviour" or some sort of combination of letters, that could be missinterpreted in names.

Not to mention that botters wouldnt care at all. Thats a Free2Play-game. They just make another Account and start from the beginning. Thats also why the ban-wave that got announced wont have a large impact on bots at all. But there will be false bans and i think there will be a lot of them.
            Found the botter
            It's tough because the more information AG provides, the more information botters have to work with to avoid automated bans.  Honestly I'm unsure what the correct balance is, but I do think the emphasis should be on not falsely banning legitimate players rather than on catching every bot.

RIGHT??????
                                    Except you weren't playing, you were sitting in a city doing nothing while an auto clicker kept you in the game
        So, wait, are we not allowed to be salty if our account does get banned for no reason? I paid real money for a founder pack and some extra gems on top of that. As of today, I can't log in. Never used any sort of automation. Never bought or sold gold. I've only ever played the game by sitting at my computer, clicking, and pressing 'g' and a few other keys.
    I was fishing on the left side and watching netflix on the right for 7 hours straight with 3 total breaks to make a sandwich, get more water or piss. I‚Äôm kinda worried I‚Äôll be in the ban wave lol
        new game: Fishing bot or virgin (I too can fish in mmos for 7 hours straight)
            lmao fishing mini game = good game, no fishing mini game = bad game.
        Always wait for the first banwave to see what is caught before doing any fishing scripts üëç
            I haven‚Äôt done any scripts lol, but to the game it might look like it
                it wont look like it unless you have the same delay everytime u fish or something
                    Oh yeah I guess that‚Äôs true, since the fishing timing isn‚Äôt the same every time I should be good then! Plus I failed to catch the fish sometimes during good parts of my shows lol
    100% , I myself have reported about a dozen of accounts who did that shit on Kadan EU-Central.

On one hand it really sucks that players even get the intention to do these things because servers are overpopulated. On another hand it's totally justified for all those people who had to wait longer in queue because bobby from the neighborhood didn't wanna log out.
        I was reporting g pretty heavy at the beginning but soon got tired of the clicks and typing for each one. At least in WoW I had a macro that automatically sent a report of my target but ultimately bots are the reason I left that game.
    queues existed from day 1 on my euc server even before people  started to stay afk
    Yesterday everything worked perfectly,matchmaking,entry to chaos dungeon,queue etc.I really hope they continue banning these bots and maybe think of something more strict cause they will be the ruin of this game,They already drove blue crystals prices to 800+ gold,this is insane to be happening ,the game is barely a month out.
    Queues have been better for me the last couple of days so they might already be banning them.
    They got themselves to blame, unfortunately.
    Good, fuck these macros. I know for some people it was the only solution but it's wrong. 
Even tho Amazon is to blame.

Still, everyone who used it should know that this stuff will eventually get you banned
        THIS.

Today after maintenance, EUC suddenly went from 8k queue to 1k queues for the entire rest of the day.

Instead of sitting in queue for 2 hours, people waited just 10 minutes.

It's disgusting how the queue wouldn't be a problem anymore if we didn't have so many macro abusers desperately trying to be online all day, just to play for 20 minutes in the evening.
    Why would they ever include something like that in the bot detection system? Do you really think bots are the ones being afk or that it'd even make sense to ban players for anti-afking?
i wondered what happened to queve when i logged in to my server and had only 3k queve.. it used to be 15-18k at this hours.
That's absolutely insane. 

Can't wait to not see this every time I go anywhere in the game. https://imgur.com/a/eCQTqu9

I‚Äôve made in my mission in the game: Everytime I see a bot advertising for gold selling websites to report and write a detailed explanation about which website, the price and amount of gold. 

I hope some bots were banned because we can‚Äôt let this game get ruined like many of the recent MMOs
    Please devs give me a one-click "report for gold selling" instead of making me type a gibberish message every time.
Me: sweating nervously after I spent four hours while I was working just turning to occasionally press 'g' when an item respawned so I could get a food for the adventure's tome.
Speaking of bots, how the hell are some zerker bots running faster than me on my mount?
    Speed hacking.
        I heard that they were actually teleporting and them running faster is just the game trying to make sense of it
            They're speed hacking, they're tele hacking, and they're noclip hacking.

            Editing character movespeed in RAM and bad server-side checks that don't catch it (or maybe they do but they don't instaban)
                Insta banning is bad because it just lets script programmers trial and error their hacks
                    [deleted]
                        I‚Äôm not proud of this but I developed botting scripts for another popular MMO and the most frustrating thing with the development process was trialing a new script I wrote, seeing it work for a few days, then having the account banned after a couple days. Was it the amount of time played? Hours played per day? IP address? Specific problem with the script that could be auto detected? Was I reported by a player? 

All of those questions are unknowns because it was impossible to pin down exactly what triggered the ban. And the feedback loop to improve the botting script would take multiple days just to realize it needed further updating.  If instabanning was utilized, I would‚Äôve known exactly what caused my bots to get caught, and I would ALSO have a very good understanding of how their bot detection system works. Part of the beauty of not getting instabanned is the mental game it puts on botters and bot devs. We don‚Äôt know precisely how the bot detection system works, so as a result all the ‚Äúanti-detection techniques‚Äù that we cake into our scripts is purely conjecture and rumor for how we think the bot detection system works. These smoke and mirrors effects would evaporate the second instabanning is implemented.

Hopefully this provides some insight into why instabanning is not the ultimate solution that you might (logically) assume it to be.
                        If you let botters trial and error hacks it would become much, much worse than the situation you described.

You might not be aware but your opinion on the matter is siding with and supporting the botters.

instantly banning is the worse option.
No one else finding it weird that they are announcing this ahead of the banwave? Rookie mistake.
    They've probably already flagged all the accounts they're going to ban in this wave.
    Perhaps this will spook them into trying to offload gold from bot accounts. That can then be traced to accounts not caught in the ban wave that are involved?
        200 IQ play.
        Maybe it's a perfect bait to then ban accounts that gold is offloaded to.

The real 200 iq play
    accounts are already flagged any interaction with other accounts will probably get those accounts flagged too or at least investigated.
    I‚Äôve noticed queues on my server in EUC dropping massively the last few days. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this has been underway for a while & is only just being announced.
    Due to the short timeframe bot makers wont have time to do anything meaningful anyway.
Let's see how many false positives there are. Hopefully not many.
    All the people running anti-AFK macroes are going to flood this subreddit with "false positives" ;p
I wonder how they will deal with the blatant gold buyers. You can see on this sub some posts/images of evidence this is occurring. Give these people the hammer.
    Agreed, gold buyers should also be banned. No demand == no incentive for gold sellers.
        Something misunderstood by a lot of people posting here...
            I don't think those posters are misunderstanding, I think they're the gold buyers.
                Probably.

        Less demand  = cheaper gold. Lmao
    My friend bought gold and proceeded to brag about his ilvl. Please ban him I beg you.
        Literally the top 5 in my guild went from 1300 to 1350 in like 3 days and proceeded to brag about how you can get 1k gold for 70c
            [deleted]
                They both said they would have spent almost 250$ on gold to get to where they are
            What‚Äôs sad is it‚Äôs not even hard to make gold at t3. My guild lead has 5k crystals and 125k gold. I made 13k in 3hr
    I think the problem with buyers is that it's a lot harder to prove and confirm they actually bought gold than it is to determine that an account is botting or selling. The in-game transaction won't involve any real-world money so what makes a seller account sending someone gold any different than me sending one of my friends gold?

Sure, if you can trace a bot account back to the seller account they off-load to and then trace those back to the people they send gold to chances are pretty damn good those people bought gold but how do you prove that the person actually bought the gold for real money? Should you be banned if a bot just randomly sends you 100k gold by accident and you accepted it because hell yeah, free gold?
        Ah the ‚ÄúI have no idea why I got gifted free gold from bot‚Äù defense. It‚Äôs pretty weak lol.

            People are listing them for 30-50k sometimes more. No one is buying them. You search sold items and what they sold for. The highest accessory I saw was like 25k a few days ago. Most good items were selling around 10k there was less than half a page that sold for over 10k. I am referring to useable gear (accessories) only.

        2 of my accounts been banned for gold buying. Did 100k. Though i believe it was because i bought the gold on an alt lvl 10 and sent it to myself on main to try and be sneaky and that triggered something. They both received red game ban text on steam as well. But you wont have many people like me coming forward and being honest about it. Who wants to admit they got banned for that. 
I deserve it and no excuse, just saying that they have at least started an "effort". Out of 20 people i know in a community, 4 got bans. Thats a start. They were all buyers.
            Perma ban or temp?
    Paying real money to buy royal crystals to buy gold: reddit sleeps.

Paying real money to buy gold from a third party: real shit
        honestly i view it as the same‚Ä¶. my only real interest in this article is how much this will cause the game population to go down?
    Soon all the gold sellers will realize its not worth it, gold is worth literally zero. The game throws more gold at you than you will ever possibly need at t3.
        But you can literally get anything with gold
            Silver is the cap, ive been in tatters rerolling my gems.
                I think you can convert gold to silver at an npc
                    The ratio is ghastly, 1k gold equals 100k silver. Thats 3 gem reforges @ 36k a pop.
                        reforging a gem is basically always a mistake. Just sell the one you dont want and buy the one you want.
                            There is some skills that just dont sell. Ive gotten hook chain 4 times in a row xd.
So that means a million new bot accounts will be created on the 6th?
    Unfortunately, yes. Our hope is that AGS continue to track and ban them untill they decide it's not worth it anymore.
    More like two million
    200 000 units ready with a million more well on the way.
Tbh, removing existing bot accounts wouldnt do anything. What they need is to prevent bot to level up. Once they level to 50, they just dispose accounts and create new ones since that's how they make gold from one time only challenge/rapport per account. As proof, leveling bots below lv50 are still untouched and they just keep making new accounts and leveling again...
    They need to IP block China and just be done with it.
        or bind the one time gold to the account so it can't be traded.
Hopefully they permaban 3rd party gold buyers on first offense. Too many companies are lenient and it just snowballs.
    Being completely honest here. I tried to buy gold once as I got annoyed because of gem prices being devalued and its no excuse at all.
I bought it to an alt, then sent from alt to main just in case. 
Both accounts got banned. They were not just any ban, but it also gave me red text saying game ban. Now maybe transferring the gold with same IP triggered it. But its at least good news. Right now playing clean and I'm glad i got banned tbh. Playing much more relaxed now and with friends more. Definitely not worth buying gold.
        Ss or didn't happen.
            https://imgur.com/a/FhCm9ym

I can give SS of payment for gold too lmao. Trust me they are banning slowly... Very few people will come clean about it and heck I learned my lesson and playing clean now. Much more relaxed too. Also in forum post, roxx did say a lot of the people trying to appeal for the refund bans going around, were trying to sneak in and actually got caught buying gold. They are permanently banning gold buyers lmao. But who would admit it? And plus the sellers aren't bothered if buyers banned. They get more, sell more, space it between many accounts, etc. So obviously it isn't slowing anything down. But it is true amazon is banning people. Nobody will show you this though, why would they shame themselves? Yeah some will always get through the cracks. But if my 100k one time payment got me banned and 100k barely makes a difference end game... I can imagine people buying more could be tracked fairly easily too.
                What time were you exactly banned at? Also did you buy it from a site posted in chat?
                    Didnt use a chat advertised place, but I'd assume those are riskier. It took 9 days to get banned after buying. I assume if the seller gets banned for it on a storage account, they track those who stuff was sent to. Thus i got hit. Its cat and mouse, but at least they are slowly working on it.
                        Thanks for the incite. Looks like I‚Äôll prob get hit then with a ban. If I don‚Äôt by some miracle I‚Äôll stop buying gold. GodSpeed.
                            Some will always slip through. You may be fine. But in the end it isn't worth it. In the moment it feels great. But there's people who spend $20,000 and then it devalues fast. Plus after Argos we may get t3 boosts or honing boosts. Its just...not worth it.. i regret personally. Hopefully you'll be fine, but i now stand with others in being against it. Since it devalues so quickly, the only thing its doing is raising crystal prices which hurts all.
                Cool, time to start spending 70 cents to get a "present" delivered to assholes in chat.
        Thanks for being honest.  But it begs the question, what if you share an IP with someone as in family member or roommate and you give each other free gold or gear?  Would that be auto ban?

FYI - I'm not a gold buyer.  I've been very vocal against 3rd party gold buying.  You can check my comment history if anyone has doubts.
            Everything is logged in servers. Its not like they checked me for no reason. My guess is the seller got caught, and traced to me when it happened. Or something flagged them on my end and then a small investigation saw i got a mail of 100k gold by someone sending and receiving lots of gold. They wouldn't ban for no reason.
            Nah this appears to be fine. My bf has been sending me his overflow of T1 materials and extra gold (he just loves the cute outfits on my sorc so it‚Äôs been a bit of extra gold to fund skins lmao) and I haven‚Äôt been hit with a ban hammer. I‚Äôll edit this post if I do, but so far so good! I‚Äôve even been purchasing lawmaker/platinum skins off the market too so ü§ûü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
        It's important to know what to expect from an MMO.

I really hope they can get a handle on the bots. The new player experience is pretty crummy atm and not the best first impression.
Taking out the garbage, LETS GOOOO
    reddit's anti-user changes are unacceptable
        I don‚Äôt view third party different than first tbh‚Ä¶  The game is only banning it because they want to be the sellers.  I could care less.  If anything it was just a way to whale if you were on a budget.  I have more respect for that than real whales.

There ya go.
Can we get a before and after comparison of the Berserker population?
I am honestly quite curious how this works out. The steam charts data showed less than 1 Million accounts playing concurrently the last few days. Don't you need a steam account to play to show up on the list?

How can you ban this many accounts if there are less active accounts?
    My theory's that bot accounts are disposable, they progress them to a certain point and never touch it again after transferring the gold. These just stockpile over time to the current amount.
    Because you need to understand how the bot works. Its only 3% of the entire game community botting. But the bot itself lets you run 6 instances at a time.
The bot takes 3 hours per account. So thats 8*6 =48
So one botter goes through 48 accounts in a day. 
That's 21,000 or so botters. Which is under 3% of the population. so if we base it on 21,000 bot users and multiply that by 6, that's 126,000 bots MAX online at the same time at any given moment. The number is less but thats on the highest estimate.
The real issue is the nature of the bot. As 3% of the population can scale the bot that high. If amazon stopped multiboxing alone, it would make economy normal because only 3% of the game would be botting. Instead we have to multiply that by 6 or more.
        You forget they run multiple sets of multiple instances. One person could easily be running 10+ sets of 6 accounts at a time. 

I have some friends who used to bot lineage 2 and it wasn‚Äôt uncommon for one of them to be running 48+ accounts at a time.
            This isnt accurate as im in the scene and have personally been shown this. 6 bots use more than 32gb ram and nobody is using servers for these currently as they lack the support. Have friends in Chinese forums for this bot specifically. Maybe in the future but as of right now no. 6 windows use currently 36gb ram on lowest setting. I have friend showing with resource monitor open. And on top of that, it currently does not allow multiple instances, only the built in multibox.
                why wouldn't a botter just invest in 64gb or even 128gb ram if it's their main income job?
    ????
you flag the bots over the period of time, says 2-3 weeks. Then on a 4th week, you ban them all in one go.
You dont log in admin and ban a million accounts every day.
    From my understanding these bots stop at a certain point in levelling anyway and the account is simply unused from there.

There are probably hundreds of thousands of dormant bots that don't log in any more that will be banned.
Pog big W
Did they already ban them cuz today on peak hours in euc i had only 2k q instead of the usual 12k
I will continue to report all bots .. good that they're doing something about it.
Thank goodness. I report them every time I see them.

A million bots banned, but there is already a million more to take their place. They need another solution, because banning the accounts isn't going to stop them from making a million more.
1M lmao
Noone here talks about most important thing lol‚Ä¶ its 1 MILLION accounts just for bots. 

Says a lot about real concurrent player numbers and what we see on steam lol.
    The ban have happened and the number only went down by about 100k.

The bots are definitely not the majority, and most of those accounts are likely using a steam bypass to begin with in order to be able to multibox like 20 characters at once.
It's free to play... they will be back.
    They‚Äôre already back and there‚Äôs numerous sighting reported on the official forum, the banning effort was pathetic lol.
They should also ip ban them so the money(gold) they transferred it to is  also gone and they can never come back for being filthy cheaters
Great... i will be heavily surprised if this wont cause heavy amounts of false banning of players. Because Amazons automated systems never worked without major flaws...
Man, imagine having GM's in this day and age. They could be instantly banning these players lol
    even MMOs with GMs dont instantly ban players
        I remember my days on some browser MMOs 10y ago, many were banned instantly just for talking inaproprietly, even when tried to hide it. There really was moderators lurking. Dunno how it's not the same ever since then
Fucking brilliant! These basement virgin bitchass cheaters can suck my fat choad.
Keep those banning coming, sick of those teleporting bots.
I report/block like double digit bots daily the gold spammers gotta go. Players can make plenty gold with the in game systems.
2 million more will be created.

Hail hydra!
It's nice that they ban them now, but the gold they generated has contributed to inflation so much and it's probably still circulating.
So whats stopping them from just creating new accounts and keep going?

Leveling is fast af and the game is f2p.

Good to see then doing something, but just dont know if this is enough=/
I  have a Zerker main and I'm actually a bit worried about my safety
There so many new bots running around now (half using blatant teleport hacks) XD Think everyone just made new account.
Okay, now do it every day, multiple times a day, so the gold farmers never have a chance to build their stocks and completely trash the economy.

Because the damage is already done.  Things that were 20g on release week are now 500. Things that were 400 are now 5000.

FFXIV bans bots every week.  SE hasn't done anything to stop the bots from existing in the first place in a decade of the game being live. There's still hundreds running on every single server every day.  Luckily, in that game, gil is nowhere near as farmable so the economy is quite stable in comparison, but my point is that unless there's methods put in place to stop it in the first place, the problem will never go away.
And just like the hydra, 2 million more will pop back up lmao
Imagine if they gave us gold everytime we report a botter and it successfully gets banned, easy goldüëåüôÉ
    Easy gold is the problem. They'll just make bots to report their other bots to farm gold and then sell that
My understanding is that bots would remain connected most of the day... So if Lost Ark had 1M player daily pr√©e ban, how many are actual players?
hope they ban buyers too
Usually a 8-16k queue depending when I decide to play on a Saturday and today, instantly got into the game in peak hours!
gold farmers and botters decided to spam 2x to 4x more after the banwave and are still botting hard lol
i spent foraging by monastery this morning, its like they never left.
1 million new accounts created
Bots: "hail hydra"
2 millions in the next day.
They could buy some gold and monitor where they're getting it from to ban the mules and outweigh the generation. (I hope they have some sort of trade monitoring)
Nothing changed
What's stopping them from making more? Banning seems to be a temporary solution, but doesn't tackle the root of the issue.
    Maybe read the post. They say they are taking further steps with respect to anti cheat, further bans and improving detection methods.
        That's a losing battle though.
            So you're suggesting they should just sit and do nothing
                You ban buyers.

Sellers don't care if they get banned, it's bots, they don't get tired of farming and by the time you get them they already made money.

Buyers? Oh boy, they really don't want to get banned. Sure, some don't care since they will just whale a new account, but most are not like that.

From the moment buying gold from bots gets risky people will stop doing it. It's not worth it.
                    [deleted]
                        Thing is they're not paying you right now but bots.
            It‚Äôs almost always a losing battle unless irl action is taken.
    [deleted]
        The only thing I can think of is locking chat and require that someone complete a PvE quest chosen at random for that character and be 50+.
So like 5% of total bot accounts? Also is Roxx the only mod for this game or what?
Will they also remove the "badly programmed bots" that I get in my pugs? :P
    My day of reckoning has finally arrived.
I feel like the damage to the econ already has been done, price of crystals have doubled every week and is getting out of reach, I should have gotten more back when I started.
    The crystal trade going up is due to creators saying it's a good idea to exchange and the player base doing it en masse. It's FOMO speculation right now. You'll be fine.
    thats naturally going to happen the gold price for crystals in other region is 1500+ and eu is the only one that can buy aura with them do its going to go even higher
It was based today I couldn't find enemies for quests cause they were all speedkilled
Easiest fix for this is to require a valid phone number/SSN that can only be used once to create an account like they do in korea. EZ Clap
    No thanks. I have zero interest in giving bezos or any game company my social.
        I can tell you, bezos already knows exactly what your asshole looks like in great detail
            Nah.
        The US is so weird with making people think the SSN is this number that should be treasured and kept secret.

That number is not a secret, you've applied to jobs before I'm sure and you have to put it on every application lol.
            Yes. Jobs. Credit cards. Banks. All things that warrant the use of my SSN. A video game is not one of those.
                Then don't play I guess?

I personally hope games do adopt this eventually, or some way of tying identity to a game account.

It immediately gets rid of a large source of the botting plague as well as account selling.

It also is by far the most effective anti-cheat since you can't just make another throwaway account easily.
    SSN? Nah, no thanks. Phone number I can get behind.
    I‚Äôd love that personally. I‚Äôve got nothing to hide & all of our data is being tracked anyway.
        not sure if sarcastic or braindead
    Phone number would be fine.

While it wouldn't stop it, it would still slow it down quite a bit.
Imagine getting thousands of sim cards to run an operation, that might even trigger some investigation from the phone company or local govt, because of how suspicious it is. 

And even if it's easy and non suspicious to buy that many sims, it would still eat into their profit margin
    Do you realize what an ssn is....?
        kr uses ipin which is essentially a masked ssn
Really good news but I also don‚Äôt trust Amazon and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if my account is somehow banned
Waiting for the Amazons screw up like New World and banning innocent accounts.
This won't do much tho. What they need to do is lock trading behind something bots can't do, like abysal dungeons or a special quest
Only one real tool is needed‚Ä¶ is the character a berserker that never uses a Mount?  If yes, then ban it.
That's fine. All well and good. But don't waste all that gold. Why don't you be like Robin hood AGS and ration out the gold as a gift to the community.
I‚Äôll continue to report scammers and bots. As long as Amazon is taking the right steps I‚Äôm happy to do my part.

Fuck RMTs
So we giving them time in advance to move all their resources?
So... We had a max of 1. 3 milion players. Almost one milion bots were banned. Today we have almost 700k players. Something is not right with this math.
    There can be 3-5.000.000 Lost Ark accounts and 700.000 logged atm. :)
Sweet release all those names too!
    Yeah dang it really hurts to not be able to name myself Wrejlowjl or Aashwiowp.
        excuse me my great great grandfather was named wrejlowjl he was the greatest blacksmith in his 18th century polish village
[deleted]
    I may be overestimating Amazon, but if Amazon was even remotely competent, this would be the dumbest thing for botters to do. It would quickly identify accounts either centralizing or buying gold. Most MMOs trace gold flow for illegal RMTs.
        [deleted]
    probably what they are hoping for to highlight mule accounts they may have missed
[removed]
    400k = 1-2+ million players. Still pretty healthy in my book
    thats quite an exaggeration
        If they hopefully also ban those buying gold from the bots? Nope. :)
            "illegitimate bot accounts" and people buying gold from them are two very different things. No one buying rmt gold got banned in the other regions, they just got sent into the negative for the gold they bought, say -20k. 

I feel this punishment is effective enough as it would really suck to have happen but you'd still be able to play at least. They'd probably bank on people buying from the cash shop to level their negative balance.
                Haha whatever.

I didn't expect anything else than a bunch of degenerate clowns buying gold with real money from chinese bots while photographing their monitor to show off with that dank T3 gear

So many downvotes by idiots crying about bots but then buy gold from them. You guys are the reason why this world is fu**ed
So one bot runs 6 characters at a time (on average. Need crazy specs for more)
Lets take 1 million bans.
It takes 3 hours per account 24 hours in a day. 
One bot user goes thru 48 accounts in a day.
That's 21k bot users. 
21k bot users is under 3% of the game population. 

The issue is the way the bot works. If each bot can run 6 accounts. That 3% of the game turns to 18% 
Meaning for every 10 real players, close to 2 players are botting gold 24 hours a day. 

There aren't many botters in this game, just the type of bot being around is fucked up.

Its a VERY SMALL portion of people using a bot that scales wide. More than 96% players are legitimate. And if the bot didn't scale the way it did, many wouldn't do it as its not as profitable either. There are many modern ways to ensure a game isnt running multiple instances. That would be one HUGE impact against the current bot if they truly cant get rid of it.
Unfortunately, I was one of those banned, and I have not heard anything from Amazon after submitting an appeal.
please dont ban me i am a player who moves like a bot, i am a real human player >.<
Lol don't use chat üòÜ so never talk to someone
Just create a ticket if you got banned by accident, says Amazon. Those overseas contractor paid by the number of tickets they close will totally waste their time and their wages by forwarding your ticket to Amazon so they can unban you, rather than completely ignoring your request so they can maximize the number of closed tickets.
I blame the people buying gold more than I blame the sellers. The sellers are simply filling a marketplace desire, if AGS/SmileGate banned the buyers the market would cease to exist.
you also should allow us to BLOCK MORE THAN A 100 Bot. Allow us to BLOCK Gold sellers UNLIMITED. **THANKS**
Those of you using afk scripts to be online 24/7 can also fuck off now, ty.
No wonder bots are advertising gold sales by 50% discount now LOL!

Anyways, can we somehow convince Putin to just nuke the country where these gold sellers are residing? Would solve a lot of problems, cause Biden aint doing jack shit against these parasites -\_-
This is probably a horrible question, but I‚Äôm curious. How are they removing over 1 million accounts when there are only ~640,000 (taken at time of post) players online?
    Concurrent doesnt mean total players bud.
    Bots don‚Äôt have to be online to be removed
        Right.   
I guess the *real* question i have then is, are they being removed from Steam accounts? Or is there a way to play this game without Steam in NA/EU?

Because if so, we'd just be left with the peak player's (1.3 million) minus the projected bot removal of "over 1 million", right?
    Admin flagged the accounts over a period of time, lets say 2-3 weeks. then ban them in one go. you dont ban a milion account everyday. we all get banned based on your logic.
But when I say only about 30% of the playerbase are legitimate I get down voted to hell.
    [deleted]
        not really, it's well known that at least 50% of the old school runescape playerbase are bots (at the time a mass ban wave hits the conccurent players halves for the week following than the week preceeding), his prediction is at least possible when a botting communities very well could have been prepared for a disgustingly large operation with the western release. Over 1 million bots caught in one month is insane and equal to a several month period between ban waves on osrs
[deleted]
Hope the queues will ease off after that (one can hope..)
This is fantastic! How did you set up that notification? Is it an official discord?
Million accounts holy shit
When will this happen? i mean the Time
Hope they‚Äôre targeting people who bought the gold along with the bots
Wonder if that will hold up in the long run? The bots can just make new accounts with barely any effort, those tools better be good at detecting them again.
A million? Wait. So what does that mean for the million active per day player count?
oooh yeah thats good news, if they don‚Äôt come back the next day! its a free to play after all
Thank fucking gawd..
Good
Not bad
Hopefully I don't get banned accidentally and that this will end up reducing the queueing times or even eliminating it
About time, that one spot in Retharmis with 4 bosses is filled with botters and hackers.
Thank fuck. It's annoying seeing tons and tons of blatant hacking bots speeding around the maps.
*Checks gold to crystal price*
Wait so the steam stats numbers are just bots T.T
Oh thats why there wasn't much que on my server ü§£ü§£
I million is the entire active steam player base in NA.
How about those buying from them?
I really hope we don't get a mega ton of false bans.
Lets goooo, i will be finally able to see area chat
1million lol !%$%!% bots
And 1 million will replace them.
And 1 million will replace them.
Damn, steam stats gonna drop by 110%
Never encountered any bot but sounds awesone
Daily in Yudia has you pick up 20 relics in a quest area.. found a spot with two close to each other and stay there and just keep grabbing them.

Also a main quest thing there.. so there is a constant train of bots coming in.  While waiting for the relics to respawn I report them for 3rd party/speed hacks/automated game play.

It ain't much, but it's honest work.
Jesus
Kinda scared lol i have 6berserkers
It's good to see our collective & persistent reporting has resulted in action. Although this is going to be an ongoing problem, at least we know we aren't reporting for nothing.
I haven't been able to access the game today and their website wont let me in either. Im hoping im not in the list and its just some downtime dont wanna miss my daily reward
A lot of impatient people forget that taking down bots in any meaningful capacity takes time and can be an enormous pain in the ass. Good work from the devs!
Good
didnt work. still bots in game
YAY!!!! Good job and thank you Amazon and Smilegate RPG!!!
Ahh...so *that's* how they got those numbers.
FINALLY.
are servers down for anyone else?
Honestly great news, I‚Äôve been reporting every bot I‚Äôve come across so at least that feels worthwhile. 

That being said, I have a completely irrational fear my account is going to get banned because of how much I‚Äôve been spamming ‚Äú!!!!!‚Äù In chat when using sight focus. 99.999% sure that wouldn‚Äôt happen but ugh why do I think like an idiot.
Yay! 2 million more to go!
Good. Get rekt.
Wonder how the steam numbers are gonna look.
Hopefully crystal prices go down. 200G to 800G in 10 days is insane gold inflation.
i report like 20 accounts on a daily basis
Actually impressed they reacted so fast, well done on this one guys!
Lol that‚Äôs fine. We‚Äôll be back with even more üòÇ
I feel like people who bought from bitters should be banned too
I wonder what this will do to the player stats
I'm praying for that Berserker that I reported yesterday because he was standing in a pile of Berserker bots and I just kind of assumed he was one as well.
1m bots wow
I'm sure MANY will come to this reddit to claim they were erroneously banned, but in reality they were probably botting an alt account to farm gold.
And two billion bots will replace them lol
The queue in thirain was 800 ay 8pm, they've actually started doing i think
Mari went from 5800 at 9pm to 540 at 9pm.   


Damn.
Considering how much Amazon has screwed up in the past, I'm sort of terrified that they will screw this up and ban innocent players
Incoming swath of complaints from hundreds of customers who accidentally get deleted and lose gear/progress. The fact they have a system in place for people to ask why their account was deleted let‚Äôs me know they already expect it to happen. With how I‚Äôve seen customer service go for many people I worry some people are about to have their accounts go bye bye for good.
2 weeks to late
RIP lost ark steam chart player count
Today i spotted a bot for the first time on SA server and  started to panic. Good news.
seems they need to ban way more. i have noticed no difference....incredible that there are probably over 3-4 million bots. at what point do we consider maybe half the total playerbase is a bot?
true roleplay: 2 bots with GPT3 talking to each other in facility 301-x
    Role play bots would be a service to the community, it‚Äôs like open source canon and NPCs!

Wish I could make a couple bots running around identifying animals and talking out loud like they are a couple of biologists. You can make anything!

I would like to imagine the world of lost ark has zoos
        That just gave me an idea of an MMO where all the NPCs are actually just employees of the game company roleplaying.
            Thats just the real world with extra steps.
                But *Inside* your own home!
            You want a Disneyland MMO?
            Something like that has been announced, check out "War of Dragnorox". Personally, I don't think this game is going anywhere though.
        A very long time ago in maple story, there was a short lived bot in the free market lobby that was reading out the Bible or something, on a very visible platform that couldn't be reached by legit means at the time. If you dropped mesos on the ground, it would vacuum loot it, pause and say thank you for the donation, then resume where it left off. I really didn't know what to make of it lol. I can probably still count on one hand how many times I've seen non malicious hacking since then.
            Flashback to college days when there was always somebody evangelizing in a prominent speaker's circle...
Very clever.
"These bots were not found to be in violation of the terms of service, and enriched the culture of the lonely island experience. We find them not guilty."

*And that, little Timmy, is the story of how bots took their first step towards getting rights, and the eventual enslavement of mankind.*
I would love to see a picture of this!
    Ol' Garv & Teri.

wai wat
They fckin whisper you at this point if you dare to write in general... I'm smashing that report butt like a mad man.
    I swear im like the only one who has not gotten a whisper at all and im relatively active in area chat. I also usually report and block all the spammers before i start talking though cause then i cant even see whats going on in chat til they're gone
        Bruh you don‚Äôt even have to be talking in chat at this point. I was afk for like 2 mins docked at an island and I got a whisper. Later on, I see the spam text in area chat, and the text bubble is from the boat next to me (different bot). They‚Äôre getting more advanced
            i was eating at benihanas and the chef whispered in my ear if i wanted to buy 1k gold for 80 cents
            sometimes they spam as soon as you join the area, they might have some tools to know all the players in the area and spam them all
        I think its if you mention gold. I take on area chat and the first time I talked about gold I was whispered
        There should be a chat filter which let's you block certain words. In WoW there is an addon for this.
        Same LOL I'm like wtf even is whispering but also I'm thankful I've not been whisper spammed to
    Smash that butt, bro!
    I thought it was so funny when I got 4 paragraphs in a row in a pm. I feel like it was a drive-by too I dont even talk in area
        Maybe it's the emotes you do for quests they use to start the whisper
    you dont even need to write mate i was passing by and suddenly got 3whisper spams without even writing anything
    When I logged in to do chaos dungies I got whispered by one no longer than 2 minutes after I was in game without using chat, it‚Äôs wild on the server I‚Äôm on
        Procyon is nuts too, like 20 bots all the same clothes. Same gddgdgdsss names etc flying fast asf round, faster than my mount haha
Yep every time I teleport I spend a minute reporting it seems. Doing my part.
    Same here, [I'm doing my part!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_7FaWnlhS4)
Started leveling my 5th character(previous 2 alts boosted and 1 knowledge transfer) yesterday and it's just depressing. I see couple different bots per minute, 100s per hour and it's just one channel on one server. Makes me wonder how much of current online population is actually bots because I would wager it's quite a sizeable %.  

If it was my first character I would straight up quit when 99% of characters you see are bots. They really need to get better anti cheat.
üòÜ mini game with no reward, I have been investigating and reporting the URLs, DNS and subdomains.
Why would you level 3 when you have power pass and knowledge transfer?
    Maybe they used them already? So 3 chars after powerpass?
        Well, there's knowledge transfers as well still.
            i like leveling, its chill mindless gaming when i just wanna relax.
                I normally do to, but it's just too much click/G spam for me, with mediocre quests, a not very interesting storyline that's got a mediocre translation (Why are there so many inconsistencies in how something is translated? Why do subtitles not match the voice acting? And it seemingly only gets worse the further in I go. Can definitely tell it was translated by a group of people that did not communicate with each other very much. But enough of me ranting about the translation quality).

The main saving grace is the dungeons, and a few points in the story (namely the sieges), which is a shame, as this is otherwise a very good game.

So yeah, given the choice, I'd definitely choose skip as much as humanly possible every time myself.

Anyway, sorry for this way too long reply to just a simple message about how you enjoy leveling. Guess I just needed to get this off my chest. I love this game, but oh boy is the story a chore to get through.
                    If you pay attention you can see changes and improvements every play-through. As far the subtitles go they are often more up-to-date and accurate than the voice lines so hopefully they rerecord those later.

Localization work is actually hard and tedious. It is also all done blind so not every translator is aware of what everyone else is doing and this is no doubt made much worse by the lack of in-office interactions. Also the toolset is often really clunky which makes iteration slow.

As long as they continue to clean things up each maintenance it will get better fairly quickly.
            Also I know lots of ppl are sick of the storylines but I just love it. Still working on my main and powerpassed two alts but I can't wait to redo the story. I can't get enough
                I bought a new switch and cap for the G key, so now I can level at least two more chars before I need more replacement parts
                I don't find the story that good to be honest, I don't want to waste like 20 hours doing the story again. But each person with their own things.
                    I mean honestly its nice that they even provide an avenue at all to fast track  alternate characters for free. Most games would just have you level from scratch again or pay money to fast track through the story
                        This game has to be the most respectful game out right now. They understand convenience doesn't have to be a commodity that is bought and sold.
                I‚Äôm glad someone likes it
            And dont you have to get to luterra to use KT?

            That costs a shit ton of gold that people don't have this early unless whaling.
                If 600 gold is a shit ton to you we are playing very different games
                    I legit got 10k in one day in T2 (granted I ran 2 legendary maps, but still)
                ?????? 600 is a shit ton of gold? Any lvl 50 char can make at t1 as much in WAY less time than the time you waste by lvling 50 chars.

You are literally wasting progress if you don't KT with no exceptions. The time you waste to level up accounts could be used top farm multiple times this gold and/or progress


tl;dr there is no reason to manually raise an alt unless you plan on making more than 12 characters
                    I level mine manually so i can try the class. Instead of wasting my powerpass or gold in something i dont like. If i end up not liking more than 6 classes ill just repeat my main with power pass.
                        Problem is that you cant possibly know that until you reach endgame.

I was leveling soulfist and felt so fun but on actual bossing with actual skillset I just don't like her. Nothing wrong with her I'm not going to complain its just not for me

On the contrary gunslinger, I hated her early (I kt'ed her and ditched her) but I picked her up again, tested more skills and now she is much more fun both time to hunt and shotgun build (I mostly use time to hunt cause the lack of skillpoints hurt)

Its really hard to know in advance, worst case you just ditch it and keep it for daily slave. I have 8 chars right now, 2 of them are stationary at 340, they don't even do gaurdians/chaos but they login daily for the 4 bifrost points to do me some work. One day I might delete them but for now they earn their keep
                    how do you make 600 golds? currently at T1 and struggling to make even 20 gold per hour
                        Selling all the tradeable matts on tradehouse you get nets you a lot. It probably comes out to about 1/4th of your total matts so it will increase the time it takes you to tier up a bit, but those matts won't be worth nearly as much for very long.

Chaos Gates give maps and these maps usually contain the fail% honing material and sometimes leapstones, which can be sold for a decent amount. Also can get skillbooks. If you manage to bid on the legendary map then you can probably sell the spots (haven't done this personally but the maps are usually about 2-3k atm in tier 2!).

Selling adventure tome consumables has net me a lot of $$. There is a limit to how many the whales will need to complete, so the matts for those should also eventually be cheaper.

All in all its slower progression in trade for more gold, which lets you buy the crystalline aura relatively easily. IMO it's worth doing for that alone as a free to play player.
                        The "Chaos Gate" event can be done once a day per Roster, and at the end a Legendary Map is put up for bid; the 30 players involved in the Gate Event bid against each other and if you don't win it you get your share of the winning bid. I've seen a Map go for 7k Gold (>230 gold).

&#x200B;

Between this and selling unbound Stones from my T1 alts Guardian Raids (I only do them when I have the double harvest up) I would say I'm consistently making 400g a day for about an hours effort
                    > tl;dr there is no reason to manually raise an alt unless you plan on making more than 12 characters

What about grinding for the Lostwind Cliff set?
                        Remind me again, isn't that the set that drops from abyss? I don't recall any way to farm this up by 1-50 leveling
    Some people are saving the power pass for new classes that are coming out.
        With just 600 gold you can do knowledge transfer and get your character to lvl 50 with vern quest done.
        really stupid idea, though. powerpasses have a timelimit and so far all newly released classes came with a pass in the other regions
            Wait they have a time limit? I honestly had no idea well I guess I have to use my second one now
                They don't have time limit once you claim them, you can just save them, Chech the top right corner in server select and it tells you that you have a powerpass available in your server with no time limit
                They don‚Äôt have a time limit. They can be held for as long as you need them.
            On the login screen it shows there is not a time limit when you have one avalible.
                then they must have removed it, i am sure my tickets on ru had them and i have seen others talk about it too when west released. nvm then
        gj for the minus IQ play, you not only have wasted gold you also slowed down your mains progeess, cuz you get a free char slot and punika boost with all the classes coming out for free and a gearing even too
    There's still some merit to learning a class by playing it through the leveling process.  Just depends on how you like to play.

Edit: why would this be downvoted?  A lot of people enjoy the leveling process, not everything has to be speed rush min/max endgame only focused
        that's true, i used powerpass and i feel so disconnected from my class abilities. reading 20 abilities that all say " does 2000 damage" and 100+ perks at once doesn't really work.Shooting them at random during chaos dungeon isn't working out either because the party overshadows you.

that said the campaign is horribly long and you rarely fight, so it truly is a bit too much for the purpose.I gladly go through the 6-8 hours super linear and fight-filled campaign in Path Of Exile everytime, but Lost Ark questing an entire continent a second time can't be digested as easily.
        if only msq wasnt sooooo long and forced , outside annika u cant skip anything afaik.

i hated leveling alts on FFXIV because was boring w/o quests or repeating msq ...but oh boy now i understand why.
            The sad thing is that you spend more time running around NOT killing monsters, I cleared all quests on my main and really wasn't feeling like this was a combat game. I don't think I can face the "plot" more than once.
        [deleted]
            So playing a class more doesn't teach you how to play a class?  I never said it was the only way to learn, but playing with the abilities as they come can show you what works well as the game progresses.

There's not really a wrong way to do it, powerpass or level.  Depends on what the player enjoys and how much time they have.
        Getting used to a powerpassed alt... I felt like I might've just leveled it up on the story lol.
        Yeah guys mobile gamers lives matter damn
    It can be fun.
    what does knnowledge transfr do?
        It‚Äôs essentially a boost. The only one that is actually worth it is the lvl 10-50 boost. You can only skip story sections past 50. So if have a tier one char I can‚Äôt boost the ilvl with it. But once I get to 600 you can use knowledge transfer to skip the story.

This process also takes 8 hours it isn‚Äôt instant. All these reasons are why the 10-50 is the only one actually worth it.
            so with that can i move my level 52 and gearscore 960 to another class if i wanna play something different?
    [deleted]
        wut? You have 9 knowledge transfers available. You level one main + 2 free power passes + 9 knowledge and you are at 12 characters already. If you are a masochist and want all classes you just need to level up 3 of them.
            You can only knowledge transfer based on how many you have done Vern with, and knowledge transferred characters don't count. So first character and 2 power passes allows you 3 knowledge transfers.
            [deleted]
                You get 9 Vern knowledge transfers for finishing the Vern story once.
        Why would you want to make 15 classes? You have to pay real money btw to unlock more char slots.
            Because no life, what else you gonna do
                Get to tier 3? Do endgame content? Farm gold? Explore other places? There much things to do instead of just going trough a lot of chars from 10 to 50 XD
                    Knowledge transfer them all, literally 0 need to level again
        I have 1 Artillerist, 1 Deadeye, 1 Striker, 1 Gunlancer, 1 Bard, 1 Gunslinger and 6 Paladins. I leveled all of those characters from scratch except for 5 Paladins which are Transfer Knowledge and the Gunlancer and Bard which are Powerpasses.
    because the reasons other people have said. But also the easiest way to get some card duplicates (including Solus) is to level an alt. 

Also get a chunk of heart currency which is just a plus.
I was working on an alt.. the cathedral in Prideholme is an endless stream of Rakjjfpabalksd names. In less than 10 mins I had 30 reported and blocked.. and I missed almost half.. They're like ants.
Same! Ive gotta be at 200+ blocked at this point.
    Block list caps at 100, unless you mean between all characters.
        I kinda wish there was no cap, same with friends list I don't understand why there is a cap. Maybe its a limitation I just have no idea about?
        Welp then I guess it's capped lolol I know I've definitely reported 200+. At one point I needed a break from doing collectibles and island and just city/channel hopped with the sole purpose of reporting for a sold hour.
    The max is 100 unfortunately. Have been manually cleaning my block list, so tedious. I guess it was worth it after all!
How did you not turn out of energy? I can barley tradeskill for an hour before I‚Äôm buying pots to last about 30 minutes.
Like you have just leveled them for fun? I have six 50s and could only manage that once. The story is decent, but not so good I'd want to play through it multiple times.
    Hey, I‚Äôm planning on having 12 chars end game so will need to level some to 50 for knowledge transfer. Also I enjoy playing a new class through the story just to learn spells. I don‚Äôt follow guides or the meta so I like to feel it out.
        Wanting to play through the story again is a completely valid reason to do so, but just an FYI that the Vern transfer is special and unlocks 9x by completing the story on just one character. You can get 12 L50 characters with only one manually leveled, two powerpassed, and nine knowledge transfers.
Newbie here. I was doing a salt giant with another dude and this rando comes up and one shots 18 bars. Should I have reported him for hacks or does end game dmg really allow such a thing?
    I could do that at tier 2. It was probably me.
How do you report them? I can't even read the names with them zooming
    click on the name in chat and you'll get the option to report/block etc.
        I mean those who teleport leveling / farming via bot and don't chat spam :(
            Oh yeah, tricker those!  I'll be logging or mining and see hundreds run by, I guess there's not an easy way to report them as they are gone so fast, and teleport on the run.  Hope today really does help.
this is exactly what I would program my gunlancer bot to say‚Ä¶
**sweats in Zerker main**
#facts - never have I seen a group of gunlancers traipsing around
    True seems like 90% of them are zerkers though.
        And the other 10% are sorc
        Paladin underrated
        That includes the zerker I matched with in Abyssal last night, right? Right? :(
    Levelling gunlancer is fucking pain.

Did it once and since then, straight to vern pass or memory trasnfer.
    not a group, but lve seen 3 badly scripted gunlancer bots that were runing to the same points but not killing the mobs lol
        > but not killing the mobs lol

O-our damage is fine!
I'm worried though because I mad an alt berserker. It was a moment of weakness...
Being last person left alive in cube bomber round as Chad lancer felt amazing.
    Chadlancer should be the official name. Those guys just dont give a shit. Seeing a grabbed chadlancer grabbed by vertus taking absolutely no fucking dmg...i mean come on.
im one of like 5 sharpshooters in existence. no way i could be banned
Do you save a counter attack during raids at all times? I feel like every Lancer I play with hits every one but when I try they are on CD a lot.

Also can we not counter attack from the side of monsters?
    I'll hold on to dash upper fire, but use bash as the start of my rotation. You must hit them from the front for a successful counter.

Dash upper fire also has high stagger and weak point, so it will be used for those moments on bosses too.
    Yeah it‚Äôs annoying. I try to keep my counter for stuns or for breaking barriers, but I feel like they only glow blue/purple if they are facing away from me or I used it already for their stagger period.

What doesn‚Äôt help is each guardian and boss seems to have a completely different radius in front of them that you can hit.
Cause he‚Äôs so slow xD
Get ready for all the "Amazon banned my account for no reason!!!" posts
    Automod gonna get a workout for sure.
        The sadistic part of me loves the thought of a script banning someone in Lost Ark and then another banning them on reddit for crying about it.
            Sounds like satan
    Coming for many, many, MMOs, all these "banned for no reason" posts on the internet are usually from hackers/cheaters trying to get sympathy 99% of the time. Best part about those posts are when GMs or someone from support coming in and showing all the shit they did that got them banned.

Yes, there are people who get hit by system by accident, but they usually just go through the usual route and get their account back easily.
        The good ole jmod smackdown
    This is AGS, for once I'm gonna trust the people saying they got banned for no reason.
        Yeah because people on the internet never lie.

I don't believe AGS will not mistaken ban people but at the same time I don't trust people to not lie about the reason why they get banned, too.

Lose lose situation.
            AGS will definitely mistakenly ban people. It's a given it happens with every ban wave and every autoban system. At the same time people are definately gonna lie because nobody is gonna admit they're a botter and a gold seller who spams area chat.  


I think the ban wave will do more good for the game but hopefully support can address the people who were mistakenly banned and unban them in a timely manner and hopefully the autoban is a decent bit accurate as to not ban a ton of legitimate people
                > I think the ban wave will do more good for the game 

I haven't been back to the starting areas yet but it hasn't really lessened the gold selling spam at all.

The issue with free to play games is that it costs the gold sellers nothing to make a new account, it's the flaw in the model.

Charge $10 for the game and you lessen that quite a bit.
            I've got false ban for trade macro in a god-damn EvE just a month ago. Got 15 days Omega for free and personal email with apology from Senior GM. 

I know 10 years old youtube channel with thousands of videos and in total millions of views that got deleted, because strike bot fucked up and strike the same video three times (in row), that was manually checked as OK. This was the first time I saw a machine take the live hood of a man and get him on the bring of suicide.  Not a SINGLE person looked into it. 

It happens a lot, when everything is checked by algorithm without human inputs.

Amazon has a receipt for people being banned for no reason in their games, just by chatting or fishing. FFS, they couldn't even be bothered to prevent client input (TEXT INPUT!) fucking with other clients. Why would I give any benefit of the doubt to these lazy wankers...

It's always the righteous that screams first when they get on the bad side...
                I'm perfectly aware that false positive bans can, will, and have happened.

But like I said, people also like to lie about reasons why they get banned, too.
        Yeah trust the whole wave of people coincidentally whining about it during bot ban waves, good call.
            I‚Äôm more likely to believe someone who claims to have been erroneously caught up in a bot ban-wave than I am to believe someone who claims to have been erroneously banned in a lone hit.
                I'm more likely to believe it's people just not accepting consequences.  Speaking as someone that has (and still does) lost more than a couple accounts (rightfully so) in ban waves.
            Well there will be false positives, so an influx of complaints when a ban wave hits kind of makes sense
            At this point I really hope you get wrongfully banned so I can throw your post right at you and laugh.
            When you ban 1m accounts at the same time then yeah you get everyone whining at the same time.

I wouldn't be surprised if they just did something like banning everyone who got reported more than 3 times or something like that lol.
            i guess you never played NW or read about it
            If it was any other publisher.. yeah, but we talking AGS.
            If it were anyone but Amazon lol.
        Why? Amazon is good at customer service. It is employees they have a record of not treating well.
    tbh, until AG is able to provide proof or specific infos about bans, players that comlain about false bans should get the benefit of the doubt.

That is a problem AG is doing to themselfes AND people that got illegitimately banned dont even know why and wont get any answeres for that too or possibilities to fight that decison. AG plays plaintiff and judge at the same time and you as the "victim" cant do anything against this.
        Have you, brother, seen AGS support?
        > tbh, until AG is able to provide proof or specific infos about bans

That's something all games do though, not specific to Lost Ark or AGS.
        >players that comlain about false bans should get the benefit of the doubt.

Not really since this has happened A LOT in online games and it easily ends up being revealed that they did deserve the ban.
            Except most cases so far seem to imply Amazons support is incompetent. They've acknowledged that they have incorrectly banned people via the commerce ban already.

Edit: Proof of acknowledgement by them since everyone seems to be jumping to Amazons defence with 0 clue what they are talking about.

Support says it's affecting multiple people and should be fixed all at once.
                and then they said all those bans are rmt bans and everyone i know that got banned did in fact rmt.
                    No they never, stop talking shit.

2 giant threads where roxx asked people for their names to help them out, both with dozens of people proving they didn't refund anything. She also said the team are investigating it.

https://forums.playlostark.com/t/another-permabanned-thread/229785

https://forums.playlostark.com/t/commerce-lock-ban-permanent/229396

Both of these threads have numerous examples of their support being provided with evidence of no refunds and continuing to say there was a refund, while asking for the evidence they had already been provided.

The fact that your 2 friends RMT and got banned for it is irrelevant.
                        https://forums.playlostark.com/t/banned-for-purchasing-skin-from-ah/229315/71

You are on the 3rd stage of grief.  Anger. You or your friend cheated and bought gold, the account is never coming back.  I don't believe you didn't RMT and i really don't care about what excuse you come up with next.
                            Most people that claim to be falsely banned deserve it but what about the ones that didn't? Fuck 'em for being unlucky?

False positives happen and I sincerely hope one day you'll get caught in one.
                                The thing is they are all getting banned for refunding, when 90% are able to provide proof they didn't.

If they are being banned for RMTing that should be the reason they are banned and supplied with but it's not. Prior poster is just a dipshit.
                            I haven't been banned, your dumb fucking assumptions further proving how much of a moron you are.

Even if your theoretical situation was true and all those people were banned for RMTing why is support still saying it's for a refund? Incompetent either way but go off, idiot.

Some more proof for you dumbass -

"This is not a single issue affecting just you this will be fixed for everyone at once"
                They haven't acknowledged that they have incorrectly banned anyone, unless you're referring to something else than the OP.

As with every ban wave in every game there's going to be people complaining that they got unfairly banned. They are merely saying please direct those appeals to <<here>>. That doesn't mean that they knowingly falsely banned people at all
                    I linked the threads further down.

Saying you are investigating every one of these bans and names would be helpful with that implies it's abit more than just "The norm." It is not normal for Community managers to get involved in the usual CS tickets.

That's without even mentioning that 90% of people in those threads provided proof they never refunded via screenshots of their steam history. There is LITERAL PROOF provided.

They are even warning that they are going to falsely ban people in the bot wave, enough so that they announced it. 

Some more proof -

Yes I'm embellishing a little here, but it wasn't that far off.

Though to be fair there were actually one or two legit false flags. Like someone getting banned because of a report. But for the most part it was just glorious.
            ‚ÄúAll‚Äù of them? 100%?

Are you saying the dev responded to every complaint and proved each one was legit? Or is it possible that a decent number were mistakes, but you just didn‚Äôt notice that because it wasn‚Äôt as entertaining?
        [deleted]
            No gold site. Had some experiences with AGs banning-behaviour prior to launch in the forum. After 90 days of activity and 5 days reading time (approaching launch) my more critical comments got deleted without any good reason and shortly after i got my permaban. And you neither know why or are able to fight that.

Of course its easy to assume that all of those people are guilty, as long as you are not the victim, but AG also has a bad history with automated bans in New World too.
And with the last wave of complains CMs admitted that there were a good amount of false bans, what at the same time proves, that they were lying for weeks now with denying that automated bans happen without any employee in between.
That they are not providing prove is as much a problem for them, as it is for the players and Community,because nobody knows if they are valid.
                > And you neither know why or are able to fight that.

That's how things work everywhere though.
                    >That's how things work everywhere though.

So thats fine and okay? Wouldnt care about a plattform, where i never did spend a penny (So i dont care about the forum a lot tbh), but when people got falsly banned in a game where they already spend a lot of money, it is problematic.
                        > So thats fine and okay?

Yes? Not sure what kind of answer you are looking for here.

> but when people got falsly banned in a game where they already spend a lot of money, it is problematic.

I don't think I said otherwise, when it comes to people who actually got wrongfully banned.

I just said these companies don't disclose the reason/why/where/when/how a person got banned for. That's information cheat makers can use to improve their cheats.
                            Yeah, i guess the info "banned for name XY", showing the accusations of reports or specify what their systems thought, what happened, like for RMT "got X amount of gold from bot Srdfgionuze", is something those botters will have the info from, to improve their cheats. I mean, realy? They dont need to show the code of their auto-ban-systems, but provide simple info, where people are A: able to prove if they are falsly banned or B: pay more attention on, when its just a timeban for "inappropriate behaviour" or some sort of combination of letters, that could be missinterpreted in names.

Not to mention that botters wouldnt care at all. Thats a Free2Play-game. They just make another Account and start from the beginning. Thats also why the ban-wave that got announced wont have a large impact on bots at all. But there will be false bans and i think there will be a lot of them.
        Found the botter
        It's tough because the more information AG provides, the more information botters have to work with to avoid automated bans.  Honestly I'm unsure what the correct balance is, but I do think the emphasis should be on not falsely banning legitimate players rather than on catching every bot.

RIGHT??????
                                Except you weren't playing, you were sitting in a city doing nothing while an auto clicker kept you in the game
    So, wait, are we not allowed to be salty if our account does get banned for no reason? I paid real money for a founder pack and some extra gems on top of that. As of today, I can't log in. Never used any sort of automation. Never bought or sold gold. I've only ever played the game by sitting at my computer, clicking, and pressing 'g' and a few other keys.
I was fishing on the left side and watching netflix on the right for 7 hours straight with 3 total breaks to make a sandwich, get more water or piss. I‚Äôm kinda worried I‚Äôll be in the ban wave lol
    new game: Fishing bot or virgin (I too can fish in mmos for 7 hours straight)
        lmao fishing mini game = good game, no fishing mini game = bad game.
    Always wait for the first banwave to see what is caught before doing any fishing scripts üëç
        I haven‚Äôt done any scripts lol, but to the game it might look like it
            it wont look like it unless you have the same delay everytime u fish or something
                Oh yeah I guess that‚Äôs true, since the fishing timing isn‚Äôt the same every time I should be good then! Plus I failed to catch the fish sometimes during good parts of my shows lol
100% , I myself have reported about a dozen of accounts who did that shit on Kadan EU-Central.

On one hand it really sucks that players even get the intention to do these things because servers are overpopulated. On another hand it's totally justified for all those people who had to wait longer in queue because bobby from the neighborhood didn't wanna log out.
    I was reporting g pretty heavy at the beginning but soon got tired of the clicks and typing for each one. At least in WoW I had a macro that automatically sent a report of my target but ultimately bots are the reason I left that game.
queues existed from day 1 on my euc server even before people  started to stay afk
Yesterday everything worked perfectly,matchmaking,entry to chaos dungeon,queue etc.I really hope they continue banning these bots and maybe think of something more strict cause they will be the ruin of this game,They already drove blue crystals prices to 800+ gold,this is insane to be happening ,the game is barely a month out.
Queues have been better for me the last couple of days so they might already be banning them.
They got themselves to blame, unfortunately.
Good, fuck these macros. I know for some people it was the only solution but it's wrong. 
Even tho Amazon is to blame.

Still, everyone who used it should know that this stuff will eventually get you banned
    THIS.

Today after maintenance, EUC suddenly went from 8k queue to 1k queues for the entire rest of the day.

Instead of sitting in queue for 2 hours, people waited just 10 minutes.

It's disgusting how the queue wouldn't be a problem anymore if we didn't have so many macro abusers desperately trying to be online all day, just to play for 20 minutes in the evening.
Why would they ever include something like that in the bot detection system? Do you really think bots are the ones being afk or that it'd even make sense to ban players for anti-afking?

Please devs give me a one-click "report for gold selling" instead of making me type a gibberish message every time.
Speed hacking.
    I heard that they were actually teleporting and them running faster is just the game trying to make sense of it
        They're speed hacking, they're tele hacking, and they're noclip hacking.  
  
EAC isn't doing much :p
            true, after all, it's called easy anti cheat because it's easy to bypass

        Editing character movespeed in RAM and bad server-side checks that don't catch it (or maybe they do but they don't instaban)
            Insta banning is bad because it just lets script programmers trial and error their hacks
                [deleted]
                    I‚Äôm not proud of this but I developed botting scripts for another popular MMO and the most frustrating thing with the development process was trialing a new script I wrote, seeing it work for a few days, then having the account banned after a couple days. Was it the amount of time played? Hours played per day? IP address? Specific problem with the script that could be auto detected? Was I reported by a player? 

All of those questions are unknowns because it was impossible to pin down exactly what triggered the ban. And the feedback loop to improve the botting script would take multiple days just to realize it needed further updating.  If instabanning was utilized, I would‚Äôve known exactly what caused my bots to get caught, and I would ALSO have a very good understanding of how their bot detection system works. Part of the beauty of not getting instabanned is the mental game it puts on botters and bot devs. We don‚Äôt know precisely how the bot detection system works, so as a result all the ‚Äúanti-detection techniques‚Äù that we cake into our scripts is purely conjecture and rumor for how we think the bot detection system works. These smoke and mirrors effects would evaporate the second instabanning is implemented.

Hopefully this provides some insight into why instabanning is not the ultimate solution that you might (logically) assume it to be.
                    If you let botters trial and error hacks it would become much, much worse than the situation you described.

You might not be aware but your opinion on the matter is siding with and supporting the botters.

                            it's not about winning, it's about doing the better option.

instantly banning is the worse option.
They've probably already flagged all the accounts they're going to ban in this wave.
Perhaps this will spook them into trying to offload gold from bot accounts. That can then be traced to accounts not caught in the ban wave that are involved?
    200 IQ play.
    Maybe it's a perfect bait to then ban accounts that gold is offloaded to.

The real 200 iq play
accounts are already flagged any interaction with other accounts will probably get those accounts flagged too or at least investigated.
I‚Äôve noticed queues on my server in EUC dropping massively the last few days. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this has been underway for a while & is only just being announced.
Due to the short timeframe bot makers wont have time to do anything meaningful anyway.
All the people running anti-AFK macroes are going to flood this subreddit with "false positives" ;p
Agreed, gold buyers should also be banned. No demand == no incentive for gold sellers.
    Something misunderstood by a lot of people posting here...
        I don't think those posters are misunderstanding, I think they're the gold buyers.
            Probably.
    [removed]
    Less demand  = cheaper gold. Lmao
My friend bought gold and proceeded to brag about his ilvl. Please ban him I beg you.
    Literally the top 5 in my guild went from 1300 to 1350 in like 3 days and proceeded to brag about how you can get 1k gold for 70c
        [deleted]
            They both said they would have spent almost 250$ on gold to get to where they are
        What‚Äôs sad is it‚Äôs not even hard to make gold at t3. My guild lead has 5k crystals and 125k gold. I made 13k in 3hr
I think the problem with buyers is that it's a lot harder to prove and confirm they actually bought gold than it is to determine that an account is botting or selling. The in-game transaction won't involve any real-world money so what makes a seller account sending someone gold any different than me sending one of my friends gold?

Sure, if you can trace a bot account back to the seller account they off-load to and then trace those back to the people they send gold to chances are pretty damn good those people bought gold but how do you prove that the person actually bought the gold for real money? Should you be banned if a bot just randomly sends you 100k gold by accident and you accepted it because hell yeah, free gold?
    Ah the ‚ÄúI have no idea why I got gifted free gold from bot‚Äù defense. It‚Äôs pretty weak lol.
        I'm sorry officer, I didn't know I couldn't do that.

        People are listing them for 30-50k sometimes more. No one is buying them. You search sold items and what they sold for. The highest accessory I saw was like 25k a few days ago. Most good items were selling around 10k there was less than half a page that sold for over 10k. I am referring to useable gear (accessories) only.
        amateur. https://i.gyazo.com/6df16bb9172b190a2577ce487649037e.png
They are already banning gold buyers (permanently). A decent amount of screenshots came up recently, so the first gold buying wave should have already been sent out.
    Source?
Evidence? lol
[deleted]
    2 of my accounts been banned for gold buying. Did 100k. Though i believe it was because i bought the gold on an alt lvl 10 and sent it to myself on main to try and be sneaky and that triggered something. They both received red game ban text on steam as well. But you wont have many people like me coming forward and being honest about it. Who wants to admit they got banned for that. 
I deserve it and no excuse, just saying that they have at least started an "effort". Out of 20 people i know in a community, 4 got bans. Thats a start. They were all buyers.
        Perma ban or temp?
Paying real money to buy royal crystals to buy gold: reddit sleeps.

Paying real money to buy gold from a third party: real shit
    honestly i view it as the same‚Ä¶. my only real interest in this article is how much this will cause the game population to go down?
Soon all the gold sellers will realize its not worth it, gold is worth literally zero. The game throws more gold at you than you will ever possibly need at t3.
    But you can literally get anything with gold
        Silver is the cap, ive been in tatters rerolling my gems.
            I think you can convert gold to silver at an npc
                The ratio is ghastly, 1k gold equals 100k silver. Thats 3 gem reforges @ 36k a pop.
                    reforging a gem is basically always a mistake. Just sell the one you dont want and buy the one you want.
                        There is some skills that just dont sell. Ive gotten hook chain 4 times in a row xd.
Unfortunately, yes. Our hope is that AGS continue to track and ban them untill they decide it's not worth it anymore.
More like two million
200 000 units ready with a million more well on the way.
They need to IP block China and just be done with it.
    or bind the one time gold to the account so it can't be traded.
Being completely honest here. I tried to buy gold once as I got annoyed because of gem prices being devalued and its no excuse at all.
I bought it to an alt, then sent from alt to main just in case. 
Both accounts got banned. They were not just any ban, but it also gave me red text saying game ban. Now maybe transferring the gold with same IP triggered it. But its at least good news. Right now playing clean and I'm glad i got banned tbh. Playing much more relaxed now and with friends more. Definitely not worth buying gold.
    Ss or didn't happen.
        https://imgur.com/a/FhCm9ym

I can give SS of payment for gold too lmao. Trust me they are banning slowly... Very few people will come clean about it and heck I learned my lesson and playing clean now. Much more relaxed too. Also in forum post, roxx did say a lot of the people trying to appeal for the refund bans going around, were trying to sneak in and actually got caught buying gold. They are permanently banning gold buyers lmao. But who would admit it? And plus the sellers aren't bothered if buyers banned. They get more, sell more, space it between many accounts, etc. So obviously it isn't slowing anything down. But it is true amazon is banning people. Nobody will show you this though, why would they shame themselves? Yeah some will always get through the cracks. But if my 100k one time payment got me banned and 100k barely makes a difference end game... I can imagine people buying more could be tracked fairly easily too.
            What time were you exactly banned at? Also did you buy it from a site posted in chat?
                Didnt use a chat advertised place, but I'd assume those are riskier. It took 9 days to get banned after buying. I assume if the seller gets banned for it on a storage account, they track those who stuff was sent to. Thus i got hit. Its cat and mouse, but at least they are slowly working on it.
                    Thanks for the incite. Looks like I‚Äôll prob get hit then with a ban. If I don‚Äôt by some miracle I‚Äôll stop buying gold. GodSpeed.
                        Some will always slip through. You may be fine. But in the end it isn't worth it. In the moment it feels great. But there's people who spend $20,000 and then it devalues fast. Plus after Argos we may get t3 boosts or honing boosts. Its just...not worth it.. i regret personally. Hopefully you'll be fine, but i now stand with others in being against it. Since it devalues so quickly, the only thing its doing is raising crystal prices which hurts all.
            Cool, time to start spending 70 cents to get a "present" delivered to assholes in chat.
    Thanks for being honest.  But it begs the question, what if you share an IP with someone as in family member or roommate and you give each other free gold or gear?  Would that be auto ban?

FYI - I'm not a gold buyer.  I've been very vocal against 3rd party gold buying.  You can check my comment history if anyone has doubts.
        Everything is logged in servers. Its not like they checked me for no reason. My guess is the seller got caught, and traced to me when it happened. Or something flagged them on my end and then a small investigation saw i got a mail of 100k gold by someone sending and receiving lots of gold. They wouldn't ban for no reason.
        Nah this appears to be fine. My bf has been sending me his overflow of T1 materials and extra gold (he just loves the cute outfits on my sorc so it‚Äôs been a bit of extra gold to fund skins lmao) and I haven‚Äôt been hit with a ban hammer. I‚Äôll edit this post if I do, but so far so good! I‚Äôve even been purchasing lawmaker/platinum skins off the market too so ü§ûü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
    It's important to know what to expect from an MMO.
Exponential grind
reddit's anti-user changes are unacceptable
    I don‚Äôt view third party different than first tbh‚Ä¶  The game is only banning it because they want to be the sellers.  I could care less.  If anything it was just a way to whale if you were on a budget.  I have more respect for that than real whales.
        [deleted]
I went to Prideholme because one quest told me to go there, and I got so scared to see bot accounts pop up every second. Every. Second... It's insane. The amount of accounts that are being created is unbelievable.


There ya go.
My theory's that bot accounts are disposable, they progress them to a certain point and never touch it again after transferring the gold. These just stockpile over time to the current amount.
Because you need to understand how the bot works. Its only 3% of the entire game community botting. But the bot itself lets you run 6 instances at a time.
The bot takes 3 hours per account. So thats 8*6 =48
So one botter goes through 48 accounts in a day. 
That's 21,000 or so botters. Which is under 3% of the population. so if we base it on 21,000 bot users and multiply that by 6, that's 126,000 bots MAX online at the same time at any given moment. The number is less but thats on the highest estimate.
The real issue is the nature of the bot. As 3% of the population can scale the bot that high. If amazon stopped multiboxing alone, it would make economy normal because only 3% of the game would be botting. Instead we have to multiply that by 6 or more.
    You forget they run multiple sets of multiple instances. One person could easily be running 10+ sets of 6 accounts at a time. 

I have some friends who used to bot lineage 2 and it wasn‚Äôt uncommon for one of them to be running 48+ accounts at a time.
        This isnt accurate as im in the scene and have personally been shown this. 6 bots use more than 32gb ram and nobody is using servers for these currently as they lack the support. Have friends in Chinese forums for this bot specifically. Maybe in the future but as of right now no. 6 windows use currently 36gb ram on lowest setting. I have friend showing with resource monitor open. And on top of that, it currently does not allow multiple instances, only the built in multibox.
            why wouldn't a botter just invest in 64gb or even 128gb ram if it's their main income job?
????
you flag the bots over the period of time, says 2-3 weeks. Then on a 4th week, you ban them all in one go.
You dont log in admin and ban a million accounts every day.
From my understanding these bots stop at a certain point in levelling anyway and the account is simply unused from there.

There are probably hundreds of thousands of dormant bots that don't log in any more that will be banned.
The ban have happened and the number only went down by about 100k.

The bots are definitely not the majority, and most of those accounts are likely using a steam bypass to begin with in order to be able to multibox like 20 characters at once.
They‚Äôre already back and there‚Äôs numerous sighting reported on the official forum, the banning effort was pathetic lol.
even MMOs with GMs dont instantly ban players
    I remember my days on some browser MMOs 10y ago, many were banned instantly just for talking inaproprietly, even when tried to hide it. There really was moderators lurking. Dunno how it's not the same ever since then
Easy gold is the problem. They'll just make bots to report their other bots to farm gold and then sell that
Maybe read the post. They say they are taking further steps with respect to anti cheat, further bans and improving detection methods.
    That's a losing battle though.
        So you're suggesting they should just sit and do nothing
            You ban buyers.

Sellers don't care if they get banned, it's bots, they don't get tired of farming and by the time you get them they already made money.

Buyers? Oh boy, they really don't want to get banned. Sure, some don't care since they will just whale a new account, but most are not like that.

From the moment buying gold from bots gets risky people will stop doing it. It's not worth it.
                [deleted]
                    Thing is they're not paying you right now but bots.
        It‚Äôs almost always a losing battle unless irl action is taken.

    The only thing I can think of is locking chat and require that someone complete a PvE quest chosen at random for that character and be 50+.
My day of reckoning has finally arrived.
The crystal trade going up is due to creators saying it's a good idea to exchange and the player base doing it en masse. It's FOMO speculation right now. You'll be fine.
thats naturally going to happen the gold price for crystals in other region is 1500+ and eu is the only one that can buy aura with them do its going to go even higher
No thanks. I have zero interest in giving bezos or any game company my social.
    I can tell you, bezos already knows exactly what your asshole looks like in great detail
        Nah.
    The US is so weird with making people think the SSN is this number that should be treasured and kept secret.

That number is not a secret, you've applied to jobs before I'm sure and you have to put it on every application lol.
        Yes. Jobs. Credit cards. Banks. All things that warrant the use of my SSN. A video game is not one of those.
            Then don't play I guess?

I personally hope games do adopt this eventually, or some way of tying identity to a game account.

It immediately gets rid of a large source of the botting plague as well as account selling.

It also is by far the most effective anti-cheat since you can't just make another throwaway account easily.
SSN? Nah, no thanks. Phone number I can get behind.
I‚Äôd love that personally. I‚Äôve got nothing to hide & all of our data is being tracked anyway.
    not sure if sarcastic or braindead
Phone number would be fine.

While it wouldn't stop it, it would still slow it down quite a bit.
Imagine getting thousands of sim cards to run an operation, that might even trigger some investigation from the phone company or local govt, because of how suspicious it is. 

And even if it's easy and non suspicious to buy that many sims, it would still eat into their profit margin
Do you realize what an ssn is....?
    kr uses ipin which is essentially a masked ssn
There can be 3-5.000.000 Lost Ark accounts and 700.000 logged atm. :)
Yeah dang it really hurts to not be able to name myself Wrejlowjl or Aashwiowp.
    excuse me my great great grandfather was named wrejlowjl he was the greatest blacksmith in his 18th century polish village
I may be overestimating Amazon, but if Amazon was even remotely competent, this would be the dumbest thing for botters to do. It would quickly identify accounts either centralizing or buying gold. Most MMOs trace gold flow for illegal RMTs.
    [deleted]
probably what they are hoping for to highlight mule accounts they may have missed
400k = 1-2+ million players. Still pretty healthy in my book
thats quite an exaggeration
    If they hopefully also ban those buying gold from the bots? Nope. :)
        "illegitimate bot accounts" and people buying gold from them are two very different things. No one buying rmt gold got banned in the other regions, they just got sent into the negative for the gold they bought, say -20k. 

I feel this punishment is effective enough as it would really suck to have happen but you'd still be able to play at least. They'd probably bank on people buying from the cash shop to level their negative balance.
            Haha whatever.

I didn't expect anything else than a bunch of degenerate clowns buying gold with real money from chinese bots while photographing their monitor to show off with that dank T3 gear

So many downvotes by idiots crying about bots but then buy gold from them. You guys are the reason why this world is fu**ed
Concurrent doesnt mean total players bud.
Bots don‚Äôt have to be online to be removed
    Right.   
I guess the *real* question i have then is, are they being removed from Steam accounts? Or is there a way to play this game without Steam in NA/EU?

Because if so, we'd just be left with the peak player's (1.3 million) minus the projected bot removal of "over 1 million", right?
Admin flagged the accounts over a period of time, lets say 2-3 weeks. then ban them in one go. you dont ban a milion account everyday. we all get banned based on your logic.
[deleted]
    not really, it's well known that at least 50% of the old school runescape playerbase are bots (at the time a mass ban wave hits the conccurent players halves for the week following than the week preceeding), his prediction is at least possible when a botting communities very well could have been prepared for a disgustingly large operation with the western release. Over 1 million bots caught in one month is insane and equal to a several month period between ban waves on osrs
Role play bots would be a service to the community, it‚Äôs like open source canon and NPCs!

Wish I could make a couple bots running around identifying animals and talking out loud like they are a couple of biologists. You can make anything!

I would like to imagine the world of lost ark has zoos
    That just gave me an idea of an MMO where all the NPCs are actually just employees of the game company roleplaying.
        Thats just the real world with extra steps.
            But *Inside* your own home!
        You want a Disneyland MMO?
        Something like that has been announced, check out "War of Dragnorox". Personally, I don't think this game is going anywhere though.
    A very long time ago in maple story, there was a short lived bot in the free market lobby that was reading out the Bible or something, on a very visible platform that couldn't be reached by legit means at the time. If you dropped mesos on the ground, it would vacuum loot it, pause and say thank you for the donation, then resume where it left off. I really didn't know what to make of it lol. I can probably still count on one hand how many times I've seen non malicious hacking since then.

    Did you take this picture with a ü•î?
I swear im like the only one who has not gotten a whisper at all and im relatively active in area chat. I also usually report and block all the spammers before i start talking though cause then i cant even see whats going on in chat til they're gone
    Bruh you don‚Äôt even have to be talking in chat at this point. I was afk for like 2 mins docked at an island and I got a whisper. Later on, I see the spam text in area chat, and the text bubble is from the boat next to me (different bot). They‚Äôre getting more advanced
        i was eating at benihanas and the chef whispered in my ear if i wanted to buy 1k gold for 80 cents
        sometimes they spam as soon as you join the area, they might have some tools to know all the players in the area and spam them all
    I think its if you mention gold. I take on area chat and the first time I talked about gold I was whispered
    There should be a chat filter which let's you block certain words. In WoW there is an addon for this.
    Same LOL I'm like wtf even is whispering but also I'm thankful I've not been whisper spammed to
Smash that butt, bro!
I thought it was so funny when I got 4 paragraphs in a row in a pm. I feel like it was a drive-by too I dont even talk in area
    Maybe it's the emotes you do for quests they use to start the whisper
you dont even need to write mate i was passing by and suddenly got 3whisper spams without even writing anything
When I logged in to do chaos dungies I got whispered by one no longer than 2 minutes after I was in game without using chat, it‚Äôs wild on the server I‚Äôm on
    Procyon is nuts too, like 20 bots all the same clothes. Same gddgdgdsss names etc flying fast asf round, faster than my mount haha
Same here, [I'm doing my part!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_7FaWnlhS4)
Maybe they used them already? So 3 chars after powerpass?
    Well, there's knowledge transfers as well still.
        i like leveling, its chill mindless gaming when i just wanna relax.
            I normally do to, but it's just too much click/G spam for me, with mediocre quests, a not very interesting storyline that's got a mediocre translation (Why are there so many inconsistencies in how something is translated? Why do subtitles not match the voice acting? And it seemingly only gets worse the further in I go. Can definitely tell it was translated by a group of people that did not communicate with each other very much. But enough of me ranting about the translation quality).

The main saving grace is the dungeons, and a few points in the story (namely the sieges), which is a shame, as this is otherwise a very good game.

So yeah, given the choice, I'd definitely choose skip as much as humanly possible every time myself.

Anyway, sorry for this way too long reply to just a simple message about how you enjoy leveling. Guess I just needed to get this off my chest. I love this game, but oh boy is the story a chore to get through.
                If you pay attention you can see changes and improvements every play-through. As far the subtitles go they are often more up-to-date and accurate than the voice lines so hopefully they rerecord those later.

Localization work is actually hard and tedious. It is also all done blind so not every translator is aware of what everyone else is doing and this is no doubt made much worse by the lack of in-office interactions. Also the toolset is often really clunky which makes iteration slow.

As long as they continue to clean things up each maintenance it will get better fairly quickly.
        Also I know lots of ppl are sick of the storylines but I just love it. Still working on my main and powerpassed two alts but I can't wait to redo the story. I can't get enough
            I bought a new switch and cap for the G key, so now I can level at least two more chars before I need more replacement parts
            I don't find the story that good to be honest, I don't want to waste like 20 hours doing the story again. But each person with their own things.
                I mean honestly its nice that they even provide an avenue at all to fast track  alternate characters for free. Most games would just have you level from scratch again or pay money to fast track through the story
                    This game has to be the most respectful game out right now. They understand convenience doesn't have to be a commodity that is bought and sold.
            I‚Äôm glad someone likes it
        And dont you have to get to luterra to use KT?

        That costs a shit ton of gold that people don't have this early unless whaling.
            If 600 gold is a shit ton to you we are playing very different games
                I legit got 10k in one day in T2 (granted I ran 2 legendary maps, but still)
            ?????? 600 is a shit ton of gold? Any lvl 50 char can make at t1 as much in WAY less time than the time you waste by lvling 50 chars.

You are literally wasting progress if you don't KT with no exceptions. The time you waste to level up accounts could be used top farm multiple times this gold and/or progress


tl;dr there is no reason to manually raise an alt unless you plan on making more than 12 characters
                I level mine manually so i can try the class. Instead of wasting my powerpass or gold in something i dont like. If i end up not liking more than 6 classes ill just repeat my main with power pass.
                    Problem is that you cant possibly know that until you reach endgame.

I was leveling soulfist and felt so fun but on actual bossing with actual skillset I just don't like her. Nothing wrong with her I'm not going to complain its just not for me

On the contrary gunslinger, I hated her early (I kt'ed her and ditched her) but I picked her up again, tested more skills and now she is much more fun both time to hunt and shotgun build (I mostly use time to hunt cause the lack of skillpoints hurt)

Its really hard to know in advance, worst case you just ditch it and keep it for daily slave. I have 8 chars right now, 2 of them are stationary at 340, they don't even do gaurdians/chaos but they login daily for the 4 bifrost points to do me some work. One day I might delete them but for now they earn their keep
                how do you make 600 golds? currently at T1 and struggling to make even 20 gold per hour
                    Selling all the tradeable matts on tradehouse you get nets you a lot. It probably comes out to about 1/4th of your total matts so it will increase the time it takes you to tier up a bit, but those matts won't be worth nearly as much for very long.

Chaos Gates give maps and these maps usually contain the fail% honing material and sometimes leapstones, which can be sold for a decent amount. Also can get skillbooks. If you manage to bid on the legendary map then you can probably sell the spots (haven't done this personally but the maps are usually about 2-3k atm in tier 2!).

Selling adventure tome consumables has net me a lot of $$. There is a limit to how many the whales will need to complete, so the matts for those should also eventually be cheaper.

All in all its slower progression in trade for more gold, which lets you buy the crystalline aura relatively easily. IMO it's worth doing for that alone as a free to play player.
                    The "Chaos Gate" event can be done once a day per Roster, and at the end a Legendary Map is put up for bid; the 30 players involved in the Gate Event bid against each other and if you don't win it you get your share of the winning bid. I've seen a Map go for 7k Gold (>230 gold).

&#x200B;

Between this and selling unbound Stones from my T1 alts Guardian Raids (I only do them when I have the double harvest up) I would say I'm consistently making 400g a day for about an hours effort
                > tl;dr there is no reason to manually raise an alt unless you plan on making more than 12 characters

What about grinding for the Lostwind Cliff set?
                    Remind me again, isn't that the set that drops from abyss? I don't recall any way to farm this up by 1-50 leveling
Some people are saving the power pass for new classes that are coming out.
    With just 600 gold you can do knowledge transfer and get your character to lvl 50 with vern quest done.
    really stupid idea, though. powerpasses have a timelimit and so far all newly released classes came with a pass in the other regions
        Wait they have a time limit? I honestly had no idea well I guess I have to use my second one now
            They don't have time limit once you claim them, you can just save them, Chech the top right corner in server select and it tells you that you have a powerpass available in your server with no time limit
            They don‚Äôt have a time limit. They can be held for as long as you need them.
        On the login screen it shows there is not a time limit when you have one avalible.
            then they must have removed it, i am sure my tickets on ru had them and i have seen others talk about it too when west released. nvm then
    gj for the minus IQ play, you not only have wasted gold you also slowed down your mains progeess, cuz you get a free char slot and punika boost with all the classes coming out for free and a gearing even too
There's still some merit to learning a class by playing it through the leveling process.  Just depends on how you like to play.

Edit: why would this be downvoted?  A lot of people enjoy the leveling process, not everything has to be speed rush min/max endgame only focused
    that's true, i used powerpass and i feel so disconnected from my class abilities. reading 20 abilities that all say " does 2000 damage" and 100+ perks at once doesn't really work.Shooting them at random during chaos dungeon isn't working out either because the party overshadows you.

that said the campaign is horribly long and you rarely fight, so it truly is a bit too much for the purpose.I gladly go through the 6-8 hours super linear and fight-filled campaign in Path Of Exile everytime, but Lost Ark questing an entire continent a second time can't be digested as easily.
    if only msq wasnt sooooo long and forced , outside annika u cant skip anything afaik.

i hated leveling alts on FFXIV because was boring w/o quests or repeating msq ...but oh boy now i understand why.
        The sad thing is that you spend more time running around NOT killing monsters, I cleared all quests on my main and really wasn't feeling like this was a combat game. I don't think I can face the "plot" more than once.
    [deleted]
        So playing a class more doesn't teach you how to play a class?  I never said it was the only way to learn, but playing with the abilities as they come can show you what works well as the game progresses.

There's not really a wrong way to do it, powerpass or level.  Depends on what the player enjoys and how much time they have.
    Getting used to a powerpassed alt... I felt like I might've just leveled it up on the story lol.
    Yeah guys mobile gamers lives matter damn
It can be fun.
what does knnowledge transfr do?
    It‚Äôs essentially a boost. The only one that is actually worth it is the lvl 10-50 boost. You can only skip story sections past 50. So if have a tier one char I can‚Äôt boost the ilvl with it. But once I get to 600 you can use knowledge transfer to skip the story.

This process also takes 8 hours it isn‚Äôt instant. All these reasons are why the 10-50 is the only one actually worth it.
        so with that can i move my level 52 and gearscore 960 to another class if i wanna play something different?
[deleted]
    wut? You have 9 knowledge transfers available. You level one main + 2 free power passes + 9 knowledge and you are at 12 characters already. If you are a masochist and want all classes you just need to level up 3 of them.
        You can only knowledge transfer based on how many you have done Vern with, and knowledge transferred characters don't count. So first character and 2 power passes allows you 3 knowledge transfers.
        [deleted]
            You get 9 Vern knowledge transfers for finishing the Vern story once.
    Why would you want to make 15 classes? You have to pay real money btw to unlock more char slots.
        Because no life, what else you gonna do
            Get to tier 3? Do endgame content? Farm gold? Explore other places? There much things to do instead of just going trough a lot of chars from 10 to 50 XD
                Knowledge transfer them all, literally 0 need to level again
    I have 1 Artillerist, 1 Deadeye, 1 Striker, 1 Gunlancer, 1 Bard, 1 Gunslinger and 6 Paladins. I leveled all of those characters from scratch except for 5 Paladins which are Transfer Knowledge and the Gunlancer and Bard which are Powerpasses.
because the reasons other people have said. But also the easiest way to get some card duplicates (including Solus) is to level an alt. 

Also get a chunk of heart currency which is just a plus.
Block list caps at 100, unless you mean between all characters.
    I kinda wish there was no cap, same with friends list I don't understand why there is a cap. Maybe its a limitation I just have no idea about?
    Welp then I guess it's capped lolol I know I've definitely reported 200+. At one point I needed a break from doing collectibles and island and just city/channel hopped with the sole purpose of reporting for a sold hour.
The max is 100 unfortunately. Have been manually cleaning my block list, so tedious. I guess it was worth it after all!
Hey, I‚Äôm planning on having 12 chars end game so will need to level some to 50 for knowledge transfer. Also I enjoy playing a new class through the story just to learn spells. I don‚Äôt follow guides or the meta so I like to feel it out.
    Wanting to play through the story again is a completely valid reason to do so, but just an FYI that the Vern transfer is special and unlocks 9x by completing the story on just one character. You can get 12 L50 characters with only one manually leveled, two powerpassed, and nine knowledge transfers.
I could do that at tier 2. It was probably me.
click on the name in chat and you'll get the option to report/block etc.
    I mean those who teleport leveling / farming via bot and don't chat spam :(
        Oh yeah, tricker those!  I'll be logging or mining and see hundreds run by, I guess there's not an easy way to report them as they are gone so fast, and teleport on the run.  Hope today really does help.
True seems like 90% of them are zerkers though.
    And the other 10% are sorc
    Paladin underrated
    That includes the zerker I matched with in Abyssal last night, right? Right? :(
Levelling gunlancer is fucking pain.

Did it once and since then, straight to vern pass or memory trasnfer.
not a group, but lve seen 3 badly scripted gunlancer bots that were runing to the same points but not killing the mobs lol
    > but not killing the mobs lol

O-our damage is fine!
Chadlancer should be the official name. Those guys just dont give a shit. Seeing a grabbed chadlancer grabbed by vertus taking absolutely no fucking dmg...i mean come on.
I'll hold on to dash upper fire, but use bash as the start of my rotation. You must hit them from the front for a successful counter.

Dash upper fire also has high stagger and weak point, so it will be used for those moments on bosses too.
Yeah it‚Äôs annoying. I try to keep my counter for stuns or for breaking barriers, but I feel like they only glow blue/purple if they are facing away from me or I used it already for their stagger period.

What doesn‚Äôt help is each guardian and boss seems to have a completely different radius in front of them that you can hit.
Automod gonna get a workout for sure.
    The sadistic part of me loves the thought of a script banning someone in Lost Ark and then another banning them on reddit for crying about it.
        Sounds like satan
Coming for many, many, MMOs, all these "banned for no reason" posts on the internet are usually from hackers/cheaters trying to get sympathy 99% of the time. Best part about those posts are when GMs or someone from support coming in and showing all the shit they did that got them banned.

Yes, there are people who get hit by system by accident, but they usually just go through the usual route and get their account back easily.
    The good ole jmod smackdown
This is AGS, for once I'm gonna trust the people saying they got banned for no reason.
    Yeah because people on the internet never lie.

I don't believe AGS will not mistaken ban people but at the same time I don't trust people to not lie about the reason why they get banned, too.

Lose lose situation.
        AGS will definitely mistakenly ban people. It's a given it happens with every ban wave and every autoban system. At the same time people are definately gonna lie because nobody is gonna admit they're a botter and a gold seller who spams area chat.  


I think the ban wave will do more good for the game but hopefully support can address the people who were mistakenly banned and unban them in a timely manner and hopefully the autoban is a decent bit accurate as to not ban a ton of legitimate people
            > I think the ban wave will do more good for the game 

I haven't been back to the starting areas yet but it hasn't really lessened the gold selling spam at all.

The issue with free to play games is that it costs the gold sellers nothing to make a new account, it's the flaw in the model.

Charge $10 for the game and you lessen that quite a bit.
        I've got false ban for trade macro in a god-damn EvE just a month ago. Got 15 days Omega for free and personal email with apology from Senior GM. 

I know 10 years old youtube channel with thousands of videos and in total millions of views that got deleted, because strike bot fucked up and strike the same video three times (in row), that was manually checked as OK. This was the first time I saw a machine take the live hood of a man and get him on the bring of suicide.  Not a SINGLE person looked into it. 

It happens a lot, when everything is checked by algorithm without human inputs.

Amazon has a receipt for people being banned for no reason in their games, just by chatting or fishing. FFS, they couldn't even be bothered to prevent client input (TEXT INPUT!) fucking with other clients. Why would I give any benefit of the doubt to these lazy wankers...

It's always the righteous that screams first when they get on the bad side...
            I'm perfectly aware that false positive bans can, will, and have happened.

But like I said, people also like to lie about reasons why they get banned, too.
    Yeah trust the whole wave of people coincidentally whining about it during bot ban waves, good call.
        I‚Äôm more likely to believe someone who claims to have been erroneously caught up in a bot ban-wave than I am to believe someone who claims to have been erroneously banned in a lone hit.
            I'm more likely to believe it's people just not accepting consequences.  Speaking as someone that has (and still does) lost more than a couple accounts (rightfully so) in ban waves.
        Well there will be false positives, so an influx of complaints when a ban wave hits kind of makes sense
        At this point I really hope you get wrongfully banned so I can throw your post right at you and laugh.
        When you ban 1m accounts at the same time then yeah you get everyone whining at the same time.

I wouldn't be surprised if they just did something like banning everyone who got reported more than 3 times or something like that lol.
        i guess you never played NW or read about it
        If it was any other publisher.. yeah, but we talking AGS.
        If it were anyone but Amazon lol.
    Why? Amazon is good at customer service. It is employees they have a record of not treating well.
tbh, until AG is able to provide proof or specific infos about bans, players that comlain about false bans should get the benefit of the doubt.

That is a problem AG is doing to themselfes AND people that got illegitimately banned dont even know why and wont get any answeres for that too or possibilities to fight that decison. AG plays plaintiff and judge at the same time and you as the "victim" cant do anything against this.
    Have you, brother, seen AGS support?
    > tbh, until AG is able to provide proof or specific infos about bans

That's something all games do though, not specific to Lost Ark or AGS.
    >players that comlain about false bans should get the benefit of the doubt.

Not really since this has happened A LOT in online games and it easily ends up being revealed that they did deserve the ban.
        Except most cases so far seem to imply Amazons support is incompetent. They've acknowledged that they have incorrectly banned people via the commerce ban already.

Edit: Proof of acknowledgement by them since everyone seems to be jumping to Amazons defence with 0 clue what they are talking about.

Support says it's affecting multiple people and should be fixed all at once.
            and then they said all those bans are rmt bans and everyone i know that got banned did in fact rmt.
                No they never, stop talking shit.

2 giant threads where roxx asked people for their names to help them out, both with dozens of people proving they didn't refund anything. She also said the team are investigating it.

https://forums.playlostark.com/t/another-permabanned-thread/229785

https://forums.playlostark.com/t/commerce-lock-ban-permanent/229396

Both of these threads have numerous examples of their support being provided with evidence of no refunds and continuing to say there was a refund, while asking for the evidence they had already been provided.

The fact that your 2 friends RMT and got banned for it is irrelevant.
                    https://forums.playlostark.com/t/banned-for-purchasing-skin-from-ah/229315/71

You are on the 3rd stage of grief.  Anger. You or your friend cheated and bought gold, the account is never coming back.  I don't believe you didn't RMT and i really don't care about what excuse you come up with next.
                        Most people that claim to be falsely banned deserve it but what about the ones that didn't? Fuck 'em for being unlucky?

False positives happen and I sincerely hope one day you'll get caught in one.
                            The thing is they are all getting banned for refunding, when 90% are able to provide proof they didn't.

If they are being banned for RMTing that should be the reason they are banned and supplied with but it's not. Prior poster is just a dipshit.
                        I haven't been banned, your dumb fucking assumptions further proving how much of a moron you are.

Even if your theoretical situation was true and all those people were banned for RMTing why is support still saying it's for a refund? Incompetent either way but go off, idiot.

Some more proof for you dumbass -

"This is not a single issue affecting just you this will be fixed for everyone at once"
            They haven't acknowledged that they have incorrectly banned anyone, unless you're referring to something else than the OP.

As with every ban wave in every game there's going to be people complaining that they got unfairly banned. They are merely saying please direct those appeals to <<here>>. That doesn't mean that they knowingly falsely banned people at all
                I linked the threads further down.

Saying you are investigating every one of these bans and names would be helpful with that implies it's abit more than just "The norm." It is not normal for Community managers to get involved in the usual CS tickets.

That's without even mentioning that 90% of people in those threads provided proof they never refunded via screenshots of their steam history. There is LITERAL PROOF provided.

They are even warning that they are going to falsely ban people in the bot wave, enough so that they announced it. 

Some more proof -

        One of the most memorable reddit threads for me.

Player Y - "I was false banned, I did nothing wrong!!!

GW2 Rep: The chat log shows you saying "You fucking f\*\*\*ots I hope you all die."

Player Z - "I was flagged for my name but it is not offensive at all"

GW2 Rep: Your name was TheHollocastWasALie

\---

Yes I'm embellishing a little here, but it wasn't that far off.

Though to be fair there were actually one or two legit false flags. Like someone getting banned because of a report. But for the most part it was just glorious.
        ‚ÄúAll‚Äù of them? 100%?

Are you saying the dev responded to every complaint and proved each one was legit? Or is it possible that a decent number were mistakes, but you just didn‚Äôt notice that because it wasn‚Äôt as entertaining?
    [deleted]
        No gold site. Had some experiences with AGs banning-behaviour prior to launch in the forum. After 90 days of activity and 5 days reading time (approaching launch) my more critical comments got deleted without any good reason and shortly after i got my permaban. And you neither know why or are able to fight that.

Of course its easy to assume that all of those people are guilty, as long as you are not the victim, but AG also has a bad history with automated bans in New World too.
And with the last wave of complains CMs admitted that there were a good amount of false bans, what at the same time proves, that they were lying for weeks now with denying that automated bans happen without any employee in between.
That they are not providing prove is as much a problem for them, as it is for the players and Community,because nobody knows if they are valid.
            > And you neither know why or are able to fight that.

That's how things work everywhere though.
                >That's how things work everywhere though.

So thats fine and okay? Wouldnt care about a plattform, where i never did spend a penny (So i dont care about the forum a lot tbh), but when people got falsly banned in a game where they already spend a lot of money, it is problematic.
                    > So thats fine and okay?

Yes? Not sure what kind of answer you are looking for here.

> but when people got falsly banned in a game where they already spend a lot of money, it is problematic.

I don't think I said otherwise, when it comes to people who actually got wrongfully banned.

I just said these companies don't disclose the reason/why/where/when/how a person got banned for. That's information cheat makers can use to improve their cheats.
                        Yeah, i guess the info "banned for name XY", showing the accusations of reports or specify what their systems thought, what happened, like for RMT "got X amount of gold from bot Srdfgionuze", is something those botters will have the info from, to improve their cheats. I mean, realy? They dont need to show the code of their auto-ban-systems, but provide simple info, where people are A: able to prove if they are falsly banned or B: pay more attention on, when its just a timeban for "inappropriate behaviour" or some sort of combination of letters, that could be missinterpreted in names.

Not to mention that botters wouldnt care at all. Thats a Free2Play-game. They just make another Account and start from the beginning. Thats also why the ban-wave that got announced wont have a large impact on bots at all. But there will be false bans and i think there will be a lot of them.
    Found the botter
    It's tough because the more information AG provides, the more information botters have to work with to avoid automated bans.  Honestly I'm unsure what the correct balance is, but I do think the emphasis should be on not falsely banning legitimate players rather than on catching every bot.

So, wait, are we not allowed to be salty if our account does get banned for no reason? I paid real money for a founder pack and some extra gems on top of that. As of today, I can't log in. Never used any sort of automation. Never bought or sold gold. I've only ever played the game by sitting at my computer, clicking, and pressing 'g' and a few other keys.
new game: Fishing bot or virgin (I too can fish in mmos for 7 hours straight)
    lmao fishing mini game = good game, no fishing mini game = bad game.
Always wait for the first banwave to see what is caught before doing any fishing scripts üëç
    I haven‚Äôt done any scripts lol, but to the game it might look like it
        it wont look like it unless you have the same delay everytime u fish or something
            Oh yeah I guess that‚Äôs true, since the fishing timing isn‚Äôt the same every time I should be good then! Plus I failed to catch the fish sometimes during good parts of my shows lol
I was reporting g pretty heavy at the beginning but soon got tired of the clicks and typing for each one. At least in WoW I had a macro that automatically sent a report of my target but ultimately bots are the reason I left that game.
THIS.

Today after maintenance, EUC suddenly went from 8k queue to 1k queues for the entire rest of the day.

Instead of sitting in queue for 2 hours, people waited just 10 minutes.

It's disgusting how the queue wouldn't be a problem anymore if we didn't have so many macro abusers desperately trying to be online all day, just to play for 20 minutes in the evening.

    Editing character movespeed in RAM and bad server-side checks that don't catch it (or maybe they do but they don't instaban)
        Insta banning is bad because it just lets script programmers trial and error their hacks
            [deleted]
                I‚Äôm not proud of this but I developed botting scripts for another popular MMO and the most frustrating thing with the development process was trialing a new script I wrote, seeing it work for a few days, then having the account banned after a couple days. Was it the amount of time played? Hours played per day? IP address? Specific problem with the script that could be auto detected? Was I reported by a player? 

All of those questions are unknowns because it was impossible to pin down exactly what triggered the ban. And the feedback loop to improve the botting script would take multiple days just to realize it needed further updating.  If instabanning was utilized, I would‚Äôve known exactly what caused my bots to get caught, and I would ALSO have a very good understanding of how their bot detection system works. Part of the beauty of not getting instabanned is the mental game it puts on botters and bot devs. We don‚Äôt know precisely how the bot detection system works, so as a result all the ‚Äúanti-detection techniques‚Äù that we cake into our scripts is purely conjecture and rumor for how we think the bot detection system works. These smoke and mirrors effects would evaporate the second instabanning is implemented.

Hopefully this provides some insight into why instabanning is not the ultimate solution that you might (logically) assume it to be.
                If you let botters trial and error hacks it would become much, much worse than the situation you described.

You might not be aware but your opinion on the matter is siding with and supporting the botters.

    People are listing them for 30-50k sometimes more. No one is buying them. You search sold items and what they sold for. The highest accessory I saw was like 25k a few days ago. Most good items were selling around 10k there was less than half a page that sold for over 10k. I am referring to useable gear (accessories) only.

2 of my accounts been banned for gold buying. Did 100k. Though i believe it was because i bought the gold on an alt lvl 10 and sent it to myself on main to try and be sneaky and that triggered something. They both received red game ban text on steam as well. But you wont have many people like me coming forward and being honest about it. Who wants to admit they got banned for that. 
I deserve it and no excuse, just saying that they have at least started an "effort". Out of 20 people i know in a community, 4 got bans. Thats a start. They were all buyers.
    Perma ban or temp?
honestly i view it as the same‚Ä¶. my only real interest in this article is how much this will cause the game population to go down?
But you can literally get anything with gold
    Silver is the cap, ive been in tatters rerolling my gems.
        I think you can convert gold to silver at an npc
            The ratio is ghastly, 1k gold equals 100k silver. Thats 3 gem reforges @ 36k a pop.
                reforging a gem is basically always a mistake. Just sell the one you dont want and buy the one you want.
                    There is some skills that just dont sell. Ive gotten hook chain 4 times in a row xd.
or bind the one time gold to the account so it can't be traded.
Ss or didn't happen.

I can give SS of payment for gold too lmao. Trust me they are banning slowly... Very few people will come clean about it and heck I learned my lesson and playing clean now. Much more relaxed too. Also in forum post, roxx did say a lot of the people trying to appeal for the refund bans going around, were trying to sneak in and actually got caught buying gold. They are permanently banning gold buyers lmao. But who would admit it? And plus the sellers aren't bothered if buyers banned. They get more, sell more, space it between many accounts, etc. So obviously it isn't slowing anything down. But it is true amazon is banning people. Nobody will show you this though, why would they shame themselves? Yeah some will always get through the cracks. But if my 100k one time payment got me banned and 100k barely makes a difference end game... I can imagine people buying more could be tracked fairly easily too.
        What time were you exactly banned at? Also did you buy it from a site posted in chat?
            Didnt use a chat advertised place, but I'd assume those are riskier. It took 9 days to get banned after buying. I assume if the seller gets banned for it on a storage account, they track those who stuff was sent to. Thus i got hit. Its cat and mouse, but at least they are slowly working on it.
                Thanks for the incite. Looks like I‚Äôll prob get hit then with a ban. If I don‚Äôt by some miracle I‚Äôll stop buying gold. GodSpeed.
                    Some will always slip through. You may be fine. But in the end it isn't worth it. In the moment it feels great. But there's people who spend $20,000 and then it devalues fast. Plus after Argos we may get t3 boosts or honing boosts. Its just...not worth it.. i regret personally. Hopefully you'll be fine, but i now stand with others in being against it. Since it devalues so quickly, the only thing its doing is raising crystal prices which hurts all.
        Cool, time to start spending 70 cents to get a "present" delivered to assholes in chat.
Thanks for being honest.  But it begs the question, what if you share an IP with someone as in family member or roommate and you give each other free gold or gear?  Would that be auto ban?

FYI - I'm not a gold buyer.  I've been very vocal against 3rd party gold buying.  You can check my comment history if anyone has doubts.
    Everything is logged in servers. Its not like they checked me for no reason. My guess is the seller got caught, and traced to me when it happened. Or something flagged them on my end and then a small investigation saw i got a mail of 100k gold by someone sending and receiving lots of gold. They wouldn't ban for no reason.
    Nah this appears to be fine. My bf has been sending me his overflow of T1 materials and extra gold (he just loves the cute outfits on my sorc so it‚Äôs been a bit of extra gold to fund skins lmao) and I haven‚Äôt been hit with a ban hammer. I‚Äôll edit this post if I do, but so far so good! I‚Äôve even been purchasing lawmaker/platinum skins off the market too so ü§ûü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
It's important to know what to expect from an MMO.
Exponential grind
I don‚Äôt view third party different than first tbh‚Ä¶  The game is only banning it because they want to be the sellers.  I could care less.  If anything it was just a way to whale if you were on a budget.  I have more respect for that than real whales.

You forget they run multiple sets of multiple instances. One person could easily be running 10+ sets of 6 accounts at a time. 

I have some friends who used to bot lineage 2 and it wasn‚Äôt uncommon for one of them to be running 48+ accounts at a time.
    This isnt accurate as im in the scene and have personally been shown this. 6 bots use more than 32gb ram and nobody is using servers for these currently as they lack the support. Have friends in Chinese forums for this bot specifically. Maybe in the future but as of right now no. 6 windows use currently 36gb ram on lowest setting. I have friend showing with resource monitor open. And on top of that, it currently does not allow multiple instances, only the built in multibox.
        why wouldn't a botter just invest in 64gb or even 128gb ram if it's their main income job?
I remember my days on some browser MMOs 10y ago, many were banned instantly just for talking inaproprietly, even when tried to hide it. There really was moderators lurking. Dunno how it's not the same ever since then
That's a losing battle though.
    So you're suggesting they should just sit and do nothing
        You ban buyers.

Sellers don't care if they get banned, it's bots, they don't get tired of farming and by the time you get them they already made money.

Buyers? Oh boy, they really don't want to get banned. Sure, some don't care since they will just whale a new account, but most are not like that.

From the moment buying gold from bots gets risky people will stop doing it. It's not worth it.
            [deleted]
                Thing is they're not paying you right now but bots.
    It‚Äôs almost always a losing battle unless irl action is taken.
The only thing I can think of is locking chat and require that someone complete a PvE quest chosen at random for that character and be 50+.
I can tell you, bezos already knows exactly what your asshole looks like in great detail
    Nah.
The US is so weird with making people think the SSN is this number that should be treasured and kept secret.

That number is not a secret, you've applied to jobs before I'm sure and you have to put it on every application lol.
    Yes. Jobs. Credit cards. Banks. All things that warrant the use of my SSN. A video game is not one of those.
        Then don't play I guess?

I personally hope games do adopt this eventually, or some way of tying identity to a game account.

It immediately gets rid of a large source of the botting plague as well as account selling.

It also is by far the most effective anti-cheat since you can't just make another throwaway account easily.

If they hopefully also ban those buying gold from the bots? Nope. :)
    "illegitimate bot accounts" and people buying gold from them are two very different things. No one buying rmt gold got banned in the other regions, they just got sent into the negative for the gold they bought, say -20k. 

I feel this punishment is effective enough as it would really suck to have happen but you'd still be able to play at least. They'd probably bank on people buying from the cash shop to level their negative balance.
        Haha whatever.

I didn't expect anything else than a bunch of degenerate clowns buying gold with real money from chinese bots while photographing their monitor to show off with that dank T3 gear

So many downvotes by idiots crying about bots but then buy gold from them. You guys are the reason why this world is fu**ed
Right.   
I guess the *real* question i have then is, are they being removed from Steam accounts? Or is there a way to play this game without Steam in NA/EU?

Because if so, we'd just be left with the peak player's (1.3 million) minus the projected bot removal of "over 1 million", right?
not really, it's well known that at least 50% of the old school runescape playerbase are bots (at the time a mass ban wave hits the conccurent players halves for the week following than the week preceeding), his prediction is at least possible when a botting communities very well could have been prepared for a disgustingly large operation with the western release. Over 1 million bots caught in one month is insane and equal to a several month period between ban waves on osrs
That just gave me an idea of an MMO where all the NPCs are actually just employees of the game company roleplaying.
    Thats just the real world with extra steps.
        But *Inside* your own home!
    You want a Disneyland MMO?
    Something like that has been announced, check out "War of Dragnorox". Personally, I don't think this game is going anywhere though.
A very long time ago in maple story, there was a short lived bot in the free market lobby that was reading out the Bible or something, on a very visible platform that couldn't be reached by legit means at the time. If you dropped mesos on the ground, it would vacuum loot it, pause and say thank you for the donation, then resume where it left off. I really didn't know what to make of it lol. I can probably still count on one hand how many times I've seen non malicious hacking since then.

Very clever.
Did you take this picture with a ü•î?
Bruh you don‚Äôt even have to be talking in chat at this point. I was afk for like 2 mins docked at an island and I got a whisper. Later on, I see the spam text in area chat, and the text bubble is from the boat next to me (different bot). They‚Äôre getting more advanced
    i was eating at benihanas and the chef whispered in my ear if i wanted to buy 1k gold for 80 cents
    sometimes they spam as soon as you join the area, they might have some tools to know all the players in the area and spam them all
I think its if you mention gold. I take on area chat and the first time I talked about gold I was whispered
There should be a chat filter which let's you block certain words. In WoW there is an addon for this.
Same LOL I'm like wtf even is whispering but also I'm thankful I've not been whisper spammed to
Maybe it's the emotes you do for quests they use to start the whisper
Procyon is nuts too, like 20 bots all the same clothes. Same gddgdgdsss names etc flying fast asf round, faster than my mount haha
Well, there's knowledge transfers as well still.
    i like leveling, its chill mindless gaming when i just wanna relax.
        I normally do to, but it's just too much click/G spam for me, with mediocre quests, a not very interesting storyline that's got a mediocre translation (Why are there so many inconsistencies in how something is translated? Why do subtitles not match the voice acting? And it seemingly only gets worse the further in I go. Can definitely tell it was translated by a group of people that did not communicate with each other very much. But enough of me ranting about the translation quality).

The main saving grace is the dungeons, and a few points in the story (namely the sieges), which is a shame, as this is otherwise a very good game.

So yeah, given the choice, I'd definitely choose skip as much as humanly possible every time myself.

Anyway, sorry for this way too long reply to just a simple message about how you enjoy leveling. Guess I just needed to get this off my chest. I love this game, but oh boy is the story a chore to get through.
            If you pay attention you can see changes and improvements every play-through. As far the subtitles go they are often more up-to-date and accurate than the voice lines so hopefully they rerecord those later.

Localization work is actually hard and tedious. It is also all done blind so not every translator is aware of what everyone else is doing and this is no doubt made much worse by the lack of in-office interactions. Also the toolset is often really clunky which makes iteration slow.

As long as they continue to clean things up each maintenance it will get better fairly quickly.
    Also I know lots of ppl are sick of the storylines but I just love it. Still working on my main and powerpassed two alts but I can't wait to redo the story. I can't get enough
        I bought a new switch and cap for the G key, so now I can level at least two more chars before I need more replacement parts
        I don't find the story that good to be honest, I don't want to waste like 20 hours doing the story again. But each person with their own things.
            I mean honestly its nice that they even provide an avenue at all to fast track  alternate characters for free. Most games would just have you level from scratch again or pay money to fast track through the story
                This game has to be the most respectful game out right now. They understand convenience doesn't have to be a commodity that is bought and sold.
        I‚Äôm glad someone likes it
    And dont you have to get to luterra to use KT?
        Nope just need to unlock songs in prideholm

    That costs a shit ton of gold that people don't have this early unless whaling.
        If 600 gold is a shit ton to you we are playing very different games
            I legit got 10k in one day in T2 (granted I ran 2 legendary maps, but still)
        ?????? 600 is a shit ton of gold? Any lvl 50 char can make at t1 as much in WAY less time than the time you waste by lvling 50 chars.

You are literally wasting progress if you don't KT with no exceptions. The time you waste to level up accounts could be used top farm multiple times this gold and/or progress


tl;dr there is no reason to manually raise an alt unless you plan on making more than 12 characters
            I level mine manually so i can try the class. Instead of wasting my powerpass or gold in something i dont like. If i end up not liking more than 6 classes ill just repeat my main with power pass.
                Problem is that you cant possibly know that until you reach endgame.

I was leveling soulfist and felt so fun but on actual bossing with actual skillset I just don't like her. Nothing wrong with her I'm not going to complain its just not for me

On the contrary gunslinger, I hated her early (I kt'ed her and ditched her) but I picked her up again, tested more skills and now she is much more fun both time to hunt and shotgun build (I mostly use time to hunt cause the lack of skillpoints hurt)

Its really hard to know in advance, worst case you just ditch it and keep it for daily slave. I have 8 chars right now, 2 of them are stationary at 340, they don't even do gaurdians/chaos but they login daily for the 4 bifrost points to do me some work. One day I might delete them but for now they earn their keep
            how do you make 600 golds? currently at T1 and struggling to make even 20 gold per hour
                Selling all the tradeable matts on tradehouse you get nets you a lot. It probably comes out to about 1/4th of your total matts so it will increase the time it takes you to tier up a bit, but those matts won't be worth nearly as much for very long.

Chaos Gates give maps and these maps usually contain the fail% honing material and sometimes leapstones, which can be sold for a decent amount. Also can get skillbooks. If you manage to bid on the legendary map then you can probably sell the spots (haven't done this personally but the maps are usually about 2-3k atm in tier 2!).

Selling adventure tome consumables has net me a lot of $$. There is a limit to how many the whales will need to complete, so the matts for those should also eventually be cheaper.

All in all its slower progression in trade for more gold, which lets you buy the crystalline aura relatively easily. IMO it's worth doing for that alone as a free to play player.
                The "Chaos Gate" event can be done once a day per Roster, and at the end a Legendary Map is put up for bid; the 30 players involved in the Gate Event bid against each other and if you don't win it you get your share of the winning bid. I've seen a Map go for 7k Gold (>230 gold).

&#x200B;

Between this and selling unbound Stones from my T1 alts Guardian Raids (I only do them when I have the double harvest up) I would say I'm consistently making 400g a day for about an hours effort
            > tl;dr there is no reason to manually raise an alt unless you plan on making more than 12 characters

What about grinding for the Lostwind Cliff set?
                Remind me again, isn't that the set that drops from abyss? I don't recall any way to farm this up by 1-50 leveling
With just 600 gold you can do knowledge transfer and get your character to lvl 50 with vern quest done.
really stupid idea, though. powerpasses have a timelimit and so far all newly released classes came with a pass in the other regions
    Wait they have a time limit? I honestly had no idea well I guess I have to use my second one now
        They don't have time limit once you claim them, you can just save them, Chech the top right corner in server select and it tells you that you have a powerpass available in your server with no time limit
        They don‚Äôt have a time limit. They can be held for as long as you need them.
    On the login screen it shows there is not a time limit when you have one avalible.
        then they must have removed it, i am sure my tickets on ru had them and i have seen others talk about it too when west released. nvm then
gj for the minus IQ play, you not only have wasted gold you also slowed down your mains progeess, cuz you get a free char slot and punika boost with all the classes coming out for free and a gearing even too
that's true, i used powerpass and i feel so disconnected from my class abilities. reading 20 abilities that all say " does 2000 damage" and 100+ perks at once doesn't really work.Shooting them at random during chaos dungeon isn't working out either because the party overshadows you.

that said the campaign is horribly long and you rarely fight, so it truly is a bit too much for the purpose.I gladly go through the 6-8 hours super linear and fight-filled campaign in Path Of Exile everytime, but Lost Ark questing an entire continent a second time can't be digested as easily.
if only msq wasnt sooooo long and forced , outside annika u cant skip anything afaik.

i hated leveling alts on FFXIV because was boring w/o quests or repeating msq ...but oh boy now i understand why.
    The sad thing is that you spend more time running around NOT killing monsters, I cleared all quests on my main and really wasn't feeling like this was a combat game. I don't think I can face the "plot" more than once.
[deleted]
    So playing a class more doesn't teach you how to play a class?  I never said it was the only way to learn, but playing with the abilities as they come can show you what works well as the game progresses.

There's not really a wrong way to do it, powerpass or level.  Depends on what the player enjoys and how much time they have.
Getting used to a powerpassed alt... I felt like I might've just leveled it up on the story lol.
Yeah guys mobile gamers lives matter damn
It‚Äôs essentially a boost. The only one that is actually worth it is the lvl 10-50 boost. You can only skip story sections past 50. So if have a tier one char I can‚Äôt boost the ilvl with it. But once I get to 600 you can use knowledge transfer to skip the story.

This process also takes 8 hours it isn‚Äôt instant. All these reasons are why the 10-50 is the only one actually worth it.
    so with that can i move my level 52 and gearscore 960 to another class if i wanna play something different?
wut? You have 9 knowledge transfers available. You level one main + 2 free power passes + 9 knowledge and you are at 12 characters already. If you are a masochist and want all classes you just need to level up 3 of them.
    You can only knowledge transfer based on how many you have done Vern with, and knowledge transferred characters don't count. So first character and 2 power passes allows you 3 knowledge transfers.
    [deleted]
        You get 9 Vern knowledge transfers for finishing the Vern story once.
Why would you want to make 15 classes? You have to pay real money btw to unlock more char slots.
    Because no life, what else you gonna do
        Get to tier 3? Do endgame content? Farm gold? Explore other places? There much things to do instead of just going trough a lot of chars from 10 to 50 XD
            Knowledge transfer them all, literally 0 need to level again
I have 1 Artillerist, 1 Deadeye, 1 Striker, 1 Gunlancer, 1 Bard, 1 Gunslinger and 6 Paladins. I leveled all of those characters from scratch except for 5 Paladins which are Transfer Knowledge and the Gunlancer and Bard which are Powerpasses.
I kinda wish there was no cap, same with friends list I don't understand why there is a cap. Maybe its a limitation I just have no idea about?
Welp then I guess it's capped lolol I know I've definitely reported 200+. At one point I needed a break from doing collectibles and island and just city/channel hopped with the sole purpose of reporting for a sold hour.
Wanting to play through the story again is a completely valid reason to do so, but just an FYI that the Vern transfer is special and unlocks 9x by completing the story on just one character. You can get 12 L50 characters with only one manually leveled, two powerpassed, and nine knowledge transfers.
I mean those who teleport leveling / farming via bot and don't chat spam :(
    Oh yeah, tricker those!  I'll be logging or mining and see hundreds run by, I guess there's not an easy way to report them as they are gone so fast, and teleport on the run.  Hope today really does help.
And the other 10% are sorc
Paladin underrated
That includes the zerker I matched with in Abyssal last night, right? Right? :(
> but not killing the mobs lol

O-our damage is fine!
The sadistic part of me loves the thought of a script banning someone in Lost Ark and then another banning them on reddit for crying about it.
    Sounds like satan
The good ole jmod smackdown
Yeah because people on the internet never lie.

I don't believe AGS will not mistaken ban people but at the same time I don't trust people to not lie about the reason why they get banned, too.

Lose lose situation.
    AGS will definitely mistakenly ban people. It's a given it happens with every ban wave and every autoban system. At the same time people are definately gonna lie because nobody is gonna admit they're a botter and a gold seller who spams area chat.  


I think the ban wave will do more good for the game but hopefully support can address the people who were mistakenly banned and unban them in a timely manner and hopefully the autoban is a decent bit accurate as to not ban a ton of legitimate people
        > I think the ban wave will do more good for the game 

I haven't been back to the starting areas yet but it hasn't really lessened the gold selling spam at all.

The issue with free to play games is that it costs the gold sellers nothing to make a new account, it's the flaw in the model.

Charge $10 for the game and you lessen that quite a bit.
    I've got false ban for trade macro in a god-damn EvE just a month ago. Got 15 days Omega for free and personal email with apology from Senior GM. 

I know 10 years old youtube channel with thousands of videos and in total millions of views that got deleted, because strike bot fucked up and strike the same video three times (in row), that was manually checked as OK. This was the first time I saw a machine take the live hood of a man and get him on the bring of suicide.  Not a SINGLE person looked into it. 

It happens a lot, when everything is checked by algorithm without human inputs.

Amazon has a receipt for people being banned for no reason in their games, just by chatting or fishing. FFS, they couldn't even be bothered to prevent client input (TEXT INPUT!) fucking with other clients. Why would I give any benefit of the doubt to these lazy wankers...

It's always the righteous that screams first when they get on the bad side...
        I'm perfectly aware that false positive bans can, will, and have happened.

But like I said, people also like to lie about reasons why they get banned, too.
Yeah trust the whole wave of people coincidentally whining about it during bot ban waves, good call.
    I‚Äôm more likely to believe someone who claims to have been erroneously caught up in a bot ban-wave than I am to believe someone who claims to have been erroneously banned in a lone hit.
        I'm more likely to believe it's people just not accepting consequences.  Speaking as someone that has (and still does) lost more than a couple accounts (rightfully so) in ban waves.
    Well there will be false positives, so an influx of complaints when a ban wave hits kind of makes sense
    At this point I really hope you get wrongfully banned so I can throw your post right at you and laugh.
    When you ban 1m accounts at the same time then yeah you get everyone whining at the same time.

I wouldn't be surprised if they just did something like banning everyone who got reported more than 3 times or something like that lol.
    i guess you never played NW or read about it
    If it was any other publisher.. yeah, but we talking AGS.
    If it were anyone but Amazon lol.
Why? Amazon is good at customer service. It is employees they have a record of not treating well.
Have you, brother, seen AGS support?
> tbh, until AG is able to provide proof or specific infos about bans

That's something all games do though, not specific to Lost Ark or AGS.
>players that comlain about false bans should get the benefit of the doubt.

Not really since this has happened A LOT in online games and it easily ends up being revealed that they did deserve the ban.
    Except most cases so far seem to imply Amazons support is incompetent. They've acknowledged that they have incorrectly banned people via the commerce ban already.

Edit: Proof of acknowledgement by them since everyone seems to be jumping to Amazons defence with 0 clue what they are talking about.

Support says it's affecting multiple people and should be fixed all at once.
        and then they said all those bans are rmt bans and everyone i know that got banned did in fact rmt.
            No they never, stop talking shit.

2 giant threads where roxx asked people for their names to help them out, both with dozens of people proving they didn't refund anything. She also said the team are investigating it.

https://forums.playlostark.com/t/another-permabanned-thread/229785

https://forums.playlostark.com/t/commerce-lock-ban-permanent/229396

Both of these threads have numerous examples of their support being provided with evidence of no refunds and continuing to say there was a refund, while asking for the evidence they had already been provided.

The fact that your 2 friends RMT and got banned for it is irrelevant.
                https://forums.playlostark.com/t/banned-for-purchasing-skin-from-ah/229315/71

You are on the 3rd stage of grief.  Anger. You or your friend cheated and bought gold, the account is never coming back.  I don't believe you didn't RMT and i really don't care about what excuse you come up with next.
                    Most people that claim to be falsely banned deserve it but what about the ones that didn't? Fuck 'em for being unlucky?

False positives happen and I sincerely hope one day you'll get caught in one.
                        The thing is they are all getting banned for refunding, when 90% are able to provide proof they didn't.

If they are being banned for RMTing that should be the reason they are banned and supplied with but it's not. Prior poster is just a dipshit.
                    I haven't been banned, your dumb fucking assumptions further proving how much of a moron you are.

Even if your theoretical situation was true and all those people were banned for RMTing why is support still saying it's for a refund? Incompetent either way but go off, idiot.

"This is not a single issue affecting just you this will be fixed for everyone at once"
        They haven't acknowledged that they have incorrectly banned anyone, unless you're referring to something else than the OP.

As with every ban wave in every game there's going to be people complaining that they got unfairly banned. They are merely saying please direct those appeals to <<here>>. That doesn't mean that they knowingly falsely banned people at all
            I linked the threads further down.

Saying you are investigating every one of these bans and names would be helpful with that implies it's abit more than just "The norm." It is not normal for Community managers to get involved in the usual CS tickets.

That's without even mentioning that 90% of people in those threads provided proof they never refunded via screenshots of their steam history. There is LITERAL PROOF provided.

They are even warning that they are going to falsely ban people in the bot wave, enough so that they announced it. 

Some more proof -

Player Z - "I was flagged for my name but it is not offensive at all"

Yes I'm embellishing a little here, but it wasn't that far off.

Though to be fair there were actually one or two legit false flags. Like someone getting banned because of a report. But for the most part it was just glorious.
    ‚ÄúAll‚Äù of them? 100%?

Are you saying the dev responded to every complaint and proved each one was legit? Or is it possible that a decent number were mistakes, but you just didn‚Äôt notice that because it wasn‚Äôt as entertaining?

    No gold site. Had some experiences with AGs banning-behaviour prior to launch in the forum. After 90 days of activity and 5 days reading time (approaching launch) my more critical comments got deleted without any good reason and shortly after i got my permaban. And you neither know why or are able to fight that.

Of course its easy to assume that all of those people are guilty, as long as you are not the victim, but AG also has a bad history with automated bans in New World too.
And with the last wave of complains CMs admitted that there were a good amount of false bans, what at the same time proves, that they were lying for weeks now with denying that automated bans happen without any employee in between.
That they are not providing prove is as much a problem for them, as it is for the players and Community,because nobody knows if they are valid.
        > And you neither know why or are able to fight that.

That's how things work everywhere though.
            >That's how things work everywhere though.

So thats fine and okay? Wouldnt care about a plattform, where i never did spend a penny (So i dont care about the forum a lot tbh), but when people got falsly banned in a game where they already spend a lot of money, it is problematic.
                > So thats fine and okay?

Yes? Not sure what kind of answer you are looking for here.

> but when people got falsly banned in a game where they already spend a lot of money, it is problematic.

I don't think I said otherwise, when it comes to people who actually got wrongfully banned.

I just said these companies don't disclose the reason/why/where/when/how a person got banned for. That's information cheat makers can use to improve their cheats.
                    Yeah, i guess the info "banned for name XY", showing the accusations of reports or specify what their systems thought, what happened, like for RMT "got X amount of gold from bot Srdfgionuze", is something those botters will have the info from, to improve their cheats. I mean, realy? They dont need to show the code of their auto-ban-systems, but provide simple info, where people are A: able to prove if they are falsly banned or B: pay more attention on, when its just a timeban for "inappropriate behaviour" or some sort of combination of letters, that could be missinterpreted in names.

Not to mention that botters wouldnt care at all. Thats a Free2Play-game. They just make another Account and start from the beginning. Thats also why the ban-wave that got announced wont have a large impact on bots at all. But there will be false bans and i think there will be a lot of them.
Found the botter
It's tough because the more information AG provides, the more information botters have to work with to avoid automated bans.  Honestly I'm unsure what the correct balance is, but I do think the emphasis should be on not falsely banning legitimate players rather than on catching every bot.

autoclicker that try to get around queue deserve a ban just as much as bots
    [deleted]
        not really. making everyone else suffer because you are too entitled to sit in queue yourself is just as bad as chinese bot farmers. 

but okay, just make it a 1 year ban instead of permanent.

lmao fishing mini game = good game, no fishing mini game = bad game.
I haven‚Äôt done any scripts lol, but to the game it might look like it
    it wont look like it unless you have the same delay everytime u fish or something
        Oh yeah I guess that‚Äôs true, since the fishing timing isn‚Äôt the same every time I should be good then! Plus I failed to catch the fish sometimes during good parts of my shows lol
They're speed hacking, they're tele hacking, and they're noclip hacking.  
  
EAC isn't doing much :p
    true, after all, it's called easy anti cheat because it's easy to bypass
Editing character movespeed in RAM and bad server-side checks that don't catch it (or maybe they do but they don't instaban)
    Insta banning is bad because it just lets script programmers trial and error their hacks
        [deleted]
            I‚Äôm not proud of this but I developed botting scripts for another popular MMO and the most frustrating thing with the development process was trialing a new script I wrote, seeing it work for a few days, then having the account banned after a couple days. Was it the amount of time played? Hours played per day? IP address? Specific problem with the script that could be auto detected? Was I reported by a player? 

All of those questions are unknowns because it was impossible to pin down exactly what triggered the ban. And the feedback loop to improve the botting script would take multiple days just to realize it needed further updating.  If instabanning was utilized, I would‚Äôve known exactly what caused my bots to get caught, and I would ALSO have a very good understanding of how their bot detection system works. Part of the beauty of not getting instabanned is the mental game it puts on botters and bot devs. We don‚Äôt know precisely how the bot detection system works, so as a result all the ‚Äúanti-detection techniques‚Äù that we cake into our scripts is purely conjecture and rumor for how we think the bot detection system works. These smoke and mirrors effects would evaporate the second instabanning is implemented.

Hopefully this provides some insight into why instabanning is not the ultimate solution that you might (logically) assume it to be.
            If you let botters trial and error hacks it would become much, much worse than the situation you described.

You might not be aware but your opinion on the matter is siding with and supporting the botters.

                    it's not about winning, it's about doing the better option.

instantly banning is the worse option.
I don't think those posters are misunderstanding, I think they're the gold buyers.
    Probably.
[deleted]
    They both said they would have spent almost 250$ on gold to get to where they are
What‚Äôs sad is it‚Äôs not even hard to make gold at t3. My guild lead has 5k crystals and 125k gold. I made 13k in 3hr
I'm sorry officer, I didn't know I couldn't do that.
People are listing them for 30-50k sometimes more. No one is buying them. You search sold items and what they sold for. The highest accessory I saw was like 25k a few days ago. Most good items were selling around 10k there was less than half a page that sold for over 10k. I am referring to useable gear (accessories) only.

Perma ban or temp?
Silver is the cap, ive been in tatters rerolling my gems.
    I think you can convert gold to silver at an npc
        The ratio is ghastly, 1k gold equals 100k silver. Thats 3 gem reforges @ 36k a pop.
            reforging a gem is basically always a mistake. Just sell the one you dont want and buy the one you want.
                There is some skills that just dont sell. Ive gotten hook chain 4 times in a row xd.

I can give SS of payment for gold too lmao. Trust me they are banning slowly... Very few people will come clean about it and heck I learned my lesson and playing clean now. Much more relaxed too. Also in forum post, roxx did say a lot of the people trying to appeal for the refund bans going around, were trying to sneak in and actually got caught buying gold. They are permanently banning gold buyers lmao. But who would admit it? And plus the sellers aren't bothered if buyers banned. They get more, sell more, space it between many accounts, etc. So obviously it isn't slowing anything down. But it is true amazon is banning people. Nobody will show you this though, why would they shame themselves? Yeah some will always get through the cracks. But if my 100k one time payment got me banned and 100k barely makes a difference end game... I can imagine people buying more could be tracked fairly easily too.
    What time were you exactly banned at? Also did you buy it from a site posted in chat?
        Didnt use a chat advertised place, but I'd assume those are riskier. It took 9 days to get banned after buying. I assume if the seller gets banned for it on a storage account, they track those who stuff was sent to. Thus i got hit. Its cat and mouse, but at least they are slowly working on it.
            Thanks for the incite. Looks like I‚Äôll prob get hit then with a ban. If I don‚Äôt by some miracle I‚Äôll stop buying gold. GodSpeed.
                Some will always slip through. You may be fine. But in the end it isn't worth it. In the moment it feels great. But there's people who spend $20,000 and then it devalues fast. Plus after Argos we may get t3 boosts or honing boosts. Its just...not worth it.. i regret personally. Hopefully you'll be fine, but i now stand with others in being against it. Since it devalues so quickly, the only thing its doing is raising crystal prices which hurts all.
    Cool, time to start spending 70 cents to get a "present" delivered to assholes in chat.
Everything is logged in servers. Its not like they checked me for no reason. My guess is the seller got caught, and traced to me when it happened. Or something flagged them on my end and then a small investigation saw i got a mail of 100k gold by someone sending and receiving lots of gold. They wouldn't ban for no reason.
Nah this appears to be fine. My bf has been sending me his overflow of T1 materials and extra gold (he just loves the cute outfits on my sorc so it‚Äôs been a bit of extra gold to fund skins lmao) and I haven‚Äôt been hit with a ban hammer. I‚Äôll edit this post if I do, but so far so good! I‚Äôve even been purchasing lawmaker/platinum skins off the market too so ü§ûü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

This isnt accurate as im in the scene and have personally been shown this. 6 bots use more than 32gb ram and nobody is using servers for these currently as they lack the support. Have friends in Chinese forums for this bot specifically. Maybe in the future but as of right now no. 6 windows use currently 36gb ram on lowest setting. I have friend showing with resource monitor open. And on top of that, it currently does not allow multiple instances, only the built in multibox.
    why wouldn't a botter just invest in 64gb or even 128gb ram if it's their main income job?
So you're suggesting they should just sit and do nothing
    You ban buyers.

Sellers don't care if they get banned, it's bots, they don't get tired of farming and by the time you get them they already made money.

Buyers? Oh boy, they really don't want to get banned. Sure, some don't care since they will just whale a new account, but most are not like that.

From the moment buying gold from bots gets risky people will stop doing it. It's not worth it.
        [deleted]
            Thing is they're not paying you right now but bots.
It‚Äôs almost always a losing battle unless irl action is taken.
Nah.
Yes. Jobs. Credit cards. Banks. All things that warrant the use of my SSN. A video game is not one of those.
    Then don't play I guess?

I personally hope games do adopt this eventually, or some way of tying identity to a game account.

It immediately gets rid of a large source of the botting plague as well as account selling.

It also is by far the most effective anti-cheat since you can't just make another throwaway account easily.
"illegitimate bot accounts" and people buying gold from them are two very different things. No one buying rmt gold got banned in the other regions, they just got sent into the negative for the gold they bought, say -20k. 

I feel this punishment is effective enough as it would really suck to have happen but you'd still be able to play at least. They'd probably bank on people buying from the cash shop to level their negative balance.
    Haha whatever.

I didn't expect anything else than a bunch of degenerate clowns buying gold with real money from chinese bots while photographing their monitor to show off with that dank T3 gear

So many downvotes by idiots crying about bots but then buy gold from them. You guys are the reason why this world is fu**ed
Thats just the real world with extra steps.
    But *Inside* your own home!
You want a Disneyland MMO?
Something like that has been announced, check out "War of Dragnorox". Personally, I don't think this game is going anywhere though.
Flashback to college days when there was always somebody evangelizing in a prominent speaker's circle...
Very clever.
i was eating at benihanas and the chef whispered in my ear if i wanted to buy 1k gold for 80 cents
sometimes they spam as soon as you join the area, they might have some tools to know all the players in the area and spam them all
i like leveling, its chill mindless gaming when i just wanna relax.
    I normally do to, but it's just too much click/G spam for me, with mediocre quests, a not very interesting storyline that's got a mediocre translation (Why are there so many inconsistencies in how something is translated? Why do subtitles not match the voice acting? And it seemingly only gets worse the further in I go. Can definitely tell it was translated by a group of people that did not communicate with each other very much. But enough of me ranting about the translation quality).

The main saving grace is the dungeons, and a few points in the story (namely the sieges), which is a shame, as this is otherwise a very good game.

So yeah, given the choice, I'd definitely choose skip as much as humanly possible every time myself.

Anyway, sorry for this way too long reply to just a simple message about how you enjoy leveling. Guess I just needed to get this off my chest. I love this game, but oh boy is the story a chore to get through.
        If you pay attention you can see changes and improvements every play-through. As far the subtitles go they are often more up-to-date and accurate than the voice lines so hopefully they rerecord those later.

Localization work is actually hard and tedious. It is also all done blind so not every translator is aware of what everyone else is doing and this is no doubt made much worse by the lack of in-office interactions. Also the toolset is often really clunky which makes iteration slow.

As long as they continue to clean things up each maintenance it will get better fairly quickly.
Also I know lots of ppl are sick of the storylines but I just love it. Still working on my main and powerpassed two alts but I can't wait to redo the story. I can't get enough
    I bought a new switch and cap for the G key, so now I can level at least two more chars before I need more replacement parts
    I don't find the story that good to be honest, I don't want to waste like 20 hours doing the story again. But each person with their own things.
        I mean honestly its nice that they even provide an avenue at all to fast track  alternate characters for free. Most games would just have you level from scratch again or pay money to fast track through the story
            This game has to be the most respectful game out right now. They understand convenience doesn't have to be a commodity that is bought and sold.
    I‚Äôm glad someone likes it
And dont you have to get to luterra to use KT?

That costs a shit ton of gold that people don't have this early unless whaling.
    If 600 gold is a shit ton to you we are playing very different games
        I legit got 10k in one day in T2 (granted I ran 2 legendary maps, but still)
    ?????? 600 is a shit ton of gold? Any lvl 50 char can make at t1 as much in WAY less time than the time you waste by lvling 50 chars.

You are literally wasting progress if you don't KT with no exceptions. The time you waste to level up accounts could be used top farm multiple times this gold and/or progress


tl;dr there is no reason to manually raise an alt unless you plan on making more than 12 characters
        I level mine manually so i can try the class. Instead of wasting my powerpass or gold in something i dont like. If i end up not liking more than 6 classes ill just repeat my main with power pass.
            Problem is that you cant possibly know that until you reach endgame.

I was leveling soulfist and felt so fun but on actual bossing with actual skillset I just don't like her. Nothing wrong with her I'm not going to complain its just not for me

On the contrary gunslinger, I hated her early (I kt'ed her and ditched her) but I picked her up again, tested more skills and now she is much more fun both time to hunt and shotgun build (I mostly use time to hunt cause the lack of skillpoints hurt)

Its really hard to know in advance, worst case you just ditch it and keep it for daily slave. I have 8 chars right now, 2 of them are stationary at 340, they don't even do gaurdians/chaos but they login daily for the 4 bifrost points to do me some work. One day I might delete them but for now they earn their keep
        how do you make 600 golds? currently at T1 and struggling to make even 20 gold per hour
            Selling all the tradeable matts on tradehouse you get nets you a lot. It probably comes out to about 1/4th of your total matts so it will increase the time it takes you to tier up a bit, but those matts won't be worth nearly as much for very long.

Chaos Gates give maps and these maps usually contain the fail% honing material and sometimes leapstones, which can be sold for a decent amount. Also can get skillbooks. If you manage to bid on the legendary map then you can probably sell the spots (haven't done this personally but the maps are usually about 2-3k atm in tier 2!).

Selling adventure tome consumables has net me a lot of $$. There is a limit to how many the whales will need to complete, so the matts for those should also eventually be cheaper.

All in all its slower progression in trade for more gold, which lets you buy the crystalline aura relatively easily. IMO it's worth doing for that alone as a free to play player.
            The "Chaos Gate" event can be done once a day per Roster, and at the end a Legendary Map is put up for bid; the 30 players involved in the Gate Event bid against each other and if you don't win it you get your share of the winning bid. I've seen a Map go for 7k Gold (>230 gold).

&#x200B;

Between this and selling unbound Stones from my T1 alts Guardian Raids (I only do them when I have the double harvest up) I would say I'm consistently making 400g a day for about an hours effort
        > tl;dr there is no reason to manually raise an alt unless you plan on making more than 12 characters

What about grinding for the Lostwind Cliff set?
            Remind me again, isn't that the set that drops from abyss? I don't recall any way to farm this up by 1-50 leveling
Wait they have a time limit? I honestly had no idea well I guess I have to use my second one now
    They don't have time limit once you claim them, you can just save them, Chech the top right corner in server select and it tells you that you have a powerpass available in your server with no time limit
    They don‚Äôt have a time limit. They can be held for as long as you need them.
On the login screen it shows there is not a time limit when you have one avalible.
    then they must have removed it, i am sure my tickets on ru had them and i have seen others talk about it too when west released. nvm then
The sad thing is that you spend more time running around NOT killing monsters, I cleared all quests on my main and really wasn't feeling like this was a combat game. I don't think I can face the "plot" more than once.
So playing a class more doesn't teach you how to play a class?  I never said it was the only way to learn, but playing with the abilities as they come can show you what works well as the game progresses.

There's not really a wrong way to do it, powerpass or level.  Depends on what the player enjoys and how much time they have.
so with that can i move my level 52 and gearscore 960 to another class if i wanna play something different?
You can only knowledge transfer based on how many you have done Vern with, and knowledge transferred characters don't count. So first character and 2 power passes allows you 3 knowledge transfers.
[deleted]
    You get 9 Vern knowledge transfers for finishing the Vern story once.
Because no life, what else you gonna do
    Get to tier 3? Do endgame content? Farm gold? Explore other places? There much things to do instead of just going trough a lot of chars from 10 to 50 XD
        Knowledge transfer them all, literally 0 need to level again
Oh yeah, tricker those!  I'll be logging or mining and see hundreds run by, I guess there's not an easy way to report them as they are gone so fast, and teleport on the run.  Hope today really does help.
Sounds like satan
AGS will definitely mistakenly ban people. It's a given it happens with every ban wave and every autoban system. At the same time people are definately gonna lie because nobody is gonna admit they're a botter and a gold seller who spams area chat.  


I think the ban wave will do more good for the game but hopefully support can address the people who were mistakenly banned and unban them in a timely manner and hopefully the autoban is a decent bit accurate as to not ban a ton of legitimate people
    > I think the ban wave will do more good for the game 

I haven't been back to the starting areas yet but it hasn't really lessened the gold selling spam at all.

The issue with free to play games is that it costs the gold sellers nothing to make a new account, it's the flaw in the model.

Charge $10 for the game and you lessen that quite a bit.
I've got false ban for trade macro in a god-damn EvE just a month ago. Got 15 days Omega for free and personal email with apology from Senior GM. 

I know 10 years old youtube channel with thousands of videos and in total millions of views that got deleted, because strike bot fucked up and strike the same video three times (in row), that was manually checked as OK. This was the first time I saw a machine take the live hood of a man and get him on the bring of suicide.  Not a SINGLE person looked into it. 

It happens a lot, when everything is checked by algorithm without human inputs.

Amazon has a receipt for people being banned for no reason in their games, just by chatting or fishing. FFS, they couldn't even be bothered to prevent client input (TEXT INPUT!) fucking with other clients. Why would I give any benefit of the doubt to these lazy wankers...

It's always the righteous that screams first when they get on the bad side...
    I'm perfectly aware that false positive bans can, will, and have happened.

But like I said, people also like to lie about reasons why they get banned, too.
I‚Äôm more likely to believe someone who claims to have been erroneously caught up in a bot ban-wave than I am to believe someone who claims to have been erroneously banned in a lone hit.
    I'm more likely to believe it's people just not accepting consequences.  Speaking as someone that has (and still does) lost more than a couple accounts (rightfully so) in ban waves.
Well there will be false positives, so an influx of complaints when a ban wave hits kind of makes sense
At this point I really hope you get wrongfully banned so I can throw your post right at you and laugh.
When you ban 1m accounts at the same time then yeah you get everyone whining at the same time.

I wouldn't be surprised if they just did something like banning everyone who got reported more than 3 times or something like that lol.
i guess you never played NW or read about it
If it was any other publisher.. yeah, but we talking AGS.
If it were anyone but Amazon lol.
Except most cases so far seem to imply Amazons support is incompetent. They've acknowledged that they have incorrectly banned people via the commerce ban already.

    and then they said all those bans are rmt bans and everyone i know that got banned did in fact rmt.
        No they never, stop talking shit.

2 giant threads where roxx asked people for their names to help them out, both with dozens of people proving they didn't refund anything. She also said the team are investigating it.

Both of these threads have numerous examples of their support being provided with evidence of no refunds and continuing to say there was a refund, while asking for the evidence they had already been provided.

The fact that your 2 friends RMT and got banned for it is irrelevant.
            https://forums.playlostark.com/t/banned-for-purchasing-skin-from-ah/229315/71

You are on the 3rd stage of grief.  Anger. You or your friend cheated and bought gold, the account is never coming back.  I don't believe you didn't RMT and i really don't care about what excuse you come up with next.
                Most people that claim to be falsely banned deserve it but what about the ones that didn't? Fuck 'em for being unlucky?

False positives happen and I sincerely hope one day you'll get caught in one.
                    The thing is they are all getting banned for refunding, when 90% are able to provide proof they didn't.

If they are being banned for RMTing that should be the reason they are banned and supplied with but it's not. Prior poster is just a dipshit.
                I haven't been banned, your dumb fucking assumptions further proving how much of a moron you are.

Even if your theoretical situation was true and all those people were banned for RMTing why is support still saying it's for a refund? Incompetent either way but go off, idiot.

    They haven't acknowledged that they have incorrectly banned anyone, unless you're referring to something else than the OP.

As with every ban wave in every game there's going to be people complaining that they got unfairly banned. They are merely saying please direct those appeals to <<here>>. That doesn't mean that they knowingly falsely banned people at all
        I linked the threads further down.

Saying you are investigating every one of these bans and names would be helpful with that implies it's abit more than just "The norm." It is not normal for Community managers to get involved in the usual CS tickets.

That's without even mentioning that 90% of people in those threads provided proof they never refunded via screenshots of their steam history. There is LITERAL PROOF provided.

They are even warning that they are going to falsely ban people in the bot wave, enough so that they announced it.

Yes I'm embellishing a little here, but it wasn't that far off.

Though to be fair there were actually one or two legit false flags. Like someone getting banned because of a report. But for the most part it was just glorious.
‚ÄúAll‚Äù of them? 100%?

Are you saying the dev responded to every complaint and proved each one was legit? Or is it possible that a decent number were mistakes, but you just didn‚Äôt notice that because it wasn‚Äôt as entertaining?

I don't think I said otherwise, when it comes to people who actually got wrongfully banned.

I just said these companies don't disclose the reason/why/where/when/how a person got banned for. That's information cheat makers can use to improve their cheats.
                Yeah, i guess the info "banned for name XY", showing the accusations of reports or specify what their systems thought, what happened, like for RMT "got X amount of gold from bot Srdfgionuze", is something those botters will have the info from, to improve their cheats. I mean, realy? They dont need to show the code of their auto-ban-systems, but provide simple info, where people are A: able to prove if they are falsly banned or B: pay more attention on, when its just a timeban for "inappropriate behaviour" or some sort of combination of letters, that could be missinterpreted in names.

Not to mention that botters wouldnt care at all. Thats a Free2Play-game. They just make another Account and start from the beginning. Thats also why the ban-wave that got announced wont have a large impact on bots at all. But there will be false bans and i think there will be a lot of them.

    not really. making everyone else suffer because you are too entitled to sit in queue yourself is just as bad as chinese bot farmers. 

but okay, just make it a 1 year ban instead of permanent.

                    Except you weren't playing, you were sitting in a city doing nothing while an auto clicker kept you in the game
it wont look like it unless you have the same delay everytime u fish or something
    Oh yeah I guess that‚Äôs true, since the fishing timing isn‚Äôt the same every time I should be good then! Plus I failed to catch the fish sometimes during good parts of my shows lol
true, after all, it's called easy anti cheat because it's easy to bypass
Insta banning is bad because it just lets script programmers trial and error their hacks
    [deleted]
        I‚Äôm not proud of this but I developed botting scripts for another popular MMO and the most frustrating thing with the development process was trialing a new script I wrote, seeing it work for a few days, then having the account banned after a couple days. Was it the amount of time played? Hours played per day? IP address? Specific problem with the script that could be auto detected? Was I reported by a player? 

All of those questions are unknowns because it was impossible to pin down exactly what triggered the ban. And the feedback loop to improve the botting script would take multiple days just to realize it needed further updating.  If instabanning was utilized, I would‚Äôve known exactly what caused my bots to get caught, and I would ALSO have a very good understanding of how their bot detection system works. Part of the beauty of not getting instabanned is the mental game it puts on botters and bot devs. We don‚Äôt know precisely how the bot detection system works, so as a result all the ‚Äúanti-detection techniques‚Äù that we cake into our scripts is purely conjecture and rumor for how we think the bot detection system works. These smoke and mirrors effects would evaporate the second instabanning is implemented.

Hopefully this provides some insight into why instabanning is not the ultimate solution that you might (logically) assume it to be.
        If you let botters trial and error hacks it would become much, much worse than the situation you described.

You might not be aware but your opinion on the matter is siding with and supporting the botters.

                it's not about winning, it's about doing the better option.

instantly banning is the worse option.
Probably.
They both said they would have spent almost 250$ on gold to get to where they are
I think you can convert gold to silver at an npc
    The ratio is ghastly, 1k gold equals 100k silver. Thats 3 gem reforges @ 36k a pop.
        reforging a gem is basically always a mistake. Just sell the one you dont want and buy the one you want.
            There is some skills that just dont sell. Ive gotten hook chain 4 times in a row xd.
What time were you exactly banned at? Also did you buy it from a site posted in chat?
    Didnt use a chat advertised place, but I'd assume those are riskier. It took 9 days to get banned after buying. I assume if the seller gets banned for it on a storage account, they track those who stuff was sent to. Thus i got hit. Its cat and mouse, but at least they are slowly working on it.
        Thanks for the incite. Looks like I‚Äôll prob get hit then with a ban. If I don‚Äôt by some miracle I‚Äôll stop buying gold. GodSpeed.
            Some will always slip through. You may be fine. But in the end it isn't worth it. In the moment it feels great. But there's people who spend $20,000 and then it devalues fast. Plus after Argos we may get t3 boosts or honing boosts. Its just...not worth it.. i regret personally. Hopefully you'll be fine, but i now stand with others in being against it. Since it devalues so quickly, the only thing its doing is raising crystal prices which hurts all.
Cool, time to start spending 70 cents to get a "present" delivered to assholes in chat.
why wouldn't a botter just invest in 64gb or even 128gb ram if it's their main income job?
You ban buyers.

Sellers don't care if they get banned, it's bots, they don't get tired of farming and by the time you get them they already made money.

Buyers? Oh boy, they really don't want to get banned. Sure, some don't care since they will just whale a new account, but most are not like that.

From the moment buying gold from bots gets risky people will stop doing it. It's not worth it.
    [deleted]
        Thing is they're not paying you right now but bots.
Then don't play I guess?

I personally hope games do adopt this eventually, or some way of tying identity to a game account.

It immediately gets rid of a large source of the botting plague as well as account selling.

It also is by far the most effective anti-cheat since you can't just make another throwaway account easily.
Haha whatever.

I didn't expect anything else than a bunch of degenerate clowns buying gold with real money from chinese bots while photographing their monitor to show off with that dank T3 gear

So many downvotes by idiots crying about bots but then buy gold from them. You guys are the reason why this world is fu**ed
But *Inside* your own home!
I normally do to, but it's just too much click/G spam for me, with mediocre quests, a not very interesting storyline that's got a mediocre translation (Why are there so many inconsistencies in how something is translated? Why do subtitles not match the voice acting? And it seemingly only gets worse the further in I go. Can definitely tell it was translated by a group of people that did not communicate with each other very much. But enough of me ranting about the translation quality).

The main saving grace is the dungeons, and a few points in the story (namely the sieges), which is a shame, as this is otherwise a very good game.

So yeah, given the choice, I'd definitely choose skip as much as humanly possible every time myself.

Anyway, sorry for this way too long reply to just a simple message about how you enjoy leveling. Guess I just needed to get this off my chest. I love this game, but oh boy is the story a chore to get through.
    If you pay attention you can see changes and improvements every play-through. As far the subtitles go they are often more up-to-date and accurate than the voice lines so hopefully they rerecord those later.

Localization work is actually hard and tedious. It is also all done blind so not every translator is aware of what everyone else is doing and this is no doubt made much worse by the lack of in-office interactions. Also the toolset is often really clunky which makes iteration slow.

As long as they continue to clean things up each maintenance it will get better fairly quickly.
I bought a new switch and cap for the G key, so now I can level at least two more chars before I need more replacement parts
I don't find the story that good to be honest, I don't want to waste like 20 hours doing the story again. But each person with their own things.
    I mean honestly its nice that they even provide an avenue at all to fast track  alternate characters for free. Most games would just have you level from scratch again or pay money to fast track through the story
        This game has to be the most respectful game out right now. They understand convenience doesn't have to be a commodity that is bought and sold.
I‚Äôm glad someone likes it
Nope just need to unlock songs in prideholm
    If you join a/your guild you can right click your name in members and tp to stronghold as soon as you start

        ouch
If 600 gold is a shit ton to you we are playing very different games
    I legit got 10k in one day in T2 (granted I ran 2 legendary maps, but still)
?????? 600 is a shit ton of gold? Any lvl 50 char can make at t1 as much in WAY less time than the time you waste by lvling 50 chars.

You are literally wasting progress if you don't KT with no exceptions. The time you waste to level up accounts could be used top farm multiple times this gold and/or progress


tl;dr there is no reason to manually raise an alt unless you plan on making more than 12 characters
    I level mine manually so i can try the class. Instead of wasting my powerpass or gold in something i dont like. If i end up not liking more than 6 classes ill just repeat my main with power pass.
        Problem is that you cant possibly know that until you reach endgame.

I was leveling soulfist and felt so fun but on actual bossing with actual skillset I just don't like her. Nothing wrong with her I'm not going to complain its just not for me

On the contrary gunslinger, I hated her early (I kt'ed her and ditched her) but I picked her up again, tested more skills and now she is much more fun both time to hunt and shotgun build (I mostly use time to hunt cause the lack of skillpoints hurt)

Its really hard to know in advance, worst case you just ditch it and keep it for daily slave. I have 8 chars right now, 2 of them are stationary at 340, they don't even do gaurdians/chaos but they login daily for the 4 bifrost points to do me some work. One day I might delete them but for now they earn their keep
    how do you make 600 golds? currently at T1 and struggling to make even 20 gold per hour
        Selling all the tradeable matts on tradehouse you get nets you a lot. It probably comes out to about 1/4th of your total matts so it will increase the time it takes you to tier up a bit, but those matts won't be worth nearly as much for very long.

Chaos Gates give maps and these maps usually contain the fail% honing material and sometimes leapstones, which can be sold for a decent amount. Also can get skillbooks. If you manage to bid on the legendary map then you can probably sell the spots (haven't done this personally but the maps are usually about 2-3k atm in tier 2!).

Selling adventure tome consumables has net me a lot of $$. There is a limit to how many the whales will need to complete, so the matts for those should also eventually be cheaper.

All in all its slower progression in trade for more gold, which lets you buy the crystalline aura relatively easily. IMO it's worth doing for that alone as a free to play player.
        The "Chaos Gate" event can be done once a day per Roster, and at the end a Legendary Map is put up for bid; the 30 players involved in the Gate Event bid against each other and if you don't win it you get your share of the winning bid. I've seen a Map go for 7k Gold (>230 gold).

&#x200B;

Between this and selling unbound Stones from my T1 alts Guardian Raids (I only do them when I have the double harvest up) I would say I'm consistently making 400g a day for about an hours effort
    > tl;dr there is no reason to manually raise an alt unless you plan on making more than 12 characters

What about grinding for the Lostwind Cliff set?
        Remind me again, isn't that the set that drops from abyss? I don't recall any way to farm this up by 1-50 leveling
They don't have time limit once you claim them, you can just save them, Chech the top right corner in server select and it tells you that you have a powerpass available in your server with no time limit
They don‚Äôt have a time limit. They can be held for as long as you need them.
then they must have removed it, i am sure my tickets on ru had them and i have seen others talk about it too when west released. nvm then
You get 9 Vern knowledge transfers for finishing the Vern story once.
Get to tier 3? Do endgame content? Farm gold? Explore other places? There much things to do instead of just going trough a lot of chars from 10 to 50 XD
    Knowledge transfer them all, literally 0 need to level again
> I think the ban wave will do more good for the game 

I haven't been back to the starting areas yet but it hasn't really lessened the gold selling spam at all.

The issue with free to play games is that it costs the gold sellers nothing to make a new account, it's the flaw in the model.

Charge $10 for the game and you lessen that quite a bit.
I'm perfectly aware that false positive bans can, will, and have happened.

But like I said, people also like to lie about reasons why they get banned, too.
I'm more likely to believe it's people just not accepting consequences.  Speaking as someone that has (and still does) lost more than a couple accounts (rightfully so) in ban waves.
and then they said all those bans are rmt bans and everyone i know that got banned did in fact rmt.
    No they never, stop talking shit.

        https://forums.playlostark.com/t/banned-for-purchasing-skin-from-ah/229315/71

You are on the 3rd stage of grief.  Anger. You or your friend cheated and bought gold, the account is never coming back.  I don't believe you didn't RMT and i really don't care about what excuse you come up with next.
            Most people that claim to be falsely banned deserve it but what about the ones that didn't? Fuck 'em for being unlucky?

False positives happen and I sincerely hope one day you'll get caught in one.
                The thing is they are all getting banned for refunding, when 90% are able to provide proof they didn't.

If they are being banned for RMTing that should be the reason they are banned and supplied with but it's not. Prior poster is just a dipshit.
            I haven't been banned, your dumb fucking assumptions further proving how much of a moron you are.

Even if your theoretical situation was true and all those people were banned for RMTing why is support still saying it's for a refund? Incompetent either way but go off, idiot.

They haven't acknowledged that they have incorrectly banned anyone, unless you're referring to something else than the OP.

As with every ban wave in every game there's going to be people complaining that they got unfairly banned. They are merely saying please direct those appeals to <<here>>. That doesn't mean that they knowingly falsely banned people at all
    I linked the threads further down.

Saying you are investigating every one of these bans and names would be helpful with that implies it's abit more than just "The norm." It is not normal for Community managers to get involved in the usual CS tickets.

That's without even mentioning that 90% of people in those threads provided proof they never refunded via screenshots of their steam history. There is LITERAL PROOF provided.

They are even warning that they are going to falsely ban people in the bot wave, enough so that they announced it.

I‚Äôm not proud of this but I developed botting scripts for another popular MMO and the most frustrating thing with the development process was trialing a new script I wrote, seeing it work for a few days, then having the account banned after a couple days. Was it the amount of time played? Hours played per day? IP address? Specific problem with the script that could be auto detected? Was I reported by a player? 

All of those questions are unknowns because it was impossible to pin down exactly what triggered the ban. And the feedback loop to improve the botting script would take multiple days just to realize it needed further updating.  If instabanning was utilized, I would‚Äôve known exactly what caused my bots to get caught, and I would ALSO have a very good understanding of how their bot detection system works. Part of the beauty of not getting instabanned is the mental game it puts on botters and bot devs. We don‚Äôt know precisely how the bot detection system works, so as a result all the ‚Äúanti-detection techniques‚Äù that we cake into our scripts is purely conjecture and rumor for how we think the bot detection system works. These smoke and mirrors effects would evaporate the second instabanning is implemented.

Hopefully this provides some insight into why instabanning is not the ultimate solution that you might (logically) assume it to be.
If you let botters trial and error hacks it would become much, much worse than the situation you described.

You might not be aware but your opinion on the matter is siding with and supporting the botters.

        it's not about winning, it's about doing the better option.

instantly banning is the worse option.
reforging a gem is basically always a mistake. Just sell the one you dont want and buy the one you want.
    There is some skills that just dont sell. Ive gotten hook chain 4 times in a row xd.
Thanks for the incite. Looks like I‚Äôll prob get hit then with a ban. If I don‚Äôt by some miracle I‚Äôll stop buying gold. GodSpeed.
    Some will always slip through. You may be fine. But in the end it isn't worth it. In the moment it feels great. But there's people who spend $20,000 and then it devalues fast. Plus after Argos we may get t3 boosts or honing boosts. Its just...not worth it.. i regret personally. Hopefully you'll be fine, but i now stand with others in being against it. Since it devalues so quickly, the only thing its doing is raising crystal prices which hurts all.
Thing is they're not paying you right now but bots.
This game has to be the most respectful game out right now. They understand convenience doesn't have to be a commodity that is bought and sold.
ouch
Problem is that you cant possibly know that until you reach endgame.

I was leveling soulfist and felt so fun but on actual bossing with actual skillset I just don't like her. Nothing wrong with her I'm not going to complain its just not for me

On the contrary gunslinger, I hated her early (I kt'ed her and ditched her) but I picked her up again, tested more skills and now she is much more fun both time to hunt and shotgun build (I mostly use time to hunt cause the lack of skillpoints hurt)

Its really hard to know in advance, worst case you just ditch it and keep it for daily slave. I have 8 chars right now, 2 of them are stationary at 340, they don't even do gaurdians/chaos but they login daily for the 4 bifrost points to do me some work. One day I might delete them but for now they earn their keep
Selling all the tradeable matts on tradehouse you get nets you a lot. It probably comes out to about 1/4th of your total matts so it will increase the time it takes you to tier up a bit, but those matts won't be worth nearly as much for very long.

Chaos Gates give maps and these maps usually contain the fail% honing material and sometimes leapstones, which can be sold for a decent amount. Also can get skillbooks. If you manage to bid on the legendary map then you can probably sell the spots (haven't done this personally but the maps are usually about 2-3k atm in tier 2!).

Selling adventure tome consumables has net me a lot of $$. There is a limit to how many the whales will need to complete, so the matts for those should also eventually be cheaper.

All in all its slower progression in trade for more gold, which lets you buy the crystalline aura relatively easily. IMO it's worth doing for that alone as a free to play player.
The "Chaos Gate" event can be done once a day per Roster, and at the end a Legendary Map is put up for bid; the 30 players involved in the Gate Event bid against each other and if you don't win it you get your share of the winning bid. I've seen a Map go for 7k Gold (>230 gold).

&#x200B;

Between this and selling unbound Stones from my T1 alts Guardian Raids (I only do them when I have the double harvest up) I would say I'm consistently making 400g a day for about an hours effort
Remind me again, isn't that the set that drops from abyss? I don't recall any way to farm this up by 1-50 leveling

You are on the 3rd stage of grief.  Anger. You or your friend cheated and bought gold, the account is never coming back.  I don't believe you didn't RMT and i really don't care about what excuse you come up with next.
    Most people that claim to be falsely banned deserve it but what about the ones that didn't? Fuck 'em for being unlucky?

False positives happen and I sincerely hope one day you'll get caught in one.
        The thing is they are all getting banned for refunding, when 90% are able to provide proof they didn't.

If they are being banned for RMTing that should be the reason they are banned and supplied with but it's not. Prior poster is just a dipshit.
    I haven't been banned, your dumb fucking assumptions further proving how much of a moron you are.

Even if your theoretical situation was true and all those people were banned for RMTing why is support still saying it's for a refund? Incompetent either way but go off, idiot.

Some more proof for you dumbass -

> So thats fine and okay?

Yes? Not sure what kind of answer you are looking for here.

> but when people got falsly banned in a game where they already spend a lot of money, it is problematic.

I don't think I said otherwise, when it comes to people who actually got wrongfully banned.

I just said these companies don't disclose the reason/why/where/when/how a person got banned for. That's information cheat makers can use to improve their cheats.
    Yeah, i guess the info "banned for name XY", showing the accusations of reports or specify what their systems thought, what happened, like for RMT "got X amount of gold from bot Srdfgionuze", is something those botters will have the info from, to improve their cheats. I mean, realy? They dont need to show the code of their auto-ban-systems, but provide simple info, where people are A: able to prove if they are falsly banned or B: pay more attention on, when its just a timeban for "inappropriate behaviour" or some sort of combination of letters, that could be missinterpreted in names.

Not to mention that botters wouldnt care at all. Thats a Free2Play-game. They just make another Account and start from the beginning. Thats also why the ban-wave that got announced wont have a large impact on bots at all. But there will be false bans and i think there will be a lot of them.
And with your actions someone else didn't get to play at all.
