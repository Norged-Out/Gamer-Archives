The Ark is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.
    Is it possible to learn this power?
        Not from a Priest
            Did YOU ever hear the Tragedy of ~~Darth~~ Armen the Delain?
                Too many times
                Surely you mean Armen the Killstealer
                Just got to that part a day or two ago. :( and I’m still not ok.
                I keep forgetting he ever existed.

                Hold up, that's some Red Alert 3 shit, and Putin is not nearly as funny as Tim Curry was.
        I swear to god I did have lower queue on that day.
    EU players summoned a primal.
    In all seriousness, I wonder if there's a chance the time during the day was changed on whatever was tracking players by world time. I work in a lab and have seen a triangular feature generate by changing the hour back for daylight savings time (eg if its 10 am, data for between 9am and 10 am is already recorded. After setting the time back an hour, the data is recorded again, generating multiple, in my case two, data points for x second within the hour. Both plot points are graphed and produced some interesting shapes)
        Can confirm. Not possible to replicated with daylight saving disabled.
        To me it looks like they added tracking servers in a different time zone then decommissioned the originals.

another drop of players caused by time travel....shame
I love how clear it is that Elden ring released on pc
    I bet 10+ days of constant log in queue and lag in EU have just as much or even more impact than Elden Ring release
        That and once you get to 50 and grind gems for a few days the game gets really boring.
            Gems start at tier 2 not level 50 what are you on about
            They hated him, for he spoke the truth
                Its all good, they can play this crap mobile  tier mmo.
    People are just quitting because the game is too hard for them. They're quitting Elden Ring too.
        I'd say it's rather tedious than hard
            A lot of the more casual players hit a wall when they need to do mechanics in dungeons.
                That's certainly true but I think a decent amount of casuals is starting to quit as they realise how much grinding is needed to progress
                    Yeah very true. I personally don't think the grind is too bad if you spread it out daily, but most people don't have the patience for that.
                        For me personally the grinding for gems is just to boring, I would much rather grind for gear drops in a traditional mmo.
                            You also grind for gear drops.  Getting good accessories and gear with the correct tripod levels is important.
                                It just doesn't feel the same... probably the camera perspective (I hate it) and the no holy trinity. Game just feels extremely boring.
                        I don’t mind the grind but there’s no way in hell you can even do certain dungeons with public groups anymore. I’m at the Rohendel abyss dungeons and I tried a public group and it’s just full wipe 3-4 times and I just gave up. 

You’re more or less forced to find a group to run end game(which is fine) but sometimes I don’t have enough players and one random is going to fuck up the run and kill your ENTIRE TEAM.
                            .
                                I didn’t even know that was a thing. Thank you! This’ll help
                                It's going from 9/10 parties wipe in matchmaking to like 6/10 parties wipe in party finder, it's still rough but much better overall.
                                    I think it's expected that mistakes will happen.. some of the mechanics are pretty unforgiving.

That said complexly being unaware of the mechanics won't ever work.
                            Rohendel abyss is very easy and honestly if you give up after 3-5 wipes, endgame raids arent for you.

In ru we wiped on the same boss for 6hours in a row so 🤷🏾‍♂️

You can teach the randoms
                                I didn’t say I gave up on the  dungeon. Just on the group I was with.
                                    That's the problem though with groups that quit after a few wipes, you are potentially resetting the progress you made by having new people that need a few wipes again to understand what's happening
                                    That’s exactly what i meant, if you can’t handle 4 wipes without changing the group you aren’t gonna go very far in endgame.

It’s better to take some time to discuss the strat even if you cannot teach it (like telling people where they can learn it).

Because chances are the next group isn’t gonna be any better anyway and with the current issues on matchmaking it’s a waste of time imo.

Have fun though ;)
Hope i didn’t sound like an ass

                            Even the old MMOs were grindfests. Hell, the old MMOs were bigger grindfests.

Runescape, Maplestory, Ragnarok, Ultima
                                Yea, as someone who played Ragnarok for years, I'll never understand the grind complaints in games like this. I don't get why people want to be done with the game in a month when it's an MMO.
                                    Even modern MMOs are grindy, or if not grindy they are time gated with how much you can do in a day/week.

FFXIV as great as it is, only has a few hours of non-side content per week after you're done progging the savage tier.
                I'm still low level and kinda new to MMOs - could you possibly elaborate on what you mean by "mechanics in dungeons?"
                    Bosses in more difficult dungeons have abilities that the group has to deal with other than "dodge aoes." For example there's a boss that goes invincible and the only way to end that is for the party to lure him toward some orbs so that he hits them and they explode on him.

If the group doesn't know how to deal with this he'll just keep hitting you and never die.

Others, if handled incorrectly, can just flat out one shot the whole party
                    Basically, bosses in the end game content arent just "hit it until it dies". The fights have lots of gimmicks or features that require individual responsibility. For example, getting orbs at the right time to avoid everyone dying instantly, choosing the correct colour orb to stop the boss resurrecting with more hp, getting a debuff at the right time to stop a boss oneshotting everyone etc.
                Did my first abyssals yesterday, I'm almost at t2 and figured I should at least see what they're about. Read the maxroll guide so I knew what the wipe mechanics were but otherwise went in blind.

Very first dungeon went smoothly because no wipe mechanics.

Second dungeon we wiped once to the second boss mechanic then I posted in chat "touch the orb that matches the color of the shockwave" and called out which color was needed, and won.

Third dungeon we wiped once at the first boss, I copypasted an explanation and one asshole didn't listen so we quit. Second attempt with new group same story with the second boss. 

Got a new group of randoms and got carried by someone in t2 lmao, the bishop died right before the rook orb hit and we were all confused running away from the enraged rook while our t2 gunslinger finished it off. Second boss was one accidental wipe and we were carried so hard we only had to do one sword phase.

Tldr some people really do try to just facetank everything and not actually play the game. I dun get it.
                Damn, my wall has been waiting a week for a new GPU cause mine just finally died after 7 years 🥲. Can’t wait to get back into Ark this Tuesday night! Too bad all my friends are ahead now T-T
            Also pc port has some terrible frame rate issues
        This is natural for any mmo, the numbers are still stronger than I thought two weeks after release.
        >too hard for them

hard to guess if youre stuck in queue or cant mm at all lmao
        Game isn't hard at all, the mobile gaming time gates are BS and grinding gems is fucking boring.
            lol how many times did you post in here saying the same bullshit? go find something else to do then
        lvling is the biggest wall. once i reached dungeons and realized that i didn't cared for the class and then had to face wasting the powers pass on another shitty class of manual lvling.   


I have a life nowadays and if the lvling wasn't as garbage as it is i could try it. but for now i shall wait 5 or 6 months to see what improvements on the lvling experience are implemented. but without the classes i like it's gonna take a while and i'm not alone. kinda odd how a newer mmo can have such a poorly designed lvling system. the xp fix is not a solution, but well... isometric laggy combat is not fun
            You get 2 free power passes and after that it’s only 600 gold to instantly level any character to 60 in your stronghold (well not instantly it takes 8 hours but you can set it and forget it).   You only ever have to level once in this game and then it is done forever.
            How about do 5min of research for classes before playing it to 50 and then making up your mind. You must be full on braindead
                It sounds like he didn't account for engravings either. Which is what make almost all classes exponentially more enjoyable.

He also calls the combat laggy, but that makes you question if he even played the game lol
                    Engravings really are nice.. I was enjoying Bezerker, but when I threw on Mayhem I was like ohh hell yes this is pod racing!@
                Eh sounds like an MMO isn’t right for his life atm anyhow. Regardless.
                Research =/= playing it for yourself. Plenty of classes sound fun on paper and absolutely suck in practice. Looking at you, FFXIV bard.
                    you should reach this conclusion far before hitting lvl 50
    Lost ark will hold more players than elden ring
        Well yes.. one is an MMO the other is a single player open world RPG with PvP and Coop. Very different games. Hence: Free vs $60.
            I’m not sure how an MMO being free means people won’t spend $60 on a game… Lost Ark had 1.5m preorders. The MMO vs single player part definitely matters though, which is why I said Elden Ring will probably not be able to retain the same relative player base.
                One price lends itself to a stronger base pull overtime which is aided by its play style.

You’re much less likely to buy a $60 game if it’s not something still in main stream discourse in 3 years. However you’re still just as likely to give a free game a chance, especially with ongoing content.

Seems like a pretty key factor. Not sure why one would ignore itX
                    >	One price lends itself to a stronger base pull overtime which is aided by its play style.

The price doesn’t matter, if a game is good people will buy it and play it. Look at games like Skyrim,  Borderlands & Witcher 3 which sold nearly 30m units. If the game is good it will retain players even if it is single player. 

>	You’re much less likely to buy a $60 game if it’s not something still in main stream discourse in 3 years. However you’re still just as likely to give a free game a chance, especially with ongoing content.

See above ^ ^ if a game is good, people will pay $60 for it. Witcher 3 is one of the best selling games ever (single player RPG wise) for a reason and released at $50 as did Skyrim I believe. Of course people will give a free game a chance but if it is shit it won’t retain players. Lost Ark is one of the best MMO’s made before even being released to the west.

>	Seems like a pretty key factor. Not sure why one would ignore itX 

I didn’t ignore it, it just doesn’t make sense. As we’ve seen from WoW before the last few years but even still they have a dedicated player base. $40 every two years + $15/month for a very long time, people were paying it for a reason. Skyrim and Witcher still have a huge player base across consoles & PC. If Elden ring ends up not being enjoyable after a couple hundred hours we will find out. Single player games can definitely retain huge player bases years after release.
                        You’re just straight delusional if you think price doesn’t play a role.
                            So you’re saying people would rather play a free game if it is shitty versus paying $60 for a good game? Yeah ok.
                                The fact that you even have to ask that question and you can’t imagine a scenario where someone would play a free game over a $60 game means you truly are a redditor good sir. Completely out of touch with reality.
                                    > The fact that you even have to ask that question and you can’t imagine a scenario where someone would play a free game over a $60 game means you truly are a redditor good sir.

Do you know how many free games exist on steam that have absolutely ZERO players? Rift is a free MMO and has been for years, it is completely dead....

> Completely out of touch with reality.

You don't understand how a shitty free game wouldn't be played more than a $60 good game? MLB the show is $60, RBI baseball is $15. I'll let you have a guess on which one has multitudes of a higher player base.
                        You’re talking about Skyrim which is in a league of its own. The other two still don’t touch it in terms of player retention. It’s also heavily modable which is how they design games from the ground up. None of fromsofts games are that heavily modded. Nor do they aim to design a game with endless replay ability. Their goals are narratively driven. You’ll see top games of all time that don’t have player retention. You’re construction of the argument is excluding a lot of other thingsZ
                            My entire point was games that are good retain players, if a game is free it makes no difference if it isn’t good. Their are tons of free games on steam and across the internet that are dead because no one plays them. Witcher 3 still gets 25k+ concurrent players on steam which is half of the player base or less.
                                Okay I agree with you. And my point was that if a game is good AND free it will usually have a better chance to maintain staying power then pay to play unless it has a good retention system such as modding. So we don’t necessarily disagree, I’m just augmenting your point by adding in some qualifiers for how well the successful games will do based on additional factors.
As a programmer, I can't even imagine how a line graph could ever be implemented that allows multiple values for the same point in time.
    If we expect an array of data point aggregates sorted by date/time ascending, one or more data points may have shown up not sorted correctly. Or maybe there’s a bug in the graphing UI that should be drawing a line between the data points and it picked the wrong two neighboring points.
If you queued up on 18th but only got to play on 19th, maybe it causes weird shit like this? :D
    Nah because steam charts can't register in game actions it just registers that you have the game open
maybe the lost ark IS a time machine 🤯
even with players dropping we still have queues XD, only transfers can sve the game from queues, shame so many players had to be lost, far away are the times where games could have 1 million + players at the same time
this is when Krause successfully evolved and tried to get out of the game.
I've been loving this game, scrapper has been stupid fun so far
queue is a helluva drug
Somehow player count returned
They were in the queue.
Already down 40% in a month
r/mildlypenis
ngl this a little bit fishy
    I mean it's clearly just an error in the database not much fishy there
When Elden Ring comes out and you spent 2 days playing it, but forgot to do.your dailies so you go back.
It’s to account for the queue times everyone’s complaining about. They will be playing in the future, duh.
Go home steam charts, your drunk.
it is from the dwarf quest when you go back in time
There's the 7th Ark
The Last Chartbender
The Arc is a time machine.
That's the algorithm catching the player base playing @ 24h+ sessions
Explains why the eu servers are so broken. Okay who of you mf's broke the time continuum?
It looks like they went back in time to not play the game
take me back
Probably realised 50% of the population was bots.
Once you hit t3 you do your chores and then pick your ass.  I planned on doing my chores and PvPing while receiving a small reward but they decided to launch without the tokens and vendor.  So I'll wait.
Wait, I thought it was Los Tark?
Looks like they tracked in game and in queue separately for a bit there.
Very fun game. Playing right now.
You could say its Non-functional
There's probably a Mokoko seed hidden there
Guy 1: Was the player base capped at 1 million or half a million players last week?  
Guy 2: Yes.
Failed the vertical line test. Not a function.
I've seen multi-boxers already. Why do they need to do this?
This is not a function
I laughed way harder than I should at this , good one
The number of current player is actually crazy , but I guess My perception is skewed by New world numbers
Yorn spoilers
The playerbase found out,  Elden Ring is cool but just another souls game.back to Ark.

Runescape, Maplestory, Ragnarok, Ultima
                            Yea, as someone who played Ragnarok for years, I'll never understand the grind complaints in games like this. I don't get why people want to be done with the game in a month when it's an MMO.
                                Even modern MMOs are grindy, or if not grindy they are time gated with how much you can do in a day/week.

FFXIV as great as it is, only has a few hours of non-side content per week after you're done progging the savage tier.
            I'm still low level and kinda new to MMOs - could you possibly elaborate on what you mean by "mechanics in dungeons?"
                Bosses in more difficult dungeons have abilities that the group has to deal with other than "dodge aoes." For example there's a boss that goes invincible and the only way to end that is for the party to lure him toward some orbs so that he hits them and they explode on him.

If the group doesn't know how to deal with this he'll just keep hitting you and never die.

Others, if handled incorrectly, can just flat out one shot the whole party
                Basically, bosses in the end game content arent just "hit it until it dies". The fights have lots of gimmicks or features that require individual responsibility. For example, getting orbs at the right time to avoid everyone dying instantly, choosing the correct colour orb to stop the boss resurrecting with more hp, getting a debuff at the right time to stop a boss oneshotting everyone etc.
            Did my first abyssals yesterday, I'm almost at t2 and figured I should at least see what they're about. Read the maxroll guide so I knew what the wipe mechanics were but otherwise went in blind.

Very first dungeon went smoothly because no wipe mechanics.

Second dungeon we wiped once to the second boss mechanic then I posted in chat "touch the orb that matches the color of the shockwave" and called out which color was needed, and won.

Third dungeon we wiped once at the first boss, I copypasted an explanation and one asshole didn't listen so we quit. Second attempt with new group same story with the second boss. 

Got a new group of randoms and got carried by someone in t2 lmao, the bishop died right before the rook orb hit and we were all confused running away from the enraged rook while our t2 gunslinger finished it off. Second boss was one accidental wipe and we were carried so hard we only had to do one sword phase.

Tldr some people really do try to just facetank everything and not actually play the game. I dun get it.
            Damn, my wall has been waiting a week for a new GPU cause mine just finally died after 7 years 🥲. Can’t wait to get back into Ark this Tuesday night! Too bad all my friends are ahead now T-T
        Also pc port has some terrible frame rate issues
    This is natural for any mmo, the numbers are still stronger than I thought two weeks after release.
    >too hard for them

hard to guess if youre stuck in queue or cant mm at all lmao
    Game isn't hard at all, the mobile gaming time gates are BS and grinding gems is fucking boring.
        lol how many times did you post in here saying the same bullshit? go find something else to do then
    lvling is the biggest wall. once i reached dungeons and realized that i didn't cared for the class and then had to face wasting the powers pass on another shitty class of manual lvling.   


I have a life nowadays and if the lvling wasn't as garbage as it is i could try it. but for now i shall wait 5 or 6 months to see what improvements on the lvling experience are implemented. but without the classes i like it's gonna take a while and i'm not alone. kinda odd how a newer mmo can have such a poorly designed lvling system. the xp fix is not a solution, but well... isometric laggy combat is not fun
        You get 2 free power passes and after that it’s only 600 gold to instantly level any character to 60 in your stronghold (well not instantly it takes 8 hours but you can set it and forget it).   You only ever have to level once in this game and then it is done forever.
        How about do 5min of research for classes before playing it to 50 and then making up your mind. You must be full on braindead
            It sounds like he didn't account for engravings either. Which is what make almost all classes exponentially more enjoyable.

He also calls the combat laggy, but that makes you question if he even played the game lol
                Engravings really are nice.. I was enjoying Bezerker, but when I threw on Mayhem I was like ohh hell yes this is pod racing!@
            Eh sounds like an MMO isn’t right for his life atm anyhow. Regardless.
            Research =/= playing it for yourself. Plenty of classes sound fun on paper and absolutely suck in practice. Looking at you, FFXIV bard.
                you should reach this conclusion far before hitting lvl 50
Lost ark will hold more players than elden ring
    Well yes.. one is an MMO the other is a single player open world RPG with PvP and Coop. Very different games. Hence: Free vs $60.
        I’m not sure how an MMO being free means people won’t spend $60 on a game… Lost Ark had 1.5m preorders. The MMO vs single player part definitely matters though, which is why I said Elden Ring will probably not be able to retain the same relative player base.
            One price lends itself to a stronger base pull overtime which is aided by its play style.

You’re much less likely to buy a $60 game if it’s not something still in main stream discourse in 3 years. However you’re still just as likely to give a free game a chance, especially with ongoing content.

Seems like a pretty key factor. Not sure why one would ignore itX
                >	One price lends itself to a stronger base pull overtime which is aided by its play style.

The price doesn’t matter, if a game is good people will buy it and play it. Look at games like Skyrim,  Borderlands & Witcher 3 which sold nearly 30m units. If the game is good it will retain players even if it is single player. 

>	You’re much less likely to buy a $60 game if it’s not something still in main stream discourse in 3 years. However you’re still just as likely to give a free game a chance, especially with ongoing content.

See above ^ ^ if a game is good, people will pay $60 for it. Witcher 3 is one of the best selling games ever (single player RPG wise) for a reason and released at $50 as did Skyrim I believe. Of course people will give a free game a chance but if it is shit it won’t retain players. Lost Ark is one of the best MMO’s made before even being released to the west.

>	Seems like a pretty key factor. Not sure why one would ignore itX 

I didn’t ignore it, it just doesn’t make sense. As we’ve seen from WoW before the last few years but even still they have a dedicated player base. $40 every two years + $15/month for a very long time, people were paying it for a reason. Skyrim and Witcher still have a huge player base across consoles & PC. If Elden ring ends up not being enjoyable after a couple hundred hours we will find out. Single player games can definitely retain huge player bases years after release.
                    You’re just straight delusional if you think price doesn’t play a role.
                        So you’re saying people would rather play a free game if it is shitty versus paying $60 for a good game? Yeah ok.
                            The fact that you even have to ask that question and you can’t imagine a scenario where someone would play a free game over a $60 game means you truly are a redditor good sir. Completely out of touch with reality.

Do you know how many free games exist on steam that have absolutely ZERO players? Rift is a free MMO and has been for years, it is completely dead....

> Completely out of touch with reality.

You don't understand how a shitty free game wouldn't be played more than a $60 good game? MLB the show is $60, RBI baseball is $15. I'll let you have a guess on which one has multitudes of a higher player base.
                    You’re talking about Skyrim which is in a league of its own. The other two still don’t touch it in terms of player retention. It’s also heavily modable which is how they design games from the ground up. None of fromsofts games are that heavily modded. Nor do they aim to design a game with endless replay ability. Their goals are narratively driven. You’ll see top games of all time that don’t have player retention. You’re construction of the argument is excluding a lot of other thingsZ
                        My entire point was games that are good retain players, if a game is free it makes no difference if it isn’t good. Their are tons of free games on steam and across the internet that are dead because no one plays them. Witcher 3 still gets 25k+ concurrent players on steam which is half of the player base or less.
                            Okay I agree with you. And my point was that if a game is good AND free it will usually have a better chance to maintain staying power then pay to play unless it has a good retention system such as modding. So we don’t necessarily disagree, I’m just augmenting your point by adding in some qualifiers for how well the successful games will do based on additional factors.
If we expect an array of data point aggregates sorted by date/time ascending, one or more data points may have shown up not sorted correctly. Or maybe there’s a bug in the graphing UI that should be drawing a line between the data points and it picked the wrong two neighboring points.
Nah because steam charts can't register in game actions it just registers that you have the game open
I mean it's clearly just an error in the database not much fishy there

I swear to god I did have lower queue on that day.

To me it looks like they added tracking servers in a different time zone then decommissioned the originals.
Well thanks now I have Hell March stuck in my head.
Steamdb graphs don't look like that.
That and once you get to 50 and grind gems for a few days the game gets really boring.
    Gems start at tier 2 not level 50 what are you on about
    They hated him, for he spoke the truth
        Its all good, they can play this crap mobile  tier mmo.
I'd say it's rather tedious than hard
    A lot of the more casual players hit a wall when they need to do mechanics in dungeons.
        That's certainly true but I think a decent amount of casuals is starting to quit as they realise how much grinding is needed to progress
            Yeah very true. I personally don't think the grind is too bad if you spread it out daily, but most people don't have the patience for that.
                For me personally the grinding for gems is just to boring, I would much rather grind for gear drops in a traditional mmo.
                    You also grind for gear drops.  Getting good accessories and gear with the correct tripod levels is important.
                        It just doesn't feel the same... probably the camera perspective (I hate it) and the no holy trinity. Game just feels extremely boring.
                I don’t mind the grind but there’s no way in hell you can even do certain dungeons with public groups anymore. I’m at the Rohendel abyss dungeons and I tried a public group and it’s just full wipe 3-4 times and I just gave up. 

You’re more or less forced to find a group to run end game(which is fine) but sometimes I don’t have enough players and one random is going to fuck up the run and kill your ENTIRE TEAM.
                    .
                        I didn’t even know that was a thing. Thank you! This’ll help
                        It's going from 9/10 parties wipe in matchmaking to like 6/10 parties wipe in party finder, it's still rough but much better overall.
                            I think it's expected that mistakes will happen.. some of the mechanics are pretty unforgiving.

That said complexly being unaware of the mechanics won't ever work.
                    Rohendel abyss is very easy and honestly if you give up after 3-5 wipes, endgame raids arent for you.

In ru we wiped on the same boss for 6hours in a row so 🤷🏾‍♂️

You can teach the randoms
                        I didn’t say I gave up on the  dungeon. Just on the group I was with.
                            That's the problem though with groups that quit after a few wipes, you are potentially resetting the progress you made by having new people that need a few wipes again to understand what's happening
                            That’s exactly what i meant, if you can’t handle 4 wipes without changing the group you aren’t gonna go very far in endgame.

It’s better to take some time to discuss the strat even if you cannot teach it (like telling people where they can learn it).

Because chances are the next group isn’t gonna be any better anyway and with the current issues on matchmaking it’s a waste of time imo.

Have fun though ;)
Hope i didn’t sound like an ass

                Even the old MMOs were grindfests. Hell, the old MMOs were bigger grindfests.

Runescape, Maplestory, Ragnarok, Ultima
                    Yea, as someone who played Ragnarok for years, I'll never understand the grind complaints in games like this. I don't get why people want to be done with the game in a month when it's an MMO.
                        Even modern MMOs are grindy, or if not grindy they are time gated with how much you can do in a day/week.

FFXIV as great as it is, only has a few hours of non-side content per week after you're done progging the savage tier.
    I'm still low level and kinda new to MMOs - could you possibly elaborate on what you mean by "mechanics in dungeons?"
        Bosses in more difficult dungeons have abilities that the group has to deal with other than "dodge aoes." For example there's a boss that goes invincible and the only way to end that is for the party to lure him toward some orbs so that he hits them and they explode on him.

If the group doesn't know how to deal with this he'll just keep hitting you and never die.

Others, if handled incorrectly, can just flat out one shot the whole party
        Basically, bosses in the end game content arent just "hit it until it dies". The fights have lots of gimmicks or features that require individual responsibility. For example, getting orbs at the right time to avoid everyone dying instantly, choosing the correct colour orb to stop the boss resurrecting with more hp, getting a debuff at the right time to stop a boss oneshotting everyone etc.
    Did my first abyssals yesterday, I'm almost at t2 and figured I should at least see what they're about. Read the maxroll guide so I knew what the wipe mechanics were but otherwise went in blind.

Very first dungeon went smoothly because no wipe mechanics.

Second dungeon we wiped once to the second boss mechanic then I posted in chat "touch the orb that matches the color of the shockwave" and called out which color was needed, and won.

Third dungeon we wiped once at the first boss, I copypasted an explanation and one asshole didn't listen so we quit. Second attempt with new group same story with the second boss. 

Got a new group of randoms and got carried by someone in t2 lmao, the bishop died right before the rook orb hit and we were all confused running away from the enraged rook while our t2 gunslinger finished it off. Second boss was one accidental wipe and we were carried so hard we only had to do one sword phase.

Tldr some people really do try to just facetank everything and not actually play the game. I dun get it.
    Damn, my wall has been waiting a week for a new GPU cause mine just finally died after 7 years 🥲. Can’t wait to get back into Ark this Tuesday night! Too bad all my friends are ahead now T-T
Also pc port has some terrible frame rate issues
lol how many times did you post in here saying the same bullshit? go find something else to do then
You get 2 free power passes and after that it’s only 600 gold to instantly level any character to 60 in your stronghold (well not instantly it takes 8 hours but you can set it and forget it).   You only ever have to level once in this game and then it is done forever.
How about do 5min of research for classes before playing it to 50 and then making up your mind. You must be full on braindead
    It sounds like he didn't account for engravings either. Which is what make almost all classes exponentially more enjoyable.

He also calls the combat laggy, but that makes you question if he even played the game lol
        Engravings really are nice.. I was enjoying Bezerker, but when I threw on Mayhem I was like ohh hell yes this is pod racing!@
    Eh sounds like an MMO isn’t right for his life atm anyhow. Regardless.
    Research =/= playing it for yourself. Plenty of classes sound fun on paper and absolutely suck in practice. Looking at you, FFXIV bard.
        you should reach this conclusion far before hitting lvl 50
I’m not sure how an MMO being free means people won’t spend $60 on a game… Lost Ark had 1.5m preorders. The MMO vs single player part definitely matters though, which is why I said Elden Ring will probably not be able to retain the same relative player base.
    One price lends itself to a stronger base pull overtime which is aided by its play style.

You’re much less likely to buy a $60 game if it’s not something still in main stream discourse in 3 years. However you’re still just as likely to give a free game a chance, especially with ongoing content.

Seems like a pretty key factor. Not sure why one would ignore itX
        >	One price lends itself to a stronger base pull overtime which is aided by its play style.

The price doesn’t matter, if a game is good people will buy it and play it. Look at games like Skyrim,  Borderlands & Witcher 3 which sold nearly 30m units. If the game is good it will retain players even if it is single player. 

>	You’re much less likely to buy a $60 game if it’s not something still in main stream discourse in 3 years. However you’re still just as likely to give a free game a chance, especially with ongoing content.

See above ^ ^ if a game is good, people will pay $60 for it. Witcher 3 is one of the best selling games ever (single player RPG wise) for a reason and released at $50 as did Skyrim I believe. Of course people will give a free game a chance but if it is shit it won’t retain players. Lost Ark is one of the best MMO’s made before even being released to the west.

>	Seems like a pretty key factor. Not sure why one would ignore itX 

I didn’t ignore it, it just doesn’t make sense. As we’ve seen from WoW before the last few years but even still they have a dedicated player base. $40 every two years + $15/month for a very long time, people were paying it for a reason. Skyrim and Witcher still have a huge player base across consoles & PC. If Elden ring ends up not being enjoyable after a couple hundred hours we will find out. Single player games can definitely retain huge player bases years after release.
            You’re just straight delusional if you think price doesn’t play a role.
                So you’re saying people would rather play a free game if it is shitty versus paying $60 for a good game? Yeah ok.
                    The fact that you even have to ask that question and you can’t imagine a scenario where someone would play a free game over a $60 game means you truly are a redditor good sir. Completely out of touch with reality.

Do you know how many free games exist on steam that have absolutely ZERO players? Rift is a free MMO and has been for years, it is completely dead....

> Completely out of touch with reality.

You don't understand how a shitty free game wouldn't be played more than a $60 good game? MLB the show is $60, RBI baseball is $15. I'll let you have a guess on which one has multitudes of a higher player base.
            You’re talking about Skyrim which is in a league of its own. The other two still don’t touch it in terms of player retention. It’s also heavily modable which is how they design games from the ground up. None of fromsofts games are that heavily modded. Nor do they aim to design a game with endless replay ability. Their goals are narratively driven. You’ll see top games of all time that don’t have player retention. You’re construction of the argument is excluding a lot of other thingsZ
                My entire point was games that are good retain players, if a game is free it makes no difference if it isn’t good. Their are tons of free games on steam and across the internet that are dead because no one plays them. Witcher 3 still gets 25k+ concurrent players on steam which is half of the player base or less.
                    Okay I agree with you. And my point was that if a game is good AND free it will usually have a better chance to maintain staying power then pay to play unless it has a good retention system such as modding. So we don’t necessarily disagree, I’m just augmenting your point by adding in some qualifiers for how well the successful games will do based on additional factors.

Putin wants the Ark
and you know why he needs it

Hold up, that's some Red Alert 3 shit, and Putin is not nearly as funny as Tim Curry was.
Its all good, they can play this crap mobile  tier mmo.
That's certainly true but I think a decent amount of casuals is starting to quit as they realise how much grinding is needed to progress
    Yeah very true. I personally don't think the grind is too bad if you spread it out daily, but most people don't have the patience for that.
        For me personally the grinding for gems is just to boring, I would much rather grind for gear drops in a traditional mmo.
            You also grind for gear drops.  Getting good accessories and gear with the correct tripod levels is important.
                It just doesn't feel the same... probably the camera perspective (I hate it) and the no holy trinity. Game just feels extremely boring.
        I don’t mind the grind but there’s no way in hell you can even do certain dungeons with public groups anymore. I’m at the Rohendel abyss dungeons and I tried a public group and it’s just full wipe 3-4 times and I just gave up. 

You’re more or less forced to find a group to run end game(which is fine) but sometimes I don’t have enough players and one random is going to fuck up the run and kill your ENTIRE TEAM.
            .
                I didn’t even know that was a thing. Thank you! This’ll help
                It's going from 9/10 parties wipe in matchmaking to like 6/10 parties wipe in party finder, it's still rough but much better overall.
                    I think it's expected that mistakes will happen.. some of the mechanics are pretty unforgiving.

That said complexly being unaware of the mechanics won't ever work.
            Rohendel abyss is very easy and honestly if you give up after 3-5 wipes, endgame raids arent for you.

In ru we wiped on the same boss for 6hours in a row so 🤷🏾‍♂️

You can teach the randoms
                I didn’t say I gave up on the  dungeon. Just on the group I was with.
                    That's the problem though with groups that quit after a few wipes, you are potentially resetting the progress you made by having new people that need a few wipes again to understand what's happening
                    That’s exactly what i meant, if you can’t handle 4 wipes without changing the group you aren’t gonna go very far in endgame.

It’s better to take some time to discuss the strat even if you cannot teach it (like telling people where they can learn it).

Because chances are the next group isn’t gonna be any better anyway and with the current issues on matchmaking it’s a waste of time imo.

Have fun though ;)
Hope i didn’t sound like an ass

        The fact that you even have to ask that question and you can’t imagine a scenario where someone would play a free game over a $60 game means you truly are a redditor good sir. Completely out of touch with reality.

Do you know how many free games exist on steam that have absolutely ZERO players? Rift is a free MMO and has been for years, it is completely dead....

> Completely out of touch with reality.

You don't understand how a shitty free game wouldn't be played more than a $60 good game? MLB the show is $60, RBI baseball is $15. I'll let you have a guess on which one has multitudes of a higher player base.
You’re talking about Skyrim which is in a league of its own. The other two still don’t touch it in terms of player retention. It’s also heavily modable which is how they design games from the ground up. None of fromsofts games are that heavily modded. Nor do they aim to design a game with endless replay ability. Their goals are narratively driven. You’ll see top games of all time that don’t have player retention. You’re construction of the argument is excluding a lot of other thingsZ
    My entire point was games that are good retain players, if a game is free it makes no difference if it isn’t good. Their are tons of free games on steam and across the internet that are dead because no one plays them. Witcher 3 still gets 25k+ concurrent players on steam which is half of the player base or less.
        Okay I agree with you. And my point was that if a game is good AND free it will usually have a better chance to maintain staying power then pay to play unless it has a good retention system such as modding. So we don’t necessarily disagree, I’m just augmenting your point by adding in some qualifiers for how well the successful games will do based on additional factors.
You also grind for gear drops.  Getting good accessories and gear with the correct tripod levels is important.
    It just doesn't feel the same... probably the camera perspective (I hate it) and the no holy trinity. Game just feels extremely boring.

    I didn’t even know that was a thing. Thank you! This’ll help
    It's going from 9/10 parties wipe in matchmaking to like 6/10 parties wipe in party finder, it's still rough but much better overall.
        I think it's expected that mistakes will happen.. some of the mechanics are pretty unforgiving.

That said complexly being unaware of the mechanics won't ever work.
Rohendel abyss is very easy and honestly if you give up after 3-5 wipes, endgame raids arent for you.

In ru we wiped on the same boss for 6hours in a row so 🤷🏾‍♂️

You can teach the randoms
    I didn’t say I gave up on the  dungeon. Just on the group I was with.
        That's the problem though with groups that quit after a few wipes, you are potentially resetting the progress you made by having new people that need a few wipes again to understand what's happening
        That’s exactly what i meant, if you can’t handle 4 wipes without changing the group you aren’t gonna go very far in endgame.

It’s better to take some time to discuss the strat even if you cannot teach it (like telling people where they can learn it).

Because chances are the next group isn’t gonna be any better anyway and with the current issues on matchmaking it’s a waste of time imo.

Have fun though ;)
Hope i didn’t sound like an ass
Even the old MMOs were grindfests. Hell, the old MMOs were bigger grindfests.

Runescape, Maplestory, Ragnarok, Ultima
    Yea, as someone who played Ragnarok for years, I'll never understand the grind complaints in games like this. I don't get why people want to be done with the game in a month when it's an MMO.
        Even modern MMOs are grindy, or if not grindy they are time gated with how much you can do in a day/week.

FFXIV as great as it is, only has a few hours of non-side content per week after you're done progging the savage tier.
So you’re saying people would rather play a free game if it is shitty versus paying $60 for a good game? Yeah ok.
