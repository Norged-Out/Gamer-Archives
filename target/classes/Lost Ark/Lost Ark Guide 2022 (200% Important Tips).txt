Also, this post is the sequel to Lost Ark Guide 2022 (100% Free).

**\[How to enjoy the game\]**

1. It is recommended not to skip the event cutscene video.
2. &#x200B;

**If you are looking for 100% fun** = Skip the side quest and proceed with the main quest only

**If you seek 100% perfection** = proceed with both the main quest and side quests

**If you are looking for 100% efficiency**=

1. Use the item dictionary by pressing the Alt and D keys on the keyboard at the same time

(Check the quests that can acquire runes and skill points in the item dictionary)

2) Clear the chain quest with the chain picture

3) Clear quests that give collectible points, skills, runes, and engravings

&#x200B;

Side quests that occur after clearing the main quest can be ignored. (Excluding Feiton, Punica, and Bern Southern Continents)

&#x200B;

**\[List of items that must not be used and should be saved\]**

1. Battle Item (=Used only in Endgame)
2. Select box (=Use only when needed)

&#x200B;

**\[Main story progression and play time\]**

Tier 1 → Tier 2 → Tier 3

\[Tier 1\] Luterra (10 hours) → Tortoyk (3 hours) → Anikka (3 hours) → Ardentine (4 hours)

→ Northern Vern (3 hours) → Shushire (3 hours)

\[Tier 2\] Rohandel (3 hours) → Yorn (2 hours) → Feiton (3 hours)

\[Tier 3\] Punica (2 hours) → Southern Vern (3 hours) → Rowen (3 hours)

( Please note that playtime varies from person to person. )

( Although not explained here, there are some islands that are connected to the main story as well as the continents. )

(Because the number of islands is too large, the order of play and play times of the islands are not explained. )

&#x200B;

**\[Leveling\]** I will explain the game system in the order of main story progression by continent.

&#x200B;

**<Tier 1>**

**1. Luterra**

**\[Card\]**

1. Obtain Executor Solas Card by completing the main quest
2. Wandering Merchants sell (Rare) Seria Card  (Wandering Merchants have a low chance to appear in the field on a random date. )

**Luterra Eastern** Wandering Trader spawn time rules (AM or PM): 2:30, 5:30, 6:30, 8:30, 9:30, 12:30

&#x200B;

**\[Wandering Merchants\]**

I will introduce you to the rules of the wandering merchant, but this is based on the Korean server, and there is a possibility that the Amazon server is different.

There are regularities in the time and items sold by the wandering merchant, and the field area where they appear.

**When a wandering merchant appears, it only lasts for 25 minutes and then disappears.**

For example, a wanderer who appears at 2:30 will disappear at 2:55.

However, the appearance date of the wandering merchant itself is random, and the items it sells and the area of the appearance field also contain random elements.

To conclude, wandering traders have both regularity and randomness.

&#x200B;

**Luterra Eastern** Wandering Trader spawn time rules (AM or PM): 2:30, 5:30, 6:30, 8:30, 9:30, 12:30

&#x200B;

**\[Recommend stronghold\]**

As you progress through the main quest, you will acquire a stronghold.

Stronghold is content that greatly contributes to your ability to play Lost Ark 100% FREE.

Various functions are unlocked whenever the level of Stronghold rises or the Stronghold quest is cleared.

&#x200B;

**\[Stronghold performance, function, reward, entertainment\]**

&#x200B;

**\[Dispatch stronghold\]**

Various seals and treasures can be obtained through dispatch

&#x200B;

**\[Stronghold Trader\]**

You can purchase items such as Legendary Runes, Collectible Points, and more from traders.

2. Pet level up possible

&#x200B;

**\[Stronghold Training Center\]**

You can automatically raise the battle level.

&#x200B;

**\[Guild\]**

Guilds, like Strongholds, are one of the things that contribute to 100% free play of Lost Ark.

It is recommended to join a guild. You can get Silma Bloodstone through various guild activities, and you can purchase useful items from the Silmael Bloodstone Exchange NPC.

&#x200B;

**\[Guild Activities\]**

Daily = Guild Donation (Silver), Guild Research Support

Every week = Participate in subjugation and occupation wars

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**2. Tortoyk**

A continent without mococo seeds.

Instead, there is NPC Totoma where you can obtain the Mococo Seed reward.

**\[ The Most Important Wandering Trader in Lost Ark  \]**

**Anikka** Wandering Trader Appearance Time Rules (AM or PM): 1:30, 4:30, 5:30, 7:30, 8:30, 11:30

&#x200B;

Wandering Merchants sell (Legendary) Wei Card (Wandering Merchants have a low chance to appear in the field on a random date. )

&#x200B;

If there is talk of a Wei card in the area chat, be sure to go buy it.

&#x200B;

The Light that Saves the World card set is the most valuable card set in Lost Ark (by dealer).

**Light to save the world** = Shandi, Ajena & Inanna, Ninab, Kadan, Bahuntur, Shillian, Wei

&#x200B;

You must always have at least **200,000 silver** in order to purchase a Wei card from a wanderer.

&#x200B;

**4. Ardentine**

**\[Heart of Krater Main Story Cinematic Dungeon\]**

Two treasures are sleeping.

One can be upgraded in a secret location.

Check out the true nature of the treasure.

It is also recommended to ride both treasures.

&#x200B;

**\[NPC Affinity\]**

**trust = sasha**

NPC Sasha provides the heart of a giant, so whenever you have time, proceed with the NPC affinity.

&#x200B;

**5. Northern Bern**

Most players reach combat level 50 in Ardentine or Northern Bern.

Endgame unlocks when you reach Battle Level 50.

&#x200B;

We recommend that you start with the main story first and then proceed to the end game.

&#x200B;

**\[How to play the game\]**

Continent main story progress → Item level shortage → Gear honing (item level upgrade) → Continent main story progress

&#x200B;

**The main story quests should always take precedence over the endgame.**

Main story quest color = orange gold or sky blue

&#x200B;

**\[In case of insufficient material, silver, gold\]**

1. Endgame play
2. Sell or buy items on the exchange

&#x200B;

**\[End Game\]**

**1. There is so much endgame content, priority is important.**

&#x200B;

**Daily content**(Daily Tasks) = Procyon's Compass, Chaos Dungeon, Guardian Raid, Una's Task(Epona Request), Stronghold, Guild

**Weekly content**(Weekly to-do) = Abyss Dungeon

**Things to do if you have time** = Island, NPC affinity, rune and skill point collection, collectible points, sub-character (Alt, Barrack) development, etc.

&#x200B;

**2. Chaos Dungeon and Guardian Raid are not required every day thanks to the break points.**

Each rest day restores 20 rest points. When you consume rest points, you can get double the reward.

Generally, players who don't have much time to play do this when their break points are between 40 and 100.

&#x200B;

**3. If you can't play the endgame even though the battle level is 50 or higher, clear the guide quest.**

&#x200B;

**\[Guide Quest Type\]**

1. Provide endgame access rights
2. Awakening skill provided
3. Main story guide
4. Content and system description

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/amfazoy1wpi81.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f3f2fae4fa35e669fde13cd80b123c52224a553

**\[Procyon's Compass\]** = Field Boss, Ghost Ship, Chaos Gate, Adventure Island

Click Procyon's compass among the widget icons in the upper right corner of the screen.

You can only earn rewards once per day, and the content you can participate in varies every day.

You can participate in Field Boss, Ghost Ship, and Chaos Gate every hour, and you can participate in Adventure Island only at certain times.

You don't have to participate all day long, because once you earn a reward once a day, you won't be able to earn any more rewards.

&#x200B;

**\[Gear Honing (Item Level Upgrade)\]**

1. Don't make the mistake of honing (upgrading) only your weapons. Both weapons and armor must be upgraded evenly.
2. If you run out of materials, silver and gold, play the endgame.
3. It is recommended to use auxiliary materials that increase the success rate of gear honing (item level upgrade) only for weapons when the success rate is low. This is because in general weapon destruction stones are more expensive than armor protection stones.
4. Tailoring and Metallurgy books are mainly used when they are cheaper than gear honing gold cost. These books are usually the most used in Tier 3.
5. I do not recommend using real money(royal crystal). If you want to use real money for gear honing (upgrades), I recommend only Marie Shop products.

&#x200B;

**\[Gear Transfer\]**

Use in the following situations:

**1. When acquiring a gear with a higher tier than the currently worn gear**

Tier 1 → Tier 2 → Tier 3

**2. When acquiring a gear with a higher grade than the currently worn gear**

Rare → Hero → Legend → Artifact → Ancient

**3. When acquiring a higher quality gear than the currently worn gear**

0\~30→31\~60→61\~90→91\~100

&#x200B;

When using tier 1 items in tier 2, the performance is reduced by 50%, so it is recommended to use gear transfer when acquiring tier 2 gear. Of course, the same goes for acquiring tier 3 gear.

Gear Transfer allows you to recycle the stats of your current gear into new gear.

&#x200B;

**\[Engraving\]**

Engraving 5 points = Engraving level 1

Engraving 10 points = Engraving Level 2

Engraving 15 points = Engraving level 3

Points are acquired through accessories, ability stones, and engraving books.

&#x200B;

Before Tier 3 Endgame, Engraving Books are the most important.

The rest can be worn roughly.

&#x200B;

**\[Engraving Book\]**

It can be obtained through various quests, contents, and events.

Do not buy on exchanges.

You can use 20 each to upgrade to the next level.

&#x200B;

**\[Recommend the order of using the engraving book)**

Use 20 Advanced (Tier 1) → Use 20 Rare (Tier 1 or Tier 2 or Tier 3) → Use 20 Hero (Tier 1 or Tier 2 or Tier 3) → Use 20 Legendary (Tier 3 Item Level 1370 or 1415 or 1475)

&#x200B;

To put it simply, you don't need a Legendary Engraving Book before item level 1475.

The reason is simple. Because the enemies are very weak.

&#x200B;

**\[Ability Stone\]**

Before Tier 3, you can wear anything.

Also, in Korea, points are distributed by paying attention only to hero grade, legend grade, and relic grade.

If you want to use the Ability Stone properly, try the following.

&#x200B;

Hero Rank Ability Stone = 5\~8 Points

Legendary rank  Ability Stone = 5\~9 Points

Artifact rank  Ability Stone = 5\~10 points

Penalty engraving = 0\~4 points

&#x200B;

However, it is not recommended to invest a lot of time and money in Ability Stones before Tier 3.

&#x200B;

**\[Accessories\]**

(Importance in Tier 1 and Tier 2) Bonus Effect (Talent) > Engraving > Quality

(Importance in Tier 3) Engraving > Bonus Effect (Talent) > Quality

&#x200B;

**\[Bonus Effect (Talent) \]**

In PVE, we mainly use three Bonus Effect (Talent) : Expertise, Crit, and Swiftness

It's not a good idea to use all three Bonus Effect (Talent). Choose two Bonus Effect (Talent) and use them.

Each class has a different recommended build, so please refer to class guides from various communities.

&#x200B;

**\[Skill Tree\]**

1. For boss monsters (Raid Boss, Dungeon Boss, Field Boss, Tower Boss, Cube Boss, etc.)
2. For normal monsters (chaos dungeon, field, etc.)
3. For PVP (Island, GvG, Lowen Continent)

Generally, two skill trees are used, and PVP users use three.

&#x200B;

You can equip a skill with up to 8 runes.

However, since the runes used in each skill tree are slightly different, there are actually more than 8 runes to collect.

&#x200B;

**\[Chaos Dungeon\]**

1. In general, clear 2 times a day.
2. Skill cooldown reduction orbs drop frequently. So, use your awakening skills generously. All skills can be used very quickly and often.
3. If you do not have enough materials for gear honing (item level upgrade), play various endgames instead of just chaos dungeons.

&#x200B;

**\[Guardian Raid\]**

1. Wear a battle item in the quick slot and play.

Usually worn like this:

Slot 1: Instant Health Recovery Potion

Slot 2: Time Stop Potion or omnipotent potion(Purifying Potion)

Slot 3: Destruction Grenade or Whirlwind Grenade or Corrosive Bomb or Fire Grenade or Sleep Bomb or Swift Robe or Stimulant

Slot 4: Flare or Pheromone Bomb or Whirlwind Grenade

2. Use the counter skill when the boss monster glows blue.

[https:\/\/www.inven.co.kr\/board\/lostark\/4821\/69196](https://i.redd.it/4mvpsgnt6si81.gif)

3. Some boss monsters can destroy parts. Destroy it with a part destruction skill or a destruction grenade.

4. If you don't know how to solve a puzzle, ask a member of your team or watch a guide post or YouTube video. If no one knows or is short on time, try a variety of things. Hints are sometimes helpful and sometimes not.

&#x200B;

**\[Abyss Dungeon\]**

1. Wear a battle item in the quick slot and play.

Usually worn like this:

Slot 1: Instant Health Recovery Potion

Slot 2: Time Stop Potion or omnipotent potion(Purifying Potion)

Slot 3, Slot 4: Destruction Grenade or Whirlwind Grenade or Corrosive Bomb or Flame grenade  or Swift Robe or Stimulant

&#x200B;

2. Use the counter skill when the boss monster glows blue.

3. Some boss monsters can destroy parts. Destroy it with a part destruction skill or a destruction grenade.

4. If you don't know how to solve a puzzle, ask a member of your team or watch a guide post or YouTube video. If no one knows or is short on time, try a variety of things. Hints are sometimes helpful and sometimes not.

&#x200B;

**\[2 Free Power Passes\]**

If you have cleared All main quest and achieved battle level 50, you can receive 2 free power passes. (In addition, if the Amazon server operates the same as the Korean server, you will be able to acquire 1 to 3 free power passes whenever a new class is officially released.)

&#x200B;

Here are some reasons to use the free PowerPass:

1. Play more endgame content and get more rewards (daily and weekly rewards)

The gold, silver, etc. currency acquired by the sub character (Alt) is shared with the expedition team (shared server). Also, the gear honing material item acquired by the sub character (Alt) can be put into the expedition warehouse and used by the main character.

&#x200B;

2. Experience various classes & prepare for buff or nerf patch update

(For example, if a person with two classes has one nerfed and one buffed, the damage from the nerf patch update is minimal)

&#x200B;

3. Use of Free Power Pass = Get Free Product = Benefit

&#x200B;

**6. Shushire**

\[Wandering Merchant\]

Wandering Merchants sell (Heroic)  Jin Madnick Card (Wandering Merchants have a low chance to appear in the field on a random date. )

**Shushire** Wandering Vendor Appearance Time Rules (AM or PM): 1:30, 4:30, 5:30, 7:30, 8:30, 11:30

&#x200B;

**7. Rohandel**

**\[NPC Affinity\]**

**trust = azena**

&#x200B;

The Handel Continent NPC Affinity can be progressed slowly when you have time.

It's not urgent right now.

&#x200B;

**<Tier 2>**

**8. Yorn**

**\[Wandering Merchant\]**

Wandering Merchants sell (Heroic) Caesar Card (Wandering Merchants have a low chance to appear in the field on a random date. )

&#x200B;

The Peyton Continent NPC Affinity can be progressed slowly when you have time.

It's not urgent right now.

&#x200B;

**\[Gem\]**

When tier 2 gems are used in tier 3, their performance is reduced by 50%. So don't invest too much time and money on tier 2 gems. Also, tier 2 gems or tier 3 gems, level 5 is enough for the time being.

And tier 2 gems above level 7 look very similar to tier 3 gems. Don't make the mistake of buying a tier 2 gem for a tier 3 gem.

&#x200B;

**<Tier 3>**

**10. Punica**

**\[NPC Affinity\]**

**Trust = Nia**, Shana, Nagi

Friendship = Squirrel Yom, Fox Saffiano, Hariya, Albion, Berbero

&#x200B;

Punica Continent NPC Affinity is the most important for Nia.

The rest of the NPCs may proceed slowly if time permits.

&#x200B;

**\[Final goal\]**

1. Collect at least 8 runes  (K)
2. All skill point potions and advanced skill point potions (K)

5) Hope to see you again alive = Jean Madnick, Baedan, Sian

&#x200B;

4. Item level 1340 (2 Punica Continent Abyss Dungeons can be entered)

&#x200B;

Press Alt and D on your keyboard at the same time to use the item dictionary

(Check the quests that can acquire runes and skill points in the item dictionary)

&#x200B;

**\[Collectible Point Recommendation\] Alt+L**

1. Mococo Seeds = 650 or 1150

Mococo Seed is not the most important collectible point, but it is the most convenient point to collect whenever you see it.

2. Giant's Heart = 12

3. Orpheus star = 6 or 7

4. Island Tokens = 20 or 85

5. Sailing adventures = 34

6. Great Art = 36 or 44 or 58

7. Mark of Ignea = 8 or 9 or 15

&#x200B;

**\[Adventure Book Recommendation\] N**

1. Artemis = 70%
2. Eudia=50% or 70%
3. Luterra West=70%
4. Luterra East=80%
5. Tortoyk = 70%
6. Anika = 70%
7. Ardentine=60% or 70%
8. Northern Bern=60% or 70%
9. Shoeshire = 60% or 70%
10. RoHandel = 70% or 80%
11. Yorn = 60% or 70%
12. Feiton = 60% or 70%
13. Punica = 80%
14. South of Bern=
15. Rowen=

&#x200B;

**\[NPC Rapport(Affinity) Recommendation\] Alt+N**

**NPC Rapport step sequence = Normal → Interest → Friendship → Trust → Affection**

Artifact Grade NPC Rapport Gift = Punica Continent NPC Nia, Whispering Small Island NPC Ninave

Legendary NPC Rapport  Gift = Punica Continent NPC Nia, Whispering Small Island NPC Ninave

Hero Grade NPC Rapport  Gift = Punica Continent NPC Nia, Whispering Small Island NPC Ninave

&#x200B;

The problem is that NPCs Ninab and Nia require very high propensity points. Fortunately, we have a way to skip this as a gift. Never make a mistake and focus on the explanation from now on.

&#x200B;

**\[NPC Nia\]**

1. Set the Rapport Points of 3000\~3299 for the first level of friendship.

If the level of friendship exceeds 3300, NPC Nia requires a very high propensity point.

(The Rapport quest must be cleared before entering the first level of friendship)

2. Gift 3 Artifact Grade Gift Items that give you 10,000 Rapport Points or 15 Legendary Grade Gift Items that give you 2000 Rapport Points.

(For skipping propensity point lock by providing 30,000 Rapport points in one shot)

You must provide a gift item of the same name at the same time. If the name is different, you will be locked into a propensity point.

(Also, please do not present the Kavatian Crown gift item to a female NPC as it can only increase 5,000 Rapport points.)

3. Trust Phase Success

&#x200B;

**\[NPC Ninav\]**

1. Set the Rapport Points of level 1 friendship between 10000 and 10299.

If the level of friendship exceeds 3300, NPC Nia requires a very high propensity point.

(The Rapport quest must be cleared before entering the first level of friendship)

2. Gift 5 Artifact Grade Gift Items that give you 10,000 Rapport Points or 25 Legendary Grade Gift Items that give you 2000 Rapport Points.

(Used to skip propensity point lock by providing 50,000 Rapport points in one shot)

You must provide a gift item of the same name at the same time. If the name is different, you will be locked into a propensity point.

(Also, please do not present the Kavatian Crown gift item to a female NPC as it can only increase 5,000 Rapport points.)

3. Trust Phase Success

&#x200B;

**Trust Level Recommendation** = Nia, Ninav, Blue-Eyes Calvasus

**Friendship Level Recommendation** = Beatrice

&#x200B;

**(Affection tip)**

Some of the NPCs in the affection stage can spend a hot night together.

On the Korean server, an affection level will be added to the two NPCs, and this update is expected to be applied to the Amazon server in 2022 as well.

&#x200B;

**\[Important Tips\]**

**1. Share the expedition (share the server)**

Runes, skill points, collectible points, propensity points, NPC rapports, etc. are shared by all characters in one server if they are acquired and used at least once.

**2. Warehouse system**

Items placed in the warehouse are linked throughout the system.

Therefore, if you put a material item in the warehouse, it will be consumed automatically during gear honing even if it is not in your inventory.

**3. Gameplay**

Always prioritize the main quest. The condition to go to the upper tier is to clear the main quest + meet the entry item level.

Stronghold performance: *request sexy pose*
    also important: you can make mazes
        in which to trap your friends
            1. Make a maze,
2. Trap your friends,
3. Request sexy poses from them!

*\*writing down intensifies\**
                Instructions unclear, dick caught in a maze
            Now this is the kind of endgame I'm interested in
            I read that and immediately thought of my horror themed animal crossing death maze. 

God imma do that again.
                video or it didnt happen :P
            That’s so evil, I love it
        Maze was the first thing i tryed to start making but i lack the space to trap some 2 inside it.
    Trust = sexy pose
    How does this work?
lol i like how it just says "Shoeshire" and moves right on to Rohandel.

Also, I've come across this guide multiple times and can never find it again when looking for it. Thanks a ton, saving this time.
    Yeah I even set this post to favorites. It will help us immense
    I don’t get why Rohandel is listed as tier 2 yet gives t1 mats and is unlocked 140 item levels below tier 2.
        How do you get to tier 2 lmao

It's not by not going to rohendel
The more I read about this game the more I feel like I need a PhD in lost ark or something. 

So. Much. Stuff.

Can't wait to finally play after moving to EU West :D
    I hit Level 50 yesterday, I read the guide twice and I'm sure it's really helpful but it feels like it is written in some old runic language because I have absolutely no idea how that could help me figuring out the lvl 50+ gameplay.
        This gearing guide by maxroll is pretty good https://lost-ark.maxroll.gg/resources/road-to-rohendel
            Even this is kinda nuts.
                To be fair thats the "speedrun to t3" guide they have a post level 50 one which is less intense, at that point in the game those systems become clearer though.
                To be fair thats the "speedrun to t3" guide they have a post level 50 one which is less intense, at that point in the game those systems become clearer though.
                One step at a time dude. All that guide really is doing is walking you through where to collect quests and complete them with an order to save you time.
                Ooops I linked the speedrun one, this is the less intense guide
https://lost-ark.maxroll.gg/resources/post-50-guide
            >My god I can't read that font for my life.
        I hit level 50 today and I am still confused about how to do dailies at least.
        There is a lot here that is translated with slightly different names, so unless you know the system already you won't know which system they are talking about :(

Lots of video and other guide on YouTube and maxroll though
    For real. I’m only level 21 so obviously I’m not going to understand a lot, but every guide I see leaves me more confused than I started. Can’t wait to play more though.
        Honestly just play the game...I'm a 46 and the more I read this shit the less it makes me want to play the game.  Just wanna put together some combos and get yelled at for not being good enough
            Best tip, is to just play and experience it for yourself. Try to save valuable items and currency until you know what you are doing. Rule of thumb: green stuff can be used however you feel like. Save blue/purple/orange items until you understand their effects.
        All you need to know is basically.

Finish main story. (should happen around lvl 40)

Finish "blue colored" quests (it is your new main story) until it gives you a chest that contains a full 301 item-leveled armor set. (will happen some time after you hit lvl 50)
        >every guide I see leaves me more confused than I started.



Lmao, nailed it. I actually have trepidation before reading guides now.



"Hmm.. This may hurt me."
    You don’t need to know everything right now. MMO’s are long term games, you slowly learn everything
    I felt this way when I started playing path of exile. I now have (only) 600 hours in that and still only scratched the surface in regards to content. Lost ark seems 10 times as complex and has infinitely more content. Glad I picked it up though, I’m loving it so far.
        Trust me. In terms of complexity and ITEMIZATION POE is on whole other level.
        Sorry, what? You need a guide twice as long as this one for an *introduction* into some of the mechanics in PoE. I'm not saying that makes it a better game or anything but the sheer complexity of it is absolutely absurd.
            You might be right, maybe I’m just used to it now after a few leagues and tons of builds. The newness of lost ark just has my brain scrambled with all the intertwining layers of quests and mats and other stuff lol
        I played poe since closed beta. It went for diablo style to idek what I'd call the mish mosh it is today. Way to many mechanics and what not it actually drove me to quit after 8years. PoE too much was much simpler and fun before maps were introduced
            I started playing during ritual league but it seems like every league they change a ton of core mechanics, changing skills, tons of nerfs and just killing a lot of good builds. I was getting tired of spending so much time on a build just to have it completely ruined next league.
    These guides are nice to know but you really dont need to read any of these things to enjoy the game and do well. Sure theres some noob traps but for the most part just do what interests you as you go through the story. Then you can come back to these kinds of guides and resources when you're stuck.
    Just felt this way to. Kudos to the guy helping us with the guide but i dont know what the guide is trying to teach me 80% of the time
Koreans are the most helpful gamers ever! I had no idea 😙
    This is anecdotal and may be a broad generalization but the few Korean friends I have that moved here at a young age are very organized and methodical with everything they do so I assume a lot of Korean gamers have tons of helpful content like this they just need to copy and paste.
        Koreans are the best gamers - it is known.
            Japanese: oh thank goodness the weirdos moved onto a new Asian country to worship.
                Japan were considered gods of fighting games for a long time, Koreans were the gods of RTS since Starcraft and then League of Legends, which isn't really an RTS but controls similar to one.  It's a shame Dota 2 never really took off in Korea.
                    Sports/competiton is all about structure, organization and support and then critical mass. The best gamers come from communities where there's plenty of people who help others achieve those competitive goals, something that Korean starcraft players had an advantage in, and Japanese FGC players had for fighting games. 

Its like olympics, more people and more money and more interest = better players once enough time has passed.

                Have you been living under a rock?
                    I'm making a joke about the increase in koreaboos. It's not that deep.
                *Koreaboos
    I think some of it has to do with most games requiring you to use your social security number just to create an account, don't know if it's still like this today but when I was younger I had to ask my family in Korea to give me their SSN so I could play some games. It keeps the behaviors in line.
    Why is there ~20 hours of main quest? I couldn't get past lv 40 because all you do is walk around clicking and doing pointless dungeons where gear/skills/deaths don't matter.

Does the game get better after 50 or I'm looking at another 12 hours of this?
        Leveling is kinda boring but when you get to lvl 50 and finish castle vern storyline, you willa have almost all t1 endgame unlocked. That means your gameplay changes from 50/50 walking talking/fighting into 20/80 sailinig/fighting. It took me around 25 hours of total gameplay for the first time to get there ;)
            25 hours to reach level 50, or 25 hours total?
                Probably to reach 50. But that's not even an issue this is an MMO. It would take thousands upon thousands of hours to "beat" this game. By the time you would "beat" it there would be more and more content to do.
                    > thousands of hours to "beat" this game.

of course, that's not an issue. My issue was the game so far has been a devil may cry/god of war instead of an mmorpg
                        Ah I see. I think that is just typical MMO behavior right? At least in this day and age of MMOs. You level up and quest and basically play story mode or co-op story mode until you get to end game and reveal the rest of the game.
        I've felt like I've been on crazy pills. Everyone is hailing this as the best MMO they've ever played (minus the launch and server issues), meanwhile I'm roaming around the most linear questing I've ever done in an MMO, spamming G, listening to bad voice acting and boring cut scenes in an ultra generic story that can't pick even a handful of themes to stick with. I literally just fought an army of clowns and suddenly I'm on a pirate ship and then I'm in "Honey, I Shrunk The Kids". I have thematic whiplash. Meanwhile, I take out my electric guitar to teleport to town, and never put my pistols away while I gesture wildly to NPCs, waving my guns in  their face.

I keep holding out hope that the end-game will reel me in, because both me and my buddy I'm leveling with feel like we're losing our minds. I understand the game isn't going to be for everyone, but I have a lot of MMO experience in general from way back in Ultima Online and EQ, and years in WoW, Rift, GW2, FFXIV, TERA, and more... this has been the dullest experience I've ever had from start to end-game to date.

I walked in with high hopes since I love the idea of an MMO mixed with an ARPG, since those are two of my favorite genres, and we both feel that the combat has been great, but everything else has been so lackluster for us.
            This game is ALL about end game. Theres a reason you get 2 free lvl 50 boosts once you compete MSQ. Theres a reason you can use 600g to power boost up to 9 toons. The Devs are confidant that their endgame is what keeps ppl playing. I agree that the leveling was boring....but you do it once and never have to do it again unless you want to. I hate leveling in every MMO ive ever played tbh. Im an end game person.
                Great, thanks, that's comforting to hear at least. I only knew about the 2 boosts and not the other stuff, so that's even better. Appreciate the info!
            >I literally just fought an army of clowns and suddenly I'm on a pirate ship and then I'm in "Honey, I Shrunk The Kids". I have thematic whiplash.

This sounds like quite a phenomenal time. Sorry you don't enjoy the game!
                Yeah its a blast to me and this description is hilarious lol.
                Kokomos, when will they learn?
            >years in WoW, Rift, GW2, FFXIV, TERA, and more…

I feel like I’m the one who’s on crazy pills when I read comments like this one.

I didn’t play Rift, but I played all those others, and I find the leveling in Lost Ark to be EXACTLY the same experience except Lost Ark’s combat is fun.

Of those you listed, Tera is the only one that’s fun to play on a gameplay level before endgame. All the others are not only the exact same endless chain of fetch quests as Lost Ark, but tied to a zero-gameplay combat system.

WoW - pick enemy, quote numbers at each other, the one who quoted the higher numbers wins. Leveling in Shadowlands was far more miserable than leveling in Lost Ark, especially if you want to talk about bad story.

FFXIV - I feel like when people talk about leveling in FFXIV they forget that ARR is just a series of fetch quests broken up by exposition. It’s all setup for the story to start in Heavensward.

Point is, I find my leveling experience in Lost Ark to be an exact 1 to 1 match for my leveling experience in every single other MMO.

Except the combat is fun.

And then you get to endgame content, which is fun to do, just like in every other MMO.

I really don’t understand how other long-term MMO fans have any kind of problem with Lost Ark. I feel like we would have collectively built up a tolerance for this sort of thing by now.
                Yeah Lost Ark is one of the few games where I get off my mount to fight random shit because combat is just so fun.
                    Seeing so many people talk about how fun the combat is, even while leveling,  makes me wonder if I chose the wrong class.  I'm playing as a berserker and still leveling, and so far 90% of combat is walking up to a pack of mobs and pressing 1 or 2 buttons to delete everything, which is cool the first few times but not super engaging, imo. Hoping to have the time to grind through the rest of the leveling this weekend so I can unlock some of the endgame content and hopefully understand the hype.
                        Oh man you should go make new characters and use the class tester to try out a bunch of specs. I think warrior and mage are the most boring classes.

Gunslinger, deathblade, scrapper, sharpshooter, all are really fun with interesting combos - esp deathblade.
                            Good call, I'll try out a few more while I grind my way towards the power pass. Gunslinger and Deathblade definitely look interesting, and I'm most excited for when lancemaster comes eventually.
                                Ooh I didn't know more were coming. Yeah I want to get the power pass too so I can have the other classes on this server. But apparently u have to complete the main story after 50 which may take a while.
                        Honestly mayhem berserker is mostly just like 2 buttons. Once you unlock the power pass I’d look into some of the more complex gameplay classes
                            Good to know I'm not the only one who feels that way, wish I'd put more thought into my class selection beyond just going for the big sword. Looking forward to getting the power pass to try other classes.
                Thank god, I thought I was going crazy. How are there all these comments about leveling with the “I’ve play xyz MMO” comments but then basically show you’ve never played those games at all? Or maybe they’ve got a giant hate boner for this game? Idk this is such a standard mmo with a semi boring grind to max level where the real game starts.
                Exactly this. If you dont like boring leveling process maybe dont play theme park mmos? This is sort of what the leveling process is. A running and dialogue simulator with some skill usage on enemies that are designed for anyone to be able to kill. 

Lost ark just actually makes the last part fun. Lost ark also has a ton of content for casuals and a ton of progression for die hards. This is a really really really good mmo and it is possible that maybe the genre just isnt for you anymore.
                I disagree, I found guild wars 2 was pretty unique and pretty fun to level in. It has a pretty unique system that does a good job embracing multiplayer. I also really enjoy lost ark though so I agree with most everything else you said.
                    The thing that made leveling in GW2 was the number of "Oh what's that?!" things around  - jump puzzles, vistas, collectibles, area events, etc. to just jump in on to get rid of the monotony of "My child is dying, please go kill 14 Skilabundoos for their venom sacs to make this potion".

Lost Arks has a bit of those with there being a bunch of collectibles/vistas/looking out for the world bosses but GW2 had a TON of them.
                        I agree. I’m not crazy about the story in GW2, but the exploration is fantastic.
                I guess I valued the quality of the cut scenes/dialogue/story to reel me in rather than only the combat. Rift was my favorite of the ones I listed because the zones were more interactive and changing, with invasions and rifts popping up that you'd have to deal with. GW2 was also fun to level since you could literally do whatever you wanted and level up, with an emphasis on exploring and PVP and such. ESO was another favorite (I forgot to list specifically), since the zones are so beautiful, and most of the quests are actual lines with a story and characters with real voice acting, and choices that matter. TERA was also lovely in terms of how beautiful it was and how engaging the combat was. I didn't hate WoW, it was very fetch-y and required so much time running around from zone to zone, but still the quality of the game and the cut scenes and the story (up until a certain point) was enough to keep me going.

Combat alone \*is\* enough to keep me going, but the questing in Lost Ark is much less combat than it is carrying barrels, talking to someone 3 feet away from someone else and then going back and talking to them, and running from point A to point B. Even when there is combat, generally speaking it's "kill these 3 mobs, even though there's 20 there" and then you walk up and 1-shot them and walk back and talk for another 2 minutes.
                    >	I guess I valued the quality of the cut scenes/dialogue/story to reel me in rather than only the combat.

Yeah, that makes sense to me.

I can put up with lackluster combat if the story is good, or vice-versa. But I can see how if you want the story to make you invested in the gameplay, Lost Ark would be a hard sell.

The story gets a little better after North Vern, mainly because (for the most part) NPCs stop showing up after the boss fight and “saving” you from a fight you just won. Also, there are some cool characters and set pieces in Rohendel and Yorn.

But I find it’s Guardian Raids and Abyssal Dungeons that are keeping me engaged.
                        Yeah, it's hearing about those dungeons/raids and seeing some of the video of combat and mechanics from those that are mainly the push for me to keep going. I'm optimistic I'll enjoy that part of the game a lot more. Thanks for taking the time to share the info and your experience! Hopefully I'll be starting that content within a few days here. Hearing all of you reply is motivating to keep pushing through.
                    > I didn't hate WoW, it was very fetch-y and required so much time running around from zone to zone, but still the quality of the game and the cut scenes and the story (up until a certain point) was enough to keep me going.

This wow experience is extremely foreign to me and makes absolutely no sense to me. WoW has basically zero cutscenes till somewhere around Legion. Mists and a couple others have a few here or there, but vanilla wow has like the intro cinematic and basically nothing else.

Maybe you came to wow after leveling got totally gimped, but vanillas leveling game play was basically 10 days /played with basically no cutscenes, and reading thousands of walls of text from quest givers for your story. No cutscenes, no story explanation, barely any dialogue, just lots of fetching and reading.

GW I kinda understand your perspective one but GW has always had a great leveling/world experience. FFXIV is kind of all over the place as well, but does have a few cutscenes tying it back together, but I generally found that way more dry and even less compelling than Lost Ark. The rest of your list I don't really understand as LA just feels better... Didn't play rift though.

But compare it to any of the previous gen mmos like WOW at least through WOTLK or EVE, or even further into classics like OSRS, UO, EQ, etc and this is just no comparison IMO. This opinion screams to me of more modern theme park mmo experience instead of anything else.
                        Came here to say that what you just wrote about wow. As someone who turned to wow vanilla servers as soon as Nostalrius launched and never looked back at retail, i was so confused with his take on wow
                            Yeah this is a huge "problem" with discussions about WoW IMO. WoW in 2006 vs 2009 vs 2012 vs 2018 are all entirely different games. Claiming you've "played a lot of wow" is kind of meaningless because we could be talking about like 8 different iterations of the game.

Cinematics and a "story" are parts of modern WoW that did exist for the first third of its lifetime. Comparing WoW in the past few years to LA is very different than comparing vanilla to LA.
                                You're right, I didn't play vanilla. I should have been more specific.
            Can confirm, questing is boring as fuck. Spamming g all day also kinda hurts my hand after a while. Wish they'd just let you hold g instead

But after that the game is super fun. Everything from guardian raids, abyss dungeons, to even solo tower challenges. You can get into sailing stuff, do world bosses, and all kinds of other things. End game is packed with a variety of great content that made the main quest worth doing
                You can mouse click instead of g spamming for quests, only need g to accept rewards or accept the quest.
                    I've been doing that, too. I've been trying not to spam my way through all the dialogue and cut scenes since I've been holding out some hope with them, but I mean more like "move this barrel" -> G -> climb this rope! -> G -> ride this zipline! -> G -> talk to this person! -> G -> pull this lever! -> G -> Nod at this person! -> G... oh, /nod  


I guess I click some of them, too, but still.
                Thanks, I'll keep chugging along then and continue holding out hope!
                    I'm sure people told you already, but just in case, rushing through the main story quests definitely gets you there fastest. You can ignore everything else if you want
                        I've heard both, I had some other friends telling me not to skip it or I'd have to go back, but then I keep reading that I can ignore all side quest stuff entirely. We're level 43 now, so it won't be that much longer I guess, we're just having trouble staying motivated, and put off playing the last few days as a result. Hoping to hit 50 and start the end-game stuff this weekend, at least. Thanks for the info. :)
                            The side quests are completely optional. You don't ever need to go back and do them unless you just want to lol. There may be a select few you'll want the rewards from later, but the majority aren't necessary. Either way, good luck
                                That's good to know, I may skip the rest and just push the main quest to finish the story. I appreciate all the info, thanks for taking the time!
                    Also of note, you don't really ever need to do the main quest line again.  You get 2 power passes which let you take alts to 50 instantly and then you can spend gold to exchange knowledge in your stronghold to skip the quest for more alts.  So it isn't like you have to slog through that story over and over.
                        I did hear about that! I'm thankful for that, since I've been intrigued by the Bard and also want to play a melee character at some point, but the idea of getting from 1-50 again manually is especially daunting at the moment. Appreciate the info!
            it sounds like you're around tortoyk so far? my friends and i were also pretty bored leveling, although we haven't played mmos and have little to compare to. it's picked up since we finished Vern - chaos dungeons are fun, and have the path of exile mapping feel, and guardian raids were the first thing that felt challenging and interactive, with lots of attack patterns to dodge or counterattack (and good lord when i got hulked the first time by a boss...i feel bad for loki now)

but then i went into an abyssal dungeon with a few friends and wiped several times in a row, and oddly, that's what got me hooked. we figured out the attack patterns, how to deal with the wipe mechanics, and it felt like an accomplishment, and what i look forward to most going forwards. 

unfortunately, unless i missed something, it seems like we can only clear once a week, i.e. if we have other friends or guildmates struggling with the dungeon, we can't help sherpa them.
                What you described is exactly what I went into the game hoping for. An ARPG-feel with MMO bossing mehcanics and dungeon/raiding parties. I love a good grind, I just found the game difficult to get into thus far and keep hoping for some more meat to sink my teeth into.
            If you feel like the combat is good, and it’s enough for you to stick to a game, the game does indeed get much better at 50 in my opinion

If you can stick it out until 420 gear score and try the 4th guardian raid, that’s when the game really clicked for me. Prior to that, the enemies were super easy and I could see it getting boring after a few weeks. 

What sucks is that it’s behind level 50, and doing a chain of side quests for roughly 2 hours hopping between islands. 

Another thing would be the abyss dungeons at 340 but I went into it and got placed with some 500 gear score people so I didn’t even see any of the major mechanics of the fights. They killed the bosses way too quickly, and it wasn’t fun. The second time I ran it, my group wasn’t nearly as geared and it would have been another time that the game would have clicked, I had a blast and a good sense of accomplishment 

If you don’t love the combat too much, the game probably isn’t for you imo
                The combat has been the saving grace for me so far, I like the class I'm playing and swapping between the bars and cooldowns, and being mobile and whatnot. I'm hoping once the endgame picks up I'll get to focus more on that and less on the tedious stuff. I don't mind a grind, I have thousands of hours in PoE and the Diablo series, I'm used to it, but those games are all combat which makes the leveling feel better.  


I'll stick with it, thanks. :)
            The 'themes' you are referring to are entirely different regions of the game. It's not all castles and knights on every single continent. 


Thankfully, unlike all those other games mentioned, you really only have to level up once, which to me is a massive upgrade (having played the intro for all those games multiple times). Knowledge transfer in your Stronghold can automatically bring up a new character to the same progress as your main. Though most recommend at least getting to Tier 2 first before using it.

That's great to know, thank you!
            yeah I'm on the same boat here. Don't know why they locked the game content behind a 20 hour grind. Even in new world I had fun right off the first levels
            IDK. The quests for me have been "Its so bad its good" in a crack fueled hallucinogenic sort of way. But for me the draw is breadth, depth - and perhaps mostly importantly - game feel.


I played all those games too, from Ultima to Aion and etc...  A lot of games I really loved and still love in a nostalgic sense. And all of them are flawed in some way. Ultima in hindsight is a clunky mess in a generic medieval world. Dark Ages of Camelot is an utter slog which for most of the tenure of its better days was a directionless snoozefest that exceled in some ways.


I can't think of an MMO that has ever had a story that really pulled me in with the exception of Warcraft but only because of childhood nostalgia for Orcs vs Humans.


The absurdities of Lost Ark are amusing for me in their own ways. The utter laziness of these NPCs to pay me to move something 5 feet, or to have a dwarf sit in my pocket while I play music for eggs and rocks... Honestly its a relief to not have to give a fuck about it all lmao.


 A lot of these other MMOs took themselves way too seriously when their story was equally unworthy of being read. I spam G and I'm pretty sure I know the majority of whats going on in Lost Ark and its an utterly goofy mess that is The Room levels of awful entertainment.


But yeah. Really its the breadth of the world and the game feel that are doing it for me right now. I laughed at your comment about the clown army which was followed closely by a really heavy holy inquisition and then I was trying to get a boat and hanging out with pirates. Lmao. 10 hours or so later and I havent even heard about Armen again - perhaps for the best. If I had my choice, Mokamoka would be my sidekick forever though.
                Yeah, the feel of the combat and such, and some of the little boss fights we've done is literally the only thread we're holding onto right now, but it's enough to keep us gently pushing through the game hoping to get into that grind at the end with the majority of the game hopefully being combat instead of moving leaves and barrells and fertilizer around lol  


We're certainly viewing it all as absurd in terms of the story/questing, but I think we lost the humor in it along the way, and just want to fight things.
            So much this. Glad I'm not alone.
            You're a fuckin nutjob bro, all that shit you just said sounds amazing.
            My main group played since the 8th and have been doing daily guardian raids and abyss dungeons and it’s been a blast. My other friend decided to join a little late and NO ONE wanted to redo the campaign. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!! 😂

                    I can't think of an MMO where leveling isn't ultra easy.  Pretty much all of them are auto pilot going from place to place and collecting boxes/feathers/bugs/whatever this NPC needs for their mid-life crisis.

                            Imagine an arpg style game where if you pulled too many mobs you died. This is not a game many people would want to play as an mmo (could be good roguelike though!).
                                [deleted]
                                    What endgame scenario punishes you for pulling multiple trash mobs again?
                            While I agree you certainly can't grab nearly as many mobs in WoW as you do in LA, outside of classic which is a balancing nightmare you could grab entire camps and burn them down EASILY.

The only time you really die leveling in WoW is if you go AFK and aggro something.
            Well that's what the power pass for finishing Vern is for along with the knowledge transfer at your stronghold. I have 2 alts that I'm gonna boost
                [deleted]
                    Well yeah once. Luckily you're not forced to play the game.  I assume.
        game gets much better, there are dungeons in which many mobs spawns and you need to mass kill, pretty satisfying imo and there are a lot of bosses/raids, bosses are 100% skill and after you advance 1-2 wiping mechanics appear. You still have plenty of G clicking tho, you need to complete your main quest (ignore all secondary quests) and after that look for the isles guide, pretty boring but it's the fastest path to upgrade.
        There was a point around level 35 to 40 that fell flat for me, but once you reach the final area of Luterra, you see the horizon, get your ship, and the game blows open from there.
        The dungeons are fun. The visuals were pretty great. I hate the quests too, but I really enjoy my time with the scenery, dungeons and field bosses.
        i was alredy happy with PVP and got to 50 and did some end game just to try it out and i cant put it down and haven played pvp in like 3 days, the end game is sooo much, especially abysals
    [deleted]
        So don't read it? What a stupid take.
        Then ignore their tips? This game is incredibly overwhelming to begin with, having tips and guides to help newer players along is only helpful. It’s up to you to ignore it if you want to play through an MMO blind. 

It’s funny you speak like there’s only one way to play MMOs, let others play the way they want.
            I honestly don't understand why people find this game overwhelming.... Maybe it's because people are blazing through it to get to level 50 and not actually playing the game to learn what is happening as you progress....
>Wandering merchants have a low chance to appear

>Wandering merchants are RNG elements that appear with a random probability

I assume this is just a translation error but wandering merchants themselves are NOT random. It's pretty well know when they appear. Always on an hourly schedule X:30 and up for 20 minutes. WHERE they appear inside the continent + WHAT they sell is random though.

https://lost-ark.maxroll.gg/resources/wandering-merchant-guide

So say if you are after the Wei card then you only have to check Mac in Anikka at 1:30, 4:30, 5:30, 7:30, 8:30, 11:30 (AM and PM) + see the locations above in the link, they are always near a tripod so takes like 2 minutes to go around.

Save brifost to the continent so you can travel there more easy.
    Yup. You know it right. Wandering merchant appears in a certain logic. Also as a same KR user just like the writer, I feel a lot of information he's talking is based on KR progress such as 'save your battle item'. Especially 'how to enjoy' part. Each user has a different goal, different taste and it's funny to tell them the right way.
        [removed]
            There can be more than one merchant up at a time, but not every merchant is guaranteed to spawn.
    Is the wei card name the same? Or is the name diff in the english version?
        Same
Now the problem is how to understand all this
    I think you can read this article when you're worried about what to do now after doing everything.
        Ya i think its too early for me to involving myself with all those.. stuff
Weird that there is so much hate for the sidequests.  
A huge chunk can be done close by or simultaneously with mainquests.  
They are quick to do and have some fun stories from time to time.  
If they are longer they often provide better rewards to compensate you for it.  
  
I am really liking them tbh.
    Yep. They're quick; they're literally all in the exact same areas as the main line almost constantly overlapping those quests; they provide new players (which all of us are unless we hopped on RU/KR servers) with useful items, extra experience, and practice with our skills and builds, as well as the game's lore if there's any interest in that; and they flesh out this game's world in a way that makes it more than slowly increasing numbers in a spreadsheet.

I can't get behind any of these guides saying to skip all that. I get it, it's done to push you to the end ASAP but what's the rush here? The game came out a week ago and you're ready to skip ahead to the endgame grind. And yes, it is the endgame grind. Don't buy this bullshit about "the game starting at 50". The game starts when you create your character and pick a class. You proceed through 50 levels of that game.

You can either joylessly sprint through that part so you can keep up with your favorite content creator or friends doing the same, or so you can catch up to Koreans and Russians who have been at it for far longer, but why? What's the point? Who are you trying to impress?

This isn't how we played most of our favorite MMOs coming up. It's not even how we played our favorite ARPGs. It's not what made them stand out as games we fondly remember and have this sense of nostalgia for. Stop ruining games with this weird sweaty minmaxing mentality.

Slow down and actually enjoy your time with the game, I promise you the endgame will still be there if you take a week or two to get to it instead of a day or two.
        This game was designed for the endgame to be the "main game" from the director himself - so, the game starting at 50 isn't complete bullshit. Yes, your leveling experience is very useful (especially if you know to pick up collectibles/skill points/engravings/etc) but it isn't the "game", if that makes sense.

You're projecting a lot with that "joylessly sprint" comment. Maybe that isn't how you want to play, and that's okay. Doesn't mean people it's joyless for others. 

You seem to have a rough time with the idea that people can enjoy playing the game a different way than you. I promise, you can play the game you want and they can play the game they want, and you'll both have fun.
        The point of skipping side quests , is that you get to the actual end game sooner. All those side quests are not going any where and you can do them anytime, and many of the endgame quests will be leading you back into the same areas. So while you are still under lvl 50, there are people who are 50 already, and have unlocked their dailes, and they get to knock out all their dailes and weeklies, then with the free time, they can clear the rest of the "side content". By taking it slow and doing every side quests, it will slow you down and you will be wasting daily/weekly free resources that are not available to you pre-50.
    For sure it is not like other games where a side quest will have you traveling to other continents and doing god knows what. A lot of times a side quest completion will be at the very same NPC you are using for main quest completion.
Wandering merchants appear on schedule, they are not random times. 

Once appeared, it will be in a random location chosen out of all possible locations for that particular merchant. 

All channels share that merchant location for next 25 minutes.
    Where can I check that schedule?

"If there is talk of a way card in the area chat, be sure to go buy it."

You have no idea how relieving this is to read lmao. I went afk during my questing and when I came back there was a merchant sitting next to me, so I looked at what he had and saw a Wei card. I almost didn't buy it because it cost over 70% of my silver and I was only like level 44, but I bought it in the end. And then I regretted it for the last few days :'D So seeing this makes me relieved that I didn't waste most of my money on something useless \^\^;

Thank you for the useful guide, I'll definitely be using it :)
    I heard stories of Korean players taking breaks at work just to go to a PC Cafe to pick up the Wei Card from the merchant.

It's almost comical, and you saved yourself some trouble later.
I appreciate you compiling and sharing this info but it makes the game sound more daunting than appealing to me. I like the game so far but I'm torn between being a meta gamer who does thing efficiently, and just feeling it out for myself. There is just so much, all the time.
    I see a lot of these "here is the path you must follow" posts and it was a turn off for me too. 

So I said fuck it I'm just going to play the game. I haven't been bored yet. I just do whatever I feel like doing and it feels like I'm progressing in the game no matter what. 

I can run chaos dungeons and guardian raids.. or sometimes I just want to finish some quests up. Other times I head out to my boat and sail around seeing what's on those little islands. You can go and try to find cards you need for your decks. In-between I spend time updating my stronghold. I haven't even looked into the rapport system yet but that's another thing. There is a lot of content and it seems like no matter what you end up doing you are gaining in some way.
        I’m tryin mg to do this too! Don’t want to get sucked in to all these endless guides. Question: how do you upgrade your lab? And other stuff in the stronghold
            I think if you hit management you just choose from that menu. You need the materials from logging, mining, and foraging. I haven't gotten too deep into it but just have been starting upgrades as I have the mats for them. They all take real life time to complete so I just start them before I log off for the night.
            You gotta get to level 15 stronghold to get level 3 Lab I think if that's what you're after
                Ah ok thanks
                    You can check by selecting the drop-downs at the top of the "lab" "workshop" etc sections.

Switch it from "available" to "all" to see all the future things you can upgrade and it'll tell you what you need to unlock it.
            farm xp by 1.) getting ore and lumber, 2.) get a blueprint for something that costs silver, ore & lumber in the workshop to build and gives decent stronghold xp, 3.) spam build it.  And while you are doing that, send out crews on dispatch missions whenever possible.
        Yea this has more-or-less been my approach thus far, too. I just always find myself getting caught up in worrying that I will waste valuable resources or do something irredeemably regretful. Trying to get past that hurdle but I'm otherwise having fun just being bad and learning to be less bad through playing.
    If you want to play free its a LOT of work. This game has longevity and a lot of stuff to do right out the gate because its an already established game. TBH play at your pace and your pace only to not overwhelm or burn yourself out.
        How much money do you need to spend if you don’t want to play free?
            Even if you don't spend money, there is no problem playing the game. Most in-game functions can be solved with weekly reward gold. If you feel it's cheaper to use cash than to consume gold, you can use cash.
            I actually don't know and really don't want to know. I would say it would be quite costly since theres some form of RNG mechanics to even spending. Minus gear progression/buffs/workshop strongholds. The whole card collecting thing is whole nother level of spending.
    There’s no need to follow guides if you’re happy with how you’re doing. The only really mandatory tip is not to waste selection chests  until you know what they’re for and why you’d want the things in them. Everything else can be googled when you’re confused or stuck. 

That said, as someone who wants to do endgame but is very easily overwhelmed, this guide was a lifesaver since it helps make activity priority clearer. The game throws a lot at you starting when you get to North Vern.
    Don't worry I've spent  30 to the 40 hours in the spots he said should take 10 haha
    You don’t have to know everything off the bat. Maybe try having fun first, the learning will come.
    It almost feels like those asian mobile mmo with the autoplay function, since there is, in fact, a “path” you gotta follow.

Not saying I’m not enjoying the game tho. Cleared 50 hours. Probably won’t clear the 500 hours tho
"Knowledge transfer = free power pass (gold consumption) function added"

You can get a power pass outside of the 2 free ones ???
    So it's basically a power level you pay for with silver and time. I think we get access at 52 or so.
        No. You get access at 50 when you hit 302 ilvl and finish vern.
        It will skip an alt to level 50, it works the same as the vern pass no?
            yes and it requires at least 600g. the further you progress the higher the gold cost becomes but you can skip closer to your highest characters content. you have a maximum of 9 of these to use on your account
                Anything higher than vern for knowledge transfer is a waste. First your alt needs to already have 460 gear to skip to rohendel otherwise you cant use it. You pay 1k gold to skip 1 hour of questing. It doesnt give gear unless its the first KT which gives 302.
                    did not know that. I honestly thought it was similar to a power pass item that you can choose which storyline you want to progress to
                        Yeah its weird. I have no idea why anyone would skip an hour of questing for 1k gold. You also have to wait way more than 1 hour to level it up anyway.
                            Right now its useless but down the line when the new classes get released and Gold is becoming slowly worthless cuz theres so much around its worth more paying 1k to save 1hr of time. Especially if you want to play like 2-3 new characters. Thats why on my alt im hoarding fragments
                            So rohendel one doesn’t even give you ilevel 460 gears?
                                Nope. You need to HAVE 460 to even do the transfer.
                    so don't do shushire? if i want to stay at 600g?
                        Nah I think it skips shushire too. You just choose the first knowledge transfer out of a couple options. It doesnt force you on a specific tier so dont worry. You choose.
            You get the set of 302 gear but that is it, no consumables like the power pass. Also it costs 600 gold
        You have to finish Vern and pay 600 gold.
            The gold cost starts at 600, but you can knowledge transfer to higher tiers for more gold once your main hits certain ilvl and story breakpoints.
                Also true, but seldom worth it beyond Vern as the alt must already meet the ilvl requirement for the region you’re skipping.
        I thought I heard it was 600 gold, not silver?
        It costs 600 gold, not silver
    I think that's a future feature coming to NA/EU...it's basically alternate power pass. it needs some additional steps/conditions/time but it's unlimited afaik.
What do you mean by recruit trusted npc and change skins?
    It seems you can put npcs and stuff in the stronghold and buy skins for them, kinda neat
        How do you do that? I had a notifications saying thunder would like to visit but no idea how to bring her
            If you go into the place menu in your stronghold you can place NPCs. same menu you used when you had to place an item for the quest. not sure what the exact name is as I am not in-game right now.
    You can invite NPC and change clothes.

I love all the help this post provides, but my favourite part is still, "request sexy poses", it just tickles my funny bone perfectly
Man I love these because I hate watching YouTube guides. Thank you. I'm not even planning on going that ham with tw3 and elden ring coming out but still very helpful.
Wow nice
For chaos dungeon and guardian raid rest bonus, generally speaking isnt it better to do it everyday if possible? I heard that it still like 1.5X the amount. 

Also do you know what daily price of crystals in korea are? Im wondering if i should buy cyrstals here but dont know good gold price
    If you stick with the game you get a lot more gold in t3 and later content, so your gold right now is very small.

Korea blue crystal to gold is 1: 17 .  We are like 1:2 at moment.....so yes blue crystals are dirt cheal
        Does the price of blue crystal change?
            the gold price changes, the royal crystal price is constant at like 2.85 ratio
I'm level 40 and still don't know wtf I'm doing, even with all these guides the terms just alludes me and I'm left doing whatever I think is right even though deep down I know I'm fucking up
    I’m right there with you! Just waiting for that time when I’ll be kicking myself for not doing that “thing” that I should’ve been doing the whole time.
        OP mentioned not opening certain chest up until endgame, I’ve had 50 of them and already opened them 😂
Please keep posting those. Ignore the haters, don't take their dumb comments personally, This is super useful.
    thank you.
I would **not** recommend skipping side quests during *leveling* 1-50 the side quests often take you to the same area as your main quest and are a huge boost in items and xp. Nearly  no reason to skip them as they also give you roster xp. 

Rest of the guide is great. Wandering merchants have a set pattern.
I agree with this article.

I am a user who has been playing Lost Ark for 3 years. As explained above, item level is not everything. Skill points, runes, raid experience, party synergy, and equipment set options make your character stronger by various factors. 

Skill points and runes cannot be bought with money, and p2w is limited because they are collected or dropped randomly.  
  
With the equipment set option that will be released later, the character becomes stronger by 3 to 40%, and all equipment belongs to the character. (Non-tradeable, crafted item)
I feel overwhelmed lol
Is there a faster way to hop islands or are we always sailing?
    There are npcs at the ports that teleport you if you don't want to sail.
        Nice. Thank you.
    I use the bio frost and the cruise ship to get to the port/island that is closest to my destination. Really cuts down time
Thank you very much !! 

At this point we will diabetes from your kindness (つ✧ω✧)つ
>I wrote this for 5 hours just to help you.

Thank you very much. It's amazing how helpful the KR players have been with posting things here. I'm sure I speak for everyone when I say it is appreciated.
Super helpful
I wanted to say thank you for taking the time to do this for us, very kind of you. Thank you so much!

What is your take on alts and how many alts to manage to be efficient? Do you park them at 302 and just have them farm chaos + guardian raid and funnel to main?
I don't think this is just Koreans... I've followed the StarCraft scene for a long time, and I've never seen any Koreans pasting English build orders or tips on how to progress on ladder... I think the Lost Ark community just seems to be helpful, Korean or not.
what? im just playin the game bro wtf is all this
It feels so good to read a post with actual concise useful information with some fun stuff thrown in for good measure from someone who actually knows. No rambling no bullshit just to the point well done.

Thank you.
This is insanely good! Thanks a ton!
Damn I thought the guide was great and then I read

> Mococo Seed is not the most important collectible point

And now I feel personally attacked.
Great work and very helpful since Lost Ark endgame May be overwhelming. Thank you for taking the time.
Holy shit nice guide thx thx thank you!
So much to do and to learn but guys take your time! Thanks for the guide
Make sure u guys upgrade ur gear +2 evenly at a time to hit the next gearscore bracket. You can transfer ur upgrade progress on ur blue gear into the epic gear and the same for legendary gear from abyss without losing ur +. Once u hit +15 on everything and hit 600 gs to hit t2 go do yorn questline then do the 600 gs chaos dungeons. It'll drop 802 blue gear and u can transfer ur 600 t1 gear into the t2 blue 802 gear for a free +1 on every piece.
    Does the gear + stay when it’s transferred from t1 gear to t2 gear? Or does it just reset to a +1?
        When u go to t2 it starts at +0 again. U can transfer ur +15 t1 gear to t2 802 gear for a free +1.
            Wonderful, thank you very much!

Amazing guide, tyvm!
Tldr: If you want to have fun just play the game, don’t obsess over guides and don’t listen to shill streamers.
i love you lol
your humor is literally insane lol

&#x200B;

not to mention it's 100% spot on   


this is THE best guide
I have 100 hours in and nothing is worse then failing a gear honing.
Thanks for sharing. Its really usefull !
thank you for such a wholesome guide Komrade
You are the real chad of lost ark for writing this most awesome guide. Kudos
Thank you, I just logged in to thank you for ALT+D
One of the best threads known to man kind!
I just started playing and I can TELL this post is great - I just don’t understand the concepts yet. I’m gonna save it
The amount of helpful posts are the cherry on top for this lunch, despite the ques ofc. Thanks a lot !
I have no idea what I've just red, but I'm amazed.
>If you are looking for 100% fun = Skip the side quest and proceed with the main quest only

But fun for me is to do the side quests.. lol. "fun" is subjective for each person.
    [deleted]
        OP isnt telling you how to have fun, it's called a language barrier. He's simply trying to point out when the actual game starts as in where the fun begins for 90% of people. As someone who just hit T2, I can tell you they are 100% correct.

The reason you want to do things efficiently is because you eventually hit a material wall. If you dont want to be delayed indefinitely on your way to the endgame it's best to get to the point where you are honing gear and selling shit to make ends meet to get to the next tier. 

If you dont care about being stuck for a long time (possibly weeks) then go at your own pace, that's valid. Once you get to Rohendal though you'll realize what all this efficiency is for
How does the rested bonus works? Do you miss anything?  


Saw someone giving an example saying you get basically less rewards:  
1) Doing twice days 1, 2 and 3 = 6 rewards  
2) Skip days 1 and 2, do it on day 3 = only 4 rewards
    Yes you miss 1/3, but if you're limited for time, you can powerpass two alts and get double rewards every day by rotating through them. 2/3 the amount as if you did it all every day, but 2x as much as if you only had 1 character.
        Wait, sorry but I didn't get it. The rest bonus gives double rewards only for the 1st try?

So is this how it works?  
1) 1st day \[2runs\] + 2nd day \[2 runs\] = 4 runs

2) 1st day \[skip\] + 2nd day \[ (x2 on 1st) + (x1 on 2nd)\] = 3 runs

3) 1st day \[skip\] + 2nd day \[skip\] + 3rd day \[x2 on 1st + x2 on second\]= 4 runs
            It gives you essentially one "credit" per missed activity, and costs 2 credits for a double reward. So you get 4 credits on a day you don't use a character, then 4 the next day, then on the third day you use all 8 on 4 activities. 

That's my understanding at least.
                I believe you only get 1 credit for missing a day, so 2 missed days = 1.5 days of rewards in a 3 day interval. 50% loss which is fine if you're short on time and have a lot of alts.
Man I wish the lost ark EU community was as good as the Korean one... You are helpful while EU players just flame in chat once you speak in your native language... Sad
    And NA just cries about P2W and how much grind you have to do. This is why we don’t get any games.
I genuinely enjoy seeing all the help other veteran players are expressing here to us noobs. Feels kinda wholesome.
So much to do. I’m having a headache. Love this game, but I don’t want to burn out.
Korean mmo players best players.

Ya lost me here. LOL
    Does anyone actually play these games for the story?
        Koreans do. And they are prolly better than either of us lol
You are an MVP, friend! Thank you so much for putting these guides together-- good knowledge all around.

Also, TIL that I can trap my husband in a maze at my stronghold! Must learn how to do this! Ha ha!
I love you guys. Must've taken quite a while to make a post so detailed and it's greatly appreciated. Thank you for all of the great tips and guides!!!
thank you my friend..! x33
I don't know what the hell any of this means.
Nice tips!  
Here's some good videos guide for chaos dungeons too!

    Why are you here? Go eat more crayons.
how is the customer service team for lost ark has anyone had to deal with them yet? It seems I have made a major fuck up and hopeful (somewhat doubtful) hey can help..
    I mean, that depends what your fuckup was? What'd you do?
        Opened all my chests with green crystals on my main lol… I’m sitting at 46k and alt has none - so I guess it’s just keep playing my main and slowly grind on alt in daily chaos and guardians, I can’t see them being able to reverse the chest opening..
            Accept it and move on, it's not a deal breaker if you plan on playing a while
                Thanks :)
            The harmony shards?  Unless your main is past 600 ilvl you're prob gonna need those shards
                Thank you!
Did someone say sexy poses?
Nice guide.

I have one question guys. Infinite chaos dungeon on tier 2 sells blue class engraving books. Should I buy them ? Or there are enough quests that give them freely?
    I’m tier 1 ilvl 590 and I was able to get 19 blue class books through quests. I ended up buying 1 book on the market. 

If you go to maxroll website, you can search the island tab by rewards. Look for islands with the blue class reward books.
        Going to search for it then. Thanks !
It was bound to happen
Absolutely stellar guide ! Thank you so much !
I don't know what I'm looking at here as a new player, but I know that I should probably save this thread
”Trap ypur friends in a maze” 

true endgame.
God damn it !!! Thank you bud!
what item level you suggest for my alts guys? i heard 340 but not sure
    Ive seen a lot of people suggest getting an alt to 420 asap so you can clear the first 24 levels of tower on them to get lots of enhancement materials.
Thank you very much for sharing
How bad is Special Dispatch compared to just doing the guardian raid?
Why is it more fun to just do the main quest and not any of the side quests?
    well they also seem to think its more fun to not skip cut scenes when I personally find the main story character dialogue to be really cringey lol (at least in english)
Thank you for this.
Event cutscene?
I'll be referring to this for weeks.  Thank you very much.
Wow thats a lot of information!  Thanks :)
What's the best way to collect class engraving books?   


I'm not so much worried about leveling from 1 to 3, but how do I get level 1 engravings on my alts (boosted by Powerpass)
Thanks, this is helpful, will save it!
I just got my ship and I'm level 41 lol. Seems like I am over leveled based on this guide
Thanks man!
Thanks for taking the time making this guide , now if only i could get online and play the game to use the guide that would be nice.
Be grateful to our oppas and noonas!
Thank you so much for the guide! Glad to see so many korean friends dropping knowledge
So many mistakes in these tips.. sigh
Ward. Thank you for the info!
This is such a huge help. Thank you.
isn't the west grind widly different than east, though, making this guide mostly useless?
sheeesh most of us just want to play game tho.
But I like the sidequests... they are fun...
Alternatively, just figure it out as you go along and enjoy the mystery for a bit.
I love you
You're the best, this is the first MMO that I've played for more than an hour, and I'm just trying to enjoy it without it becoming a job.
Thank you guy!
Please take my free award as a humble express of thankfulness, I don't have anything with me at the moment, your work is highly appreciated.
I don't understand how Card exp works. For example, I got lucky and droped a Wei card from a legendary card chest, so is it a good idea to buy another Wei card from a wandering merchant if I see it (for extra exp or whatever)?
Wait, theres an island with no mokokos? Brb uninstalling
This is so much information and I don't know what 2/3rds of it is, but IMMA LEARN!!! Ty for all the helpful tips. <3
Don't have the time to read all of this while taking a shit at work but I appreciate the content! Will definitely be checking this out later tonight
Thank you! We're blessed to have our Oppas and Noonas guide us.

    Same, the level cap in this game is 26 to me.
>It is recommended not to skip the event cutscene video.

I quitted Lost Ark twice because I watched the cutscene, I actually stayed this time because I just G through the whole thing.
lutera, tortoyk, annikka estimated 16 hours?  lmao im just finishing annikka and im at like 42 hours.  been doing all side quests, collecting seeds, gathering, and some stronghold stuff, but still thats a huge difference.
*me sitting at 40 hours in luterra*
Thank you for the tips! I see you put tier level on the main story. Does that mean I have to get tier 2 and tier 3 gear to proceed main story?

Commenting for later
This is confusing as fuck.
Hi just got to lvl 50 and was looking at builds to do for Taijutsu scrapper and realized I needed more skill points. So here I am trying to find quests that give skill points but what if I make an alt, do I have to redo all quests on the alt too to get all skill points?
    Pretty sure skill potions up the amount availble yo all roaster character s
So some confusing points are the terms your using such as:

Combat Level vs Battle Level - What is the difference? I have no idea as I just know my characters level?

The item tiers: Artifact Grade, Legendary Grade, Hero Grade. - Is this the item tier levels like "Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary"? AKA: Greens, Blues, Purples and Oranges. Some games have the elusive Reds and I've got no idea what they call that...
How about No . I’m just gonna log in and play just pvp and go sleep , why do any  pve in this game it’s so fucking convoluted and feels like a day job
    Some people enjoy things you may not enjoy
I'm just gonna play for fun....
Can or should this be a pinned to the channel?
This is amazing, thank you!
I just saved this on Wayback Machine just in case its ever deleted for whatever reason
"Hello, I am a korean user who have been playing lost ark for 3 years..."

-God
Wait what? I didn't get a stronghold and I'm almost level 30. Did I goof somewhere?
    nah.  You get it after you clear Luterra Castle.  You ought to be mid 30s when that happens, maybe less if you are rushing through and only doing the main quests, maybe as high as 38 if you are being very methodical.
Item dictionary just blew my mind all over my face... ty!
This was incredible. Thanks so much for the hard work. MVP material. ❤
Hello, here is some free advice.

Typically Reddit:  stfu you nerd! REEEEEeeeEeeEee!!!!.
Everyone here: thanks fam, we love you forever
My problem currently with Lost Ark is , I went too far on the map, I went to vernas castle but im lvl 42 and lol quest wants 50 for some shit, now I have to sail back I guess.
How do you "(Check the quests that can acquire runes and skill points in the item dictionary)"?
I’m having trouble with the sailing missions at the stronghold. All of my missions range from 4-60% chance of success. Is this normal? Have I skipped something (or not unlocked it yet) that would help me with this?
Thank you for taking the time to write this up. As someone that's just reached Vern and unlocked a lot of the end-game content, this is quite a useful post.

Now I just need to decide if I want to progress with my Artillerist or PowerPass my War Dancer / Sorceress and go with either of those.
Tldr?
    Jk...There?... stuff
What is shillings?
    Silver
This moght be just me, but as a challeged I  speedran all of luterra uo to the first ark and my play time (skipping cutscenes and dialogue) was about 5 hours
Fuck this shit can get complicated!
ill be busy the next 2 days and cant play.  
the rest system is so great for busy people like me.  
awesome game.   
i overplayed during launch but i found it much better to play only an hr or two a day.
This is crazy useful and I have a feeling that I'm gonna come back to this a bunch of time once I get deeper into the game. Thanks a ton for making this!
I had no idea about the compass thing.  Yikes!
Good post OP

Please share kimchi recipes i am making Maangchi's and go through 3 pounds of it a week at least korean food the best

Thanks for taking the time u/luckystart1 its really appreciated, I do have one question I was hoping you could help me out with. I posted this on another thread, but I was wondering if you know how far behind the JP servers are, currently we just got Biackiss and Kungelanium. In March we are gonna get Hell Biackiss and Valtan. 2nd Quarter the Japanese site says we'll get Cook Seiton (クークセイトン) .

Does that put us like 6 months behind? I think I read on some LOA site that translated the KR patch notes from July 2021 something about Hell Biackiss.

If Cook Saton is updated on the Japanese server now, I think the difference with the Korean server is the 4th region Commander Raid, the Lowen Continent, and some convenience updates and events.
        Thank you so much for the reply, been trying to figure out where the JP servers stand, kind of difficult to see a comparison between them all, especially considering you can't play outside of ones region, it would be nice to know where we all stand compared to the base game (KR). Thank you again
IS there a compilation of all these tips and tricks from Korean lost ark gamers?
Doot.
I am so confused lmfao I'm doomed.
how can I have the roster help research at strong hold?? I don't see it in my stronghold (
    If a specific research cannot be found, it may be for one of the following reasons:

1. Lack of stronghold level
2. Lack of Item Level
3. Stronghold quest not progressing
4. Unable to acquire adventure book rewards
I have a question, does the story ever get ANY better?? I'm nearing the end of Tier 1 story and I've paid attention to every cutscene, read all of the dialogue (main and side quests), and the storytelling and worldbuilding is atrocious. It is so, so bad.

Like is it just the localization that made it terrible? Was it this bad in South Korea?

Satisfaction with stories varies from person to person. However, if you are strict about story narratives, the only satisfactory stories in Lost Ark are Lowen Continents, Feiton Continents, and some islands. Criticism of Lost Ark's story quality exists a lot in Korea, including myself.
I see alot of these things about affinity, and I've been doing them, but I keep getting this popup that says must complete previous rapport quest or whatever, but I've done all the quests... what do I do here? i have over 150 of every secondary stat so i dont know if thats it

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;Either of the following:
1. Bug Error = Report to Amazon
2. When NPC affinity is performed with another character = Play as that character
3. Lack of propensity points = Satisfying propensity points
4. Press the J key to check if there are any NPC affinity quests that have not been completed
5. Others, etc.
Traps... Sexy poses... Friends... Mah man.

If we only have like 1 - 2 hours a day to play due to wife, kids, work, queues etc and are still only levelling - like say i am only lvl 25 is there any daily activities we should already be doing or do we only start targeting daily activities once we reach 50? I only ask because it will still be a long time before I even hit lvl 50..

The guide I wrote is still incomplete. I'm going to write until all players' curiosity is gone. Currently, the Amazon server has not officially released a proper Tier 3 endgame. Lost Ark is a game that can only be completed with Abyss Raid and Legion Commander Raid. So, until then, proceed with the main story quest. Whenever the progress of the main story quest is blocked, you can play the endgame and raise the item level. And when you have time, you can collect runes and skill points. For now, that's all. Of course, you can also do activities to collect gold, silver coins (shillings), and various other materials as bonuses, but these are covered in detail in this guide.
The more I read about the upcoming grind, the less I want to continue playing tbh. This feels like an 80 hour workweek with no breaks.

Side quests that occur after clearing the main quest can be ignored. (Excluding Feiton, Punica, and Bern Southern Continents).

Is there particular reason for this or just rewards are meh?

Thanks!
my questions that i dont see anywhere is, where do you actualy get hero/epic/purple  class engraving books? is there any quests or they all need to be farmed?
I didn’t understand a thing from this post, but it feels it will get more clear in endgame
How important are the cards?
    Cards aren't terribly the most important, but they're nice to have. Cards help with convenience, DPS, and survivability.

Best way to spend blue crystals?
at ilvl460, should I focus on skill points / giant hearts una tasks or keep farming mats ?
    Concentrate on main quests and item leveling to progress to the next tier. Then, if you have time, you can do the rest of the activities such as collecting runes and skill points. Or you can do both at the same time. Ultimately, the choice is yours. Details will be supplemented as the guide is revised.

        I read that and immediately thought of my horror themed animal crossing death maze. 

God imma do that again.
            video or it didnt happen :P
        That’s so evil, I love it
    Maze was the first thing i tryed to start making but i lack the space to trap some 2 inside it.
Trust = sexy pose
How does this work?
Yeah I even set this post to favorites. It will help us immense
I don’t get why Rohandel is listed as tier 2 yet gives t1 mats and is unlocked 140 item levels below tier 2.
    How do you get to tier 2 lmao

It's not by not going to rohendel
I hit Level 50 yesterday, I read the guide twice and I'm sure it's really helpful but it feels like it is written in some old runic language because I have absolutely no idea how that could help me figuring out the lvl 50+ gameplay.
    This gearing guide by maxroll is pretty good https://lost-ark.maxroll.gg/resources/road-to-rohendel
        Even this is kinda nuts.
            To be fair thats the "speedrun to t3" guide they have a post level 50 one which is less intense, at that point in the game those systems become clearer though.

            One step at a time dude. All that guide really is doing is walking you through where to collect quests and complete them with an order to save you time.
            Ooops I linked the speedrun one, this is the less intense guide
https://lost-ark.maxroll.gg/resources/post-50-guide
        >My god I can't read that font for my life.
    I hit level 50 today and I am still confused about how to do dailies at least.
    There is a lot here that is translated with slightly different names, so unless you know the system already you won't know which system they are talking about :(

Lots of video and other guide on YouTube and maxroll though
For real. I’m only level 21 so obviously I’m not going to understand a lot, but every guide I see leaves me more confused than I started. Can’t wait to play more though.
    Honestly just play the game...I'm a 46 and the more I read this shit the less it makes me want to play the game.  Just wanna put together some combos and get yelled at for not being good enough
        Best tip, is to just play and experience it for yourself. Try to save valuable items and currency until you know what you are doing. Rule of thumb: green stuff can be used however you feel like. Save blue/purple/orange items until you understand their effects.
    All you need to know is basically.

Finish main story. (should happen around lvl 40)

Finish "blue colored" quests (it is your new main story) until it gives you a chest that contains a full 301 item-leveled armor set. (will happen some time after you hit lvl 50)
    >every guide I see leaves me more confused than I started.



Lmao, nailed it. I actually have trepidation before reading guides now.



"Hmm.. This may hurt me."
You don’t need to know everything right now. MMO’s are long term games, you slowly learn everything
I felt this way when I started playing path of exile. I now have (only) 600 hours in that and still only scratched the surface in regards to content. Lost ark seems 10 times as complex and has infinitely more content. Glad I picked it up though, I’m loving it so far.
    Trust me. In terms of complexity and ITEMIZATION POE is on whole other level.
    Sorry, what? You need a guide twice as long as this one for an *introduction* into some of the mechanics in PoE. I'm not saying that makes it a better game or anything but the sheer complexity of it is absolutely absurd.
        You might be right, maybe I’m just used to it now after a few leagues and tons of builds. The newness of lost ark just has my brain scrambled with all the intertwining layers of quests and mats and other stuff lol
    I played poe since closed beta. It went for diablo style to idek what I'd call the mish mosh it is today. Way to many mechanics and what not it actually drove me to quit after 8years. PoE too much was much simpler and fun before maps were introduced
        I started playing during ritual league but it seems like every league they change a ton of core mechanics, changing skills, tons of nerfs and just killing a lot of good builds. I was getting tired of spending so much time on a build just to have it completely ruined next league.
These guides are nice to know but you really dont need to read any of these things to enjoy the game and do well. Sure theres some noob traps but for the most part just do what interests you as you go through the story. Then you can come back to these kinds of guides and resources when you're stuck.
Just felt this way to. Kudos to the guy helping us with the guide but i dont know what the guide is trying to teach me 80% of the time
This is anecdotal and may be a broad generalization but the few Korean friends I have that moved here at a young age are very organized and methodical with everything they do so I assume a lot of Korean gamers have tons of helpful content like this they just need to copy and paste.
    Koreans are the best gamers - it is known.
        Japanese: oh thank goodness the weirdos moved onto a new Asian country to worship.
            Japan were considered gods of fighting games for a long time, Koreans were the gods of RTS since Starcraft and then League of Legends, which isn't really an RTS but controls similar to one.  It's a shame Dota 2 never really took off in Korea.
                Sports/competiton is all about structure, organization and support and then critical mass. The best gamers come from communities where there's plenty of people who help others achieve those competitive goals, something that Korean starcraft players had an advantage in, and Japanese FGC players had for fighting games. 

Its like olympics, more people and more money and more interest = better players once enough time has passed.

            Have you been living under a rock?
                I'm making a joke about the increase in koreaboos. It's not that deep.
            *Koreaboos
I think some of it has to do with most games requiring you to use your social security number just to create an account, don't know if it's still like this today but when I was younger I had to ask my family in Korea to give me their SSN so I could play some games. It keeps the behaviors in line.
Why is there ~20 hours of main quest? I couldn't get past lv 40 because all you do is walk around clicking and doing pointless dungeons where gear/skills/deaths don't matter.

Does the game get better after 50 or I'm looking at another 12 hours of this?
    Leveling is kinda boring but when you get to lvl 50 and finish castle vern storyline, you willa have almost all t1 endgame unlocked. That means your gameplay changes from 50/50 walking talking/fighting into 20/80 sailinig/fighting. It took me around 25 hours of total gameplay for the first time to get there ;)
        25 hours to reach level 50, or 25 hours total?
            Probably to reach 50. But that's not even an issue this is an MMO. It would take thousands upon thousands of hours to "beat" this game. By the time you would "beat" it there would be more and more content to do.
                > thousands of hours to "beat" this game.

of course, that's not an issue. My issue was the game so far has been a devil may cry/god of war instead of an mmorpg
                    Ah I see. I think that is just typical MMO behavior right? At least in this day and age of MMOs. You level up and quest and basically play story mode or co-op story mode until you get to end game and reveal the rest of the game.
    I've felt like I've been on crazy pills. Everyone is hailing this as the best MMO they've ever played (minus the launch and server issues), meanwhile I'm roaming around the most linear questing I've ever done in an MMO, spamming G, listening to bad voice acting and boring cut scenes in an ultra generic story that can't pick even a handful of themes to stick with. I literally just fought an army of clowns and suddenly I'm on a pirate ship and then I'm in "Honey, I Shrunk The Kids". I have thematic whiplash. Meanwhile, I take out my electric guitar to teleport to town, and never put my pistols away while I gesture wildly to NPCs, waving my guns in  their face.

I keep holding out hope that the end-game will reel me in, because both me and my buddy I'm leveling with feel like we're losing our minds. I understand the game isn't going to be for everyone, but I have a lot of MMO experience in general from way back in Ultima Online and EQ, and years in WoW, Rift, GW2, FFXIV, TERA, and more... this has been the dullest experience I've ever had from start to end-game to date.

I walked in with high hopes since I love the idea of an MMO mixed with an ARPG, since those are two of my favorite genres, and we both feel that the combat has been great, but everything else has been so lackluster for us.
        This game is ALL about end game. Theres a reason you get 2 free lvl 50 boosts once you compete MSQ. Theres a reason you can use 600g to power boost up to 9 toons. The Devs are confidant that their endgame is what keeps ppl playing. I agree that the leveling was boring....but you do it once and never have to do it again unless you want to. I hate leveling in every MMO ive ever played tbh. Im an end game person.
            Great, thanks, that's comforting to hear at least. I only knew about the 2 boosts and not the other stuff, so that's even better. Appreciate the info!
        >I literally just fought an army of clowns and suddenly I'm on a pirate ship and then I'm in "Honey, I Shrunk The Kids". I have thematic whiplash. Meanwhile, I take out my electric guitar to teleport to town, and never put my pistols away while I gesture wildly to NPCs, waving my guns in  their face.

This sounds like quite a phenomenal time. Sorry you don't enjoy the game!
            Yeah its a blast to me and this description is hilarious lol.
            Kokomos, when will they learn?
        >years in WoW, Rift, GW2, FFXIV, TERA, and more…

I feel like I’m the one who’s on crazy pills when I read comments like this one.

I didn’t play Rift, but I played all those others, and I find the leveling in Lost Ark to be EXACTLY the same experience except Lost Ark’s combat is fun.

Of those you listed, Tera is the only one that’s fun to play on a gameplay level before endgame. All the others are not only the exact same endless chain of fetch quests as Lost Ark, but tied to a zero-gameplay combat system.

WoW - pick enemy, quote numbers at each other, the one who quoted the higher numbers wins. Leveling in Shadowlands was far more miserable than leveling in Lost Ark, especially if you want to talk about bad story.

FFXIV - I feel like when people talk about leveling in FFXIV they forget that ARR is just a series of fetch quests broken up by exposition. It’s all setup for the story to start in Heavensward.

Point is, I find my leveling experience in Lost Ark to be an exact 1 to 1 match for my leveling experience in every single other MMO.

Except the combat is fun.

And then you get to endgame content, which is fun to do, just like in every other MMO.

I really don’t understand how other long-term MMO fans have any kind of problem with Lost Ark. I feel like we would have collectively built up a tolerance for this sort of thing by now.
            Yeah Lost Ark is one of the few games where I get off my mount to fight random shit because combat is just so fun.
                Seeing so many people talk about how fun the combat is, even while leveling,  makes me wonder if I chose the wrong class.  I'm playing as a berserker and still leveling, and so far 90% of combat is walking up to a pack of mobs and pressing 1 or 2 buttons to delete everything, which is cool the first few times but not super engaging, imo. Hoping to have the time to grind through the rest of the leveling this weekend so I can unlock some of the endgame content and hopefully understand the hype.
                    Oh man you should go make new characters and use the class tester to try out a bunch of specs. I think warrior and mage are the most boring classes.

Gunslinger, deathblade, scrapper, sharpshooter, all are really fun with interesting combos - esp deathblade.
                        Good call, I'll try out a few more while I grind my way towards the power pass. Gunslinger and Deathblade definitely look interesting, and I'm most excited for when lancemaster comes eventually.
                            Ooh I didn't know more were coming. Yeah I want to get the power pass too so I can have the other classes on this server. But apparently u have to complete the main story after 50 which may take a while.
                    Honestly mayhem berserker is mostly just like 2 buttons. Once you unlock the power pass I’d look into some of the more complex gameplay classes
                        Good to know I'm not the only one who feels that way, wish I'd put more thought into my class selection beyond just going for the big sword. Looking forward to getting the power pass to try other classes.
            Thank god, I thought I was going crazy. How are there all these comments about leveling with the “I’ve play xyz MMO” comments but then basically show you’ve never played those games at all? Or maybe they’ve got a giant hate boner for this game? Idk this is such a standard mmo with a semi boring grind to max level where the real game starts.
            Exactly this. If you dont like boring leveling process maybe dont play theme park mmos? This is sort of what the leveling process is. A running and dialogue simulator with some skill usage on enemies that are designed for anyone to be able to kill. 

Lost ark just actually makes the last part fun. Lost ark also has a ton of content for casuals and a ton of progression for die hards. This is a really really really good mmo and it is possible that maybe the genre just isnt for you anymore.
            I disagree, I found guild wars 2 was pretty unique and pretty fun to level in. It has a pretty unique system that does a good job embracing multiplayer. I also really enjoy lost ark though so I agree with most everything else you said.
                The thing that made leveling in GW2 was the number of "Oh what's that?!" things around  - jump puzzles, vistas, collectibles, area events, etc. to just jump in on to get rid of the monotony of "My child is dying, please go kill 14 Skilabundoos for their venom sacs to make this potion".

Lost Arks has a bit of those with there being a bunch of collectibles/vistas/looking out for the world bosses but GW2 had a TON of them.
                    I agree. I’m not crazy about the story in GW2, but the exploration is fantastic.
            I guess I valued the quality of the cut scenes/dialogue/story to reel me in rather than only the combat. Rift was my favorite of the ones I listed because the zones were more interactive and changing, with invasions and rifts popping up that you'd have to deal with. GW2 was also fun to level since you could literally do whatever you wanted and level up, with an emphasis on exploring and PVP and such. ESO was another favorite (I forgot to list specifically), since the zones are so beautiful, and most of the quests are actual lines with a story and characters with real voice acting, and choices that matter. TERA was also lovely in terms of how beautiful it was and how engaging the combat was. I didn't hate WoW, it was very fetch-y and required so much time running around from zone to zone, but still the quality of the game and the cut scenes and the story (up until a certain point) was enough to keep me going.

Combat alone \*is\* enough to keep me going, but the questing in Lost Ark is much less combat than it is carrying barrels, talking to someone 3 feet away from someone else and then going back and talking to them, and running from point A to point B. Even when there is combat, generally speaking it's "kill these 3 mobs, even though there's 20 there" and then you walk up and 1-shot them and walk back and talk for another 2 minutes.
                >	I guess I valued the quality of the cut scenes/dialogue/story to reel me in rather than only the combat.

Yeah, that makes sense to me.

I can put up with lackluster combat if the story is good, or vice-versa. But I can see how if you want the story to make you invested in the gameplay, Lost Ark would be a hard sell.

The story gets a little better after North Vern, mainly because (for the most part) NPCs stop showing up after the boss fight and “saving” you from a fight you just won. Also, there are some cool characters and set pieces in Rohendel and Yorn.

But I find it’s Guardian Raids and Abyssal Dungeons that are keeping me engaged.
                    Yeah, it's hearing about those dungeons/raids and seeing some of the video of combat and mechanics from those that are mainly the push for me to keep going. I'm optimistic I'll enjoy that part of the game a lot more. Thanks for taking the time to share the info and your experience! Hopefully I'll be starting that content within a few days here. Hearing all of you reply is motivating to keep pushing through.
                > I didn't hate WoW, it was very fetch-y and required so much time running around from zone to zone, but still the quality of the game and the cut scenes and the story (up until a certain point) was enough to keep me going.

This wow experience is extremely foreign to me and makes absolutely no sense to me. WoW has basically zero cutscenes till somewhere around Legion. Mists and a couple others have a few here or there, but vanilla wow has like the intro cinematic and basically nothing else.

Maybe you came to wow after leveling got totally gimped, but vanillas leveling game play was basically 10 days /played with basically no cutscenes, and reading thousands of walls of text from quest givers for your story. No cutscenes, no story explanation, barely any dialogue, just lots of fetching and reading.

GW I kinda understand your perspective one but GW has always had a great leveling/world experience. FFXIV is kind of all over the place as well, but does have a few cutscenes tying it back together, but I generally found that way more dry and even less compelling than Lost Ark. The rest of your list I don't really understand as LA just feels better... Didn't play rift though.

But compare it to any of the previous gen mmos like WOW at least through WOTLK or EVE, or even further into classics like OSRS, UO, EQ, etc and this is just no comparison IMO. This opinion screams to me of more modern theme park mmo experience instead of anything else.
                    Came here to say that what you just wrote about wow. As someone who turned to wow vanilla servers as soon as Nostalrius launched and never looked back at retail, i was so confused with his take on wow
                        Yeah this is a huge "problem" with discussions about WoW IMO. WoW in 2006 vs 2009 vs 2012 vs 2018 are all entirely different games. Claiming you've "played a lot of wow" is kind of meaningless because we could be talking about like 8 different iterations of the game.

Cinematics and a "story" are parts of modern WoW that did exist for the first third of its lifetime. Comparing WoW in the past few years to LA is very different than comparing vanilla to LA.
                            You're right, I didn't play vanilla. I should have been more specific.
        Can confirm, questing is boring as fuck. Spamming g all day also kinda hurts my hand after a while. Wish they'd just let you hold g instead

But after that the game is super fun. Everything from guardian raids, abyss dungeons, to even solo tower challenges. You can get into sailing stuff, do world bosses, and all kinds of other things. End game is packed with a variety of great content that made the main quest worth doing
            You can mouse click instead of g spamming for quests, only need g to accept rewards or accept the quest.
                I've been doing that, too. I've been trying not to spam my way through all the dialogue and cut scenes since I've been holding out some hope with them, but I mean more like "move this barrel" -> G -> climb this rope! -> G -> ride this zipline! -> G -> talk to this person! -> G -> pull this lever! -> G -> Nod at this person! -> G... oh, /nod  


I guess I click some of them, too, but still.
            Thanks, I'll keep chugging along then and continue holding out hope!
                I'm sure people told you already, but just in case, rushing through the main story quests definitely gets you there fastest. You can ignore everything else if you want
                    I've heard both, I had some other friends telling me not to skip it or I'd have to go back, but then I keep reading that I can ignore all side quest stuff entirely. We're level 43 now, so it won't be that much longer I guess, we're just having trouble staying motivated, and put off playing the last few days as a result. Hoping to hit 50 and start the end-game stuff this weekend, at least. Thanks for the info. :)
                        The side quests are completely optional. You don't ever need to go back and do them unless you just want to lol. There may be a select few you'll want the rewards from later, but the majority aren't necessary. Either way, good luck
                            That's good to know, I may skip the rest and just push the main quest to finish the story. I appreciate all the info, thanks for taking the time!
                Also of note, you don't really ever need to do the main quest line again.  You get 2 power passes which let you take alts to 50 instantly and then you can spend gold to exchange knowledge in your stronghold to skip the quest for more alts.  So it isn't like you have to slog through that story over and over.
                    I did hear about that! I'm thankful for that, since I've been intrigued by the Bard and also want to play a melee character at some point, but the idea of getting from 1-50 again manually is especially daunting at the moment. Appreciate the info!
        it sounds like you're around tortoyk so far? my friends and i were also pretty bored leveling, although we haven't played mmos and have little to compare to. it's picked up since we finished Vern - chaos dungeons are fun, and have the path of exile mapping feel, and guardian raids were the first thing that felt challenging and interactive, with lots of attack patterns to dodge or counterattack (and good lord when i got hulked the first time by a boss...i feel bad for loki now)

but then i went into an abyssal dungeon with a few friends and wiped several times in a row, and oddly, that's what got me hooked. we figured out the attack patterns, how to deal with the wipe mechanics, and it felt like an accomplishment, and what i look forward to most going forwards. 

unfortunately, unless i missed something, it seems like we can only clear once a week, i.e. if we have other friends or guildmates struggling with the dungeon, we can't help sherpa them.
            What you described is exactly what I went into the game hoping for. An ARPG-feel with MMO bossing mehcanics and dungeon/raiding parties. I love a good grind, I just found the game difficult to get into thus far and keep hoping for some more meat to sink my teeth into.
        If you feel like the combat is good, and it’s enough for you to stick to a game, the game does indeed get much better at 50 in my opinion

If you can stick it out until 420 gear score and try the 4th guardian raid, that’s when the game really clicked for me. Prior to that, the enemies were super easy and I could see it getting boring after a few weeks. 

What sucks is that it’s behind level 50, and doing a chain of side quests for roughly 2 hours hopping between islands. 

Another thing would be the abyss dungeons at 340 but I went into it and got placed with some 500 gear score people so I didn’t even see any of the major mechanics of the fights. They killed the bosses way too quickly, and it wasn’t fun. The second time I ran it, my group wasn’t nearly as geared and it would have been another time that the game would have clicked, I had a blast and a good sense of accomplishment 

If you don’t love the combat too much, the game probably isn’t for you imo
            The combat has been the saving grace for me so far, I like the class I'm playing and swapping between the bars and cooldowns, and being mobile and whatnot. I'm hoping once the endgame picks up I'll get to focus more on that and less on the tedious stuff. I don't mind a grind, I have thousands of hours in PoE and the Diablo series, I'm used to it, but those games are all combat which makes the leveling feel better.  


I'll stick with it, thanks. :)
        The 'themes' you are referring to are entirely different regions of the game. It's not all castles and knights on every single continent. 


Thankfully, unlike all those other games mentioned, you really only have to level up once, which to me is a massive upgrade (having played the intro for all those games multiple times). Knowledge transfer in your Stronghold can automatically bring up a new character to the same progress as your main. Though most recommend at least getting to Tier 2 first before using it.
            >Knowledge transfer in your Stronghold can automatically bring up a new character to the same progress as your main. Though most recommend at least getting to Tier 2 first before using it.

That's great to know, thank you!
        yeah I'm on the same boat here. Don't know why they locked the game content behind a 20 hour grind. Even in new world I had fun right off the first levels
        IDK. The quests for me have been "Its so bad its good" in a crack fueled hallucinogenic sort of way. But for me the draw is breadth, depth - and perhaps mostly importantly - game feel.


I played all those games too, from Ultima to Aion and etc...  A lot of games I really loved and still love in a nostalgic sense. And all of them are flawed in some way. Ultima in hindsight is a clunky mess in a generic medieval world. Dark Ages of Camelot is an utter slog which for most of the tenure of its better days was a directionless snoozefest that exceled in some ways.


I can't think of an MMO that has ever had a story that really pulled me in with the exception of Warcraft but only because of childhood nostalgia for Orcs vs Humans.


The absurdities of Lost Ark are amusing for me in their own ways. The utter laziness of these NPCs to pay me to move something 5 feet, or to have a dwarf sit in my pocket while I play music for eggs and rocks... Honestly its a relief to not have to give a fuck about it all lmao.


 A lot of these other MMOs took themselves way too seriously when their story was equally unworthy of being read. I spam G and I'm pretty sure I know the majority of whats going on in Lost Ark and its an utterly goofy mess that is The Room levels of awful entertainment.


But yeah. Really its the breadth of the world and the game feel that are doing it for me right now. I laughed at your comment about the clown army which was followed closely by a really heavy holy inquisition and then I was trying to get a boat and hanging out with pirates. Lmao. 10 hours or so later and I havent even heard about Armen again - perhaps for the best. If I had my choice, Mokamoka would be my sidekick forever though.
            Yeah, the feel of the combat and such, and some of the little boss fights we've done is literally the only thread we're holding onto right now, but it's enough to keep us gently pushing through the game hoping to get into that grind at the end with the majority of the game hopefully being combat instead of moving leaves and barrells and fertilizer around lol  


We're certainly viewing it all as absurd in terms of the story/questing, but I think we lost the humor in it along the way, and just want to fight things.
        So much this. Glad I'm not alone.
        You're a fuckin nutjob bro, all that shit you just said sounds amazing.
        My main group played since the 8th and have been doing daily guardian raids and abyss dungeons and it’s been a blast. My other friend decided to join a little late and NO ONE wanted to redo the campaign. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!! 😂

                I can't think of an MMO where leveling isn't ultra easy.  Pretty much all of them are auto pilot going from place to place and collecting boxes/feathers/bugs/whatever this NPC needs for their mid-life crisis.

                        Imagine an arpg style game where if you pulled too many mobs you died. This is not a game many people would want to play as an mmo (could be good roguelike though!).

                                What endgame scenario punishes you for pulling multiple trash mobs again?
                        While I agree you certainly can't grab nearly as many mobs in WoW as you do in LA, outside of classic which is a balancing nightmare you could grab entire camps and burn them down EASILY.

The only time you really die leveling in WoW is if you go AFK and aggro something.
        Well that's what the power pass for finishing Vern is for along with the knowledge transfer at your stronghold. I have 2 alts that I'm gonna boost
            [deleted]
                Well yeah once. Luckily you're not forced to play the game.  I assume.
    game gets much better, there are dungeons in which many mobs spawns and you need to mass kill, pretty satisfying imo and there are a lot of bosses/raids, bosses are 100% skill and after you advance 1-2 wiping mechanics appear. You still have plenty of G clicking tho, you need to complete your main quest (ignore all secondary quests) and after that look for the isles guide, pretty boring but it's the fastest path to upgrade.
    There was a point around level 35 to 40 that fell flat for me, but once you reach the final area of Luterra, you see the horizon, get your ship, and the game blows open from there.
    The dungeons are fun. The visuals were pretty great. I hate the quests too, but I really enjoy my time with the scenery, dungeons and field bosses.
    i was alredy happy with PVP and got to 50 and did some end game just to try it out and i cant put it down and haven played pvp in like 3 days, the end game is sooo much, especially abysals
[deleted]
    So don't read it? What a stupid take.
    Then ignore their tips? This game is incredibly overwhelming to begin with, having tips and guides to help newer players along is only helpful. It’s up to you to ignore it if you want to play through an MMO blind. 

It’s funny you speak like there’s only one way to play MMOs, let others play the way they want.
        I honestly don't understand why people find this game overwhelming.... Maybe it's because people are blazing through it to get to level 50 and not actually playing the game to learn what is happening as you progress....
Yup. You know it right. Wandering merchant appears in a certain logic. Also as a same KR user just like the writer, I feel a lot of information he's talking is based on KR progress such as 'save your battle item'. Especially 'how to enjoy' part. Each user has a different goal, different taste and it's funny to tell them the right way.

        There can be more than one merchant up at a time, but not every merchant is guaranteed to spawn.
Is the wei card name the same? Or is the name diff in the english version?
    Same
I think you can read this article when you're worried about what to do now after doing everything.
    Ya i think its too early for me to involving myself with all those.. stuff
Yep. They're quick; they're literally all in the exact same areas as the main line almost constantly overlapping those quests; they provide new players (which all of us are unless we hopped on RU/KR servers) with useful items, extra experience, and practice with our skills and builds, as well as the game's lore if there's any interest in that; and they flesh out this game's world in a way that makes it more than slowly increasing numbers in a spreadsheet.

I can't get behind any of these guides saying to skip all that. I get it, it's done to push you to the end ASAP but what's the rush here? The game came out a week ago and you're ready to skip ahead to the endgame grind. And yes, it is the endgame grind. Don't buy this bullshit about "the game starting at 50". The game starts when you create your character and pick a class. You proceed through 50 levels of that game.

You can either joylessly sprint through that part so you can keep up with your favorite content creator or friends doing the same, or so you can catch up to Koreans and Russians who have been at it for far longer, but why? What's the point? Who are you trying to impress?

This isn't how we played most of our favorite MMOs coming up. It's not even how we played our favorite ARPGs. It's not what made them stand out as games we fondly remember and have this sense of nostalgia for. Stop ruining games with this weird sweaty minmaxing mentality.

Slow down and actually enjoy your time with the game, I promise you the endgame will still be there if you take a week or two to get to it instead of a day or two.
    This game was designed for the endgame to be the "main game" from the director himself - so, the game starting at 50 isn't complete bullshit. Yes, your leveling experience is very useful (especially if you know to pick up collectibles/skill points/engravings/etc) but it isn't the "game", if that makes sense.

You're projecting a lot with that "joylessly sprint" comment. Maybe that isn't how you want to play, and that's okay. Doesn't mean people it's joyless for others. 

You seem to have a rough time with the idea that people can enjoy playing the game a different way than you. I promise, you can play the game you want and they can play the game they want, and you'll both have fun.
    The point of skipping side quests , is that you get to the actual end game sooner. All those side quests are not going any where and you can do them anytime, and many of the endgame quests will be leading you back into the same areas. So while you are still under lvl 50, there are people who are 50 already, and have unlocked their dailes, and they get to knock out all their dailes and weeklies, then with the free time, they can clear the rest of the "side content". By taking it slow and doing every side quests, it will slow you down and you will be wasting daily/weekly free resources that are not available to you pre-50.
For sure it is not like other games where a side quest will have you traveling to other continents and doing god knows what. A lot of times a side quest completion will be at the very same NPC you are using for main quest completion.
Where can I check that schedule?

                        Here is a guide to complete every continent 100% I use https://www.htfgamestudio100.com/
    Can you pm me too please? <3
I heard stories of Korean players taking breaks at work just to go to a PC Cafe to pick up the Wei Card from the merchant.

It's almost comical, and you saved yourself some trouble later.
I see a lot of these "here is the path you must follow" posts and it was a turn off for me too. 

So I said fuck it I'm just going to play the game. I haven't been bored yet. I just do whatever I feel like doing and it feels like I'm progressing in the game no matter what. 

I can run chaos dungeons and guardian raids.. or sometimes I just want to finish some quests up. Other times I head out to my boat and sail around seeing what's on those little islands. You can go and try to find cards you need for your decks. In-between I spend time updating my stronghold. I haven't even looked into the rapport system yet but that's another thing. There is a lot of content and it seems like no matter what you end up doing you are gaining in some way.
    I’m tryin mg to do this too! Don’t want to get sucked in to all these endless guides. Question: how do you upgrade your lab? And other stuff in the stronghold
        I think if you hit management you just choose from that menu. You need the materials from logging, mining, and foraging. I haven't gotten too deep into it but just have been starting upgrades as I have the mats for them. They all take real life time to complete so I just start them before I log off for the night.
        You gotta get to level 15 stronghold to get level 3 Lab I think if that's what you're after
            Ah ok thanks
                You can check by selecting the drop-downs at the top of the "lab" "workshop" etc sections.

Switch it from "available" to "all" to see all the future things you can upgrade and it'll tell you what you need to unlock it.
        farm xp by 1.) getting ore and lumber, 2.) get a blueprint for something that costs silver, ore & lumber in the workshop to build and gives decent stronghold xp, 3.) spam build it.  And while you are doing that, send out crews on dispatch missions whenever possible.
    Yea this has more-or-less been my approach thus far, too. I just always find myself getting caught up in worrying that I will waste valuable resources or do something irredeemably regretful. Trying to get past that hurdle but I'm otherwise having fun just being bad and learning to be less bad through playing.
If you want to play free its a LOT of work. This game has longevity and a lot of stuff to do right out the gate because its an already established game. TBH play at your pace and your pace only to not overwhelm or burn yourself out.
    How much money do you need to spend if you don’t want to play free?
        Even if you don't spend money, there is no problem playing the game. Most in-game functions can be solved with weekly reward gold. If you feel it's cheaper to use cash than to consume gold, you can use cash.
        I actually don't know and really don't want to know. I would say it would be quite costly since theres some form of RNG mechanics to even spending. Minus gear progression/buffs/workshop strongholds. The whole card collecting thing is whole nother level of spending.
There’s no need to follow guides if you’re happy with how you’re doing. The only really mandatory tip is not to waste selection chests  until you know what they’re for and why you’d want the things in them. Everything else can be googled when you’re confused or stuck. 

That said, as someone who wants to do endgame but is very easily overwhelmed, this guide was a lifesaver since it helps make activity priority clearer. The game throws a lot at you starting when you get to North Vern.
Don't worry I've spent  30 to the 40 hours in the spots he said should take 10 haha
You don’t have to know everything off the bat. Maybe try having fun first, the learning will come.
It almost feels like those asian mobile mmo with the autoplay function, since there is, in fact, a “path” you gotta follow.

Not saying I’m not enjoying the game tho. Cleared 50 hours. Probably won’t clear the 500 hours tho
So it's basically a power level you pay for with silver and time. I think we get access at 52 or so.
    No. You get access at 50 when you hit 302 ilvl and finish vern.
    It will skip an alt to level 50, it works the same as the vern pass no?
        yes and it requires at least 600g. the further you progress the higher the gold cost becomes but you can skip closer to your highest characters content. you have a maximum of 9 of these to use on your account
            Anything higher than vern for knowledge transfer is a waste. First your alt needs to already have 460 gear to skip to rohendel otherwise you cant use it. You pay 1k gold to skip 1 hour of questing. It doesnt give gear unless its the first KT which gives 302.
                did not know that. I honestly thought it was similar to a power pass item that you can choose which storyline you want to progress to
                    Yeah its weird. I have no idea why anyone would skip an hour of questing for 1k gold. You also have to wait way more than 1 hour to level it up anyway.
                        Right now its useless but down the line when the new classes get released and Gold is becoming slowly worthless cuz theres so much around its worth more paying 1k to save 1hr of time. Especially if you want to play like 2-3 new characters. Thats why on my alt im hoarding fragments
                        So rohendel one doesn’t even give you ilevel 460 gears?
                            Nope. You need to HAVE 460 to even do the transfer.
                so don't do shushire? if i want to stay at 600g?
                    Nah I think it skips shushire too. You just choose the first knowledge transfer out of a couple options. It doesnt force you on a specific tier so dont worry. You choose.
        You get the set of 302 gear but that is it, no consumables like the power pass. Also it costs 600 gold
    You have to finish Vern and pay 600 gold.
        The gold cost starts at 600, but you can knowledge transfer to higher tiers for more gold once your main hits certain ilvl and story breakpoints.
            Also true, but seldom worth it beyond Vern as the alt must already meet the ilvl requirement for the region you’re skipping.
    I thought I heard it was 600 gold, not silver?
    It costs 600 gold, not silver
I think that's a future feature coming to NA/EU...it's basically alternate power pass. it needs some additional steps/conditions/time but it's unlimited afaik.
It seems you can put npcs and stuff in the stronghold and buy skins for them, kinda neat
    How do you do that? I had a notifications saying thunder would like to visit but no idea how to bring her
        If you go into the place menu in your stronghold you can place NPCs. same menu you used when you had to place an item for the quest. not sure what the exact name is as I am not in-game right now.
You can invite NPC and change clothes.
And my AXE!
    And my glock
        haha saw that meme the other day and LoL'd
    Yes in your head!
If you stick with the game you get a lot more gold in t3 and later content, so your gold right now is very small.

Korea blue crystal to gold is 1: 17 .  We are like 1:2 at moment.....so yes blue crystals are dirt cheal
    Does the price of blue crystal change?
        the gold price changes, the royal crystal price is constant at like 2.85 ratio
I’m right there with you! Just waiting for that time when I’ll be kicking myself for not doing that “thing” that I should’ve been doing the whole time.
    OP mentioned not opening certain chest up until endgame, I’ve had 50 of them and already opened them 😂
thank you.
There are npcs at the ports that teleport you if you don't want to sail.
    Nice. Thank you.
I use the bio frost and the cruise ship to get to the port/island that is closest to my destination. Really cuts down time
Does the gear + stay when it’s transferred from t1 gear to t2 gear? Or does it just reset to a +1?
    When u go to t2 it starts at +0 again. U can transfer ur +15 t1 gear to t2 802 gear for a free +1.
        Wonderful, thank you very much!
[deleted]
    OP isnt telling you how to have fun, it's called a language barrier. He's simply trying to point out when the actual game starts as in where the fun begins for 90% of people. As someone who just hit T2, I can tell you they are 100% correct.

The reason you want to do things efficiently is because you eventually hit a material wall. If you dont want to be delayed indefinitely on your way to the endgame it's best to get to the point where you are honing gear and selling shit to make ends meet to get to the next tier. 

If you dont care about being stuck for a long time (possibly weeks) then go at your own pace, that's valid. Once you get to Rohendal though you'll realize what all this efficiency is for
Yes you miss 1/3, but if you're limited for time, you can powerpass two alts and get double rewards every day by rotating through them. 2/3 the amount as if you did it all every day, but 2x as much as if you only had 1 character.
    Wait, sorry but I didn't get it. The rest bonus gives double rewards only for the 1st try?

So is this how it works?  
1) 1st day \[2runs\] + 2nd day \[2 runs\] = 4 runs

2) 1st day \[skip\] + 2nd day \[ (x2 on 1st) + (x1 on 2nd)\] = 3 runs

3) 1st day \[skip\] + 2nd day \[skip\] + 3rd day \[x2 on 1st + x2 on second\]= 4 runs
        It gives you essentially one "credit" per missed activity, and costs 2 credits for a double reward. So you get 4 credits on a day you don't use a character, then 4 the next day, then on the third day you use all 8 on 4 activities. 

That's my understanding at least.
            I believe you only get 1 credit for missing a day, so 2 missed days = 1.5 days of rewards in a 3 day interval. 50% loss which is fine if you're short on time and have a lot of alts.
And NA just cries about P2W and how much grind you have to do. This is why we don’t get any games.
Does anyone actually play these games for the story?
    Koreans do. And they are prolly better than either of us lol
Why are you here? Go eat more crayons.
I mean, that depends what your fuckup was? What'd you do?
    Opened all my chests with green crystals on my main lol… I’m sitting at 46k and alt has none - so I guess it’s just keep playing my main and slowly grind on alt in daily chaos and guardians, I can’t see them being able to reverse the chest opening..
        Accept it and move on, it's not a deal breaker if you plan on playing a while
            Thanks :)
        The harmony shards?  Unless your main is past 600 ilvl you're prob gonna need those shards
            Thank you!
I’m tier 1 ilvl 590 and I was able to get 19 blue class books through quests. I ended up buying 1 book on the market. 

If you go to maxroll website, you can search the island tab by rewards. Look for islands with the blue class reward books.
    Going to search for it then. Thanks !
Ive seen a lot of people suggest getting an alt to 420 asap so you can clear the first 24 levels of tower on them to get lots of enhancement materials.
well they also seem to think its more fun to not skip cut scenes when I personally find the main story character dialogue to be really cringey lol (at least in english)
Same, the level cap in this game is 26 to me.
Pretty sure skill potions up the amount availble yo all roaster character s
Some people enjoy things you may not enjoy
nah.  You get it after you clear Luterra Castle.  You ought to be mid 30s when that happens, maybe less if you are rushing through and only doing the main quests, maybe as high as 38 if you are being very methodical.
Jk...There?... stuff

>Thanks for taking the time u/luckystart1 its really appreciated, I do have one question I was hoping you could help me out with. I posted this on another thread, but I was wondering if you know how far behind the JP servers are, currently we just got Biackiss and Kungelanium. In March we are gonna get Hell Biackiss and Valtan. 2nd Quarter the Japanese site says we'll get Cook Seiton (クークセイトン) .Does that put us like 6 months behind? I think I read on some LOA site that translated the KR patch notes from July 2021 something about Hell Biackiss.


If Cook Saton is updated on the Japanese server now, I think the difference with the Korean server is the 4th region Commander Raid, the Lowen Continent, and some convenience updates and events.
    Thank you so much for the reply, been trying to figure out where the JP servers stand, kind of difficult to see a comparison between them all, especially considering you can't play outside of ones region, it would be nice to know where we all stand compared to the base game (KR). Thank you again
If a specific research cannot be found, it may be for one of the following reasons:

1. Lack of stronghold level
2. Lack of Item Level
3. Stronghold quest not progressing
4. Unable to acquire adventure book rewards
>I have a question, does the story ever get ANY better?? I'm nearing the end of Tier 1 story and I've paid attention to every cutscene, read all of the dialogue (main and side quests), and the storytelling and worldbuilding is atrocious. It is so, so bad.  
>  
>Like is it just the localization that made it terrible? Was it this bad in South Korea?

&#x200B;
Satisfaction with stories varies from person to person. However, if you are strict about story narratives, the only satisfactory stories in Lost Ark are Lowen Continents, Feiton Continents, and some islands. Criticism of Lost Ark's story quality exists a lot in Korea, including myself.

The guide I wrote is still incomplete. I'm going to write until all players' curiosity is gone. Currently, the Amazon server has not officially released a proper Tier 3 endgame. Lost Ark is a game that can only be completed with Abyss Raid and Legion Commander Raid. So, until then, proceed with the main story quest. Whenever the progress of the main story quest is blocked, you can play the endgame and raise the item level. And when you have time, you can collect runes and skill points. For now, that's all. Of course, you can also do activities to collect gold, silver coins (shillings), and various other materials as bonuses, but these are covered in detail in this guide.
>The more I read about the upcoming grind, the less I want to continue playing tbh. This feels like an 80 hour workweek with no breaks.

&#x200B;

Surprisingly, I had no problem catching up with other players in 30 minutes of play a day.

*\*writing down intensifies\**
        Instructions unclear, dick caught in a maze
    Now this is the kind of endgame I'm interested in
    I read that and immediately thought of my horror themed animal crossing death maze. 

God imma do that again.
        video or it didnt happen :P
    That’s so evil, I love it
Maze was the first thing i tryed to start making but i lack the space to trap some 2 inside it.
How do you get to tier 2 lmao

It's not by not going to rohendel
This gearing guide by maxroll is pretty good https://lost-ark.maxroll.gg/resources/road-to-rohendel
    Even this is kinda nuts.
        To be fair thats the "speedrun to t3" guide they have a post level 50 one which is less intense, at that point in the game those systems become clearer though.

        One step at a time dude. All that guide really is doing is walking you through where to collect quests and complete them with an order to save you time.
        Ooops I linked the speedrun one, this is the less intense guide
https://lost-ark.maxroll.gg/resources/post-50-guide
    >My god I can't read that font for my life.
I hit level 50 today and I am still confused about how to do dailies at least.
There is a lot here that is translated with slightly different names, so unless you know the system already you won't know which system they are talking about :(

Lots of video and other guide on YouTube and maxroll though
Honestly just play the game...I'm a 46 and the more I read this shit the less it makes me want to play the game.  Just wanna put together some combos and get yelled at for not being good enough
    Best tip, is to just play and experience it for yourself. Try to save valuable items and currency until you know what you are doing. Rule of thumb: green stuff can be used however you feel like. Save blue/purple/orange items until you understand their effects.
All you need to know is basically.

Finish main story. (should happen around lvl 40)

Finish "blue colored" quests (it is your new main story) until it gives you a chest that contains a full 301 item-leveled armor set. (will happen some time after you hit lvl 50)
>every guide I see leaves me more confused than I started.



Lmao, nailed it. I actually have trepidation before reading guides now.



"Hmm.. This may hurt me."
Trust me. In terms of complexity and ITEMIZATION POE is on whole other level.
Sorry, what? You need a guide twice as long as this one for an *introduction* into some of the mechanics in PoE. I'm not saying that makes it a better game or anything but the sheer complexity of it is absolutely absurd.
    You might be right, maybe I’m just used to it now after a few leagues and tons of builds. The newness of lost ark just has my brain scrambled with all the intertwining layers of quests and mats and other stuff lol
I played poe since closed beta. It went for diablo style to idek what I'd call the mish mosh it is today. Way to many mechanics and what not it actually drove me to quit after 8years. PoE too much was much simpler and fun before maps were introduced
    I started playing during ritual league but it seems like every league they change a ton of core mechanics, changing skills, tons of nerfs and just killing a lot of good builds. I was getting tired of spending so much time on a build just to have it completely ruined next league.
Koreans are the best gamers - it is known.
    Japanese: oh thank goodness the weirdos moved onto a new Asian country to worship.
        Japan were considered gods of fighting games for a long time, Koreans were the gods of RTS since Starcraft and then League of Legends, which isn't really an RTS but controls similar to one.  It's a shame Dota 2 never really took off in Korea.
            Sports/competiton is all about structure, organization and support and then critical mass. The best gamers come from communities where there's plenty of people who help others achieve those competitive goals, something that Korean starcraft players had an advantage in, and Japanese FGC players had for fighting games. 

Its like olympics, more people and more money and more interest = better players once enough time has passed.

Leveling is kinda boring but when you get to lvl 50 and finish castle vern storyline, you willa have almost all t1 endgame unlocked. That means your gameplay changes from 50/50 walking talking/fighting into 20/80 sailinig/fighting. It took me around 25 hours of total gameplay for the first time to get there ;)
    25 hours to reach level 50, or 25 hours total?
        Probably to reach 50. But that's not even an issue this is an MMO. It would take thousands upon thousands of hours to "beat" this game. By the time you would "beat" it there would be more and more content to do.
            > thousands of hours to "beat" this game.

of course, that's not an issue. My issue was the game so far has been a devil may cry/god of war instead of an mmorpg
                Ah I see. I think that is just typical MMO behavior right? At least in this day and age of MMOs. You level up and quest and basically play story mode or co-op story mode until you get to end game and reveal the rest of the game.
I've felt like I've been on crazy pills. Everyone is hailing this as the best MMO they've ever played (minus the launch and server issues), meanwhile I'm roaming around the most linear questing I've ever done in an MMO, spamming G, listening to bad voice acting and boring cut scenes in an ultra generic story that can't pick even a handful of themes to stick with. I literally just fought an army of clowns and suddenly I'm on a pirate ship and then I'm in "Honey, I Shrunk The Kids". I have thematic whiplash. Meanwhile, I take out my electric guitar to teleport to town, and never put my pistols away while I gesture wildly to NPCs, waving my guns in  their face.

I keep holding out hope that the end-game will reel me in, because both me and my buddy I'm leveling with feel like we're losing our minds. I understand the game isn't going to be for everyone, but I have a lot of MMO experience in general from way back in Ultima Online and EQ, and years in WoW, Rift, GW2, FFXIV, TERA, and more... this has been the dullest experience I've ever had from start to end-game to date.

I walked in with high hopes since I love the idea of an MMO mixed with an ARPG, since those are two of my favorite genres, and we both feel that the combat has been great, but everything else has been so lackluster for us.
    This game is ALL about end game. Theres a reason you get 2 free lvl 50 boosts once you compete MSQ. Theres a reason you can use 600g to power boost up to 9 toons. The Devs are confidant that their endgame is what keeps ppl playing. I agree that the leveling was boring....but you do it once and never have to do it again unless you want to. I hate leveling in every MMO ive ever played tbh. Im an end game person.
        Great, thanks, that's comforting to hear at least. I only knew about the 2 boosts and not the other stuff, so that's even better. Appreciate the info!
    >I literally just fought an army of clowns and suddenly I'm on a pirate ship and then I'm in "Honey, I Shrunk The Kids". I have thematic whiplash.

This sounds like quite a phenomenal time. Sorry you don't enjoy the game!
        Yeah its a blast to me and this description is hilarious lol.
        Kokomos, when will they learn?
    >years in WoW, Rift, GW2, FFXIV, TERA, and more…

I feel like I’m the one who’s on crazy pills when I read comments like this one.

I didn’t play Rift, but I played all those others, and I find the leveling in Lost Ark to be EXACTLY the same experience except Lost Ark’s combat is fun.

Of those you listed, Tera is the only one that’s fun to play on a gameplay level before endgame. All the others are not only the exact same endless chain of fetch quests as Lost Ark, but tied to a zero-gameplay combat system.

WoW - pick enemy, quote numbers at each other, the one who quoted the higher numbers wins. Leveling in Shadowlands was far more miserable than leveling in Lost Ark, especially if you want to talk about bad story.

FFXIV - I feel like when people talk about leveling in FFXIV they forget that ARR is just a series of fetch quests broken up by exposition. It’s all setup for the story to start in Heavensward.

Point is, I find my leveling experience in Lost Ark to be an exact 1 to 1 match for my leveling experience in every single other MMO.

Except the combat is fun.

And then you get to endgame content, which is fun to do, just like in every other MMO.

I really don’t understand how other long-term MMO fans have any kind of problem with Lost Ark. I feel like we would have collectively built up a tolerance for this sort of thing by now.
        Yeah Lost Ark is one of the few games where I get off my mount to fight random shit because combat is just so fun.
            Seeing so many people talk about how fun the combat is, even while leveling,  makes me wonder if I chose the wrong class.  I'm playing as a berserker and still leveling, and so far 90% of combat is walking up to a pack of mobs and pressing 1 or 2 buttons to delete everything, which is cool the first few times but not super engaging, imo. Hoping to have the time to grind through the rest of the leveling this weekend so I can unlock some of the endgame content and hopefully understand the hype.
                Oh man you should go make new characters and use the class tester to try out a bunch of specs. I think warrior and mage are the most boring classes.

Gunslinger, deathblade, scrapper, sharpshooter, all are really fun with interesting combos - esp deathblade.
                    Good call, I'll try out a few more while I grind my way towards the power pass. Gunslinger and Deathblade definitely look interesting, and I'm most excited for when lancemaster comes eventually.
                        Ooh I didn't know more were coming. Yeah I want to get the power pass too so I can have the other classes on this server. But apparently u have to complete the main story after 50 which may take a while.
                Honestly mayhem berserker is mostly just like 2 buttons. Once you unlock the power pass I’d look into some of the more complex gameplay classes
                    Good to know I'm not the only one who feels that way, wish I'd put more thought into my class selection beyond just going for the big sword. Looking forward to getting the power pass to try other classes.
        Thank god, I thought I was going crazy. How are there all these comments about leveling with the “I’ve play xyz MMO” comments but then basically show you’ve never played those games at all? Or maybe they’ve got a giant hate boner for this game? Idk this is such a standard mmo with a semi boring grind to max level where the real game starts.
        Exactly this. If you dont like boring leveling process maybe dont play theme park mmos? This is sort of what the leveling process is. A running and dialogue simulator with some skill usage on enemies that are designed for anyone to be able to kill. 

Lost ark just actually makes the last part fun. Lost ark also has a ton of content for casuals and a ton of progression for die hards. This is a really really really good mmo and it is possible that maybe the genre just isnt for you anymore.
        I disagree, I found guild wars 2 was pretty unique and pretty fun to level in. It has a pretty unique system that does a good job embracing multiplayer. I also really enjoy lost ark though so I agree with most everything else you said.
            The thing that made leveling in GW2 was the number of "Oh what's that?!" things around  - jump puzzles, vistas, collectibles, area events, etc. to just jump in on to get rid of the monotony of "My child is dying, please go kill 14 Skilabundoos for their venom sacs to make this potion".

Lost Arks has a bit of those with there being a bunch of collectibles/vistas/looking out for the world bosses but GW2 had a TON of them.
                I agree. I’m not crazy about the story in GW2, but the exploration is fantastic.
        I guess I valued the quality of the cut scenes/dialogue/story to reel me in rather than only the combat. Rift was my favorite of the ones I listed because the zones were more interactive and changing, with invasions and rifts popping up that you'd have to deal with. GW2 was also fun to level since you could literally do whatever you wanted and level up, with an emphasis on exploring and PVP and such. ESO was another favorite (I forgot to list specifically), since the zones are so beautiful, and most of the quests are actual lines with a story and characters with real voice acting, and choices that matter. TERA was also lovely in terms of how beautiful it was and how engaging the combat was. I didn't hate WoW, it was very fetch-y and required so much time running around from zone to zone, but still the quality of the game and the cut scenes and the story (up until a certain point) was enough to keep me going.

Combat alone \*is\* enough to keep me going, but the questing in Lost Ark is much less combat than it is carrying barrels, talking to someone 3 feet away from someone else and then going back and talking to them, and running from point A to point B. Even when there is combat, generally speaking it's "kill these 3 mobs, even though there's 20 there" and then you walk up and 1-shot them and walk back and talk for another 2 minutes.
            >	I guess I valued the quality of the cut scenes/dialogue/story to reel me in rather than only the combat.

Yeah, that makes sense to me.

I can put up with lackluster combat if the story is good, or vice-versa. But I can see how if you want the story to make you invested in the gameplay, Lost Ark would be a hard sell.

The story gets a little better after North Vern, mainly because (for the most part) NPCs stop showing up after the boss fight and “saving” you from a fight you just won. Also, there are some cool characters and set pieces in Rohendel and Yorn.

But I find it’s Guardian Raids and Abyssal Dungeons that are keeping me engaged.
                Yeah, it's hearing about those dungeons/raids and seeing some of the video of combat and mechanics from those that are mainly the push for me to keep going. I'm optimistic I'll enjoy that part of the game a lot more. Thanks for taking the time to share the info and your experience! Hopefully I'll be starting that content within a few days here. Hearing all of you reply is motivating to keep pushing through.
            > I didn't hate WoW, it was very fetch-y and required so much time running around from zone to zone, but still the quality of the game and the cut scenes and the story (up until a certain point) was enough to keep me going.

This wow experience is extremely foreign to me and makes absolutely no sense to me. WoW has basically zero cutscenes till somewhere around Legion. Mists and a couple others have a few here or there, but vanilla wow has like the intro cinematic and basically nothing else.

Maybe you came to wow after leveling got totally gimped, but vanillas leveling game play was basically 10 days /played with basically no cutscenes, and reading thousands of walls of text from quest givers for your story. No cutscenes, no story explanation, barely any dialogue, just lots of fetching and reading.

GW I kinda understand your perspective one but GW has always had a great leveling/world experience. FFXIV is kind of all over the place as well, but does have a few cutscenes tying it back together, but I generally found that way more dry and even less compelling than Lost Ark. The rest of your list I don't really understand as LA just feels better... Didn't play rift though.

But compare it to any of the previous gen mmos like WOW at least through WOTLK or EVE, or even further into classics like OSRS, UO, EQ, etc and this is just no comparison IMO. This opinion screams to me of more modern theme park mmo experience instead of anything else.
                Came here to say that what you just wrote about wow. As someone who turned to wow vanilla servers as soon as Nostalrius launched and never looked back at retail, i was so confused with his take on wow
                    Yeah this is a huge "problem" with discussions about WoW IMO. WoW in 2006 vs 2009 vs 2012 vs 2018 are all entirely different games. Claiming you've "played a lot of wow" is kind of meaningless because we could be talking about like 8 different iterations of the game.

Cinematics and a "story" are parts of modern WoW that did exist for the first third of its lifetime. Comparing WoW in the past few years to LA is very different than comparing vanilla to LA.
                        You're right, I didn't play vanilla. I should have been more specific.
    Can confirm, questing is boring as fuck. Spamming g all day also kinda hurts my hand after a while. Wish they'd just let you hold g instead

But after that the game is super fun. Everything from guardian raids, abyss dungeons, to even solo tower challenges. You can get into sailing stuff, do world bosses, and all kinds of other things. End game is packed with a variety of great content that made the main quest worth doing
        You can mouse click instead of g spamming for quests, only need g to accept rewards or accept the quest.
            I've been doing that, too. I've been trying not to spam my way through all the dialogue and cut scenes since I've been holding out some hope with them, but I mean more like "move this barrel" -> G -> climb this rope! -> G -> ride this zipline! -> G -> talk to this person! -> G -> pull this lever! -> G -> Nod at this person! -> G... oh, /nod  


I guess I click some of them, too, but still.
        Thanks, I'll keep chugging along then and continue holding out hope!
            I'm sure people told you already, but just in case, rushing through the main story quests definitely gets you there fastest. You can ignore everything else if you want
                I've heard both, I had some other friends telling me not to skip it or I'd have to go back, but then I keep reading that I can ignore all side quest stuff entirely. We're level 43 now, so it won't be that much longer I guess, we're just having trouble staying motivated, and put off playing the last few days as a result. Hoping to hit 50 and start the end-game stuff this weekend, at least. Thanks for the info. :)
                    The side quests are completely optional. You don't ever need to go back and do them unless you just want to lol. There may be a select few you'll want the rewards from later, but the majority aren't necessary. Either way, good luck
                        That's good to know, I may skip the rest and just push the main quest to finish the story. I appreciate all the info, thanks for taking the time!
            Also of note, you don't really ever need to do the main quest line again.  You get 2 power passes which let you take alts to 50 instantly and then you can spend gold to exchange knowledge in your stronghold to skip the quest for more alts.  So it isn't like you have to slog through that story over and over.
                I did hear about that! I'm thankful for that, since I've been intrigued by the Bard and also want to play a melee character at some point, but the idea of getting from 1-50 again manually is especially daunting at the moment. Appreciate the info!
    it sounds like you're around tortoyk so far? my friends and i were also pretty bored leveling, although we haven't played mmos and have little to compare to. it's picked up since we finished Vern - chaos dungeons are fun, and have the path of exile mapping feel, and guardian raids were the first thing that felt challenging and interactive, with lots of attack patterns to dodge or counterattack (and good lord when i got hulked the first time by a boss...i feel bad for loki now)

but then i went into an abyssal dungeon with a few friends and wiped several times in a row, and oddly, that's what got me hooked. we figured out the attack patterns, how to deal with the wipe mechanics, and it felt like an accomplishment, and what i look forward to most going forwards. 

unfortunately, unless i missed something, it seems like we can only clear once a week, i.e. if we have other friends or guildmates struggling with the dungeon, we can't help sherpa them.
        What you described is exactly what I went into the game hoping for. An ARPG-feel with MMO bossing mehcanics and dungeon/raiding parties. I love a good grind, I just found the game difficult to get into thus far and keep hoping for some more meat to sink my teeth into.
    If you feel like the combat is good, and it’s enough for you to stick to a game, the game does indeed get much better at 50 in my opinion

If you can stick it out until 420 gear score and try the 4th guardian raid, that’s when the game really clicked for me. Prior to that, the enemies were super easy and I could see it getting boring after a few weeks. 

What sucks is that it’s behind level 50, and doing a chain of side quests for roughly 2 hours hopping between islands. 

Another thing would be the abyss dungeons at 340 but I went into it and got placed with some 500 gear score people so I didn’t even see any of the major mechanics of the fights. They killed the bosses way too quickly, and it wasn’t fun. The second time I ran it, my group wasn’t nearly as geared and it would have been another time that the game would have clicked, I had a blast and a good sense of accomplishment 

If you don’t love the combat too much, the game probably isn’t for you imo
        The combat has been the saving grace for me so far, I like the class I'm playing and swapping between the bars and cooldowns, and being mobile and whatnot. I'm hoping once the endgame picks up I'll get to focus more on that and less on the tedious stuff. I don't mind a grind, I have thousands of hours in PoE and the Diablo series, I'm used to it, but those games are all combat which makes the leveling feel better.  


I'll stick with it, thanks. :)
    The 'themes' you are referring to are entirely different regions of the game. It's not all castles and knights on every single continent. 


Thankfully, unlike all those other games mentioned, you really only have to level up once, which to me is a massive upgrade (having played the intro for all those games multiple times). Knowledge transfer in your Stronghold can automatically bring up a new character to the same progress as your main. Though most recommend at least getting to Tier 2 first before using it.
        >Knowledge transfer in your Stronghold can automatically bring up a new character to the same progress as your main. Though most recommend at least getting to Tier 2 first before using it.

That's great to know, thank you!
    yeah I'm on the same boat here. Don't know why they locked the game content behind a 20 hour grind. Even in new world I had fun right off the first levels
    IDK. The quests for me have been "Its so bad its good" in a crack fueled hallucinogenic sort of way. But for me the draw is breadth, depth - and perhaps mostly importantly - game feel.


I played all those games too, from Ultima to Aion and etc...  A lot of games I really loved and still love in a nostalgic sense. And all of them are flawed in some way. Ultima in hindsight is a clunky mess in a generic medieval world. Dark Ages of Camelot is an utter slog which for most of the tenure of its better days was a directionless snoozefest that exceled in some ways.


I can't think of an MMO that has ever had a story that really pulled me in with the exception of Warcraft but only because of childhood nostalgia for Orcs vs Humans.


The absurdities of Lost Ark are amusing for me in their own ways. The utter laziness of these NPCs to pay me to move something 5 feet, or to have a dwarf sit in my pocket while I play music for eggs and rocks... Honestly its a relief to not have to give a fuck about it all lmao.


 A lot of these other MMOs took themselves way too seriously when their story was equally unworthy of being read. I spam G and I'm pretty sure I know the majority of whats going on in Lost Ark and its an utterly goofy mess that is The Room levels of awful entertainment.


But yeah. Really its the breadth of the world and the game feel that are doing it for me right now. I laughed at your comment about the clown army which was followed closely by a really heavy holy inquisition and then I was trying to get a boat and hanging out with pirates. Lmao. 10 hours or so later and I havent even heard about Armen again - perhaps for the best. If I had my choice, Mokamoka would be my sidekick forever though.
        Yeah, the feel of the combat and such, and some of the little boss fights we've done is literally the only thread we're holding onto right now, but it's enough to keep us gently pushing through the game hoping to get into that grind at the end with the majority of the game hopefully being combat instead of moving leaves and barrells and fertilizer around lol  


We're certainly viewing it all as absurd in terms of the story/questing, but I think we lost the humor in it along the way, and just want to fight things.
    So much this. Glad I'm not alone.
    You're a fuckin nutjob bro, all that shit you just said sounds amazing.
    My main group played since the 8th and have been doing daily guardian raids and abyss dungeons and it’s been a blast. My other friend decided to join a little late and NO ONE wanted to redo the campaign. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!! 😂

    First MMO I take it?
        [deleted]
            I can't think of an MMO where leveling isn't ultra easy.  Pretty much all of them are auto pilot going from place to place and collecting boxes/feathers/bugs/whatever this NPC needs for their mid-life crisis.
                [deleted]
                    Imagine an arpg style game where if you pulled too many mobs you died. This is not a game many people would want to play as an mmo (could be good roguelike though!).
                        [deleted]
                            What endgame scenario punishes you for pulling multiple trash mobs again?
                    While I agree you certainly can't grab nearly as many mobs in WoW as you do in LA, outside of classic which is a balancing nightmare you could grab entire camps and burn them down EASILY.

The only time you really die leveling in WoW is if you go AFK and aggro something.
    Well that's what the power pass for finishing Vern is for along with the knowledge transfer at your stronghold. I have 2 alts that I'm gonna boost
        [deleted]
            Well yeah once. Luckily you're not forced to play the game.  I assume.
game gets much better, there are dungeons in which many mobs spawns and you need to mass kill, pretty satisfying imo and there are a lot of bosses/raids, bosses are 100% skill and after you advance 1-2 wiping mechanics appear. You still have plenty of G clicking tho, you need to complete your main quest (ignore all secondary quests) and after that look for the isles guide, pretty boring but it's the fastest path to upgrade.
There was a point around level 35 to 40 that fell flat for me, but once you reach the final area of Luterra, you see the horizon, get your ship, and the game blows open from there.
The dungeons are fun. The visuals were pretty great. I hate the quests too, but I really enjoy my time with the scenery, dungeons and field bosses.
i was alredy happy with PVP and got to 50 and did some end game just to try it out and i cant put it down and haven played pvp in like 3 days, the end game is sooo much, especially abysals
So don't read it? What a stupid take.
Then ignore their tips? This game is incredibly overwhelming to begin with, having tips and guides to help newer players along is only helpful. It’s up to you to ignore it if you want to play through an MMO blind. 

It’s funny you speak like there’s only one way to play MMOs, let others play the way they want.
    I honestly don't understand why people find this game overwhelming.... Maybe it's because people are blazing through it to get to level 50 and not actually playing the game to learn what is happening as you progress....

Ya i think its too early for me to involving myself with all those.. stuff
This game was designed for the endgame to be the "main game" from the director himself - so, the game starting at 50 isn't complete bullshit. Yes, your leveling experience is very useful (especially if you know to pick up collectibles/skill points/engravings/etc) but it isn't the "game", if that makes sense.

You're projecting a lot with that "joylessly sprint" comment. Maybe that isn't how you want to play, and that's okay. Doesn't mean people it's joyless for others. 

You seem to have a rough time with the idea that people can enjoy playing the game a different way than you. I promise, you can play the game you want and they can play the game they want, and you'll both have fun.
The point of skipping side quests , is that you get to the actual end game sooner. All those side quests are not going any where and you can do them anytime, and many of the endgame quests will be leading you back into the same areas. So while you are still under lvl 50, there are people who are 50 already, and have unlocked their dailes, and they get to knock out all their dailes and weeklies, then with the free time, they can clear the rest of the "side content". By taking it slow and doing every side quests, it will slow you down and you will be wasting daily/weekly free resources that are not available to you pre-50.

Can you pm me too please? <3
I’m tryin mg to do this too! Don’t want to get sucked in to all these endless guides. Question: how do you upgrade your lab? And other stuff in the stronghold
    I think if you hit management you just choose from that menu. You need the materials from logging, mining, and foraging. I haven't gotten too deep into it but just have been starting upgrades as I have the mats for them. They all take real life time to complete so I just start them before I log off for the night.
    You gotta get to level 15 stronghold to get level 3 Lab I think if that's what you're after
        Ah ok thanks
            You can check by selecting the drop-downs at the top of the "lab" "workshop" etc sections.

Switch it from "available" to "all" to see all the future things you can upgrade and it'll tell you what you need to unlock it.
    farm xp by 1.) getting ore and lumber, 2.) get a blueprint for something that costs silver, ore & lumber in the workshop to build and gives decent stronghold xp, 3.) spam build it.  And while you are doing that, send out crews on dispatch missions whenever possible.
Yea this has more-or-less been my approach thus far, too. I just always find myself getting caught up in worrying that I will waste valuable resources or do something irredeemably regretful. Trying to get past that hurdle but I'm otherwise having fun just being bad and learning to be less bad through playing.
How much money do you need to spend if you don’t want to play free?
    Even if you don't spend money, there is no problem playing the game. Most in-game functions can be solved with weekly reward gold. If you feel it's cheaper to use cash than to consume gold, you can use cash.
    I actually don't know and really don't want to know. I would say it would be quite costly since theres some form of RNG mechanics to even spending. Minus gear progression/buffs/workshop strongholds. The whole card collecting thing is whole nother level of spending.
No. You get access at 50 when you hit 302 ilvl and finish vern.
It will skip an alt to level 50, it works the same as the vern pass no?
    yes and it requires at least 600g. the further you progress the higher the gold cost becomes but you can skip closer to your highest characters content. you have a maximum of 9 of these to use on your account
        Anything higher than vern for knowledge transfer is a waste. First your alt needs to already have 460 gear to skip to rohendel otherwise you cant use it. You pay 1k gold to skip 1 hour of questing. It doesnt give gear unless its the first KT which gives 302.
            did not know that. I honestly thought it was similar to a power pass item that you can choose which storyline you want to progress to
                Yeah its weird. I have no idea why anyone would skip an hour of questing for 1k gold. You also have to wait way more than 1 hour to level it up anyway.
                    Right now its useless but down the line when the new classes get released and Gold is becoming slowly worthless cuz theres so much around its worth more paying 1k to save 1hr of time. Especially if you want to play like 2-3 new characters. Thats why on my alt im hoarding fragments
                    So rohendel one doesn’t even give you ilevel 460 gears?
                        Nope. You need to HAVE 460 to even do the transfer.
            so don't do shushire? if i want to stay at 600g?
                Nah I think it skips shushire too. You just choose the first knowledge transfer out of a couple options. It doesnt force you on a specific tier so dont worry. You choose.
    You get the set of 302 gear but that is it, no consumables like the power pass. Also it costs 600 gold
You have to finish Vern and pay 600 gold.
    The gold cost starts at 600, but you can knowledge transfer to higher tiers for more gold once your main hits certain ilvl and story breakpoints.
        Also true, but seldom worth it beyond Vern as the alt must already meet the ilvl requirement for the region you’re skipping.
I thought I heard it was 600 gold, not silver?
It costs 600 gold, not silver
How do you do that? I had a notifications saying thunder would like to visit but no idea how to bring her
    If you go into the place menu in your stronghold you can place NPCs. same menu you used when you had to place an item for the quest. not sure what the exact name is as I am not in-game right now.
And my glock
    haha saw that meme the other day and LoL'd
Yes in your head!
Does the price of blue crystal change?
    the gold price changes, the royal crystal price is constant at like 2.85 ratio
OP mentioned not opening certain chest up until endgame, I’ve had 50 of them and already opened them 😂
Nice. Thank you.
When u go to t2 it starts at +0 again. U can transfer ur +15 t1 gear to t2 802 gear for a free +1.
    Wonderful, thank you very much!
OP isnt telling you how to have fun, it's called a language barrier. He's simply trying to point out when the actual game starts as in where the fun begins for 90% of people. As someone who just hit T2, I can tell you they are 100% correct.

The reason you want to do things efficiently is because you eventually hit a material wall. If you dont want to be delayed indefinitely on your way to the endgame it's best to get to the point where you are honing gear and selling shit to make ends meet to get to the next tier. 

If you dont care about being stuck for a long time (possibly weeks) then go at your own pace, that's valid. Once you get to Rohendal though you'll realize what all this efficiency is for
Wait, sorry but I didn't get it. The rest bonus gives double rewards only for the 1st try?

So is this how it works?  
1) 1st day \[2runs\] + 2nd day \[2 runs\] = 4 runs

2) 1st day \[skip\] + 2nd day \[ (x2 on 1st) + (x1 on 2nd)\] = 3 runs

3) 1st day \[skip\] + 2nd day \[skip\] + 3rd day \[x2 on 1st + x2 on second\]= 4 runs
    It gives you essentially one "credit" per missed activity, and costs 2 credits for a double reward. So you get 4 credits on a day you don't use a character, then 4 the next day, then on the third day you use all 8 on 4 activities. 

That's my understanding at least.
        I believe you only get 1 credit for missing a day, so 2 missed days = 1.5 days of rewards in a 3 day interval. 50% loss which is fine if you're short on time and have a lot of alts.
Koreans do. And they are prolly better than either of us lol
Opened all my chests with green crystals on my main lol… I’m sitting at 46k and alt has none - so I guess it’s just keep playing my main and slowly grind on alt in daily chaos and guardians, I can’t see them being able to reverse the chest opening..
    Accept it and move on, it's not a deal breaker if you plan on playing a while
        Thanks :)
    The harmony shards?  Unless your main is past 600 ilvl you're prob gonna need those shards
        Thank you!
Going to search for it then. Thanks !
Thank you so much for the reply, been trying to figure out where the JP servers stand, kind of difficult to see a comparison between them all, especially considering you can't play outside of ones region, it would be nice to know where we all stand compared to the base game (KR). Thank you again
...and by main quest are we talking about past Rohendel?
Ay thats good ty

God imma do that again.
    video or it didnt happen :P
That’s so evil, I love it
Even this is kinda nuts.
    To be fair thats the "speedrun to t3" guide they have a post level 50 one which is less intense, at that point in the game those systems become clearer though.

    One step at a time dude. All that guide really is doing is walking you through where to collect quests and complete them with an order to save you time.
    Ooops I linked the speedrun one, this is the less intense guide

>My god I can't read that font for my life.
Best tip, is to just play and experience it for yourself. Try to save valuable items and currency until you know what you are doing. Rule of thumb: green stuff can be used however you feel like. Save blue/purple/orange items until you understand their effects.
You might be right, maybe I’m just used to it now after a few leagues and tons of builds. The newness of lost ark just has my brain scrambled with all the intertwining layers of quests and mats and other stuff lol
I started playing during ritual league but it seems like every league they change a ton of core mechanics, changing skills, tons of nerfs and just killing a lot of good builds. I was getting tired of spending so much time on a build just to have it completely ruined next league.
Japanese: oh thank goodness the weirdos moved onto a new Asian country to worship.
    Japan were considered gods of fighting games for a long time, Koreans were the gods of RTS since Starcraft and then League of Legends, which isn't really an RTS but controls similar to one.  It's a shame Dota 2 never really took off in Korea.
        Sports/competiton is all about structure, organization and support and then critical mass. The best gamers come from communities where there's plenty of people who help others achieve those competitive goals, something that Korean starcraft players had an advantage in, and Japanese FGC players had for fighting games. 

Its like olympics, more people and more money and more interest = better players once enough time has passed.
        MVP phoenix RIP
    Have you been living under a rock?
        I'm making a joke about the increase in koreaboos. It's not that deep.
    *Koreaboos
25 hours to reach level 50, or 25 hours total?
    Probably to reach 50. But that's not even an issue this is an MMO. It would take thousands upon thousands of hours to "beat" this game. By the time you would "beat" it there would be more and more content to do.
        > thousands of hours to "beat" this game.

of course, that's not an issue. My issue was the game so far has been a devil may cry/god of war instead of an mmorpg
            Ah I see. I think that is just typical MMO behavior right? At least in this day and age of MMOs. You level up and quest and basically play story mode or co-op story mode until you get to end game and reveal the rest of the game.
This game is ALL about end game. Theres a reason you get 2 free lvl 50 boosts once you compete MSQ. Theres a reason you can use 600g to power boost up to 9 toons. The Devs are confidant that their endgame is what keeps ppl playing. I agree that the leveling was boring....but you do it once and never have to do it again unless you want to. I hate leveling in every MMO ive ever played tbh. Im an end game person.
    Great, thanks, that's comforting to hear at least. I only knew about the 2 boosts and not the other stuff, so that's even better. Appreciate the info!
>I literally just fought an army of clowns and suddenly I'm on a pirate ship and then I'm in "Honey, I Shrunk The Kids". I have thematic whiplash.

This sounds like quite a phenomenal time. Sorry you don't enjoy the game!
    Yeah its a blast to me and this description is hilarious lol.
    Kokomos, when will they learn?
>years in WoW, Rift, GW2, FFXIV, TERA, and more…

I feel like I’m the one who’s on crazy pills when I read comments like this one.

I didn’t play Rift, but I played all those others, and I find the leveling in Lost Ark to be EXACTLY the same experience except Lost Ark’s combat is fun.

Of those you listed, Tera is the only one that’s fun to play on a gameplay level before endgame. All the others are not only the exact same endless chain of fetch quests as Lost Ark, but tied to a zero-gameplay combat system.

WoW - pick enemy, quote numbers at each other, the one who quoted the higher numbers wins. Leveling in Shadowlands was far more miserable than leveling in Lost Ark, especially if you want to talk about bad story.

FFXIV - I feel like when people talk about leveling in FFXIV they forget that ARR is just a series of fetch quests broken up by exposition. It’s all setup for the story to start in Heavensward.

Point is, I find my leveling experience in Lost Ark to be an exact 1 to 1 match for my leveling experience in every single other MMO.

Except the combat is fun.

And then you get to endgame content, which is fun to do, just like in every other MMO.

I really don’t understand how other long-term MMO fans have any kind of problem with Lost Ark. I feel like we would have collectively built up a tolerance for this sort of thing by now.
    Yeah Lost Ark is one of the few games where I get off my mount to fight random shit because combat is just so fun.
        Seeing so many people talk about how fun the combat is, even while leveling,  makes me wonder if I chose the wrong class.  I'm playing as a berserker and still leveling, and so far 90% of combat is walking up to a pack of mobs and pressing 1 or 2 buttons to delete everything, which is cool the first few times but not super engaging, imo. Hoping to have the time to grind through the rest of the leveling this weekend so I can unlock some of the endgame content and hopefully understand the hype.
            Oh man you should go make new characters and use the class tester to try out a bunch of specs. I think warrior and mage are the most boring classes.

Gunslinger, deathblade, scrapper, sharpshooter, all are really fun with interesting combos - esp deathblade.
                Good call, I'll try out a few more while I grind my way towards the power pass. Gunslinger and Deathblade definitely look interesting, and I'm most excited for when lancemaster comes eventually.
                    Ooh I didn't know more were coming. Yeah I want to get the power pass too so I can have the other classes on this server. But apparently u have to complete the main story after 50 which may take a while.
            Honestly mayhem berserker is mostly just like 2 buttons. Once you unlock the power pass I’d look into some of the more complex gameplay classes
                Good to know I'm not the only one who feels that way, wish I'd put more thought into my class selection beyond just going for the big sword. Looking forward to getting the power pass to try other classes.
    Thank god, I thought I was going crazy. How are there all these comments about leveling with the “I’ve play xyz MMO” comments but then basically show you’ve never played those games at all? Or maybe they’ve got a giant hate boner for this game? Idk this is such a standard mmo with a semi boring grind to max level where the real game starts.
    Exactly this. If you dont like boring leveling process maybe dont play theme park mmos? This is sort of what the leveling process is. A running and dialogue simulator with some skill usage on enemies that are designed for anyone to be able to kill. 

Lost ark just actually makes the last part fun. Lost ark also has a ton of content for casuals and a ton of progression for die hards. This is a really really really good mmo and it is possible that maybe the genre just isnt for you anymore.
    I disagree, I found guild wars 2 was pretty unique and pretty fun to level in. It has a pretty unique system that does a good job embracing multiplayer. I also really enjoy lost ark though so I agree with most everything else you said.
        The thing that made leveling in GW2 was the number of "Oh what's that?!" things around  - jump puzzles, vistas, collectibles, area events, etc. to just jump in on to get rid of the monotony of "My child is dying, please go kill 14 Skilabundoos for their venom sacs to make this potion".

Lost Arks has a bit of those with there being a bunch of collectibles/vistas/looking out for the world bosses but GW2 had a TON of them.
            I agree. I’m not crazy about the story in GW2, but the exploration is fantastic.
    I guess I valued the quality of the cut scenes/dialogue/story to reel me in rather than only the combat. Rift was my favorite of the ones I listed because the zones were more interactive and changing, with invasions and rifts popping up that you'd have to deal with. GW2 was also fun to level since you could literally do whatever you wanted and level up, with an emphasis on exploring and PVP and such. ESO was another favorite (I forgot to list specifically), since the zones are so beautiful, and most of the quests are actual lines with a story and characters with real voice acting, and choices that matter. TERA was also lovely in terms of how beautiful it was and how engaging the combat was. I didn't hate WoW, it was very fetch-y and required so much time running around from zone to zone, but still the quality of the game and the cut scenes and the story (up until a certain point) was enough to keep me going.

Combat alone \*is\* enough to keep me going, but the questing in Lost Ark is much less combat than it is carrying barrels, talking to someone 3 feet away from someone else and then going back and talking to them, and running from point A to point B. Even when there is combat, generally speaking it's "kill these 3 mobs, even though there's 20 there" and then you walk up and 1-shot them and walk back and talk for another 2 minutes.
        >	I guess I valued the quality of the cut scenes/dialogue/story to reel me in rather than only the combat.

Yeah, that makes sense to me.

I can put up with lackluster combat if the story is good, or vice-versa. But I can see how if you want the story to make you invested in the gameplay, Lost Ark would be a hard sell.

The story gets a little better after North Vern, mainly because (for the most part) NPCs stop showing up after the boss fight and “saving” you from a fight you just won. Also, there are some cool characters and set pieces in Rohendel and Yorn.

But I find it’s Guardian Raids and Abyssal Dungeons that are keeping me engaged.
            Yeah, it's hearing about those dungeons/raids and seeing some of the video of combat and mechanics from those that are mainly the push for me to keep going. I'm optimistic I'll enjoy that part of the game a lot more. Thanks for taking the time to share the info and your experience! Hopefully I'll be starting that content within a few days here. Hearing all of you reply is motivating to keep pushing through.
        > I didn't hate WoW, it was very fetch-y and required so much time running around from zone to zone, but still the quality of the game and the cut scenes and the story (up until a certain point) was enough to keep me going.

This wow experience is extremely foreign to me and makes absolutely no sense to me. WoW has basically zero cutscenes till somewhere around Legion. Mists and a couple others have a few here or there, but vanilla wow has like the intro cinematic and basically nothing else.

Maybe you came to wow after leveling got totally gimped, but vanillas leveling game play was basically 10 days /played with basically no cutscenes, and reading thousands of walls of text from quest givers for your story. No cutscenes, no story explanation, barely any dialogue, just lots of fetching and reading.

GW I kinda understand your perspective one but GW has always had a great leveling/world experience. FFXIV is kind of all over the place as well, but does have a few cutscenes tying it back together, but I generally found that way more dry and even less compelling than Lost Ark. The rest of your list I don't really understand as LA just feels better... Didn't play rift though.

But compare it to any of the previous gen mmos like WOW at least through WOTLK or EVE, or even further into classics like OSRS, UO, EQ, etc and this is just no comparison IMO. This opinion screams to me of more modern theme park mmo experience instead of anything else.
            Came here to say that what you just wrote about wow. As someone who turned to wow vanilla servers as soon as Nostalrius launched and never looked back at retail, i was so confused with his take on wow
                Yeah this is a huge "problem" with discussions about WoW IMO. WoW in 2006 vs 2009 vs 2012 vs 2018 are all entirely different games. Claiming you've "played a lot of wow" is kind of meaningless because we could be talking about like 8 different iterations of the game.

Cinematics and a "story" are parts of modern WoW that did exist for the first third of its lifetime. Comparing WoW in the past few years to LA is very different than comparing vanilla to LA.
                    You're right, I didn't play vanilla. I should have been more specific.
Can confirm, questing is boring as fuck. Spamming g all day also kinda hurts my hand after a while. Wish they'd just let you hold g instead

But after that the game is super fun. Everything from guardian raids, abyss dungeons, to even solo tower challenges. You can get into sailing stuff, do world bosses, and all kinds of other things. End game is packed with a variety of great content that made the main quest worth doing
    You can mouse click instead of g spamming for quests, only need g to accept rewards or accept the quest.
        I've been doing that, too. I've been trying not to spam my way through all the dialogue and cut scenes since I've been holding out some hope with them, but I mean more like "move this barrel" -> G -> climb this rope! -> G -> ride this zipline! -> G -> talk to this person! -> G -> pull this lever! -> G -> Nod at this person! -> G... oh, /nod  


I guess I click some of them, too, but still.
    Thanks, I'll keep chugging along then and continue holding out hope!
        I'm sure people told you already, but just in case, rushing through the main story quests definitely gets you there fastest. You can ignore everything else if you want
            I've heard both, I had some other friends telling me not to skip it or I'd have to go back, but then I keep reading that I can ignore all side quest stuff entirely. We're level 43 now, so it won't be that much longer I guess, we're just having trouble staying motivated, and put off playing the last few days as a result. Hoping to hit 50 and start the end-game stuff this weekend, at least. Thanks for the info. :)
                The side quests are completely optional. You don't ever need to go back and do them unless you just want to lol. There may be a select few you'll want the rewards from later, but the majority aren't necessary. Either way, good luck
                    That's good to know, I may skip the rest and just push the main quest to finish the story. I appreciate all the info, thanks for taking the time!
        Also of note, you don't really ever need to do the main quest line again.  You get 2 power passes which let you take alts to 50 instantly and then you can spend gold to exchange knowledge in your stronghold to skip the quest for more alts.  So it isn't like you have to slog through that story over and over.
            I did hear about that! I'm thankful for that, since I've been intrigued by the Bard and also want to play a melee character at some point, but the idea of getting from 1-50 again manually is especially daunting at the moment. Appreciate the info!
it sounds like you're around tortoyk so far? my friends and i were also pretty bored leveling, although we haven't played mmos and have little to compare to. it's picked up since we finished Vern - chaos dungeons are fun, and have the path of exile mapping feel, and guardian raids were the first thing that felt challenging and interactive, with lots of attack patterns to dodge or counterattack (and good lord when i got hulked the first time by a boss...i feel bad for loki now)

but then i went into an abyssal dungeon with a few friends and wiped several times in a row, and oddly, that's what got me hooked. we figured out the attack patterns, how to deal with the wipe mechanics, and it felt like an accomplishment, and what i look forward to most going forwards. 

unfortunately, unless i missed something, it seems like we can only clear once a week, i.e. if we have other friends or guildmates struggling with the dungeon, we can't help sherpa them.
    What you described is exactly what I went into the game hoping for. An ARPG-feel with MMO bossing mehcanics and dungeon/raiding parties. I love a good grind, I just found the game difficult to get into thus far and keep hoping for some more meat to sink my teeth into.
If you feel like the combat is good, and it’s enough for you to stick to a game, the game does indeed get much better at 50 in my opinion

If you can stick it out until 420 gear score and try the 4th guardian raid, that’s when the game really clicked for me. Prior to that, the enemies were super easy and I could see it getting boring after a few weeks. 

What sucks is that it’s behind level 50, and doing a chain of side quests for roughly 2 hours hopping between islands. 

Another thing would be the abyss dungeons at 340 but I went into it and got placed with some 500 gear score people so I didn’t even see any of the major mechanics of the fights. They killed the bosses way too quickly, and it wasn’t fun. The second time I ran it, my group wasn’t nearly as geared and it would have been another time that the game would have clicked, I had a blast and a good sense of accomplishment 

If you don’t love the combat too much, the game probably isn’t for you imo
    The combat has been the saving grace for me so far, I like the class I'm playing and swapping between the bars and cooldowns, and being mobile and whatnot. I'm hoping once the endgame picks up I'll get to focus more on that and less on the tedious stuff. I don't mind a grind, I have thousands of hours in PoE and the Diablo series, I'm used to it, but those games are all combat which makes the leveling feel better.  


I'll stick with it, thanks. :)
The 'themes' you are referring to are entirely different regions of the game. It's not all castles and knights on every single continent. 


Thankfully, unlike all those other games mentioned, you really only have to level up once, which to me is a massive upgrade (having played the intro for all those games multiple times). Knowledge transfer in your Stronghold can automatically bring up a new character to the same progress as your main. Though most recommend at least getting to Tier 2 first before using it.
    >Knowledge transfer in your Stronghold can automatically bring up a new character to the same progress as your main. Though most recommend at least getting to Tier 2 first before using it.

That's great to know, thank you!
yeah I'm on the same boat here. Don't know why they locked the game content behind a 20 hour grind. Even in new world I had fun right off the first levels
IDK. The quests for me have been "Its so bad its good" in a crack fueled hallucinogenic sort of way. But for me the draw is breadth, depth - and perhaps mostly importantly - game feel.


I played all those games too, from Ultima to Aion and etc...  A lot of games I really loved and still love in a nostalgic sense. And all of them are flawed in some way. Ultima in hindsight is a clunky mess in a generic medieval world. Dark Ages of Camelot is an utter slog which for most of the tenure of its better days was a directionless snoozefest that exceled in some ways.


I can't think of an MMO that has ever had a story that really pulled me in with the exception of Warcraft but only because of childhood nostalgia for Orcs vs Humans.


The absurdities of Lost Ark are amusing for me in their own ways. The utter laziness of these NPCs to pay me to move something 5 feet, or to have a dwarf sit in my pocket while I play music for eggs and rocks... Honestly its a relief to not have to give a fuck about it all lmao.


 A lot of these other MMOs took themselves way too seriously when their story was equally unworthy of being read. I spam G and I'm pretty sure I know the majority of whats going on in Lost Ark and its an utterly goofy mess that is The Room levels of awful entertainment.


But yeah. Really its the breadth of the world and the game feel that are doing it for me right now. I laughed at your comment about the clown army which was followed closely by a really heavy holy inquisition and then I was trying to get a boat and hanging out with pirates. Lmao. 10 hours or so later and I havent even heard about Armen again - perhaps for the best. If I had my choice, Mokamoka would be my sidekick forever though.
    Yeah, the feel of the combat and such, and some of the little boss fights we've done is literally the only thread we're holding onto right now, but it's enough to keep us gently pushing through the game hoping to get into that grind at the end with the majority of the game hopefully being combat instead of moving leaves and barrells and fertilizer around lol  


We're certainly viewing it all as absurd in terms of the story/questing, but I think we lost the humor in it along the way, and just want to fight things.
So much this. Glad I'm not alone.
You're a fuckin nutjob bro, all that shit you just said sounds amazing.
My main group played since the 8th and have been doing daily guardian raids and abyss dungeons and it’s been a blast. My other friend decided to join a little late and NO ONE wanted to redo the campaign. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!! 😂
[deleted]
First MMO I take it?
    [deleted]
        I can't think of an MMO where leveling isn't ultra easy.  Pretty much all of them are auto pilot going from place to place and collecting boxes/feathers/bugs/whatever this NPC needs for their mid-life crisis.
            [deleted]
                Imagine an arpg style game where if you pulled too many mobs you died. This is not a game many people would want to play as an mmo (could be good roguelike though!).
                    [deleted]
                        What endgame scenario punishes you for pulling multiple trash mobs again?
                While I agree you certainly can't grab nearly as many mobs in WoW as you do in LA, outside of classic which is a balancing nightmare you could grab entire camps and burn them down EASILY.

The only time you really die leveling in WoW is if you go AFK and aggro something.
Well that's what the power pass for finishing Vern is for along with the knowledge transfer at your stronghold. I have 2 alts that I'm gonna boost
    [deleted]
        Well yeah once. Luckily you're not forced to play the game.  I assume.
I honestly don't understand why people find this game overwhelming.... Maybe it's because people are blazing through it to get to level 50 and not actually playing the game to learn what is happening as you progress....

Edit: Another guide. I use this to complete the adventure books https://www.htfgamestudio100.com/
            Dang nice Ty how do I follow this god like post
                Your choice haha, I personally use the daily checklist since Im level 50.3 and the experienced player tips. Also, dont forget to use all of your daily rapport emotes and sheet music
                Here is a guide to complete every continent 100% I use https://www.htfgamestudio100.com/
I think if you hit management you just choose from that menu. You need the materials from logging, mining, and foraging. I haven't gotten too deep into it but just have been starting upgrades as I have the mats for them. They all take real life time to complete so I just start them before I log off for the night.
You gotta get to level 15 stronghold to get level 3 Lab I think if that's what you're after
    Ah ok thanks
        You can check by selecting the drop-downs at the top of the "lab" "workshop" etc sections.

Switch it from "available" to "all" to see all the future things you can upgrade and it'll tell you what you need to unlock it.
farm xp by 1.) getting ore and lumber, 2.) get a blueprint for something that costs silver, ore & lumber in the workshop to build and gives decent stronghold xp, 3.) spam build it.  And while you are doing that, send out crews on dispatch missions whenever possible.
Even if you don't spend money, there is no problem playing the game. Most in-game functions can be solved with weekly reward gold. If you feel it's cheaper to use cash than to consume gold, you can use cash.
I actually don't know and really don't want to know. I would say it would be quite costly since theres some form of RNG mechanics to even spending. Minus gear progression/buffs/workshop strongholds. The whole card collecting thing is whole nother level of spending.
yes and it requires at least 600g. the further you progress the higher the gold cost becomes but you can skip closer to your highest characters content. you have a maximum of 9 of these to use on your account
    Anything higher than vern for knowledge transfer is a waste. First your alt needs to already have 460 gear to skip to rohendel otherwise you cant use it. You pay 1k gold to skip 1 hour of questing. It doesnt give gear unless its the first KT which gives 302.
        did not know that. I honestly thought it was similar to a power pass item that you can choose which storyline you want to progress to
            Yeah its weird. I have no idea why anyone would skip an hour of questing for 1k gold. You also have to wait way more than 1 hour to level it up anyway.
                Right now its useless but down the line when the new classes get released and Gold is becoming slowly worthless cuz theres so much around its worth more paying 1k to save 1hr of time. Especially if you want to play like 2-3 new characters. Thats why on my alt im hoarding fragments
                So rohendel one doesn’t even give you ilevel 460 gears?
                    Nope. You need to HAVE 460 to even do the transfer.
        so don't do shushire? if i want to stay at 600g?
            Nah I think it skips shushire too. You just choose the first knowledge transfer out of a couple options. It doesnt force you on a specific tier so dont worry. You choose.
You get the set of 302 gear but that is it, no consumables like the power pass. Also it costs 600 gold
The gold cost starts at 600, but you can knowledge transfer to higher tiers for more gold once your main hits certain ilvl and story breakpoints.
    Also true, but seldom worth it beyond Vern as the alt must already meet the ilvl requirement for the region you’re skipping.
If you go into the place menu in your stronghold you can place NPCs. same menu you used when you had to place an item for the quest. not sure what the exact name is as I am not in-game right now.
haha saw that meme the other day and LoL'd
the gold price changes, the royal crystal price is constant at like 2.85 ratio
Wonderful, thank you very much!
It gives you essentially one "credit" per missed activity, and costs 2 credits for a double reward. So you get 4 credits on a day you don't use a character, then 4 the next day, then on the third day you use all 8 on 4 activities. 

That's my understanding at least.
    I believe you only get 1 credit for missing a day, so 2 missed days = 1.5 days of rewards in a 3 day interval. 50% loss which is fine if you're short on time and have a lot of alts.
Accept it and move on, it's not a deal breaker if you plan on playing a while
    Thanks :)
The harmony shards?  Unless your main is past 600 ilvl you're prob gonna need those shards
    Thank you!
Instructions unclear, dick caught in a maze
video or it didnt happen :P
To be fair thats the "speedrun to t3" guide they have a post level 50 one which is less intense, at that point in the game those systems become clearer though.

One step at a time dude. All that guide really is doing is walking you through where to collect quests and complete them with an order to save you time.
Ooops I linked the speedrun one, this is the less intense guide

Japan were considered gods of fighting games for a long time, Koreans were the gods of RTS since Starcraft and then League of Legends, which isn't really an RTS but controls similar to one.  It's a shame Dota 2 never really took off in Korea.
    Sports/competiton is all about structure, organization and support and then critical mass. The best gamers come from communities where there's plenty of people who help others achieve those competitive goals, something that Korean starcraft players had an advantage in, and Japanese FGC players had for fighting games. 

Its like olympics, more people and more money and more interest = better players once enough time has passed.
    MVP phoenix RIP
Have you been living under a rock?
    I'm making a joke about the increase in koreaboos. It's not that deep.
*Koreaboos
Probably to reach 50. But that's not even an issue this is an MMO. It would take thousands upon thousands of hours to "beat" this game. By the time you would "beat" it there would be more and more content to do.
    > thousands of hours to "beat" this game.

of course, that's not an issue. My issue was the game so far has been a devil may cry/god of war instead of an mmorpg
        Ah I see. I think that is just typical MMO behavior right? At least in this day and age of MMOs. You level up and quest and basically play story mode or co-op story mode until you get to end game and reveal the rest of the game.
Great, thanks, that's comforting to hear at least. I only knew about the 2 boosts and not the other stuff, so that's even better. Appreciate the info!
Yeah its a blast to me and this description is hilarious lol.
Kokomos, when will they learn?
Yeah Lost Ark is one of the few games where I get off my mount to fight random shit because combat is just so fun.
    Seeing so many people talk about how fun the combat is, even while leveling,  makes me wonder if I chose the wrong class.  I'm playing as a berserker and still leveling, and so far 90% of combat is walking up to a pack of mobs and pressing 1 or 2 buttons to delete everything, which is cool the first few times but not super engaging, imo. Hoping to have the time to grind through the rest of the leveling this weekend so I can unlock some of the endgame content and hopefully understand the hype.
        Oh man you should go make new characters and use the class tester to try out a bunch of specs. I think warrior and mage are the most boring classes.

Gunslinger, deathblade, scrapper, sharpshooter, all are really fun with interesting combos - esp deathblade.
            Good call, I'll try out a few more while I grind my way towards the power pass. Gunslinger and Deathblade definitely look interesting, and I'm most excited for when lancemaster comes eventually.
                Ooh I didn't know more were coming. Yeah I want to get the power pass too so I can have the other classes on this server. But apparently u have to complete the main story after 50 which may take a while.
        Honestly mayhem berserker is mostly just like 2 buttons. Once you unlock the power pass I’d look into some of the more complex gameplay classes
            Good to know I'm not the only one who feels that way, wish I'd put more thought into my class selection beyond just going for the big sword. Looking forward to getting the power pass to try other classes.
Thank god, I thought I was going crazy. How are there all these comments about leveling with the “I’ve play xyz MMO” comments but then basically show you’ve never played those games at all? Or maybe they’ve got a giant hate boner for this game? Idk this is such a standard mmo with a semi boring grind to max level where the real game starts.
Exactly this. If you dont like boring leveling process maybe dont play theme park mmos? This is sort of what the leveling process is. A running and dialogue simulator with some skill usage on enemies that are designed for anyone to be able to kill. 

Lost ark just actually makes the last part fun. Lost ark also has a ton of content for casuals and a ton of progression for die hards. This is a really really really good mmo and it is possible that maybe the genre just isnt for you anymore.
I disagree, I found guild wars 2 was pretty unique and pretty fun to level in. It has a pretty unique system that does a good job embracing multiplayer. I also really enjoy lost ark though so I agree with most everything else you said.
    The thing that made leveling in GW2 was the number of "Oh what's that?!" things around  - jump puzzles, vistas, collectibles, area events, etc. to just jump in on to get rid of the monotony of "My child is dying, please go kill 14 Skilabundoos for their venom sacs to make this potion".

Lost Arks has a bit of those with there being a bunch of collectibles/vistas/looking out for the world bosses but GW2 had a TON of them.
        I agree. I’m not crazy about the story in GW2, but the exploration is fantastic.
I guess I valued the quality of the cut scenes/dialogue/story to reel me in rather than only the combat. Rift was my favorite of the ones I listed because the zones were more interactive and changing, with invasions and rifts popping up that you'd have to deal with. GW2 was also fun to level since you could literally do whatever you wanted and level up, with an emphasis on exploring and PVP and such. ESO was another favorite (I forgot to list specifically), since the zones are so beautiful, and most of the quests are actual lines with a story and characters with real voice acting, and choices that matter. TERA was also lovely in terms of how beautiful it was and how engaging the combat was. I didn't hate WoW, it was very fetch-y and required so much time running around from zone to zone, but still the quality of the game and the cut scenes and the story (up until a certain point) was enough to keep me going.

Combat alone \*is\* enough to keep me going, but the questing in Lost Ark is much less combat than it is carrying barrels, talking to someone 3 feet away from someone else and then going back and talking to them, and running from point A to point B. Even when there is combat, generally speaking it's "kill these 3 mobs, even though there's 20 there" and then you walk up and 1-shot them and walk back and talk for another 2 minutes.
    >	I guess I valued the quality of the cut scenes/dialogue/story to reel me in rather than only the combat.

Yeah, that makes sense to me.

I can put up with lackluster combat if the story is good, or vice-versa. But I can see how if you want the story to make you invested in the gameplay, Lost Ark would be a hard sell.

The story gets a little better after North Vern, mainly because (for the most part) NPCs stop showing up after the boss fight and “saving” you from a fight you just won. Also, there are some cool characters and set pieces in Rohendel and Yorn.

But I find it’s Guardian Raids and Abyssal Dungeons that are keeping me engaged.
        Yeah, it's hearing about those dungeons/raids and seeing some of the video of combat and mechanics from those that are mainly the push for me to keep going. I'm optimistic I'll enjoy that part of the game a lot more. Thanks for taking the time to share the info and your experience! Hopefully I'll be starting that content within a few days here. Hearing all of you reply is motivating to keep pushing through.
    > I didn't hate WoW, it was very fetch-y and required so much time running around from zone to zone, but still the quality of the game and the cut scenes and the story (up until a certain point) was enough to keep me going.

This wow experience is extremely foreign to me and makes absolutely no sense to me. WoW has basically zero cutscenes till somewhere around Legion. Mists and a couple others have a few here or there, but vanilla wow has like the intro cinematic and basically nothing else.

Maybe you came to wow after leveling got totally gimped, but vanillas leveling game play was basically 10 days /played with basically no cutscenes, and reading thousands of walls of text from quest givers for your story. No cutscenes, no story explanation, barely any dialogue, just lots of fetching and reading.

GW I kinda understand your perspective one but GW has always had a great leveling/world experience. FFXIV is kind of all over the place as well, but does have a few cutscenes tying it back together, but I generally found that way more dry and even less compelling than Lost Ark. The rest of your list I don't really understand as LA just feels better... Didn't play rift though.

But compare it to any of the previous gen mmos like WOW at least through WOTLK or EVE, or even further into classics like OSRS, UO, EQ, etc and this is just no comparison IMO. This opinion screams to me of more modern theme park mmo experience instead of anything else.
        Came here to say that what you just wrote about wow. As someone who turned to wow vanilla servers as soon as Nostalrius launched and never looked back at retail, i was so confused with his take on wow
            Yeah this is a huge "problem" with discussions about WoW IMO. WoW in 2006 vs 2009 vs 2012 vs 2018 are all entirely different games. Claiming you've "played a lot of wow" is kind of meaningless because we could be talking about like 8 different iterations of the game.

Cinematics and a "story" are parts of modern WoW that did exist for the first third of its lifetime. Comparing WoW in the past few years to LA is very different than comparing vanilla to LA.
                You're right, I didn't play vanilla. I should have been more specific.
You can mouse click instead of g spamming for quests, only need g to accept rewards or accept the quest.
    I've been doing that, too. I've been trying not to spam my way through all the dialogue and cut scenes since I've been holding out some hope with them, but I mean more like "move this barrel" -> G -> climb this rope! -> G -> ride this zipline! -> G -> talk to this person! -> G -> pull this lever! -> G -> Nod at this person! -> G... oh, /nod  


I guess I click some of them, too, but still.
Thanks, I'll keep chugging along then and continue holding out hope!
    I'm sure people told you already, but just in case, rushing through the main story quests definitely gets you there fastest. You can ignore everything else if you want
        I've heard both, I had some other friends telling me not to skip it or I'd have to go back, but then I keep reading that I can ignore all side quest stuff entirely. We're level 43 now, so it won't be that much longer I guess, we're just having trouble staying motivated, and put off playing the last few days as a result. Hoping to hit 50 and start the end-game stuff this weekend, at least. Thanks for the info. :)
            The side quests are completely optional. You don't ever need to go back and do them unless you just want to lol. There may be a select few you'll want the rewards from later, but the majority aren't necessary. Either way, good luck
                That's good to know, I may skip the rest and just push the main quest to finish the story. I appreciate all the info, thanks for taking the time!
    Also of note, you don't really ever need to do the main quest line again.  You get 2 power passes which let you take alts to 50 instantly and then you can spend gold to exchange knowledge in your stronghold to skip the quest for more alts.  So it isn't like you have to slog through that story over and over.
        I did hear about that! I'm thankful for that, since I've been intrigued by the Bard and also want to play a melee character at some point, but the idea of getting from 1-50 again manually is especially daunting at the moment. Appreciate the info!
What you described is exactly what I went into the game hoping for. An ARPG-feel with MMO bossing mehcanics and dungeon/raiding parties. I love a good grind, I just found the game difficult to get into thus far and keep hoping for some more meat to sink my teeth into.
The combat has been the saving grace for me so far, I like the class I'm playing and swapping between the bars and cooldowns, and being mobile and whatnot. I'm hoping once the endgame picks up I'll get to focus more on that and less on the tedious stuff. I don't mind a grind, I have thousands of hours in PoE and the Diablo series, I'm used to it, but those games are all combat which makes the leveling feel better.  


I'll stick with it, thanks. :)
>Knowledge transfer in your Stronghold can automatically bring up a new character to the same progress as your main. Though most recommend at least getting to Tier 2 first before using it.

That's great to know, thank you!
Yeah, the feel of the combat and such, and some of the little boss fights we've done is literally the only thread we're holding onto right now, but it's enough to keep us gently pushing through the game hoping to get into that grind at the end with the majority of the game hopefully being combat instead of moving leaves and barrells and fertilizer around lol  


We're certainly viewing it all as absurd in terms of the story/questing, but I think we lost the humor in it along the way, and just want to fight things.

    I can't think of an MMO where leveling isn't ultra easy.  Pretty much all of them are auto pilot going from place to place and collecting boxes/feathers/bugs/whatever this NPC needs for their mid-life crisis.
        [deleted]
            Imagine an arpg style game where if you pulled too many mobs you died. This is not a game many people would want to play as an mmo (could be good roguelike though!).
                [deleted]
                    What endgame scenario punishes you for pulling multiple trash mobs again?
            While I agree you certainly can't grab nearly as many mobs in WoW as you do in LA, outside of classic which is a balancing nightmare you could grab entire camps and burn them down EASILY.

The only time you really die leveling in WoW is if you go AFK and aggro something.

    Well yeah once. Luckily you're not forced to play the game.  I assume.

Ah ok thanks

Switch it from "available" to "all" to see all the future things you can upgrade and it'll tell you what you need to unlock it.
Anything higher than vern for knowledge transfer is a waste. First your alt needs to already have 460 gear to skip to rohendel otherwise you cant use it. You pay 1k gold to skip 1 hour of questing. It doesnt give gear unless its the first KT which gives 302.
    did not know that. I honestly thought it was similar to a power pass item that you can choose which storyline you want to progress to
        Yeah its weird. I have no idea why anyone would skip an hour of questing for 1k gold. You also have to wait way more than 1 hour to level it up anyway.
            Right now its useless but down the line when the new classes get released and Gold is becoming slowly worthless cuz theres so much around its worth more paying 1k to save 1hr of time. Especially if you want to play like 2-3 new characters. Thats why on my alt im hoarding fragments
            So rohendel one doesn’t even give you ilevel 460 gears?
                Nope. You need to HAVE 460 to even do the transfer.
    so don't do shushire? if i want to stay at 600g?
        Nah I think it skips shushire too. You just choose the first knowledge transfer out of a couple options. It doesnt force you on a specific tier so dont worry. You choose.
Also true, but seldom worth it beyond Vern as the alt must already meet the ilvl requirement for the region you’re skipping.
I believe you only get 1 credit for missing a day, so 2 missed days = 1.5 days of rewards in a 3 day interval. 50% loss which is fine if you're short on time and have a lot of alts.
Thanks :)
Thank you!
Sports/competiton is all about structure, organization and support and then critical mass. The best gamers come from communities where there's plenty of people who help others achieve those competitive goals, something that Korean starcraft players had an advantage in, and Japanese FGC players had for fighting games. 

Its like olympics, more people and more money and more interest = better players once enough time has passed.
MVP phoenix RIP
I'm making a joke about the increase in koreaboos. It's not that deep.
> thousands of hours to "beat" this game.

of course, that's not an issue. My issue was the game so far has been a devil may cry/god of war instead of an mmorpg
    Ah I see. I think that is just typical MMO behavior right? At least in this day and age of MMOs. You level up and quest and basically play story mode or co-op story mode until you get to end game and reveal the rest of the game.
Seeing so many people talk about how fun the combat is, even while leveling,  makes me wonder if I chose the wrong class.  I'm playing as a berserker and still leveling, and so far 90% of combat is walking up to a pack of mobs and pressing 1 or 2 buttons to delete everything, which is cool the first few times but not super engaging, imo. Hoping to have the time to grind through the rest of the leveling this weekend so I can unlock some of the endgame content and hopefully understand the hype.
    Oh man you should go make new characters and use the class tester to try out a bunch of specs. I think warrior and mage are the most boring classes.

Gunslinger, deathblade, scrapper, sharpshooter, all are really fun with interesting combos - esp deathblade.
        Good call, I'll try out a few more while I grind my way towards the power pass. Gunslinger and Deathblade definitely look interesting, and I'm most excited for when lancemaster comes eventually.
            Ooh I didn't know more were coming. Yeah I want to get the power pass too so I can have the other classes on this server. But apparently u have to complete the main story after 50 which may take a while.
    Honestly mayhem berserker is mostly just like 2 buttons. Once you unlock the power pass I’d look into some of the more complex gameplay classes
        Good to know I'm not the only one who feels that way, wish I'd put more thought into my class selection beyond just going for the big sword. Looking forward to getting the power pass to try other classes.
The thing that made leveling in GW2 was the number of "Oh what's that?!" things around  - jump puzzles, vistas, collectibles, area events, etc. to just jump in on to get rid of the monotony of "My child is dying, please go kill 14 Skilabundoos for their venom sacs to make this potion".

Lost Arks has a bit of those with there being a bunch of collectibles/vistas/looking out for the world bosses but GW2 had a TON of them.
    I agree. I’m not crazy about the story in GW2, but the exploration is fantastic.
>	I guess I valued the quality of the cut scenes/dialogue/story to reel me in rather than only the combat.

Yeah, that makes sense to me.

I can put up with lackluster combat if the story is good, or vice-versa. But I can see how if you want the story to make you invested in the gameplay, Lost Ark would be a hard sell.

The story gets a little better after North Vern, mainly because (for the most part) NPCs stop showing up after the boss fight and “saving” you from a fight you just won. Also, there are some cool characters and set pieces in Rohendel and Yorn.

But I find it’s Guardian Raids and Abyssal Dungeons that are keeping me engaged.
    Yeah, it's hearing about those dungeons/raids and seeing some of the video of combat and mechanics from those that are mainly the push for me to keep going. I'm optimistic I'll enjoy that part of the game a lot more. Thanks for taking the time to share the info and your experience! Hopefully I'll be starting that content within a few days here. Hearing all of you reply is motivating to keep pushing through.
> I didn't hate WoW, it was very fetch-y and required so much time running around from zone to zone, but still the quality of the game and the cut scenes and the story (up until a certain point) was enough to keep me going.

This wow experience is extremely foreign to me and makes absolutely no sense to me. WoW has basically zero cutscenes till somewhere around Legion. Mists and a couple others have a few here or there, but vanilla wow has like the intro cinematic and basically nothing else.

Maybe you came to wow after leveling got totally gimped, but vanillas leveling game play was basically 10 days /played with basically no cutscenes, and reading thousands of walls of text from quest givers for your story. No cutscenes, no story explanation, barely any dialogue, just lots of fetching and reading.

GW I kinda understand your perspective one but GW has always had a great leveling/world experience. FFXIV is kind of all over the place as well, but does have a few cutscenes tying it back together, but I generally found that way more dry and even less compelling than Lost Ark. The rest of your list I don't really understand as LA just feels better... Didn't play rift though.

But compare it to any of the previous gen mmos like WOW at least through WOTLK or EVE, or even further into classics like OSRS, UO, EQ, etc and this is just no comparison IMO. This opinion screams to me of more modern theme park mmo experience instead of anything else.
    Came here to say that what you just wrote about wow. As someone who turned to wow vanilla servers as soon as Nostalrius launched and never looked back at retail, i was so confused with his take on wow
        Yeah this is a huge "problem" with discussions about WoW IMO. WoW in 2006 vs 2009 vs 2012 vs 2018 are all entirely different games. Claiming you've "played a lot of wow" is kind of meaningless because we could be talking about like 8 different iterations of the game.

Cinematics and a "story" are parts of modern WoW that did exist for the first third of its lifetime. Comparing WoW in the past few years to LA is very different than comparing vanilla to LA.
            You're right, I didn't play vanilla. I should have been more specific.
I've been doing that, too. I've been trying not to spam my way through all the dialogue and cut scenes since I've been holding out some hope with them, but I mean more like "move this barrel" -> G -> climb this rope! -> G -> ride this zipline! -> G -> talk to this person! -> G -> pull this lever! -> G -> Nod at this person! -> G... oh, /nod  


I guess I click some of them, too, but still.
I'm sure people told you already, but just in case, rushing through the main story quests definitely gets you there fastest. You can ignore everything else if you want
    I've heard both, I had some other friends telling me not to skip it or I'd have to go back, but then I keep reading that I can ignore all side quest stuff entirely. We're level 43 now, so it won't be that much longer I guess, we're just having trouble staying motivated, and put off playing the last few days as a result. Hoping to hit 50 and start the end-game stuff this weekend, at least. Thanks for the info. :)
        The side quests are completely optional. You don't ever need to go back and do them unless you just want to lol. There may be a select few you'll want the rewards from later, but the majority aren't necessary. Either way, good luck

        What endgame scenario punishes you for pulling multiple trash mobs again?
While I agree you certainly can't grab nearly as many mobs in WoW as you do in LA, outside of classic which is a balancing nightmare you could grab entire camps and burn them down EASILY.

The only time you really die leveling in WoW is if you go AFK and aggro something.
Your choice haha, I personally use the daily checklist since Im level 50.3 and the experienced player tips. Also, dont forget to use all of your daily rapport emotes and sheet music
Here is a guide to complete every continent 100% I use https://www.htfgamestudio100.com/
Right now its useless but down the line when the new classes get released and Gold is becoming slowly worthless cuz theres so much around its worth more paying 1k to save 1hr of time. Especially if you want to play like 2-3 new characters. Thats why on my alt im hoarding fragments
So rohendel one doesn’t even give you ilevel 460 gears?
    Nope. You need to HAVE 460 to even do the transfer.
Ooh I didn't know more were coming. Yeah I want to get the power pass too so I can have the other classes on this server. But apparently u have to complete the main story after 50 which may take a while.
You're right, I didn't play vanilla. I should have been more specific.
