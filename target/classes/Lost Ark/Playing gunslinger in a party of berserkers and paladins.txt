[[Playing gunslinger in a party of berserkers and paladins]]





And there I am admist the medival attack on castle Luterra, blasting people by the hundreds of the walls with my magical boomsticks.

Got a good few chuckles out of me.
    My artillerist also felt outta place during that… napalms and flamethrowers about.
        Napalm didn't even feel that out of place for me. Now the constant airstrikes on the other hand....
            The air strike T3 tripod that turns it into one singular nuke may be my favorite.
                Same , dude are out there with sword and board I’m calling in orbital strikes it’s hilarious.
                    Lol spellcasters moving in protected by Paladins, meanwhile Artillerist coordinating B52s
                I must be the only Artillerist main who uses the multi-hit on Air Raid. I like the CC triggers more than the flat damage.
                    Honestly I was just following a leveling guide, but may try out some different stuff closer to 50. That sounds good too
                        It shines in Dungeons as far as I've seen. Being able to chain stagger large groups of enemies while harder hitting DPS classes can safely and accurately light them up is super satisfying.
                            probably my favorite part of the game is how these choices are actually viable, i love all the skill customization available
                What about the homing missle that straight up nukes enemies
        Weirdly, I felt like everyone else missed the memo at that siege but my Artillerist. Like, what, are you all really trying to fight this collossal demon king WITHOUT this Lightning Plasma Cannon? Magic? Swords? How uncivilized....
        I felt like Ash in Evil Dead :D
        That's because each archetype (warrior, mage, fighter, gunner, assassin) comes from a different continent, so some of them could feel out of place. Gunners (deadeye, gunslinger, sharpshooter, artillerist) come from Arthentine, so ,naturally, they look and feel more advanced or (machinist) outright futuristic! While warriors feel right at home in Luterra with them coming from Shushire and mages coming from Rohendel. Martial artists from Anika and I suppose assassins come, either from Yorn or Feiton because I haven't really been there, yet.
        Wait till the scout class comes out
    My favorite is attending a martial arts tournament with guns. Feel like that's grounds for disqualification.
        The bird guy will call you out for bringing a magic gourd to his fight, but doesn't care about the shotgun
            I had a chuckle on that fight because I didn't use the gourd. Just kept blasting everything once I noticed you still do damage even when he's invisible. He still whines like you used it.
            Me as a Sorc to him: *that* is what you are taking issue with?
        The Equilibrium movie has entered the chat.
            One of my favorite Deadeye skills
        [Explosives are a legitimate martial art!](https://i.imgur.com/N2Pasbu.jpg)
            Fine, fine! 
**straps explosions to a stick** it's a Lance. It does poke poke smash lance-stuff, ^and ^^also ^^goes ^^^boom, OK?? 

I have to admit though, my favorite part of the Luterra Wall scene was gunlance's howl. Literally jumped into the courtyard, backhopped backwards into the giant mob, and got told off by a guard to stop all that... shouting. 

Something about making people nervous or whatever..
                Ye Olde Wild West, home of the Gunlance Jousting.
        Not that different from Vega bringing claws to Street Fighter.
    I play paladin and felt it was epic and perfect with the class, but for a few seconds I imagined what it would be like with a gunslinger. I love thinking about how different it may look and feel like in one's imaginary.
    Lol yes. That’s one of the things that still weirds me out about this game.

Nothing like riding a horse past robots and computer screens in Arthetine.
        Is it that weird really? I mean the technological difference between the US and Africa for example is pretty huge. It doesn't surprise me in a game where you can manipulate souls and mana and all this other stuff that people who didn't have that advantage would have had to go the weapons route to keep up.
            I'm mostly puzzled as to why Luterra is basically pre-industrial era while Arthetine is well, Arthetine.
        How about that horse shit Roomba they have going around? That thing is diligent!

    Especially when the king names you "King's Knight". I was like "Bruh, you are naming me, the female magus in high heels, a 'knight' ?"
        TIL people don't know knight is a also a Title...
            Yeah yeah you are very smart and all, got it. You and the dozen other people who said the exact same thing that is. So, here, I give you the title of smarty-pants, be proud.

Still, I find it funny to name a magus "knight", in the context of a medieval kingdom of knights, with a knight king in sword and armor, alongside his army of knights with swords and armors.
                Ah yes..very odd that a king would 'Knight' his most loyal servant and protector. I get that it feels out of tune, but don't start getting angry with me when you make something weird that obviously isn't. Also why are you giving me the title of smarty-pants while I'm not wearing pants, huh?! We cool bro dont be so angry towards internet strangers we're not worth it
                    if you bothered to check before explaining you would've known that 'Knight' is an INCORRECT title for Female. While granting knighthood is a term for both men and women, the correct terms would be 'Knight' for male and 'Dame' for female. And yes - it was possible for a woman to get 'knighted' \[i.e. to be granted knighthood'\], though the term used would've been 'Dame'. If we want to be exact then we should've used term 'damehood' and 'granted damehood', though I did use the incorrect term to show connection between the two versions of the same title.

In fact - this is the title used currently in the UK, for example by Dame Judi Dench and Dame Maggie Smith, 

So yes - complaining about being 'Knight' when female IS valid issue. Just not due to your perceived problem with 'I dun' use typical knight gear', but it is an issue about using correct title.
                        > complaining about being 'Knight' when female IS valid issue.

Sure if this was the UK. But it's not. It's Luterra. So unless there is something in the games lore that says knighted women are "Dames", you are just projecting UK customs onto a completely different kingdom which may have completely different rules and customs.
                            I used current UK to show title as is being used now and happens to be direct 1:1 conversion of 'knight' title historically.

Also - historically - many countries that did in fact recognize women in that rank would include their specific words for the title itself when granted to women. 

Examples include: 

Дама  
Витез  
Dam  
Bruņiniece  
Ντάμα

&#x200B;

It MIGHT have something to do that unlike in English - in Majority of languages in Europe there is such a thing as grammatical gender. Ironically - one of two that were prominent languages in Europe back in the medieval times \[Irish, English\] that do not - still have such distinction \[Knight/Dame as mentioned before\].

Yes - it is Luterra - devs have the right to chose any word they want. Why then choose a knight, that has historic connotations and is customary title for minor nobility in Europe, with regional versions? The answer? BECAUSE it has those connotations and cultural meaning that has been ingrained in popular subconsciousness. 

Hell, why not add a rank of 'knight' as a reward in tournament in different fantasy area? Because it simply would not 'fit' the theme of that area. Why? See above.

No - I am NOT projecting 'UK customs' - I am writing regarding historic context that the word was used, and here's the deal - STILL IS in reality. And fun fact - there is no monarchy that grants title of that rank that does not have that distinction to my knowledge. 

UK is country with monarchy that is most active when it comes to titles and nobility \[which might be because of having quite a few countries under their belt as the 'commonwealth'\]? Ooooh noooo. How dare they.

&#x200B;

Point stays - if you want to use existing word - keep with its' meaning.

If you want to use a word as you want - make sure the word does not have preexisting meaning that is not valid for that specific use. That is the position that I wrote about as a reason for complaining.
                                You’re point is irrelevant. None of that matters. It’s a game and a made up place. Maybe Luterra did a away with some gender specific titles. History means nothing here. The title existing in outside the game has no relevance.
                                    Again - if you want benefits from preexisting meaning and connotations of a word - use the word as it is. If you want to ignore meaning and connotations - don't be surprised that people complain about it. It's that simple.

  
Also - I'd like to add a grammar-nazi mantra, completely unrelated to the discussion itself:  
Grammar is knowing the difference between knowing your shit and knowing  you're shit.
                        You're right! But as you also stated this wasn't the point being made. Nice catch tho, that completely went over my head!
                            Fair enough; I must admit the part where he wanted a sword and armor was a thing I did miss.
                No need to get so defensive, damn
         Not all knights carry swords or even armour ..
            Shut up Meg
                 Go home dad ye drunk....
        Technically it's a fancy title for a Noble rank, a seemingly very important rank given there's apparently only been a few and we are the most famous one.
        Yeah. That gave me a good chuckle since I just assume my Bard is constantly walking around singing songs by Kansas. And now I am more knightly than all these mother fuckers in giant platemail armor.
        Imagine when artist comes out and luterra’s knight is a brush wielding loli
        Dame doesn't really convey the martial spirit.
        You bet!
    Guy who brings modern weaponry to a fantasy setting feels like its own fantasy trope.
    Loved all the knights talking about honorable combat while I was killing their buddies from half the map away with my boomstick
I had the opposite feeling as a bard coming from fantasyland (luterra, tortyok, anikka) to arthetine going like: "Mate, you guys have guns, tanks and trains. you sure you need me to sing at your enemies?" \^^
    Serenaded a tank until it's self-destructed

I do believe it's much cooler than anything else
    And then there's me, gunlance, suddenly feeling right at home. 

Now excuse me while I find out who I need to shout menacingly at until they strap one of those Mech cannons to my shield...
Funnier still is the class that literally turns into a gundam and shoots lasers
    It's one of the things I like about the art-design. They're not afraid to mix and match ideas, and don't seem bound to one biome or mythology.
        Getting Final Fantasy vibes from this game.

Mostly everyone uses magic, but Arthetine is the Empire and they have g u n s
    What class is that???
        https://youtu.be/Y04udBaxFcM
7:21 scouter class
            Boost saved
                might be saving it for quite a while
                    Apparently it was translated wrong, so we may be getting all missing classes at once.
                        That would be absolutely rad but I honestly kind of doubt it. Maybe at a faster pace than the original release but every new class draws a lot of players back.

I don't know if it would make sense to fire everything at once when they have a very straightforward way to catch the attention of players back.
                            Yeah, I'm all for it if it happens but not expecting it. Really want Artist.
                                Forget gundam, we need Okami
                                I'm looking forward to lancer
                            But do we want any new players back considering that EU literally can't open the game and queue up due to heavy traffic every day after 2pm ?
                                Got a job doing 2-9 pm shifts. Go to bed early and wake up to playing lost ark queue free.

Morning players are friendly and chill too.
                                Steam app on your phone, pop it up during work and start the queue.
                        I am korean and watched the director interview. It was vague. They are coming in 3 months but he never said ‘at once’.
                            Guess we'll see in a couple months what that meant then ahah thank you
                            While you're here, can you please catch me up on the Golden River thing? That's... an *unusual* name for much of English speaking cultures, for... *reasons.*
                                It’s direct transition. Geum Gang Sun. Is his name. Geum direct translation into gold. And Gang is river. Sun is not translated. His name really doesn’t mean that tho probably. 

In Korea, when we name our children, it’s usually done with meaning in each character. Not always tho.
                                    Thanks! I really appreciate that.
                                    Would you show me a phonetic pronunciation of his Korean name?
                                golden river doesn't meant anything.
you are thinking of golden shower
                                    Glad I don't know the actual term.

                            when daddy was talking about the missing classes on crown stream

                                    2-3 months iirc
                            No it wasn't translated wrong. I've listened to it few times to check and he mentioned 2-3 months as time frame for new updates but never said all the classes will come at once.   


Source: I'm Korean
                    Haven't SmileGate said that they want to push out content somewhat rapidly so that's they don't have to manage several different versions of the game?
                        Thats amazing for them and for us
                        I’m def a proponent of pushing for reaching patch parity between Regions as swiftly as possible. The periodic patch envy as a Monster Hunter World PC player felt like always being fat kid last picked in a Sports pug draft.
                            Yeah, I much prefer things to be synchronized internationally and across all platforms when possible. It's frustrating to see other people playing content we don't have access to yet.
                        I heard roadmap is every two months and others are saying 2-3 months. Could be accurate.
                        No idea, but I've never seen a Korean MMO that wasn't months behind on content in NA/EU.
                    If the info about mistranslation was correct, we are getting ALL of the missing classes in 2-3 months. Not that long (:
                        I thought it said they would be releasing them *every* two months meaning it would be more than one release. Which makes sense because it is more opportunities to sell class packs without burning everyone out making them buy all the packs at once. (Or pissing off people because they can't afford that.)
                I heard that on the Korean servers players were given a powerpass when the new classes got released. Might be the same on western servers.
                    Sometimes they did. It was not universal. I *think* they have made that SOP now, but there is the possibility still they won't.
                Just use knowledge transfer and boost something else to play for the next ~3 months
                lol, yep. I'm currently saving one for scouter
            I want to play bigass hammerbro!
                lol, yea that guy is nuts. RU was filled with them.
            You know in hindsight the old names were retarded.
            When does that come out??
            That is amazing looking. But as someone who's only level 14 I hope the lore at least somewhat explains the really confusing mix of simple medieval towns and really hi tech shit at some point.
                Narrator: It doesn't.

This is pretty common in Korean MMOs. Look at Maple Story, when the game first came out you had Warriors, Archers and Mages starting in very much fantasy towns. The mages started in a magical tree, the archers started in a medieval mushroom looking town, and the warriors started out in the mountains as a sort of tribe.

Then you had the Thief class, that started in straight up Chicago, cabs and all.
                    I thought it was detroit
                    I mean MapleStory literally made a spin off that's just set on modern day Earth
                basically the gunners are unable to use magic
they are in fact a different race of human called cykin which are part machine
                I would assume an easy thing would be that while some people are intrinsically born with special abilities they're suited for, regular people who want to fight would have to develop technologically(Like we do IRL). and it seems the technology has reached the level where it can even help people who DO have crazy abilities.
            Damn, why do they release those later? Laser guy looks interesting but ill still use my slinger.
        [deleted]
            Scouter…
    Artillerist are so toxic to face in PvP. Our only option is to run away.
    was sad when they said it won't release as i played it in RU for 3 month's but loved the scouter.
        I have only played on NA but Scouter is the class I cant wait for, hoping it's one of the first classes released to NA in 3 months.
    I'm so waiting for that one
        The Artillerist.
    BRO WTF THIS IS SO OUT OF PLACE AND SO FUCKING COOL
Without spoiling too much, in one of the islands you enter a very 19th century candle-lit mansion. But shortly afterwards you run into a girl with a Walther PPK pistol.

That got quite a laugh out of me.
    I really like how different the islands all are. Like, you're going from following an unbearable marie sue through a knights and demons theme, to fighting anime protagonist rejects in an asian arena and something about weird ghosts, to suddenly steering my medival sailing ship into a steampunk desert with monorails and mechs and whatnot.

My idiot gunlancer who's just here to bonk all kinds of stuff with his boomstick is wildly confused what's going on, but I do enjoy the ride.
        >gunlancer

Why would a **gun**lancer be confused about the technology?
            He's generally confused ;-)
            My berserker is too angry to care.
            Dunno, spending most of the time getting hit in the face by your average house-sized demon might do that to a guy.
            I mean, there's not a lot of technology behind the Gunlance... It's just a Pointy Stick that can go boom
                It's a gun that's also a lance (or a lance that's also a gun), what more is there to explain?
        I cant help but feel like the game director got inspired by all the wildly different islands in One Piece, considering his gaming nickname is literally inspired by the most renown pirate in that anime.

The main characters in One Piece also travel from island to island and they are just as wild as they are in Lost Ark. I really recommend watching it if you havent seen it yet, it's one of the best pieces of modern entertainment that I've ever seen in my life, up there with Lord of the Rings, for example.
            That's a great observation. This game combined traditional sword-and-sorcery with One Piece exploration.
            I didnt think of one piece but u right. Feels like the game combined many cultural hits like one piece and lord of the rings. But the directors name I believe is a direct translation. Geum means gold and Gang means river in korean.
                Yeah, and that's what I mean. I remember in one of the interviews he clarified that his gaming name is actually "Gol D. River" which is a very clear reference to One Piece if you've seen at least the very first episode.

And if you haven't, to save you the few minutes, the most notorious pirate in the anime who also started the Great Pirate Era was called "Gol D. Roger", but they shorten his name to Gold Roger.

Gold River is a literal reference to that.
                    I named my island Raftel lol. What a coincidence.
                Arthetine is clearly inspired from FF7 for instance.
                    Several of the bosses are League references as well, spotted Rengar and Ahri atleast so far.
                        Nine-tailed foxes are pretty prevalent in Asian media. Doubt it's a league reference lmao
                        Also I feel the whole of Soulfist is a dragonball reference
                        I remember the Ahri reference from the Anikka tournament, but where have you seen Rengar?

Genuinely curious as I'm a Rengar/Katarina/Diana OTP in League so I'd like to know if I missed him or just haven't reached that far yet. :D
                            The last boss in [this](https://youtu.be/mNkoCT3jz4o?t=421) place gave me some heavy Rengar vibes and apparently so did for the guy who made the video :D
                                Omfg yea, now that I look at the boss, he does look and fight like Rengar, wtf.

I totally didn't realize it during my initial playthrough cuz I was kinda rushing. xD Thanks for the vid, I appreciate it.
                            Its in the ruins, an early game dungeon in west luterra I believe.
            Also Ragnarok Online is heavy inspiration for Lost Ark and that's showing. 

Deadeye is basically Gunslinger from RO and Einbroch shows everywhere in Arthetine.

Koreans have a thing for Pseudo Nordic mythology as well.
                Don’t forget king’s avatar
        That’s called having no identity. Korean companies struggle with that. Smilegate even threw Warhammer 40k marines in. Same with Hyundai - Korean car manufacturer. When you look at a Hyundai car, you don’t see a Hyundai. You see bits and pieces of BMW, Toyota, Jaguar, Mercedes, Ford. 

I’m not quite sure why gamers think that incoherent mess of hundreds of ideas is good.

If they were isolated to islands - good. But they are in main continents.
            Having a world with many different settings can be interesting, and there's many different ways to have a good world. Final fantasy has always had high tech mixed in, and it's a Japanese game. I'm not quite sure you are able to express the opinions of hundreds of millions of different gamers what they are allowed to think is good or not.
                I am able. Look at gamer PCs, look at workstations from Apple or even Dell. Tasteless man-children.
                    The irony in this post hahaha.
                        The lack of introspection of your own culture haha.
        Every continent felt like a separate single player campaign to me
    I find the smashtogether of High Fantasy, Guns and Martial arts kind of charming in a way. Its a cluster fuck but it just works somehow.
    I wish that island a very pleasant sinking.
Lmao, nice 👌
Glocknado is my favorite move
    Everyone can appreciate some gunfu.
    literally the best.  I love flipping backwards over a huge group and then just john wicking the ever-loving fuck out of them with the glocknado
        John wick goes for efficiency.

[Gun kata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U02E2sjwlLM) goes for style.
    One of their moves is called Equilibrium which animation is pretty much taken straight from the movie Equilibrium.

Wait, are there even axes in this game??
    The Northern lawmaker skin for the Deathblade changes two of her swords into axes.
        We need something similar for Berserker. I love those huge swords but I made more of viking looking character and would love to have huge battleaxe!
            yeah ngl
i mean, i prefer swords, but some of these already look like some weird axe thing with how huge they are at the end of the blade. might as well reskin them to axes
            There were 2 Axe skins for Berserker on RU server if I remember correctly. They were a bit more punkish with spikes and saws here and there, but there was definitely an axe head at the top which made it look super rad. Imagine your sword but with axe head at the top.

I am personally waiting for my Lancemaster to come out and buy another red Scythe :)
        That skin for the gunslinger also puts small hatchet bayonet style on her shotgun and rifle
    How you gonna chop wood
I'm kinda surprised how there is 4 gun(well one has a bow) classes right now but only 2 mage types in a fantasy game.
    There's more, but not in our version. Think there's also Summoner, Artist, and Arcana.
        Isn't Arcana the Sorc? Soul Fist cast spells with her fist.
            No, arcana is a card based caster not in NA/EU yet
                Like Twisted Fate?
                    Haha kinda. Lots of memes when I played in RU called it the Yugioh class.
                    More like Astrologian from FFXIV
            No there is a twisted fate league of legends class. It  applies card counters to enemies and then has abilities that consume them for extra damage. Kind of like a mage rogue with assassinate stacks.
        Artist? 

So some people get to throw fireballs out of their hands and your power is you got a liberal arts degree?
            It’s actually more like an Epic Mickey or Okami kind of thing.
        We need class switch option then. Is there any in Korea?
        Artist is a specialist, not a mage.
    We're missing two more mages which will bring the total up to 4 (Arcana and Summoner).
    Shadowhunter is an hybrid warrior/warlock.
    also idk if youve noticed but neither of the assassins are assassins. deathblade is actually just a slightly more nimble but squishier greatsword class and shadowhunter is a melee mage.
        I just checked some unreleased classes and apparently the one that is missing is the actual class that plays like Rogue/Assassin, I hope they release everything soon.
            yessir
    Yea, I immediately went for the gun classes. I played enough sword/magic/bow type classes in my lifetime. Game creators probably thought of this.
        I don't mind the gun classes but I wish they had a shaman, warlock or nercomancer, maybe even druid would be nice.
            Agreed.

Then the necromancer could be added to the bottom of that photo montage saying: "and your dead brother"  =)
        LMAO I play fantasy games because I'm so fucking tired of how boring guns are and how prevalent they are in EVERYTHING in the US. FPS games drain the life out of me with every bullet
    I just want a pirate (sword&pistol) class.
Gunslinger go brrrr
I wish we had a dwarven class to play, so many cool looking NPC ones.
    funny enough my younger brother said to me on launch "why do we have elves but no dwarfs!?, they look amazing in game"
        The mining trainer looks like a dwarf straight outa Warhammer.
    Man that would be way too hype
And my fist ..
I had to make the achievement for a hoverboard...just to look even more ridiculous, when I hit Vern...
Was a never a fan of guns on fantasy games… this meme makes me feel a bit better
Gunner supremacy
And my portable nuke as an Artillerist
just wait until that hunter class shows up, literal drones and an Iron Man suit
Accurate.
i watched a stream from this underwater-raid last night and they were using walkie-talkies.. wtf
Gunslinger kinda ruins the vibe of this game.
lmao
I’m still sad we can’t be dwarves
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA MY SIDES GOD NO

        or the artillerist.... \^^
My "Friend" plays gunslinger and doesnt get the joke, someone care to explain ?
    The original line is “and my bow.” Paladins use a sword and gunslingers use guns. There’s not much to get.
i watched a stream from this underwater-raid last night and they were using walkie-talkies.. wtf
I refuse to play with class that uses a fireweapon in any mmo... its just ridiulous, doesnt fit at all to me.

&#x200B;

We need characters that uses swords, bow and arrow, axe, scythe, wands, scepter, blades, etc etc.
i watched a stream from this underwater-raid last night and they were using walkie-talkies.. wtf
My reaction to seeing scouter drone when starting the game for the first time... thought it was some star wars cross promotion pet.
I was just thinking this everyone else fits the fantasy then we gave glock
    Forget glock, I am taking down bees with Mk21

Nothin better than having trouble then get that back attack position then solve all your problems with a liberal dose of shotgun!
By axe I mean you have me shredding the electric guitar. Magically of course.
I gotta say the female gunner is the most fun I've had in an mmo since guild wars 2. It feels like you stepped out of a shooter game and you've got a gun for every situation.
My magical shotguns making bodies explode in feudal vern lol
One of the islands has a martial arts tournament, one of the contestants talks about how he needs to train more to defend his faimly's honor... I think he just needs to come next year with a shotgun like I did
Whoever you are who keeps pushing the pack of enemies backwards, making me miss all my dps abilities....I hate you
    Heard deathblade does that:-D
        It's so dumb dude, do they not realise they're fucking up momentum. It makes more sense to do it in the other direction, towards your team.
            Dunno, man. I am playing everything solo so far. I had my partner help me with one boss, other than that... I am so not in the mood to deal with gamer community in general. But it would piss me off, the Mk12 takes time to shoot.
Let's talk
I love this 😂
LOL
So, when are we getting that skin?
Playble dwarf with an axe fucking WHEN? This game has such cool looking dwarfs. Having them only as npcs is a crime.
And my Mossberg....And my 50 cal....And my....bow?
Felt like this playing through the Anikka continent as well. Fighting all these great martial artist masters.... with a shotgun.
Glock Saint Isshin: Hesitation is defeat
What's this? A "martial arts" tournament? Please, tell me more. *loading my dual pistols, shotgun and rifle*
I love the gunslinger but man I keep getting smacked around in pvp it’s so hard but so fun
Scrolled down and almost spit out my beer lmfao.
...and my tactical nuke.
Wait til [scouter](https://imgur.com/a/5f4InMX) releases....
LMAO
My artillerist also felt outta place during that… napalms and flamethrowers about.
    Napalm didn't even feel that out of place for me. Now the constant airstrikes on the other hand....
        The air strike T3 tripod that turns it into one singular nuke may be my favorite.
            Same , dude are out there with sword and board I’m calling in orbital strikes it’s hilarious.
                Lol spellcasters moving in protected by Paladins, meanwhile Artillerist coordinating B52s
            I must be the only Artillerist main who uses the multi-hit on Air Raid. I like the CC triggers more than the flat damage.
                Honestly I was just following a leveling guide, but may try out some different stuff closer to 50. That sounds good too
                    It shines in Dungeons as far as I've seen. Being able to chain stagger large groups of enemies while harder hitting DPS classes can safely and accurately light them up is super satisfying.
                        probably my favorite part of the game is how these choices are actually viable, i love all the skill customization available
            What about the homing missle that straight up nukes enemies
    Weirdly, I felt like everyone else missed the memo at that siege but my Artillerist. Like, what, are you all really trying to fight this collossal demon king WITHOUT this Lightning Plasma Cannon? Magic? Swords? How uncivilized....
    I felt like Ash in Evil Dead :D
    That's because each archetype (warrior, mage, fighter, gunner, assassin) comes from a different continent, so some of them could feel out of place. Gunners (deadeye, gunslinger, sharpshooter, artillerist) come from Arthentine, so ,naturally, they look and feel more advanced or (machinist) outright futuristic! While warriors feel right at home in Luterra with them coming from Shushire and mages coming from Rohendel. Martial artists from Anika and I suppose assassins come, either from Yorn or Feiton because I haven't really been there, yet.
    Wait till the scout class comes out
My favorite is attending a martial arts tournament with guns. Feel like that's grounds for disqualification.
    The bird guy will call you out for bringing a magic gourd to his fight, but doesn't care about the shotgun
        I had a chuckle on that fight because I didn't use the gourd. Just kept blasting everything once I noticed you still do damage even when he's invisible. He still whines like you used it.
        Me as a Sorc to him: *that* is what you are taking issue with?
    The Equilibrium movie has entered the chat.

        Fine, fine! 
**straps explosions to a stick** it's a Lance. It does poke poke smash lance-stuff, ^and ^^also ^^goes ^^^boom, OK?? 

I have to admit though, my favorite part of the Luterra Wall scene was gunlance's howl. Literally jumped into the courtyard, backhopped backwards into the giant mob, and got told off by a guard to stop all that... shouting. 

Something about making people nervous or whatever..
            Ye Olde Wild West, home of the Gunlance Jousting.
    Not that different from Vega bringing claws to Street Fighter.
I play paladin and felt it was epic and perfect with the class, but for a few seconds I imagined what it would be like with a gunslinger. I love thinking about how different it may look and feel like in one's imaginary.
Lol yes. That’s one of the things that still weirds me out about this game.

Nothing like riding a horse past robots and computer screens in Arthetine.
    Is it that weird really? I mean the technological difference between the US and Africa for example is pretty huge. It doesn't surprise me in a game where you can manipulate souls and mana and all this other stuff that people who didn't have that advantage would have had to go the weapons route to keep up.
        I'm mostly puzzled as to why Luterra is basically pre-industrial era while Arthetine is well, Arthetine.
    How about that horse shit Roomba they have going around? That thing is diligent!

Especially when the king names you "King's Knight". I was like "Bruh, you are naming me, the female magus in high heels, a 'knight' ?"
    TIL people don't know knight is a also a Title...
        Yeah yeah you are very smart and all, got it. You and the dozen other people who said the exact same thing that is. So, here, I give you the title of smarty-pants, be proud.

Still, I find it funny to name a magus "knight", in the context of a medieval kingdom of knights, with a knight king in sword and armor, alongside his army of knights with swords and armors.
            Ah yes..very odd that a king would 'Knight' his most loyal servant and protector. I get that it feels out of tune, but don't start getting angry with me when you make something weird that obviously isn't. Also why are you giving me the title of smarty-pants while I'm not wearing pants, huh?! We cool bro dont be so angry towards internet strangers we're not worth it
                if you bothered to check before explaining you would've known that 'Knight' is an INCORRECT title for Female. While granting knighthood is a term for both men and women, the correct terms would be 'Knight' for male and 'Dame' for female. And yes - it was possible for a woman to get 'knighted' \[i.e. to be granted knighthood'\], though the term used would've been 'Dame'. If we want to be exact then we should've used term 'damehood' and 'granted damehood', though I did use the incorrect term to show connection between the two versions of the same title.

In fact - this is the title used currently in the UK, for example by Dame Judi Dench and Dame Maggie Smith, 

So yes - complaining about being 'Knight' when female IS valid issue. Just not due to your perceived problem with 'I dun' use typical knight gear', but it is an issue about using correct title.
                    > complaining about being 'Knight' when female IS valid issue.

Sure if this was the UK. But it's not. It's Luterra. So unless there is something in the games lore that says knighted women are "Dames", you are just projecting UK customs onto a completely different kingdom which may have completely different rules and customs.
                        I used current UK to show title as is being used now and happens to be direct 1:1 conversion of 'knight' title historically.

Also - historically - many countries that did in fact recognize women in that rank would include their specific words for the title itself when granted to women. 

Examples include: 

Дама  
Витез  
Dam  
Bruņiniece  
Ντάμα

&#x200B;

It MIGHT have something to do that unlike in English - in Majority of languages in Europe there is such a thing as grammatical gender. Ironically - one of two that were prominent languages in Europe back in the medieval times \[Irish, English\] that do not - still have such distinction \[Knight/Dame as mentioned before\].

Yes - it is Luterra - devs have the right to chose any word they want. Why then choose a knight, that has historic connotations and is customary title for minor nobility in Europe, with regional versions? The answer? BECAUSE it has those connotations and cultural meaning that has been ingrained in popular subconsciousness. 

Hell, why not add a rank of 'knight' as a reward in tournament in different fantasy area? Because it simply would not 'fit' the theme of that area. Why? See above.

No - I am NOT projecting 'UK customs' - I am writing regarding historic context that the word was used, and here's the deal - STILL IS in reality. And fun fact - there is no monarchy that grants title of that rank that does not have that distinction to my knowledge. 

UK is country with monarchy that is most active when it comes to titles and nobility \[which might be because of having quite a few countries under their belt as the 'commonwealth'\]? Ooooh noooo. How dare they.

&#x200B;

Point stays - if you want to use existing word - keep with its' meaning.

If you want to use a word as you want - make sure the word does not have preexisting meaning that is not valid for that specific use. That is the position that I wrote about as a reason for complaining.
                            You’re point is irrelevant. None of that matters. It’s a game and a made up place. Maybe Luterra did a away with some gender specific titles. History means nothing here. The title existing in outside the game has no relevance.
                                Again - if you want benefits from preexisting meaning and connotations of a word - use the word as it is. If you want to ignore meaning and connotations - don't be surprised that people complain about it. It's that simple.

  
Also - I'd like to add a grammar-nazi mantra, completely unrelated to the discussion itself:  
Grammar is knowing the difference between knowing your shit and knowing  you're shit.
                    You're right! But as you also stated this wasn't the point being made. Nice catch tho, that completely went over my head!
                        Fair enough; I must admit the part where he wanted a sword and armor was a thing I did miss.
            No need to get so defensive, damn
     Not all knights carry swords or even armour ..
        Shut up Meg
             Go home dad ye drunk....
    Technically it's a fancy title for a Noble rank, a seemingly very important rank given there's apparently only been a few and we are the most famous one.
    Yeah. That gave me a good chuckle since I just assume my Bard is constantly walking around singing songs by Kansas. And now I am more knightly than all these mother fuckers in giant platemail armor.
    Imagine when artist comes out and luterra’s knight is a brush wielding loli
    Dame doesn't really convey the martial spirit.
    You bet!
Guy who brings modern weaponry to a fantasy setting feels like its own fantasy trope.
Loved all the knights talking about honorable combat while I was killing their buddies from half the map away with my boomstick
Serenaded a tank until it's self-destructed

I do believe it's much cooler than anything else
And then there's me, gunlance, suddenly feeling right at home. 

Now excuse me while I find out who I need to shout menacingly at until they strap one of those Mech cannons to my shield...
It's one of the things I like about the art-design. They're not afraid to mix and match ideas, and don't seem bound to one biome or mythology.
    Getting Final Fantasy vibes from this game.

Mostly everyone uses magic, but Arthetine is the Empire and they have g u n s
What class is that???
    https://youtu.be/Y04udBaxFcM
7:21 scouter class
        Boost saved
            might be saving it for quite a while
                Apparently it was translated wrong, so we may be getting all missing classes at once.
                    That would be absolutely rad but I honestly kind of doubt it. Maybe at a faster pace than the original release but every new class draws a lot of players back.

I don't know if it would make sense to fire everything at once when they have a very straightforward way to catch the attention of players back.
                        Yeah, I'm all for it if it happens but not expecting it. Really want Artist.
                            Forget gundam, we need Okami
                            I'm looking forward to lancer
                        But do we want any new players back considering that EU literally can't open the game and queue up due to heavy traffic every day after 2pm ?
                            Got a job doing 2-9 pm shifts. Go to bed early and wake up to playing lost ark queue free.

Morning players are friendly and chill too.
                            Steam app on your phone, pop it up during work and start the queue.
                    I am korean and watched the director interview. It was vague. They are coming in 3 months but he never said ‘at once’.
                        Guess we'll see in a couple months what that meant then ahah thank you
                        While you're here, can you please catch me up on the Golden River thing? That's... an *unusual* name for much of English speaking cultures, for... *reasons.*
                            It’s direct transition. Geum Gang Sun. Is his name. Geum direct translation into gold. And Gang is river. Sun is not translated. His name really doesn’t mean that tho probably. 

In Korea, when we name our children, it’s usually done with meaning in each character. Not always tho.
                                Thanks! I really appreciate that.
                                Would you show me a phonetic pronunciation of his Korean name?
                            golden river doesn't meant anything.
you are thinking of golden shower
                                Glad I don't know the actual term.

                        No it wasn't translated wrong. I've listened to it few times to check and he mentioned 2-3 months as time frame for new updates but never said all the classes will come at once.   


Source: I'm Korean
                Haven't SmileGate said that they want to push out content somewhat rapidly so that's they don't have to manage several different versions of the game?
                    Thats amazing for them and for us
                    I’m def a proponent of pushing for reaching patch parity between Regions as swiftly as possible. The periodic patch envy as a Monster Hunter World PC player felt like always being fat kid last picked in a Sports pug draft.
                        Yeah, I much prefer things to be synchronized internationally and across all platforms when possible. It's frustrating to see other people playing content we don't have access to yet.
                    I heard roadmap is every two months and others are saying 2-3 months. Could be accurate.
                    No idea, but I've never seen a Korean MMO that wasn't months behind on content in NA/EU.
                If the info about mistranslation was correct, we are getting ALL of the missing classes in 2-3 months. Not that long (:
                    I thought it said they would be releasing them *every* two months meaning it would be more than one release. Which makes sense because it is more opportunities to sell class packs without burning everyone out making them buy all the packs at once. (Or pissing off people because they can't afford that.)
            I heard that on the Korean servers players were given a powerpass when the new classes got released. Might be the same on western servers.
                Sometimes they did. It was not universal. I *think* they have made that SOP now, but there is the possibility still they won't.
            Just use knowledge transfer and boost something else to play for the next ~3 months
            lol, yep. I'm currently saving one for scouter
        I want to play bigass hammerbro!
            lol, yea that guy is nuts. RU was filled with them.
        You know in hindsight the old names were retarded.
        When does that come out??
        That is amazing looking. But as someone who's only level 14 I hope the lore at least somewhat explains the really confusing mix of simple medieval towns and really hi tech shit at some point.
            Narrator: It doesn't.

This is pretty common in Korean MMOs. Look at Maple Story, when the game first came out you had Warriors, Archers and Mages starting in very much fantasy towns. The mages started in a magical tree, the archers started in a medieval mushroom looking town, and the warriors started out in the mountains as a sort of tribe.

Then you had the Thief class, that started in straight up Chicago, cabs and all.
                I thought it was detroit
                I mean MapleStory literally made a spin off that's just set on modern day Earth
            basically the gunners are unable to use magic
they are in fact a different race of human called cykin which are part machine
            I would assume an easy thing would be that while some people are intrinsically born with special abilities they're suited for, regular people who want to fight would have to develop technologically(Like we do IRL). and it seems the technology has reached the level where it can even help people who DO have crazy abilities.
        Damn, why do they release those later? Laser guy looks interesting but ill still use my slinger.

        Scouter…
Artillerist are so toxic to face in PvP. Our only option is to run away.
was sad when they said it won't release as i played it in RU for 3 month's but loved the scouter.
    I have only played on NA but Scouter is the class I cant wait for, hoping it's one of the first classes released to NA in 3 months.
I'm so waiting for that one
    The Artillerist.
BRO WTF THIS IS SO OUT OF PLACE AND SO FUCKING COOL
I really like how different the islands all are. Like, you're going from following an unbearable marie sue through a knights and demons theme, to fighting anime protagonist rejects in an asian arena and something about weird ghosts, to suddenly steering my medival sailing ship into a steampunk desert with monorails and mechs and whatnot.

My idiot gunlancer who's just here to bonk all kinds of stuff with his boomstick is wildly confused what's going on, but I do enjoy the ride.
    >gunlancer

Why would a **gun**lancer be confused about the technology?
        He's generally confused ;-)
        My berserker is too angry to care.
        Dunno, spending most of the time getting hit in the face by your average house-sized demon might do that to a guy.
        I mean, there's not a lot of technology behind the Gunlance... It's just a Pointy Stick that can go boom
            It's a gun that's also a lance (or a lance that's also a gun), what more is there to explain?
    I cant help but feel like the game director got inspired by all the wildly different islands in One Piece, considering his gaming nickname is literally inspired by the most renown pirate in that anime.

The main characters in One Piece also travel from island to island and they are just as wild as they are in Lost Ark. I really recommend watching it if you havent seen it yet, it's one of the best pieces of modern entertainment that I've ever seen in my life, up there with Lord of the Rings, for example.
        That's a great observation. This game combined traditional sword-and-sorcery with One Piece exploration.
        I didnt think of one piece but u right. Feels like the game combined many cultural hits like one piece and lord of the rings. But the directors name I believe is a direct translation. Geum means gold and Gang means river in korean.
            Yeah, and that's what I mean. I remember in one of the interviews he clarified that his gaming name is actually "Gol D. River" which is a very clear reference to One Piece if you've seen at least the very first episode.

And if you haven't, to save you the few minutes, the most notorious pirate in the anime who also started the Great Pirate Era was called "Gol D. Roger", but they shorten his name to Gold Roger.

Gold River is a literal reference to that.
                I named my island Raftel lol. What a coincidence.
            Arthetine is clearly inspired from FF7 for instance.
                Several of the bosses are League references as well, spotted Rengar and Ahri atleast so far.
                    Nine-tailed foxes are pretty prevalent in Asian media. Doubt it's a league reference lmao
                    Also I feel the whole of Soulfist is a dragonball reference
                    I remember the Ahri reference from the Anikka tournament, but where have you seen Rengar?

Genuinely curious as I'm a Rengar/Katarina/Diana OTP in League so I'd like to know if I missed him or just haven't reached that far yet. :D
                        The last boss in [this](https://youtu.be/mNkoCT3jz4o?t=421) place gave me some heavy Rengar vibes and apparently so did for the guy who made the video :D
                            Omfg yea, now that I look at the boss, he does look and fight like Rengar, wtf.

I totally didn't realize it during my initial playthrough cuz I was kinda rushing. xD Thanks for the vid, I appreciate it.
                        Its in the ruins, an early game dungeon in west luterra I believe.
        Also Ragnarok Online is heavy inspiration for Lost Ark and that's showing. 

Deadeye is basically Gunslinger from RO and Einbroch shows everywhere in Arthetine.

Koreans have a thing for Pseudo Nordic mythology as well.
            Don’t forget king’s avatar
    That’s called having no identity. Korean companies struggle with that. Smilegate even threw Warhammer 40k marines in. Same with Hyundai - Korean car manufacturer. When you look at a Hyundai car, you don’t see a Hyundai. You see bits and pieces of BMW, Toyota, Jaguar, Mercedes, Ford. 

I’m not quite sure why gamers think that incoherent mess of hundreds of ideas is good.

If they were isolated to islands - good. But they are in main continents.
        Having a world with many different settings can be interesting, and there's many different ways to have a good world. Final fantasy has always had high tech mixed in, and it's a Japanese game. I'm not quite sure you are able to express the opinions of hundreds of millions of different gamers what they are allowed to think is good or not.
            I am able. Look at gamer PCs, look at workstations from Apple or even Dell. Tasteless man-children.
                The irony in this post hahaha.
                    The lack of introspection of your own culture haha.
    Every continent felt like a separate single player campaign to me
I find the smashtogether of High Fantasy, Guns and Martial arts kind of charming in a way. Its a cluster fuck but it just works somehow.
I wish that island a very pleasant sinking.
Everyone can appreciate some gunfu.
literally the best.  I love flipping backwards over a huge group and then just john wicking the ever-loving fuck out of them with the glocknado
    John wick goes for efficiency.

[Gun kata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U02E2sjwlLM) goes for style.
One of their moves is called Equilibrium which animation is pretty much taken straight from the movie Equilibrium.

The Northern lawmaker skin for the Deathblade changes two of her swords into axes.
    We need something similar for Berserker. I love those huge swords but I made more of viking looking character and would love to have huge battleaxe!
        yeah ngl
i mean, i prefer swords, but some of these already look like some weird axe thing with how huge they are at the end of the blade. might as well reskin them to axes
        There were 2 Axe skins for Berserker on RU server if I remember correctly. They were a bit more punkish with spikes and saws here and there, but there was definitely an axe head at the top which made it look super rad. Imagine your sword but with axe head at the top.

I am personally waiting for my Lancemaster to come out and buy another red Scythe :)
    That skin for the gunslinger also puts small hatchet bayonet style on her shotgun and rifle
How you gonna chop wood
There's more, but not in our version. Think there's also Summoner, Artist, and Arcana.
    Isn't Arcana the Sorc? Soul Fist cast spells with her fist.
        No, arcana is a card based caster not in NA/EU yet
            Like Twisted Fate?
                Haha kinda. Lots of memes when I played in RU called it the Yugioh class.
                More like Astrologian from FFXIV
        No there is a twisted fate league of legends class. It  applies card counters to enemies and then has abilities that consume them for extra damage. Kind of like a mage rogue with assassinate stacks.
    Artist? 

So some people get to throw fireballs out of their hands and your power is you got a liberal arts degree?
        It’s actually more like an Epic Mickey or Okami kind of thing.
    We need class switch option then. Is there any in Korea?
    Artist is a specialist, not a mage.
We're missing two more mages which will bring the total up to 4 (Arcana and Summoner).
Shadowhunter is an hybrid warrior/warlock.
also idk if youve noticed but neither of the assassins are assassins. deathblade is actually just a slightly more nimble but squishier greatsword class and shadowhunter is a melee mage.
    I just checked some unreleased classes and apparently the one that is missing is the actual class that plays like Rogue/Assassin, I hope they release everything soon.
        yessir
Yea, I immediately went for the gun classes. I played enough sword/magic/bow type classes in my lifetime. Game creators probably thought of this.
    I don't mind the gun classes but I wish they had a shaman, warlock or nercomancer, maybe even druid would be nice.
        Agreed.

Then the necromancer could be added to the bottom of that photo montage saying: "and your dead brother"  =)
    LMAO I play fantasy games because I'm so fucking tired of how boring guns are and how prevalent they are in EVERYTHING in the US. FPS games drain the life out of me with every bullet
I just want a pirate (sword&pistol) class.
funny enough my younger brother said to me on launch "why do we have elves but no dwarfs!?, they look amazing in game"
    The mining trainer looks like a dwarf straight outa Warhammer.
Man that would be way too hype
[removed]
    or the artillerist.... \^^
The original line is “and my bow.” Paladins use a sword and gunslingers use guns. There’s not much to get.
Forget glock, I am taking down bees with Mk21

Heard deathblade does that:-D
    It's so dumb dude, do they not realise they're fucking up momentum. It makes more sense to do it in the other direction, towards your team.
        Dunno, man. I am playing everything solo so far. I had my partner help me with one boss, other than that... I am so not in the mood to deal with gamer community in general. But it would piss me off, the Mk12 takes time to shoot.
Napalm didn't even feel that out of place for me. Now the constant airstrikes on the other hand....
    The air strike T3 tripod that turns it into one singular nuke may be my favorite.
        Same , dude are out there with sword and board I’m calling in orbital strikes it’s hilarious.
            Lol spellcasters moving in protected by Paladins, meanwhile Artillerist coordinating B52s
        I must be the only Artillerist main who uses the multi-hit on Air Raid. I like the CC triggers more than the flat damage.
            Honestly I was just following a leveling guide, but may try out some different stuff closer to 50. That sounds good too
                It shines in Dungeons as far as I've seen. Being able to chain stagger large groups of enemies while harder hitting DPS classes can safely and accurately light them up is super satisfying.
                    probably my favorite part of the game is how these choices are actually viable, i love all the skill customization available
        What about the homing missle that straight up nukes enemies
Weirdly, I felt like everyone else missed the memo at that siege but my Artillerist. Like, what, are you all really trying to fight this collossal demon king WITHOUT this Lightning Plasma Cannon? Magic? Swords? How uncivilized....
I felt like Ash in Evil Dead :D
That's because each archetype (warrior, mage, fighter, gunner, assassin) comes from a different continent, so some of them could feel out of place. Gunners (deadeye, gunslinger, sharpshooter, artillerist) come from Arthentine, so ,naturally, they look and feel more advanced or (machinist) outright futuristic! While warriors feel right at home in Luterra with them coming from Shushire and mages coming from Rohendel. Martial artists from Anika and I suppose assassins come, either from Yorn or Feiton because I haven't really been there, yet.
Wait till the scout class comes out
The bird guy will call you out for bringing a magic gourd to his fight, but doesn't care about the shotgun
    I had a chuckle on that fight because I didn't use the gourd. Just kept blasting everything once I noticed you still do damage even when he's invisible. He still whines like you used it.
    Me as a Sorc to him: *that* is what you are taking issue with?
The Equilibrium movie has entered the chat.
    One of my favorite Deadeye skills
[Explosives are a legitimate martial art!](https://i.imgur.com/N2Pasbu.jpg)
    Fine, fine! 
**straps explosions to a stick** it's a Lance. It does poke poke smash lance-stuff, ^and ^^also ^^goes ^^^boom, OK?? 

I have to admit though, my favorite part of the Luterra Wall scene was gunlance's howl. Literally jumped into the courtyard, backhopped backwards into the giant mob, and got told off by a guard to stop all that... shouting. 

Something about making people nervous or whatever..
        Ye Olde Wild West, home of the Gunlance Jousting.
Not that different from Vega bringing claws to Street Fighter.
Is it that weird really? I mean the technological difference between the US and Africa for example is pretty huge. It doesn't surprise me in a game where you can manipulate souls and mana and all this other stuff that people who didn't have that advantage would have had to go the weapons route to keep up.
    I'm mostly puzzled as to why Luterra is basically pre-industrial era while Arthetine is well, Arthetine.
How about that horse shit Roomba they have going around? That thing is diligent!

TIL people don't know knight is a also a Title...
    Yeah yeah you are very smart and all, got it. You and the dozen other people who said the exact same thing that is. So, here, I give you the title of smarty-pants, be proud.

Still, I find it funny to name a magus "knight", in the context of a medieval kingdom of knights, with a knight king in sword and armor, alongside his army of knights with swords and armors.
        Ah yes..very odd that a king would 'Knight' his most loyal servant and protector. I get that it feels out of tune, but don't start getting angry with me when you make something weird that obviously isn't. Also why are you giving me the title of smarty-pants while I'm not wearing pants, huh?! We cool bro dont be so angry towards internet strangers we're not worth it
            if you bothered to check before explaining you would've known that 'Knight' is an INCORRECT title for Female. While granting knighthood is a term for both men and women, the correct terms would be 'Knight' for male and 'Dame' for female. And yes - it was possible for a woman to get 'knighted' \[i.e. to be granted knighthood'\], though the term used would've been 'Dame'. If we want to be exact then we should've used term 'damehood' and 'granted damehood', though I did use the incorrect term to show connection between the two versions of the same title.

In fact - this is the title used currently in the UK, for example by Dame Judi Dench and Dame Maggie Smith, 

So yes - complaining about being 'Knight' when female IS valid issue. Just not due to your perceived problem with 'I dun' use typical knight gear', but it is an issue about using correct title.
                > complaining about being 'Knight' when female IS valid issue.

Sure if this was the UK. But it's not. It's Luterra. So unless there is something in the games lore that says knighted women are "Dames", you are just projecting UK customs onto a completely different kingdom which may have completely different rules and customs.
                    I used current UK to show title as is being used now and happens to be direct 1:1 conversion of 'knight' title historically.

Also - historically - many countries that did in fact recognize women in that rank would include their specific words for the title itself when granted to women. 

Examples include: 

Дама  
Витез  
Dam  
Bruņiniece  
Ντάμα

&#x200B;

It MIGHT have something to do that unlike in English - in Majority of languages in Europe there is such a thing as grammatical gender. Ironically - one of two that were prominent languages in Europe back in the medieval times \[Irish, English\] that do not - still have such distinction \[Knight/Dame as mentioned before\].

Yes - it is Luterra - devs have the right to chose any word they want. Why then choose a knight, that has historic connotations and is customary title for minor nobility in Europe, with regional versions? The answer? BECAUSE it has those connotations and cultural meaning that has been ingrained in popular subconsciousness. 

Hell, why not add a rank of 'knight' as a reward in tournament in different fantasy area? Because it simply would not 'fit' the theme of that area. Why? See above.

No - I am NOT projecting 'UK customs' - I am writing regarding historic context that the word was used, and here's the deal - STILL IS in reality. And fun fact - there is no monarchy that grants title of that rank that does not have that distinction to my knowledge. 

UK is country with monarchy that is most active when it comes to titles and nobility \[which might be because of having quite a few countries under their belt as the 'commonwealth'\]? Ooooh noooo. How dare they.

&#x200B;

Point stays - if you want to use existing word - keep with its' meaning.

If you want to use a word as you want - make sure the word does not have preexisting meaning that is not valid for that specific use. That is the position that I wrote about as a reason for complaining.
                        You’re point is irrelevant. None of that matters. It’s a game and a made up place. Maybe Luterra did a away with some gender specific titles. History means nothing here. The title existing in outside the game has no relevance.
                            Again - if you want benefits from preexisting meaning and connotations of a word - use the word as it is. If you want to ignore meaning and connotations - don't be surprised that people complain about it. It's that simple.

  
Also - I'd like to add a grammar-nazi mantra, completely unrelated to the discussion itself:  
Grammar is knowing the difference between knowing your shit and knowing  you're shit.
                You're right! But as you also stated this wasn't the point being made. Nice catch tho, that completely went over my head!
                    Fair enough; I must admit the part where he wanted a sword and armor was a thing I did miss.
        No need to get so defensive, damn
 Not all knights carry swords or even armour ..
    Shut up Meg
         Go home dad ye drunk....
Technically it's a fancy title for a Noble rank, a seemingly very important rank given there's apparently only been a few and we are the most famous one.
Yeah. That gave me a good chuckle since I just assume my Bard is constantly walking around singing songs by Kansas. And now I am more knightly than all these mother fuckers in giant platemail armor.
Imagine when artist comes out and luterra’s knight is a brush wielding loli
Dame doesn't really convey the martial spirit.
You bet!
Getting Final Fantasy vibes from this game.

Mostly everyone uses magic, but Arthetine is the Empire and they have g u n s

7:21 scouter class
    Boost saved
        might be saving it for quite a while
            Apparently it was translated wrong, so we may be getting all missing classes at once.
                That would be absolutely rad but I honestly kind of doubt it. Maybe at a faster pace than the original release but every new class draws a lot of players back.

I don't know if it would make sense to fire everything at once when they have a very straightforward way to catch the attention of players back.
                    Yeah, I'm all for it if it happens but not expecting it. Really want Artist.
                        Forget gundam, we need Okami
                        I'm looking forward to lancer
                    But do we want any new players back considering that EU literally can't open the game and queue up due to heavy traffic every day after 2pm ?
                        Got a job doing 2-9 pm shifts. Go to bed early and wake up to playing lost ark queue free.

Morning players are friendly and chill too.
                        Steam app on your phone, pop it up during work and start the queue.
                I am korean and watched the director interview. It was vague. They are coming in 3 months but he never said ‘at once’.
                    Guess we'll see in a couple months what that meant then ahah thank you
                    While you're here, can you please catch me up on the Golden River thing? That's... an *unusual* name for much of English speaking cultures, for... *reasons.*
                        It’s direct transition. Geum Gang Sun. Is his name. Geum direct translation into gold. And Gang is river. Sun is not translated. His name really doesn’t mean that tho probably. 

In Korea, when we name our children, it’s usually done with meaning in each character. Not always tho.
                            Thanks! I really appreciate that.
                            Would you show me a phonetic pronunciation of his Korean name?
                        golden river doesn't meant anything.
you are thinking of golden shower
                            Glad I don't know the actual term.
                [deleted]

                        [deleted]
                            2-3 months iirc
                    No it wasn't translated wrong. I've listened to it few times to check and he mentioned 2-3 months as time frame for new updates but never said all the classes will come at once.   


Source: I'm Korean
            Haven't SmileGate said that they want to push out content somewhat rapidly so that's they don't have to manage several different versions of the game?
                Thats amazing for them and for us
                I’m def a proponent of pushing for reaching patch parity between Regions as swiftly as possible. The periodic patch envy as a Monster Hunter World PC player felt like always being fat kid last picked in a Sports pug draft.
                    Yeah, I much prefer things to be synchronized internationally and across all platforms when possible. It's frustrating to see other people playing content we don't have access to yet.
                I heard roadmap is every two months and others are saying 2-3 months. Could be accurate.
                No idea, but I've never seen a Korean MMO that wasn't months behind on content in NA/EU.
            If the info about mistranslation was correct, we are getting ALL of the missing classes in 2-3 months. Not that long (:
                I thought it said they would be releasing them *every* two months meaning it would be more than one release. Which makes sense because it is more opportunities to sell class packs without burning everyone out making them buy all the packs at once. (Or pissing off people because they can't afford that.)
        I heard that on the Korean servers players were given a powerpass when the new classes got released. Might be the same on western servers.
            Sometimes they did. It was not universal. I *think* they have made that SOP now, but there is the possibility still they won't.
        Just use knowledge transfer and boost something else to play for the next ~3 months
        lol, yep. I'm currently saving one for scouter
    I want to play bigass hammerbro!
        lol, yea that guy is nuts. RU was filled with them.
    You know in hindsight the old names were retarded.
    When does that come out??
    That is amazing looking. But as someone who's only level 14 I hope the lore at least somewhat explains the really confusing mix of simple medieval towns and really hi tech shit at some point.
        Narrator: It doesn't.

This is pretty common in Korean MMOs. Look at Maple Story, when the game first came out you had Warriors, Archers and Mages starting in very much fantasy towns. The mages started in a magical tree, the archers started in a medieval mushroom looking town, and the warriors started out in the mountains as a sort of tribe.

Then you had the Thief class, that started in straight up Chicago, cabs and all.
            I thought it was detroit
            I mean MapleStory literally made a spin off that's just set on modern day Earth
        basically the gunners are unable to use magic
they are in fact a different race of human called cykin which are part machine
        I would assume an easy thing would be that while some people are intrinsically born with special abilities they're suited for, regular people who want to fight would have to develop technologically(Like we do IRL). and it seems the technology has reached the level where it can even help people who DO have crazy abilities.
    Damn, why do they release those later? Laser guy looks interesting but ill still use my slinger.
[deleted]
    Scouter…
I have only played on NA but Scouter is the class I cant wait for, hoping it's one of the first classes released to NA in 3 months.
The Artillerist.
>gunlancer

Why would a **gun**lancer be confused about the technology?
    He's generally confused ;-)
    My berserker is too angry to care.
    Dunno, spending most of the time getting hit in the face by your average house-sized demon might do that to a guy.
    I mean, there's not a lot of technology behind the Gunlance... It's just a Pointy Stick that can go boom
        It's a gun that's also a lance (or a lance that's also a gun), what more is there to explain?
I cant help but feel like the game director got inspired by all the wildly different islands in One Piece, considering his gaming nickname is literally inspired by the most renown pirate in that anime.

The main characters in One Piece also travel from island to island and they are just as wild as they are in Lost Ark. I really recommend watching it if you havent seen it yet, it's one of the best pieces of modern entertainment that I've ever seen in my life, up there with Lord of the Rings, for example.
    That's a great observation. This game combined traditional sword-and-sorcery with One Piece exploration.
    I didnt think of one piece but u right. Feels like the game combined many cultural hits like one piece and lord of the rings. But the directors name I believe is a direct translation. Geum means gold and Gang means river in korean.
        Yeah, and that's what I mean. I remember in one of the interviews he clarified that his gaming name is actually "Gol D. River" which is a very clear reference to One Piece if you've seen at least the very first episode.

And if you haven't, to save you the few minutes, the most notorious pirate in the anime who also started the Great Pirate Era was called "Gol D. Roger", but they shorten his name to Gold Roger.

Gold River is a literal reference to that.
            I named my island Raftel lol. What a coincidence.
        Arthetine is clearly inspired from FF7 for instance.
            Several of the bosses are League references as well, spotted Rengar and Ahri atleast so far.
                Nine-tailed foxes are pretty prevalent in Asian media. Doubt it's a league reference lmao
                Also I feel the whole of Soulfist is a dragonball reference
                I remember the Ahri reference from the Anikka tournament, but where have you seen Rengar?

Genuinely curious as I'm a Rengar/Katarina/Diana OTP in League so I'd like to know if I missed him or just haven't reached that far yet. :D
                    The last boss in [this](https://youtu.be/mNkoCT3jz4o?t=421) place gave me some heavy Rengar vibes and apparently so did for the guy who made the video :D
                        Omfg yea, now that I look at the boss, he does look and fight like Rengar, wtf.

I totally didn't realize it during my initial playthrough cuz I was kinda rushing. xD Thanks for the vid, I appreciate it.
                    Its in the ruins, an early game dungeon in west luterra I believe.
    Also Ragnarok Online is heavy inspiration for Lost Ark and that's showing. 

Deadeye is basically Gunslinger from RO and Einbroch shows everywhere in Arthetine.

Koreans have a thing for Pseudo Nordic mythology as well.
        Don’t forget king’s avatar
That’s called having no identity. Korean companies struggle with that. Smilegate even threw Warhammer 40k marines in. Same with Hyundai - Korean car manufacturer. When you look at a Hyundai car, you don’t see a Hyundai. You see bits and pieces of BMW, Toyota, Jaguar, Mercedes, Ford. 

I’m not quite sure why gamers think that incoherent mess of hundreds of ideas is good.

If they were isolated to islands - good. But they are in main continents.
    Having a world with many different settings can be interesting, and there's many different ways to have a good world. Final fantasy has always had high tech mixed in, and it's a Japanese game. I'm not quite sure you are able to express the opinions of hundreds of millions of different gamers what they are allowed to think is good or not.
        I am able. Look at gamer PCs, look at workstations from Apple or even Dell. Tasteless man-children.
            The irony in this post hahaha.
                The lack of introspection of your own culture haha.
Every continent felt like a separate single player campaign to me
John wick goes for efficiency.

[Gun kata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U02E2sjwlLM) goes for style.
We need something similar for Berserker. I love those huge swords but I made more of viking looking character and would love to have huge battleaxe!
    yeah ngl
i mean, i prefer swords, but some of these already look like some weird axe thing with how huge they are at the end of the blade. might as well reskin them to axes
    There were 2 Axe skins for Berserker on RU server if I remember correctly. They were a bit more punkish with spikes and saws here and there, but there was definitely an axe head at the top which made it look super rad. Imagine your sword but with axe head at the top.

I am personally waiting for my Lancemaster to come out and buy another red Scythe :)
That skin for the gunslinger also puts small hatchet bayonet style on her shotgun and rifle
Isn't Arcana the Sorc? Soul Fist cast spells with her fist.
    No, arcana is a card based caster not in NA/EU yet
        Like Twisted Fate?
            Haha kinda. Lots of memes when I played in RU called it the Yugioh class.
            More like Astrologian from FFXIV
    No there is a twisted fate league of legends class. It  applies card counters to enemies and then has abilities that consume them for extra damage. Kind of like a mage rogue with assassinate stacks.
Artist? 

So some people get to throw fireballs out of their hands and your power is you got a liberal arts degree?
    It’s actually more like an Epic Mickey or Okami kind of thing.
We need class switch option then. Is there any in Korea?
Artist is a specialist, not a mage.
I just checked some unreleased classes and apparently the one that is missing is the actual class that plays like Rogue/Assassin, I hope they release everything soon.
    yessir
I don't mind the gun classes but I wish they had a shaman, warlock or nercomancer, maybe even druid would be nice.
    Agreed.

Then the necromancer could be added to the bottom of that photo montage saying: "and your dead brother"  =)
LMAO I play fantasy games because I'm so fucking tired of how boring guns are and how prevalent they are in EVERYTHING in the US. FPS games drain the life out of me with every bullet
The mining trainer looks like a dwarf straight outa Warhammer.
or the artillerist.... \^^
It's so dumb dude, do they not realise they're fucking up momentum. It makes more sense to do it in the other direction, towards your team.
    Dunno, man. I am playing everything solo so far. I had my partner help me with one boss, other than that... I am so not in the mood to deal with gamer community in general. But it would piss me off, the Mk12 takes time to shoot.
The air strike T3 tripod that turns it into one singular nuke may be my favorite.
    Same , dude are out there with sword and board I’m calling in orbital strikes it’s hilarious.
        Lol spellcasters moving in protected by Paladins, meanwhile Artillerist coordinating B52s
    I must be the only Artillerist main who uses the multi-hit on Air Raid. I like the CC triggers more than the flat damage.
        Honestly I was just following a leveling guide, but may try out some different stuff closer to 50. That sounds good too
            It shines in Dungeons as far as I've seen. Being able to chain stagger large groups of enemies while harder hitting DPS classes can safely and accurately light them up is super satisfying.
                probably my favorite part of the game is how these choices are actually viable, i love all the skill customization available
    What about the homing missle that straight up nukes enemies
I had a chuckle on that fight because I didn't use the gourd. Just kept blasting everything once I noticed you still do damage even when he's invisible. He still whines like you used it.
Me as a Sorc to him: *that* is what you are taking issue with?
One of my favorite Deadeye skills
Fine, fine! 
**straps explosions to a stick** it's a Lance. It does poke poke smash lance-stuff, ^and ^^also ^^goes ^^^boom, OK?? 

I have to admit though, my favorite part of the Luterra Wall scene was gunlance's howl. Literally jumped into the courtyard, backhopped backwards into the giant mob, and got told off by a guard to stop all that... shouting. 

Something about making people nervous or whatever..
    Ye Olde Wild West, home of the Gunlance Jousting.
I'm mostly puzzled as to why Luterra is basically pre-industrial era while Arthetine is well, Arthetine.

Yeah yeah you are very smart and all, got it. You and the dozen other people who said the exact same thing that is. So, here, I give you the title of smarty-pants, be proud.

Still, I find it funny to name a magus "knight", in the context of a medieval kingdom of knights, with a knight king in sword and armor, alongside his army of knights with swords and armors.
    Ah yes..very odd that a king would 'Knight' his most loyal servant and protector. I get that it feels out of tune, but don't start getting angry with me when you make something weird that obviously isn't. Also why are you giving me the title of smarty-pants while I'm not wearing pants, huh?! We cool bro dont be so angry towards internet strangers we're not worth it
        if you bothered to check before explaining you would've known that 'Knight' is an INCORRECT title for Female. While granting knighthood is a term for both men and women, the correct terms would be 'Knight' for male and 'Dame' for female. And yes - it was possible for a woman to get 'knighted' \[i.e. to be granted knighthood'\], though the term used would've been 'Dame'. If we want to be exact then we should've used term 'damehood' and 'granted damehood', though I did use the incorrect term to show connection between the two versions of the same title.

In fact - this is the title used currently in the UK, for example by Dame Judi Dench and Dame Maggie Smith, 

So yes - complaining about being 'Knight' when female IS valid issue. Just not due to your perceived problem with 'I dun' use typical knight gear', but it is an issue about using correct title.
            > complaining about being 'Knight' when female IS valid issue.

Sure if this was the UK. But it's not. It's Luterra. So unless there is something in the games lore that says knighted women are "Dames", you are just projecting UK customs onto a completely different kingdom which may have completely different rules and customs.
                I used current UK to show title as is being used now and happens to be direct 1:1 conversion of 'knight' title historically.

Also - historically - many countries that did in fact recognize women in that rank would include their specific words for the title itself when granted to women. 

Examples include: 

Дама  
Витез  
Dam  
Bruņiniece  
Ντάμα

&#x200B;

It MIGHT have something to do that unlike in English - in Majority of languages in Europe there is such a thing as grammatical gender. Ironically - one of two that were prominent languages in Europe back in the medieval times \[Irish, English\] that do not - still have such distinction \[Knight/Dame as mentioned before\].

Yes - it is Luterra - devs have the right to chose any word they want. Why then choose a knight, that has historic connotations and is customary title for minor nobility in Europe, with regional versions? The answer? BECAUSE it has those connotations and cultural meaning that has been ingrained in popular subconsciousness. 

Hell, why not add a rank of 'knight' as a reward in tournament in different fantasy area? Because it simply would not 'fit' the theme of that area. Why? See above.

No - I am NOT projecting 'UK customs' - I am writing regarding historic context that the word was used, and here's the deal - STILL IS in reality. And fun fact - there is no monarchy that grants title of that rank that does not have that distinction to my knowledge. 

UK is country with monarchy that is most active when it comes to titles and nobility \[which might be because of having quite a few countries under their belt as the 'commonwealth'\]? Ooooh noooo. How dare they.

&#x200B;

Point stays - if you want to use existing word - keep with its' meaning.

If you want to use a word as you want - make sure the word does not have preexisting meaning that is not valid for that specific use. That is the position that I wrote about as a reason for complaining.
                    You’re point is irrelevant. None of that matters. It’s a game and a made up place. Maybe Luterra did a away with some gender specific titles. History means nothing here. The title existing in outside the game has no relevance.
                        Again - if you want benefits from preexisting meaning and connotations of a word - use the word as it is. If you want to ignore meaning and connotations - don't be surprised that people complain about it. It's that simple.

  
Also - I'd like to add a grammar-nazi mantra, completely unrelated to the discussion itself:  
Grammar is knowing the difference between knowing your shit and knowing  you're shit.
            You're right! But as you also stated this wasn't the point being made. Nice catch tho, that completely went over my head!
                Fair enough; I must admit the part where he wanted a sword and armor was a thing I did miss.
    No need to get so defensive, damn
Shut up Meg
     Go home dad ye drunk....
Boost saved
    might be saving it for quite a while
        Apparently it was translated wrong, so we may be getting all missing classes at once.
            That would be absolutely rad but I honestly kind of doubt it. Maybe at a faster pace than the original release but every new class draws a lot of players back.

I don't know if it would make sense to fire everything at once when they have a very straightforward way to catch the attention of players back.
                Yeah, I'm all for it if it happens but not expecting it. Really want Artist.
                    Forget gundam, we need Okami
                    I'm looking forward to lancer
                But do we want any new players back considering that EU literally can't open the game and queue up due to heavy traffic every day after 2pm ?
                    Got a job doing 2-9 pm shifts. Go to bed early and wake up to playing lost ark queue free.

Morning players are friendly and chill too.
                    Steam app on your phone, pop it up during work and start the queue.
            I am korean and watched the director interview. It was vague. They are coming in 3 months but he never said ‘at once’.
                Guess we'll see in a couple months what that meant then ahah thank you
                While you're here, can you please catch me up on the Golden River thing? That's... an *unusual* name for much of English speaking cultures, for... *reasons.*
                    It’s direct transition. Geum Gang Sun. Is his name. Geum direct translation into gold. And Gang is river. Sun is not translated. His name really doesn’t mean that tho probably. 

In Korea, when we name our children, it’s usually done with meaning in each character. Not always tho.
                        Thanks! I really appreciate that.
                        Would you show me a phonetic pronunciation of his Korean name?
                    golden river doesn't meant anything.

                Yeah, I much prefer things to be synchronized internationally and across all platforms when possible. It's frustrating to see other people playing content we don't have access to yet.
            I heard roadmap is every two months and others are saying 2-3 months. Could be accurate.
            No idea, but I've never seen a Korean MMO that wasn't months behind on content in NA/EU.
        If the info about mistranslation was correct, we are getting ALL of the missing classes in 2-3 months. Not that long (:
            I thought it said they would be releasing them *every* two months meaning it would be more than one release. Which makes sense because it is more opportunities to sell class packs without burning everyone out making them buy all the packs at once. (Or pissing off people because they can't afford that.)
    I heard that on the Korean servers players were given a powerpass when the new classes got released. Might be the same on western servers.
        Sometimes they did. It was not universal. I *think* they have made that SOP now, but there is the possibility still they won't.
    Just use knowledge transfer and boost something else to play for the next ~3 months
    lol, yep. I'm currently saving one for scouter
I want to play bigass hammerbro!
    lol, yea that guy is nuts. RU was filled with them.
You know in hindsight the old names were retarded.
When does that come out??
That is amazing looking. But as someone who's only level 14 I hope the lore at least somewhat explains the really confusing mix of simple medieval towns and really hi tech shit at some point.
    Narrator: It doesn't.

This is pretty common in Korean MMOs. Look at Maple Story, when the game first came out you had Warriors, Archers and Mages starting in very much fantasy towns. The mages started in a magical tree, the archers started in a medieval mushroom looking town, and the warriors started out in the mountains as a sort of tribe.

Then you had the Thief class, that started in straight up Chicago, cabs and all.
        I thought it was detroit
        I mean MapleStory literally made a spin off that's just set on modern day Earth
    basically the gunners are unable to use magic
they are in fact a different race of human called cykin which are part machine
    I would assume an easy thing would be that while some people are intrinsically born with special abilities they're suited for, regular people who want to fight would have to develop technologically(Like we do IRL). and it seems the technology has reached the level where it can even help people who DO have crazy abilities.
Damn, why do they release those later? Laser guy looks interesting but ill still use my slinger.
Scouter…
He's generally confused ;-)
My berserker is too angry to care.
Dunno, spending most of the time getting hit in the face by your average house-sized demon might do that to a guy.
I mean, there's not a lot of technology behind the Gunlance... It's just a Pointy Stick that can go boom
    It's a gun that's also a lance (or a lance that's also a gun), what more is there to explain?
That's a great observation. This game combined traditional sword-and-sorcery with One Piece exploration.
I didnt think of one piece but u right. Feels like the game combined many cultural hits like one piece and lord of the rings. But the directors name I believe is a direct translation. Geum means gold and Gang means river in korean.
    Yeah, and that's what I mean. I remember in one of the interviews he clarified that his gaming name is actually "Gol D. River" which is a very clear reference to One Piece if you've seen at least the very first episode.

And if you haven't, to save you the few minutes, the most notorious pirate in the anime who also started the Great Pirate Era was called "Gol D. Roger", but they shorten his name to Gold Roger.

Gold River is a literal reference to that.
        I named my island Raftel lol. What a coincidence.
    Arthetine is clearly inspired from FF7 for instance.
        Several of the bosses are League references as well, spotted Rengar and Ahri atleast so far.
            Nine-tailed foxes are pretty prevalent in Asian media. Doubt it's a league reference lmao
            Also I feel the whole of Soulfist is a dragonball reference
            I remember the Ahri reference from the Anikka tournament, but where have you seen Rengar?

Genuinely curious as I'm a Rengar/Katarina/Diana OTP in League so I'd like to know if I missed him or just haven't reached that far yet. :D
                The last boss in [this](https://youtu.be/mNkoCT3jz4o?t=421) place gave me some heavy Rengar vibes and apparently so did for the guy who made the video :D
                    Omfg yea, now that I look at the boss, he does look and fight like Rengar, wtf.

I totally didn't realize it during my initial playthrough cuz I was kinda rushing. xD Thanks for the vid, I appreciate it.
                Its in the ruins, an early game dungeon in west luterra I believe.
Also Ragnarok Online is heavy inspiration for Lost Ark and that's showing. 

Deadeye is basically Gunslinger from RO and Einbroch shows everywhere in Arthetine.

Koreans have a thing for Pseudo Nordic mythology as well.
    Don’t forget king’s avatar
Having a world with many different settings can be interesting, and there's many different ways to have a good world. Final fantasy has always had high tech mixed in, and it's a Japanese game. I'm not quite sure you are able to express the opinions of hundreds of millions of different gamers what they are allowed to think is good or not.
    I am able. Look at gamer PCs, look at workstations from Apple or even Dell. Tasteless man-children.
        The irony in this post hahaha.
            The lack of introspection of your own culture haha.

Which makes sense because it is more opportunities to sell class packs without burning everyone out making them buy all the packs at once. (Or pissing off people because they can't afford that.)
I heard that on the Korean servers players were given a powerpass when the new classes got released. Might be the same on western servers.
    Sometimes they did. It was not universal. I *think* they have made that SOP now, but there is the possibility still they won't.
Just use knowledge transfer and boost something else to play for the next ~3 months
lol, yep. I'm currently saving one for scouter
lol, yea that guy is nuts. RU was filled with them.
Narrator: It doesn't.

This is pretty common in Korean MMOs. Look at Maple Story, when the game first came out you had Warriors, Archers and Mages starting in very much fantasy towns. The mages started in a magical tree, the archers started in a medieval mushroom looking town, and the warriors started out in the mountains as a sort of tribe.

Then you had the Thief class, that started in straight up Chicago, cabs and all.
    I thought it was detroit
    I mean MapleStory literally made a spin off that's just set on modern day Earth
basically the gunners are unable to use magic
they are in fact a different race of human called cykin which are part machine
I would assume an easy thing would be that while some people are intrinsically born with special abilities they're suited for, regular people who want to fight would have to develop technologically(Like we do IRL). and it seems the technology has reached the level where it can even help people who DO have crazy abilities.
It's a gun that's also a lance (or a lance that's also a gun), what more is there to explain?
Yeah, and that's what I mean. I remember in one of the interviews he clarified that his gaming name is actually "Gol D. River" which is a very clear reference to One Piece if you've seen at least the very first episode.

And if you haven't, to save you the few minutes, the most notorious pirate in the anime who also started the Great Pirate Era was called "Gol D. Roger", but they shorten his name to Gold Roger.

Gold River is a literal reference to that.
    I named my island Raftel lol. What a coincidence.
Arthetine is clearly inspired from FF7 for instance.
    Several of the bosses are League references as well, spotted Rengar and Ahri atleast so far.
        Nine-tailed foxes are pretty prevalent in Asian media. Doubt it's a league reference lmao
        Also I feel the whole of Soulfist is a dragonball reference
        I remember the Ahri reference from the Anikka tournament, but where have you seen Rengar?

Genuinely curious as I'm a Rengar/Katarina/Diana OTP in League so I'd like to know if I missed him or just haven't reached that far yet. :D
            The last boss in [this](https://youtu.be/mNkoCT3jz4o?t=421) place gave me some heavy Rengar vibes and apparently so did for the guy who made the video :D
                Omfg yea, now that I look at the boss, he does look and fight like Rengar, wtf.

I totally didn't realize it during my initial playthrough cuz I was kinda rushing. xD Thanks for the vid, I appreciate it.
            Its in the ruins, an early game dungeon in west luterra I believe.
Don’t forget king’s avatar
I am able. Look at gamer PCs, look at workstations from Apple or even Dell. Tasteless man-children.
    The irony in this post hahaha.
        The lack of introspection of your own culture haha.
Like Twisted Fate?
    Haha kinda. Lots of memes when I played in RU called it the Yugioh class.
    More like Astrologian from FFXIV
Lol spellcasters moving in protected by Paladins, meanwhile Artillerist coordinating B52s
Honestly I was just following a leveling guide, but may try out some different stuff closer to 50. That sounds good too
    It shines in Dungeons as far as I've seen. Being able to chain stagger large groups of enemies while harder hitting DPS classes can safely and accurately light them up is super satisfying.
        probably my favorite part of the game is how these choices are actually viable, i love all the skill customization available
if you bothered to check before explaining you would've known that 'Knight' is an INCORRECT title for Female. While granting knighthood is a term for both men and women, the correct terms would be 'Knight' for male and 'Dame' for female. And yes - it was possible for a woman to get 'knighted' \[i.e. to be granted knighthood'\], though the term used would've been 'Dame'. If we want to be exact then we should've used term 'damehood' and 'granted damehood', though I did use the incorrect term to show connection between the two versions of the same title.

In fact - this is the title used currently in the UK, for example by Dame Judi Dench and Dame Maggie Smith, 

So yes - complaining about being 'Knight' when female IS valid issue. Just not due to your perceived problem with 'I dun' use typical knight gear', but it is an issue about using correct title.
    > complaining about being 'Knight' when female IS valid issue.

Sure if this was the UK. But it's not. It's Luterra. So unless there is something in the games lore that says knighted women are "Dames", you are just projecting UK customs onto a completely different kingdom which may have completely different rules and customs.
        I used current UK to show title as is being used now and happens to be direct 1:1 conversion of 'knight' title historically.

Also - historically - many countries that did in fact recognize women in that rank would include their specific words for the title itself when granted to women. 

Examples include: 

Дама  
Витез  
Dam  
Bruņiniece  
Ντάμα

&#x200B;

It MIGHT have something to do that unlike in English - in Majority of languages in Europe there is such a thing as grammatical gender. Ironically - one of two that were prominent languages in Europe back in the medieval times \[Irish, English\] that do not - still have such distinction \[Knight/Dame as mentioned before\].

Yes - it is Luterra - devs have the right to chose any word they want. Why then choose a knight, that has historic connotations and is customary title for minor nobility in Europe, with regional versions? The answer? BECAUSE it has those connotations and cultural meaning that has been ingrained in popular subconsciousness. 

Hell, why not add a rank of 'knight' as a reward in tournament in different fantasy area? Because it simply would not 'fit' the theme of that area. Why? See above.

No - I am NOT projecting 'UK customs' - I am writing regarding historic context that the word was used, and here's the deal - STILL IS in reality. And fun fact - there is no monarchy that grants title of that rank that does not have that distinction to my knowledge. 

UK is country with monarchy that is most active when it comes to titles and nobility \[which might be because of having quite a few countries under their belt as the 'commonwealth'\]? Ooooh noooo. How dare they.

&#x200B;

Point stays - if you want to use existing word - keep with its' meaning.

If you want to use a word as you want - make sure the word does not have preexisting meaning that is not valid for that specific use. That is the position that I wrote about as a reason for complaining.
            You’re point is irrelevant. None of that matters. It’s a game and a made up place. Maybe Luterra did a away with some gender specific titles. History means nothing here. The title existing in outside the game has no relevance.
                Again - if you want benefits from preexisting meaning and connotations of a word - use the word as it is. If you want to ignore meaning and connotations - don't be surprised that people complain about it. It's that simple.

  
Also - I'd like to add a grammar-nazi mantra, completely unrelated to the discussion itself:  
Grammar is knowing the difference between knowing your shit and knowing  you're shit.
    You're right! But as you also stated this wasn't the point being made. Nice catch tho, that completely went over my head!
        Fair enough; I must admit the part where he wanted a sword and armor was a thing I did miss.
Apparently it was translated wrong, so we may be getting all missing classes at once.
    That would be absolutely rad but I honestly kind of doubt it. Maybe at a faster pace than the original release but every new class draws a lot of players back.

I don't know if it would make sense to fire everything at once when they have a very straightforward way to catch the attention of players back.
        Yeah, I'm all for it if it happens but not expecting it. Really want Artist.
            Forget gundam, we need Okami
            I'm looking forward to lancer
        But do we want any new players back considering that EU literally can't open the game and queue up due to heavy traffic every day after 2pm ?
            Got a job doing 2-9 pm shifts. Go to bed early and wake up to playing lost ark queue free.

Morning players are friendly and chill too.
            Steam app on your phone, pop it up during work and start the queue.
    I am korean and watched the director interview. It was vague. They are coming in 3 months but he never said ‘at once’.
        Guess we'll see in a couple months what that meant then ahah thank you
        While you're here, can you please catch me up on the Golden River thing? That's... an *unusual* name for much of English speaking cultures, for... *reasons.*
            It’s direct transition. Geum Gang Sun. Is his name. Geum direct translation into gold. And Gang is river. Sun is not translated. His name really doesn’t mean that tho probably. 

In Korea, when we name our children, it’s usually done with meaning in each character. Not always tho.
                Thanks! I really appreciate that.
                Would you show me a phonetic pronunciation of his Korean name?
            golden river doesn't meant anything.
you are thinking of golden shower
                Glad I don't know the actual term.

Haven't SmileGate said that they want to push out content somewhat rapidly so that's they don't have to manage several different versions of the game?
    Thats amazing for them and for us
    I’m def a proponent of pushing for reaching patch parity between Regions as swiftly as possible. The periodic patch envy as a Monster Hunter World PC player felt like always being fat kid last picked in a Sports pug draft.
        Yeah, I much prefer things to be synchronized internationally and across all platforms when possible. It's frustrating to see other people playing content we don't have access to yet.
    I heard roadmap is every two months and others are saying 2-3 months. Could be accurate.
    No idea, but I've never seen a Korean MMO that wasn't months behind on content in NA/EU.
