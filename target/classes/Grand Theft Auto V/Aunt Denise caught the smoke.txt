        We all know she doesn't really live there. Dave Chapelle skit reference. "\*gasp\* "He's still here!" \*hits him with club\* "Open and shut case Johnson." "I saw this once when I was a rookie, apparently this nword broke in here and hung up pictures of his family." "Well lets sprinkle some crack on him and get out of here."
    She has a brain?
There is some charm in GTA 5’s physics.
    Gotta love the Euphoria engine. Custom made masterpiece lol. No other game can touch GTA and Red Dead
        Gotta love having multiple gta games letting you actually crouch. But one doesn’t for some reason.
            Which one doesn’t let you crouch? One of the ones before SA?
                Is……it’s this a joke.
                    The one we're looking at, Dick! You can't crouch in GTA5
                        I have put a lot of hours in GTA5. I would have sworn on my very life that you could crouch in that game. I am astounded.
                            You can crouch behind short walls and cars that’s about it.
                    It is not. I haven’t played the ones before SA since I was a kid so I don’t really remember if you could crouch.

    Ummm akshly gta four is bettah 🤓☝️
        "drunk driving is way more fun in 4 that's why I don't even play 5, won't be playing 6 unless they make drunk driving fun again"
            Tbh it should be at LEAST as fun as it is in real life
                Fun? That shit is nerve-wracking
                    If you're bad at it yea
                        You shouldn't be doing it at all, dummy.
                            I don't 



;)
                            Then how would he know if it's fun?
                    Skill issue 

^(fr tho sitting next to a drunk driver is terrifying af)
                    The trick is to drive as fast as possible so you spend the least amount of time drunk driving
            That's responsible advice 😌👌
            if that person cares about drunk driving so much they should do it in real life
            Agrreed
        and its more realistic bcuz um u can pick up a brick 🤓🤓🤓
            Lol it's better, cry about it.
                Sorry old man didnt mean to upset you
    r/gtaiv has been called
Did she tell you to pay her hospital bills?
We are women we are freeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
    Shaaaaauuuuut up!
        Thank you…
            Oh my n word, wassup homie!
                *[Trevor_trip.Webb.]*
For a second, I thought she was wearing clown makeup.
    She doesn't have to
Why you shooting the cop in the nuts?
    you don’t shoot a guy in the dick butters
        😂😂😂😂😂
        🤣🤣🤣🤣
    Is there a lore reason? Is he stupid?
        he should be thrown into the aslume with jonkler and bone
Aaaaahh yeessss, finally someone kill her. Thanks god.
This was oddly realistic
Is it just me or is the way she got shot kinda Horrifiying with the physics.

At least, it would be if it wasn’t Auntie D anyway
    That's Euphoria physics.

            Nice. Perfect complimenting. 👍"You complete..me" ~ Joker 🃏
    It's pretty realistic is why it's horrifying.  Any instantly fatal trauma does that. Your body drops like a puppet with its strings cut.
Oh no! Anyway...
What happens after this? Does she call you from the hospital complaining, or is it like Vice City, where she just respawns later on as if nothing had happened.
    She just respawned, probably not meant to be able to kill her like the other npcs
        Neat, sometimes when you hurt important NPCs yourself, they will call later from the hospital complaining. Once, a buddy shot Lance Vance in Vice City in the head, and he just appeared on a cutscene right afterward. You could see his headless duplicated body on the floor of I remember correctly.
    They send an angry text and you have to pay a 1000$ hospital bill
holy crap! does she call you later to get her from the hospital or anything?
    She respawns, no phone call
        Aww. That could have been a nice touch
This is built like a whole gore video.
Hi I’m Johnny Knoxville and welcome to jackass
Damn the way she plopped over was realistic as hell wtf
And nothing value was lost
Anyways I started blasting
That was so satisfying
Bro I never seen so one kill her
She didn’t even see it coming 🤣
I laughed way too hard at this 🤣
I forget exactly how realistic gta is sometimes lol
Bro aimed perfectly for a headshot
Bitch should’ve been a better bullet ducker.
I’ll never forget when I ran her over with a motorcycle in the house and burned her body. ❤️
Dammnnn, that’s a live leak video right there
What mission is this? Or did you just lure the cops inside during free roam?
    pretty sure its free roam, i dont think the house is accessible in any mission
SCREW YOU ALL!
Give the cop a medal for icing that bitch 🤣
oh damn. i didn't even think this was possible
She didn’t even see it coming 🤣
The cop just saw black
Jesus Christ this games sound design is trash. The guns literally sound like pew pew
Damn
Damn clear HS
Say. Her. Name. #BT
Bitch should’ve been a better bullet ducker.
Let’s go I’m sick of her!
Such an accurate depiction of American cops
Average American police officer.
lol
What do mean she can crack a walnut using her vagina
What cops do
Lore accurate American cops
🐷
Jesus put a NSFW tag at least.
    No
        Damn it.
does that mean Franklin gets both apartments now?
Boom headshoot
What version are you playing cuz it never looked like this when I played !
    Xbox Series X version
Thats aunt viv from fresh prince of bel air
Damn that cop said "Taking one of you with me"
Aunt Denise, more like Aunt Demise
I love these random moments where the Euphoria engine just makes a realistic ragdoll death.
Fresh Prince Vivian
And while putting that mask on too
![gif](giphy|CnquLPvQe88nEsHiKm)
They shot her in the back of the head haha
She was coming right at him with a knife, you saw it.
Damn, this game be to accurate sometimes. He fell out and shot her by mistake. Great programming.
Something similar happened a real life a few years ago…
Holy shit haha
I guess an acorn must have fallen....
Oh shit lmao
Omg
All too real
Normal day in America
GYOOOOOD
Why does it look like she's caught in one of her BDSM session?

&#x200B;

Oh, it's an exfoliating mask, lol.

&#x200B;

Thank god I didn't say that out loud among people in real life.   It's probably time to log off.
I love how at the end another cop just leans in there lmao
This is honestly unsettling
Never liked that biatch.
Finally.
