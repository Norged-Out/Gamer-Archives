GTA V: The Definitive Edition
    Defective Edition
    Yo take my fucking award and gtfo
    Diarrhea edition
    lmaoooooooo okay hear me out i dont have an award but you sure deserve one rn
        I gotchu
Is this grove street games version?
    I highly doubt Grove Street Games could pull something like this off.
        Oh they could pull it off alright, but with even worse performance than the original gta v
            I sense an incoming name change in the works...

***"Forum Drive Games"***

A unique, non-cliché kinda ring to it, no?
                Excuse me while I steal that name for my game
                Interesting fact: their name isn’t related to Grove Street of GTA:SA, but comes from the fact that the studio is headquartered in the neighborhood of Grove Street, in Gainesville, Florida.

Edit: grammar
                It needs to be something related and iconic to GTA games imo. Maybe the name of that vice city strip club?
            And with missing bridges everywhere
            While somehow requiring higher pc specs that Red Dead 2 lol.
        Straight Busta Games
        They can certainly do better, as long as take two isn't whipping the 20 or so employees and forcing them to release the game in 2 months.
            I don't think the publishers demanded the games look like shitty bootleg mobile trash
                It looks like that because they had to work on porting 3 games to a completely different engine while under a strict deadline and budget. I'm honestly surprised the game doesn't look super horrendous given the circumstances. I believe it would've looked better if they had more time, or money, or employees.
                    Old comment, but I agree. ~20 people working on 3 games each of which are this huge? It's a miracle they don't look worse. I actually feel bad for them; it really is Rockstar's fault. They pretty much set up GSG as the fall guys.
            there is no excuses, they didn't even fixed their own android bugs so the "20 employee" thing is lame, hire more people it was clear that they couldnt handle a project this size
    it's the yee yee ass haircut games making it.
    I hope it is Hove Beach Games version.
    Obviously not. 

All of the ground is present. There are no massive holes into the void, or bridges missing.

They don’t even have a black dudes face on the side  of the pier…
    Naw, Bethesda.
    Pretty sure its an attempt at a GTA V mobile version, yeah.
        That would be actually cool
    It is a fan-made mod that Rockstar lawyers are most likely already working on shutting down now that this post has been made.
    How about Soulja games?
Looks like a GTA 4 mod
    GTA 4 still looks great today, overrated comment
        Stop kissing IV's ass please, i love it but its not that great.
            said like a true dumbass that never played gta IV
                Jesus Christ, you are actually stupid. Imagine calling someone a dumbass for pointing out y'all are full of some nostalgia shit. I've played plenty of IV; plot was great, missions were boring, go from A to B and kill, driving was fun, fighting was satisfying, ragdoll was amazing, car damage is cool but the game looks dated, no denying that. Y'all attacking someone over a videogame opinion and similar dumb shit is the reason why i left this sub.
                    jesus you got so mad bro calm down, there are worse things to get angry over than a conflicting video game opinion
                        Opinion ≠ insults
                            if you’re getting this angry over being called a dumbass on the internet please delete all social media apps
                                Well, if you think a solution would be to let the internet rot with toxic people like you and you think thats normal, please seek a therapist to help you out. 

FYI - not mad, just frustrated.
                    cope harder

                Gta 4 has terrible mechanics but the graphics aren't that bad.
                    Except if you read any thread in this sub you will see people proclaiming how much they miss GTA IV's mechanics.
                        The walking in particular is super clunky, and turning on all but the best cars is stiff.
                            I adored the driving in GTA 4. It was dramatic, and required skill to maneuver. GTA 5 driving is too stiff and arcadey.
                    GTA IV has superior mechanics besides shooting. The car physics were much more realistic and fun, the ragdoll physics were fun and hilarious. And the helicopter was more difficult and felt more surreal
            Not my fault you play GTA 4 with the lowest settings, only way I can think of that this mod would look equivalent
                I never compared this mod to IV. But it is your fault for bullshit assumptions, i've played IV maxed out and its nothing special, the game is a blurry mess with that depth of field bullshit (unless you turn on definition, but you lose motion blur). Good thing you could find plenty graphical mods to fix it, and my rig runs V better than IV, because the port was rubbish unfortunately.
            Piece of shit
                ?
        stop gargling IV’s balls. Yeah it’s great, but in comparasion to V, shit’s quite low-end.
            I think fortnite’s pretty bad actually
                What the actual fuck does Fortnite have to do with this? And even so, I think that looks better than IV.
                    On nintendo switch it looks terrible so no
                        IV on a potato looks pretty bad. That means absolutely nothing. IV on the max settings on a high end PC looks way worse than Fortnite on the same condition. Just, stop.
                            Well ive never played on a potato before so I wouldn’t know
                    IV has good graphics if u put them all on the highest settings and why do u care so much about the graphics the story is 50x better then gta V
                        We are talking strictly about graphics, you moron. He said these “look like a GTA 4 mod”. That’s beacuse of their fucking looks, not the game’s story.
                            I dont like being strictly
    Yeah but no kidding, the lighting/colors and the lack of anti alias make this look like GTA5 running in GTA4 engine. This was my immediate thought upon seeing the video.
    I think your memory of GTA 4 might be slightly fudged
        I think yours is, because it looks just like 4
            Only the wonky character models. Pretty sure GTA 4 looks way better.
                Correct, I re-played 4 the other month and it looked much better than this yeh the characters aren’t but the floor and environmental textures are
                GTA IV came out in 2008 -- 13 years ago. I think people have nostalgia beer goggles on when talking about the game. It was revolutionary for its time but has aged considerably compared to modern AAA titles.
                    Nah I still regularly go back and play it because gta 5 was just never fun to me, and the graphics have held up just fine for a game in 2008.
                    I literally was just doing a playthrough of IV less than 2 months ago. This looks pretty similar if not worse because of the lack of mouth movements and environment.

Michael's face looks like it's from a GTA IV character
    Don't do GTA 4 dirty like that
        It genuinely does though. Compare his face to Gerald McReary's and tell me I'm wrong.

Edit: Nvm, I should've said a GTA IV pedestrian
        I've been playing GTA IV for the last few weeks and I can confirm this looks exactly like GTA IV.
    He went from a 45 year old cringe dad to a ruggedly handsome RDR1 cattle rustler with facial paralysis. In some ways, it's an upgrade.
    WRONG GTA 4 IS THE BEST JN EVERY ASPECT GO PLAY FORNTITE KID
        no u
        Idk if this is a satire but no. Not in graphics, specifically not in graphics
Will it be able to run GTA Online?
    I don't think so
        Fuck, I was already excited to play with my low spec homies :(

Awesome project nonetheless!
            you can play GTA 5 on low end PC, just disable shadows and lower resolution
                Still lags

    gta3 had animation rigs for the mouth while gta5 is in full body and face capture
How do PCs currently on the market not run a game that’s 8 years old considering how PCs strength grows exponentially?
    in my case, i have a 4 gb ram laptop, actually my parents think gaming is waste of time (Asian parents)
        Multitasking requires lots of memory and resolution (and higher resolution needs better GPUs). Tell them you need to upgrade for other reasons and slide in a decent GPU. Get creative lol
            oh gosh, Why didn't i think of that
        I too have a 4gb ram pc with an intel platinum processor but it still runs smooth

although the fps drops if you drive too fast but no other problems
            Do you have a Surface go? Even i have Surface Go with Intel Pentium 7th gen, HD 615 and 4gbram was wondering if this thing can run on my toaster.
        Pull the engineering career card. Engineering career = Engineering Courses which often = good deal of "advanced programming". You don't need a gaming rig, you need to be able to troubleshoot advanced algorithms to hit the good marks and you can't let your performances be bogged down by *subpar* hardware. After all, the Americans are buying up 3080's in droves, you need to compete somehow.
            sadly, I dot like it, I like medical
        tbh they are right, gaming is a HUGE waste of time unless you got nothing planned for the day and everything that needed to be complete is completed
            dude I study for 12 hours a day, ai't that enough
                it definitely is more than enough time, i’d say your parents are hypocrites for deeming gaming as a waste of time but studying for 12 hours isn’t... literally mental, i’m just saying everything should be used in moderation even studying, 12 hours? jesus
    Once upon a time, a fellow had a janky computer. T'was a Windows Vista computer from 2007, with a few new parts, and primarily running Linux at that point. It struggled even in it's good days to simply play Portal.

That fellow, yearning to really *play* video games for the first time, saved up, and saved up, and saved up.

He constructed his own machine, focusing on the permanent bits like the motherboard, keeping older replaceable parts like video card, and going low on the new parts that could also be replaced later. The plan was, the PC is decent now, but has the basis to be slowly built upon into perfection when cash was about.

Eager to start this journey, a series of most unfortunate things occured.

Crypto miners

Scalpers

Chip shortages

All the parts that were once reasonably attainable now cost more than the whole rest of the PC combined, never to be afforded.

That man now plays on someone elses Xbox and lives sadly ever after.

The end.
    Because people don't have money to buy a pc. It's also obviously not for pcs on the current market, but on the market 10 years ago. I have mine for 6 years, but I'm hoping it lasts another 2 years until I get another one.
    Obviously not made for PCs currently on the market. People in third world countries don't have the luxury to afford one.
    Some PC users are probably using crummy iGPU's and have a real lack of regular RAM amounts. In other words, some are buying non-gaming PC's to basically run gaming stuff. 

That's NEVER a good idea, as games & requirements still are WAY beyond what iGPU's can do; and dev's don't always optimize the crap out of their games either.
    We are no all Americans
    Probably because too many people try to run games on their Shared or old family pc. The game is targeted towards 18+ but there is still a large demographic of younger people who rely solely on their parents money or computers
you're telling me they made a lite version for an 8year old game???  


Whos gonna be using this??
    4gb ram laptop gang
        Increase your ram and you'll play it on anything, even if it's just 6gb.
            I have 32 gb in my Ryzen 3 laptop and it doesn't run well on lowest settings
                Well, mine has 6gb ram, a fucking intel celeron j3455 and a gt 1030 ddr4. It runs fine. Actually, i almost finished rdr2 with it, only with 3 fps around wagons, just couldn't keep playing a game like it with the lowest graphics, it doesn't feel right.
                    Good call. Like you said it’s just not right to do with a game like RDR2. I was playing 5-12 FPS on Witcher 3 😭 gave up after 30 minutes lol
                    Ayo I found my people. Relatable af
                    This is where consoles come in handy
                    At least yours has dedicated graphics I'm using the Vega graphics
                maybe u need more than just RAM bro 🤣🤣 sounds like a graphics card issue or sum
                    I actually need more ram so I can run them in dual channel cause one is slower than the other I got them for free so I could not choose the frequency of them and one is like 2400mhz and the other one is 3200 mhz
                Why would a manufacturer ship a weak ass lappy with 32 gb of ram?
                    he has extended the ram
                Why are you lying i played it on core 2 quad, gt 9500gt and 4gb ram it run great on low settings
                    It doesn't run good on integrated laptop graphics
            Lol what you joking right ? Maybe it's an issue with my pc but 16gb ram i7-4790 and a 2060 super and still get below 60 frames on medium to low
                there's something wrong with your PC, i7 4790 and RTX 2060 must run GTA 5 100+ fps at 1080p if you disable few most intensive settings.
                    Pls don't make me cry, I don't have any more money.

Tbh the anti aliasing is really taxing on the GPU but besides that I get barely and performance difference if I change from high or low. It's always below 60fps - btw this is only for GTA online (in story it runs pretty smooth)
                dude i have a 2060 super with 16gb ram and a ryzen 7 2700 and i play on the high settings with minimal frame drops in 1440p....whats wrong with your computer??
                    What do you think it could be?
        >4gb ram 

This game ran on last last gen consoles with 0.5gb ram. PS3 and 360 are 14 years old and it runs on them.

Standard GTA 5 minimum PC requirements is already 4gb

I feel like with this much effort it would make more sense to do with a more newer game like Red Dear Redemption 2 rather than an 8 year old game that runs on everything already.

            People who can't afford a better PC?
            Third world
        4gb ddr3
    Low end pc gamers will use it
        Low end today would be high end in 2013 lol
    Well, believe it or not, there are still people who want to enjoy the game but cannot afford a 1500€ gaming laptop
        You don't need a $1500 computer to run gta5 lol
            My pc is $500 and it runs on almost max settings, my old $200 laptop ran gta decently too
                I have a $1000 PC that can barely run the calculator
            You do if you want to be able to run it half decently
                Game runs on PS3 dude. Its not that demanding of a game.
                I've built a pc for 500 bucks and it runs gta on low on 60 fps.
                    yeah but thats not the same as running the game on high 120fps… If im gonna buy a gaming PC, im going to get the best u can get, otherwise it literally makes absolutely no sense as u can buy a console for 400-500 and get beautiful graphics with 60fps 😂😂 Thats like playing fortnite or something on ALL low graphics i mean is it rlly enjoyable at that point??
                Not really, i have a like 400$ desktop and only thing i can't turn up is textures.
                    It's different for most of the countries. Here in India, for example, you'd have to pay nearly 1000$ for the same desktop you have. And the average income here is much less than your country. I'm sure it would be similar(or worse) in many developing countries.
        Lmao it ran on my shitty 2010 250€ PC.
            Yeah it runs on mine too, but it's laggy, missing textures and the fps is terrible
                Then your cpu or gpu is shitty. People who built their pcs with the proper parts don't have this issue.
        Dude, GTA V has a 2008 GPU for minimum requirements
        > settings, my old $200 laptop ran gta decently to

My 300$ build run gta v on smooth setting without any problem lol
    Yeah man not everyone's as rich as you
        You don't need to be rich to have a computer that runs it. It already runs on potato PCs.
            The minimum requirement is like 4 GB RAM bruh
        mate its an 8y/o game

your mum's work laptop could probably run GTA V
            8 year old game that runs on 13 year old game consoles that had 0.5gb of ram.

A smartphone could run GTA5 these days if it was made for them.
            Cmon now, no it won’t lol.
            For some reason, it doesn't work properly on my laptop anymore. Starts lagging after a while. I didn't have any performance issues with it before but now I do and I don't know why or how.
            It can run, but then I'm sacrificing half my drive space.
    Yea man call me selfish but this is a complete fuckin waste of time lmao
    If they release it on switch I’d rebuy it. 

I assume it’s to court the “rest of the world” crowds that play games on smartphones with mouse and keyboard plugged in maybe?
    A lot of people try to run it on non gaming laptops with either basic dedicated GPU or integrated ones. They don't have desktops either because of money or space reasons
    They've been milking gtav so hard for so long they finally had to start downgrading it to justify another release
This is great. Peoples expectations these days are whack. How computer technology in a couple years can be seen as outdated is mostly a cash grab and you’re buying into it. Like a game like Mafia 2 definitive edition can’t run on an older pc when it was made to run with way lower specs and looks damn near the same. Also worth mentioning Alan Wake remastered for the same reason. Why not let these re-released versions run on old hardware...
Ok rant over, the gta community is so toxic
    They (dev's and pub's) are making these so-called "new" versions around "newer" hardware - **especially for newer consoles**, since in many ways, those don't often do tons of emulation for older-gen consoles & games - and they are "remastering" them with improved textures, resolution support, newer graphics bells & whistles, etc.

The above all that I mentioned, of course, is going to spike-up the requirements...b/c they're testing the new version on newer hardware, for THIS era; and who knows if they are also implementing real support for new graphics bells & whistle features; 4K texture support; etc etc.

Also, these dev's and pub's want $$$, so that's why they re-sell them and "Remaster" them. They are basically cutting support off old versions to get you to be up-sold to those NEW versions, so you move over to the NEW versions and buy that version.

They are also doing this to see if there's possible interest in more expansions for an old-game (i.e. see what Nordic's done Amular: Re-Reckoning w/ just releasing Fatesworn DLC and Titan Quest: Anniversary w/ its NEW 3 DLC's of Atlantis, Ragnarok, Eternal Embers DLC's)  and/or if it's worth making sequels (ME: Legendary sold well, so you know there'll be a new Mass Effect game). So, given all of that...why wouldn't they do remaster/remake stuff if consumers want them & will throw $ at them?

**It's all about $$$$.**

So, that's why the old versions exists: so it can run on old hardware from back then and also likely perform very well on modern hardware. On PC, this shouldn't be much of an issue here to run old-stuff on new stuff, whether modders fix it to work on new systems or an official dev-made re-release happens. But on consoles, there would likely need to be support for emulation of old-hardware for it to work on new hardware; or dev's would just have to port the game over directly to new hardware properly.

**The new versions ain't meant for old hardware**; it's meant for the current stuff of hardware & software - even if they ain't properly updated the old game very much in many ways.

The real problems are:

1. A lot of dev's & pub's keep DELISTING the old-versions, making it only easy to get the over-priced new version for $50-70 MSRP so they can force players to be up-sold to the new version and buy the new version, only making bank only off the new version.
2. And/or they just don't bundle & package the old-versions along w/ the REMASTERS, just in case stuff goes horribly wrong (i.e. go see GTA Trilogy Definitive, as the case of a Remaster gone WRONG).
        All very valid points. I like seeing older games run on newer hardware with improvements for sure! If a re-release grows the audience and community and gives the game a sequel then that’s great too. 
It’s those last points you mentioned that really get to me about the game industry at the moment. I guess for the casual consumer they might think to buy the cheaper version of the game if there are two versions available, then realise that it’s not optimised or the best version for their hardware so they de-list the old version.
Then we have Cyberpunk 2077 that was made for high end PCs of today but also sold on hardware from 7+ years ago. (Won’t go down that rabbit hole now!)
I personally think if the game can run smoothly,   even if it doesn’t look the best, then it’s playable on older hardware. In saying that, I think the consumer should be made aware of that though and that if they want the ‘best’ experience then buy better hardware. That way the game companies can maximise their profit without compromising their integrity.
            You have a point about the consumer buying the old-version and then realizing it ain't optimized, they need to mod it to get it working (if on PC), etc etc - so they (consumers) might just opt for new version; and/or dev's and pubs might delist b/c they think the new version gives best experience or they don't want to confuse the market on what versions to buy/play.

But, I am all about options. I don't like de-listing old-stuff; that's not always the best idea - as you have stuff like GTA Trilogy Definitive issues, where it ain't ideal over the old versions. I'm not entirely fond of de-listing old-versions and then say packaging them only to be sold along w/ new version as a bonus/extra - but, that's still better than flat-out throwing the old-version entirely into the trash-bin.

But, then you have other problems that can happen w/ new version. Depending on how dev's and pub's approach it, new version can over-write old version in updates and cause other problems (i.e. breaking old mods) - see **Skyrim Special/Anniversary**. Skyrim is modded insanely...and updates can break mods.

So, a while ago, **Legendary mods didn't work on Special**, but at least BOTH were separate entries entirely on Steam. Meaning, new version of Special did NOT over-write Legendary's files and/or break Legendary's mods that you might have installed - so, if you didn't opt to install Special or didn't run Special, you're good on mods and all, as these entries are separate; just use that Legendary version. Heck, if you want - install both; you can always later float over to Special, once you're good w/ your old version and old mods from Legendary & are done w/ those.

Now, since **Anniversary**'s an update for Special, Anniversary broke mods for Special - so you got to go through all kinds of mess, just to get back to Special (i.e. downgraders some modders made) and it don't help Steam will at some point force updates. Sometimes, I wish old games would get their DRM and client-app crap pulled or show-up on GOG - just so I can run those old-versions without forced updates and w/out any non-sense attached.

Same w/ **GTA4.** Newest version on PC ain't entirely ideal in many ways, so....you might be best off using down-graders, if you got mods and/or you are trying to use DXVK to improve performance greatly. Same can go **w/ GTA3, VC, and SA** \- you're best off using mods, to improve performance, features, and other stuff...even though those ain't even sold on Steam anymore.

About **Cyberpunk 2077** \- really good game, provided you got the PC to handle it. Disappointing game, sure (b/c of insane hype; left-out features like wall-running; Pacifia feels unfinished and lacking in content; etc etc) - but still really good, none-the-less. And yes, that never should've been put on old consoles; this should only be on PC, PS5, and XSS/XSX. As usual, at launch - CDP's games are buggy as heck, poor performing, unstable, and got issues galore...and STILL might not entirely do well on the newest of hardware, nevermind old hardware. Since I've had on Day 1 say Witcher 1, 2, and 3 - yep, been there; experienced this mess. Glad I waited a bit on CP, before buying it; and it was worth my wait, w/ patches behind it and running on a RTX 3070-based PC. Normally, their games are in great shape, only once lots of patches are behind them and/or say a Complete Edition or Enhanced Edition comes along.

        Ah, rip then
            Lmaooooo OOF
        Damn was looking for a god damn switch port, i think is still possible but Rockstar wouldn't make that effort and it would result in shit probably , they should give it to the people who ported Doom (Without online for sure)
        where can I get it?
        Any links?
            It is not released yet check levitation_4d youtube channel for more information : https://youtube.com/c/LEVITATION4DYT
So is this for real? If so I’m gonna take a break from gaming for a bit and support something else in my life.
 grove street games at it again.

        That was clearly a joke
            [deleted]
                Some people might think it’s real and there are some comments that are hard to differentiate and see if it’s a joke or not, but that one was clearly a joke
I don’t think an 8 year old game needs a lite version.
    You'd be surprised just how many people still want to play GTA 5 but never got the chance. Most likely they're from third world countries who don't have good computers (I am from a third world country so I'd know). Even if GTA 5 can run on somewhat low to medium end pcs, it definitely can't run on computers that can only run MS Office applications, and many people in third world countries have that PC specs. So having this mod would honestly be great for everyone who couldn't enjoy the game but now can.

Edit: spelling mistake
        I am from a third world country, one of the poorest actually and people have been playing GTA 5 on low end computers since the pc version came out. People are generally happy to be able to play the game in the first place, no one gives 2 shits about 120fps and 4k visuals in the middle of Central America. High end PCs from 2015/16 are low end now in 2023, cheap and easy to come by.
finally
Niko Bellic lol
HOW ABOUT YOU SUCK MY C! HUH?
Still love the story
So you telling me my outdated computer will be able to handle this game?
How fucking low end does a pc need to be to play a game from fucking 2013?
When raspberry pi support? Lol
I’m sure it could run on switch
I think you mean Grand Theft Auto V: The Definitive Edition
Everyone: give GTA VI
Rockstar, how about GTA V remaster with GTA IV graphics?
GTA V worse and reduced edition
The game is 8 years old.Whos PC can't run it?
Everything EXCEPT GTA 6
Does it really take much to animate their mouths? Or will that make it run significantly slower? I mean, I’d sacrifice a few frames for mouth animation but not heaps.
Call me weird but I think it would be cool if there was a mod of GTA 5 where the graphics were like Oldschool RuneScape and the audio was bit compressed like Duke Nukem 3D on the Build Engine
FINALLY I CAN PLAY
GTA 5 Lite Gameplay Trailer : https://youtu.be/IimB7p4LOKs
If you can’t run gtaV on your pc, maybe that just a sign it’s time to upgrade.
For Switch?
Ngl Michael looks good on low end
r/Lowspecgaming
This is a fucking joke right?
Who ever asked for 'light' Gta 5 ??? Will they never stop milking this poor cow???
    It’s a fanmade mod so not really a milking scheme
        Fan made mod.. then it's cool.. my bad.
    Surprised that the poor cow is even still alive... I'd rather her misery to end. I cannot *happily* drink this cup of milk. 😢🥛
    I know. People who wants to play the game even though they have really low-spec rigs like me.
what? gta v launched on PS3, i believe cheapest GPU will do very good running original GTA V?
Isn’t GTA5 already low end at this point?
Ah come on the game is from 2013, even my microwave can run it nowadays!
Micheal looks like nikko bellic, in lite version 💀
i'd actually like that for my PC. enjoyed it with massive amounts of lags, i want to enjoy it without lags
Mobile version when?
the ps3 version looks way better than this
Don’t tell me this is real
    This is real, it is a mod made by fans
My pc needs a lite version of the lite version, it would still be 10 fps lol
This is cool and all, but damn, GTA V run in any toaster or smart fridge these days.
Looks like he’s having a stroke
When will they stop milking this fucking game and just make gta 6 or pay attention to red dead online or whatever
    It's a fan made mod
[removed]
    This is not made by Rockstar, this is a mod made by fans.
Hope this is a joke. If not Rockstar went from my favorite gaming company to one that I’m embarrassed to admit was my favorite gaming company.
    This is made by levitation_4d not by rockstar games
        Ok thank god, I’m cool with fans making mods like this for performance but almost shit myself thinking Rockstar was behind this. After the “definitive” edition anything is possible I guess.
What a waste of time, making a lite version for a 8yo game, you telling me you couldn't upgrade your PC in those 8 years
Is this....real?
    This is a mod made by fans.
No one wants this. Think RS would have learned from definitive edition.
    This is not made by Rockstar, this is a mod made by fans.
GTA5 doesn't require a good pc to run at standard graphics settings
Instead of remastering the old gta games to look like gta 5 they remastered gta 5 to look like the old gta games I guess
    This is not made by Rockstar, this is a mod made by fans.
        Lmao thanks for the correction I have no idea what I'm talking about hah
Ok this game bin out for like 8 years make a new one and move on its not even that good
    This is not made by Rockstar, this is a mod made by fans.
Are they planning to make gta 6 anytime soon
    I see you are new here. 
Lol.
So desperate to get it in as many dollar-stuffed hands as they possibly can.  
It's just perverted at this point.
    Its a fan mod, dumbass.
        Oh...
Lol
        Also, thanks for being so understanding
Michael looks like NFS The run protagonist but fat and old.
The shadows remind me of Doom 3
Just needs a little mouth movement and its perfect
Soon on mobile? And online mobile 2?
Die Verdammten Armen!
its kinda amazing for a lite version to look like this
Why though? Even PCs with AMD or Intel integrated graphics can run this game on normal graphics at 720p/900p. I'm a budget gamer and I don't need this (using a GTX 1050 ti), I hope it's some joke or mobile version.
aah! Is that micheal when he used to go out from school to get fries, milkshakes...


Legends continue the line
What'd they do to my boy Mikey? 😂😂😂
[deleted]
    This is real, its a mod made by fans
I’m kinda surprised the Switch hasn’t got a port of 5 yet, especially with Take-Two milking the game as much as they have. The 720p PS3/360 version would probably play fine on it, maybe even be more stable. 🤔
Can't wait to see what it looks like on the Nokia 3310....
GTA V is an 8 year old game, I'm sure most systems will be able to run it.
Oh dear
Hell lite almost looks better then the original one
Don’t give them ideas
My switch for GTA graphics is very good
I really wasn't sure of this is real or not.
    This is real, it is a mod made by fans
        I mean real like from rockstar
gta v remaster
I honestly wish this was real, my laptop is so weak
    This is real, its a mod made by fans
Why does Michael have that weird Moustapha though ??
If only they could move ther lips
[deleted]
    It is real check levitation_4d youtube channel for more information : https://youtube.com/c/LEVITATION4DYT
        lol only reason I say that because it looks like someone made a funny by using gta definitive edition graphics
I have no idea if this is a joke or not
    It is not a joke this is real check levitation_4d youtube channel for more information : https://youtube.com/c/LEVITATION4DYT
        Why????
I know this is a kind gesture but please don’t play this cheap mobile game lookin knock off
    This is original gta v modified for low end pc, this is not even for mobile
        Yes ik but it’s very ugly.
God I'd rather burn my retinas out then play that
WHAT THE HELL
GTA 5 ~~Lite~~ Shit

FTFY
Is this real? Because I can’t even tell anymore
    This is real
        Mother of god
I don’t understand… how is a low end PC not able to look as good as the 360 or my plain OG Xbox One?
    Rockstar can't make good pc ports
Took me a few minutes to realize this wasn’t really happening
    It will
        I’m sure it will eventually, I’m still waiting for GTA IV to get a remaster or a mobile port. I’m not interested in playing a mobile GTA but I would LOVE to go back to Liberty City as Nico, but with the “quality of life” upgrades like the much better Driving mechanics of V and shooting mechanics of V as well
Why?
Who is making this?
    Levitation_4d : https://youtube.com/c/LEVITATION4DYT
Looks like gta 4
why micheal look like dat tho?
thats not Michael anymore, now is Mike Old
anything but gta 6
    This is not made by Rockstar, this is a mod made by fans.
        ah that makes sense
It will run at a perfect 20 FPS on my PS4
Definitely better Rockstar spending time on this rather than GTA VI. So glad to have this game on 3 different generations of consoles, high end PCs and now a low-end PC version. Sweet.
    Can't believe there are so many people here that think this is an actual version rockstar is working on, and not a mod. How is it possible to be so dumb?
As a fella with an outdated laptop, I’m hyped. Hope some good car and character mods will be available
Milking gtaV  is not even near to end
    This is not made by Rockstar, this is a mod made by fans.
Rockstar is actively looking for reasons not to make gta 6 at this point lmfao
    What?
    This is not made by Rockstar, this is a mod made by fans.
Actually looking like Michael DeSanta
😂😂😂😂😂
Bro just get an old Xbox one for the price of a new game. Problem solved
I can now play gta on my potato
GTA SA MOD?
This is nasty
Why does this sound like something rstar would pull out of their ass and charge 60$ for
This looks like some shit they're gonna try and drop on mobile.
Ethanm
u/savevideobot
An 8 year old game is coming out with a "low end pc" version?  As in Low-end 2013 PC? or low end 2021 PC?
GTA V Definitive Edition in 2033
So like the trilogy but slightly better🤣
Lmao looks like GTA remaster
For the record: R☆ can smd
    This is not made by Rockstar, this is a mod made by fans.
Why do I like the lite version better lol
There's a saying for constant shit like this I think we can all relate to after 8 god damn years 


LET IT DIE LET IT DIE LET IT SHRIVEL UP AND DIE
    This is not made by Rockstar, this is a mod made by fans.
        It's been going on for 8 god damn years and RS is making millions off GTA online because no life nobodies are putting there life savings into shark card the community needs to pull out of GTA online perminently for there to be an official project americas
It looks completely different
Yuck
Michael looks like Orlando Bloom in the lite version
Is it me or does this actually look worse than the ps3 version lol
Includes new heist! Your money! Release soon and you can play after the soon.
It reminds me of GTA IV
That looks worse than the Xbox 360 version.
The real question is, will PS2 be able to run it
Compressed and downgraded
What's more light than a game made for Xbox 360
I thought you can run V on a overclocked microwave, who needs this
heavy gta Michael 
lite gta. Mickelson
Lmao they already made “expanded and enhanced” so now they have to make “Shrunk and Diminished”
So Niko Bellic stole Michael's clothes
The game came out 6 years ago . It’s already optimized for low end PCs
This is the mobile version XD
12yo kid: "I want GTA V!"

Mother: "We have GTA V at home."

GTA V at home:
Come on even the mobile game Gangstar looks better than that
What's next? GTA V on mobile?
Would be a cool switch version 🤷‍♂️
It runs more than adequate on my GT710, shit is so old...
Leaked gta 5 nintendo switch gameplay
I just finished GTA V on PC. I don't worry about graphics that much and will definitely buy GTA IV one of these days.
what a actual f!(¤" is that:)
So Michael turns into Roman ???
Yo mean the upcoming expanded and enhanced edition right?
They’re doing everything except making gta6 😂
Michael looks like he is straight out of a Spanish telenovela
The definitive edition
How can I mod my gta5 if I downloaded it from the rockstar website it keeps telling me I altered the game and kicks me offline
guys plss tell me can i add menyoo mod in gta 5 lite plss
    Yes you can
        cool thanks:D
May I ask system requirements

-me who can run GTA 5 at 60 FPS highest
Defective Edition
Yo take my fucking award and gtfo
Diarrhea edition
lmaoooooooo okay hear me out i dont have an award but you sure deserve one rn
    I gotchu
I highly doubt Grove Street Games could pull something like this off.
    Oh they could pull it off alright, but with even worse performance than the original gta v
        I sense an incoming name change in the works...

***"Forum Drive Games"***

A unique, non-cliché kinda ring to it, no?
            Excuse me while I steal that name for my game
            Interesting fact: their name isn’t related to Grove Street of GTA:SA, but comes from the fact that the studio is headquartered in the neighborhood of Grove Street, in Gainesville, Florida.

Edit: grammar
            It needs to be something related and iconic to GTA games imo. Maybe the name of that vice city strip club?
        And with missing bridges everywhere
        While somehow requiring higher pc specs that Red Dead 2 lol.
    Straight Busta Games
    They can certainly do better, as long as take two isn't whipping the 20 or so employees and forcing them to release the game in 2 months.
        I don't think the publishers demanded the games look like shitty bootleg mobile trash
            It looks like that because they had to work on porting 3 games to a completely different engine while under a strict deadline and budget. I'm honestly surprised the game doesn't look super horrendous given the circumstances. I believe it would've looked better if they had more time, or money, or employees.
                Old comment, but I agree. ~20 people working on 3 games each of which are this huge? It's a miracle they don't look worse. I actually feel bad for them; it really is Rockstar's fault. They pretty much set up GSG as the fall guys.
        there is no excuses, they didn't even fixed their own android bugs so the "20 employee" thing is lame, hire more people it was clear that they couldnt handle a project this size
it's the yee yee ass haircut games making it.
I hope it is Hove Beach Games version.
Obviously not. 

All of the ground is present. There are no massive holes into the void, or bridges missing.

They don’t even have a black dudes face on the side  of the pier…
Naw, Bethesda.
Pretty sure its an attempt at a GTA V mobile version, yeah.
    That would be actually cool
It is a fan-made mod that Rockstar lawyers are most likely already working on shutting down now that this post has been made.
How about Soulja games?
GTA 4 still looks great today, overrated comment
    Stop kissing IV's ass please, i love it but its not that great.
        said like a true dumbass that never played gta IV
            Jesus Christ, you are actually stupid. Imagine calling someone a dumbass for pointing out y'all are full of some nostalgia shit. I've played plenty of IV; plot was great, missions were boring, go from A to B and kill, driving was fun, fighting was satisfying, ragdoll was amazing, car damage is cool but the game looks dated, no denying that. Y'all attacking someone over a videogame opinion and similar dumb shit is the reason why i left this sub.
                jesus you got so mad bro calm down, there are worse things to get angry over than a conflicting video game opinion
                    Opinion ≠ insults
                        if you’re getting this angry over being called a dumbass on the internet please delete all social media apps
                            Well, if you think a solution would be to let the internet rot with toxic people like you and you think thats normal, please seek a therapist to help you out. 

FYI - not mad, just frustrated.
                cope harder
                    Replying to a 5 month old comment

Dedicated dicksucker
            Gta 4 has terrible mechanics but the graphics aren't that bad.
                Except if you read any thread in this sub you will see people proclaiming how much they miss GTA IV's mechanics.
                    The walking in particular is super clunky, and turning on all but the best cars is stiff.
                        I adored the driving in GTA 4. It was dramatic, and required skill to maneuver. GTA 5 driving is too stiff and arcadey.
                GTA IV has superior mechanics besides shooting. The car physics were much more realistic and fun, the ragdoll physics were fun and hilarious. And the helicopter was more difficult and felt more surreal
        Not my fault you play GTA 4 with the lowest settings, only way I can think of that this mod would look equivalent
            I never compared this mod to IV. But it is your fault for bullshit assumptions, i've played IV maxed out and its nothing special, the game is a blurry mess with that depth of field bullshit (unless you turn on definition, but you lose motion blur). Good thing you could find plenty graphical mods to fix it, and my rig runs V better than IV, because the port was rubbish unfortunately.
        Piece of shit
            ?
    stop gargling IV’s balls. Yeah it’s great, but in comparasion to V, shit’s quite low-end.
        I think fortnite’s pretty bad actually
            What the actual fuck does Fortnite have to do with this? And even so, I think that looks better than IV.
                On nintendo switch it looks terrible so no
                    IV on a potato looks pretty bad. That means absolutely nothing. IV on the max settings on a high end PC looks way worse than Fortnite on the same condition. Just, stop.
                        Well ive never played on a potato before so I wouldn’t know
                IV has good graphics if u put them all on the highest settings and why do u care so much about the graphics the story is 50x better then gta V
                    We are talking strictly about graphics, you moron. He said these “look like a GTA 4 mod”. That’s beacuse of their fucking looks, not the game’s story.
                        I dont like being strictly
Yeah but no kidding, the lighting/colors and the lack of anti alias make this look like GTA5 running in GTA4 engine. This was my immediate thought upon seeing the video.
I think your memory of GTA 4 might be slightly fudged
    I think yours is, because it looks just like 4
        Only the wonky character models. Pretty sure GTA 4 looks way better.
            Correct, I re-played 4 the other month and it looked much better than this yeh the characters aren’t but the floor and environmental textures are
            GTA IV came out in 2008 -- 13 years ago. I think people have nostalgia beer goggles on when talking about the game. It was revolutionary for its time but has aged considerably compared to modern AAA titles.
                Nah I still regularly go back and play it because gta 5 was just never fun to me, and the graphics have held up just fine for a game in 2008.
                I literally was just doing a playthrough of IV less than 2 months ago. This looks pretty similar if not worse because of the lack of mouth movements and environment.
        my dad can beat up ur dad
            I don’t have a dad…
                big ufff
Don't do GTA 4 dirty like that
    It genuinely does though. Compare his face to Gerald McReary's and tell me I'm wrong.

Edit: Nvm, I should've said a GTA IV pedestrian
    I've been playing GTA IV for the last few weeks and I can confirm this looks exactly like GTA IV.
He went from a 45 year old cringe dad to a ruggedly handsome RDR1 cattle rustler with facial paralysis. In some ways, it's an upgrade.
WRONG GTA 4 IS THE BEST JN EVERY ASPECT GO PLAY FORNTITE KID
    no u
    Idk if this is a satire but no. Not in graphics, specifically not in graphics
I don't think so
    Fuck, I was already excited to play with my low spec homies :(

Awesome project nonetheless!
        you can play GTA 5 on low end PC, just disable shadows and lower resolution
            Still lags

gta3 had animation rigs for the mouth while gta5 is in full body and face capture
in my case, i have a 4 gb ram laptop, actually my parents think gaming is waste of time (Asian parents)
    Multitasking requires lots of memory and resolution (and higher resolution needs better GPUs). Tell them you need to upgrade for other reasons and slide in a decent GPU. Get creative lol
        oh gosh, Why didn't i think of that
    I too have a 4gb ram pc with an intel platinum processor but it still runs smooth

although the fps drops if you drive too fast but no other problems
        Do you have a Surface go? Even i have Surface Go with Intel Pentium 7th gen, HD 615 and 4gbram was wondering if this thing can run on my toaster.
    Pull the engineering career card. Engineering career = Engineering Courses which often = good deal of "advanced programming". You don't need a gaming rig, you need to be able to troubleshoot advanced algorithms to hit the good marks and you can't let your performances be bogged down by *subpar* hardware. After all, the Americans are buying up 3080's in droves, you need to compete somehow.
        sadly, I dot like it, I like medical
    tbh they are right, gaming is a HUGE waste of time unless you got nothing planned for the day and everything that needed to be complete is completed
        dude I study for 12 hours a day, ai't that enough
            it definitely is more than enough time, i’d say your parents are hypocrites for deeming gaming as a waste of time but studying for 12 hours isn’t... literally mental, i’m just saying everything should be used in moderation even studying, 12 hours? jesus
Once upon a time, a fellow had a janky computer. T'was a Windows Vista computer from 2007, with a few new parts, and primarily running Linux at that point. It struggled even in it's good days to simply play Portal.

That fellow, yearning to really *play* video games for the first time, saved up, and saved up, and saved up.

He constructed his own machine, focusing on the permanent bits like the motherboard, keeping older replaceable parts like video card, and going low on the new parts that could also be replaced later. The plan was, the PC is decent now, but has the basis to be slowly built upon into perfection when cash was about.

Eager to start this journey, a series of most unfortunate things occured.

Crypto miners

Scalpers

Chip shortages

All the parts that were once reasonably attainable now cost more than the whole rest of the PC combined, never to be afforded.

That man now plays on someone elses Xbox and lives sadly ever after.

The end.
Because people don't have money to buy a pc. It's also obviously not for pcs on the current market, but on the market 10 years ago. I have mine for 6 years, but I'm hoping it lasts another 2 years until I get another one.
Obviously not made for PCs currently on the market. People in third world countries don't have the luxury to afford one.
Some PC users are probably using crummy iGPU's and have a real lack of regular RAM amounts. In other words, some are buying non-gaming PC's to basically run gaming stuff. 

That's NEVER a good idea, as games & requirements still are WAY beyond what iGPU's can do; and dev's don't always optimize the crap out of their games either.
We are no all Americans
Probably because too many people try to run games on their Shared or old family pc. The game is targeted towards 18+ but there is still a large demographic of younger people who rely solely on their parents money or computers
4gb ram laptop gang
    Increase your ram and you'll play it on anything, even if it's just 6gb.
        I have 32 gb in my Ryzen 3 laptop and it doesn't run well on lowest settings
            Well, mine has 6gb ram, a fucking intel celeron j3455 and a gt 1030 ddr4. It runs fine. Actually, i almost finished rdr2 with it, only with 3 fps around wagons, just couldn't keep playing a game like it with the lowest graphics, it doesn't feel right.
                Good call. Like you said it’s just not right to do with a game like RDR2. I was playing 5-12 FPS on Witcher 3 😭 gave up after 30 minutes lol
                Ayo I found my people. Relatable af
                This is where consoles come in handy
                At least yours has dedicated graphics I'm using the Vega graphics
            maybe u need more than just RAM bro 🤣🤣 sounds like a graphics card issue or sum
                I actually need more ram so I can run them in dual channel cause one is slower than the other I got them for free so I could not choose the frequency of them and one is like 2400mhz and the other one is 3200 mhz
            Why would a manufacturer ship a weak ass lappy with 32 gb of ram?
                he has extended the ram
            Why are you lying i played it on core 2 quad, gt 9500gt and 4gb ram it run great on low settings
                It doesn't run good on integrated laptop graphics
        Lol what you joking right ? Maybe it's an issue with my pc but 16gb ram i7-4790 and a 2060 super and still get below 60 frames on medium to low
            there's something wrong with your PC, i7 4790 and RTX 2060 must run GTA 5 100+ fps at 1080p if you disable few most intensive settings.
                Pls don't make me cry, I don't have any more money.

Tbh the anti aliasing is really taxing on the GPU but besides that I get barely and performance difference if I change from high or low. It's always below 60fps - btw this is only for GTA online (in story it runs pretty smooth)
            dude i have a 2060 super with 16gb ram and a ryzen 7 2700 and i play on the high settings with minimal frame drops in 1440p....whats wrong with your computer??
                What do you think it could be?
    >4gb ram 

This game ran on last last gen consoles with 0.5gb ram. PS3 and 360 are 14 years old and it runs on them.

Standard GTA 5 minimum PC requirements is already 4gb

I feel like with this much effort it would make more sense to do with a more newer game like Red Dear Redemption 2 rather than an 8 year old game that runs on everything already.

Well, believe it or not, there are still people who want to enjoy the game but cannot afford a 1500€ gaming laptop
    You don't need a $1500 computer to run gta5 lol
        My pc is $500 and it runs on almost max settings, my old $200 laptop ran gta decently too
            I have a $1000 PC that can barely run the calculator
        You do if you want to be able to run it half decently
            Game runs on PS3 dude. Its not that demanding of a game.
            I've built a pc for 500 bucks and it runs gta on low on 60 fps.
                yeah but thats not the same as running the game on high 120fps… If im gonna buy a gaming PC, im going to get the best u can get, otherwise it literally makes absolutely no sense as u can buy a console for 400-500 and get beautiful graphics with 60fps 😂😂 Thats like playing fortnite or something on ALL low graphics i mean is it rlly enjoyable at that point??
            Not really, i have a like 400$ desktop and only thing i can't turn up is textures.
                It's different for most of the countries. Here in India, for example, you'd have to pay nearly 1000$ for the same desktop you have. And the average income here is much less than your country. I'm sure it would be similar(or worse) in many developing countries.
    Lmao it ran on my shitty 2010 250€ PC.
        Yeah it runs on mine too, but it's laggy, missing textures and the fps is terrible
            Then your cpu or gpu is shitty. People who built their pcs with the proper parts don't have this issue.
    Dude, GTA V has a 2008 GPU for minimum requirements
    > settings, my old $200 laptop ran gta decently to

My 300$ build run gta v on smooth setting without any problem lol
Yeah man not everyone's as rich as you
    You don't need to be rich to have a computer that runs it. It already runs on potato PCs.
        The minimum requirement is like 4 GB RAM bruh
    mate its an 8y/o game

your mum's work laptop could probably run GTA V
        8 year old game that runs on 13 year old game consoles that had 0.5gb of ram.

A smartphone could run GTA5 these days if it was made for them.
        Cmon now, no it won’t lol.
        For some reason, it doesn't work properly on my laptop anymore. Starts lagging after a while. I didn't have any performance issues with it before but now I do and I don't know why or how.
        It can run, but then I'm sacrificing half my drive space.
Yea man call me selfish but this is a complete fuckin waste of time lmao
If they release it on switch I’d rebuy it. 

I assume it’s to court the “rest of the world” crowds that play games on smartphones with mouse and keyboard plugged in maybe?
A lot of people try to run it on non gaming laptops with either basic dedicated GPU or integrated ones. They don't have desktops either because of money or space reasons
They've been milking gtav so hard for so long they finally had to start downgrading it to justify another release
They (dev's and pub's) are making these so-called "new" versions around "newer" hardware - **especially for newer consoles**, since in many ways, those don't often do tons of emulation for older-gen consoles & games - and they are "remastering" them with improved textures, resolution support, newer graphics bells & whistles, etc.

The above all that I mentioned, of course, is going to spike-up the requirements...b/c they're testing the new version on newer hardware, for THIS era; and who knows if they are also implementing real support for new graphics bells & whistle features; 4K texture support; etc etc.

Also, these dev's and pub's want $$$, so that's why they re-sell them and "Remaster" them. They are basically cutting support off old versions to get you to be up-sold to those NEW versions, so you move over to the NEW versions and buy that version.

They are also doing this to see if there's possible interest in more expansions for an old-game (i.e. see what Nordic's done Amular: Re-Reckoning w/ just releasing Fatesworn DLC and Titan Quest: Anniversary w/ its NEW 3 DLC's of Atlantis, Ragnarok, Eternal Embers DLC's)  and/or if it's worth making sequels (ME: Legendary sold well, so you know there'll be a new Mass Effect game). So, given all of that...why wouldn't they do remaster/remake stuff if consumers want them & will throw $ at them?

**It's all about $$$$.**

So, that's why the old versions exists: so it can run on old hardware from back then and also likely perform very well on modern hardware. On PC, this shouldn't be much of an issue here to run old-stuff on new stuff, whether modders fix it to work on new systems or an official dev-made re-release happens. But on consoles, there would likely need to be support for emulation of old-hardware for it to work on new hardware; or dev's would just have to port the game over directly to new hardware properly.

**The new versions ain't meant for old hardware**; it's meant for the current stuff of hardware & software - even if they ain't properly updated the old game very much in many ways.

The real problems are:

1. A lot of dev's & pub's keep DELISTING the old-versions, making it only easy to get the over-priced new version for $50-70 MSRP so they can force players to be up-sold to the new version and buy the new version, only making bank only off the new version.
2. And/or they just don't bundle & package the old-versions along w/ the REMASTERS, just in case stuff goes horribly wrong (i.e. go see GTA Trilogy Definitive, as the case of a Remaster gone WRONG).
    All very valid points. I like seeing older games run on newer hardware with improvements for sure! If a re-release grows the audience and community and gives the game a sequel then that’s great too. 
It’s those last points you mentioned that really get to me about the game industry at the moment. I guess for the casual consumer they might think to buy the cheaper version of the game if there are two versions available, then realise that it’s not optimised or the best version for their hardware so they de-list the old version.
Then we have Cyberpunk 2077 that was made for high end PCs of today but also sold on hardware from 7+ years ago. (Won’t go down that rabbit hole now!)
I personally think if the game can run smoothly,   even if it doesn’t look the best, then it’s playable on older hardware. In saying that, I think the consumer should be made aware of that though and that if they want the ‘best’ experience then buy better hardware. That way the game companies can maximise their profit without compromising their integrity.
        You have a point about the consumer buying the old-version and then realizing it ain't optimized, they need to mod it to get it working (if on PC), etc etc - so they (consumers) might just opt for new version; and/or dev's and pubs might delist b/c they think the new version gives best experience or they don't want to confuse the market on what versions to buy/play.

But, I am all about options. I don't like de-listing old-stuff; that's not always the best idea - as you have stuff like GTA Trilogy Definitive issues, where it ain't ideal over the old versions. I'm not entirely fond of de-listing old-versions and then say packaging them only to be sold along w/ new version as a bonus/extra - but, that's still better than flat-out throwing the old-version entirely into the trash-bin.

But, then you have other problems that can happen w/ new version. Depending on how dev's and pub's approach it, new version can over-write old version in updates and cause other problems (i.e. breaking old mods) - see **Skyrim Special/Anniversary**. Skyrim is modded insanely...and updates can break mods.

So, a while ago, **Legendary mods didn't work on Special**, but at least BOTH were separate entries entirely on Steam. Meaning, new version of Special did NOT over-write Legendary's files and/or break Legendary's mods that you might have installed - so, if you didn't opt to install Special or didn't run Special, you're good on mods and all, as these entries are separate; just use that Legendary version. Heck, if you want - install both; you can always later float over to Special, once you're good w/ your old version and old mods from Legendary & are done w/ those.

Now, since **Anniversary**'s an update for Special, Anniversary broke mods for Special - so you got to go through all kinds of mess, just to get back to Special (i.e. downgraders some modders made) and it don't help Steam will at some point force updates. Sometimes, I wish old games would get their DRM and client-app crap pulled or show-up on GOG - just so I can run those old-versions without forced updates and w/out any non-sense attached.

Same w/ **GTA4.** Newest version on PC ain't entirely ideal in many ways, so....you might be best off using down-graders, if you got mods and/or you are trying to use DXVK to improve performance greatly. Same can go **w/ GTA3, VC, and SA** \- you're best off using mods, to improve performance, features, and other stuff...even though those ain't even sold on Steam anymore.

About **Cyberpunk 2077** \- really good game, provided you got the PC to handle it. Disappointing game, sure (b/c of insane hype; left-out features like wall-running; Pacifia feels unfinished and lacking in content; etc etc) - but still really good, none-the-less. And yes, that never should've been put on old consoles; this should only be on PC, PS5, and XSS/XSX. As usual, at launch - CDP's games are buggy as heck, poor performing, unstable, and got issues galore...and STILL might not entirely do well on the newest of hardware, nevermind old hardware. Since I've had on Day 1 say Witcher 1, 2, and 3 - yep, been there; experienced this mess. Glad I waited a bit on CP, before buying it; and it was worth my wait, w/ patches behind it and running on a RTX 3070-based PC. Normally, their games are in great shape, only once lots of patches are behind them and/or say a Complete Edition or Enhanced Edition comes along.

Fan made mod
    Ah, rip then
        Lmaooooo OOF
    Damn was looking for a god damn switch port, i think is still possible but Rockstar wouldn't make that effort and it would result in shit probably , they should give it to the people who ported Doom (Without online for sure)
    where can I get it?
    Any links?

You'd be surprised just how many people still want to play GTA 5 but never got the chance. Most likely they're from third world countries who don't have good computers (I am from a third world country so I'd know). Even if GTA 5 can run on somewhat low to medium end pcs, it definitely can't run on computers that can only run MS Office applications, and many people in third world countries have that PC specs. So having this mod would honestly be great for everyone who couldn't enjoy the game but now can.

Edit: spelling mistake
    I am from a third world country, one of the poorest actually and people have been playing GTA 5 on low end computers since the pc version came out. People are generally happy to be able to play the game in the first place, no one gives 2 shits about 120fps and 4k visuals in the middle of Central America. High end PCs from 2015/16 are low end now in 2023, cheap and easy to come by.
It’s a fanmade mod so not really a milking scheme
    Fan made mod.. then it's cool.. my bad.
Surprised that the poor cow is even still alive... I'd rather her misery to end. I cannot *happily* drink this cup of milk. 😢🥛
I know. People who wants to play the game even though they have really low-spec rigs like me.
This is real, it is a mod made by fans

    Ok thank god, I’m cool with fans making mods like this for performance but almost shit myself thinking Rockstar was behind this. After the “definitive” edition anything is possible I guess.

This is original gta v modified for low end pc, this is not even for mobile
    Yes ik but it’s very ugly.
This is real
    Mother of god
Rockstar can't make good pc ports
It will
    I’m sure it will eventually, I’m still waiting for GTA IV to get a remaster or a mobile port. I’m not interested in playing a mobile GTA but I would LOVE to go back to Liberty City as Nico, but with the “quality of life” upgrades like the much better Driving mechanics of V and shooting mechanics of V as well

    It's been going on for 8 god damn years and RS is making millions off GTA online because no life nobodies are putting there life savings into shark card the community needs to pull out of GTA online perminently for there to be an official project americas
Yes you can
    cool thanks:D
I gotchu
Oh they could pull it off alright, but with even worse performance than the original gta v
    I sense an incoming name change in the works...

***"Forum Drive Games"***

A unique, non-cliché kinda ring to it, no?
        Excuse me while I steal that name for my game
        Interesting fact: their name isn’t related to Grove Street of GTA:SA, but comes from the fact that the studio is headquartered in the neighborhood of Grove Street, in Gainesville, Florida.

Edit: grammar
        It needs to be something related and iconic to GTA games imo. Maybe the name of that vice city strip club?
    And with missing bridges everywhere
    While somehow requiring higher pc specs that Red Dead 2 lol.
Straight Busta Games
They can certainly do better, as long as take two isn't whipping the 20 or so employees and forcing them to release the game in 2 months.
    I don't think the publishers demanded the games look like shitty bootleg mobile trash
        It looks like that because they had to work on porting 3 games to a completely different engine while under a strict deadline and budget. I'm honestly surprised the game doesn't look super horrendous given the circumstances. I believe it would've looked better if they had more time, or money, or employees.
            Old comment, but I agree. ~20 people working on 3 games each of which are this huge? It's a miracle they don't look worse. I actually feel bad for them; it really is Rockstar's fault. They pretty much set up GSG as the fall guys.
    there is no excuses, they didn't even fixed their own android bugs so the "20 employee" thing is lame, hire more people it was clear that they couldnt handle a project this size
That would be actually cool
Stop kissing IV's ass please, i love it but its not that great.
    said like a true dumbass that never played gta IV
        Jesus Christ, you are actually stupid. Imagine calling someone a dumbass for pointing out y'all are full of some nostalgia shit. I've played plenty of IV; plot was great, missions were boring, go from A to B and kill, driving was fun, fighting was satisfying, ragdoll was amazing, car damage is cool but the game looks dated, no denying that. Y'all attacking someone over a videogame opinion and similar dumb shit is the reason why i left this sub.
            jesus you got so mad bro calm down, there are worse things to get angry over than a conflicting video game opinion
                Opinion ≠ insults
                    if you’re getting this angry over being called a dumbass on the internet please delete all social media apps
                        Well, if you think a solution would be to let the internet rot with toxic people like you and you think thats normal, please seek a therapist to help you out. 

FYI - not mad, just frustrated.

Dedicated dicksucker
        Gta 4 has terrible mechanics but the graphics aren't that bad.
            Except if you read any thread in this sub you will see people proclaiming how much they miss GTA IV's mechanics.
                The walking in particular is super clunky, and turning on all but the best cars is stiff.
                    I adored the driving in GTA 4. It was dramatic, and required skill to maneuver. GTA 5 driving is too stiff and arcadey.
            GTA IV has superior mechanics besides shooting. The car physics were much more realistic and fun, the ragdoll physics were fun and hilarious. And the helicopter was more difficult and felt more surreal
    Not my fault you play GTA 4 with the lowest settings, only way I can think of that this mod would look equivalent
        I never compared this mod to IV. But it is your fault for bullshit assumptions, i've played IV maxed out and its nothing special, the game is a blurry mess with that depth of field bullshit (unless you turn on definition, but you lose motion blur). Good thing you could find plenty graphical mods to fix it, and my rig runs V better than IV, because the port was rubbish unfortunately.
    Piece of shit
        ?
stop gargling IV’s balls. Yeah it’s great, but in comparasion to V, shit’s quite low-end.
    I think fortnite’s pretty bad actually
        What the actual fuck does Fortnite have to do with this? And even so, I think that looks better than IV.
            On nintendo switch it looks terrible so no
                IV on a potato looks pretty bad. That means absolutely nothing. IV on the max settings on a high end PC looks way worse than Fortnite on the same condition. Just, stop.
                    Well ive never played on a potato before so I wouldn’t know
            IV has good graphics if u put them all on the highest settings and why do u care so much about the graphics the story is 50x better then gta V
                We are talking strictly about graphics, you moron. He said these “look like a GTA 4 mod”. That’s beacuse of their fucking looks, not the game’s story.
                    I dont like being strictly
I think yours is, because it looks just like 4
    Only the wonky character models. Pretty sure GTA 4 looks way better.
        Correct, I re-played 4 the other month and it looked much better than this yeh the characters aren’t but the floor and environmental textures are
        GTA IV came out in 2008 -- 13 years ago. I think people have nostalgia beer goggles on when talking about the game. It was revolutionary for its time but has aged considerably compared to modern AAA titles.
            Nah I still regularly go back and play it because gta 5 was just never fun to me, and the graphics have held up just fine for a game in 2008.
            I literally was just doing a playthrough of IV less than 2 months ago. This looks pretty similar if not worse because of the lack of mouth movements and environment.
    my dad can beat up ur dad
        I don’t have a dad…
            big ufff
It genuinely does though. Compare his face to Gerald McReary's and tell me I'm wrong.

Edit: Nvm, I should've said a GTA IV pedestrian
I've been playing GTA IV for the last few weeks and I can confirm this looks exactly like GTA IV.
no u
Idk if this is a satire but no. Not in graphics, specifically not in graphics
Fuck, I was already excited to play with my low spec homies :(

Awesome project nonetheless!
    you can play GTA 5 on low end PC, just disable shadows and lower resolution
        Still lags
            specs?

Multitasking requires lots of memory and resolution (and higher resolution needs better GPUs). Tell them you need to upgrade for other reasons and slide in a decent GPU. Get creative lol
    oh gosh, Why didn't i think of that
I too have a 4gb ram pc with an intel platinum processor but it still runs smooth

although the fps drops if you drive too fast but no other problems
    Do you have a Surface go? Even i have Surface Go with Intel Pentium 7th gen, HD 615 and 4gbram was wondering if this thing can run on my toaster.
Pull the engineering career card. Engineering career = Engineering Courses which often = good deal of "advanced programming". You don't need a gaming rig, you need to be able to troubleshoot advanced algorithms to hit the good marks and you can't let your performances be bogged down by *subpar* hardware. After all, the Americans are buying up 3080's in droves, you need to compete somehow.
    sadly, I dot like it, I like medical
tbh they are right, gaming is a HUGE waste of time unless you got nothing planned for the day and everything that needed to be complete is completed
    dude I study for 12 hours a day, ai't that enough
        it definitely is more than enough time, i’d say your parents are hypocrites for deeming gaming as a waste of time but studying for 12 hours isn’t... literally mental, i’m just saying everything should be used in moderation even studying, 12 hours? jesus
Increase your ram and you'll play it on anything, even if it's just 6gb.
    I have 32 gb in my Ryzen 3 laptop and it doesn't run well on lowest settings
        Well, mine has 6gb ram, a fucking intel celeron j3455 and a gt 1030 ddr4. It runs fine. Actually, i almost finished rdr2 with it, only with 3 fps around wagons, just couldn't keep playing a game like it with the lowest graphics, it doesn't feel right.
            Good call. Like you said it’s just not right to do with a game like RDR2. I was playing 5-12 FPS on Witcher 3 😭 gave up after 30 minutes lol
            Ayo I found my people. Relatable af
            This is where consoles come in handy
            At least yours has dedicated graphics I'm using the Vega graphics
        maybe u need more than just RAM bro 🤣🤣 sounds like a graphics card issue or sum
            I actually need more ram so I can run them in dual channel cause one is slower than the other I got them for free so I could not choose the frequency of them and one is like 2400mhz and the other one is 3200 mhz
        Why would a manufacturer ship a weak ass lappy with 32 gb of ram?
            he has extended the ram
        Why are you lying i played it on core 2 quad, gt 9500gt and 4gb ram it run great on low settings
            It doesn't run good on integrated laptop graphics
    Lol what you joking right ? Maybe it's an issue with my pc but 16gb ram i7-4790 and a 2060 super and still get below 60 frames on medium to low
        there's something wrong with your PC, i7 4790 and RTX 2060 must run GTA 5 100+ fps at 1080p if you disable few most intensive settings.
            Pls don't make me cry, I don't have any more money.

Tbh the anti aliasing is really taxing on the GPU but besides that I get barely and performance difference if I change from high or low. It's always below 60fps - btw this is only for GTA online (in story it runs pretty smooth)
        dude i have a 2060 super with 16gb ram and a ryzen 7 2700 and i play on the high settings with minimal frame drops in 1440p....whats wrong with your computer??
            What do you think it could be?
>4gb ram 

This game ran on last last gen consoles with 0.5gb ram. PS3 and 360 are 14 years old and it runs on them.

Standard GTA 5 minimum PC requirements is already 4gb

I feel like with this much effort it would make more sense to do with a more newer game like Red Dear Redemption 2 rather than an 8 year old game that runs on everything already.

Low end today would be high end in 2013 lol
You don't need a $1500 computer to run gta5 lol
    My pc is $500 and it runs on almost max settings, my old $200 laptop ran gta decently too
        I have a $1000 PC that can barely run the calculator
    You do if you want to be able to run it half decently
        Game runs on PS3 dude. Its not that demanding of a game.
        I've built a pc for 500 bucks and it runs gta on low on 60 fps.
            yeah but thats not the same as running the game on high 120fps… If im gonna buy a gaming PC, im going to get the best u can get, otherwise it literally makes absolutely no sense as u can buy a console for 400-500 and get beautiful graphics with 60fps 😂😂 Thats like playing fortnite or something on ALL low graphics i mean is it rlly enjoyable at that point??
        Not really, i have a like 400$ desktop and only thing i can't turn up is textures.
            It's different for most of the countries. Here in India, for example, you'd have to pay nearly 1000$ for the same desktop you have. And the average income here is much less than your country. I'm sure it would be similar(or worse) in many developing countries.
Lmao it ran on my shitty 2010 250€ PC.
    Yeah it runs on mine too, but it's laggy, missing textures and the fps is terrible
        Then your cpu or gpu is shitty. People who built their pcs with the proper parts don't have this issue.
Dude, GTA V has a 2008 GPU for minimum requirements
> settings, my old $200 laptop ran gta decently to

My 300$ build run gta v on smooth setting without any problem lol
You don't need to be rich to have a computer that runs it. It already runs on potato PCs.
    The minimum requirement is like 4 GB RAM bruh
mate its an 8y/o game

your mum's work laptop could probably run GTA V
    8 year old game that runs on 13 year old game consoles that had 0.5gb of ram.

A smartphone could run GTA5 these days if it was made for them.
    Cmon now, no it won’t lol.
    For some reason, it doesn't work properly on my laptop anymore. Starts lagging after a while. I didn't have any performance issues with it before but now I do and I don't know why or how.
    It can run, but then I'm sacrificing half my drive space.

Then we have Cyberpunk 2077 that was made for high end PCs of today but also sold on hardware from 7+ years ago. (Won’t go down that rabbit hole now!)
I personally think if the game can run smoothly,   even if it doesn’t look the best, then it’s playable on older hardware. In saying that, I think the consumer should be made aware of that though and that if they want the ‘best’ experience then buy better hardware. That way the game companies can maximise their profit without compromising their integrity.
    You have a point about the consumer buying the old-version and then realizing it ain't optimized, they need to mod it to get it working (if on PC), etc etc - so they (consumers) might just opt for new version; and/or dev's and pubs might delist b/c they think the new version gives best experience or they don't want to confuse the market on what versions to buy/play.

But, I am all about options. I don't like de-listing old-stuff; that's not always the best idea - as you have stuff like GTA Trilogy Definitive issues, where it ain't ideal over the old versions. I'm not entirely fond of de-listing old-versions and then say packaging them only to be sold along w/ new version as a bonus/extra - but, that's still better than flat-out throwing the old-version entirely into the trash-bin.

But, then you have other problems that can happen w/ new version. Depending on how dev's and pub's approach it, new version can over-write old version in updates and cause other problems (i.e. breaking old mods) - see **Skyrim Special/Anniversary**. Skyrim is modded insanely...and updates can break mods.

So, a while ago, **Legendary mods didn't work on Special**, but at least BOTH were separate entries entirely on Steam. Meaning, new version of Special did NOT over-write Legendary's files and/or break Legendary's mods that you might have installed - so, if you didn't opt to install Special or didn't run Special, you're good on mods and all, as these entries are separate; just use that Legendary version. Heck, if you want - install both; you can always later float over to Special, once you're good w/ your old version and old mods from Legendary & are done w/ those.

Now, since **Anniversary**'s an update for Special, Anniversary broke mods for Special - so you got to go through all kinds of mess, just to get back to Special (i.e. downgraders some modders made) and it don't help Steam will at some point force updates. Sometimes, I wish old games would get their DRM and client-app crap pulled or show-up on GOG - just so I can run those old-versions without forced updates and w/out any non-sense attached.

Same w/ **GTA4.** Newest version on PC ain't entirely ideal in many ways, so....you might be best off using down-graders, if you got mods and/or you are trying to use DXVK to improve performance greatly. Same can go **w/ GTA3, VC, and SA** \- you're best off using mods, to improve performance, features, and other stuff...even though those ain't even sold on Steam anymore.

About **Cyberpunk 2077** \- really good game, provided you got the PC to handle it. Disappointing game, sure (b/c of insane hype; left-out features like wall-running; Pacifia feels unfinished and lacking in content; etc etc) - but still really good, none-the-less. And yes, that never should've been put on old consoles; this should only be on PC, PS5, and XSS/XSX. As usual, at launch - CDP's games are buggy as heck, poor performing, unstable, and got issues galore...and STILL might not entirely do well on the newest of hardware, nevermind old hardware. Since I've had on Day 1 say Witcher 1, 2, and 3 - yep, been there; experienced this mess. Glad I waited a bit on CP, before buying it; and it was worth my wait, w/ patches behind it and running on a RTX 3070-based PC. Normally, their games are in great shape, only once lots of patches are behind them and/or say a Complete Edition or Enhanced Edition comes along.
Sorry for replying so late but is the channel shut down?
Ah, rip then
    Lmaooooo OOF
Damn was looking for a god damn switch port, i think is still possible but Rockstar wouldn't make that effort and it would result in shit probably , they should give it to the people who ported Doom (Without online for sure)
where can I get it?
Any links?
    It is not released yet check levitation_4d youtube channel for more information : https://youtube.com/c/LEVITATION4DYT
That was clearly a joke

        Some people might think it’s real and there are some comments that are hard to differentiate and see if it’s a joke or not, but that one was clearly a joke
I am from a third world country, one of the poorest actually and people have been playing GTA 5 on low end computers since the pc version came out. People are generally happy to be able to play the game in the first place, no one gives 2 shits about 120fps and 4k visuals in the middle of Central America. High end PCs from 2015/16 are low end now in 2023, cheap and easy to come by.
Fan made mod.. then it's cool.. my bad.
Ok thank god, I’m cool with fans making mods like this for performance but almost shit myself thinking Rockstar was behind this. After the “definitive” edition anything is possible I guess.
Lmao thanks for the correction I have no idea what I'm talking about hah
Oh...
Lol
Also, thanks for being so understanding
I mean real like from rockstar
lol only reason I say that because it looks like someone made a funny by using gta definitive edition graphics
Why????
Yes ik but it’s very ugly.
Mother of god
I’m sure it will eventually, I’m still waiting for GTA IV to get a remaster or a mobile port. I’m not interested in playing a mobile GTA but I would LOVE to go back to Liberty City as Nico, but with the “quality of life” upgrades like the much better Driving mechanics of V and shooting mechanics of V as well
ah that makes sense
It's been going on for 8 god damn years and RS is making millions off GTA online because no life nobodies are putting there life savings into shark card the community needs to pull out of GTA online perminently for there to be an official project americas
cool thanks:D
I sense an incoming name change in the works...

***"Forum Drive Games"***

A unique, non-cliché kinda ring to it, no?
    Excuse me while I steal that name for my game
    Interesting fact: their name isn’t related to Grove Street of GTA:SA, but comes from the fact that the studio is headquartered in the neighborhood of Grove Street, in Gainesville, Florida.

Edit: grammar
    It needs to be something related and iconic to GTA games imo. Maybe the name of that vice city strip club?
And with missing bridges everywhere
While somehow requiring higher pc specs that Red Dead 2 lol.
I don't think the publishers demanded the games look like shitty bootleg mobile trash
    It looks like that because they had to work on porting 3 games to a completely different engine while under a strict deadline and budget. I'm honestly surprised the game doesn't look super horrendous given the circumstances. I believe it would've looked better if they had more time, or money, or employees.
        Old comment, but I agree. ~20 people working on 3 games each of which are this huge? It's a miracle they don't look worse. I actually feel bad for them; it really is Rockstar's fault. They pretty much set up GSG as the fall guys.
there is no excuses, they didn't even fixed their own android bugs so the "20 employee" thing is lame, hire more people it was clear that they couldnt handle a project this size
said like a true dumbass that never played gta IV
    Jesus Christ, you are actually stupid. Imagine calling someone a dumbass for pointing out y'all are full of some nostalgia shit. I've played plenty of IV; plot was great, missions were boring, go from A to B and kill, driving was fun, fighting was satisfying, ragdoll was amazing, car damage is cool but the game looks dated, no denying that. Y'all attacking someone over a videogame opinion and similar dumb shit is the reason why i left this sub.
        jesus you got so mad bro calm down, there are worse things to get angry over than a conflicting video game opinion
            Opinion ≠ insults
                if you’re getting this angry over being called a dumbass on the internet please delete all social media apps
                    Well, if you think a solution would be to let the internet rot with toxic people like you and you think thats normal, please seek a therapist to help you out. 

FYI - not mad, just frustrated.

    Gta 4 has terrible mechanics but the graphics aren't that bad.
        Except if you read any thread in this sub you will see people proclaiming how much they miss GTA IV's mechanics.
            The walking in particular is super clunky, and turning on all but the best cars is stiff.
                I adored the driving in GTA 4. It was dramatic, and required skill to maneuver. GTA 5 driving is too stiff and arcadey.
        GTA IV has superior mechanics besides shooting. The car physics were much more realistic and fun, the ragdoll physics were fun and hilarious. And the helicopter was more difficult and felt more surreal
Not my fault you play GTA 4 with the lowest settings, only way I can think of that this mod would look equivalent
    I never compared this mod to IV. But it is your fault for bullshit assumptions, i've played IV maxed out and its nothing special, the game is a blurry mess with that depth of field bullshit (unless you turn on definition, but you lose motion blur). Good thing you could find plenty graphical mods to fix it, and my rig runs V better than IV, because the port was rubbish unfortunately.
Piece of shit
    ?
I think fortnite’s pretty bad actually
    What the actual fuck does Fortnite have to do with this? And even so, I think that looks better than IV.
        On nintendo switch it looks terrible so no
            IV on a potato looks pretty bad. That means absolutely nothing. IV on the max settings on a high end PC looks way worse than Fortnite on the same condition. Just, stop.
                Well ive never played on a potato before so I wouldn’t know
        IV has good graphics if u put them all on the highest settings and why do u care so much about the graphics the story is 50x better then gta V
            We are talking strictly about graphics, you moron. He said these “look like a GTA 4 mod”. That’s beacuse of their fucking looks, not the game’s story.
                I dont like being strictly
Only the wonky character models. Pretty sure GTA 4 looks way better.
    Correct, I re-played 4 the other month and it looked much better than this yeh the characters aren’t but the floor and environmental textures are
    GTA IV came out in 2008 -- 13 years ago. I think people have nostalgia beer goggles on when talking about the game. It was revolutionary for its time but has aged considerably compared to modern AAA titles.
        Nah I still regularly go back and play it because gta 5 was just never fun to me, and the graphics have held up just fine for a game in 2008.
        I literally was just doing a playthrough of IV less than 2 months ago. This looks pretty similar if not worse because of the lack of mouth movements and environment.
my dad can beat up ur dad
    I don’t have a dad…
        big ufff
you can play GTA 5 on low end PC, just disable shadows and lower resolution
    Still lags
        specs?
            Idaho potato
                No no no 
Wyoming Potatoes
            Pentium 4
oh gosh, Why didn't i think of that
Do you have a Surface go? Even i have Surface Go with Intel Pentium 7th gen, HD 615 and 4gbram was wondering if this thing can run on my toaster.
sadly, I dot like it, I like medical
dude I study for 12 hours a day, ai't that enough
    it definitely is more than enough time, i’d say your parents are hypocrites for deeming gaming as a waste of time but studying for 12 hours isn’t... literally mental, i’m just saying everything should be used in moderation even studying, 12 hours? jesus
I have 32 gb in my Ryzen 3 laptop and it doesn't run well on lowest settings
    Well, mine has 6gb ram, a fucking intel celeron j3455 and a gt 1030 ddr4. It runs fine. Actually, i almost finished rdr2 with it, only with 3 fps around wagons, just couldn't keep playing a game like it with the lowest graphics, it doesn't feel right.
        Good call. Like you said it’s just not right to do with a game like RDR2. I was playing 5-12 FPS on Witcher 3 😭 gave up after 30 minutes lol
        Ayo I found my people. Relatable af
        This is where consoles come in handy
        At least yours has dedicated graphics I'm using the Vega graphics
    maybe u need more than just RAM bro 🤣🤣 sounds like a graphics card issue or sum
        I actually need more ram so I can run them in dual channel cause one is slower than the other I got them for free so I could not choose the frequency of them and one is like 2400mhz and the other one is 3200 mhz
    Why would a manufacturer ship a weak ass lappy with 32 gb of ram?
        he has extended the ram
    Why are you lying i played it on core 2 quad, gt 9500gt and 4gb ram it run great on low settings
        It doesn't run good on integrated laptop graphics
Lol what you joking right ? Maybe it's an issue with my pc but 16gb ram i7-4790 and a 2060 super and still get below 60 frames on medium to low
    there's something wrong with your PC, i7 4790 and RTX 2060 must run GTA 5 100+ fps at 1080p if you disable few most intensive settings.
        Pls don't make me cry, I don't have any more money.

Tbh the anti aliasing is really taxing on the GPU but besides that I get barely and performance difference if I change from high or low. It's always below 60fps - btw this is only for GTA online (in story it runs pretty smooth)
    dude i have a 2060 super with 16gb ram and a ryzen 7 2700 and i play on the high settings with minimal frame drops in 1440p....whats wrong with your computer??
        What do you think it could be?
People who can't afford a better PC?
Third world
My pc is $500 and it runs on almost max settings, my old $200 laptop ran gta decently too
    I have a $1000 PC that can barely run the calculator
You do if you want to be able to run it half decently
    Game runs on PS3 dude. Its not that demanding of a game.
    I've built a pc for 500 bucks and it runs gta on low on 60 fps.
        yeah but thats not the same as running the game on high 120fps… If im gonna buy a gaming PC, im going to get the best u can get, otherwise it literally makes absolutely no sense as u can buy a console for 400-500 and get beautiful graphics with 60fps 😂😂 Thats like playing fortnite or something on ALL low graphics i mean is it rlly enjoyable at that point??
    Not really, i have a like 400$ desktop and only thing i can't turn up is textures.
        It's different for most of the countries. Here in India, for example, you'd have to pay nearly 1000$ for the same desktop you have. And the average income here is much less than your country. I'm sure it would be similar(or worse) in many developing countries.
Yeah it runs on mine too, but it's laggy, missing textures and the fps is terrible
    Then your cpu or gpu is shitty. People who built their pcs with the proper parts don't have this issue.
The minimum requirement is like 4 GB RAM bruh
8 year old game that runs on 13 year old game consoles that had 0.5gb of ram.

A smartphone could run GTA5 these days if it was made for them.
Cmon now, no it won’t lol.
For some reason, it doesn't work properly on my laptop anymore. Starts lagging after a while. I didn't have any performance issues with it before but now I do and I don't know why or how.
It can run, but then I'm sacrificing half my drive space.
You have a point about the consumer buying the old-version and then realizing it ain't optimized, they need to mod it to get it working (if on PC), etc etc - so they (consumers) might just opt for new version; and/or dev's and pubs might delist b/c they think the new version gives best experience or they don't want to confuse the market on what versions to buy/play.

I'm not entirely fond of de-listing old-versions and then say packaging them only to be sold along w/ new version as a bonus/extra - but, that's still better than flat-out throwing the old-version entirely into the trash-bin.

Same can go **w/ GTA3, VC, and SA** \- you're best off using mods, to improve performance, features, and other stuff...even though those ain't even sold on Steam anymore.

About **Cyberpunk 2077** \- really good game, provided you got the PC to handle it. Disappointing game, sure (b/c of insane hype; left-out features like wall-running; Pacifia feels unfinished and lacking in content; etc etc) - but still really good, none-the-less. And yes, that never should've been put on old consoles; this should only be on PC, PS5, and XSS/XSX.

I literally was just doing a playthrough of IV less than 2 months ago. This looks pretty similar if not worse because of the lack of mouth movements and environment.
big ufff
specs?

Good call. Like you said it’s just not right to do with a game like RDR2. I was playing 5-12 FPS on Witcher 3 😭 gave up after 30 minutes lol
Ayo I found my people. Relatable af
This is where consoles come in handy
At least yours has dedicated graphics I'm using the Vega graphics
I actually need more ram so I can run them in dual channel cause one is slower than the other I got them for free so I could not choose the frequency of them and one is like 2400mhz and the other one is 3200 mhz
he has extended the ram
It doesn't run good on integrated laptop graphics
Pls don't make me cry, I don't have any more money.

Tbh the anti aliasing is really taxing on the GPU but besides that I get barely and performance difference if I change from high or low. It's always below 60fps - btw this is only for GTA online (in story it runs pretty smooth)
What do you think it could be?
yeah but thats not the same as running the game on high 120fps… If im gonna buy a gaming PC, im going to get the best u can get, otherwise it literally makes absolutely no sense as u can buy a console for 400-500 and get beautiful graphics with 60fps 😂😂 Thats like playing fortnite or something on ALL low graphics i mean is it rlly enjoyable at that point??
It's different for most of the countries. Here in India, for example, you'd have to pay nearly 1000$ for the same desktop you have. And the average income here is much less than your country. I'm sure it would be similar(or worse) in many developing countries.

The walking in particular is super clunky, and turning on all but the best cars is stiff.
    I adored the driving in GTA 4. It was dramatic, and required skill to maneuver. GTA 5 driving is too stiff and arcadey.
IV on a potato looks pretty bad. That means absolutely nothing. IV on the max settings on a high end PC looks way worse than Fortnite on the same condition. Just, stop.
    Well ive never played on a potato before so I wouldn’t know
We are talking strictly about graphics, you moron. He said these “look like a GTA 4 mod”. That’s beacuse of their fucking looks, not the game’s story.
