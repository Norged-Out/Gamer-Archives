[[Claude Roasts Franklin]]





This entire cutscene still makes sense despite the joke being that claude is a mute.
    The single "what" from Franklin at the end broke me
    Lol 😂
    Hes white so he cant say the N-word so thats why he's muted. Also he cant talk.
        What if Lamar gave him the n word pass

#WHAT!
This is a work of art
"....................What?!"
I could hear that "oh and better yet..."
Deaf people: "Damn he spittin fire!"
Damn Claude is a giant
    In GTA 3 He Is as tall, or an Inch Taller/Shorter than Mickey Hamsfits/Mick Muscle Man(it's difficult to tell beacuse neither stand in a total straight position every time they meet), Who Is 6'7 in the game Files.
He also towers over Donald Love Who Is 6'2 of about Three inches or more, Who Is an Inch/two inches Shorter than Toni Cipriani in GTA Liberty City Stories.

He's in Between the 6'4-6'6 or 6'5-6'7 Range, whereas in GTA SA, when standing Next to Catalina Who Is an actual very tall Woman(Taller than CJ by an Inch), around 5'10-5'11,
Catalina Is as tall as his Chin or a Little below in SA, a whole human sized head takes 4-5 inches at least. He didn't look that tall, around 6'2-6'3 at best, and that was back when he was Still young, which Means his genetics let him grow a Little more Between SA and And 3,
Dude's had some genetics....
        Wasn't Claude Listed as 5'9 in the Game Files Tho?
            That's Claude Speed From GTA 2's First 3D era Model/Claude's First Model imported from his 2D Universe counterpart to 3D.
In fact, back when the Game Files were found, Rockstar hadn't placed the Barrier Between the Universes Yet.

They weren't planning Claude and Claude Speed to be two different characters back then, the Claude You know in 3 did not use to Have a Model at all, infact their Stories used to be almost Identical before even the First release for the actual GTA 3 Came out.

If you look back to his Story in the Files, he Is said to be an American Citizen with a Mole on his Ass Who used to live in Liberty City ever since he was Born, but the Actual Claude in GTA 3 Is said in his Bio Actually have been  growing in San Fierro/California doing Illegal Street Races in his Early-Teen Years, before he retired and moved on to San Andreas/Los Angeles.
Not Only that, Claude Is Also Said to be 29 by the time of GTA 3, but If you consider he is 21 by the time of 1992(when SA takes Place), Claude should be 30 by the time of 3(2001) but he's actually stated to be 29 years old in the Bio, which Is Curious, Since by the time of GTA 2(1999), Claude Speed Is 28 Years old.
 His Clothes were also supposed to Constantly Switch Mission After Mission.

Also, do you Remember Rockstar Saying the "Get out of the Car" Line to Have been modified online by some Hacker? That's actually false, if you go back and Play GTA 2, the actual line used in the Game Is "get out of the Car, Man", not Simply "Get out of the Car" like presented in the GTA 3 Trailer, which Is a Small Difference, but a Difference Nonethless.
So, While It Is true that Some Hacker might've Recorded and modified those soundbytes himself with his own Voice, It might as Well be Possible, Being that they wanted them to be the same, for Rockstar to have used some Beta Voice Soundbyte, and extracted It from some unpublished GTA 2 Beta.

Evidence seems to lean more towards the latter, beacuse a Youtuber actually found some unused dialogue Between Claude and 8-Ball's "Give Me Liberty" and "Chaperone/Pulp Friction" in the game files where Claude actually was supposed to talk.

Also, Claude actually groans and Growls a Little bit when he falls from a Building or Is near-Death conditions, which further Proves Claude and Claude Speed Were supposed to be the Same and he was supposed to Have some voice, but ever since Rockstar Decided to make him a Cold Silent Killer, they've likely Removed any line of Dialogue they planned for him and remade him from scretch as a completely separated character, being unable to do so completely as shown By some still left Soundbytes when he Is near-Death, like previously, probs beacuse they planned too Many voicelines for him to remove them all.

Mickey/Michael Hamsfits has never been in Any Previous GTA Game or hadn't had no Previous Parallel Version of Himself, so there wouldn't be another Model to Remake him After in the First Place.
Lamar and chop just watching it go down 😂😂
Hugh Jackman
    Mute Jackman

        Not that n-word. The other one
That's awesome I love Claude still being a mute.  I would be pissed if he spoke lol
Wait what claude can’t talk 😂
    No he's a mute
Damn Claude said the n word and came out unharmed, as if he didn't say anything at all.
This is funnier than Lamar roasting him.
I felt it when he said "...", damn man Claude is very good at roasting Franklin!
He looks like Nathan Fillion
Please get either Gregory or freddy from fnaf security breach in the cutscene. I would laugh my ass off.
    Bro no...
claude is a racist
Me roasting everyone in my brain
The most awkward thing I’ve ever seen.

Silent and deadly. That was the hardest diss ever
Damn! Claude doesn't pull any punches... I think that was a bit harsh.
Now this is pretty cool
Why does Claude look so out of place?
    Because he's a character from GTA *3*
Claude just said the n word without actually saying it 💀
WHAT!
Love this clip. Claude roasted him good
U/savevideo
The way Franklin say "What" is so realistic because he doesn't understood / heard what Claude said.
