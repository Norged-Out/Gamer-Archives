[[It has been a while...]]





I grew up with GTA 3
    GTA VC and SA. I first got GTA VC then one day I saw SA and picked up that. Love Vice City and San Andreas. Never played OG GTA III on PS2 tho
        The shock I got hearing real life music in an game..
Always will have an soft spot voor VC. Let's hope GTA6 have that 80' vibe
    I grew up with this https://youtu.be/8MWvlp5Hidc
        You are a triple og then dude
        gouranga
    Game was absolutely groundbreaking at the time. The difference between GTA2 and GTA3 was mind boggling. I remember I had a 99% complete game. Only had a few hidden packages to find. My buddy came over and asked to start a new game. Bastard overwrote my game. Never really ended up getting back into it before GTA4 came out.
    GTA IV
    I wasn’t allowed to play GTA until I was 17 lol, so I technically grew up with GTAIV
    Same, GTA 3 all the way.
    Gta 2 here...
    I was in the 9th grade when GTA 3 came out. At this rate I will be in my 70’s by the time GTA 7 is announced
        What a cruel reality
    I grew up with GTA, the original, however, I played gta3 to an absurd length longer than the other games (1 and 2 combined). I think I spent a couple hundred hours playing that game. A good friend of mine from back in the day used to come over and eventually helped start the GTA gaming website (now gone I believe but used to be the best fansite on the web). So to say we were obsessed wouldn't be correct. For a good year there, we only played gta3.
    Same
    Yea I'll was 18-19 when gta v came out
    Same boat as you my friend.
If you grew up with GTA V you must be really young. I grew up with VC and SA.
    I’m a proud Vice City baby
        THAT GAME WAS FANTASTIC! Idk why, but i liked VC more than SA.
            yeah same here, I didn’t really like how SA was more of gang-game, and much preferred the way VC is mostly just you :)
            the soundtrack is the goat for any videogame ever that's why
    Depends what you mean by growing up ive been playing gtav since i was 9.
        I played Vice City since I was 7. Amazing game. I 100% ed it recently. As you grew up with GTA V, I recommend you to try it.
    i mean i was like 7 playing sa and vc but i’m about to be graduating highschool and i’ve been playing gta v since elementary school.....
I grew up with GTA 1, and this does not give me any emotional issues. :)  
You still have time to learn coding and join the GTA 6 team
    I mean yeah but that doesn’t say much. Unborn children still have enough time to learn coding an join the team
        Good point!
Let's hope that the next one will not be 'The GTA' the big open world live service game
    Back when the most shocking thing was GOURANGA!
        Ah, GOURANGA.. The orange-red splatter.
    Damn dude haha
I swear this keeps getting reposted a lot
    Every month GTA 6 isn't announced.
        Or every month when it’s rumored that GTA won’t come out for another 4 years
I grew up with GTA SA
    Me too.
How to get karma on Reddit. Go to r/gta and post something like “gta 5 long time LOL!!!11!!1!”
What I want:  


Either GTA 6 or GTA VC reboot.
    VC reboot, don't bother getting new music, keep that.
        Absolutely. Just more of it. And the ads. Oh god the ads.
            These people volunteered, they aren't getting paid much!
    Apparently they’ll be similar yano, it’s becoming more and more likely that it’ll be vice city, but obviously, yeah a reboot would be great
        It by far have the most iconic vibe of any gta game.

That whole 80s Miami vice, scarface feeling to it.

I'd love it with more of the same style. More radio stations. More music. More of the same ads and radio hosts.
More missions.
Naturally better graphics but a far greater game. And I'd take that over a new gta 6.
    While a reboot is mouthwatering, I don't want to sacrifice modern day hardware such as vehicles and weapons
    +1
Speak for yourself, my first was Gta London
My first it's double pack. I think that i tried GTA3 before VC, but VC it's My favorite. I played GTA 4 until 2016, but i play It somedays. I also have 5 for PS3 and PS4.
    Yes, I did too. The PS2 had 5 GTA's, while GTA V will have 3 PlayStations

Such is the effect of micro-transactions
If you grew up with GTA V then you ARE today's kid
[deleted]
    The game's 8 years old though. If someone started playing when they were 11 they'd be 19 now.
Ey wassup can a loc come up in yo crib
    > Ey wassup can a loc come up in yo crib

Man, fuck you. I'll see you at work
im glad i didnt grew up with that shit.
I grew up a fucking screw up 👀
    Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin' blew up
    Lmao
I grew up with Gta 4
Anyone else grew up with vice city on a psp?
    Me lol loved vcs
I grew up with GTA 1, 2 & 3.  I was 17 when Grand Theft Auto III was released and bought it on release day.  I see the point though...
I played VC when the newest gta was SA, I played LCS and VCS when the latest gta was V. Can't wait to finish the orwious games and play GTA V one day
We grew up with the better gta, the gta now is ass
[deleted]
    Geez man, why do you have to be so negative?
OG birds-eye-view GTAers shaking their heads...
I was 16 in 2013. I’m now 24. Can’t they release gta 6? I would love a SA reboot with graphics that make it like you’re actually looking at someone made in the current time. Not 6 years earlier
u/RepostSleuthBot
Common early release man
Nah we grew up w gta they growing up w gta OnLiNe
Watch E&E blow everything out the waters and we’ll become more patient with VI
Man i realise its been a while i've been playing gtav since i was 9 years old, im 18 in two months.
What my grandson grow up with
me in 2013: Oh my god this game is amazing. I can not wait for GTA 6… playing in Vice City again will be fantastic. My summer break in 2015 will be only about GTA 6 <3
Man I remember SA coming out and how huge the hype was
I grew up with GTA 3, vice city and San Andreas
I remember playing gta 3 on mobile
i grew up with 3 VC and SA i was 20 when V came out lol
I grew up more with IV.
Repost
I got hit with like 100 GTA ads after seeing this
Keep calm and release VI, Rockstar
The difference being that we grew up with story mode they are gone grow up with online
I grew up with my first GTA which was 3
Ok?
Me who grown with GTA SA.... I am old.?
yes
14 but my first gta was San Andreas I personally liked that story more than 5
I started on Liberty City Stories
I was 18 when GTAV came put and I’ll be 30 when GTAVI comes out.
Ha! I’m listening to Staind right now
I grew up with gta sa
I'm 30. I was only 11 years old when I had the amazing pleasure of experiencing the true classics of GTA. 

GTA3 (the first 3d open world GTA game), then Vice City (a time machine back to the 80s before ANYBODY jumped on the bandwagon and now everything is 80s this and 80s that), then came along San Andreas (a multi-state GTA game which was absolutely fun as hell and THEN GTA4! The absolute beast of a game in which it was gritty and dark and detailed and the online was absolute fun and you didnt need shark cards or do virtual jobs to have fun. 

That was all in the space of 7 or 8 years. 

Now look, 10 years later after Gta5 (a.k.a carbon copy San Andreas), kids that were 12 are now 22 and still no new gta game.
What our kids’ kids will grow up with
I grew up with grove st. and cj johnson.
If GTA VI comes out by the he time I retire, then I’ll have time to play it! Then again, hope I don’t die first.
fr ;(
It’s gotta be soon… right…?
ONLY Og's grew up with CJ✨
Now do a gta online version of the top being something like a rhino tank and the bottom being an oppressor.
I grew up with GTA SA.
I grew up with Bully
No the image is not right let me tell you we grew up with 3,VC,SA,IV and even V but today's kids grow up with GTA Online.
Buying shark cards from their mom's credit card
"I grew up with the PS3 Version".
I’m a proud gta 3 baby
Society
i grew up with gta sa
What your grandkids will grow up with
GTA 4 is what I played first, didn't play it until like a year and a half before GTA 5 came out though
Remember that in the city respect is everything..... I grew up playing GTA 2 on Dreamcast and playstation 2
OG GTA, GTA 2 and GTA London here

GTA 3 was groundbreaking, VC and SA were excellent, IV was fucking trash but Lost & Damned and Ballad of Gay Tony were cool as shit, V is still awesome too.

Picked up a PS5 recently - COD Cold War was boring after first run through; downloaded GTA SA and that's all I've played for 4 weeks
I would've grown up with SA but never had anything that could play the games till a couple years ago so V is all I've known
I grew up with gta 4
I grew up with vice city
They say GTA 6 might get pushed to 2025-26 :\
Oooh man and worst part is Online gets updated frequently with dlc. While SP got hit in the face with an shovel and got pushed into an canyon..

I hope someone at Rockstar get an mental breakdown and transfer all current online dlc to sp.
He would be an legend forever
 I grew up playing SA
Support games
Except it's ExPaNdEd AnD eNhAnCeD
I started with gta 3 but I'll admit gta 4 easily has the most play time for me
I grew up with san andreas
You forgot to add "online" on the second one
GTA VC and SA. I first got GTA VC then one day I saw SA and picked up that. Love Vice City and San Andreas. Never played OG GTA III on PS2 tho
