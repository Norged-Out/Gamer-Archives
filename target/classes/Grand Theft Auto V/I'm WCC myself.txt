[[I'm WCC myself]]





West coast classics and Rock radio
    a person after my own heart
        Nothing like listening to Straight up menace and I'm Free (Heaven helps the man) while running over civilians and commenting war crimes!
            Streiht up Menace is easily my favourite song on WCC
                Agree has a story and a good beat
                    So does No more ?s, one of my personal favorites
    Same
    Man of culture
    BRING ME YOUR HIGHER LOVE!!
    i've memorised almost all of the playlist in wcc

2. first of tha month - bone thugs and harmony
3. afro puffs - lady of rage
4. the next episode - dr dre, snoop dogg
5. c-walk - kurupt
6. what you wanna do - kausion
7. sherm stick - jayo felony
8. so you wanna be a gangster - too short

RADIO
        ALL WE HEAR IS   
RADIO GAGA
            CLAP CLAP
                RADIO GAGA
                    CLAP CLAP
                        SOOOOOOOOOMEONE STILL LOVES YOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!
            ***RADIO PEEPEE***

***RADIO POOPOO***
                you just had to  
didn't you
        Yeah I sang that out loud too lol
    There's just nothing else like running people over with Kenny Loggins both singing and talking to you at the same time.
        For sure, or Blasting Danger Zone high volume in a silver Lazer jet and pretending you're Maverick from  Topgun



Oh wait that's only me. üòè
            Or whipping a chopper with fortunate someone playing
                Hahaha Fortunate Son is a great song
                    Not if you‚Äôre a rice farmer
                    Ignoring all the memes and all that, it‚Äôs actually legit a pretty good song that I find myself singing along to alot
    In my opinion the best channels
    Ah yes... A man of character
    Yes, just so much yes. I always have Los Santos Rock (...Radio!) playing in my garages and Radio Mirror Park whenever I just wanna sit back and cruise down the freeway.
Channel X or Blaine County Talk Radio when Ron is on.
    Beyond insemination is hella funny as well. The host is played by Danny McBride
        I knew he sounded familiar!
            Yeah I think that's why I find it so funny is I can picture one of his characters literally doing the things he talks about in the show lol
    Bless your heart.  "Let's just add a stick of butter"
    Oh bless your heart!!
    I love Blaine county radio. Might just be the southern blood in me though
    #AMOEBA
    Punks rise up
Don‚Äôt hate me but non stop pop
    I flip between Non-Stop Pop and WCC.  Gotta get those Weasel News breaking updates.
        Yeah these are my go-to stations as well
    It‚Äôs the best station don‚Äôt @ me.

It‚Äôs DJed by Cara Delevingne, like come on.
        No joke, I've listened to all the stations, and Cara is the only one who doesn't feel like a chore to hear through between each song. 


Every line she says is pure English banter
            I like the moderator from the low down
        TIL, thanks for that! Glad to find other like minded non stop poppers
            Ill personally be honest. I used to be a huge Radio Los Santos and West coast classics. 


Then I heard Tennis court by Lore when I was scrolling through once. 



I've never switched back
        whoa didn't know that but yea, it's my fav as well
    Finally someone else who just gets it.
        The juxtaposition of racing through Los Santos mowing people down, drive bys and killing piggies with Only Girl In The World by Rihanna playing always tickled me.
            Say what you want but the song slaps hard
            That or tennis court lol. I like the more mellow pop too.
                Ooh, tennis court is my favourite song on that station
                    I love Lorde haha
            Gimme more by Britney spears is even more funny
            The ambience on non stop pop is great, I sometimes just stop going to the objectives and drive fast up the motorways if something like bad girls or smalltown boy comes on
            Exactly you can't beat that.
            I like this station by default but listening to it while playing Trevor is the best.
    DJ Cara all day
    Not to mention you get to listen to Cara in between songs. Love that woman
    Same here. NSP, Channel X, RMP and occasionally Fly Lo.
    Hazah, a man of quality!
    Where else are we gonna find m83's midnight city, if not this.
    Same
    I want it that way by backstreet boys nuff said
    Non stop pop is full of jams!
    Cara
    I don't usually listen to pop music but non stop pop is my favorite
Los Santos Rock Radio, Non-Stop-Pop and Blue Ark
    I listen to the other two, so I must try Blue Ark as well.
        I listen to Blue Ark mainly because of ‚ÄûMoney come Money Go‚Äú. I love that song
            Gotta love Lee Scratch Perry!
        same here
    non stop pop has sone straight bangers
    Disco devil!
    Ah, I see you're a man of culture as well
    It was rather surprising to find out Cara Delevingne is the DJ for Non-Stop Pop.
    I love listening to blue ark as I fly a attack helicopter
    Aye! A man of class
    Blue Ark GOAT
    Blue ark is great stoner music
    i listen to non stop pop just bc i like the dj on it - she‚Äôs so cute and i love her accent
Radio Mirror Park all day long
    Polish girl just slaps a little harder when you are speeding down the freeways of Los Santos.
        ITS BEEN AT LEAST ANOTHER YEAR AND STILL I HAVENT GOT THE CHANCE TO SAYY
    [deleted]
        Excuse the soundcloud link but: https://soundcloud.com/furtheram-10/grand-theft-auto-v-gta-5-radio here‚Äôs the recording for RMP
    That station is how I found Battle Tapes and they're my favorite band of all time. 

Y'all gotta listen to Graveyard Shift it will change how you see colors.
    I was literally going to say those exact same words.
    Hipster.. jk I like that station too
    Sleepwalking hits different at night in gta
Lowdown
    You know we straight doin ur mom
        Is that rwj reference?
    They need to put more songs on there
    So relaxing.
    Was looking for this
    I can't believe I had to scroll this far down to find The Lowdown. The Lowdown all day.
    Driving around listening to Cruisin is so relaxing
    Lowdown is SO FUCKIN GOOD
    I like the funky vibe
none, i have my spotify blaring in my ears
    Thought I was the only one! I even made a playlist just for gta!
        You mind sharing? I imagine a gta Playlist could be pretty badass
            Yeah no problem. Basically it's xxxtentacion, lil uzi vert, lil peep artists like that.

Here's a link https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNy6i3wH1sbd6QNKRzyRKZTDddHr-pPno
                Man got downvoted for sharing his personal taste in music smh
                    So I noticed lmao
                        Upvoted for you
                            Soo is he gonna share it
                                Sorry it took me so long to respond guys. I use Youtube music as that's my personal preference so here's a link to my playlist https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNy6i3wH1sbd6QNKRzyRKZTDddHr-pPno
                    Reddit absolutely hates those 3 artist or genre of music .

Then you go to what‚Äôs your favourite music threads or someshit and the top posts always like nirvana or some band that literally everybody knows. 

I love X , lil uzi and peep
                    Actually rude
                U can put it in the game files somewhere and it should appear in a custom radio station
                    [removed]
                        On ps4 it's easy af. You basically install Spotify on the ps4, log into your account and play the prefered playlist. Granted, it wont stop when leaving the vehicle but you can pause it whenever you want.
                    seriously?!?!
                        Google it i remember doing it
    You can put music in your gta game and it‚Äôll play on a custom radio station
Rebel radio

    Ya gotta get wit iiitt
Blonded is the best radio station
    Frank Ocean songs are amazing for cruising in downtown LS at night
        Dude the frank ocean songs are great
            I need a station purely for Frank Ocean. Driving down the streets and highways of GTA V deserve a station dedicated to Frank.
        Every night fucks every day
Every day patches the night up
    I heard a Jay Z song on there once. Never heard it again after that. So weird.
        I think I heard a Tyler the creator song on that station once also but never heard it again.
            It was flylo fm for sure. Garbage by tyler the creator
    Don‚Äôt you just hate when you go to the ground and pound and they don‚Äôt have your smoothie latte, so you gotta chop the waiters hand off.

That part is hilarious.
        Don't you just hate when you bite into an avocado, and it's still a bit hard, so you unload an entire clip into a nearby ambulance?
            don‚Äôt you hate it when you‚Äôre tryna steal a guys whip and he resists and you have to unload a whole clip in his head
    You sir, are goated
    That Marvin Gaye hit different when you've been doing special races all night
        Especially, when they talk about, how you listen to Chris Manfield song, and don't want to kill anybody, and then this track, and they like "Shit, gotta do something"
    This station inspired my username
    Yesss finally scrolling forever to look for this comment, I was gonna be sad if I didn‚Äôt see itüòÇ
Vinewood Boulevard!!! Respect the classics, man!!!
    Best DJs too
        There are a couple breaks where they're talking and start laughing and I can't help but think they had an absolute blast scoring that gig. A buddy of mine saw Wavves live and apparently they wrote "Nine Is God" for the game
            Nine Is God is the best song in the game nothing can change my mind
    Why did I have to scroll so low to see this!? Best station around
    Big shout-out to VBR for introducing me to FIDLAR, those guys are awesome.
Gabriiiiiieeeeelllllllllll
    *Now you've gone too far* ( Õ°o Õú ñ Õ°o)

Blonded ,ifruit,and radio los santos or just spotify
    I had to scroll this long for a person that has the same opinion as me
    Honestly thought these were the only 3 radios people actually listened to, till I came across this comment section
Soul wax and non stop pop all day every say
    You are listening to Soulwax FM, the station with the newest and hottest tracks
        LS rock radio, non-stop and west coast radio
I know i know pretty diverse
            CAPTAIN LOGGINS
    Fucking thank god I wasnt the only one. I scrolled for so long to find someone else <3
    Ss Oo Uu Ll Ww Aa Xx

Calm down Los Santos...
Space mothertrucker
    Hell yeah funk it up my dude
        Ayyyyy ‚úåüòî
    *i said the motha ship connection babeh*
        Alright! star child!
    Bootsy is the best radio host
    Getting my groove on mother funker
    Underrated radio station
    Oh yeah. Get some of that funky Space 103.2-bop!
    Space + the low down are my go to. I‚Äôm big into funk and soul, so those stations hit it.
    If you‚Äôve got an Apple Music subscription there‚Äôs an official Space 103.2 playlist up there. I‚Äôm sure all the stations have one but I only care about Space lol
    Easily the best jams in the entire game on this station. Grooves so funky they make you wanna ADADADAD and wiggle youre car as you drive to the waypoint.
    Even though I‚Äôm 2 years late, I‚Äôm so glad I found at least one person who appreciates Space, gotta love bootsy
EAST LOS FM!!!!!

Real gangstas listen to Non stop pop
    Coz they don't wanna stand there looking constipated
Who isn‚Äôt WCC honestly
    I can‚Äôt disagree with you
        Or LSRR
Self radio
    The most narcissistic music
    Too far down

Best radio station let‚Äôs go
WCC or FlyLo interchangeably
    Last night when you were all asleep i replaced your memory artificially
    FlyLo all the way. Brainfeed me upppp
    FlyLo always has the best driving music, and those songs have top notch beats. Smoke a joint, go cruising around the map, and turn the radio up. The closest to becoming one with GTA as you can get imo.
    Your music sounds like a dumpster rolling down five flights of stairs
        *dumpster on üî• rolling down five flights of stairs. 

And i love it that way üòÅ
        um this is Tyler my song don‚Äôt have a cool intro so it‚Äôs gonna come in right now hello
            I‚Äôm a salesman sorta giant, I sell Molly and Mary and other various items...
    ‚ÄúIf you dont listen to flylo, then you is a BITCH ASS mother fucka!‚Äù

Ftfy
    Brother!
    Flylo played tyler the creator and shit right? That shit was hype
Los Santos Rock Radio. Because you ALL know when you hear that bass drum comin' in hard, and that wailing guitar opening to Rain by The Cult, that you're about to have a good drive. Also... "Were running with the shadows of the night..."

Pat Benetar can do no wrong. Don't @ me.
    In the burning heart... Just about to burst
    I adore Lonely is the night.
Radio Los Santos or channel X
Soulwax with a side of mirror park
Gaaabbriiieeellll
    100%, usually on my penny farthing
Chanel x
VBR, West coast classics and blue ark
Real men listen to Radio Mirror Park
    You misspelled hipsters
Vine wood boulevard radio

Obviously Rebel radio the superior channel
FLYLO FM & West coast Classics

Non-stop pop then when misteeq scandalous comes on it's a damn partyü§£

YouTube

Forgot what the old radio wheel looks like lol. I mix it up and listen to everything but rebel radio. Fuck country lol
That's easy... West coast classics of course
West Coast Classics
West Coast Talk Radio. Dr. Ray D'Angelo Harris is an amazing talkshow host.
Wait where the fuck is ifruit radio
Usually the bottom middle
WCC is the answer here. Whatever the channel is for the insane talk radio is pretty funny to break it up every once in a while. 

&#x200B;

Also, when I go to trailer park ville, I listen to Rebel Radio. It just feels right.
Finally a WCCer
West Coast Classic, Non Stop POP, LS Rock Radio, and Ifruit radio
West coast classics and non stop pop for me
I think they should have an oldschool radio for the east coast maybe
    I love that idea and even thought about it myself. It‚Äôd be great to hear tracks like Ain‚Äôt No Half Stepping, the Ten Crack Commandments and It Ain‚Äôt Hard To Tell while in GTA V.

I think the reason why there‚Äôs no station for this or why there won‚Äôt be a station like this is because Los Santos is in California and it wouldn‚Äôt make much sense to have EC tracks in a WC area. It sucks but there you go.
Rock radio non stop pop west coast classic and radio los santos
West Coast
West Coast Classic
Looking at the replies, it's so amazing that Rockstar has always thrived to cater everyone's taste in music
Is it bad that I have music turned off?

West coast classics
West coast classics, rock radio, and rebel radio
Depends on the character.
LSRR for Michael.
Channel X for Trevor.
WCC or RLS for Franklin.
Channel X all the way, sometimes Rock radio
The one with Radio Gaga
West coast classics
Non-stop pop, rock radio, sometimes rebel radio, but the all time number one radio stations is radio off.
Rebel radio makes me giggle pretty often
Blonded all day
West Coast Classics cause they always play the bangers
I'm quite a mixed bag tbh, depends on my mood I guess - could be listening to any of:
- Radio Mirror Park
- Los Santos Rock Radio
- Non Stop Pop
- Radio Los Santos
Self Radio
Apparently there is an apple music station? It played Da baby and some other commercial hip-hop I was surprised
Ah man am I the only Lowdown fan here?

LS rock and WCC are my next picks.
Anyone else have a different station for each character?
Fly Lo all day
Rebel radio never misses
Los Santos Rock Radio, Rebel Radio, and East Lost Santos FM
Non-stop Pop, Los Santos Rock Radio, Soulwax FM and occasionally West Coast classics. Soulwax remixes are bangers, the classic rock and Kenny Loggins as DJ is absolutely excellent, and most of the classic rap songs are great bangers too.
That one with the sexy english chick talking about ice cream enemas
blonded. all the way.
My parents used to hate it when there was swearing in my video games so I could only listen to blue ark for a while. Kinda grew on me.
I like to mix it up because all the djs and radio host are fucking nuts and I like to hear what they have to say
I turn that shit off and listen to the screams and profanities of the Los Santos citizens and police
Can‚Äôt believe nobody is saying blonded....
Rebel radio. When country wasn‚Äôt for pussies.
LS Rock Radio. They have Roundabout there and I love trying to escape 4 stars while acting like I'm in a JoJo episode.
Soulwax any day
Am I the only Rebel Radio fan?
Off. My mom was really skeptical about the appropriateness of this game for me as a kid/teen and only allowed it bc I always played with the sound off. üòÇ
Ifruit gang where yall at??
i'll come clean, after i listened to all the talk radio stations, its been non-stop pop ever since baby.
The talk radio is hilarious
LSRR all the way. 

But the real question is - would you rather die on the 20-foot yacht with a 20-year old or on a 80-foot yacht with a 80-year old?
Whichever plays Radio Ga Ga
The hood gon' love it
Rebel Radio
Channel X

Don't need the rest
Los Santos Rock Radio
Los santos rock radio
Los Santos Rock Radio and West Coast Classics is where it‚Äôs at
The screaming pleas of my victims.
*Laughs in Self Radio*
The soundtracks and radio stations are just always so good in the games. I remember GTAIV playing Flashing Lights by Kanye, and afterward, the DJ says ‚Äúand we're gonna play it over and over and over again!‚Äù to mock how much the song was actually overplayed in real life.
[removed]
Rebel Radio and Channel X for me
Chakra attack baby
Implemented my own songs into the song folder on PC, but on console I always listened to West coast classics / rock radio
West coast classics üòå but unfortunately my bf uninstalled the game so he could have room for call of duty smh
Only west coast classics and nothing else
Self radio (please look it up it will make your gta experience so much better) but before that it was mirror park radio, rock radio and pop radio
Porn
I‚Äôm more of a lowdown fella myself
I used to bang out WCC but I‚Äôm tired of those songs so I listen to ifruit radio losSantos and weirdly nonstop pop
Blonded
Either Los Santos Rock Radio or West Coast Classics
West coast classics
None of them after hearing them so much, I prefer launching golden age hip hop playlists on spotify before I boot the game up
blonded is my fav love frank ocean <3
Los santos rock radio for life!!!
a person after my own heart
    Nothing like listening to Straight up menace and I'm Free (Heaven helps the man) while running over civilians and commenting war crimes!
        Streiht up Menace is easily my favourite song on WCC
            Agree has a story and a good beat
                So does No more ?s, one of my personal favorites
Same
Man of culture
BRING ME YOUR HIGHER LOVE!!
i've memorised almost all of the playlist in wcc
1. bow down - wsc
2. first of tha month - bone thugs and harmony
3. afro puffs - lady of rage
4. the next episode - dr dre, snoop dogg
5. c-walk - kurupt
6. what you wanna do - kausion
7. sherm stick - jayo felony
8. so you wanna be a gangster - too short
9. no more ?s - eazy e
10. gangsta gansta - nwa
11. captain save a hoe - (i forgot)

i also occasionally listen to LS Rock for Roundabout
Same

***RADIO POOPOO***
            you just had to  
didn't you
    Yeah I sang that out loud too lol
There's just nothing else like running people over with Kenny Loggins both singing and talking to you at the same time.
    For sure, or Blasting Danger Zone high volume in a silver Lazer jet and pretending you're Maverick from  Topgun



Oh wait that's only me. üòè
        Or whipping a chopper with fortunate someone playing
            Hahaha Fortunate Son is a great song
                Not if you‚Äôre a rice farmer
                Ignoring all the memes and all that, it‚Äôs actually legit a pretty good song that I find myself singing along to alot
In my opinion the best channels
Ah yes... A man of character
Yes, just so much yes. I always have Los Santos Rock (...Radio!) playing in my garages and Radio Mirror Park whenever I just wanna sit back and cruise down the freeway.
Beyond insemination is hella funny as well. The host is played by Danny McBride
    I knew he sounded familiar!
        Yeah I think that's why I find it so funny is I can picture one of his characters literally doing the things he talks about in the show lol
Bless your heart.  "Let's just add a stick of butter"
Oh bless your heart!!
I love Blaine county radio. Might just be the southern blood in me though
#AMOEBA
Punks rise up
I flip between Non-Stop Pop and WCC.  Gotta get those Weasel News breaking updates.
    Yeah these are my go-to stations as well
It‚Äôs the best station don‚Äôt @ me.

It‚Äôs DJed by Cara Delevingne, like come on.
    No joke, I've listened to all the stations, and Cara is the only one who doesn't feel like a chore to hear through between each song. 


Every line she says is pure English banter
        I like the moderator from the low down
    TIL, thanks for that! Glad to find other like minded non stop poppers
        Ill personally be honest. I used to be a huge Radio Los Santos and West coast classics. 


Then I heard Tennis court by Lore when I was scrolling through once. 



I've never switched back
    whoa didn't know that but yea, it's my fav as well
Finally someone else who just gets it.
    The juxtaposition of racing through Los Santos mowing people down, drive bys and killing piggies with Only Girl In The World by Rihanna playing always tickled me.
        Say what you want but the song slaps hard
        That or tennis court lol. I like the more mellow pop too.
            Ooh, tennis court is my favourite song on that station
                I love Lorde haha
        Gimme more by Britney spears is even more funny
        The ambience on non stop pop is great, I sometimes just stop going to the objectives and drive fast up the motorways if something like bad girls or smalltown boy comes on
        Exactly you can't beat that.
        I like this station by default but listening to it while playing Trevor is the best.
DJ Cara all day
Not to mention you get to listen to Cara in between songs. Love that woman
Same here. NSP, Channel X, RMP and occasionally Fly Lo.
Hazah, a man of quality!
Where else are we gonna find m83's midnight city, if not this.
Same
I want it that way by backstreet boys nuff said
Non stop pop is full of jams!
Cara
I don't usually listen to pop music but non stop pop is my favorite
I listen to the other two, so I must try Blue Ark as well.
    I listen to Blue Ark mainly because of ‚ÄûMoney come Money Go‚Äú. I love that song
        Gotta love Lee Scratch Perry!
    same here
non stop pop has sone straight bangers
Disco devil!
Ah, I see you're a man of culture as well
It was rather surprising to find out Cara Delevingne is the DJ for Non-Stop Pop.
I love listening to blue ark as I fly a attack helicopter
Aye! A man of class
Blue Ark GOAT
Blue ark is great stoner music
i listen to non stop pop just bc i like the dj on it - she‚Äôs so cute and i love her accent
Polish girl just slaps a little harder when you are speeding down the freeways of Los Santos.

    Excuse the soundcloud link but: https://soundcloud.com/furtheram-10/grand-theft-auto-v-gta-5-radio here‚Äôs the recording for RMP
That station is how I found Battle Tapes and they're my favorite band of all time. 

Y'all gotta listen to Graveyard Shift it will change how you see colors.
I was literally going to say those exact same words.
Hipster.. jk I like that station too
Sleepwalking hits different at night in gta

They need to put more songs on there
So relaxing.
Was looking for this
I can't believe I had to scroll this far down to find The Lowdown. The Lowdown all day.
Driving around listening to Cruisin is so relaxing
Lowdown is SO FUCKIN GOOD
I like the funky vibe
Thought I was the only one! I even made a playlist just for gta!
    You mind sharing? I imagine a gta Playlist could be pretty badass
        Yeah no problem. Basically it's xxxtentacion, lil uzi vert, lil peep artists like that.

Here's a link https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNy6i3wH1sbd6QNKRzyRKZTDddHr-pPno
            Man got downvoted for sharing his personal taste in music smh

Then you go to what‚Äôs your favourite music threads or someshit and the top posts always like nirvana or some band that literally everybody knows. 

I love X , lil uzi and peep
                Actually rude
            U can put it in the game files somewhere and it should appear in a custom radio station
                [removed]
                    On ps4 it's easy af. You basically install Spotify on the ps4, log into your account and play the prefered playlist. Granted, it wont stop when leaving the vehicle but you can pause it whenever you want.
                seriously?!?!
                    Google it i remember doing it

Frank Ocean songs are amazing for cruising in downtown LS at night
    Dude the frank ocean songs are great
        I need a station purely for Frank Ocean. Driving down the streets and highways of GTA V deserve a station dedicated to Frank.
    Every night fucks every day
Every day patches the night up
I heard a Jay Z song on there once. Never heard it again after that. So weird.
    I think I heard a Tyler the creator song on that station once also but never heard it again.
        It was flylo fm for sure. Garbage by tyler the creator
Don‚Äôt you just hate when you go to the ground and pound and they don‚Äôt have your smoothie latte, so you gotta chop the waiters hand off.

That part is hilarious.
    Don't you just hate when you bite into an avocado, and it's still a bit hard, so you unload an entire clip into a nearby ambulance?
        don‚Äôt you hate it when you‚Äôre tryna steal a guys whip and he resists and you have to unload a whole clip in his head
You sir, are goated
That Marvin Gaye hit different when you've been doing special races all night
    Especially, when they talk about, how you listen to Chris Manfield song, and don't want to kill anybody, and then this track, and they like "Shit, gotta do something"
This station inspired my username
Yesss finally scrolling forever to look for this comment, I was gonna be sad if I didn‚Äôt see itüòÇ
Best DJs too
    There are a couple breaks where they're talking and start laughing and I can't help but think they had an absolute blast scoring that gig. A buddy of mine saw Wavves live and apparently they wrote "Nine Is God" for the game
        Nine Is God is the best song in the game nothing can change my mind
Why did I have to scroll so low to see this!? Best station around
Big shout-out to VBR for introducing me to FIDLAR, those guys are awesome.
*Now you've gone too far* ( Õ°o Õú ñ Õ°o)
Calm dow los santos, don't panic, relax, relax, relax

I had to scroll this long for a person that has the same opinion as me
Honestly thought these were the only 3 radios people actually listened to, till I came across this comment section
You are listening to Soulwax FM, the station with the newest and hottest tracks
    LS rock radio, non-stop and west coast radio
I know i know pretty diverse

Getting my groove on mother funker
Underrated radio station
Oh yeah. Get some of that funky Space 103.2-bop!
Space + the low down are my go to. I‚Äôm big into funk and soul, so those stations hit it.
If you‚Äôve got an Apple Music subscription there‚Äôs an official Space 103.2 playlist up there. I‚Äôm sure all the stations have one but I only care about Space lol
Easily the best jams in the entire game on this station. Grooves so funky they make you wanna ADADADAD and wiggle youre car as you drive to the waypoint.
Even though I‚Äôm 2 years late, I‚Äôm so glad I found at least one person who appreciates Space, gotta love bootsy

Too far down

Best radio station let‚Äôs go
Last night when you were all asleep i replaced your memory artificially
FlyLo all the way. Brainfeed me upppp
FlyLo always has the best driving music, and those songs have top notch beats. Smoke a joint, go cruising around the map, and turn the radio up. The closest to becoming one with GTA as you can get imo.
Your music sounds like a dumpster rolling down five flights of stairs
    *dumpster on üî• rolling down five flights of stairs.

    um this is Tyler my song don‚Äôt have a cool intro so it‚Äôs gonna come in right now hello

Non stop pop has the best RJ in my opinion.
Hmm. Never tried that.
Nothing beats doing a heist on GTA Online while your speakers are blasting some LSUR
Thats‚Äôs a very good radio station
I love that idea and even thought about it myself. It‚Äôd be great to hear tracks like Ain‚Äôt No Half Stepping, the Ten Crack Commandments and It Ain‚Äôt Hard To Tell while in GTA V.

I think the reason why there‚Äôs no station for this or why there won‚Äôt be a station like this is because Los Santos is in California and it wouldn‚Äôt make much sense to have EC tracks in a WC area. It sucks but there you go.
Nothing like listening to Straight up menace and I'm Free (Heaven helps the man) while running over civilians and commenting war crimes!
    Streiht up Menace is easily my favourite song on WCC

Yeah I think that's why I find it so funny is I can picture one of his characters literally doing the things he talks about in the show lol

Ill personally be honest. I used to be a huge Radio Los Santos and West coast classics. 


Then I heard Tennis court by Lore when I was scrolling through once. 



I've never switched back
Say what you want but the song slaps hard
That or tennis court lol. I like the more mellow pop too.
    Ooh, tennis court is my favourite song on that station
        I love Lorde haha
Gimme more by Britney spears is even more funny
The ambience on non stop pop is great, I sometimes just stop going to the objectives and drive fast up the motorways if something like bad girls or smalltown boy comes on
Exactly you can't beat that.
I like this station by default but listening to it while playing Trevor is the best.
Gotta love Lee Scratch Perry!
Yeah no problem. Basically it's xxxtentacion, lil uzi vert, lil peep artists like that.
