[[I was NOT expecting to like Halo Reach this much.]]


Heyo, before starting this I'd like to say that I have basically 0 experience with Halo. The reason for that is that I'm 18 years old, meaning when I was old enough to actually enjoy games, Halo was well over its peak. Besides that, Xbox, and therefore Halo, was never very popular here in Brazil. With that said, I have played Halo CE about 3 times, back when I pirated games, and almost finished it again when I bought it on MCC.

Recently however, the entire collection went on sale, and I decided to buy everything, and play them in chronological order, starting with Halo Reach. And my god, it was actually fantastic. Few FPS games have made me feel as much dread as this games' campaign, and it was all top notch. The gunplay, the enemy variety, visual style, and the OST, oh god, the OST. All of it felt on point.

The game is very light on plot: You control the spartan Noble Six, part of the Noble squad, while trying to combat an invasion on planet colony Reach. But it has an amazing cast of characters. At first I thought they were kinda generic, but after the halfway mark it really hit me the point the game is trying to make: You're not important. Your squad isn't some legendary well-known team. All you are is a soldier with a mission. And this served to intensify the dread, and overall tone of the game.

Overall, I recommend for everyone who enjoy singleplayer experiences, and some good shooting.


I remember when Halo: Reach launched a lot of fans didn't like it but it got great reviews and critics felt like it was a great sendoff for Bungie. I know lot of people have turned around on it because it is a good game with a good story and good multiplayer. Besides some small lore changes, I think it is a really fun game especially the last few missions.
    Reach was extremely divisive.

It's campaign is very widely beloved and considered in the running for best in the series, but a lot of hard-core fans at the time were upset because it retconned large parts of The Fall of Reach, a widely beloved novel.

With the multiplayer, I think Reach has the best online suite of any arena shooter to date. The sheer variety of gamemodes available in Reach is unmatched.

On the other hand, Reach multiplayer had some pretty profound balancing issues. Weapon bloom is probably the most talked about, but you can really see it in the armor abilities. Abilities like hologram were cool but very rarely picked because of how much worse they were. On the other hand, armor lock was extremely overpowered, used by everyone, and not really fun to play against, since it boils down to giving every player the ability to stall their opponents out for 5 seconds before they die.
        I was in college when Reach released. Me and my friends grew up playing CE, 2, and 3 together - it's basically all we played in high school.

We *really* disliked Reach due to the armor abilities, particularly armor lock because people would activate it right before you killed them in a gun fight, and then you'd get cleaned up by their teammate or some other opponent before your shields regenerated. Basically a get out of jail free card.

Particular disliked the jetpacks as well... they completely negated any kind of map control and balance. Playing capture the flag, wipe their whole team, pick up the flag and start headed towards base? Well, they'll just spawn, jetpack 100 feet up in the air, and ding you with the DMR.

Reach definitely grew on me, especially now days, but we were super unhappy with it around the time it launched. With the armor abilities and loadouts, barely felt like Halo anymore, so we were always going back to 2 and 3 instead of playing Reach. It didn't feel balanced, and thought armor abilities were a cop out for the not so good players to have a better chance.

edit// it also released with not very many maps, and almost half of which were forge maps.
        I remember a lot of people disliking the changes from Fall of Reach, but I remember a lot of people I knew personally hating the new gamemodes along with the balancing issues. Things have clearly turned around on the game but I remember a lot of people hating on the game at the time.
    Reach was when the Halo community started to say Halo is dead. And now it's a very beloved game. This community is the worst, it's always current game bad, previous game awesome.
        Nah, since 343 inherited the series it‚Äôs not been great. I was a massive fan but I just don‚Äôt like how 343 has handled the series at all. 

Don‚Äôt generalise an entire fan base lol. I loved reach at launch ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è as per usual the vocal minority is the loudest.
            > Don‚Äôt generalise an entire fan base lol.

reddit is good at doing this.

>as per usual the vocal minority is the loudest.

and bad at acknowledging this.

Oh wow
                    Honestly Reddit‚Äôs so full of contrary opinions from everyone it can be hard to take sometimes. People come out of nowhere to disagree just to disagree sometimes! I‚Äôve had people argue with me over things like work health and safety, when my job was being a health and safety officer at the last warehouse I was in‚Ä¶it can be really fucking exhausting lol. 

But yeh generalising everyone is not the best move. Everyone‚Äôs different ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è it‚Äôs what makes us all human!
                        Let's not pretend that groupthink isn't a thing though. It's a highly documented phenomenon in psychology and is very prevalent in larger communities of people. People will slowly adopt whatever opinion it mindset they see as the "safe" one due to a desire to "fit in."

You can argue that individuals all have different opinions but when in large groups, opinions tend to coalesce.
                            Explains the online phenomenon then I‚Äôd say. Most large groups online end up as echo chambers.
                    That‚Äôs like saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not racist but‚Äù and then speaking about hating certain stereotypes or generalisations of a race
                There's so much irony in this statement it hurts
            Piggybacking to point out that in Halo MCC on PC, both Halo 1 and 2‚Äôs co-op campaigns are unplayable due to bugs that cause crashes and disconnects. For me, they are the highlight of the series, and not being able to play them with my Player 2 made me completely regret my purchase.

This comes down to 343 not giving a shit
                worked fine for me and my friend, though I heard the same about the console version, no?
I think I played it with a friend when it launched on Steam.

Is that a larger problem for the pc port, or have you gotten unlucky? Still bad if it doesn't work for you anyway.
                    Co op is completely unplayable on pc for me and my brother. We haven‚Äôt gotten any crashes but it needs to re sync every half a minute or so
                        It's always worked fine for me on pc and I've done at least 10 play throughs of each game with a variety of people.
                The mcc is a disgrace. Took it ages to be able to play it solo even. 343 have fucked the series hard.
                Halo 2 is still broken, but 1 works great.
                    I wish it worked for me :/
                I've literally played every MCC game in coop with someone half a country away. The only issue we had was slight input lag. Never any crashes or bugs.
        Reach did change up the formula for multiplayer quite a bit by being the game that introduced armor abilities.

To be fair to the critics, that was *quite* a shakeup compared to 1-3 in changing up the multiplayer dynamic.
            And sick as fucking hell assassinations.
                I agree that they look sick as hell. But I prefer when you didn't have control of your character taken away and moved to a 3rd person cut scene.
                    It‚Äôs an integral part of what made me love it   The game froze to gaze upon my cool as fuck sneaky murder.
        The Pokemon community has been the same way for a while. Gets tiring after a while.
            They are right, tough.

Especially when community made Pok√©mon games have easily overtaken the main games in quality for years now.
        > This community is the worst, it's always current game bad, previous game awesome.

Isn't that all video game communities ever?
        Very true, they have a habit of doing that. That was just the first time I remember people I knew in school saying it besides just strangers online.
         Many communities are like that. Just human nature
        Hahaha if only we knew back then what was about to happen 2 years later lol
        Usually in any series, the second game made is great and then they start a steady decline. Not every game mind you, but so many IPs have lived and died this way.

Capitalism means that executives require a game to become more and more mainstream. This tends to lead to a lifecycle of the first game being fairly niche, the second being a sweet balance, and the third going too far.

Some examples include. Lost Planet and Dead Space. You can include Battlefield now too, though it‚Äôs decline has been far more slow until reaching 2042 levels.

Basically my point is, very very often, continuous games in an IP genuinely continue to be worse, watered down, or less indepth than the previous game - thus explaining your ‚Äúpeople always say the previous game was good, current game bad‚Äù scenario. When something new comes out that is worse, it also in context makes the previous game *look* better, and makes people appreciate the good.
Ready? READY DOESN‚ÄôT EVEN‚Ä¶FUCKING‚Ä¶ DESCRIBE IT!!!
you should play odst. you'll love it
    I will, right after 3 :)
        Since you said your doing it chronologically, ODST actually takes place between 2 and 3.
            oohhhh, ok, didn't know about that
                Yeah, ODST starts during a mission of 2. It really only had 3 in the title because it used 3's engine since it was the most recent game at the time.
                    makes sense. Thanks for the info!
                Just play them in the order they released. It's how Bungie intended for them to be played.
    The soundtrack is just sublime.
    ODST and Reach are my favorite games in the series, followed VERY closely by 3 and 1. I love the Chief, but they breathed so much life into the world.
    ODST is the best halo campaign, period
I think I've said this before on another reddit post, but the final mission "lone wolf" is one of my favourite examples of gaming as an artistic medium. It's a perfect little vignette showing the enduring desire for humans to want to live, despite their situation. 

As the player, we already know that our character dies, and playing the level is ultimately pointless. But how many of us tried to live as long as possible? The end was the same as if you had just left your controller on your lap, and you know that, but I can guarantee that almost everyone still tries to survive and fight against the inevitable...
I absolutely love Reach, its my second favorite Halo game after CE. I've seen a lot of criticism targeted at the characters and their lack of development. But in my opinion, Reach is a masterclass in restraint, or doing "just enough." The story is very simple, but that underscores its powerful theme of sacrifice without glory. Each member of Noble team gets just enough characterization to feel like real people. From what we learn about Carter or Jorge, we can infer a lot about them and create our own understanding/story for their character. The dialogue is excellent too, its somber and to the point but also throws in a healthy amount of banter to humanize the squad without ever getting into cheesy action movie territory. Both the art direction and the score are impeccable, probably the best of any Halo game imo, and set pieces never overstay their welcome. There is always something unique and captivating to look at while you play this game. All of this and more contribute to an amazing experience with tight gameplay, a succinct but powerful story, and some of the best atmosphere/tone out there. Honestly, I would consider the game to be pretty much perfect. The combat challenge is also the best in the series barring CE. My only complaint is that the Sabre part of Long Night of Solace is horribly balanced on legendary.
    I've never understood the complaint about the characters not feeling fleshed out.
Reach was the best Halo, but CE will forever have a special place in my heart.  For the time it came out, CE was the best FPS hands down.
    Replaying the campaign recently and tbh it still holds up. The score, the level design, the simpler plot compared to the rest. 10/10.
        There is no way I'm giving Halo 1 campaign a 10/10 when it has The Library level

That is literally the worst level I've ever played in a AAA shooter campaign
            The first half of Halo CE's campaign is 9/10 - 10/10 territory.

The second half... well.
            To each their own but I really did dig the levels of flood. It wasn't a standout by any means but still I'd put it above most other FPS levels Ive played.
                I just got done playing CE for the first time last week and had no idea that it had the genre flip. Was 100% not expecting a zombie shooter, and loved that there was suddenly now a third team on the battlefield. Remastered graphics ruined it a bit by being so bright, but it was nice to have them easily switched between when I got annoyed with the darkness past the point of fun.
            I agree. Assault on the Control Room is 50% just the same corridors and rooms with slightly different layouts, and then Two Betrayals is basically Assault on the Control Room but in reverse. 

The Library is essentially the same semicircle level stacked on itself three times. 

You could also argue that the first Flood level that starts in the swamp is just copy pasted rooms for the entirety of the interior section.  

Pillar of Autumn through to Silent Cartographer are top tier, but everything from there until the final level are....not good. Even then you could argue that The Maw is just the first level with a different texture kit.
        I tried halo CE recently and got like halfway through but never finished. It felt too old for my taste, the controls and graphics were clunky and some rooms were really frustrating. Enjoyed Halo Reach a lot though
            Halo Reach was a fantastic game, really enjoyed the campaign there too and will fully admit to having a huge bias towards CE given Ive been playing since release and have only fond memories with my buddies lol.
Totally, it‚Äôs my favourite of the franchise. Never got the chance to dig into CE and 2 but I loved Halo 3. Reach is where I started and I just couldn‚Äôt put it down. Plus at the time, the multiplayer was excellent and a ton of fun, and the forge mode has a huge map to mess around with. It was great when I was young and all my friends would stage big battles on there and people made huge racecourses you could do with the mongoose and warthog. Good times.
    >Never got the chance to dig into CE

Campaign-wise its head and shoulders above the rest imo. Really recommend a playthrough if only to experience iconic levels like Assault on the Control Room, Two Betrayals, and Silent Cartographer. Also Halo is fantastic. And The Maw.

Its really just bangers start to finish.
        Yeah it‚Äôs always been something I‚Äôve meant to go back to for sure! Just never really had the facilities as I only have PlayStation now. One day!
        Okay, I love CE, but the level design is not as good as I remember. I know they were working with limited resources, but damn if it isn't annoying walking through the same room 15 times with the only change being a different enemy type. It detracts away from the game quite a bit for me. Similarly, halo 2 uses quite a few hoard sections where you can't move ahead untill you kill a few wave of enemies. Those are also a bit annoying. Though I think halo 2's writing more than makes up for it.  Also, in CE you can just tell that they didn't have plans for the series to go on. Writing wasn't preparing for a full saga like halo 2 and 3. The combat is very good for its age though.
            Agreed. Assault on the Control Room is basically 50% the same interior corridors and room over and over with slightly different layouts. 

And then Two Betrayals is almost a 1:1 copy of AotCR, just in reverse now. 

Also The Library is not good level design either. It's basically the same corridor stacked on itself three times. 

50% of CE is great level design. The other 50% is quite poor level design.
I really liked Halo Reach, as controversial as Halo 5‚Äôs campaign was especially with Master Chief feeling like an afterthought it was really refreshing to have a different story and different characters for Reach just like ODST did, instead of just playing as Master Chief.

I think it was the perfect swan song for Bungie Halo.
The most patient gamer of all time
I really enjoyed this too. Played it on PC as part of the MCC and liked it overall more than the remake of Halo 1. I like story focused shooters with character and I feel like this delivered.
The story in Reach is the only good one.  The epilogue in particular is the best I've played, where even as I played it and knew there was no surviving, I still fought to the end and was actually startled when he took his helmet.
    #CURRENT OBJECTIVE: SURVIVE
        That never hit me quite as hard as the chapter title ‚ÄúThere‚Äôll be another time‚Ä¶‚Äù
            "Lieutenant, get aboard! We've gotta get the hell out of here!"

"Negative. I have the gun. Good luck, sir."
Reach was one of my favorite fps games on xbox 360. The campaign was good, multiplayer was good and music was good. 

I wonder if i would like it as much as i did if i bought it now on pc to replay it.
May as well ask here:

  


I also bought the MCC during the recent sale, and wanted to play my way through the saga (I had played maybe half of CE's campaign back in the day, and watched most of Red v Blue, but am otherwise completely in the dark regarding Halo's plot).

  


I wanted to play the games in release order (meaning, CE first) but saw the collection suggests a "chronological" approach (with Reach as the first game). Is there any pro/con to either way? Will I spoil the later games if I play Reach first (like, I will get used to gameplay comforts, graphics, etc, that are not there in the older CE)? Would I spoil the experience of the plot if I play Reach first (not necessarily story spoilers, but rather Reach being less impactful because Im missing references, or CE being less impactful because I would have previous knowledge of twists and such)?

EDIT: Thanks for the replies/suggestions. I think I'll stick to playing in release order to see how the gameplay evolves.
    I'd play in release order. It's a little more cohesive because of how drastic the gameplay and graphics change.
        Yeah I think Ill go for it this way
    It‚Äôs been years since I played through them but The only thing I can think of is if you started with reach you might not get some of the references with regards to the scientist woman. I can‚Äôt remember her name at the moment. There are a couple interactions where some context of knowing more about her would make things more meaningful or clear. 

Honestly though I had also read some halo books so it‚Äôs hard to say if some of context I‚Äôm talking about came from those vs the main games. 

Regardless, reach would not be confusing at all. They explain what they need to in the game but there might be some nuances you‚Äôd miss
    >Will I spoil the later games if I play Reach first (like, I will get used to gameplay comforts, graphics, etc, that are not there in the older CE)?

None of the story will be spoiled. Halo reach end right before the story in halo ce and is about the stuff happening on planet reach (which i think gets a slight mention in ce). The biggest con imo is the worse graphics and more dated controls/combat. You will also spend most of your time in ce alone without allies. 

I recommend playing the games in release order (you can skip odst if you arent a fan of playing a spinoff). You are new to halo so just follow the release order. 

If you dont like halo ce (i didn't), you can just skip it. You can watch a story summary if you decide to skip it. Halo 2 and 3 are much better in almost everything.
    do you prefer to see the story in order, or do you prefer to see the mechanics evolve with each game? I think that's what you should be considering
    Play in release order. That's how most people experienced them and that's how Bungie intended for you to play them. 

Plus the shift in gameplay mechanics won't be jarring like if you played them in story chronology order.
this makes me excited to play halo MCC
    you should! it's on sale right now if you don't own it, and i'd say it's some nice bang for your buck
        eh it goes on sale quite a lot, and I'm broke rn. plus my laptop can't run it so I'll have to wait a few years
I really loved exploring the levels in Halo 1 and Halo 2 and being able to go out of bounds, unfortunately that wasn't possible anymore in Halo Reach. :(
    I know you could on the level Tip of The Spear once you got to the spire part, it's hard to do but you can hijack a banshee and get out of bounds
Halo: Reach mostly ignored the excellent Fall of Reach novel, and some of its gameplay twists were a bit odd. But I absolutely adore Reach, as it's a wonderful loveletter from Bungie.
I feel so fucking old reading this hahaha.
Reach is the best Halo. Fight me.
    Marathon is the best Bungie game. Let's dance.
Honestly I hate Halo, but Halo reach is a great game. Great character design, solid shooting, a compact plot. It's great and well balanced.
Never played it but read the book when I was 19 without knowing anything about Reach or the team. I was floored. Such a good story. At least 19-year-old me thought. It definitely left an impression.
I absolutely loved it on release and played again last year and it's still amazing.
I enjoyed Halo: Reach a lot as a teenager. The story and characters were amazing. The only part I disliked about the story was how the only female spartan died, and the only spartan to technically survive it all was the sniper dude, unless there's a part of the story I'm missing.

The multiplayer and story were fun. It got a lot of hate when it first came out, if I remember correctly, but it grew on a lot of people. It was a pretty decent game.
    Why was it hated? Asking just out of morbid curiosity. I didn't really find any glaring flaws in the game, altough I haven't yet played multiplayer
        I'm probably blowing up the hate more than it actually was, but while most people enjoyed it, you had a group of people that didn't like that they made a prequel to the Halo story that predated John-117, Master Chief.

It was just different from the original games. I don't think there was genuine hate for the game, but there were people who were bad mouthing it for the simple fact that it wasn't like the traditional Halo games.

I would think ODST was an exception to that rule, since the story wasn't about the Spartans but instead those who aren't super human.
            ah, that makes sense.
        A lot of the new mechanics were horribly implemented into the multiplayer formula when it first launched. Weapon bloom slowed down the time to kill to a crawl and introduced way too much RNG to gunfights, Armor Lock was a cheesy get-out-of-jail card, Sprint and Jet Pack ruined the flow of a lot of the maps. The game got a good title update later on that helped integrate some of these things a bit better and smoothed out some of the rougher edges.
Ah, Reach. I played it once on Heroic and thought it was quite a challenge. At the end of the day though, I just didn't care about these Spartans as much as Master Chief and Cortana. That's the trouble with prequels, you already know >!everybody's going to die!<. Unless you didn't know that? If so, that ending must have really hit hard.

On that note, I really enjoyed Halo 4 and where it took these characters next. That was the last Halo I played before moving on from Xbox 360 to PS4 and now Switch. It's a fitting end for the Collection, I think. Enjoy the ride.
    funny thing is, I knew about the ending, just didn't know about the context, and that somehow made it hit even harder lol
Reach is pretty great game. Personally, I prefer 3 because I think Armor Abilities were a huge mistake (especially for PvP)
I just started playing this yesterday!!!! Only on the 2nd mission but I‚Äôm having a blast. Really like the personalities of the different characters.
I'm in the "Reach wasn't amazing" camp, I thought was OK, but more because of the multiplayer than anything else. That said, I definitely lump the campaign in with 2, 3, and ODST. It's a proper Bungie single player and they always did a consistent job with those games after CE, which is good but rough around the edges. I wouldn't even say it's a particular thing, but everything gels together really well between music/story/weapons.
Halo reach was my favourite. It‚Äôs the only one I look back on and want to play again
Thanks for making this a post. I am a halo player from the beginning all the way until Halo 5 when I just couldn‚Äôt take the boredom of the story at that point. But I would say I enjoyed Halo Reach more than any other in the series. EXCELLENT campaign and an all time ending!
If you like OSTs, I would say you will like pretty much all Halos, I've played all the main ones (except Halo 5 because I don't have the console for it) and the OST are always absolute bangers. 

If you end up liking the franchise, want more and are into RTSs, do consider Halo Wars and Halo Wars 2, Halo Wars 1 can get pretty cheap on steam when it's on sale.
Reach was my first halo, I have a big soft spot for it, I would spend hours upon hours playing the firefight mode with my brothers; also loved the campaign and played through it 2 or 3 times back in the day
Halo: Reach was really my first Halo online experience, and the first new Halo I was able to buy. 

I had an OG Xbox and Halo 2 that I played offline with friends and the campaign a lot, but I pre-ordered Halo Reach when I was in high school and I remember getting a notification that it got delivered when I was at school. Me and about 6 friends all got home and jumped on big team battle. 

I played that game religiously for years. Still my favorite Halo game of all time.
It also has the best armour customisation from any Halo. Maybe even any FPS game.
Reach was my favorite growing up. Spent a lot of time in campaign and matchmaking.
You are important. Without you humanity falls and the covenant activate the halo array.
Definitely check out the other halo games. But I'd advise not playing 5. The story is a crime against humanity, 4 was alright.
Reach was extremely divisive.

It's campaign is very widely beloved and considered in the running for best in the series, but a lot of hard-core fans at the time were upset because it retconned large parts of The Fall of Reach, a widely beloved novel.

                        Explains the online phenomenon then I‚Äôd say. Most large groups online end up as echo chambers.
                That‚Äôs like saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not racist but‚Äù and then speaking about hating certain stereotypes or generalisations of a race
            There's so much irony in this statement it hurts
        Piggybacking to point out that in Halo MCC on PC, both Halo 1 and 2‚Äôs co-op campaigns are unplayable due to bugs that cause crashes and disconnects. For me, they are the highlight of the series, and not being able to play them with my Player 2 made me completely regret my purchase.

This comes down to 343 not giving a shit
            worked fine for me and my friend, though I heard the same about the console version, no?
I think I played it with a friend when it launched on Steam.

Is that a larger problem for the pc port, or have you gotten unlucky? Still bad if it doesn't work for you anyway.
                Co op is completely unplayable on pc for me and my brother. We haven‚Äôt gotten any crashes but it needs to re sync every half a minute or so
                    It's always worked fine for me on pc and I've done at least 10 play throughs of each game with a variety of people.
            The mcc is a disgrace. Took it ages to be able to play it solo even. 343 have fucked the series hard.
            Halo 2 is still broken, but 1 works great.
                I wish it worked for me :/
            I've literally played every MCC game in coop with someone half a country away. The only issue we had was slight input lag. Never any crashes or bugs.
    Reach did change up the formula for multiplayer quite a bit by being the game that introduced armor abilities.

To be fair to the critics, that was *quite* a shakeup compared to 1-3 in changing up the multiplayer dynamic.
        And sick as fucking hell assassinations.
            I agree that they look sick as hell. But I prefer when you didn't have control of your character taken away and moved to a 3rd person cut scene.
                It‚Äôs an integral part of what made me love it   The game froze to gaze upon my cool as fuck sneaky murder.
    The Pokemon community has been the same way for a while. Gets tiring after a while.
        They are right, tough.

Especially when community made Pok√©mon games have easily overtaken the main games in quality for years now.
    > This community is the worst, it's always current game bad, previous game awesome.

Isn't that all video game communities ever?
    Very true, they have a habit of doing that. That was just the first time I remember people I knew in school saying it besides just strangers online.
     Many communities are like that. Just human nature
    Hahaha if only we knew back then what was about to happen 2 years later lol
    Usually in any series, the second game made is great and then they start a steady decline. Not every game mind you, but so many IPs have lived and died this way.

Capitalism means that executives require a game to become more and more mainstream. This tends to lead to a lifecycle of the first game being fairly niche, the second being a sweet balance, and the third going too far.

Some examples include. Lost Planet and Dead Space. You can include Battlefield now too, though it‚Äôs decline has been far more slow until reaching 2042 levels.

Basically my point is, very very often, continuous games in an IP genuinely continue to be worse, watered down, or less indepth than the previous game - thus explaining your ‚Äúpeople always say the previous game was good, current game bad‚Äù scenario. When something new comes out that is worse, it also in context makes the previous game *look* better, and makes people appreciate the good.
I will, right after 3 :)
    Since you said your doing it chronologically, ODST actually takes place between 2 and 3.
        oohhhh, ok, didn't know about that
            Yeah, ODST starts during a mission of 2. It really only had 3 in the title because it used 3's engine since it was the most recent game at the time.
                makes sense. Thanks for the info!
            Just play them in the order they released. It's how Bungie intended for them to be played.
The soundtrack is just sublime.
ODST and Reach are my favorite games in the series, followed VERY closely by 3 and 1. I love the Chief, but they breathed so much life into the world.
ODST is the best halo campaign, period
I've never understood the complaint about the characters not feeling fleshed out.
Replaying the campaign recently and tbh it still holds up. The score, the level design, the simpler plot compared to the rest. 10/10.
    There is no way I'm giving Halo 1 campaign a 10/10 when it has The Library level

That is literally the worst level I've ever played in a AAA shooter campaign
        The first half of Halo CE's campaign is 9/10 - 10/10 territory.

The second half... well.
        To each their own but I really did dig the levels of flood. It wasn't a standout by any means but still I'd put it above most other FPS levels Ive played.
            I just got done playing CE for the first time last week and had no idea that it had the genre flip. Was 100% not expecting a zombie shooter, and loved that there was suddenly now a third team on the battlefield. Remastered graphics ruined it a bit by being so bright, but it was nice to have them easily switched between when I got annoyed with the darkness past the point of fun.
        I agree. Assault on the Control Room is 50% just the same corridors and rooms with slightly different layouts, and then Two Betrayals is basically Assault on the Control Room but in reverse. 

The Library is essentially the same semicircle level stacked on itself three times. 

You could also argue that the first Flood level that starts in the swamp is just copy pasted rooms for the entirety of the interior section.  

Pillar of Autumn through to Silent Cartographer are top tier, but everything from there until the final level are....not good. Even then you could argue that The Maw is just the first level with a different texture kit.
    I tried halo CE recently and got like halfway through but never finished. It felt too old for my taste, the controls and graphics were clunky and some rooms were really frustrating. Enjoyed Halo Reach a lot though
        Halo Reach was a fantastic game, really enjoyed the campaign there too and will fully admit to having a huge bias towards CE given Ive been playing since release and have only fond memories with my buddies lol.
>Never got the chance to dig into CE

Campaign-wise its head and shoulders above the rest imo. Really recommend a playthrough if only to experience iconic levels like Assault on the Control Room, Two Betrayals, and Silent Cartographer. Also Halo is fantastic. And The Maw.

Its really just bangers start to finish.
    Yeah it‚Äôs always been something I‚Äôve meant to go back to for sure! Just never really had the facilities as I only have PlayStation now. One day!
    Okay, I love CE, but the level design is not as good as I remember. I know they were working with limited resources, but damn if it isn't annoying walking through the same room 15 times with the only change being a different enemy type. It detracts away from the game quite a bit for me. Similarly, halo 2 uses quite a few hoard sections where you can't move ahead untill you kill a few wave of enemies. Those are also a bit annoying. Though I think halo 2's writing more than makes up for it.  Also, in CE you can just tell that they didn't have plans for the series to go on. Writing wasn't preparing for a full saga like halo 2 and 3. The combat is very good for its age though.
        Agreed. Assault on the Control Room is basically 50% the same interior corridors and room over and over with slightly different layouts. 

And then Two Betrayals is almost a 1:1 copy of AotCR, just in reverse now. 

Also The Library is not good level design either. It's basically the same corridor stacked on itself three times. 

50% of CE is great level design. The other 50% is quite poor level design.
#CURRENT OBJECTIVE: SURVIVE
    That never hit me quite as hard as the chapter title ‚ÄúThere‚Äôll be another time‚Ä¶‚Äù
        "Lieutenant, get aboard! We've gotta get the hell out of here!"

"Negative. I have the gun. Good luck, sir."
I'd play in release order. It's a little more cohesive because of how drastic the gameplay and graphics change.
    Yeah I think Ill go for it this way
It‚Äôs been years since I played through them but The only thing I can think of is if you started with reach you might not get some of the references with regards to the scientist woman. I can‚Äôt remember her name at the moment. There are a couple interactions where some context of knowing more about her would make things more meaningful or clear. 

Honestly though I had also read some halo books so it‚Äôs hard to say if some of context I‚Äôm talking about came from those vs the main games. 

Regardless, reach would not be confusing at all. They explain what they need to in the game but there might be some nuances you‚Äôd miss
>Will I spoil the later games if I play Reach first (like, I will get used to gameplay comforts, graphics, etc, that are not there in the older CE)?

None of the story will be spoiled. Halo reach end right before the story in halo ce and is about the stuff happening on planet reach (which i think gets a slight mention in ce). The biggest con imo is the worse graphics and more dated controls/combat. You will also spend most of your time in ce alone without allies. 

I recommend playing the games in release order (you can skip odst if you arent a fan of playing a spinoff). You are new to halo so just follow the release order. 

If you dont like halo ce (i didn't), you can just skip it. You can watch a story summary if you decide to skip it. Halo 2 and 3 are much better in almost everything.
do you prefer to see the story in order, or do you prefer to see the mechanics evolve with each game? I think that's what you should be considering
Play in release order. That's how most people experienced them and that's how Bungie intended for you to play them. 

Plus the shift in gameplay mechanics won't be jarring like if you played them in story chronology order.
you should! it's on sale right now if you don't own it, and i'd say it's some nice bang for your buck
    eh it goes on sale quite a lot, and I'm broke rn. plus my laptop can't run it so I'll have to wait a few years
I know you could on the level Tip of The Spear once you got to the spire part, it's hard to do but you can hijack a banshee and get out of bounds
Marathon is the best Bungie game. Let's dance.
Why was it hated? Asking just out of morbid curiosity. I didn't really find any glaring flaws in the game, altough I haven't yet played multiplayer
    I'm probably blowing up the hate more than it actually was, but while most people enjoyed it, you had a group of people that didn't like that they made a prequel to the Halo story that predated John-117, Master Chief.

It was just different from the original games. I don't think there was genuine hate for the game, but there were people who were bad mouthing it for the simple fact that it wasn't like the traditional Halo games.

I would think ODST was an exception to that rule, since the story wasn't about the Spartans but instead those who aren't super human.
        ah, that makes sense.
    A lot of the new mechanics were horribly implemented into the multiplayer formula when it first launched. Weapon bloom slowed down the time to kill to a crawl and introduced way too much RNG to gunfights, Armor Lock was a cheesy get-out-of-jail card, Sprint and Jet Pack ruined the flow of a lot of the maps. The game got a good title update later on that helped integrate some of these things a bit better and smoothed out some of the rougher edges.
funny thing is, I knew about the ending, just didn't know about the context, and that somehow made it hit even harder lol
I was in college when Reach released. Me and my friends grew up playing CE, 2, and 3 together - it's basically all we played in high school.

We *really* disliked Reach due to the armor abilities, particularly armor lock because people would activate it right before you killed them in a gun fight, and then you'd get cleaned up by their teammate or some other opponent before your shields regenerated. Basically a get out of jail free card.

Particular disliked the jetpacks as well... they completely negated any kind of map control and balance. Playing capture the flag, wipe their whole team, pick up the flag and start headed towards base? Well, they'll just spawn, jetpack 100 feet up in the air, and ding you with the DMR.

Reach definitely grew on me, especially now days, but we were super unhappy with it around the time it launched. With the armor abilities and loadouts, barely felt like Halo anymore, so we were always going back to 2 and 3 instead of playing Reach. It didn't feel balanced, and thought armor abilities were a cop out for the not so good players to have a better chance.

edit// it also released with not very many maps, and almost half of which were forge maps.
I remember a lot of people disliking the changes from Fall of Reach, but I remember a lot of people I knew personally hating the new gamemodes along with the balancing issues. Things have clearly turned around on the game but I remember a lot of people hating on the game at the time.
Nah, since 343 inherited the series it‚Äôs not been great. I was a massive fan but I just don‚Äôt like how 343 has handled the series at all. 

Don‚Äôt generalise an entire fan base lol. I loved reach at launch ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è as per usual the vocal minority is the loudest.
    > Don‚Äôt generalise an entire fan base lol.

Oh wow
            Honestly Reddit‚Äôs so full of contrary opinions from everyone it can be hard to take sometimes. People come out of nowhere to disagree just to disagree sometimes! I‚Äôve had people argue with me over things like work health and safety, when my job was being a health and safety officer at the last warehouse I was in‚Ä¶it can be really fucking exhausting lol.

There's so much irony in this statement it hurts
worked fine for me and my friend, though I heard the same about the console version, no?
I think I played it with a friend when it launched on Steam.

Is that a larger problem for the pc port, or have you gotten unlucky? Still bad if it doesn't work for you anyway.
    Co op is completely unplayable on pc for me and my brother. We haven‚Äôt gotten any crashes but it needs to re sync every half a minute or so
        It's always worked fine for me on pc and I've done at least 10 play throughs of each game with a variety of people.
The mcc is a disgrace. Took it ages to be able to play it solo even. 343 have fucked the series hard.
Halo 2 is still broken, but 1 works great.
    I wish it worked for me :/
I've literally played every MCC game in coop with someone half a country away. The only issue we had was slight input lag. Never any crashes or bugs.
I agree that they look sick as hell. But I prefer when you didn't have control of your character taken away and moved to a 3rd person cut scene.
    It‚Äôs an integral part of what made me love it   The game froze to gaze upon my cool as fuck sneaky murder.
Yeah, ODST starts during a mission of 2. It really only had 3 in the title because it used 3's engine since it was the most recent game at the time.
    makes sense. Thanks for the info!
Just play them in the order they released. It's how Bungie intended for them to be played.
I just got done playing CE for the first time last week and had no idea that it had the genre flip. Was 100% not expecting a zombie shooter, and loved that there was suddenly now a third team on the battlefield. Remastered graphics ruined it a bit by being so bright, but it was nice to have them easily switched between when I got annoyed with the darkness past the point of fun.
Honestly Reddit‚Äôs so full of contrary opinions from everyone it can be hard to take sometimes. People come out of nowhere to disagree just to disagree sometimes! I‚Äôve had people argue with me over things like work health and safety, when my job was being a health and safety officer at the last warehouse I was in‚Ä¶it can be really fucking exhausting lol. 

But yeh generalising everyone is not the best move. Everyone‚Äôs different ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è it‚Äôs what makes us all human!
    Let's not pretend that groupthink isn't a thing though. It's a highly documented phenomenon in psychology and is very prevalent in larger communities of people. People will slowly adopt whatever opinion it mindset they see as the "safe" one due to a desire to "fit in."

You can argue that individuals all have different opinions but when in large groups, opinions tend to coalesce.
