[[Still the best menu with the best custom games. Thanks for all the years of memories Bungie. I'll always remember Reach. It has been an honor fellow Spartans!]]





I remember I bought an Xbox 360 back in 2010. It came bundled with Reach. I'd never played Halo before and let me tell you...I had some of the best gaming memories ever from this game during my teenage years. Seeing the whole world of custom games along with the grind for ranking up in multiplayer was so gratifying for me. Same goes for firefight and the emotional campaign. I never could get to Inheritor but I did manage to make it to Brigadier Grade 3 which took a lot work for me. I still play this game on MCC but was never the same as the 360 to be honest. On the 360 it felt like everyone was on the same playing field. The menus were also so easy to navigate and aesthetically pleasing to look at. I'll never understand why the MCC didn't try to adopt any of the design choices from this game. Forge World was also an amazing achievement that I never got tired of looking at. Bungie went out with a bang that's for sure. I'm glad the franchise has continued but I honestly wouldn't have minded if Halo ended here. It was just too good despite its flaws. Rest in peace to the OG Halo Reach for Xbox 360.
    Me too.  I absolutely loved it I would stay up till like 3-5 am just grinding mp.  Rip reach
        Why rip? You can still play!
    I'm sending hugs brother
Why can I hear this picture?
Remember Reach my friend, Remember Reach
I cri every tim
I bought an xbox when I was six years old and played halo reach. I had no xbox live gold and just spent my days playing campaign. I grew up playing this game and it almost makes me cry to see it gone
    almost?!?!?
    bro what do you mean almost, I cried today when i boot up reach still trying to get if they came to hear me beg
        Reach best game ever you hear
            Reach is great
I remember getting the Xbox 360 in preparation for h4, and while I waited a couple months for the release I got reach. Man. I went right back to it after a played the h4 campaign. 

Got my laso on it first, almost got to inheritor. People that say nostalgia blinds just don’t get it, I played 3/odst/reach and 4 the same time. They feel like the same era to me. And reach beat out them all by so much.
Best video game art, style and design direction... ever... cant be topped.
Sadly couldn't even make it to Eclipse before the servers went under, now I end at Noble.
The most formative game of my childhood finally passes to the other side of the horizon. 

Some of the relationships this game helped me build will last the rest of my life. Even if I didn’t play it for like, five years now, (and yeah I know, MCC), it still hurts to see it go. 

Never say goodbye. If you don’t say goodbye, it isn’t really gone. It’s just not here right now.
No game will ever live up to Halo Reach I used to play halo reach on my own when I was around fourteen and I couldn’t stop playing probably the best game that I have ever played
❤️
The best game I've ever played
    Same BTB toxic players was the best for me, I was very well known there too.
Im very disappoint they didn’t add those art backgrounds to MCC!
God, what a heart wrenching day...
Hey man you can still play the match making with the demo [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocFaNmjwXpQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocFaNmjwXpQ).
Halo: Reach is truly an amazing game! Custom games are still online and alive :) Is anyone here down to play some time?
I’ve played through the campaign countless times. It’s helped me escape from shitty places and times. I will forever cherish this game and the halo universe.
Very nostalgic but every Halo Release has had better and better custom games until Infinite.

The sheer endless possibilities in Halo 5's forge made the most amazing fun gametypes ever. Nostalgia blinds

Edit: it's super simple.

Look, I'm not bashing Halo Reach, it was a direct improvement of Halo 3's forge after all. Something coming out that's better doesn't make the old thing bad. Halo Reach's forge and custom games will always be amazing. But we've seen better. We've gotten improved versions of it. Don't like nostalgia blind you and prevent you from having some of the most fun in your Halo career. 

I'll break down my comment. 

Halo Infinite has lackluster custom games, hence the until Infinite. Halo 4 was just Reach's but upgraded and more gametypes and more options. But was also easily moddable and 343 supported it.

Halo 2 Anniversary on MCC has an amazing Forge mode that took Halo 4's forge a step further. It gave us scripting, more gametypes, terrain and classic gameplay.

Halo 5's forge mode is just Halo Forge on complete steroids. The custom game scene is pretty big and still is for Halo 5. And that's simply because of the pure endless level of possibilities more complex scripting that can mess with most functions in the game, so many new forge items from blocks to terrain, foliage, bodies, small details. You could mess with weather, that includes fog and their intensity. You can change the colour and textures for all building blocks and the colour for all pieces, has proper lighting, a massive sandbox full of amazing weapons vehicles and variants of those things, there is fully supported vehicle welding, aka you can make your own vehicles, there weapon mashing that started as a glitch that was so well liked it was kept it. You can do so much with it, grav hammer energy sword? Rocket launching sentinel beam? The sheer amount of custom game options is staggering. Not only that there is a custom browser that's still active to this day full of people playing custom games. 

Point is, each Halo forge/custom games got better and better. There is no arguing that, its how things like that go. Then again our old memories of Reach will always be special, nothing can replace those memories but we can certainly make more with how much better Halo custom games has gotten since Reach.

I absolutely recommend anyone who has Halo 5 or gamepass to look through the custom games browser or better yet find the modes you love and enjoy, because Halo 5 has them. It's easy to host them, just make your game open and pump up that player limit and people will probably join. Maybe do the OG method, play a game of BTB and invite them all after. Halo 5's jenga is the most fun I've ever had in Halo customs. I'd also recommend Death Run and The Cellar. If you are interested in those look in my Halo 5 File share under Unlostmaniac. I have a ton of random fun modes saved but there are many many more. Everyone needs to see The Great Griddle.  Halo 5's forge and custom games was a gift from the heavens and anyone who's played it would agree.
    LOL  
\>"until infinite"  
\>"nostalgia blinds"
    Sorry but no. There’s a reason there’s thousands of people playing reach custom games everyday and is the most popular halo rn believe it or not
        Popularity means jack shit here.

Halo Reach was and is way more popular. But something can be objectively better and more feature packed. Plus as far as I can tell they seem pretty equal in terms of player count.

Doesn't matter what you want to believe. It doesn't change common sense. Halo Reach is nostalgic and was super popular. halo 5 had a bad launch and good features came too late. There's plenty examples of things that are better but less popular. Especially in gaming. Nostalgia blinds.
            Yea right have you seen MCC ?
                Yes
                    It’s like saying just because a game has better graphics or a little smoother gameplay it’s better …not the case at all people want to play FUN not the most updated next generation game
                        Then you didn't even read any of my first comment. I never said graphics or smoother gameplay. 

Halo 5's forge is objectively better. It's feature packed. Filled to the brim. I suggest reading atleast that part of my original comment. Halo 5's forge is a genuine love letter to everyone.

Massive bugdet, scripting, vehicle welding, weapon combining way too many building pieces. People have made some great looking maps.

If you took Halo Reach's forge and added all those features and more. It would be better, right? That's what I'm getting at. The game as a great forge mode resulting in the coolest maps and gamemodes ever. Plus great remakes and evolutions of classic modes. 

Halo 5 has the most options for game types aswell. Another way to put it is, imagine the most basic vehicle. Useless defrost, rattling, small trunk, bad on gas, cant lock it from your key fob, bad stereo, bad steering those crank operated windows. Now obviously its a car, its fine. It works and you can get a lot of use out of it. Lots of people still use those cars due to lack of money, research, nostalgia or care, which is fair enough, no judgement there. That's Halo Reach's forge and custom games. 

Halo 5 is the shiny 2018 model with heated windows, foldable back seats, so much trunk space, gas efficient, hybrid maybe, you can unlock it from your key fob and even your phone, decent stereo system with Bluetooth, smooth steering, and you can control all the windows from one place. Now, a lot more people own the older model. It's been out for a long time, its cheap as hell. People are content with it because it works and does what they need it to. The newer model is obviously better. Its existence doesn't make the old one worse.

Its also preference, if one's cheaper, more popular and does most of what you want then that's great. Point is, more features and improvements make something better. Its as easy as that. Don't get me wrong i absolutely loved playing Reach customs back in the games prime but in that aspect Halo 5 does everything Reach could do but more and better. You get quality and quantity with Halo 5.
                            “Back in the games prime” games been in its prime for 10 years…never went anywhere except move over to MCC. I think you’re forgetting that even when halo 4 and 5 came out all the way till 2017 the OG (360) reach had an average 20k players playing daily. And that’s just the matchmaking counter not all the players that would be in forge and customs. Argue with that all you want, I played the game for 11 years straight I know what I’m talking about. Did halo 5 even have 20k players after like 2 years ? Lmaoooo
                                Halo 5 had a pretty hefty playerbase all of its life.

Your Reach numbers are a lie. Reach averaged a couple thousand. Again you've completely missed the entire point. I'm fully aware of modding and whatnot. Doesn't change anything yet.
                                    Lie ?🤣 how you gonna tell me when I played everyday since 2011 bro. During PEAK times the player count was around 18k-21k…and this was 6 plus years after release. It’s all over YouTube bro if you can’t see it you’re blinded by new shitty feautures no one cares about because the actual game is comeolete dog shit lol
                                    “Heft player base” loses 99 percent of the player base in less then a year…meanwhile all reach did was continue to become one of THE greatest GAMES of all time, not halo…GAMES and all it’s done since is increase in popularity. Where tf is halo 5 lol do people even still play that shit other then maybe warzone cuz that’s the ONLY good thing I ever heard came outta that game. Don’t know tho got the game when it was a 2 week trial from Xbox…never touched that shit again don’t even think I made it though the horrible campaign which is a shame. Beating the halo campaigns has always been a goal of mine with every halo game that’s came out since CE…even managed to get through halo 4s shit show. But 5!? Please.
                            Bro what you realize all of that is MCC forge now ? Halo reach forge is literally insane now thanks to mod support and scripting. I think you really need to go check out the CGB scene. Will really show you how much of a minority you’re in
                            If a 12 year old game is STILL more popular then the most 3 recent releases in the franchise…it can’t be nostalgia bro. I’m sorry you’re in the minority, like you said it’s all preference…your just happens to not be most others preferences. No one gives a fuck about those nerdy useless features if the CORE gameplay is shit.
We will miss you 🫡🙏
just got an xbox for christmas and found out. i’m fucking bawling.
Me too.  I absolutely loved it I would stay up till like 3-5 am just grinding mp.  Rip reach

That's Halo Reach's forge and custom games. 

Halo 5 is the shiny 2018 model with heated windows, foldable back seats, so much trunk space, gas efficient, hybrid maybe, you can unlock it from your key fob and even your phone, decent stereo system with Bluetooth, smooth steering, and you can control all the windows from one place. Now, a lot more people own the older model. It's been out for a long time, its cheap as hell. People are content with it because it works and does what they need it to. The newer model is obviously better. Its existence doesn't make the old one worse.

Its also preference, if one's cheaper, more popular and does most of what you want then that's great. Point is, more features and improvements make something better. Its as easy as that. Don't get me wrong i absolutely loved playing Reach customs back in the games prime but in that aspect Halo 5 does everything Reach could do but more and better. You get quality and quantity with Halo 5.
            “Back in the games prime” games been in its prime for 10 years…never went anywhere except move over to MCC. I think you’re forgetting that even when halo 4 and 5 came out all the way till 2017 the OG (360) reach had an average 20k players playing daily. And that’s just the matchmaking counter not all the players that would be in forge and customs. Argue with that all you want, I played the game for 11 years straight I know what I’m talking about. Did halo 5 even have 20k players after like 2 years ? Lmaoooo
                Halo 5 had a pretty hefty playerbase all of its life.

Your Reach numbers are a lie. Reach averaged a couple thousand. Again you've completely missed the entire point. I'm fully aware of modding and whatnot. Doesn't change anything yet.
                    Lie ?🤣 how you gonna tell me when I played everyday since 2011 bro. During PEAK times the player count was around 18k-21k…and this was 6 plus years after release. It’s all over YouTube bro if you can’t see it you’re blinded by new shitty feautures no one cares about because the actual game is comeolete dog shit lol
                    “Heft player base” loses 99 percent of the player base in less then a year…meanwhile all reach did was continue to become one of THE greatest GAMES of all time, not halo…GAMES and all it’s done since is increase in popularity. Where tf is halo 5 lol do people even still play that shit other then maybe warzone cuz that’s the ONLY good thing I ever heard came outta that game. Don’t know tho got the game when it was a 2 week trial from Xbox…never touched that shit again don’t even think I made it though the horrible campaign which is a shame. Beating the halo campaigns has always been a goal of mine with every halo game that’s came out since CE…even managed to get through halo 4s shit show. But 5!? Please.
            Bro what you realize all of that is MCC forge now ? Halo reach forge is literally insane now thanks to mod support and scripting. I think you really need to go check out the CGB scene. Will really show you how much of a minority you’re in
            If a 12 year old game is STILL more popular then the most 3 recent releases in the franchise…it can’t be nostalgia bro. I’m sorry you’re in the minority, like you said it’s all preference…your just happens to not be most others preferences. No one gives a fuck about those nerdy useless features if the CORE gameplay is shit.
It’s like saying just because a game has better graphics or a little smoother gameplay it’s better …not the case at all people want to play FUN not the most updated next generation game
    Then you didn't even read any of my first comment. I never said graphics or smoother gameplay. 

Halo 5's forge is objectively better. It's feature packed. Filled to the brim. I suggest reading atleast that part of my original comment. Halo 5's forge is a genuine love letter to everyone.

Massive bugdet, scripting, vehicle welding, weapon combining way too many building pieces. People have made some great looking maps.

If you took Halo Reach's forge and added all those features and more. It would be better, right? That's what I'm getting at. The game as a great forge mode resulting in the coolest maps and gamemodes ever. Plus great remakes and evolutions of classic modes. 

Halo 5 has the most options for game types aswell. Another way to put it is, imagine the most basic vehicle. Useless defrost, rattling, small trunk, bad on gas, cant lock it from your key fob, bad stereo, bad steering those crank operated windows. Now obviously its a car, its fine.
