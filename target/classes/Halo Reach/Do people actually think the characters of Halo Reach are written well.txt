[[Do people actually think the characters of Halo Reach are written well]]


Any time Halo Reach is brought up, everyone always points out how it brought them to tears every time one of Noble team would die. And I love Halo Reach, but really? Are these people just really sensitive types?

The only character death I think that had a semblance of weight behind it was Jorge's because he kind of had a personal connection to the mission at hand, and he was easily the most developed (which isn't saying too much.)

Now I was 13 when Halo Reach came out, and I think while all these Spartans go out in style and make for neat moments, these definitely aren't tear jerkers. Noble Team's cast is very one note. I wouldn't even know where to begin to describe Carter. Kat is a little better written as she can be a tad mischievous and sardonic. Emile is shown to be slightly insensitive. But all this I really had to really reach for, pun intended damn it. Oh yeah and there's Jun which I almost completely forgot about and so did the writers apparently. Go ahead and describe Jun. He's a bald sniper and that's about it.


I can respect Kat’s death if only for the fact that it defies the “noble” death cliché. Everyone else goes out like a big damn hero, but here you have an Olympic demigod unceremoniously shot through the head in a moment of vulnerability. 

Just like in real war, there’s no warning, no final goodbyes, no badass last words.

As to whether she was written well, I think her character direction, while brief, made her pretty endearing, which just adds to the sting of her “unfair” death.

And of course, Marty’s score definitely tugs on the heartstrings, especially set against the backdrop of a burning New Alexandria.

I guess my point is that for many of these characters, yeah, the writing doesn’t necessarily stand up on its own. But in concert with the music and art direction, it kinda elevates these characters to more than the sum of their parts, if that makes sense.
    But how did she forget to turn on her damn shields?
        Electromagnetic radiation from the plasma bombardment acted like a massive EMP, disabling their shields. At least, I believe that was the answer
            That's the theory, and I get it, but runs counter to all previous showings of EMPs on Spartan shields. 

Spartan shields flare when hit by EMP's and then pop. None of Noble had this happen. Which suggests either ALL had no shields active, or it's a complete oversight. Would have made more sense if she never put her helmet back on.
                Just an oversight, at that point. It’s certainly not the first or last time the cutscenes haven’t matched up with gameplay or lore
                    Shields, barriers, magic... blargh. Just put your fucking helmet on, private!
Not really, but I'd say they serve their purpose. The story about Reach isn't character-driven, it's location-driven. Noble Team aren't the focus, Reach is. Yeah they're kinda cliché and don't have a lot of depth to them, but they effectively move the plot where it needs to go. Giving a lot of time ingame to developing their characters can be distracting, unrealistic, and just isn't really necessary with how the story is presented.

And I am a fan of their death scenes, though I agree some people are a bit too emotional about them.
    Noble Team is meant to be nothing more than a vessel for the player to experience the fall of Reach. From the opening days of the battle, in which the Covenant forces were nothing more than recon units expanding into a sizeable force out in the plains and rural settings, followed by full on invasion experienced across all the continents and in the main cities, along with the final moments of evacuation. Had it been possible, I'm sure Bungie would've made the player character a random Marine or UNSC Army soldier.

I love the story of Reach and replayed it over the summer. The feeling of desperation that comes from it is incredible.
    Where the hell did this narrative of "Reach is a Location driven game" come from because as far as I remember there's never a reason given in game as to why the player should care about this planet.  
The thing about the characters in Reach is that there are all these little details that make them *feel* human. The body language is huge: throughout the cutscenes, the characters actually seem to be interacting with each other and the environment. Beyond that, they have actual reactions to the events of the story. It’s a nice departure from the stoic confidence of John and the Rookie, and certainly from the robotic storytelling of Halo 5.

Strictly speaking as characters, I’d say the supporting cast of ODST is better than the rest of Noble Team, but for me, the situation of the story led me to care about Noble, especially since we knew from the outset what was at stake and that, ultimately, they would fail.
I wouldn't say written well, but done about as well as they could be for the amount of time we were given with them.

About the emotion behind each one, I can only attribute it to the music.  The tone.  Carter and Emile? Eh, whatevs, to be honest. Kats was unexpected and the immediate tone of the post boom.  And the framing of six holding her in the beam of light? 

Didn't cry, but I felt the emotion behind it.  

Jorge wasn't as heavy because, well, you could tell where he was going with it the instant he said the detonator was fried. 

Tldr not the characters as much as the music.  The music was effective in every moment.

To me, each death showed more and more how hopeless the entire war was. Not for an single instant was noble team winning. They accomplished objectives, but always with great sacrifice and ultimately the victories were fleeting and never actually won them anything 
Halo reach was a good story but I hated it since it threw the cannon established in the books out the window for a game. 
I think for a lot, we didn’t *really* know the Halo story and it had a bigger impact.

I played 3 games as the baddest mother fucker in the galaxy. Spartans never die. As far as I knew, I was the only one. I think a lot of people didn’t know there were more. Oh yeah, humanity never loses in any story (ok, not true but a lot of the time).

Now I found out there are and I’m in a team of 6 of these badasses. Spartans never die. Except here they do. And every small victory led to a bigger obstacle. And then another Spartan dies.

It was a strange feeling being on the losing side.
The story of reach is about the planet itself and from the very start we can see the main theme of the game is death not only of the characters but of the planet as well. I believe the YouTuber 'The Act Man' made a very good video on the topic of reach's story 
Albeit knowing quite a lot of people who played the game, I don't think I've ever heard anyone close to tears over the Nobles' deaths. It's a mix of circumstances and, as others pointed out, the music. I remember someone bringing up, and ever since that day, I've felt the irony behind all of their deaths, that all of them are somewhat logic.

**Jorge**, the "heavy", goes out with a bomb. Albeit it's a death that could happen to everyone, it's especially interesting that it was him. Bungie was able to surround that death with the cliché *Sacrificed Myself for The Cause* and I believe it was captured very well.

**Kat**, the "smart one", gets shot in the head. There's a lot we can put behind this one, like the way she's always a step ahead of everyone, but she died in the most unexpected way. That made for great composition and most likely my favorite one amongst the team.

**Jun**, the "Sniper", disappears and is never heard of again (To Bungie). This one was simplistic imo, but well-thought. It's good they gave him an interesting backstory afterwards with Halo 4 and all, but for someone who doesn't follow lore that much, he really did disappear, just like a sniper.

**Emile**, the "CQC", gets put down by an energy sword/knife, essentially a melee attack.

**Carter**, the "Boss" goes down with his ship. Albeit it's not his ship, and really is just a pelican, it's a great metaphor. Of course, the sacrifice part makes it a lot more cliché, but, without getting into too much details, it's interesting to think what went on in Carter's mind when he made that decision, considering he, along with Emile and Six, could've tried to take on that Scarab.

Ever since I've read that, Noble's death has seemed a lot more interesting than at first sight.

Edit: Typos, grammar
    I really like the way you just broke that down, and had never thought of it that way.  Mind blown 8 years later.
        Same reaction here when I first read it!
    You forgot one.

**Noble 6**, the "Lone Wolf", dies alone surrounded by the bodies of other dead spartans, forgotten on the desolate and glassed rock that was once the 2nd largest center of humanity. 

>"Glad to have your skillset, but we're a team. That lone wolf stuff stays behind, clear?"

>"Got it, sir."
        Totally forgot about good old Six, but yes, that's exactly it. It follows the same ironic pattern. Thanks a lot!

    seeing "the Boss" right after seeing "CQC" made me want to start spinning revolvers
        Oh, everything alright?
Besides Jorge, no. 
Some people are just more emotional than others, and or perhaps will exaggerate their feelings later. As far as their characters go I only remember that I thought Jorge was obnoxious for some reason, and that Emile was quieter. I think character wise concerning the Bungie games the Covenant always produced a better host of personalities with more depth. Really should've did a spin off for them instead imo.
As good as the campaign was, I didn't care about any of the characters.
It's the fact that the entire game your fighting a battle you're never going to win but you keep fighting anyways.
If you focus on the cutscenes and narrative, Reach and the people itself (which symbolizes humanity at its peak) is the main character of the story and with its fall we see Humanity's fall. Noble Team were just the spartans who needed to pass on the torch to our protaganist so he could rise outta the ashes. They were spartans thru and thru and it was Bungie's last venture into the universe, so it was bungie also 'falling' (leaving) and passing the torch to 343. Thats why their deaths were so impactful to me at least and why I got emotional about it.

I can look at the game more objectively now that time has passed but damn that game had so much weight at the time. Still an amazing game too.
I liked Noble Team but, they didn't really have a whole lot going on for their background. Sometimes I'd catch other things I missed about them on another playthrough, other times I'll dig through the wiki to see if there's any other lore about them I missed in the game or other media. I completely forgot about Jun most of the time, I liked that night sniping mission a lot and it was fun but that's all I remember about him. They might be a little light on their backstories and stuff but they get the plot going forward and the whole theme of Reach's story makes sense. Had the theme been different, you would have probably learned more about these people. 

I put my best friend through Reach blind, she never played Halo before and I wanted her to see if she'd like Halo so we can play through all the games together couch co-op. By the end of the game, she told me that she wasn't sure how to feel about Noble Team's individual deaths because she "didn't know much about them." She still enjoyed Reach and it's story nonetheless. We currently want to play through Halo 2 next!
Yeah, Reach's characters are *really* poorly conceived. Why Bungie went with Spartan-IIIs and killed off the only character with any actual emotional connection to the setting (which wasn't explored beyond the surface-level)... I don't really know how to puzzle that one out.

[I wrote a *long* rumination analysis of the game a while back](https://haruspis.blog/2016/12/10/reach-ruminations/) and this is just one aspect of the game I get hung up on...
I think the story rather revolves around the war rather than Noble Team. In Fall of Reach Master Chief feels as no matter how many ground operations they succeed in, they'll never be able to change the tide of the war. The same could be said for Noble Team, also Captain Keyes says it's not all about winning which confuses John and whether a life was spent or wasted. These all apply to their characters, especially to Jorge's death - quite similar to Sams actually
Besides Jorge, and later Jun thanks to his survival, no, not really
I've been saying it for years (and being downvoted). The characters in Reach are not well written. They are flimsy constructions based off your archetypical band-of-heroes story. You have the silent protagonist, the commander, the brash one, the soft spoken intelligent one, the happy-go-lucky, and the gentle giant.

ODST had these same characters, with different names, and any redeeming attributes of the characters were made up _after_ the game launched, or largely carried by the excellent voice acting work (Nathan Fillion is basically the only reason people give a shit about Buck).

I mean hell, look at Scooby Doo or Team Fortress. Then look at reach. You can freely exchange several of the characters and not substantially change the impact or story
Compared to halo 5....
Kats was so damn sad. Just talking and then bam gone. Music was brilliant 
They aren't complex characters but they didn't really needed it to be. 

The story isn't about them as much as it is about the fall of Reach, through their eyes. Eyes of kids turned supersoldiers who are never portrayed outside of combat (or combat-related) situations they trained most their lifetime for. If it took Masterchief long enough to ponder the "being a Machine" part, in a "down time", we certainly shouldn't expect this or more from them, in a situation as critical as Reach's destruction. 

I think the lack of interpersonal relations, emotional/personal complexity, or small talk is completely understandable in their context. Their "simplicity" isn't a lack, just how they are meant to be.

Noble  Team (player included) are Object, not Subject. the tool by which the real subject, Reach's fall is told. And in that respect, they are simple characters that are very well executed.

EDIT : well, probably should've read how many times the same argument was told before throwing my 2 cents. At least we get to learn how diversely the same thing can be said.
Before H4, can we really say that John was well written though? He got less and less dialogue as the games went on in fact.

I personally was saddened by Jorge's death and its futility, Carter's stoic "You're on your own Noble, Carter out," and Six's deliberate sacrifice that lead to a long, drawn out, and utterly unavoidable death being swarmed by an army.

Ironically Kat's death confused me given a single shot did her in, and I was thinking "Wow, lowering your shields in a combat zone, smart, dumbass." And Emile was more "Watch your six, stupid, celebrate later..." followed by "Thanks for making me sacrifice myself anyway, Emile. Hope your grandstanding was worth it..." 

I liked the gravitas of the whole thing though. The ever worsening state as one by one you all go, even Six who was on par in some ways with John 117 being "hyperlethal". Six was intended to show that even John would have died there. 
In terms of what could be covered in a 10 level game, it's good. However, the characters have a lot more potential, Jun in Initiation and New Blood is proof of that.
I don't understand all of this about Reach being a "location" based story. There was absolutely no attempt to make anyone care about this planet. (In the book they did because we spent a lot of time with Chief growing up there, so it was essentially a child watching his home be destroyed).

As for the characters, Emile and Noble 6 are the best because they look the coolest.
    Yeah, that's an argument I've seen become popular over the last two years or so that seems to forget some pretty fundamental things about storytelling.

Setting provides the landscape of context to your story. It sets the mood, the tone, the atmosphere. Its importance cannot be understated.

But it’s only one of three pillars in a text.

The setting is the context in which a story takes place, but that context is meaningless without a plot to affect the setting and characters to drive the plot.

The setting can be a conduit for your themes, it can be a fully realised space to function as its own kind of character, but without those other two pillars then all you’ve got is a place that goes from one state to another with little reason to care *why*.
For the longest time I considered it one of my favourite Halo games, but I recently replayed it after not playing it since like 2013, and it really did not hold up to *any* of the expectations I'd held in my head.

The characters fucking sucked, the story was uninteresting, the only positive thing I can say is that the music is good

Went from a 9/10 in my head to a 5/10 
    I feel the same but not as much. Reachs graphics give me headaches so I can't play it much but in the past 4 years of playing MCC I have liked 3 slot and going back to reach I've noticed things I don't like. I still have tons of nostalgia for it and consider it my favorite.
I agree that Jorge's death is the only one, save for maybe Carter, that was actually of any note. The overall Plot of the game was terrible and didn't actually accomplish anything but complicating the already-existing lore in place. I'm honestly probably one of the few days off the series that would be okay with Reach having having existed. I can't think of a single redeeming quality to it that made it worth being unless you count the art style. Everything else was some better in games before it and nothing it added became relevant in future games.
But how did she forget to turn on her damn shields?
