[[The most forgotten weapon of Halo Reach]]





Overshadowed by more accurate weaponry
    Overshadowed by like literally anything else. What’s it good for? 

AR did flesh better. Needles killed brutes better. Plasma rifle/repeater killed elites better. It doesn’t do anything better than the other weapons. 

If you play with tilt on, it becomes even more useless.
        Fun fact the plasma repeater actually doesn't have a shield dmg bonus.
            That is why plasma rifle is always superior in every way.
                More like why the plasma repeater is one of the worst weapons in the series.
                    Yes. It's bad. But, it's so sexy
                        Beefy plasma rifle go brrrrr! I liked it too. That rifle configuration with plasma rifle features looked so good.
                    Wasn't the repeater and assault rifle pretty much 1-1?
                        Difference was that the repeater had an excess of bloom.
                        Except the plasma repeater shot projectiles (that they had to give the damage bonus lead crosshair to so that they could give it a chance against the AR in invasion)
                    Every automatic weapon in reach just sucked
        I just thought that weapon was fun honestly
            it was fine, but it was just a mag fed plasma rifle. What was even the point when the PP and PR are already in the game?
                Lol true, it is useless and honestly i barely every used it, but I like that they added more weapons because there was another species - the brutes. I'd rather have a variety of weapons than have it be repetitive with the same weapons over and over again
                    They could have just painted the Plasma Repeater red and made it a brute weapon, maybe have it fire six round volleys too. Boom, fun brute weapon with its own niche.
                        True truee
                    This should have more upvotes
        [deleted]
            Source? I remember that true for 3, but not Reach. 

Besides, with how easy it is to get assassinations/beat downs, that wouldn’t be worth it, so it’s even overshadowed by your own fucking arm
                If I recall correctly, the damage bonus in both 3 *and* Reach was fairly small. Like, 2 points for the Spiker.
                    Huh. Might be true. Issue is that’s such a small amount that it’s so insignificant. I don’t think that would ever actually come into play and definitely wouldn’t cause you to melee with the spiker over a different weapon.
                        I remember this From RubyOfBlue's HALO 3 Rebalance Mod.

And he came to the same assessment, two points of damage is insignificant, so he buffed it.

Of course, he lowered the RoF of the Spiker and upped its damage quite a bit and gave its spikes quite a bit of impulse so it could throw corpses.
                            that would fall in line with the lore of the spiker
        If you ever actually used it in custom games, the Reach Spiker was one of the best shield-damaging options in Halo’s entire run. It had 40 rounds per reload with a controllable vertical-recoil pattern, and it could shred shields within just a fraction of a second. The Spiker dominated within close-quarters while providing incredible support-fire at mid-range. It was an assist-machine, and it paired well beside the Pistol, DMR, or Needle Rifle in a way that you would traditionally use the “Noob Combo.”
     
Just because Bungie didn’t include it on maps doesn’t mean it was a bad gun. It was everything you could ever want out of an automatic weapon in Halo: strong versus shields, weak versus health, and projectile-based. It was strong, but you still needed to land a headshot with a precision weapon to confirm the kill.
        It outdoes the other weapons with ammo. I’m not kidding. That’s the only reason I used it so much against the covenant.
        I think that the extra melee damage due to the blades under the barrel was basically the thing that balanced it out.
            2 extra damage apparently. That’s so little you might as well ignore it’s existence
        Probably just melee, it always gave me the sensation it did more damage melee than other weapons
            It does, by such a small margin that it wouldn’t ever actually change anything
        It chewed threw flood like they were paper mache. The Halo 3 version did at least
        Don't forget Pistol does everything better, the DMR did everything better, and the Needle rifle did everything better.

Aim for the face.
            The needler also does everything better.
        Pretty sure I heard on a YT video somewhere that it's classed as a plasma weapon for some reason.
    There was a problem with reach sandbox
        Just because the sandbox has worse guns in it doesn't mean it is bad. If anything I am really thankful they exist for custom games.
            At the same time there was no reason for the Spiker and PR to be as bad as they were.
                I disagree. "In a pinch" weapons are important in a sandbox.
Man I wish the spiker was better. It's one of the coolest-looking Halo guns imo.
    It's been kind of lackluster in both games its been in, disregarding how cool it looks obviously
        It was to be used akimbo lol
        The disrespect to ODST is staggering.



(I realise it is not a fully fledged game in its own right, still fun to say.)
    Even the spikes were cool looking. They would come out of the gun glowing red hot and stick right into a concrete wall, and then they would slowly cool. Made the weapon seem "brutal", honestly even scarier than plasma weapons (at least in game).
        The Spiker in Reach would also heat up at the muzzle and glow a nice cherry red if you fired the whole mag and then cool back down.
    definitely. I like the fact that it's superheated metal being shot.
 Maybe for most,  but the Spiker was one of my favorite weapons back in the day.  I even planned to make prop of it to use in a cosplay,  but I wasn't super knowledgeable about that stuff back then.  

 Brute weapons were beautiful in Reach,  would've loved to have seen the Bruteshot rendered in with Reach graphics and art style
    There were only 2 in reach which is sad. Grav hammer and spiker. Kinda wish they kept the halo 2 brute shot instead of replacing it with the concussion rifle.
        But then what would the elite ultras murder everything in sight with on Legendary?
            Fuel rods
                don't forget plasma launchers that track you
                    And Focus Rifles that melt you
                        And swords that slash you
            Not just legendary but in Heroic and Normal too.
        There are plenty of weapons I wish never got cut but then they never make it back. Right now I am lamenting the shotgun, brute shot, and spartan laser. Same for the fuel rod and flame thrower but to lesser extents, even if they didn't put these weapons on maps I wish they would bring back as many as possible for forge/custom games.
            Each consecutive game I feel should build on the last, providing us with the tools of the last one even if they don’t plan to use them in competitive maps. Imagine how amazing the sandbox would be if we had all of the franchise’s weapons. 5 seemed to lean towards that view near the end, adding in the Pro-Pipe, both Plasma Rifle Variants, the CE pistol, the classic Rocket Launcher, etc. 

Imagine the insane custom games and forge maps that could be made with such an arsenal at our disposal. The Skewer, Sticky Detonator, Spartan Laser, Flamethrower, Brute Shot, Target Locator, and SAW all in one map!
                The way they talked about Infinite before launch made it sound like that’s exactly what it was going to be.
            If the Flamethrower comes back it should really be the CE version.  Halo 3 equipment weapons were fun mostly,  but the Flamethrower has too little range to reduce walk speed by that much.  

 Miniguns,  Missle Pods,  and detachable Gauss Turrets are acceptable as they are I thnk
Spiker kicks ass in campaign
    It's a staple of my legendary runs, because ammo is so plentiful, and the damage is respectable. Plus it often stunlocks small enemies.

I genuinely don't think any of the weapons are "bad", just specialized. People shit on the reach GL, but I have pulled off some hilarious shit in MP by airbursting the EMP function. Watching a falcon fall out of the sky after a GL EMP is cartoonishly funny.
        I mostly played Firefight, and I loved the grenade launcher. Strip shields so your teammates can headshot the tougher enemies, actually deal some damage to Hunters from the front in a pinch, clean out entire groups of Jackals right as they drop, and unlike every other kind of explosive weapon, it refills at ammo crates.
        GL with lots of practice is broken, it was just high skill
    So does the Ravager
    So does anything else if ur on easy or normal
Bungie was a fan of putting in weapons for the enemies to use in the campaign, and only for that purpose. No thought to how they would work in multiplayer, however.

Shame, because the spiker is a cool design. It just doesn't work without a damage boost, or in a game without dual-wielding.
    Yet they put Plasma Repeaters in random spots in doorways and shit on every multiplayer map like they expected someone to use it over the Assault rifle or something
        Weirdest thing, I remember 10 years ago seeing/hearing about some guy who basically only used the plasma repeater. It was there on his bungie stats and everything; his most popular weapon and he had thousands of kills with it in matchmaking. I assume he must have played invasion/elite slayer a lot.
            I don’t believe anyone ever had anything but melee as their most popular weapon.  Like 80% of my kills in Reach were beat downs!
                I was pretty much an Infection main, so the Magnum and Shotgun were miles ahead of any other weapon in PvP kill count.
                that melee key is really ol' reliable in 3 and reach slayer.
                Right now in MCC the DMR is my most used weapon. I bet the other precision weapons are the next 4. 

If melee is in the top 5 I would be surprised.
            I was friends with him and remember finding out he was known for that. He used it in regular multiplayer.
    I don’t think it was the damage that was ever the problem, it has the fastest TtK in 3 other than legitimate one-shots like the sword/hammer/sniper headshot/rockets/etc.  It was incredibly strong— just in a very narrow niche of close range, inaccurate, dual-wieldable automatic weapon, competing with the plasma rifle and SMG.  Still, it could kill faster than the BR, AR, hell even both turrets— so long as you were fairly close to the target.
        His comment was about reach, not 3, just btw. 

>It just doesn’t work without a damage boost, or in a game with no duel wielding
Gonna be honest I forgot it was even in the game
    Yeah, I honestly don't remember the spiker being in Halo Reach, lol
        Where are brutes in Reach?
            They show up in pretty much every level from New Alexandria onwards.
                >They show up in pretty much every level from ~~New Alexandria~~ Exodus onwards.

  


Ftfy
                    Correct, much thanks
                Oh yeah. They show up in that hallway leading up to the jammer. I guess I never picked up the spiker because I preferred my DMR. I haven't played Reach in AGES
Alright I’m just gonna say it, how the hell is this gun not in Infinite in some form?
    I would love for the spiker to come to Infinite has an SMG class weapon.
        Yeah, right now the Needler is awfully lonely in there.
            I think the sentinel beam is under the SMG class too... I'm probably wrong about that though so someone should double check that.
                It is.
            i wish they'd bring back the rest of the smgs, they where a shit ton if fun.
        I'd like to see the SMG come back as well, and maybe add dual wielding with the drawback being that you're limited to using the smgs themselves and cant activate abilities/throw nades etc.
         that would actually be a good way of making it more unique
    Unlike 343, bungo made guns for shits and giggles in campaign, even if it wouldn’t really work in multiplayer. That’s the origin story of the spiked. It looked cool, seemed cool but who gives a shit about balancing. I don’t think 343 has that philosophy.
        Kinda wish 343 did that but we all know 343 loves to pander to competitive players as if anyone actually gives a crap about competitive Halo.
            Exactly! What percentage of the community even cares about competitive, I have to wonder?! This is a sandbox shooter, shouldn’t we be trying to maximize the number of fun weapons in the game over this “competitive balance”?!
                343: *Best I can do is nerf the Mangler because screw the vast majority of the playerbase, only the sweat lords matter.*
            Funny enough as someone who enjoys high skill ceiling games, this is the weakest entry in my opinion with the lack of good precision guns like all the others halos had numerous precison guns before it. Worst selection of guns in halo ever with floaty vehicles.
        The strawberry jam launcher feels very attacked right now!

(Cue “but it’s an area denial tool”)
I loved the gun for duel wielding. Even if it was "out of the meta". I wasn't playing back then with that attitude.
    cant dual wield in reach
        True. I got caught in the reminiscence.
halo 2 pistol. nobody, and i mean nobody uses that shit in MP or campaign unless you are given one.
    My friends made a custom game with the H2 pistol. Crazy king with no shields. Was so much fun, especially when it got chaotic with 8 player ffa since everyone dual wield spammed it.
        So SWAT with objectives.
            SWOTH? Swat of the Hill?
    H2 pistol was used in OG Infection custom games way back in the day…. Man I miss those times.
        Foundation infection. Nostalgia.
            My favorite part was everybody scrambling into one of the rooms while also trying to pile as many boxes in front of the door as possible.
    I liked the design of it, that's about all the good I can say about it though.
    I actually liked the Halo 2 pistol. Especially dual wielding.
    I used it all the time for dual wielding in MP
They have plasma repeaters on like every multiplayer map just sitting around like someone's gonna pick it up but these things are nowhere to be found
    legit higher chance of running at people and meleeing them than killing them with a repeater. I love invasion and what might be my only issue with it is that elites have to use the repeater for round one, if the other team is competent at all you cannot win.
It pops up in custom games quite a bit but I agree, it almost never appears in Multiplayer and it isn't necessary in Campaign or Firefight.
    Its on like 2 or 3 forged maps that went into BTB rotation, and some forge 4v4 maps. I like to pick it up and kill dudes with it if I know its on the map because frankly it's horrendous and if you let someone kill you with this abysmal weapon then... damn. I use it just to flex lmao
Such a great design. I doubt we’ll see it in another game but damn did they make that thing look sick. It didn’t perform too well either
that gun is a lifesaver in new alexandria on a mythic run. i use it all the time on that level.
    Which is a mythic run? Is that like Mythic, thunderstorm, tilt? Or just genuinely only mythic? Because on LASO, this thing is so weak and made weaker by famine and tilt.
        mythic run is usually just Legendary + mythic. but i usually play with mythic, thunderstorm or tilt, catch, toughluck, famine, and fog. it makes for a tough playthrough, but it isnt complete BS and miserable.

edit: thunderstorm + tilt is usually where the most bs comes from. if tilt is on i dont like Thunderstorm on at the same time. so i usually have one or the other on. thunderstorm + tilt + famine makes elites virtual raid bosses lmfao. to be fair on LASO all guns are trash.
Models still looking great 10 years later.
Wait this was actually in reach?
Luv me spiker

Luv me brute shot

Luv me chopper 

Luv me hammer

Ate umans

Ate elites 

Simple as
    Fkn ork based da boys are happi dey get to fight good umies
Played reach again recently (with tilt enabled by mistake) and actually found the spiker to be a pretty neat little weapon - great against the grunts and jackals and gave you something a little nastier than your limp wrist to hit tougher guys like brutes with if they got too close before you got hands on a hammer or sword 

Is it a high tier weapon? Probably not, but it’s certainly economical in the few levels it makes an appearance in the campaign
    Brutes and elites could just be assasinated with zero trouble. Why punch them if you can guarantee an assassination?
        With the tilt skull I wasn’t able to get as close to assassinate them like I usually would - plasma pistols and rifles absolutely tear your shields apart with that skull, so flanking can be a lot riskier than I like
            Flanking? You just circle strafe or jump over them as they go for their melee. It’s super consistent. Without black eye, you can even risk your hp as it’s pretty damn tanky. 

And if you’re not going to be assassinating, there’s even less chance you’ll be punching with the spiker or close enough to be worth using over any other weapon just about. 

If you have tilt, one slot is a dmr/needle rifle/pistol and the other is PP/Repeayer/Rifle. There’s no wiggle room.
                That’s a good tactic - wish my timing was better so I could do it more often, but it makes perfect sense 

Usually I end up getting into front-facing melee quickly, since I can fare fairly well in that respect while marines or a buddy soak fire into the big hitters - I do like the dmr/energy weapon combo but sometimes it’s fun to use atypical methods and see how they fare
The Brutes really needed a better weapon. The spiker just looks too close to the plasma rifle but it doesn't affect shields as much. If they already had their own plasma rifle, why make the spiker so similar?

Maybe if they made the projectiles a little faster but with the capacity to create a supercombine explosion that could hurt nearby players and even kill them if they're right next to the player killed. It would be the needler but with a slightly faster projectile speed and no homing in on players. The explosion would also be a way to break up groups holed up together, pretty much.
    I liked that they got their own regular smg rather than a recolor plasma rifle. And I like to think the Spiker was intended to just cause harm to human combatants rather than be particularly devastating.

It'd be cool if it had the Halo 3 Landfall effect of pinning but not necessarily killing troops outright, but I assume that'd be a pain in the ass to program.
        Well, we have the Skewer now. I was thinking about something like that but the Skewer seems to fill that role pretty well.
            If it's a one shot kill on marines, Chief, etc. then it's not exactly what the spiker was going for in Landfall.

Sure, killing them outright is easier to design than a temporary staple to the wall. Imagine a Spiker with a very weak grav push backwards on impact, and movement becomes temporarily impossible if you get knocked back into a wall.
                I'm sure it could be done in a game like Overwatch. Blizzard is the only company I know of that can pull that off.
I never dropped the AR.

Spawn with a sniper/magnum? You bet my ass was finning for an AR on the floor.
    Meanwhile I was dropping the AR for the first plasma pistol I found
We definitely needed more Brute weapons in Infinite.  I'd like to see the spiker, brute plasma rifle, and maybe even a banished styled double barrel shotgun or something, that'd be really cool to see.  I wouldn't mind the brute shot either.
Isnt it in 3???
    Younger generation only remembers reach. It was in Halo 3.
        Bro how young you talking bc I'm 14
            Well im 28
            And Halo 3 came out before you were born lol
                You ain't have to do me like that bruh 🤣
                    Lol you kind of set yourself up
I tried to duel wield em and charge at an enemy , it did not work at all lol .
Because it's the needler but worse. It has no reason to exist outside of badge engineering.
    its a slower neddler with a blade
There’s nothing wrong with it, but there’s no reason for me to pick it up either
I 'member
Fun to shoot but it sucks
It was a cool weapon to use  in Machinima 

Rise of the Spartans Sev comes to mind
I love the Spiker, so much fun to use and visually appealing all around especially when you land hits on a target.
Literally a gun made for the sake of brutes having a gun
I miss the Needle Rifle
I actually thought this was a mod for a second.
What about the complete shit focus rifle
On a side note, I always thought reach had some of the most beautiful sky boxes
    Yeah especially this one, you can see covenant cruisers glassing the planet out in the very distance when there is a flash of lightning.
*Quite franklys at that title  *
    what
Can we admit it deserves to be left behind ?
Most weapons in reach were bad, this one included. Terrible game overall
    [removed]
I DESPISE that weapon. Was so useless. Inaccurate af and did like no damage. I would only ever use it when I ran out of ammo for either of my guns and nothing else was available.
It's literally a weapon in Halo 3?
At least they actually put the damn iconic gun in unlike infinite
    Who cares? If it sucks and adds nothing to the game, why does it matter how “iconic” it is?
        Makes the sandbox more unique??
            It doesn’t make the sandbox unique. The whole point is that adding unique weapons helps the sandbox, not just a brute assault rifle.
                Idk its just cool how they actually put the gun in from previous games, it's like they care. The variety is nice too tho
The spiker was a FLOP. Just like the Silver Timeline show. It’s not even worthy to call it Halo. It’s Silver Timelime.
Was this really in the Reach campaign?
    Yeah
    yes
DMR and Plasma Pistol combo, nothing else matters
    Dmr with Plasma rifle/Repeater was more efficient on LASO due to famine and tilt though
It always bugged me that it didn’t even spawn in multiplayer from what I can remember
Shoot a couple times and knife, I love this weapon in all modes
I always forget this gun even exists in Reach outside of customs
One of my favorites…
Hot take: the spiker is the most fun to use brute weapon
    Concussion rifle and brute shot.
        I don’t find them fun to use in comparison to the god-tier spiker. And the concussion rifle isn’t a brute weapon
It was somewhat useful in h3 since thw blades made short work of the flood. Since the halos moved away from the flood and so it has lost its usefulness entirely, esp without dual wielding...
“Holding an enemy weapon like this….I don’t like it” 2:01 https://youtu.be/GX5Kh1f5ksY
“You don’t have the firepower sir.”

“But I’ve got the mass.”

“….copy that.”

“Good luck Noble, Carter out.” *boom* 

“Crevice to the east….let’s go.”

(Think I remembered that right)
Wasnt that guns issue that it was rlly only useful when Dual wielded in Halo 3
This is not a bad thing
Great in campaign, not so much in mp
Because it sucks
Yeah, that's just a cool weapon but useless, DMR, or plasma pistol + pistol combo was just superior to kill elites and small enemies
Speak for yourself, n00b
That’s a weird plasma repeater.
Not really
For a second there I thought this was a troll post and this was really just a mod or something lol

Totally forgot this was in the game.
Man as much as I loved the Bungie games, dual wielding sure did create a lot of weapon redundancy/cross over. Loved the idea of the spiker, wish it was more unique in its role, esp with their decision to remove dual wielding in Reach. 

On that note always wanted plasma rifle to get its stun feature back from H: CE. But even the dual wielded plasma rifle had more utility than this gun IMO.
Why its not in infinite, i have no idea...
what kind of crack are you smoking
Was excited to have this back for infinite.
What a shame.
    well you got its distant cousin
Maybe I’m buggin but I literally ran spiker all the time, campaign and firefight wise. specifically in ODST because of the melee damage increase, just always love giving aliens the backhand
Shit weapon most of the time. Main use I found for it was against the brutes
    it was pretty good for melee
It would've been much better if you could've dual wielded like in Halo 3
I miss the needle rifle
Spiker without dual wielding = useless
I loved using the Spiker. Thought the red hot spikes cooling down was awesome. If you accidently friendly fired, marines would walk around with spikes protruding from their bodies
Speak for yourself, I love that thing.
Melee go whack
Swear I think I’ve never picked this up and if I did, I picked up the next gun I saw.
I saw a boomco replica of it
Wait, was the spoke added into reach? I have zero memory of it in the original game
As far as reach weapons, it was only better than the plasma rifle which was very forgettable itself in reach. Those guns only worked in 3 as dual wielding
That’s like the main problem with Reach’s sandbox. So much stuff is overshadowed or just not viable in anyway. I want the spider to be revisited and get a much needed buff!
I didn’t even know it was in Reach.
Rapid fire mangler
It should've been the inaccurate but hard hitting weapon. I mean it's superheated spikes. Should mess anything up but be hard to hit with.
Most forgotten gun in the entire series is sticky grenade gun halo 4
used it once in exodus lol
Any time I was playing the campaign, I was rocking this gun. Blast enemies while walking towards them and SMACK. Reload. Next enemy. SO satisfying. God I loved this gun.
I still don’t know what this thing is or does
Hey the brute guns slap
B.U.N.G.L.E remembers
Need SMG back. And dual wielding.
I don’t get get why infinite with its brute-heavy enemies didn’t have this or the brute shot. The two best brute weapons. But let’s give them human shotguns.
i actually liked it. Maybe it's from that H3 ad where they have a museum with covenant weapons.
Nice of them to go the extra mile to include it for the few Brute missions in the game, but I wish they made it more interesting. Definitely felt like an extra gun just for campaign.
Tbh, that weapon sucked
the spiker has my favourite noise
I really like halo reaches spiker. IIRC kills brutes effectively close to mid-range in under a mag plus the reload is quick.
It look cool I rest my case
i remember that thing been a while since i used it but it was fun to use
Why does it do plasma damage. It shoots metal spikes.
Halo 3 spiker was better
Tbh most of Reachs sandbox sucked. 

The grenande launcher? Objectively bad. Legit does nothing on heroic and above, the blast radius is abysmally small.
I miss the needle rifle like you motherfuckers wouldn’t believe
I dont remember that gun at all and i still play reach probably atleast once a month
the forge mode focus rifle?
I miss the needler rifle
Needle rifle, plasma grenade launcher, gold club, grenade launcher, plasma repeater, focus rifle. These are the forgotten.
    Grenade launcher and golf club were not forgotten at all both have been in halo up until halo infinite where they’ve been removed
On legendary when you needed any weapon, it helped
I think the p2016 is more forgotten
Yup. Rarely ever saw it in BTB except on 1 or 2 maps
The spiker is cool, I thought it was in 3 as well tho
Any brute weapon is my go to when i need to bludgeon the shit out of a grunt or jackal and shoot them to death. Same goes with Halo 3 & Halo 3 ODST, especially with the godforesaken flood. God i hate them... wait a minute... was the Brute Spiker in Halo 3 ODST? Im asking because my brain keeps thinking it was replaced by the Brute Plasma Rifle even though im positive they both coexist.
Overshadowed by like literally anything else. What’s it good for? 

AR did flesh better. Needles killed brutes better. Plasma rifle/repeater killed elites better. It doesn’t do anything better than the other weapons. 

If you play with tilt on, it becomes even more useless.
    Fun fact the plasma repeater actually doesn't have a shield dmg bonus.
        That is why plasma rifle is always superior in every way.
            More like why the plasma repeater is one of the worst weapons in the series.
                Yes. It's bad. But, it's so sexy
                    Beefy plasma rifle go brrrrr! I liked it too. That rifle configuration with plasma rifle features looked so good.
                Wasn't the repeater and assault rifle pretty much 1-1?
                    Difference was that the repeater had an excess of bloom.
                    Except the plasma repeater shot projectiles (that they had to give the damage bonus lead crosshair to so that they could give it a chance against the AR in invasion)
                Every automatic weapon in reach just sucked
    I just thought that weapon was fun honestly
        it was fine, but it was just a mag fed plasma rifle. What was even the point when the PP and PR are already in the game?
            Lol true, it is useless and honestly i barely every used it, but I like that they added more weapons because there was another species - the brutes. I'd rather have a variety of weapons than have it be repetitive with the same weapons over and over again
                They could have just painted the Plasma Repeater red and made it a brute weapon, maybe have it fire six round volleys too. Boom, fun brute weapon with its own niche.
                    True truee

        Source? I remember that true for 3, but not Reach. 

Besides, with how easy it is to get assassinations/beat downs, that wouldn’t be worth it, so it’s even overshadowed by your own fucking arm
            If I recall correctly, the damage bonus in both 3 *and* Reach was fairly small. Like, 2 points for the Spiker.
                Huh. Might be true. Issue is that’s such a small amount that it’s so insignificant. I don’t think that would ever actually come into play and definitely wouldn’t cause you to melee with the spiker over a different weapon.
                    I remember this From RubyOfBlue's HALO 3 Rebalance Mod.

And he came to the same assessment, two points of damage is insignificant, so he buffed it.

Of course, he lowered the RoF of the Spiker and upped its damage quite a bit and gave its spikes quite a bit of impulse so it could throw corpses.
                        that would fall in line with the lore of the spiker
    If you ever actually used it in custom games, the Reach Spiker was one of the best shield-damaging options in Halo’s entire run. It had 40 rounds per reload with a controllable vertical-recoil pattern, and it could shred shields within just a fraction of a second. The Spiker dominated within close-quarters while providing incredible support-fire at mid-range. It was an assist-machine, and it paired well beside the Pistol, DMR, or Needle Rifle in a way that you would traditionally use the “Noob Combo.”
     
Just because Bungie didn’t include it on maps doesn’t mean it was a bad gun. It was everything you could ever want out of an automatic weapon in Halo: strong versus shields, weak versus health, and projectile-based. It was strong, but you still needed to land a headshot with a precision weapon to confirm the kill.
    It outdoes the other weapons with ammo. I’m not kidding. That’s the only reason I used it so much against the covenant.
    I think that the extra melee damage due to the blades under the barrel was basically the thing that balanced it out.
        2 extra damage apparently. That’s so little you might as well ignore it’s existence
    Probably just melee, it always gave me the sensation it did more damage melee than other weapons
        It does, by such a small margin that it wouldn’t ever actually change anything
    It chewed threw flood like they were paper mache. The Halo 3 version did at least
    Don't forget Pistol does everything better, the DMR did everything better, and the Needle rifle did everything better.

Aim for the face.
        The needler also does everything better.
    Pretty sure I heard on a YT video somewhere that it's classed as a plasma weapon for some reason.
There was a problem with reach sandbox
    Just because the sandbox has worse guns in it doesn't mean it is bad. If anything I am really thankful they exist for custom games.
        At the same time there was no reason for the Spiker and PR to be as bad as they were.
            I disagree. "In a pinch" weapons are important in a sandbox.
It's been kind of lackluster in both games its been in, disregarding how cool it looks obviously
    It was to be used akimbo lol
    The disrespect to ODST is staggering.



(I realise it is not a fully fledged game in its own right, still fun to say.)
Even the spikes were cool looking. They would come out of the gun glowing red hot and stick right into a concrete wall, and then they would slowly cool. Made the weapon seem "brutal", honestly even scarier than plasma weapons (at least in game).
    The Spiker in Reach would also heat up at the muzzle and glow a nice cherry red if you fired the whole mag and then cool back down.
definitely. I like the fact that it's superheated metal being shot.
There were only 2 in reach which is sad. Grav hammer and spiker. Kinda wish they kept the halo 2 brute shot instead of replacing it with the concussion rifle.
    But then what would the elite ultras murder everything in sight with on Legendary?
        Fuel rods
            don't forget plasma launchers that track you
                And Focus Rifles that melt you
                    And swords that slash you
        Not just legendary but in Heroic and Normal too.
    There are plenty of weapons I wish never got cut but then they never make it back. Right now I am lamenting the shotgun, brute shot, and spartan laser. Same for the fuel rod and flame thrower but to lesser extents, even if they didn't put these weapons on maps I wish they would bring back as many as possible for forge/custom games.
        Each consecutive game I feel should build on the last, providing us with the tools of the last one even if they don’t plan to use them in competitive maps. Imagine how amazing the sandbox would be if we had all of the franchise’s weapons. 5 seemed to lean towards that view near the end, adding in the Pro-Pipe, both Plasma Rifle Variants, the CE pistol, the classic Rocket Launcher, etc. 

Imagine the insane custom games and forge maps that could be made with such an arsenal at our disposal. The Skewer, Sticky Detonator, Spartan Laser, Flamethrower, Brute Shot, Target Locator, and SAW all in one map!
            The way they talked about Infinite before launch made it sound like that’s exactly what it was going to be.
        If the Flamethrower comes back it should really be the CE version.  Halo 3 equipment weapons were fun mostly,  but the Flamethrower has too little range to reduce walk speed by that much.  

 Miniguns,  Missle Pods,  and detachable Gauss Turrets are acceptable as they are I thnk
It's a staple of my legendary runs, because ammo is so plentiful, and the damage is respectable. Plus it often stunlocks small enemies.

I genuinely don't think any of the weapons are "bad", just specialized. People shit on the reach GL, but I have pulled off some hilarious shit in MP by airbursting the EMP function. Watching a falcon fall out of the sky after a GL EMP is cartoonishly funny.
    I mostly played Firefight, and I loved the grenade launcher. Strip shields so your teammates can headshot the tougher enemies, actually deal some damage to Hunters from the front in a pinch, clean out entire groups of Jackals right as they drop, and unlike every other kind of explosive weapon, it refills at ammo crates.
    GL with lots of practice is broken, it was just high skill
So does the Ravager
So does anything else if ur on easy or normal
Yet they put Plasma Repeaters in random spots in doorways and shit on every multiplayer map like they expected someone to use it over the Assault rifle or something
    Weirdest thing, I remember 10 years ago seeing/hearing about some guy who basically only used the plasma repeater. It was there on his bungie stats and everything; his most popular weapon and he had thousands of kills with it in matchmaking. I assume he must have played invasion/elite slayer a lot.
        I don’t believe anyone ever had anything but melee as their most popular weapon.  Like 80% of my kills in Reach were beat downs!
            I was pretty much an Infection main, so the Magnum and Shotgun were miles ahead of any other weapon in PvP kill count.
            that melee key is really ol' reliable in 3 and reach slayer.
            Right now in MCC the DMR is my most used weapon. I bet the other precision weapons are the next 4. 

If melee is in the top 5 I would be surprised.
        I was friends with him and remember finding out he was known for that. He used it in regular multiplayer.
I don’t think it was the damage that was ever the problem, it has the fastest TtK in 3 other than legitimate one-shots like the sword/hammer/sniper headshot/rockets/etc.  It was incredibly strong— just in a very narrow niche of close range, inaccurate, dual-wieldable automatic weapon, competing with the plasma rifle and SMG.  Still, it could kill faster than the BR, AR, hell even both turrets— so long as you were fairly close to the target.
    His comment was about reach, not 3, just btw. 

>It just doesn’t work without a damage boost, or in a game with no duel wielding
Yeah, I honestly don't remember the spiker being in Halo Reach, lol
    Where are brutes in Reach?
        They show up in pretty much every level from New Alexandria onwards.
            >They show up in pretty much every level from ~~New Alexandria~~ Exodus onwards.

  


Ftfy
                Correct, much thanks
            Oh yeah. They show up in that hallway leading up to the jammer. I guess I never picked up the spiker because I preferred my DMR. I haven't played Reach in AGES
I would love for the spiker to come to Infinite has an SMG class weapon.
    Yeah, right now the Needler is awfully lonely in there.
        I think the sentinel beam is under the SMG class too... I'm probably wrong about that though so someone should double check that.
            It is.
        i wish they'd bring back the rest of the smgs, they where a shit ton if fun.
    I'd like to see the SMG come back as well, and maybe add dual wielding with the drawback being that you're limited to using the smgs themselves and cant activate abilities/throw nades etc.
     that would actually be a good way of making it more unique
Unlike 343, bungo made guns for shits and giggles in campaign, even if it wouldn’t really work in multiplayer. That’s the origin story of the spiked. It looked cool, seemed cool but who gives a shit about balancing. I don’t think 343 has that philosophy.
    Kinda wish 343 did that but we all know 343 loves to pander to competitive players as if anyone actually gives a crap about competitive Halo.
        Exactly! What percentage of the community even cares about competitive, I have to wonder?! This is a sandbox shooter, shouldn’t we be trying to maximize the number of fun weapons in the game over this “competitive balance”?!
            343: *Best I can do is nerf the Mangler because screw the vast majority of the playerbase, only the sweat lords matter.*
        Funny enough as someone who enjoys high skill ceiling games, this is the weakest entry in my opinion with the lack of good precision guns like all the others halos had numerous precison guns before it. Worst selection of guns in halo ever with floaty vehicles.
    The strawberry jam launcher feels very attacked right now!

(Cue “but it’s an area denial tool”)
cant dual wield in reach
    True. I got caught in the reminiscence.
My friends made a custom game with the H2 pistol. Crazy king with no shields. Was so much fun, especially when it got chaotic with 8 player ffa since everyone dual wield spammed it.
    So SWAT with objectives.
        SWOTH? Swat of the Hill?
H2 pistol was used in OG Infection custom games way back in the day…. Man I miss those times.
    Foundation infection. Nostalgia.
        My favorite part was everybody scrambling into one of the rooms while also trying to pile as many boxes in front of the door as possible.
I liked the design of it, that's about all the good I can say about it though.
I actually liked the Halo 2 pistol. Especially dual wielding.
I used it all the time for dual wielding in MP
legit higher chance of running at people and meleeing them than killing them with a repeater. I love invasion and what might be my only issue with it is that elites have to use the repeater for round one, if the other team is competent at all you cannot win.
Its on like 2 or 3 forged maps that went into BTB rotation, and some forge 4v4 maps. I like to pick it up and kill dudes with it if I know its on the map because frankly it's horrendous and if you let someone kill you with this abysmal weapon then... damn. I use it just to flex lmao
Which is a mythic run? Is that like Mythic, thunderstorm, tilt? Or just genuinely only mythic? Because on LASO, this thing is so weak and made weaker by famine and tilt.
    mythic run is usually just Legendary + mythic. but i usually play with mythic, thunderstorm or tilt, catch, toughluck, famine, and fog. it makes for a tough playthrough, but it isnt complete BS and miserable.

edit: thunderstorm + tilt is usually where the most bs comes from. if tilt is on i dont like Thunderstorm on at the same time. so i usually have one or the other on. thunderstorm + tilt + famine makes elites virtual raid bosses lmfao. to be fair on LASO all guns are trash.
Fkn ork based da boys are happi dey get to fight good umies
Brutes and elites could just be assasinated with zero trouble. Why punch them if you can guarantee an assassination?
    With the tilt skull I wasn’t able to get as close to assassinate them like I usually would - plasma pistols and rifles absolutely tear your shields apart with that skull, so flanking can be a lot riskier than I like
        Flanking? You just circle strafe or jump over them as they go for their melee. It’s super consistent. Without black eye, you can even risk your hp as it’s pretty damn tanky. 

And if you’re not going to be assassinating, there’s even less chance you’ll be punching with the spiker or close enough to be worth using over any other weapon just about. 

If you have tilt, one slot is a dmr/needle rifle/pistol and the other is PP/Repeayer/Rifle. There’s no wiggle room.
            That’s a good tactic - wish my timing was better so I could do it more often, but it makes perfect sense 

Usually I end up getting into front-facing melee quickly, since I can fare fairly well in that respect while marines or a buddy soak fire into the big hitters - I do like the dmr/energy weapon combo but sometimes it’s fun to use atypical methods and see how they fare
I liked that they got their own regular smg rather than a recolor plasma rifle. And I like to think the Spiker was intended to just cause harm to human combatants rather than be particularly devastating.

It'd be cool if it had the Halo 3 Landfall effect of pinning but not necessarily killing troops outright, but I assume that'd be a pain in the ass to program.
    Well, we have the Skewer now. I was thinking about something like that but the Skewer seems to fill that role pretty well.
        If it's a one shot kill on marines, Chief, etc. then it's not exactly what the spiker was going for in Landfall.

Sure, killing them outright is easier to design than a temporary staple to the wall. Imagine a Spiker with a very weak grav push backwards on impact, and movement becomes temporarily impossible if you get knocked back into a wall.
            I'm sure it could be done in a game like Overwatch. Blizzard is the only company I know of that can pull that off.
Meanwhile I was dropping the AR for the first plasma pistol I found
Younger generation only remembers reach. It was in Halo 3.
    Bro how young you talking bc I'm 14
        Well im 28
        And Halo 3 came out before you were born lol
            You ain't have to do me like that bruh 🤣
                Lol you kind of set yourself up
its a slower neddler with a blade
Yeah especially this one, you can see covenant cruisers glassing the planet out in the very distance when there is a flash of lightning.
what
[removed]
Who cares? If it sucks and adds nothing to the game, why does it matter how “iconic” it is?
    Makes the sandbox more unique??
        It doesn’t make the sandbox unique. The whole point is that adding unique weapons helps the sandbox, not just a brute assault rifle.
            Idk its just cool how they actually put the gun in from previous games, it's like they care. The variety is nice too tho
Yeah
yes
Dmr with Plasma rifle/Repeater was more efficient on LASO due to famine and tilt though
Concussion rifle and brute shot.
    I don’t find them fun to use in comparison to the god-tier spiker. And the concussion rifle isn’t a brute weapon
well you got its distant cousin
it was pretty good for melee
Grenade launcher and golf club were not forgotten at all both have been in halo up until halo infinite where they’ve been removed
Fun fact the plasma repeater actually doesn't have a shield dmg bonus.
    That is why plasma rifle is always superior in every way.
        More like why the plasma repeater is one of the worst weapons in the series.

    More like why the plasma repeater is one of the worst weapons in the series.
        Yes. It's bad. But, it's so sexy
            Beefy plasma rifle go brrrrr! I liked it too. That rifle configuration with plasma rifle features looked so good.
        Wasn't the repeater and assault rifle pretty much 1-1?
            Difference was that the repeater had an excess of bloom.
            Except the plasma repeater shot projectiles (that they had to give the damage bonus lead crosshair to so that they could give it a chance against the AR in invasion)
        Every automatic weapon in reach just sucked
it was fine, but it was just a mag fed plasma rifle. What was even the point when the PP and PR are already in the game?
    Lol true, it is useless and honestly i barely every used it, but I like that they added more weapons because there was another species - the brutes. I'd rather have a variety of weapons than have it be repetitive with the same weapons over and over again
        They could have just painted the Plasma Repeater red and made it a brute weapon, maybe have it fire six round volleys too. Boom, fun brute weapon with its own niche.
            True truee
        This should have more upvotes
Source? I remember that true for 3, but not Reach. 

Besides, with how easy it is to get assassinations/beat downs, that wouldn’t be worth it, so it’s even overshadowed by your own fucking arm
    If I recall correctly, the damage bonus in both 3 *and* Reach was fairly small. Like, 2 points for the Spiker.
        Huh. Might be true. Issue is that’s such a small amount that it’s so insignificant. I don’t think that would ever actually come into play and definitely wouldn’t cause you to melee with the spiker over a different weapon.
            I remember this From RubyOfBlue's HALO 3 Rebalance Mod.

And he came to the same assessment, two points of damage is insignificant, so he buffed it.

Of course, he lowered the RoF of the Spiker and upped its damage quite a bit and gave its spikes quite a bit of impulse so it could throw corpses.
                that would fall in line with the lore of the spiker
2 extra damage apparently. That’s so little you might as well ignore it’s existence
It does, by such a small margin that it wouldn’t ever actually change anything
The needler also does everything better.
At the same time there was no reason for the Spiker and PR to be as bad as they were.
    I disagree. "In a pinch" weapons are important in a sandbox.
Fuel rods
    don't forget plasma launchers that track you
        And Focus Rifles that melt you
            And swords that slash you
Not just legendary but in Heroic and Normal too.
Each consecutive game I feel should build on the last, providing us with the tools of the last one even if they don’t plan to use them in competitive maps. Imagine how amazing the sandbox would be if we had all of the franchise’s weapons. 5 seemed to lean towards that view near the end, adding in the Pro-Pipe, both Plasma Rifle Variants, the CE pistol, the classic Rocket Launcher, etc. 

Imagine the insane custom games and forge maps that could be made with such an arsenal at our disposal. The Skewer, Sticky Detonator, Spartan Laser, Flamethrower, Brute Shot, Target Locator, and SAW all in one map!
    The way they talked about Infinite before launch made it sound like that’s exactly what it was going to be.
If the Flamethrower comes back it should really be the CE version.  Halo 3 equipment weapons were fun mostly,  but the Flamethrower has too little range to reduce walk speed by that much.  

 Miniguns,  Missle Pods,  and detachable Gauss Turrets are acceptable as they are I thnk
I don’t believe anyone ever had anything but melee as their most popular weapon.  Like 80% of my kills in Reach were beat downs!
    I was pretty much an Infection main, so the Magnum and Shotgun were miles ahead of any other weapon in PvP kill count.
    that melee key is really ol' reliable in 3 and reach slayer.
    Right now in MCC the DMR is my most used weapon. I bet the other precision weapons are the next 4. 

If melee is in the top 5 I would be surprised.
I was friends with him and remember finding out he was known for that. He used it in regular multiplayer.
They show up in pretty much every level from New Alexandria onwards.

        Correct, much thanks
    Oh yeah. They show up in that hallway leading up to the jammer. I guess I never picked up the spiker because I preferred my DMR. I haven't played Reach in AGES
I think the sentinel beam is under the SMG class too... I'm probably wrong about that though so someone should double check that.
    It is.
i wish they'd bring back the rest of the smgs, they where a shit ton if fun.
Exactly! What percentage of the community even cares about competitive, I have to wonder?! This is a sandbox shooter, shouldn’t we be trying to maximize the number of fun weapons in the game over this “competitive balance”?!
    343: *Best I can do is nerf the Mangler because screw the vast majority of the playerbase, only the sweat lords matter.*
Funny enough as someone who enjoys high skill ceiling games, this is the weakest entry in my opinion with the lack of good precision guns like all the others halos had numerous precison guns before it. Worst selection of guns in halo ever with floaty vehicles.
SWOTH? Swat of the Hill?
My favorite part was everybody scrambling into one of the rooms while also trying to pile as many boxes in front of the door as possible.
Flanking? You just circle strafe or jump over them as they go for their melee. It’s super consistent. Without black eye, you can even risk your hp as it’s pretty damn tanky. 

And if you’re not going to be assassinating, there’s even less chance you’ll be punching with the spiker or close enough to be worth using over any other weapon just about. 

If you have tilt, one slot is a dmr/needle rifle/pistol and the other is PP/Repeayer/Rifle. There’s no wiggle room.
    That’s a good tactic - wish my timing was better so I could do it more often, but it makes perfect sense 

Usually I end up getting into front-facing melee quickly, since I can fare fairly well in that respect while marines or a buddy soak fire into the big hitters - I do like the dmr/energy weapon combo but sometimes it’s fun to use atypical methods and see how they fare
If it's a one shot kill on marines, Chief, etc. then it's not exactly what the spiker was going for in Landfall.

Sure, killing them outright is easier to design than a temporary staple to the wall. Imagine a Spiker with a very weak grav push backwards on impact, and movement becomes temporarily impossible if you get knocked back into a wall.
    I'm sure it could be done in a game like Overwatch. Blizzard is the only company I know of that can pull that off.
Well im 28
And Halo 3 came out before you were born lol
    You ain't have to do me like that bruh 🤣
        Lol you kind of set yourself up
It doesn’t make the sandbox unique. The whole point is that adding unique weapons helps the sandbox, not just a brute assault rifle.
    Idk its just cool how they actually put the gun in from previous games, it's like they care. The variety is nice too tho
