[[Biggest Problem with FO4‚Äôs Voiced Protagonist (IMO)]]


So generally I think non-voiced is better for Bethesda games, but after playing a ton of games where it worked amazingly (Mass Effect, the Witcher, Cyberpunk), I think the biggest issue was the tone

They boxed you into playing this goofy New England dad in a sleepy New England setting.

I don‚Äôt want to be some goofy fcking dad. If you‚Äôre going to give me a voice, give me the voice of a ruthless badass

And the character appearance didn‚Äôt help ‚Äî why were the noses all so big??


Yeah I know Todd Howard said the voiced protagonist in F4 was a mistake, and F76 has stat and perk based dialogue that is very mechanical, which has it's own issues

As you said Cyberpunk 2077 - completely voiced, stat based, no problems whatsoever.  Of course you know what your character is going to say which is MUCH better than 'Sarcastic' which is usually some childish nonsense

The main issue in F4 is just being railroaded - most of what you say doesn't matter - you end up nuking Boston in most of the endings which is just insane
    Yeah agreed. You‚Äôre playing a character they created ‚Äî not making your own. There‚Äôs no way to really make the story yours
    The tragic box of "Yes" and take the job, "No" the job will be here later, "Sarcastic" I'll do the job but not because you told me to, or "Ask more questions "
Same, I really didn‚Äôt enjoy anything to do with the main storyline, alternate start mod is a necessity for me playing Fallout 4. I already don‚Äôt like it when the game lacks dialog options for a certain kind of character I‚Äôm RP‚Äôing so giving that character automatic audio prompts didn‚Äôt add to my experience at all.
    Even alt starts only go so far, the game is heavily tied to the main story and most side quests are radiants from a faction.
        Agreed, but at least with the alternate start you can disable a few of the bigger changes that are tied to factions. Sim Settlements does a better job of providing the kind of experience I wanted from Fallout versus what BGS provided.
            Sim settlements is a great mod, I just don‚Äôt like managing settlements so it‚Äôs not for me. I respect it a lot tho.
I'm with you, the first time I played Mass Effect I was honestly shocked at how much I immediately loved playing Shepherd compared to how meh I am on the Sole Survivor. I think the other really important aspect to consider is *motion.* 

When you're in dialogue as the Sole Survivor, you're just standing there. At best, you might be swaying a little back and forth. You're making expressions (sort of), but that's literally all you're doing. 

Meanwhile, in Mass Effect when I threaten someone I pin them against a wall. If I'm doing a romance scene in Inquisition, my Inquisitor is actually kissing somebody. The animations can feel a little uncanny at times--but *way* less often than the expressions in Fallout 4, and it makes you feel less like you're just copy-pasted into the game because you're actually interacting with NPCs instead of just talking at them.
    This is a problem I‚Äôve noticed in all Bethesda games. Never noticed it all that much when I was younger but all the games where the characters feel so alive are in stark contrast
FWIW the biggest problem is that it‚Äôs not as easy as FO3/NV to fast scroll through the text. Drives me bonkers, I don‚Äôt want to listen to them. They speak way too slow.
    You can totally still skip. Just use the full dialogue interface
    Why don't you just read the subtitles then skip ahead?
        I‚Äôm on Xbox‚Ä¶unlike FO3/NV, the subtitles don‚Äôt ‚Äúlock‚Äù when you advance them. So it‚Äôs not like, hit A get all the words, hit A again to advance, hit A to get all the words‚Ä¶instead you hit A and get all the words but then the character keeps going to the next dialog. It‚Äôs easy to miss something and then you need to make a choice without knowing what choice you‚Äôre making. Don‚Äôt know how to describe it better üòÇ
    On PC it's just the down arrow key.  No idea about consoles though.
I think the issue is that the amount of time and resources that they diverted for the voiced protagonist could've been used better elsewhere. Like making more interesting places on the map that weren't just raider shooting galleries or half-assed settlement locations.... Or making better quests that weren't infinitely repeated.... Or even making the main quest have more choices and outcomes. It's just not financially feasible (at least for an open world Bethesda game) to have a fully fleshed out dialogue system with a VP AND have everything else that usually comes with a Bethesda game be up to the same standards as the previous game.
    You‚Äôre totally right 

The settlement system also took time away from making better dungeons and storylines (although I still liked it)
I think Courtney Taylor did a great job. The rare occasions where she swears ‚Äúyou mercenary motherfucker!‚Äù Are gold
Gentle reminder that not everyone plays a male pc.

Next time you might want to specify in the title that you are talking about Nate specifically
What you sound like:

‚ÄúI hate playing this cowboy in a Western setting.  If you‚Äôre going to give me a voice, don‚Äôt give me a cowboy voice.‚Äù  - the OP after buying Red Dead Redemption 2. 

Seriously kid you‚Äôre bitching that a game that showed the protagonist as a dad in Boston in the trailers has you playing as a dad in Boston.

‚ÄúFO4 characters voice isn‚Äôt raspy enough and I can‚Äôt figure out the character creator, 0/10‚Äù.   - the OP
    Mocking someone for having an opinion is worse than having a 'wrong' opinion.  

The fact is that Bethesda did box players in on a game that is supposed the be all about player agency.  In many ways this felt like you have *less* real choice than you had in previous titles, and the voice acting is a legitimate part of that issue.

Don't get me wrong, I still play the heck out of it, but it feels less like Fallout than previous titles, with less meaningful choices or ways to define your own character.
        It‚Äôs a complete myth that FO4 forces you to be a heroic character.  

I see posts all the time complaining that you‚Äôre forced to do Preston‚Äôs radiant quests or join the Minutemen, even though you‚Äôre given the option to either ignore Preston or tell Preston ‚Äúno‚Äù when he asks you to help or join the Minutemen. 

You can be a psychopathic dickhead and raid the Commonwealth.  You can nuke Far Harbor.  You can genocide the synths.  You can blow up the Prydwen with all the child squires on board, you can blow up the Institute without evacuating the scientists, you can demand tribute from farmers for the BoS, you can sell fridge boy to slavers, you can shoot your own son dead the second you meet him. 

There‚Äôs plenty of player agency in FO4 and I‚Äôm tired of lazy ass people regurgitating the same flawed bullshit complaints falsely stating otherwise.
            Believe it or not, a bunch of us have opinions you don't agree with.  Calling people names like "lazy ass" for "regurgitating" what they think about a game isn't going to convince anyone, it isn't impressive, and frankly makes the internet the the unpleasant place it often is.

You don't have to agree with my take.  Hell, you don't have to do anything.  But if you'd rather harass people for having an opinion you disagree with than have honest and respectful conversations about a franchise that most of us here actually love, then you are the problem.  Not OP,  not me, and not someone who got their opinion from a reddit post as opposed to the hundreds of hours I've enjoyably wasted zigzagging the commonwealth and the island (not as fond of Nuka world, beyond Red Eye) in survival mode while building my post apocalyptic dream home.

I won't be pursuing this thread by further, because bluntly there is nothing to engage with: I can't be sure if you're attempting to be a bully, gatekeep, or just troll people into arguments, and candidly I don't really care, as no matter which I don't think you'd engage in any more pleasant or reasonable discourse than you've shown so far.  But assuming you actually want to share the fandom with other fans and engage, then I would recommend in the future coming at people from a kinder and more respectful angle and make our shared spaces better for it.
                All that word salad just to say, ‚ÄúI care way more about feeling like I am right than I care about facts.‚Äù

Bye bye!
It's especially jarring if you try to do an evil run.
    You can‚Äôt!! You‚Äôre just too goofy
        You go and try to make the hardest looking mfer possible and then they open their mouth!
I feel like he overly emotes to the point where it's obviously fake
My problem is they always hire someone who does The Voice Actor voice. You know the one. Nobody sounds like this except someone who‚Äôs talking into a microphone for a living.
i don't like the male voice actors in the games you mentioned lol. no voice is 8/10 times better for me if there are still dialogue options.
Honestly, I didn't mind the player character voiced that much, even when roleplaying. One thing where my imagination gets always stuck is voiced. I cannot imagine a voice, I can only recall some existing one and not very well. I have also this problem when reading. When someone is described as having a "raspy voice", "contraalto" or "husky voice" I usually don't imagine anything.

So I personally never minded Fo4 voiced protagonist because of the voice. What I didn't like is how it limited the dialogues. While Fo4 had a lot of dialogue, much of it was semi-linear. There wasn't that much breadth to it, like asking many questions.

Side note - while it worked great in Mass Effect, I don't consider Witcher and Cyberpunk to be much better than Fallout 4. Geralt is just grumpy all the time and V... V is just uninteresting unless agitated towards Johny Silverhand.
    I completely disagree. I thought V‚Äôs voice actor did an awesome job and fit the character I wanted to play MUCH better than Nate from FO4
I love the voiced protagonist, it's the best addition in F4 IMO. Don't know what age you are but I have certainly had to play enough games with only text or at best few lines spoken, I always wished there would come a time when even my own character would be voiced and finally it is here. If I wanted to read whole discussions and imagine them in my mind I'd read a book. 

Of course the voice actors should be chosen carefully and F4 vanilla dialogue not showing the whole line is very bad, thankfully mods corrected that very early. The female protagonist is better but male isn's bad either. Hogwarts looked to go in a nice direction by giving a tone slider to further customize voice, maybe add in an option of mute would be good for those that fon't like it, should be easy to do.
Nora (the female PC) is voiced by Jennifer Hale, the voice of FemShep, btw
    [Nora is voiced by Courtenay Taylor.](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Courtenay_Taylor) She was Jack in the Mass Effect series.
        Oh, sorry-
        I did not even realize thisüò≥ and they are both my 2/3 favorite game series'
Someone doesn't use the sarcastic option enough.
I actually find the voiced protagonist is a strength if you go in with the intention of playing as Nate or Nora, and trying to RP as them. But yeah the ability to actually roleplay your own character is not really there. I do think if you play Nate or Nora realistically(pursue the main quest first and only do other stuff if it‚Äôs convenient until a reasonable stopping point) the game is very compelling.
Yeah agreed. You‚Äôre playing a character they created ‚Äî not making your own. There‚Äôs no way to really make the story yours
The tragic box of "Yes" and take the job, "No" the job will be here later, "Sarcastic" I'll do the job but not because you told me to, or "Ask more questions "
