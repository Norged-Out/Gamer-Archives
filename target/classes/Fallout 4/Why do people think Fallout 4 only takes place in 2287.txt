[[Why do people think Fallout 4 only takes place in 2287]]


Everywhere I look, it's 2287 this and 2287 that. Fallout 4 takes place, yes in 2287, but it starts at the end of that year, it's more realistic for them to have the game end around mid to late 2288, for a change. 
People think that realistically the game could be completed in under 2 in game months. That is insane. Now canonically, would it really take only 2 months for every single thing possible in the story, dlc and all that to be completed? I don't think so.

TL;DR: The Fallout wiki states that the whole events of the game takes place in 2287 and I think it's bull, discuss




They listed 2287 because that's the only verified date, similiar to Skyrim where every source says 4E 201 (I'm currently in 4E 203 with my main char)
    Yeah, I understand now.
Generally lore won't treat protagonists like actual player-controlled characters, who fart around taking lots of time and being completionists.

As far as lore is concerned, the Sole Survivor didn't actually collect a hundred desk fans, nor build entire settlements from scratch over the course of one or two days.
If they gave out medals for pedantry, you'd be the first one honored at the banquet.
    Shit like this reply makes posting on reddit worth it.
    You deserve a medal
This true for all of their games. Nobody acts like it ONLY takes place in that year.
Yeah, I understand now.
