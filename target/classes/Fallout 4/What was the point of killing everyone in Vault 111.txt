[[What was the point of killing everyone in Vault 111]]


So at the start of the game, you can read the terminals in the vault and discover that all your neighbors are dead of "Asphyxiation due to Life Support failure."  So you think the pods began to break down over time or something like that, and go on with your quest to find your son and avenge your spouse.

Then later on when you play through Kellogg's memories, you discover that he and the Institute scientists with him thawed everyone out and only refroze you, purposefully leaving everyone else to die.  This was apparently on the orders of whoever was running the Institute at the time.  

But my question is: Why?  What was the point of deliberately killing everyone who was in cryogenic suspension in Vault 111?  They needed pre-war DNA, hence kidnapping Shaun, but apparently not a single other person in that vault besides you was worth keeping on ice in case they needed another source of DNA?

The closest we get to an explanation is Kellogg's "guess the old man didn't want so many loose ends" which doesn't explain anything at all.  Yes, the Institute seems to be made up of sociopaths, but even from the most ruthlessly pragmatic point of view, killing all the residents of Vault 111 just seems like a massive waste of potential resources.

It feels like Bethesda came up with the "Sole Survivor" name and then threw in a hasty explanation for it, even when it makes no sense in-universe.


I always wondered the same thing. It would’ve been cool to have been able to rebuild the vault with the people in it, or re settle sanctuary with them.
    It could even be an in-game explanation for why your settlements are (potentially, at least) so much better built than most of the established ones!  Some of your neighbors have the relevant skills.  Maybe the Callahans worked in construction, and Mr. Whitfield was a carpenter.
        One of them was a drug seller, Like a big time drug seller
            They would be a pillar in my community
                I mean like, Whole of Boston big
                    Yes, yes, relevant skills, we understand
                        Guy was selling to a lot of people, Probably wasn't the bomb or the radiation that killed them after the apocalypse hit
                            THE COMMONWEALTH NEEDS CHEMS, WOLF!
                                As someone who is on anti-dep, Yeah it does
                            Correct me if I'm wrong but I seem to recall no dates on the neighboring house's computer journal entries. Maybe that drug dealer is a post war one.
                                The drug dealer was one of Nate's neighbors, His terminal is the one that is connected to a locked safe in Sanctuary
                                    Right I just checked and even without dates, the dealer reference connections in the army, a potential cop under cover, definitly pre-war, my bad.
                                    Oh wow, I've never found this.
                    Heisenberg
                It's the apocalypse. Those skills transfer well. Someone has to run logistics and negotiate with the traders
                And Mama Murphy's best friend
                Thats actually funny I make jet to buy everything I own ;)
            I don't think he was one of the ones who made it into the vault, though?
                No.  If I remember correctly, the name on his mailbox is Hawthorne, which is the same name as one of the wealthy families in Diamond City.  The adventurer you meet when you first walk into the Dugout Inn is one of them.
            Nah, Nate is the biggest jet pusher in the commonwealth.
                Gotta put that fertilizer to use somehow. Easiest caps you'll ever make.
            Mistuh White, we gotta cook!
        Deffs better then the other group of neighbors, those guys try ro eat your skin.
        This goes especially well with all the promotional imagery of 111s door stating "societal preservation vault"
        I think all the neighbors die, they're outside the gates when you enter the vault and then near diamond city the named ghouls are the neighbors
        That coupled with sim settlements would of made the settlement system a lot more compelling
    Which would also give you a reason to actually wanna do anything with Sanctuary
        Don’t most people do stuff with sanctuary cause of Preston and gang?
            Idk, but I doubt it. They're a pretty lackluster bunch imo, despite having an actual psychic and a hodunk genius. It's also way out of the way of literally everything.
            That's the very reason I go elsewhere actually.

        How's it relevant to their power issues, though? Vault 111 has completely seperate generators from the Institute.
            Read the terminal entries. The staff were having trouble keeping the vault going from the start. Issues with the pods as well
                This is the comment I was looking for, I remmember it being actual technical problems that were preventing the facility to keep working correctly.
                    Yeah. Institute probably pushed it over the edge waking Nate and Nora up
            They're worried about the power grid holding up after 150+ years, especially if they need it running another 50+. 

Because their experience taught them it can be a problem.
    Isn’t there a line about how the rest didn’t have the thing they wanted from Shaun?
    I'm sure there's a mod for that 😂
Could be as simple as that the vault was starting to run low on cryogenic resources, and so they prioritized just keeping their backup. 

It hardly will have been about the name, though. Killing off everyone else tied up a loose end for Bethesda, which is the likely (main) reason they did it. Keep them alive, and a lot of players would expect being able to thaw them out at some point, they’d realistically have to do *something* with the other vault dwellers. Easier to kill them off, which also gives the vault and the start of the game (as well as whomever did this) a much more sinister vibe.
    So when Kellogg says "old man" he is actually referring to Todd Howard.
        "And the reward for that Vault run was horse-armor. HORSE-ARMOR!!! Who does that?!"

        how/where? not arguing, genuinely curious
            There's a note in Overseer's log about hiccups in the system thawing people early, and concern about how long the systems will work after they evacuate. Combine that with the Institutes fanatical power conservation efforts until Phase 3. 

The only statement is about "loose ends" but that's Kellogg talking and he'd be concerned about tying up loose ends much more than the scientists, and he's obviously not tying them all up as you survive. 

So when you consider the scientists made sure to shut down all the pods they didn't need, the power issues at the institute, and the known hiccup in the system with the overseer concerned about how long the pods will last (not power related, but an issue) and it's been 150 years most without maintenance (there's radroaches in the reactor by the time you wake up).

There's also Shaun's answer about why re-freeze you specifically, comments about how long the power has been an issue, and specifically that they killed the residents by turning off the power. 

Take it all together, it's the most likely explanation, they do definitely imply that's what happened.

Edit: I also feel like there's a few more conversations in the Institute that lead that way, but I can't remember the specifics. There's a few interesting tidbits in there that confirm things, like why Nora can fight the way she does if you talk to everyone.
            for me, it’s the most logical conclusion given the info provided hah i guess it’s a bit of contextual storytelling.
    Then why not release the rest into the wasteland? Kick them out, lock the Vault door, and watch what they do. Y'know, for science.
    Something to consider is that, The vault does have termianl entries that say that th epods do dispose of any body placed into them, Which si why there are some empty ones, As they where sued to dispose of bodies
        There's absolutely no terminal entry that says that.
            There actually is a line in the Overseer's instructions that reads "Unused cryogenic pods are the preferred method for cadaver disposal."
                I feel that's more so corpses don't rot, not that the pod itself is designed to kill you
            Once all residents have been sealed into their preservation chambers dispose of any detainees. Vault entryway must remain sealed under any circumstances. -Overseer Terminal
                Detainees are people that have been held for jumping the gate. 

That doesn't mean the people in the tubes.
        r/ihadastroke
            I had that once, Painfull
How else was i supposed to get the cool name sole survivor, it had to be done for that rep bruh lol
    Maybe your settlement can be attacked at somepoint and everyone else is killed while you were looking for shaun and you were the sole survivor. So you establish the minute men to protect settlements to prevent it from happening again. It could even be tied to quency where you and Preston bond over both losing basically everyone in your old settlement.
    Maybe:

you wake up, Kellog steals the kid, everyone realizes they're going to die and people start to fight back

Your character realizes:

(strength) they can fight their way out

(Perception) there's a hidden passageway to hide in  

(Endurance) they can take a couple of hits but push their way through it out of the vault

(charisma) they can talk their way out of a hostile confrontation and into a secret way out

(Intelligence) there's a cryo-gun in the overseer's office and they can make it work

(Agility) they should just run the fuck away really fast

(Luck) or they're just lucky

And at the end, it turns out that the institute burns the place down / nukes it / captures everyone leaving you the sole survivor. Y'know... like a role-playing game would do.
        Fallout was gold. These days we have leveled enemies and weapons in action-adventure open-world games and they call it RPG (ehm Assassin's Creed, witcher, Hogwarts Legacy, ...)

At least fallout let's me disarm a nuke or fuck over a town if I please.
"Why would you even do that?" could by the motto of the institute. Creating supermutants, replacing random people with synth, and so on. The institute seems determent to do all kinds of evil stuff for no reason just because the game needs that stuff to happen. So yeah, it really is just bad writing. Personally I always considered the writing to be the worst part of an otherwise great game.
    It's crazy how slight tweaks to the institute could have made them interesting.  Even something as small as a not stupid evil motivation could easily make the faction interesting.

Dima from far harbor is what the institute should have been
        The Institute ends up basically doing every possible wrong thing and it's honestly quite annoying.
        It feels like the devs were working off a first draft from the writing team.
            I feel like they just went with generic b movie scifi villains.  They needed a good twist like actually replacing people to stop some other larger scope problems the other factions ignor or aren't capable of dealing with.
                To stop the spread of some new strain of pre-war plague or something. Something close to origins of FEV, that was originally developed no as a "super soldier serum", but a way to stop the disease.

I believe that plague was the central part of cancelled Van Buren, if I am not mistaken.
                    Yeah that was the ultimate plot.  The pc was a carrier and would infect every settlement they encountered while the bad guys chasing you were trying to quarantine the plauge.

The ending had the pc having to pick the places the cure would go while nuking the rest iirc.

I also like the setup for 76 with the scorched plague.  It's backstory is more interesting than most games main quest and it's a shame bethesda didn't go with it as 76s main story instead of cleaning up the mess
                        Not exactly. Creating a cure for plague was a separate sub-plot. It was the automated and malfunctioning prison system that was trying to bring you and other prisoners back. You needed all of them back yourself to deactivate it.

Bad guy was a mad ex-NCR scientist monitoring you actions and willing to bombard the living crap outta USA.

Final decision - pick an area to sacrifice using BOMB space station (same as one if FO76's crater) as you were too late to stop the launch.

In essence, that scientist became a prototype for Father Elijah from Dead Money.

With some adjustments, Van Buren could work as a perfect New Vegas prequel, given a lot of characters!/events/locations/factions are still mentioned inNew Vegas.

As for FO76, I still wish it was a proper SP spin-off. It had a huge potential and in most aspects I still like it more than FO4.
                            They used some of the Van Buren plot for Fallout 76, and some in the New Vegas Lonesome Road DLC.

The mad scientist was deliberately trying to spread the plague, since this was the only way to raise the automated 'alert' level so he could unlock the BOMB satellites.    His motivation was essentially the same as Ulysses in Lonesome Road - he wanted to wipe away the existing societies to start again from scratch.
                > I feel like they just went with generic b movie scifi villains.

That's because they are, it's the only way to actually advance technology.  See my [theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/11ohbon/comment/jbtbu3m/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) above...
        The institute has reasons for what they do. Don't listen to people who don't pay attention.
            What are those reasons?
                The institute sends super mutants to the surface to keep it destabilized. A unified surface brings in a threat to the institute (just look at the minutemen or brotherhood or railroad who are all unified factions that can take on the institute). It also allows the region to remain relatively stagnant, allowing the institute free reign of resources.

They also replace people for political reasons. Like mcdonough. Or to oversee projects. Like roger Warwick.
                    Lmao, the only reason they're a threat to the institute is because the institute is killing and replacing random fuckin people. It's not exactly a chicken/egg situation.
                        Yes. They're imperialists. Empires/imperialists tend to create enemies.
                            No they're not, they're isolationists. They want nothing to do with the surface, by their account. So why do they keep doing things to make the surface hate them?
                                Because they are the Think Tank played (somewhat) straight.  A lot of the things they do have no other purpose than to be weird, directionless science experiments.
                                There are different forms of imperialism. Remember when the u.s. said they were entering an isolationist phase and still conquered islands and such?

>So why do they keep doing things to make the surface hate them?

Because they *want* to be hated. /s

They require resources. Just like every society. So they do what they can to keep those resources out of everyone's hands but theirs.
                                    They're really not imperialists, Shaun literally says they want to wait for the surfacers to die out. And iirc the only outside resource they ever needed was the mass fusion generator, before that they were self sufficient. Occasionally they recruited scientists from the surface. But we never see them gathering resources.

Imo the biggest problem with the Institute's motivation is why they made the synths. They say they're working on humanity's evolution, which would imply they want synths to replace humans. But if that's true, why do they deny synth sentience and use them as slaves?
                            I think people just weren't in the mood for an Ivy League Enclave.
                                they're not like the enclave.
                                    No? A technologically superior pre-war holdout group that is comically evil when it doesn't benefit them at all and thinks of all human life outside their small community as expendable, and wants to perpetuate the worst of the pre-war culture that caused the war in the first place. And their primary interest in the player character is due to their genetic purity. That doesn't remind you the tiniest bit of the Enclave?
                    > just look at the minutemen or brotherhood or railroad who are all unified factions that can take on the institute

Because the institute are objectively evil because of their constant actions, you're saying the reason they do their evil actions is because of the consequences of their evil actions
                        ...no, they do their actions because they're evil. but they do have reasons that aren't "oh we're evil". sending super mutants to the surface isn't "we're evil" it's "we don't want anyone to be able to unite against us".
                            Are you trying to say that intentionally creating murderous mutants to send to terrorize people isn't evil?
                                It is. But their *reasoning* is *not* "we are doing it because we are evil". They do not think they are evil. They *justify* it or have different reasons for it.
                                    Dude nobody is saying the Institute doesn't self rationalize their stupid evil tendencies. People are saying they would prefer is there was actual nuance instead of stupid evil. Personally I would have preferred an Institute that has screwed up BECAUSE they are trying to help the surface without interacting with it. Would have been interesting where you spend almost the whole game expecting some Cabal of evil mad scientists just to arrive and find out they are just way out of the depth.
                                    If as you say their justification is to prevent people uniting against them, then it makes zero sense, because the whole reason why factions like the minutement are uniting against them is BECAUSE what they're doing is evil.
                    I cant believe you are being downvoted for talking actual lore.

Im with you my man
                        Because this fanbase hates the lore and likes to make up their own.
                            Lmao man, I'll be honest, everyone knows the Institute justifies it themselves. The justification is all ass cause none of it makes sense. You seem to fail to realize that just because the writing gives a reason doesn't automatically make it good. 

This is why people say the writing is poor, cause sure, the Institute says they have reasons, but when you scrutinize them, you realize the reasons make no fucking sense. **You've also failed to acknowledge that the Institute's goal is to help the Commonwealth and use science to better the post war world**. 

That's something they establish to you once you become leader of the institute. So let's breakdown some of their actions and see how well does it serve the goal mentioned above. 

They made supermutants to destabilize the area so that no one would oppose them. Okay, but why exactly? The Institute themselves have stated they were focused on their research and advancing it, but they clearly don't have plans for world domination. Why do they *need* to destabilize an entire region? How does that serve their goals in research? They state they want to make a better world, one more similar to the pre-war Era, but then they create an entire faction of super mutants who then actively ruin the Commonwealth? 

Even then, how does fucking over other factions hurt them? The altruistic minute men could have been used to meet the goal of making the Commonwealth better. The Railroad wouldn't have needed to exist had they adopted a less blatantly brain dead outlook on synths. "Let's create synths who can act, feel, and be human but oh, they just aren't human to us!" The only faction that would seriously oppose them is the BoS yet the super mutants weren't a problem for them. The BoS are outsiders, they didn't have a real establishment in the Commonwealth til the event of Fallout 4. So the release of super mutants just fucked over the only factions that could have worked with them, and also just fucked over the Commonwealth incredibly. Not to mention that it makes their synths ' job of finding and salvaging significantly harder now. Like, creating super mutants was by far the dumbest thing they did cause it's like dumping a bucket of soap to clean a spill. Sure itl clean the spill, but now there's a bucket of soap you need to clean up. 

Kidnapping people is also fucking bizarre because again, it makes no sense. What's the end goal? Sure, you can argue they kidnap political figures but it's not even that. We see that they straight up kidnap random ass people too and replace them. Tell me, what purpose **that serves the Institute 'a goals** does kidnapping a random farmer do? They argue that they actually are taking valued individuals which makes even less sense. Why would you risk exposing your secret organization by taking in a bunch of randoms and then replace them? You literally had an entire vault of frozen folk, some of which were alive, and killed them. Even then, they had the ability to create sentient beings with potentially mechanical skillets. **Why would you not use the fucking intelligent robot beings to cover any logistical internal staffing?**

Again, the Institute would have been fine had they been openly more evil with their ambitions. But no, you meet them and they mostly just want to continue their research. What they *do* and what they *want* fail to align, hence why people say that the Institute is a shallow, immoral organization.
                                >You've also failed to acknowledge that the Institute's goal is to help the Commonwealth and use science to better the post war world

...no. It's not. Their entire questline involves them getting the necessary requirements to have their own power independence and thrive *underground* while they leave the surface in squalor because they see it as an irredeemable hell.

I...am not sure i want to waste my breath on the rest of your comment after this. Honestly.
                                    If they plan on thriving underground, why did they destabilize the surface?
                                    >...no. It's not. Their entire questline involves them getting the necessary requirements to have their own power independence and thrive underground while they leave the surface in squalor because they see it as an irredeemable hell.

Except that's not their only goal. They straight up tell you they want to "help the Commonwealth" or that the "Commonwealth will have nothing to fear," at times. This is why I said they are poorly written. Their goals are that they want to help the Commonwealth but also they want to stay isolated away from it cause they view it to be unredeemable. They think the people are savages yet they take them or experiment on them. They believe that their brand new synths can be used to replace human beings yet somehow view them as if they were still bumbling, obvious robots that can't at all be anything resembling human.

Father himself states that the Institute is trying to redefine mankind. What does that even mean if they also view their human like creations as not human whatsoever. Not to mention that Father will actually have the Institute form Public relations if you can convince him.

This is also a tendency shown by the game that the Institute fails to consolidate a single goal because they don't genuinely have a solid goal to reach. 

Even then, their goal of staying underground and being independent is still not at all aligned with their actions. Why do they want to stay away from everybody if they actively antagonize people? Why release super mutants into the area that makes things worse for everyone involved and is a super huge risk? Why not just do what needs to be done cause we actively don't see *any* benefit for the Institute in replacing people at all. Sure, they can act as spies, but **why do they need spies in the first place? They have synths who can replace humans, so why don't they just integrate them into societies rather than kidnapping people like a comic villain**? They can make their own super synths that are super human that would obviously, and so clearly be able to become incredibly well-respected in places like Diamond City yet they choose to just steal people, turn them into super mutants, and make a whole ass new synth to replace them? 

Even then, their replacements are genuinely ass considering how often people notice it.

If they want to just be left alone, why do they actively not try to do that? Had they just done everything silently, nobody would have known about anything. They have all the resources to create their own army, gorillas, and humans yet they somehow didn't opt to just, not do things the easy way? It's supposed to show that the Institute is full of a bunch of narcissists and cynics, but at the same time it just makes the Institute incredibly incompetent. If their main goal was independence, why are they actively making themselves known to the world and also choosing to piss them off rather than work with them? There's a difference between thinking the world above is unsalvageable and another to commit mass murder.

None of it makes sense because the two things we hear about what the Institute wants doesn't match their actions. They want to stay secluded and do their own thing? Then why do the actively antagonize people outside causing ire against them and thus leading to their downfall? Why do they kidnap people and experiment on them to make super mutants? Why make super mutants and actually make the job of salvaging worse by letting them take over multiple areas of the game? This is made worse considering they literally have the most secure entrance before the Sole Survivor comes in. They are virtually untouchable yet they keep acting as if they aren't and proceed to make the most absurd evil decisions that guarantee that the Commonwealth wants them dead. 

They also tell you they want to help the Commonwealth and obviously what they do doesn't at all align with that nonsense. 

So both goals that have been interpreted by the community (because again, the Institute is a walking narrative mess on heels that is forced to be comically evil yet somehow incredibly incompetent) fail to at all align with their goals. 

Also yeah, somehow hitting enter just sent the comment for whatever reason lmao.
                            How would anyone unite against the institute if no one knows they exist and the only way in is a teleporter? In what way are they threatened? And before that they were at risk of what? The minute men becoming a major player, the only unambiguously good faction? Wouldn't their whole plan would have made more sense to help the minute men and then leverege the favors for power?
                                >How would anyone unite against the institute if no one knows they exist and the only way in is a teleporter? In what way are they threatened?

...the railroad and brotherhood and minutemen all fought against the institute without knowledge of their base or teleportation. The minutemen even was a force to reckon with against the institute at one point.

However, the unification doesn't have to be directly threatening. It could make it harder for the institute to replace key people. Or get parts for their projects. Etc.

>Wouldn't their whole plan would have made more sense to help the minute men and then leverege the favors for power?

Why would they help the minutemen? Who went against them in the past?
                                    We are back to the circular logic problem of the institute. Everyone hates them because they were assholes and then that justifies them being assholes. If they didn't suck and stayed to true to either goal, helping the wasteland like you get told when you take over. Or two just stayed underground and worked to establish their own power grid. Neither of those goals require the super mutants, neither requires kidnapping. And as someone else said, why even make synths this smart? Just stop like one generation ago and they would have largely avoided the whole robot slavery problem but still had a free labor pool. Most of the time it seems the best explanation for why, is that it seems the writers needed it that way, and that's bad writing
                            Indeed, i stopped correcting people here becuase they literally refuse actual lore with source, and rather upvote shitty theories like the player being a synth or pretend that NV is a flawless game.

    >"Why would you even do that?"

Hm... About to meet Shaun in my latest playthrough, going to try imagining he inherented the place from Cave Johnson and see how that feels.
        Science isn't about why. It's about WHY NOT!
    The super mutants and replacements do have a certain amount of logic to them, though.  They were studying the FEV, and had gotten to the point where Virgil was able to create a cure for at least the one specific strain of the disease that he was infected with.

As for the replacing people with synths, that seems to have two reasons: 
1) Replacing influential people gives them control over the settlements that are large and well-established enough to maybe become a threat in the future. 
2) Simple expedience. Want a site on the surface to test your new strain of bioengineered pumpkins?  Replace the farmer with a synth, that's obviously the easiest way. They never thought they could make a synth that doesn't look like anyone, send him up to the farm with the seeds, and tell him to say he's a farmer looking for work, because they really don't see the people on the surface as human beings.
    The supermutants could be explained as the Institute not carrying about what happens to the surface, which they make evidently clear by isolating themselves. Instead of wasting resources trying to kill the mutants, they can just teleport them to the surface and let them roam. This has the side effect of keeping the Commonwealth weak, as the Institute rightly fears that the surface could breach into the sanctuary that is the Institute. By keeping the Commonwealth disorganized and controlling how the population thinks and acts, the Institute can guarantee themselves that no threat will come to them so long as it’s kept that way.

Replacing people plays a key role in observing the Commonwealth and making sure that nothing is being planned. By hiding amongst the populace as another face, they can influence people by using that synth to spread what the Institute wants. They’ve already have Diamond City under control, and thus have reduced threats to them significantly.

Although it’s their fault that the surface fears them, they are a bunch of self-righteous scientists that believe what they’re doing is for the good of everyone. They believe the surface is lost and only good to test experiments out in the field and for resources, and probably believe that after the Broken Mask incident that the Commonwealth would never accept them, leading to the CPG massacre. They themselves cannot be wrong, it’s the outside who is wrong and hindering humanities progress. That is the attitude the Institute has and why they continue to do the things they do.
    Because "SCIENCE!" isn't scientific, it's wacky mad scientist shit.  If you stick with logic, you aren't doing "SCIENCE!" and don't get the crazy techno super effects.  This is why every group that advances technology invariably creates some horrible side effects.  The Brotherhood understands this on some level, and fights against it.

Seriously, that's my theory re a lot of Fallout.  Their "technological advancements" are actually magical techniques based on the PERCEPTION of technology, pop culture, etc.
    I think the reasoning for replacing people was to gain Intel on the commonwealth? Like spies? Which also seems redundant since they apparently have bird security cameras all over the place.

So yeah, they do unnecessary evil stuff for no reason other than "You wouldn't be able to understand."
    F4 didn't have the best writing.  Especially the institute.
    To be fair, “Why would you even do that?” Could also be the motto of Vault Tech, Mr. House, the Enclave, Big MT, and even a bunch of historical R&D wings of government agencies in real life.
        Technically, if we consider cancelled Fallout games such as Van Buren, didn't VaultTec have ties with the Enclave? Wasn't collecting data on humans' survivability in extreme environments the purpose of their experiments to use later for colonising a new planet?

Big MT went awry due to robo-brain tech for life extension being rather unstable. Scientists literally went mad.

What's wrong with Mr. House? Besides his inability to accept status of NCR citizen and actually try working things out with BoS, his logic is pretty sound.
    That could be said of most IRL experiments, and both the FEV, Synths and killings that the Institute does is explained by the leader and the companion that you get w/institute, they want to cleanse the surface to be the “better” humans, the problem is, if there is no lower humans to experiment on, what’s the point?
    And thank god Emil Pagliarulo left so no more games can be tainted with his god-awful writing.
        >Emil Pagliarulo

Um, he's still there or were you being facetious? He is the lead designer on Starfield. Unfortunatley.
            At Feb 3rd I heard news that he was leaving, but now I can't find it anymore
    I think a lot of people could stand to look into the sort of senseless, barbaric atrocities that have been committed under the pretense of "science" in the real world.

If anything about the Institute's clinical indifference to the lives of wastelanders and their willingness to kill them for no practical reason is unrealistic, it's that they didn't go *far enough*.
    That is literally the Institute's whole thing. Science for no reason beyond science
    Just because you don't like the way they're written doesn't mean it's bad. The institute is consistent with their depiction of being incompetent at everything that doesn't fall into any scientific field. Kellogg even questions the decision of killing the rest of the people. People making stupid mistakes isn't bad writing, it makes them feel more real.   
The institute acts exactly how an underground science dictatorship that's been isolated for 200 years would act.
    ...the game literally has reasons for why the institute does what they do. You literally just have to pay attention. The most basic of audience participation.

You have no platform to criticize if you must lie or misconstrue or just be ignorant because you refuse to participate as an audience member.

The fact my comment that is calling out people who don't pay attention is heavily downvoted is sad.
        ....wow dude.  I'm not the OP or who you're commenting on.  But I think I speak for everyone when I say.  We appreciate your passion.  That's super cool that you liked it so much and understood it so well!  Sounds like you had a great experience with Fallout 4.  So did I!    


But he's allowed to have his opinion about the story.   That's kinda how it works.  We can all experience different things in our own ways and have our opinions on it.  And that's ok.  


It doesn't take away from your experience, your enjoyment of the story...or your opinion of the story.
            >But he's allowed to have his opinion about the story

Sure. But an ignorant opinion (because they refuse to pay attention) is not a valid one.

You might as well say i'm allowed my ignorant opinion on, say, shawshank redemption. Didn't pay attention to it, but i *could* say it is the worst movie to ever exist and is poorly written. How is it poorly written? Idk, i didn't pay attention. That's not how this works, though. If you refuse to pay attention, but then act like the writing **is** flawed...your claim is invalid.
                Or....he just views it differently then you.  and he didn't like explanations that maybe you did.  Or things that felt like they fit like a glove to you....felt forced to him.  that's kind of how differences of opinions work.  Hell...it's given you something to talk about this morning/eevening, so aren't differences of opinions beneficial?
                    Mr. Benjamin_Starscape is being really aggressively argumentative all over the post.  Not just disagreeing with people, but calling everyone with a differing opinion "ignorant" like it's on his word of the day calendar.  And when someone offers a rebuttal to his points, he ignores the point they made to call them stupid a second time.
                        I'm not a guy. And i'm not calling anyone ignorant. I'm calling their "opinions" ignorant because it shows they didn't pay attention.
                            Sorry for assuming, I made an educated guess since you have a masculine screenname.  But male, female, both, or neither, you're still being *really obnoxious* on this post.
                                all i'm asking for is that people pay attention to the media they consume. if that's obnoxious, sue me.
                                    You're assuming that *your* interpretations are the only correct ones, and *everyone* who came to a different conclusion than you simply didn't "pay attention."  And complaining that the fandom has gotten dumb because some people are disagreeing with you.

Do you not see how that's obnoxious?
                    Ignorant opinions aren't beneficial. They only spread ignorance and make the audience dumber. This fanbase has gotten dumber. Audiences overall have gotten dumber. Gamers as a whole do not pay attention.

You shouldn't let ignorance go under "it's just an opinion". It breeds ignorance.
                        You seem like the kind of guy that thinks you need an especially high IQ, such as yours, to understand the nuances of Rick and Morty.
                            I'm not a guy, iq is not a good measure of intellect, and i don't find rick and morty nuanced or funny or good.

You made an awful lot of assumptions that were all wrong. If saying you should pay attention, the most basic ask for the audience, feels like you need a high iq...idk what to really tell you.

Because literally all i'm telling people is to *pay attention*.
                                It was a joke that clearly sailed a few thousand feet above your head but alright.
                                    Or it just wasn't a good joke.
                You are allowed your ignorant opinion on Shawshank. You are allowed to have any opinion on anything you want. That’s the neat thing about opinions.
                    >You are allowed your ignorant opinion on Shawshank

No! No, i am not. In that example i refused to pay attention and then criticized it. That is *not* okay. Criticism through ignorance is not criticism.
                grow the fuck up.
                    Yes. *i'm* the one who needs to grow up.
                        yes, you are. you're acting like a petulant child.
                            I mean they are almost certainly 11
                            ...because i don't like comments that spread misinformation due to the commenter not paying attention?
                                Bro is calling opinions misinformation lmao it's not that deep dude it's a video game
                                    video games are a form of art. the same as books, movies, and paintings. saying that the game has bad writing based on nothing other than you not paying attention *is* misinformation.

it's also, again, not an opinion. it's just ignorance. plain ignorance. which would easily be fixed by the most basic of audience participation...paying attention. it's not some huge ask.
    The idea that the writing is the worst part of a Fallout game would make people in 1998 laugh at you
    yeah that why in my head the insitute ist the most evil of all "bad guys" in the fallout series.

 The Master had a good reason to do what he did. that it was flawed yes but he had a plan.

Same with the Fallout 2 Enklave.the probly the second on the Most Evil People List in Fallout.

The Fallout 3 Enklave is well divide the Part Loyal to Henry Eden is bad as bad as the Fallout 2 Enklave. the Paert Loyal to Autumm is less Evil becuas he Hates Edens Plan to kill all People.

Falllout New Vegas Bad the Legion is well a Good Place 3 on the Bad Guy list. the have a Plan but really only for the Short term.when Ceaser Dies the Legion Dies.
    Always thought super mutants were a side effect from scientists trying to make radiation immune humans. 

As for replacing people with synths weren't they recording/spying on people gathering information.
    Replaying FO4 after a long break reminded me of just how irritating it is that the super mutants are in the Commonwealth, especially with *how* *many of them* there are. I know the Institute was trying to sabotage the surface world as much as possible, presumably so they could shake their heads sadly and go "see? synths are the only solution :(", but creating super mutants just doesn't make any bloody sense. 

And then! They're also on Far Harbor!! Somehow!!!!! Bethesda please you don't have to shoehorn them in everywhere just because they were in DC and the Mojave, especially when they have absolutely zero interesting quests except for Strong. I really hope they're not in the next game :/
    Well you know how long they have been trying to make BOS the best they can be. In canon. First games made them mystical, later they realized lots of future plot likes could be the end of the BOS. So it makes sense why we get a story of a spinter of the BOS becoming badasses and claiming the mantel. The institution being insane is likely a justification to help them look better.
I always just assumed you were important because your DNA would have been similar to Shaun's so they wouldn't have had to start from the beginning if something had went wrong. Turning off all other pods would have been naturally just to save as much energy as possible to your pod and not waste it on others.

What doesn't make sense to me is why would the institute need clean prewar DNA, couldn't they just have used their own DNA since isn't theirs just as clean as Sole Survivor's?
    In the game it states that despite being isolated, radiation still managed to seep through and effect their genes…_somehow_. So the only non-mutated genes were the frozen pre-war vault-dwellers.
        Which is especially funny when you consider that as Sole & family entered the vault a nuke went off so close to them that they were hit with the initial wave as the elevator descended, *and* that everything on the surfacer world pre-war most likely had radioactive contamination because none of the companies operating there were interested in making things correctly.

Hell my Sole is addicted to Nuka Quantum, which is basically what if radiation was a cool blue drink lol.
    [deleted]
        Ahh my bad, I remembered that they were in isolation since before the bombs dropped.
    I'd think the Institute folks would have CLEANER DNA than Shaun by the time Kellogg lugs him back across the wasteland to the Institute, unless they teleport directly into the main area of the vault and then back from the Institute directly. Also the Institute Lady they send with Kellog is wearing some sort of anti contamination suit when we see her.

I have an alternative game start in my head I will forever wish happened:

The Institute finds Vault 111. Look at all of that pure prewar DNA!! They're all alive, cryogenically sealed. 

Let's send a batch of our friendliest looking scientists to get into the vault. "Some of you will be risking exposure to radiation but it will be worthwhile. We're going to "rescue" all of these people from their frozen prisons!" Says the Institute Leader.

The techs enter the vault and reach the two rooms containing dwellers. 

They release the cryo pods one at a time as one person calls out the state of life support on each dweller from the main computer. If the person is marked as deceased, they are left in their pod. Anyone with deceased family members is consoled and brought out to leave for the Institute.

We see Nate/Nora and Shaun let out of their pod, and your spouse is briefed while they move down the pods. But your pod, yours is marked as deceased. Apparently the oxygen pump in your pod failed, and you can't have survived without it. Your spouse is devastated and allowed to mourn for a moment, but then whisked off to the Institute.

Time passes, days, months, years we're not sure. Suddenly your pod door malfunctions similar to the original cutscene. You wake up, confused and coughing and drop out of your pod. As you look up, the other pods are mostly open. One or two in your room are also still shut. Then as you stand shakily, the others also open. About half of the people left behind are alive like you, the rest are deceased from varying natural causes. Those who are left don't up understand what happened. How are we alive? Where is everyone else? The rest of our families?

You take the lead. Everyone calm down and stay together. We need to search the vault. You lead the NPCs through the vault, maybe they each have comments or abilities to even help reach the exit faster. Maybe one of the women has Bobby Pins in her hair she's willing to hand over and it changes her hair style. You search the rooms, read terminals, try for the cryolator but no one has the skill to pick it. 

You fight through the army of radroaches, learning through the standard terminals of details on your experiment but nothing noting your families' exit. You make it to the exit and take up the pip boy, now being given the title of Overseer by your residents. 

You bid the people to exit. There isn't any food down here there's barely any water, and staying risks waiting for more rad roaches to invade and potentially overwhelm. 

This brings a small argument up amongst the residents but one of them finally shouts "If our families are out there, then they're up above damnit! They aren't in here! If we want to see them again, we risk the elevator."

Everyone comes back to their senses and gathers in a circle on the platform, just like when you went down. You step in the center, and gain your last minute prompt to edit your appearance or abilities. 

You make your choice, then the scene fades up to the surface. You've made it, and now it's time for you and your neighbors to go home.
        That would be a great premise for an AU fanfic.
            Haha yes now if only I can learn to draw people properly I'd make it into a comic
        I really like this a lot. 

But if the intro/tutorial was a second longer I'd lose my mind.
            I don't think it needs to be much longer for my idea to work. Then again most of the time I end up running into those other rooms anyway so I wouldn't have trouble spending another couple seconds picking up some friends. I guess that last cutscene with them arguing could lengthen it a little but hopefully not too much.
                Have one settler ask "do you know what happened here?!"

Then pick a dialogue option:

1: Yes, follow me! We'll find our families, I promise. [Skips tutorial, you exit straight to the elevator ride]

2: I... no. We'd better look around and figure out what's going on. [You play the tutorial/ explore the vault]

I'd play this as an alternative intro mod!
                    Yess
    Or if Shaun is so significant for his clean DNA, why not take father and mother at the same time with you, teleport them in, and then convince them to have more babies? Or just have 2 more clean sets of DNA to work off of while you rescue them?
        Adults can fight back and resist, an infant can be molded and controlled easily.
            Why would they though? In an apocalypse, the Institute offers shelter, food, and modern conveniences. And they wouldn’t know anything about them being sketchy.
    Shawn himself says that not even the institute scientists could escape all of the radiation
So the devs didn't have to deal with other people surviving, frankly.
Also who is the old man he mentions, it’s not Father as he’s still a baby at the point
    Probably the director of the Institute at that point, whoever it is.  Calling adult!Shaun "The Old Man" later was the writers trying to preserve the twist, but it doesn't make sense for Kellogg to be calling someone he's known since he was a baby and is at least 40 years younger than him "old man."
        [deleted]
            [Old man](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/old%20man) is also a common term for "a man in authority."
I'm more confused about Pipe Pistols in every locked pre-war safe.
    See also: bottlecaps
        I think Cap Collector is just magical, honestly.
    Pre war gov tried to limit population having weapons.  Older games explained you needed licenses for even owning combat armor etc so likely its those who couldn't or didn't want to go through the (likely pretty rigged) licensing system.
        But no Pipe pistols in DC or the Mojave. It's a shit retcon to explain their mistake.
            Maybe Boston just had someone actually bothering with making pipe guns which then spread all over the place.
Be honest, you just want the pleasure of thawing out Old Man Jenkins to put a bullet in him for always bad mouthing your roses.
    The bastard keeps raking his leaves onto *my* lawn!
        The shear audacity of it. Poor Cogsworth almost blew a fuse last time he did it.
Doylist: They had served their purpose, and Bethesda didn't have to program any extra stuff like unique settler interactions if they all kick the bucket before hand.

Like, we know that Bethesda has problems at times, their engine can only seem to handle at most two companions, so they probably axed them all for the sake of making it easier to boot the player directly onto the next major set piece, that is the gunfight at Concord.

Unfortunately, it leaves the Institute looking monstrous ans self sabotagingly stupid  for no reason. Do remember that Kellogg also cheats and plays the pronoun game to try and obfuscate the Big Twist.

It leads me to conclude that originally Shaun II was just Shaun, and Father was the bad guy of the plot... but everyone and their dog during playtesting figured it out, so they doubled down and pushed the twist harder, collapsing the whole story for the sake of getting ahead of the audience.

If Shaun II _was_ Shaun, then the story would have played out straightforwardly without all the fridge logic plaguong people, like why does Kellogg refer to two seperate characters sixty years apart with the same 'The Old Man' title, as well as not introducing the plot hole that the Institute had already cured aging and had effectively made baseline humanity immortal ~60 years prior, meaning the Synth III program didn't even need to exist.

Fallout 4's story is, let's be honest, really wonky.
    They killed all the other dwellers because they already had Shaun’s DNA, they kept you on ice just in case something happened to him and shut the other pods down so that all the power can be redirected to your pod. Your character is referred to as the “Backup” when you talk to father on top of the CIT
        An entire vault's worth of prewar survivors, each of them potentially useful in future, not to mention that they are already useful as is, not least of which because you already knew they weren't going anywhere, who already had strenuous Vault Tec med screenings.

The breadth and depth of ways that would be useful to a group of science nerds is too much to count.

Killing the entire vault's population, even sabotaging the ongoing cryogenics test, was not only evil, but stupid evil. It's not even 'tying up loose ends' because there were at least three additional rooms of viable dwellers worth of very useful potential candidates, to say nothing of the premium foolishness of killing them all _but_ you for sake of a backup.

You had an entire vault full of backups, and now you only have one. Way to go, Institute Director Dumbass.
            The Institute has been shown to be uncaring and xenophobic towards to surface population. Which leads to things such as massacring whole towns/vaults, which is shown throughout our own history, “war never changes”. I wouldn’t even call it stupid/cartoonishly evil because that has happened in our own history, people who think of people as lesser will just kill them because they think they’re superior. Another one of the institutes flaws is that their arrogance blinds them and makes them do stupid things, which could also explain the vault dwellers being killed. 

And the Backup needed to have the same DNA as Shaun, IIRC that was mentioned at the end of the Battle of Bunker Hill quest
                I agree with this POV in principle - the final talk with Shaun on the building where he goes "yep civilisations is destroyed look at this" and your Sole doesn't get to bring up ANY of the world they're doing to rebuild is stupid but shows how single-minded the Institute is with regards to their own superiority...

...But it doesn't explain their ultimate goal. Like at all. Do they want to retake the surface? Remain underground forever? Well then why do they keep sabotaging the surface? Why did they make super mutants? Why are they replacing surface people with synths? What's the *point* of it all? Even if you become Director there's no real explanation of their exact end goal and it's so frustrating. At least Minutemen = rebuild Commonweath, Railroad = rescue all synths, BOS = exterminate technological threats. Institute = ??????????? uhhh cool robots. Or something.
                    Yep. 'What does the Institute *want*' is the driving question of the game, and  unlike the clear and defined goals of everyone else, the Institute is this vague and hazy nebulous blob of science nerds who have spent the last two centuries peeing in everyone else's cornflakes for no clear goal or reason.

I suspect, that in much the same way the Gunners are a reskin of Talon Company, the Institute was originally going to be a reskin of the FO3 Enclave- unambiguously bad guy nazi-likes that you can mow down without guilt or remorse.

Then New Vegas came out, and people loved and still love to this day, the fact that you can support anyone and have fairly cogent arguments for all the factions, much like Daggerfall. ^(Ceaser's Legion is a bunch of losers and a dead end ideology though.)

So I imagine that Emil decided to retool the factions drastically *after* they had already started development, and that's why the Institute is so.... nebulous.
The story required you to be alone. It wouldnt help the plot to have a dozen confused people unless the become settlers in sanctary.  Its just storytelling.
    That's the meta reason.  I'm wondering what the in-universe reason for it would be.
        Thats like asking what psychopath thought it would be a good idea to put keyed locks on a first aid kit
    It could have made a fantastic scripted event if, just like the F:NV DLC Honest Hearts, the other survivors were immediately killed upon exiting the Vault or on Sanctuary. Having them promptly ripped to shreds by feral ghouls after walking into their ruined homes would have set some real stakes. Also it would tell you Codsworth is an excellent companion for combat.
Because they didn’t need them anymore I guess and you were the backup for Shaun
They were only ordered to recover the asset and preserve the one backup.

It helps shows the callousness of the Institute. They could have restored the other Pods, but that wasn't part of the mission.
A lot of the tortured attempts at explaining things would have been avoided just by having Kellogg take both Nora and the baby (or Nate and the baby) back to The Institute.  Sixty years pass and Nate gets thawed out.  He goes looking for his wife and kid.  Stuff happens.  He talks to people.  Gradually it dawns on him that a lot of time passed since he saw them taken.  He finds out that Nora passed away of old age after many years.  If we must, we could still do the whole Shaun is Father thing, if that reveal is something we can't jettison.    As for the rest of the cryo people?  They are still in cryo.  Don't have The Institute kill them.  Nate not waking them can simply be waved off as he doesn't know how to safely awaken them "for now."
I wouldn’t read too much into it, Bethesda needed to set the tone of hopelessness and isolation for the player
They were going to put the Vault-Tec guy inside and just forgot lol. Poor bastard.
Or, why did Kellogg shoot Shaun’s mom (or dad) in the head? A robot enhanced mercenary can’t wrestle a baby away from someone who just got out of cryogenic freezing?
I always thought that Kellogg revisited the vault some 56ish odd years later when he says the old man thing. And I always thought by old man, he was referring to Sean.
I mean Bethesda could’ve just as easily explained away that yours was the only one left working by the time Shaun thawed you out because of the whole backup thing. And that the other pods just broke down over time and the only reason your’s was still ok was because of the Institute interfering. Instead of making it just needlessly confusing and saying they left them unfrozen to die intentionally.
It's the Institute so the proper question is why NOT? They refroze a full spare in the form of the Sole Survivor, had spare genetic material beyond that in the form of the dead and it would take time and effort to preserve everyone and that would be much harder anyone.
[deleted]
    But the person Kellogg was referencing wasn't "Father."  Father is Shaun, it's a nickname he got because his DNA was used to make all the gen 3 synths.  At the time the other residents were thawed out and left to asphyxiate in their pods, "Father" was a six month old baby.

I think the confusion is because Kellogg refers to the director of the institute as "the old man," but he also calls adult!Shaun "the old man" sixty years later, even though it makes no sense, because the writers were trying to preserve the twist that Father was your now adult son.
        How does it make no sense? It's okay to not like the story but, seriously. They're both old men who had pretty much the same relationship with Kellogg as Kellogg physically stayed the same age. Does it actually make NO sense that he would refer to them both as the old man?
            Okay, maybe it doesn't actually make *zero* sense, but I still think it was awkwardly written to preserve the twist.  I feel like if Kellogg had called them both "the Director" it would have worked better.
                I agree that would probably have worked a bit better. I think it's only really awkward because he refers to them as "the" old man but, I don't think it's really that weird I mean being nicknamed "old man" or "the kid" is not super uncommon
The only reason why anyone does anything:

For the lulz
When they shoot your spouse, one of the scientists says "we still have one" (or something like that), so maybe your DNA is prioritized because it's close to Shaun's?

But like others have said, I think it's just to give Bethesda a reason for you to be the only one.
The Institute wanted Shaun for his Prewar DNA, that is a fact.

As to why all vault 111 was killed off besides the Player Character is probably due to being Shaun's Parent, if something Happened to Shaun medically, the closest person to help with a treatment would be the parent. The Parent would be the best case donor to Shaun, thus why kept alive.

Everyone else was not related to Shaun at all and the Institute probably did not want the Vault 111 resources being used by what the Institute thought was insignificant people and so killed all not related to Shaun to give all remaining power and resources to keep the parent alive for as long as possible.

After a while, the Parent gets woken up and we know the story after the wake up.
Well the simple explanation is they didn't know what to do with the institute. Which is why they are pure evil 50% of the time, 50% "we only do science don't judge us".
Ties up a plot point and preserves vault tech’s dark reputation. A full vault of survivors like that would be a faction in their own right.

In universe? Ties up loose ends from their perspective too, I suppose. Keeps the institute as the “purest” people. Surprises are bad for business.
It doesn’t make full sense (I’ll go in to why) but I believe *only* Shaun had DNA that hadn’t been impacted by radiation. It doesn’t then make sense why you’re kept around outside of it being a reason for your player character to make it to the events of the game. But if we take *that* as the outlier for gameplay reasons (I.E., for the games plot the parent not frozen with baby Shaun needs to live), then it makes sense as to why everybody else was let to thaw out and die. Their DNA is about as useless to The Institute as a wastelander. Once Shaun is in charge, you being alive makes sense again as he wants to preserve his parent to test them. 

While I don’t actually follow the theory (or at least, don’t think it’s canon) this would give credence to the “you play as a Synth programmed to be a parent” idea. The parents *do* die, Shaun is the only one with pure DNA, the others are all killed. Then Shaun takes over and has a synth with false memories put into Vault 111 where they wake up thinking it was all one life. 

But like I said, I don’t actually think you’re a Synth in game. I think it’s more likely that you’re kept alive as “the backup” only because you need to be alive for the games events. The way the rest of the vault is treated is likely more how you would be if there wasn’t a game.
If i had my way. I wouldve given the player the option to unfreeze everyone. Sure. Some would die and we could have a narrative explanation for why. But really thats for the game limitations.

We couldve had vault dwellers combing back to occupy sanctuary.

We kinda get something similar with concord and preston. But I think it wouldve been a better narrative to have some vault dwrllers reacting to the world rather than just the player protagonist whom is mostly silent about it. 

We later have sanctuary attacked by a second group of raiders from the corvega plant. And to show how important settlement building is for when you face the brotherhood of steel if the player chooses to go the route of the MM quests.

This is where some vault dwellers should die to drive home how hostile the environment is. 

To me, theres a small emotional impact at seeing someone meet their end after going through so much. And you start to question if unfreezing them was the right choice.
Hasty explanation and poor writing is the reason for it.

The fan theory that the power was rerouted from all the other pods to the player character's pod would have made sense, *if Bethesda had thought of it*. But they did not.
Would have been cool if 1 other guy survived and he was out and about just like you getting into trouble and you could help him whenever you crossed paths
    Or the opposite.  Its that neighbor that always hated you. He heater you, your partner, your nicer house, your nicer car, your Mr. Handy and things really popped off for him when Shaun came along and suddenly your family was the talk of sanctuary hills.  They could be the kind of antagonist that doesn't want you dead.  They want you to live in the wasteland without your partner, without your son, and without a hope of ever having your classic "American Dream" life back.
    And that guy... is the Mysterious Stranger!
There wasn’t any, the whole Shaun storyline was full of holes. I love the game over all but weirdly I thought the main plot was the worst thing about it, seemed badly thought through and inconsistent with the pacing of the game. Honestly I’d have just stripped it out and had SS as a guy who was discovering the factions of the wasteland, rebuilding it and entering into the narratives around the institute and other factions like that.
Only logical reason i could see is to keep the bloodline alive (as back up or cloning once Father gets too old), really. However, even this breaks apart since one of the parents is still killed too.

Its...a really messy concept. They could've just thawed them out, and taken them to the Institute instead or something which like you said would've been a much better use of human resources.
The institute is evil and seldom makes sense
My own personal head canon: 

The Institute didn't mean to. Everyone was put back on ice, but, over time, they broke down. Including your own. And you died.

Until Father decided to make his own replacement as Director of The Institute and made your player character, a synth, of his parent who was murdered by Kellog. 

Father admits that "letting you out" now was an "experiment of sorts," and he calls your love for him "extraordinary." Shaun wanted to craft his own replacement and get to know the parent who witnessed their spouse's murder.

He chose the witness to the murder because he knew you would want revenge, something he either wasn't capable of or looked down on or both.

There is also a terminal in either robotics or live sciences in The Institute which talks about a feature for future synths which they were currently prototyping. It describes an effect similar to V.A.T.S., an ability to slow down time to make combat calculations. You are able to target the radroaches in Vault 111 before you get your pip boy.

Sorry dude. You died. All Vault 111 residents died from a glitch or from the Institute scientists not resetting the cryo tanks correctly.

The Sole Survivor was placed there after being "born in a petri dish."
    I've heard that "the player character is a synth" theory before, but frankly I can't buy it.  There are a number of reasons, but one of the biggest is because Father wants to make you director of the Institute. The Institute is so *thoroughly* dismissive of the idea that Synths have any personhood, there's absolutely no way they would accept making a Synth the director.   

Also, if you were a synth, why wouldn't Father use your recall code and go "well, that didn't work" when you turn against them?
        See, and I find it to be the theory that makes the most sense. 

I mean, why else would Father finally release his parent, after so many years, only to leave them to wander completely unprepared and alone in a very, very dangerous environment, with almost no supplies or weapons to start out with. It would be an almost guaranteed horrible death for anybody else. Why go through that whole charade of the child synth in Diamond City with Kellogg to use as bait. Kellogg was an extremely dangerous mercenary. And true, Nate was a soldier, but Nora was a lawyer. Either way, it was an extremely risky and dangerous thing to make your parent do for no reason other then to see if your parent would get revenge. I know that Shawn wanted to get revenge on Kellogg, but I'm sure there were many, many possible ways to do so without using such a convoluted made up rescue fantasy. Unless the parent was unwittingly a synth with courser-like strength and abilities. 

My headcanon is that when they resealed the vault, they did it improperly, and everybody died. Father had some serious Daddy/Mommy issues, and daydreamed his whole life about his non-shot parent somehow surviving, and wondered just how far they'd go to rescue him, because they loved him. Then, when he realized he was dying, he needed a worthy successor. Why not kill two birds with one stone? He could create a customized synth that would basically be their parent, one that would adapt and grow more powerful. He would get to live out his fantasy of his parent's loving crusade to find him, plus a few extra loose ends tied up and a healthy dose of poetic revenge in the process. And, to top it all off, when the parent does arrive in the Institute, they meet a child replica of Shawn, while the real one observed in the other room. It was obvious that Father really, really wanted to see his fantasy of his parent swooping in and saving the child him, even if it was just observing it. Obviously, that didn't quite work out. 

As for his views on synths, it wouldn't really matter, as this synth was obviously different then the others. It was HIS. It was perfect. And it was his masterpiece and his dream made real. It could be a secret project that the majority of the institute was unaware of, or it could be that this synth was hyped up to be humanity perfected, unlike the other inferior models. But Shawn would have his answer. How it felt to be loved. And if his beloved parent would approve of his life's work, or if he would have disappointed them utterly.
    There's too much that goes against the idea of the Sole Survivor being a synth. Like where did your memories come from then? How did the Railroad and Brotherhood not notice it?

That terminal isn't in the actual game. It was deleted.
        Not sure what version you're playing. It's in my version on XBox. Every single time. They put it back in.
            Well, you're the only one. It was not in any of my playthroughs and the wiki still lists it as inaccessible. You sure you're not using mods?
                I use mods, definitely, but the terminal entry in question was actually in the original game. Some derp programmer at Bethesda forgot to "turn it on" (according to YouTuber JuiceHead). This was rectified with the release of Far Harbor in 2016. If you play the game without Far Harbor, that entry will not be there.

The wiki may list it as cut content, but it was restored with Far Harbor. Kinda makes DiMA's suggestion that you could be a synth a pretty obvious hint.
                    I have played the game with Far Harbor. And this youtuber can read minds apparently and know what unknown developers were thinking?
                        Okay, cool then. Prove me wrong. Next time you play, check out all the terminals in Robotics at The Institute.
                            I have checked all the terminals in the Institute.
                                Also checked - not there.
    It’s interesting that even Dima hints at it that you could possibly be a synth when you first talk to him in far harbor. Also think about when you first meet Shaun/father they put you in an experimental confrontation with a synth boy at around 10-12 years old to just observe and take notes.
I agree it's a little weird. My knowledge of the lore is a little fuzzy, but do they have teleportation tech at that point? If they didn't have teleportation tech at that point, then yes transporting only Shaun would be far more discreet and viable than a whole caravan of prisoners. 

Otherwise, they could've brought more personnel/synths and teleported everybody out 1 by 1 and kept them in a prepared holding cell. 

They could then secure the cooperation of the captives by using their children (i.e. Shaun, and I'm sure there were other kids in the Vault) as leverage, amongst other methods of coercion.

Does this cost the Institute more resources and complicate the retrieval operation? Yes, but I'd wager that a windfall of pre-war genetic material is absolutely worth it. 

Not to mention you could generate more pre-war/clean genetic material if required by forcing the prisoners to do... stuff. Ok it's getting a little too dark so I'll stop here.
So that your pod lasts the longest to guarantee your safety as an alternative source for compatible dna as a closely related donor, they wanted similar dna to study that isn’t corrupted by radiation so they took the baby easier to control than a full adult, I do wander why they didn’t take your spouse however.
I wish they kept your spouse alive to have as a companion later (maybe through a quest or something) it'd make customizing both people at the start more interesting
Probably to decrease the maitnence demand on the vault. Easier to keep one pod running for decades instead of hundreds.
I think that the last boss of the institute was more sadistic, hell he hired Kellogg which is kinda iffy, but he also stole a child. I think he was just an asshole.
Collapsing vault, easier to keep only blood relatives alive for organs transplants? Kill the rest to conserve power for the only 100% organs? Idk, im not a doctor. Thats just the thought that would come to mind. Wife would have lived if she didnt go to save the baby or vice versa for husband. Which obviously was understandable to not give your babies to weird people right when you wake up.
My head canon is that you were the only match for organ/blood transfer that could be used to keep Shaun alive if he got sick. They wouldn’t be able to use blood or organs from people born after the war and exposed to radiation.
Less money used for voice actors
The Institute literally does not have a written motivation. You have put probably ten times more thought into this than Bethesda at this point.
    I sure have by now. This is by far my most discussed post on reddit.
Simple. You were replaced by a synth. Anybody who would recognize you would have to die. They stole Shaun and your body. Then the synth woe up and believed he was you, but the VATS gave it away. They raised Shaun but used your DNA to create the new gens.
They felt a lil silly that day
I think many flaws within the fallout franchise mainly come from plotholes in the storyline. The main reason for those plotholes is that they are constantly trying to ensure the player plays an essential role in the main story so that they can engage more. So frequently, even when the most logical solution is for the player not to be in the spotlight, they *still* make them the ones in the spotlight. And this comes at the cost of the storyline being fluid. 

Aka, Bethesda writers want an action-packed, gut-wrenching storyline; but do not have the energy to explain why certain characters and organizations are so forgiving and accepting of a random stranger. So they devise an explanation that does not make sense to the characters or the organizations.

Don't get me wrong; the storylines are engaging. But when you stop to think about it long enough, you start to notice all the discrepancies.
Just thought of something. 

So, eventually Shaun ends up getting cancer and dying. If I'm not mistaken, cancer tends to be genetically predisposed.

So all gen-3 synths are based on DNA that's predisposed to developing very aggressive cancer.

Guess they should have thought of that before basing the entire program on the DNA of one dude. Almost as if they should have acquired a variety of prewar DNA, rather than just the one, but that would require the Institute to make a decision that makes sense and isn't pointlessly antagonistic.
Kellogg knew that Mr. Able would’ve kicked his ass he had to take care of a problem before it was one
Because of bad writing
Best Bethesda writer at work
Welcome to Bethesda writing, suspend your disbelief or insanity ensues trying to iron out every ludicrous hole in their stories.
Bad writing
because Fallout 4’s writing team sucks and it even goes all the way back to Fallout 3’s conception
My personal explanation is that the "Sole Survivor is a Synth" theory is correct, and Kellogg's memories were falsified, as Father knew that you would go poking through them. The entire population of Vault 111, including the real Nate/Nora, were all (probably) taken to the Institute long ago. Doesn't really matter who's in the pods if you can't open them up to check and have to just trust the terminal readouts. Could be the original people, or could be synths. You'd never know. Once everything was set up, he had Kellog go into the Vault, where you'd already been planted, to act out the planned scene. Your (also synth) spouse would follow programming to resist when Kellogg tried to take the infant from them, and he would follow his orders to kill them if they resist. (Or maybe the plan was to push the spouse synth back in the pod and re-freeze them, and you're the "backup" for them, not Shaun.) Then Kellogg would go about shutting down all the other pods (or at least, believing that he was, since the Institute had the ability to remotely access the cryo systems as was done when thawing you out). Father set up a scenario where you'd _believe_ you're the Sole Survivor of the Vault, that your son has been kidnapped, and that Kellogg is responsible, and then just let your programming run.
One of the many plot holes in the game. It would have been smarter if you could have  actually saved (some of) them to become your first settlers in Sanctuary.

Just one of many missed opportunities in the game.
Yeah it doesn't make much sense but nothing the Institute does makes sense. I'm pretty sure that Shaun released you remotely meaning he has some control over the system. It would have made more sense if they refroze everyone but then when Shaun released you as an experiment he decided to kill everyone else so you'd be alone. I'd say it's a better experiment to force one person into a new environment then it would be to wake up a group.
oxhorn did video on this and many others, probs they didn't want ''loose ends'' and you the sole survivor was left in the cyropod to be an experiment of shaun. Kellog wanted to kl you too and he knew you would have came for him.Bethesda has left many confusions and i guess well never know?
You probably answered your own question with the last sentence. It's a lazy dumb answer, but it's a lazy dumb narration for the game.
If you're partial to the theory that the Sole Survivor is actually a synth, it makes sense. Look at the way the game starts. A single day of memories, with impressions of a whole life of memories, but nothing we actually see. If there were survivors, they could reference memories and experiences from the SS's past that would expose the synth origin.
    And when you go to far harbor they tell you your a synth as well.
        They don't directly say it. DiMA just asks the SS if they think they are a synth.
Game ruined. Completely unplayable. Someone who's never written anything in their life found a meaningless plot hole and now no one should derive enjoyment from this video game. 

Thank you, OP, for saving us from having a small amount of joy and recreation
1. Because it’s dumb.
2. Because Sole Survivor is catchier than whatever the alternative would be
There’s no reason to get any other DNA, they all are useless, the decision was most likely left for Kellogg (he admitted that he let you live) and considering how much of a psycho he is, he just up’d and killed every one of them
If you were left with a vault full of survivors Bethesda probably thought it would distract from the main mission.  
It would have been interesting to have say 10 survivors im the vault.  You have water and power so food would be the priority.  You could have had some interesting moral choices to wipe out some local farmers for food to keep the vault fed.
Because they're ass holes, and they're a bunch of dicks, and they suck at science
The sole survivor was only useful to the institute because he was a close biological match to Shawn, so if Shawn were to die they could still do tests. The other people were basically just taking up resources as far as the cryogenic technology goes, so the institute decided to just pull the plug.
Because they didn't want loose ends. Kellogg outright states this in his memories.
    I mentioned that in my post.  And that it's a stupid, vague reason that doesn't actually explain *why* they did it at all.
        Not wanting loose ends isn't stupid or vague. We literally see what happens with *one* survivor. The institute does not like loose ends.
            But why would anyone who *wasn't* Shaun's parent and Nate/Nora's grieving and enraged spouse have been a loose end?  None of the people in the vault had any reason to act against the Institute until they gave the protagonist two really good ones.

"Loose ends" is a wallpaper explanation covering up a big plot hole.
                >But why would anyone who wasn't Shaun's parent and Nate/Nora's grieving and enraged spouse have been a loose end?

They might not. But they'd just spread more rumors the institute doesn't want.

>"Loose ends" is a wallpaper explanation covering up a big plot hole.

This isn't a plot hole. This fandom needs to learn what a plot hole is. You want a plot hole? How about caesar sending you down into the bunker instead of a frumentarii whose sole job is the exception to caesar's rules?
                    Caesar was recruiting the Courier, the only person who has access to the Lucky 38, and testing to see if they'll obey his orders.  With all your railing against people who "don't pay attention" on this post, I'm surprised you missed something so blatantly obvious.
                        >Caesar was recruiting the Courier, the only person who has access to the Lucky 38, and testing to see if they'll obey his orders.

...except the courier needs the chip for house or themself. And so caesar stupidly just hands them over the key and says "yeah bro, you got this". If isn't a test. Because his reason when asked was "i'd have to kill them".

And then, he doesn't even check after you. He just takes a tremor as evidence.

>With all your railing against people who "don't pay attention" on this post, I'm surprised you missed something so blatantly obvious.

The irony cannot be further lost on you. You literally made up a reason. What you said isn't true at all. Because, like i said, his reason is "i'd have to kill them". The courier literally can ask "why can't you just send a legionaire", there is nothing about this being a test. And he does not go check after you. He should have sent a frumentarii, the people who are allowed to touch technology.

Can't comment under my own thread because of reddit's amazing block system.

>Do you really think there was no nuance to the Hitler?

*morally*? No. Like...that shouldn't even be up for debate. Strategically? Yeah. And that's the point of my comment. Do you measure "nuance" by "moral ambiguity" or actual depth? This fanbase (and the person who told me to kill myself) use "nuance" as "morally ambiguous". Which has its place. But a faction can be morally bankrupt and still have nuance. Because the institute is nuanced and has depth.

>Finally, at least New Vegas was interesting despite its bad writing. The Institute is poorly written and boring.

New vegas is anything but interesting. The institute isn't poorly written (unless you didn't pay attention) and they're not boring. They're one of the most interesting factions in the franchise.
    I measure nuance in many ways. The problem is the institute doesn’t have strategic nuance or moral ambiguity. There’s very little rationale to anything that they do.

The institute is not interesting in the slightest. The NCR I’ll admit was pretty boring. The Legion is incredibly flawed but it’s still interesting. You think the institute is more interesting than the REPCONN ghouls? That side quest was more interesting than the entire Institute quest line. The Big Mountain scientist team was really dumb but it was still interesting and fun to play through. The institute just sucks. I think Fallout 4 as a whole is sort of sub par but the Institute was outright boring and seemed hastily thrown together.
        >The problem is the institute doesn’t have strategic nuance

They do.

>or moral ambiguity

No, not really. Which...isn't bad. The enclave don't either. Nor the legion.

>There’s very little rationale to anything that they do.

Sure. ...if you don't pay attention. See how it keeps circling back to a lack of audience participation?

>You think the institute is more interesting than the REPCONN ghouls?

Yes. Jason bright's group is...meh. Much like the rest of the game.

>The Big Mountain scientist team was really dumb but it was still interesting and fun to play through

That's subjective.

>but the Institute was outright boring and seemed hastily thrown together.

Yes. The institute. The big bad. The main antagonist. Hastily thrown together. Because that makes sense. ...well i guess it does if you refuse to pay attention.
Considering that htey can come back alter as feral ghouls, I am pretty sure they ain't all dead
    Those are the neighbors who didn't have a place in the Vault.
        Not all of them, Bust some of them yes
DNA isn’t all the same. That, and since did when vault tec care about life?
    The Institute isn't Vault-tec.
        Ya sure?
            Yes.  The Institute was created by the survivors of the Commonwealth Institute of Technology (aka, non-copyright MIT).  They may have had some projects that were used by the US government before the war, and by extension Vault-tec, but it wasn't affiliated with the company.
                History is written by the survivors.
The Institute is evil.  They didn't care about anyone else, so they approached it like they do everything else.  If they don't care, why still waste power on them, even if it's not their own?  They are evil bastards.
They didn’t. You’re a synth. They popped you in the cryo and set a timer to wake you up.
I think the most logical explanation would have to be Shauns DNA. They used his DNA to make all the Synths and the closest DNA to his, would be yours. So by leaving you alive they leave a good sample of similar DNA alive.
No, Kellogg only thawed you two out. The "life support failure" thing is confusing, because father himself thawed you back out.
What if the main character has all this knowledge to build, create/upgrade armor etc because everyone’s knowledge in 111 that died had their knowledge uploaded to the sole survivor.
Red Pill time: "The Institute killed all of Vault 111 you are a Synth?

Don't believe me? Check your inventory for Synth Component.
Maybe the institute discovered time travel and when going back in time to redo Shaun's capture, they chose to keep you alive because they knew you would be of great use to the institute (if you chose to help them)? They wouldn't want to travel back before the nukes because then they couldn't establish their world order. There would be no need to keep the dwellers alive because of synths. Plus, if I remember right, the life support failing wasn't intentional. I feel the only reason the mom died is because she put up a fight.
> **What was the point of killing everyone in Vault 111?**

They don't need the rest because Shaun is already a good candidate for the synth project, especially when he was just a little grub when the Institute kidnapped him. If they decide to kidnap someone adult like the Sole Survivor, they gonna have a hard time because you're not as malleable compared to a literal child and they're probably gonna struggle against them, evidenced by Kellogg killing your spouse.

Plus, your conjecture over their potential is pretty moot there are no projects established by the Institute which require them. Unless they want to create an army of atomic supermen or a gorilla-human hybrid, their DNA doesn't really have much use when they're focusing on GMO crops and de-extinct some gorillas at the time being.
    But would it even feel like kidnapping to the people of Vault 111?  Seriously, if the Institute had thawed your whole family out and taken you back to their safe, clean, and comfortable place to live, and told you that the world above was a blasted hellscape with no real hope of a future, you probably would have been fine with the cost of that being that they occasionally need a blood sample from you or your kid.  To the humans who live there the Institute is what the Vault promised to be.

And just because they're not currently doing any projects that would require a pre-war popsicle doesn't mean they *never* will.  It just seems really short sighted.
        >**And just because they're not currently doing any projects that would require a pre-war popsicle doesn't mean they never will. It just seems really short sighted.**

When I wrote my response to your conjecture, what I meant is the game doesn't establish any narrative or lore that requires them. 

To me, it's like asking why the NCR hasn't built any artillery when they could lore-wise, especially when the game depicts them as something potent. But then I realize that despite it all, it's just there for the sake of the plot, and it doesn't give enough care to expand it in the first place. 

Like, if the game establishes any significant lore that requires them aside from the Synth project, but Shaun killed the people regardless, then I might scratch my head too. However, unless I'm missing some relevant lore, the game doesn't really set anything like that.
I thought Shawn let them die.
    No, it was whoever was the director of the Institute when Shaun was kidnapped from the Vault.  Kellogg calls that person "the old man," but he also calls adult!Shaun "the old man" sixty years later, because the writers were trying to preserve the twist that Father was your now adult son.  It makes it awkward and confusing, though.
        It's been a minute I think I remember that
I wish they kept your spouse alive to have as a companion later (maybe through a quest or something) it'd make customizing both people at the start more interesting
2 things. The Institute and Shaun. The Institute could've remotely killed the others while Shaun could've did the same thing. Of course other commenters have pointed out other plausible happenings, but after so many play throughs, I honestly believe the Institute killed the others off since they wouldn't have been needed or resourceful to them.
When they shot your spouse and said at least we have a back up I figured the releasing of a parent years later to see how far they would go and what they would do to save their kid was an experiment they were doing. The other occupants just weren't needed so they didn't bother to refreeze them. It would also allow them to see how a pre-war person would react to and handle the new world. You just happened to be the only person there that they were able to give a good enough reason to survive (saving your kid).
I'm guessing that they really didn't want any variables that they couldn't control or deemed the others as too big a control group. Having a backup that shared the same DNA is likely their reasoning.
I believe it's at least partially explained that the reason shuan was chosen was because of the family connection. Having the mother and father was two branches of the original DNA sample that could be used in the initial project. One parent is obviously killed and the other released years later by Shaun himself. But other couples in the vault without children would be two entirely different DNA samples without a connecting factor which to me insinuates a whole restart of the project which is becoming unsustainable with their other issues and projects.
Could be that the vault only had the power to support 1 pod for any longer. As such cutting the rest would have saved you and your DNA if you were needed. Could be that they figured they didn't need others. Luckily they didn't use them for FEV testing or worse.

Think of it though. None of the other Sanctuary Hills residents had the drive, motivation, nor skills to survive. You'd take people so wholly out of their element and throw them into the wastes. Tantamount to throwing blind mice in with a snake. At least control vaults planned for potential dangers. 111 was never supposed to open. Probably more merciful they died in their sleep. That doesn't excuse the loss of life however.

Or else it could just be a plot device to call you a cool name. That's just as likely given the slapdash nature of Fallout 4 writing and story choice.
Plot convenience. Keep it simple.
My guess is that bethesda didn't know how to/want to start their game with plenty of pre-war people around you from the start and didn't have a good explanation for it
needless mass murder is essentially the Institute’s bread and butter. every major thing they’ve done is defined by its absurd toll in the lives of people who aren’t them.
I always assumed that even though pre-war humans had less corrupted DNA than post war humans, their DNA was already pretty corrupted by pre-war America and their lifestyle.

\- People smoked -  1950s level of smoking! And when you dissemble cigarettes in FO4, you get asbestos...

\- There's numerous text around the Fallout games warning you to take your home nuclear fusion back to servicing if you're experiencing nausea and your hair is falling out etc. Presumably walking around central Boston would get you exposed to all sorts of background rads too (from the amount of generators in the various buildings there).

\- Plus all of the spent nuclear fuel we know was being dumped into lakes and off the shore into the ocean in Boston

\- Plus the chems that were already circulating in society.

\*\*\*

Thus the rest of the adult residents would be of limited interest to the I.

Shaun being a baby would be less corrupted.

Llike others on this thread, I'm assuming that the SS is 'spare parts' in case Shaun gets unwell 

(though it falls apart a little bit here as Nate was likely exposed to rads in his service, but I guess in a post apocalyptic society, the Institute can't be too picky).
Because "Sole survivor" is a too good of a name to pass...
In the beginning of the game, when you are going down the elevator into the vault, a blast goes off and for a brief moment, everyone is washed over with the winds of the fall out. Later in the game they tell you t
    Sorry I got interrupted. Later in the game, they tell you that Sean was the only one that did not have damaged DNA. They also mentioned they tested other members of the vault. The damaged DNA of the other subjects could have come from either the fallout, or from the constant exposure of the nuclear power that powered everything from their cars to their dishwashers. Sean would not have been exposed for that long of a period of time. Therefore his DNA was pure. there were still other survivors in the vault, but their equipment had failed. The fact that your equipment did not fail, and you survived, was pure luck. They would not have any need for anyone after finding a good subject so the knowledge of other people still being in cryogenic freeze became obsolete.
I often thought about this whenever I replayed 4. I would love to see an alternate beginning if everyone who died in the cryo chambers all somehow lived and see how that would effect the story
Father says that you are chosen as backup since you have his dna
Maybe they don't want everyone getting ahold of pre war DNA
Then why is nates mom such a bitch. She needs some chems
It could even be an in-game explanation for why your settlements are (potentially, at least) so much better built than most of the established ones!  Some of your neighbors have the relevant skills.  Maybe the Callahans worked in construction, and Mr. Whitfield was a carpenter.
    One of them was a drug seller, Like a big time drug seller
        They would be a pillar in my community
            I mean like, Whole of Boston big
                Yes, yes, relevant skills, we understand
                    Guy was selling to a lot of people, Probably wasn't the bomb or the radiation that killed them after the apocalypse hit
                        THE COMMONWEALTH NEEDS CHEMS, WOLF!
                            As someone who is on anti-dep, Yeah it does
                        Correct me if I'm wrong but I seem to recall no dates on the neighboring house's computer journal entries. Maybe that drug dealer is a post war one.
                            The drug dealer was one of Nate's neighbors, His terminal is the one that is connected to a locked safe in Sanctuary
                                Right I just checked and even without dates, the dealer reference connections in the army, a potential cop under cover, definitly pre-war, my bad.
                                Oh wow, I've never found this.

            Thats actually funny I make jet to buy everything I own ;)
        I don't think he was one of the ones who made it into the vault, though?
            No.  If I remember correctly, the name on his mailbox is Hawthorne, which is the same name as one of the wealthy families in Diamond City.  The adventurer you meet when you first walk into the Dugout Inn is one of them.
        Nah, Nate is the biggest jet pusher in the commonwealth.
            Gotta put that fertilizer to use somehow. Easiest caps you'll ever make.
        Mistuh White, we gotta cook!
    Deffs better then the other group of neighbors, those guys try ro eat your skin.
    This goes especially well with all the promotional imagery of 111s door stating "societal preservation vault"
    I think all the neighbors die, they're outside the gates when you enter the vault and then near diamond city the named ghouls are the neighbors
    That coupled with sim settlements would of made the settlement system a lot more compelling
Which would also give you a reason to actually wanna do anything with Sanctuary
    Don’t most people do stuff with sanctuary cause of Preston and gang?
        Idk, but I doubt it. They're a pretty lackluster bunch imo, despite having an actual psychic and a hodunk genius. It's also way out of the way of literally everything.
        That's the very reason I go elsewhere actually.

    How's it relevant to their power issues, though? Vault 111 has completely seperate generators from the Institute.
        Read the terminal entries. The staff were having trouble keeping the vault going from the start. Issues with the pods as well
            This is the comment I was looking for, I remmember it being actual technical problems that were preventing the facility to keep working correctly.
                Yeah. Institute probably pushed it over the edge waking Nate and Nora up
        They're worried about the power grid holding up after 150+ years, especially if they need it running another 50+. 

Because their experience taught them it can be a problem.
Isn’t there a line about how the rest didn’t have the thing they wanted from Shaun?
I'm sure there's a mod for that 😂
So when Kellogg says "old man" he is actually referring to Todd Howard.
    "And the reward for that Vault run was horse-armor. HORSE-ARMOR!!! Who does that?!"
[deleted]
    how/where? not arguing, genuinely curious
        There's a note in Overseer's log about hiccups in the system thawing people early, and concern about how long the systems will work after they evacuate. Combine that with the Institutes fanatical power conservation efforts until Phase 3. 

The only statement is about "loose ends" but that's Kellogg talking and he'd be concerned about tying up loose ends much more than the scientists, and he's obviously not tying them all up as you survive. 

So when you consider the scientists made sure to shut down all the pods they didn't need, the power issues at the institute, and the known hiccup in the system with the overseer concerned about how long the pods will last (not power related, but an issue) and it's been 150 years most without maintenance (there's radroaches in the reactor by the time you wake up).

There's also Shaun's answer about why re-freeze you specifically, comments about how long the power has been an issue, and specifically that they killed the residents by turning off the power. 

Take it all together, it's the most likely explanation, they do definitely imply that's what happened.

Edit: I also feel like there's a few more conversations in the Institute that lead that way, but I can't remember the specifics. There's a few interesting tidbits in there that confirm things, like why Nora can fight the way she does if you talk to everyone.
        for me, it’s the most logical conclusion given the info provided hah i guess it’s a bit of contextual storytelling.
Then why not release the rest into the wasteland? Kick them out, lock the Vault door, and watch what they do. Y'know, for science.
Something to consider is that, The vault does have termianl entries that say that th epods do dispose of any body placed into them, Which si why there are some empty ones, As they where sued to dispose of bodies
    There's absolutely no terminal entry that says that.
        There actually is a line in the Overseer's instructions that reads "Unused cryogenic pods are the preferred method for cadaver disposal."
            I feel that's more so corpses don't rot, not that the pod itself is designed to kill you
        Once all residents have been sealed into their preservation chambers dispose of any detainees. Vault entryway must remain sealed under any circumstances. -Overseer Terminal
            Detainees are people that have been held for jumping the gate. 

That doesn't mean the people in the tubes.

        I had that once, Painfull
Maybe your settlement can be attacked at somepoint and everyone else is killed while you were looking for shaun and you were the sole survivor. So you establish the minute men to protect settlements to prevent it from happening again. It could even be tied to quency where you and Preston bond over both losing basically everyone in your old settlement.
Maybe:

you wake up, Kellog steals the kid, everyone realizes they're going to die and people start to fight back

Your character realizes:

(strength) they can fight their way out

(Perception) there's a hidden passageway to hide in  

(Endurance) they can take a couple of hits but push their way through it out of the vault

(charisma) they can talk their way out of a hostile confrontation and into a secret way out

(Intelligence) there's a cryo-gun in the overseer's office and they can make it work

(Agility) they should just run the fuck away really fast

(Luck) or they're just lucky

And at the end, it turns out that the institute burns the place down / nukes it / captures everyone leaving you the sole survivor. Y'know... like a role-playing game would do.
    Fallout was gold. These days we have leveled enemies and weapons in action-adventure open-world games and they call it RPG (ehm Assassin's Creed, witcher, Hogwarts Legacy, ...)

At least fallout let's me disarm a nuke or fuck over a town if I please.
It's crazy how slight tweaks to the institute could have made them interesting.  Even something as small as a not stupid evil motivation could easily make the faction interesting.

Dima from far harbor is what the institute should have been
    The Institute ends up basically doing every possible wrong thing and it's honestly quite annoying.
    It feels like the devs were working off a first draft from the writing team.
        I feel like they just went with generic b movie scifi villains.  They needed a good twist like actually replacing people to stop some other larger scope problems the other factions ignor or aren't capable of dealing with.
            To stop the spread of some new strain of pre-war plague or something. Something close to origins of FEV, that was originally developed no as a "super soldier serum", but a way to stop the disease.

I believe that plague was the central part of cancelled Van Buren, if I am not mistaken.
                Yeah that was the ultimate plot.  The pc was a carrier and would infect every settlement they encountered while the bad guys chasing you were trying to quarantine the plauge.

The ending had the pc having to pick the places the cure would go while nuking the rest iirc.

I also like the setup for 76 with the scorched plague.  It's backstory is more interesting than most games main quest and it's a shame bethesda didn't go with it as 76s main story instead of cleaning up the mess
                    Not exactly. Creating a cure for plague was a separate sub-plot. It was the automated and malfunctioning prison system that was trying to bring you and other prisoners back. You needed all of them back yourself to deactivate it.

Bad guy was a mad ex-NCR scientist monitoring you actions and willing to bombard the living crap outta USA.

Final decision - pick an area to sacrifice using BOMB space station (same as one if FO76's crater) as you were too late to stop the launch.

In essence, that scientist became a prototype for Father Elijah from Dead Money.

With some adjustments, Van Buren could work as a perfect New Vegas prequel, given a lot of characters!/events/locations/factions are still mentioned inNew Vegas.

As for FO76, I still wish it was a proper SP spin-off. It had a huge potential and in most aspects I still like it more than FO4.
                        They used some of the Van Buren plot for Fallout 76, and some in the New Vegas Lonesome Road DLC.

The mad scientist was deliberately trying to spread the plague, since this was the only way to raise the automated 'alert' level so he could unlock the BOMB satellites.    His motivation was essentially the same as Ulysses in Lonesome Road - he wanted to wipe away the existing societies to start again from scratch.
            > I feel like they just went with generic b movie scifi villains.

That's because they are, it's the only way to actually advance technology.  See my [theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/11ohbon/comment/jbtbu3m/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) above...
    The institute has reasons for what they do. Don't listen to people who don't pay attention.
        What are those reasons?
            The institute sends super mutants to the surface to keep it destabilized. A unified surface brings in a threat to the institute (just look at the minutemen or brotherhood or railroad who are all unified factions that can take on the institute). It also allows the region to remain relatively stagnant, allowing the institute free reign of resources.

They also replace people for political reasons. Like mcdonough. Or to oversee projects. Like roger Warwick.
                Lmao, the only reason they're a threat to the institute is because the institute is killing and replacing random fuckin people. It's not exactly a chicken/egg situation.
                    Yes. They're imperialists. Empires/imperialists tend to create enemies.
                        No they're not, they're isolationists. They want nothing to do with the surface, by their account. So why do they keep doing things to make the surface hate them?
                            Because they are the Think Tank played (somewhat) straight.  A lot of the things they do have no other purpose than to be weird, directionless science experiments.
                            There are different forms of imperialism. Remember when the u.s. said they were entering an isolationist phase and still conquered islands and such?

>So why do they keep doing things to make the surface hate them?

Because they *want* to be hated. /s

They require resources. Just like every society. So they do what they can to keep those resources out of everyone's hands but theirs.
                                They're really not imperialists, Shaun literally says they want to wait for the surfacers to die out. And iirc the only outside resource they ever needed was the mass fusion generator, before that they were self sufficient. Occasionally they recruited scientists from the surface. But we never see them gathering resources.

Imo the biggest problem with the Institute's motivation is why they made the synths. They say they're working on humanity's evolution, which would imply they want synths to replace humans. But if that's true, why do they deny synth sentience and use them as slaves?
                        I think people just weren't in the mood for an Ivy League Enclave.
                            they're not like the enclave.
                                No? A technologically superior pre-war holdout group that is comically evil when it doesn't benefit them at all and thinks of all human life outside their small community as expendable, and wants to perpetuate the worst of the pre-war culture that caused the war in the first place. And their primary interest in the player character is due to their genetic purity. That doesn't remind you the tiniest bit of the Enclave?
                > just look at the minutemen or brotherhood or railroad who are all unified factions that can take on the institute

Because the institute are objectively evil because of their constant actions, you're saying the reason they do their evil actions is because of the consequences of their evil actions
                    ...no, they do their actions because they're evil. but they do have reasons that aren't "oh we're evil". sending super mutants to the surface isn't "we're evil" it's "we don't want anyone to be able to unite against us".
                        Are you trying to say that intentionally creating murderous mutants to send to terrorize people isn't evil?
                            It is. But their *reasoning* is *not* "we are doing it because we are evil". They do not think they are evil. They *justify* it or have different reasons for it.
                                Dude nobody is saying the Institute doesn't self rationalize their stupid evil tendencies. People are saying they would prefer is there was actual nuance instead of stupid evil. Personally I would have preferred an Institute that has screwed up BECAUSE they are trying to help the surface without interacting with it. Would have been interesting where you spend almost the whole game expecting some Cabal of evil mad scientists just to arrive and find out they are just way out of the depth.
                                If as you say their justification is to prevent people uniting against them, then it makes zero sense, because the whole reason why factions like the minutement are uniting against them is BECAUSE what they're doing is evil.
                I cant believe you are being downvoted for talking actual lore.

Im with you my man
                    Because this fanbase hates the lore and likes to make up their own.
                        Lmao man, I'll be honest, everyone knows the Institute justifies it themselves. The justification is all ass cause none of it makes sense. You seem to fail to realize that just because the writing gives a reason doesn't automatically make it good. 

This is why people say the writing is poor, cause sure, the Institute says they have reasons, but when you scrutinize them, you realize the reasons make no fucking sense. **You've also failed to acknowledge that the Institute's goal is to help the Commonwealth and use science to better the post war world**. 

That's something they establish to you once you become leader of the institute. So let's breakdown some of their actions and see how well does it serve the goal mentioned above. 

They made supermutants to destabilize the area so that no one would oppose them. Okay, but why exactly? The Institute themselves have stated they were focused on their research and advancing it, but they clearly don't have plans for world domination. Why do they *need* to destabilize an entire region? How does that serve their goals in research? They state they want to make a better world, one more similar to the pre-war Era, but then they create an entire faction of super mutants who then actively ruin the Commonwealth? 

Even then, how does fucking over other factions hurt them? The altruistic minute men could have been used to meet the goal of making the Commonwealth better. The Railroad wouldn't have needed to exist had they adopted a less blatantly brain dead outlook on synths. "Let's create synths who can act, feel, and be human but oh, they just aren't human to us!" The only faction that would seriously oppose them is the BoS yet the super mutants weren't a problem for them. The BoS are outsiders, they didn't have a real establishment in the Commonwealth til the event of Fallout 4. So the release of super mutants just fucked over the only factions that could have worked with them, and also just fucked over the Commonwealth incredibly. Not to mention that it makes their synths ' job of finding and salvaging significantly harder now. Like, creating super mutants was by far the dumbest thing they did cause it's like dumping a bucket of soap to clean a spill. Sure itl clean the spill, but now there's a bucket of soap you need to clean up. 

Kidnapping people is also fucking bizarre because again, it makes no sense. What's the end goal? Sure, you can argue they kidnap political figures but it's not even that. We see that they straight up kidnap random ass people too and replace them. Tell me, what purpose **that serves the Institute 'a goals** does kidnapping a random farmer do? They argue that they actually are taking valued individuals which makes even less sense. Why would you risk exposing your secret organization by taking in a bunch of randoms and then replace them? You literally had an entire vault of frozen folk, some of which were alive, and killed them. Even then, they had the ability to create sentient beings with potentially mechanical skillets. **Why would you not use the fucking intelligent robot beings to cover any logistical internal staffing?**

Again, the Institute would have been fine had they been openly more evil with their ambitions. But no, you meet them and they mostly just want to continue their research. What they *do* and what they *want* fail to align, hence why people say that the Institute is a shallow, immoral organization.
                            >You've also failed to acknowledge that the Institute's goal is to help the Commonwealth and use science to better the post war world

...no. It's not. Their entire questline involves them getting the necessary requirements to have their own power independence and thrive *underground* while they leave the surface in squalor because they see it as an irredeemable hell.

I...am not sure i want to waste my breath on the rest of your comment after this. Honestly.
                                If they plan on thriving underground, why did they destabilize the surface?
                                >...no. It's not. Their entire questline involves them getting the necessary requirements to have their own power independence and thrive underground while they leave the surface in squalor because they see it as an irredeemable hell.

Except that's not their only goal. They straight up tell you they want to "help the Commonwealth" or that the "Commonwealth will have nothing to fear," at times. This is why I said they are poorly written. Their goals are that they want to help the Commonwealth but also they want to stay isolated away from it cause they view it to be unredeemable. They think the people are savages yet they take them or experiment on them. They believe that their brand new synths can be used to replace human beings yet somehow view them as if they were still bumbling, obvious robots that can't at all be anything resembling human.

Father himself states that the Institute is trying to redefine mankind. What does that even mean if they also view their human like creations as not human whatsoever. Not to mention that Father will actually have the Institute form Public relations if you can convince him.

This is also a tendency shown by the game that the Institute fails to consolidate a single goal because they don't genuinely have a solid goal to reach. 

Even then, their goal of staying underground and being independent is still not at all aligned with their actions. Why do they want to stay away from everybody if they actively antagonize people? Why release super mutants into the area that makes things worse for everyone involved and is a super huge risk? Why not just do what needs to be done cause we actively don't see *any* benefit for the Institute in replacing people at all. Sure, they can act as spies, but **why do they need spies in the first place? They have synths who can replace humans, so why don't they just integrate them into societies rather than kidnapping people like a comic villain**? They can make their own super synths that are super human that would obviously, and so clearly be able to become incredibly well-respected in places like Diamond City yet they choose to just steal people, turn them into super mutants, and make a whole ass new synth to replace them? 

Even then, their replacements are genuinely ass considering how often people notice it.

If they want to just be left alone, why do they actively not try to do that? Had they just done everything silently, nobody would have known about anything. They have all the resources to create their own army, gorillas, and humans yet they somehow didn't opt to just, not do things the easy way? It's supposed to show that the Institute is full of a bunch of narcissists and cynics, but at the same time it just makes the Institute incredibly incompetent. If their main goal was independence, why are they actively making themselves known to the world and also choosing to piss them off rather than work with them? There's a difference between thinking the world above is unsalvageable and another to commit mass murder.

None of it makes sense because the two things we hear about what the Institute wants doesn't match their actions. They want to stay secluded and do their own thing? Then why do the actively antagonize people outside causing ire against them and thus leading to their downfall? Why do they kidnap people and experiment on them to make super mutants? Why make super mutants and actually make the job of salvaging worse by letting them take over multiple areas of the game? This is made worse considering they literally have the most secure entrance before the Sole Survivor comes in. They are virtually untouchable yet they keep acting as if they aren't and proceed to make the most absurd evil decisions that guarantee that the Commonwealth wants them dead. 

They also tell you they want to help the Commonwealth and obviously what they do doesn't at all align with that nonsense. 

So both goals that have been interpreted by the community (because again, the Institute is a walking narrative mess on heels that is forced to be comically evil yet somehow incredibly incompetent) fail to at all align with their goals. 

Also yeah, somehow hitting enter just sent the comment for whatever reason lmao.
                        How would anyone unite against the institute if no one knows they exist and the only way in is a teleporter? In what way are they threatened? And before that they were at risk of what? The minute men becoming a major player, the only unambiguously good faction? Wouldn't their whole plan would have made more sense to help the minute men and then leverege the favors for power?
                            >How would anyone unite against the institute if no one knows they exist and the only way in is a teleporter? In what way are they threatened?

...the railroad and brotherhood and minutemen all fought against the institute without knowledge of their base or teleportation. The minutemen even was a force to reckon with against the institute at one point.

However, the unification doesn't have to be directly threatening. It could make it harder for the institute to replace key people. Or get parts for their projects. Etc.

>Wouldn't their whole plan would have made more sense to help the minute men and then leverege the favors for power?

Why would they help the minutemen? Who went against them in the past?
                                We are back to the circular logic problem of the institute. Everyone hates them because they were assholes and then that justifies them being assholes. If they didn't suck and stayed to true to either goal, helping the wasteland like you get told when you take over. Or two just stayed underground and worked to establish their own power grid. Neither of those goals require the super mutants, neither requires kidnapping. And as someone else said, why even make synths this smart? Just stop like one generation ago and they would have largely avoided the whole robot slavery problem but still had a free labor pool. Most of the time it seems the best explanation for why, is that it seems the writers needed it that way, and that's bad writing
                        Indeed, i stopped correcting people here becuase they literally refuse actual lore with source, and rather upvote shitty theories like the player being a synth or pretend that NV is a flawless game.

>"Why would you even do that?"

Hm... About to meet Shaun in my latest playthrough, going to try imagining he inherented the place from Cave Johnson and see how that feels.
    Science isn't about why. It's about WHY NOT!
The super mutants and replacements do have a certain amount of logic to them, though.  They were studying the FEV, and had gotten to the point where Virgil was able to create a cure for at least the one specific strain of the disease that he was infected with.

As for the replacing people with synths, that seems to have two reasons: 
1) Replacing influential people gives them control over the settlements that are large and well-established enough to maybe become a threat in the future. 
2) Simple expedience. Want a site on the surface to test your new strain of bioengineered pumpkins?  Replace the farmer with a synth, that's obviously the easiest way. They never thought they could make a synth that doesn't look like anyone, send him up to the farm with the seeds, and tell him to say he's a farmer looking for work, because they really don't see the people on the surface as human beings.
The supermutants could be explained as the Institute not carrying about what happens to the surface, which they make evidently clear by isolating themselves. Instead of wasting resources trying to kill the mutants, they can just teleport them to the surface and let them roam. This has the side effect of keeping the Commonwealth weak, as the Institute rightly fears that the surface could breach into the sanctuary that is the Institute. By keeping the Commonwealth disorganized and controlling how the population thinks and acts, the Institute can guarantee themselves that no threat will come to them so long as it’s kept that way.

Replacing people plays a key role in observing the Commonwealth and making sure that nothing is being planned. By hiding amongst the populace as another face, they can influence people by using that synth to spread what the Institute wants. They’ve already have Diamond City under control, and thus have reduced threats to them significantly.

Although it’s their fault that the surface fears them, they are a bunch of self-righteous scientists that believe what they’re doing is for the good of everyone. They believe the surface is lost and only good to test experiments out in the field and for resources, and probably believe that after the Broken Mask incident that the Commonwealth would never accept them, leading to the CPG massacre. They themselves cannot be wrong, it’s the outside who is wrong and hindering humanities progress. That is the attitude the Institute has and why they continue to do the things they do.
Because "SCIENCE!" isn't scientific, it's wacky mad scientist shit.  If you stick with logic, you aren't doing "SCIENCE!" and don't get the crazy techno super effects.  This is why every group that advances technology invariably creates some horrible side effects.  The Brotherhood understands this on some level, and fights against it.

Seriously, that's my theory re a lot of Fallout.  Their "technological advancements" are actually magical techniques based on the PERCEPTION of technology, pop culture, etc.
I think the reasoning for replacing people was to gain Intel on the commonwealth? Like spies? Which also seems redundant since they apparently have bird security cameras all over the place.

So yeah, they do unnecessary evil stuff for no reason other than "You wouldn't be able to understand."
F4 didn't have the best writing.  Especially the institute.
To be fair, “Why would you even do that?” Could also be the motto of Vault Tech, Mr. House, the Enclave, Big MT, and even a bunch of historical R&D wings of government agencies in real life.
    Technically, if we consider cancelled Fallout games such as Van Buren, didn't VaultTec have ties with the Enclave? Wasn't collecting data on humans' survivability in extreme environments the purpose of their experiments to use later for colonising a new planet?

Big MT went awry due to robo-brain tech for life extension being rather unstable. Scientists literally went mad.

What's wrong with Mr. House? Besides his inability to accept status of NCR citizen and actually try working things out with BoS, his logic is pretty sound.
That could be said of most IRL experiments, and both the FEV, Synths and killings that the Institute does is explained by the leader and the companion that you get w/institute, they want to cleanse the surface to be the “better” humans, the problem is, if there is no lower humans to experiment on, what’s the point?
And thank god Emil Pagliarulo left so no more games can be tainted with his god-awful writing.
    >Emil Pagliarulo

Um, he's still there or were you being facetious? He is the lead designer on Starfield. Unfortunatley.
        At Feb 3rd I heard news that he was leaving, but now I can't find it anymore
I think a lot of people could stand to look into the sort of senseless, barbaric atrocities that have been committed under the pretense of "science" in the real world.

If anything about the Institute's clinical indifference to the lives of wastelanders and their willingness to kill them for no practical reason is unrealistic, it's that they didn't go *far enough*.
That is literally the Institute's whole thing. Science for no reason beyond science
Just because you don't like the way they're written doesn't mean it's bad. The institute is consistent with their depiction of being incompetent at everything that doesn't fall into any scientific field. Kellogg even questions the decision of killing the rest of the people. People making stupid mistakes isn't bad writing, it makes them feel more real.   
The institute acts exactly how an underground science dictatorship that's been isolated for 200 years would act.
...the game literally has reasons for why the institute does what they do. You literally just have to pay attention. The most basic of audience participation.

You have no platform to criticize if you must lie or misconstrue or just be ignorant because you refuse to participate as an audience member.

The fact my comment that is calling out people who don't pay attention is heavily downvoted is sad.
    ....wow dude.  I'm not the OP or who you're commenting on.  But I think I speak for everyone when I say.  We appreciate your passion.  That's super cool that you liked it so much and understood it so well!  Sounds like you had a great experience with Fallout 4.  So did I!    


But he's allowed to have his opinion about the story.   That's kinda how it works.  We can all experience different things in our own ways and have our opinions on it.  And that's ok.  


It doesn't take away from your experience, your enjoyment of the story...or your opinion of the story.
        >But he's allowed to have his opinion about the story

Sure. But an ignorant opinion (because they refuse to pay attention) is not a valid one.

You might as well say i'm allowed my ignorant opinion on, say, shawshank redemption. Didn't pay attention to it, but i *could* say it is the worst movie to ever exist and is poorly written. How is it poorly written? Idk, i didn't pay attention. That's not how this works, though. If you refuse to pay attention, but then act like the writing **is** flawed...your claim is invalid.
            Or....he just views it differently then you.  and he didn't like explanations that maybe you did.  Or things that felt like they fit like a glove to you....felt forced to him.  that's kind of how differences of opinions work.  Hell...it's given you something to talk about this morning/eevening, so aren't differences of opinions beneficial?
                Mr. Benjamin_Starscape is being really aggressively argumentative all over the post.  Not just disagreeing with people, but calling everyone with a differing opinion "ignorant" like it's on his word of the day calendar.  And when someone offers a rebuttal to his points, he ignores the point they made to call them stupid a second time.
                    I'm not a guy. And i'm not calling anyone ignorant. I'm calling their "opinions" ignorant because it shows they didn't pay attention.
                        Sorry for assuming, I made an educated guess since you have a masculine screenname.  But male, female, both, or neither, you're still being *really obnoxious* on this post.
                            all i'm asking for is that people pay attention to the media they consume. if that's obnoxious, sue me.
                                You're assuming that *your* interpretations are the only correct ones, and *everyone* who came to a different conclusion than you simply didn't "pay attention."  And complaining that the fandom has gotten dumb because some people are disagreeing with you.

Do you not see how that's obnoxious?
                Ignorant opinions aren't beneficial. They only spread ignorance and make the audience dumber. This fanbase has gotten dumber. Audiences overall have gotten dumber. Gamers as a whole do not pay attention.

You shouldn't let ignorance go under "it's just an opinion". It breeds ignorance.
                    You seem like the kind of guy that thinks you need an especially high IQ, such as yours, to understand the nuances of Rick and Morty.
                        I'm not a guy, iq is not a good measure of intellect, and i don't find rick and morty nuanced or funny or good.

You made an awful lot of assumptions that were all wrong. If saying you should pay attention, the most basic ask for the audience, feels like you need a high iq...idk what to really tell you.

Because literally all i'm telling people is to *pay attention*.
                            It was a joke that clearly sailed a few thousand feet above your head but alright.
                                Or it just wasn't a good joke.
            You are allowed your ignorant opinion on Shawshank. You are allowed to have any opinion on anything you want. That’s the neat thing about opinions.
                >You are allowed your ignorant opinion on Shawshank

No! No, i am not. In that example i refused to pay attention and then criticized it. That is *not* okay. Criticism through ignorance is not criticism.
            grow the fuck up.
                Yes. *i'm* the one who needs to grow up.
                    yes, you are. you're acting like a petulant child.
                        I mean they are almost certainly 11
                        ...because i don't like comments that spread misinformation due to the commenter not paying attention?
                            Bro is calling opinions misinformation lmao it's not that deep dude it's a video game
                                video games are a form of art. the same as books, movies, and paintings. saying that the game has bad writing based on nothing other than you not paying attention *is* misinformation.

it's also, again, not an opinion. it's just ignorance. plain ignorance. which would easily be fixed by the most basic of audience participation...paying attention. it's not some huge ask.
The idea that the writing is the worst part of a Fallout game would make people in 1998 laugh at you
yeah that why in my head the insitute ist the most evil of all "bad guys" in the fallout series.

 The Master had a good reason to do what he did. that it was flawed yes but he had a plan.

Same with the Fallout 2 Enklave.the probly the second on the Most Evil People List in Fallout.

The Fallout 3 Enklave is well divide the Part Loyal to Henry Eden is bad as bad as the Fallout 2 Enklave. the Paert Loyal to Autumm is less Evil becuas he Hates Edens Plan to kill all People.

Falllout New Vegas Bad the Legion is well a Good Place 3 on the Bad Guy list. the have a Plan but really only for the Short term.when Ceaser Dies the Legion Dies.
Always thought super mutants were a side effect from scientists trying to make radiation immune humans. 

As for replacing people with synths weren't they recording/spying on people gathering information.
Replaying FO4 after a long break reminded me of just how irritating it is that the super mutants are in the Commonwealth, especially with *how* *many of them* there are. I know the Institute was trying to sabotage the surface world as much as possible, presumably so they could shake their heads sadly and go "see? synths are the only solution :(", but creating super mutants just doesn't make any bloody sense. 

And then! They're also on Far Harbor!! Somehow!!!!! Bethesda please you don't have to shoehorn them in everywhere just because they were in DC and the Mojave, especially when they have absolutely zero interesting quests except for Strong. I really hope they're not in the next game :/
Well you know how long they have been trying to make BOS the best they can be. In canon. First games made them mystical, later they realized lots of future plot likes could be the end of the BOS. So it makes sense why we get a story of a spinter of the BOS becoming badasses and claiming the mantel. The institution being insane is likely a justification to help them look better.
In the game it states that despite being isolated, radiation still managed to seep through and effect their genes…_somehow_. So the only non-mutated genes were the frozen pre-war vault-dwellers.
    Which is especially funny when you consider that as Sole & family entered the vault a nuke went off so close to them that they were hit with the initial wave as the elevator descended, *and* that everything on the surfacer world pre-war most likely had radioactive contamination because none of the companies operating there were interested in making things correctly.

Hell my Sole is addicted to Nuka Quantum, which is basically what if radiation was a cool blue drink lol.
[deleted]
    Ahh my bad, I remembered that they were in isolation since before the bombs dropped.
I'd think the Institute folks would have CLEANER DNA than Shaun by the time Kellogg lugs him back across the wasteland to the Institute, unless they teleport directly into the main area of the vault and then back from the Institute directly. Also the Institute Lady they send with Kellog is wearing some sort of anti contamination suit when we see her.

I have an alternative game start in my head I will forever wish happened:

The Institute finds Vault 111. Look at all of that pure prewar DNA!! They're all alive, cryogenically sealed. 

Let's send a batch of our friendliest looking scientists to get into the vault. "Some of you will be risking exposure to radiation but it will be worthwhile. We're going to "rescue" all of these people from their frozen prisons!" Says the Institute Leader.

The techs enter the vault and reach the two rooms containing dwellers. 

They release the cryo pods one at a time as one person calls out the state of life support on each dweller from the main computer. If the person is marked as deceased, they are left in their pod. Anyone with deceased family members is consoled and brought out to leave for the Institute.

We see Nate/Nora and Shaun let out of their pod, and your spouse is briefed while they move down the pods. But your pod, yours is marked as deceased. Apparently the oxygen pump in your pod failed, and you can't have survived without it. Your spouse is devastated and allowed to mourn for a moment, but then whisked off to the Institute.

Time passes, days, months, years we're not sure. Suddenly your pod door malfunctions similar to the original cutscene. You wake up, confused and coughing and drop out of your pod. As you look up, the other pods are mostly open. One or two in your room are also still shut. Then as you stand shakily, the others also open. About half of the people left behind are alive like you, the rest are deceased from varying natural causes. Those who are left don't up understand what happened. How are we alive? Where is everyone else? The rest of our families?

You take the lead. Everyone calm down and stay together. We need to search the vault. You lead the NPCs through the vault, maybe they each have comments or abilities to even help reach the exit faster. Maybe one of the women has Bobby Pins in her hair she's willing to hand over and it changes her hair style. You search the rooms, read terminals, try for the cryolator but no one has the skill to pick it. 

You fight through the army of radroaches, learning through the standard terminals of details on your experiment but nothing noting your families' exit. You make it to the exit and take up the pip boy, now being given the title of Overseer by your residents. 

You bid the people to exit. There isn't any food down here there's barely any water, and staying risks waiting for more rad roaches to invade and potentially overwhelm. 

This brings a small argument up amongst the residents but one of them finally shouts "If our families are out there, then they're up above damnit! They aren't in here! If we want to see them again, we risk the elevator."

Everyone comes back to their senses and gathers in a circle on the platform, just like when you went down. You step in the center, and gain your last minute prompt to edit your appearance or abilities. 

You make your choice, then the scene fades up to the surface. You've made it, and now it's time for you and your neighbors to go home.
    That would be a great premise for an AU fanfic.
        Haha yes now if only I can learn to draw people properly I'd make it into a comic
    I really like this a lot. 

But if the intro/tutorial was a second longer I'd lose my mind.
        I don't think it needs to be much longer for my idea to work. Then again most of the time I end up running into those other rooms anyway so I wouldn't have trouble spending another couple seconds picking up some friends. I guess that last cutscene with them arguing could lengthen it a little but hopefully not too much.
            Have one settler ask "do you know what happened here?!"

Then pick a dialogue option:

1: Yes, follow me! We'll find our families, I promise. [Skips tutorial, you exit straight to the elevator ride]

2: I... no. We'd better look around and figure out what's going on. [You play the tutorial/ explore the vault]

I'd play this as an alternative intro mod!
                Yess
Or if Shaun is so significant for his clean DNA, why not take father and mother at the same time with you, teleport them in, and then convince them to have more babies? Or just have 2 more clean sets of DNA to work off of while you rescue them?
    Adults can fight back and resist, an infant can be molded and controlled easily.
        Why would they though? In an apocalypse, the Institute offers shelter, food, and modern conveniences. And they wouldn’t know anything about them being sketchy.
Shawn himself says that not even the institute scientists could escape all of the radiation
Probably the director of the Institute at that point, whoever it is.  Calling adult!Shaun "The Old Man" later was the writers trying to preserve the twist, but it doesn't make sense for Kellogg to be calling someone he's known since he was a baby and is at least 40 years younger than him "old man."
    [deleted]
        [Old man](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/old%20man) is also a common term for "a man in authority."
See also: bottlecaps
    I think Cap Collector is just magical, honestly.
Pre war gov tried to limit population having weapons.  Older games explained you needed licenses for even owning combat armor etc so likely its those who couldn't or didn't want to go through the (likely pretty rigged) licensing system.
    But no Pipe pistols in DC or the Mojave. It's a shit retcon to explain their mistake.
        Maybe Boston just had someone actually bothering with making pipe guns which then spread all over the place.
The bastard keeps raking his leaves onto *my* lawn!
    The shear audacity of it. Poor Cogsworth almost blew a fuse last time he did it.
They killed all the other dwellers because they already had Shaun’s DNA, they kept you on ice just in case something happened to him and shut the other pods down so that all the power can be redirected to your pod. Your character is referred to as the “Backup” when you talk to father on top of the CIT
    An entire vault's worth of prewar survivors, each of them potentially useful in future, not to mention that they are already useful as is, not least of which because you already knew they weren't going anywhere, who already had strenuous Vault Tec med screenings.

The breadth and depth of ways that would be useful to a group of science nerds is too much to count.

Killing the entire vault's population, even sabotaging the ongoing cryogenics test, was not only evil, but stupid evil. It's not even 'tying up loose ends' because there were at least three additional rooms of viable dwellers worth of very useful potential candidates, to say nothing of the premium foolishness of killing them all _but_ you for sake of a backup.

You had an entire vault full of backups, and now you only have one. Way to go, Institute Director Dumbass.
        The Institute has been shown to be uncaring and xenophobic towards to surface population. Which leads to things such as massacring whole towns/vaults, which is shown throughout our own history, “war never changes”. I wouldn’t even call it stupid/cartoonishly evil because that has happened in our own history, people who think of people as lesser will just kill them because they think they’re superior. Another one of the institutes flaws is that their arrogance blinds them and makes them do stupid things, which could also explain the vault dwellers being killed. 

And the Backup needed to have the same DNA as Shaun, IIRC that was mentioned at the end of the Battle of Bunker Hill quest
            I agree with this POV in principle - the final talk with Shaun on the building where he goes "yep civilisations is destroyed look at this" and your Sole doesn't get to bring up ANY of the world they're doing to rebuild is stupid but shows how single-minded the Institute is with regards to their own superiority...

...But it doesn't explain their ultimate goal. Like at all. Do they want to retake the surface? Remain underground forever? Well then why do they keep sabotaging the surface? Why did they make super mutants? Why are they replacing surface people with synths? What's the *point* of it all? Even if you become Director there's no real explanation of their exact end goal and it's so frustrating. At least Minutemen = rebuild Commonweath, Railroad = rescue all synths, BOS = exterminate technological threats. Institute = ??????????? uhhh cool robots. Or something.
                Yep. 'What does the Institute *want*' is the driving question of the game, and  unlike the clear and defined goals of everyone else, the Institute is this vague and hazy nebulous blob of science nerds who have spent the last two centuries peeing in everyone else's cornflakes for no clear goal or reason.

I suspect, that in much the same way the Gunners are a reskin of Talon Company, the Institute was originally going to be a reskin of the FO3 Enclave- unambiguously bad guy nazi-likes that you can mow down without guilt or remorse.

Then New Vegas came out, and people loved and still love to this day, the fact that you can support anyone and have fairly cogent arguments for all the factions, much like Daggerfall. ^(Ceaser's Legion is a bunch of losers and a dead end ideology though.)

So I imagine that Emil decided to retool the factions drastically *after* they had already started development, and that's why the Institute is so.... nebulous.
That's the meta reason.  I'm wondering what the in-universe reason for it would be.
    Thats like asking what psychopath thought it would be a good idea to put keyed locks on a first aid kit
It could have made a fantastic scripted event if, just like the F:NV DLC Honest Hearts, the other survivors were immediately killed upon exiting the Vault or on Sanctuary. Having them promptly ripped to shreds by feral ghouls after walking into their ruined homes would have set some real stakes. Also it would tell you Codsworth is an excellent companion for combat.
But the person Kellogg was referencing wasn't "Father."  Father is Shaun, it's a nickname he got because his DNA was used to make all the gen 3 synths.  At the time the other residents were thawed out and left to asphyxiate in their pods, "Father" was a six month old baby.

I think the confusion is because Kellogg refers to the director of the institute as "the old man," but he also calls adult!Shaun "the old man" sixty years later, even though it makes no sense, because the writers were trying to preserve the twist that Father was your now adult son.
    How does it make no sense? It's okay to not like the story but, seriously. They're both old men who had pretty much the same relationship with Kellogg as Kellogg physically stayed the same age. Does it actually make NO sense that he would refer to them both as the old man?
        Okay, maybe it doesn't actually make *zero* sense, but I still think it was awkwardly written to preserve the twist.  I feel like if Kellogg had called them both "the Director" it would have worked better.
            I agree that would probably have worked a bit better. I think it's only really awkward because he refers to them as "the" old man but, I don't think it's really that weird I mean being nicknamed "old man" or "the kid" is not super uncommon
Or the opposite.  Its that neighbor that always hated you. He heater you, your partner, your nicer house, your nicer car, your Mr. Handy and things really popped off for him when Shaun came along and suddenly your family was the talk of sanctuary hills.  They could be the kind of antagonist that doesn't want you dead.  They want you to live in the wasteland without your partner, without your son, and without a hope of ever having your classic "American Dream" life back.
And that guy... is the Mysterious Stranger!
I've heard that "the player character is a synth" theory before, but frankly I can't buy it.  There are a number of reasons, but one of the biggest is because Father wants to make you director of the Institute. The Institute is so *thoroughly* dismissive of the idea that Synths have any personhood, there's absolutely no way they would accept making a Synth the director.   

Also, if you were a synth, why wouldn't Father use your recall code and go "well, that didn't work" when you turn against them?
    See, and I find it to be the theory that makes the most sense. 

I mean, why else would Father finally release his parent, after so many years, only to leave them to wander completely unprepared and alone in a very, very dangerous environment, with almost no supplies or weapons to start out with. It would be an almost guaranteed horrible death for anybody else. Why go through that whole charade of the child synth in Diamond City with Kellogg to use as bait. Kellogg was an extremely dangerous mercenary. And true, Nate was a soldier, but Nora was a lawyer. Either way, it was an extremely risky and dangerous thing to make your parent do for no reason other then to see if your parent would get revenge. I know that Shawn wanted to get revenge on Kellogg, but I'm sure there were many, many possible ways to do so without using such a convoluted made up rescue fantasy. Unless the parent was unwittingly a synth with courser-like strength and abilities. 

My headcanon is that when they resealed the vault, they did it improperly, and everybody died. Father had some serious Daddy/Mommy issues, and daydreamed his whole life about his non-shot parent somehow surviving, and wondered just how far they'd go to rescue him, because they loved him. Then, when he realized he was dying, he needed a worthy successor. Why not kill two birds with one stone? He could create a customized synth that would basically be their parent, one that would adapt and grow more powerful. He would get to live out his fantasy of his parent's loving crusade to find him, plus a few extra loose ends tied up and a healthy dose of poetic revenge in the process. And, to top it all off, when the parent does arrive in the Institute, they meet a child replica of Shawn, while the real one observed in the other room. It was obvious that Father really, really wanted to see his fantasy of his parent swooping in and saving the child him, even if it was just observing it. Obviously, that didn't quite work out. 

As for his views on synths, it wouldn't really matter, as this synth was obviously different then the others. It was HIS. It was perfect. And it was his masterpiece and his dream made real. It could be a secret project that the majority of the institute was unaware of, or it could be that this synth was hyped up to be humanity perfected, unlike the other inferior models. But Shawn would have his answer. How it felt to be loved. And if his beloved parent would approve of his life's work, or if he would have disappointed them utterly.
There's too much that goes against the idea of the Sole Survivor being a synth. Like where did your memories come from then? How did the Railroad and Brotherhood not notice it?

>There is also a terminal in either robotics or live sciences in The Institute which talks about a feature for future synths which they were currently prototyping. It describes an effect similar to V.A.T.S., an ability to slow down time to make combat calculations. You are able to target the radroaches in Vault 111 before you get your pip boy.

That terminal isn't in the actual game. It was deleted.
    Not sure what version you're playing. It's in my version on XBox. Every single time. They put it back in.
        Well, you're the only one. It was not in any of my playthroughs and the wiki still lists it as inaccessible. You sure you're not using mods?
            I use mods, definitely, but the terminal entry in question was actually in the original game. Some derp programmer at Bethesda forgot to "turn it on" (according to YouTuber JuiceHead). This was rectified with the release of Far Harbor in 2016. If you play the game without Far Harbor, that entry will not be there.

The wiki may list it as cut content, but it was restored with Far Harbor. Kinda makes DiMA's suggestion that you could be a synth a pretty obvious hint.
                I have played the game with Far Harbor. And this youtuber can read minds apparently and know what unknown developers were thinking?
                    Okay, cool then. Prove me wrong. Next time you play, check out all the terminals in Robotics at The Institute.
                        I have checked all the terminals in the Institute.
                            Also checked - not there.
It’s interesting that even Dima hints at it that you could possibly be a synth when you first talk to him in far harbor. Also think about when you first meet Shaun/father they put you in an experimental confrontation with a synth boy at around 10-12 years old to just observe and take notes.
I sure have by now. This is by far my most discussed post on reddit.
And when you go to far harbor they tell you your a synth as well.
    They don't directly say it. DiMA just asks the SS if they think they are a synth.
I mentioned that in my post.  And that it's a stupid, vague reason that doesn't actually explain *why* they did it at all.
    Not wanting loose ends isn't stupid or vague. We literally see what happens with *one* survivor. The institute does not like loose ends.
        But why would anyone who *wasn't* Shaun's parent and Nate/Nora's grieving and enraged spouse have been a loose end?  None of the people in the vault had any reason to act against the Institute until they gave the protagonist two really good ones.

"Loose ends" is a wallpaper explanation covering up a big plot hole.
            >But why would anyone who wasn't Shaun's parent and Nate/Nora's grieving and enraged spouse have been a loose end?

They might not. But they'd just spread more rumors the institute doesn't want.

>"Loose ends" is a wallpaper explanation covering up a big plot hole.

This isn't a plot hole. This fandom needs to learn what a plot hole is. You want a plot hole? How about caesar sending you down into the bunker instead of a frumentarii whose sole job is the exception to caesar's rules?
                Caesar was recruiting the Courier, the only person who has access to the Lucky 38, and testing to see if they'll obey his orders.  With all your railing against people who "don't pay attention" on this post, I'm surprised you missed something so blatantly obvious.
                    >Caesar was recruiting the Courier, the only person who has access to the Lucky 38, and testing to see if they'll obey his orders.

...except the courier needs the chip for house or themself. And so caesar stupidly just hands them over the key and says "yeah bro, you got this". If isn't a test. Because his reason when asked was "i'd have to kill them".

And then, he doesn't even check after you. He just takes a tremor as evidence.

>With all your railing against people who "don't pay attention" on this post, I'm surprised you missed something so blatantly obvious.

The irony cannot be further lost on you. You literally made up a reason. What you said isn't true at all. Because, like i said, his reason is "i'd have to kill them". The courier literally can ask "why can't you just send a legionaire", there is nothing about this being a test. And he does not go check after you. He should have sent a frumentarii, the people who are allowed to touch technology.
I measure nuance in many ways. The problem is the institute doesn’t have strategic nuance or moral ambiguity. There’s very little rationale to anything that they do.

The institute is not interesting in the slightest. The NCR I’ll admit was pretty boring. The Legion is incredibly flawed but it’s still interesting. You think the institute is more interesting than the REPCONN ghouls? That side quest was more interesting than the entire Institute quest line. The Big Mountain scientist team was really dumb but it was still interesting and fun to play through. The institute just sucks. I think Fallout 4 as a whole is sort of sub par but the Institute was outright boring and seemed hastily thrown together.
    >The problem is the institute doesn’t have strategic nuance

They do.

>or moral ambiguity

No, not really. Which...isn't bad. The enclave don't either. Nor the legion.

>There’s very little rationale to anything that they do.

Sure. ...if you don't pay attention. See how it keeps circling back to a lack of audience participation?

>You think the institute is more interesting than the REPCONN ghouls?

Yes. Jason bright's group is...meh. Much like the rest of the game.

>The Big Mountain scientist team was really dumb but it was still interesting and fun to play through

That's subjective.

>but the Institute was outright boring and seemed hastily thrown together.

Yes. The institute. The big bad. The main antagonist. Hastily thrown together. Because that makes sense. ...well i guess it does if you refuse to pay attention.
Those are the neighbors who didn't have a place in the Vault.
    Not all of them, Bust some of them yes
The Institute isn't Vault-tec.
    Ya sure?
        Yes.  The Institute was created by the survivors of the Commonwealth Institute of Technology (aka, non-copyright MIT).  They may have had some projects that were used by the US government before the war, and by extension Vault-tec, but it wasn't affiliated with the company.
            History is written by the survivors.
But would it even feel like kidnapping to the people of Vault 111?  Seriously, if the Institute had thawed your whole family out and taken you back to their safe, clean, and comfortable place to live, and told you that the world above was a blasted hellscape with no real hope of a future, you probably would have been fine with the cost of that being that they occasionally need a blood sample from you or your kid.  To the humans who live there the Institute is what the Vault promised to be.

And just because they're not currently doing any projects that would require a pre-war popsicle doesn't mean they *never* will.  It just seems really short sighted.
    >**And just because they're not currently doing any projects that would require a pre-war popsicle doesn't mean they never will. It just seems really short sighted.**

When I wrote my response to your conjecture, what I meant is the game doesn't establish any narrative or lore that requires them. 

To me, it's like asking why the NCR hasn't built any artillery when they could lore-wise, especially when the game depicts them as something potent. But then I realize that despite it all, it's just there for the sake of the plot, and it doesn't give enough care to expand it in the first place. 

Like, if the game establishes any significant lore that requires them aside from the Synth project, but Shaun killed the people regardless, then I might scratch my head too. However, unless I'm missing some relevant lore, the game doesn't really set anything like that.
No, it was whoever was the director of the Institute when Shaun was kidnapped from the Vault.  Kellogg calls that person "the old man," but he also calls adult!Shaun "the old man" sixty years later, because the writers were trying to preserve the twist that Father was your now adult son.  It makes it awkward and confusing, though.
    It's been a minute I think I remember that
Sorry I got interrupted. Later in the game, they tell you that Sean was the only one that did not have damaged DNA. They also mentioned they tested other members of the vault. The damaged DNA of the other subjects could have come from either the fallout, or from the constant exposure of the nuclear power that powered everything from their cars to their dishwashers. Sean would not have been exposed for that long of a period of time. Therefore his DNA was pure. there were still other survivors in the vault, but their equipment had failed. The fact that your equipment did not fail, and you survived, was pure luck. They would not have any need for anyone after finding a good subject so the knowledge of other people still being in cryogenic freeze became obsolete.
One of them was a drug seller, Like a big time drug seller

                    Correct me if I'm wrong but I seem to recall no dates on the neighboring house's computer journal entries. Maybe that drug dealer is a post war one.
                        The drug dealer was one of Nate's neighbors, His terminal is the one that is connected to a locked safe in Sanctuary
                            Right I just checked and even without dates, the dealer reference connections in the army, a potential cop under cover, definitly pre-war, my bad.

    I don't think he was one of the ones who made it into the vault, though?
        No.  If I remember correctly, the name on his mailbox is Hawthorne, which is the same name as one of the wealthy families in Diamond City.  The adventurer you meet when you first walk into the Dugout Inn is one of them.
    Nah, Nate is the biggest jet pusher in the commonwealth.

Deffs better then the other group of neighbors, those guys try ro eat your skin.
This goes especially well with all the promotional imagery of 111s door stating "societal preservation vault"
I think all the neighbors die, they're outside the gates when you enter the vault and then near diamond city the named ghouls are the neighbors
That coupled with sim settlements would of made the settlement system a lot more compelling
Don’t most people do stuff with sanctuary cause of Preston and gang?

    That's the very reason I go elsewhere actually.
        Touché
How's it relevant to their power issues, though? Vault 111 has completely seperate generators from the Institute.
    Read the terminal entries. The staff were having trouble keeping the vault going from the start. Issues with the pods as well
        This is the comment I was looking for, I remmember it being actual technical problems that were preventing the facility to keep working correctly.
            Yeah. Institute probably pushed it over the edge waking Nate and Nora up
    They're worried about the power grid holding up after 150+ years, especially if they need it running another 50+. 

Because their experience taught them it can be a problem.
"And the reward for that Vault run was horse-armor. HORSE-ARMOR!!! Who does that?!"
how/where? not arguing, genuinely curious
    There's a note in Overseer's log about hiccups in the system thawing people early, and concern about how long the systems will work after they evacuate. Combine that with the Institutes fanatical power conservation efforts until Phase 3. 

The only statement is about "loose ends" but that's Kellogg talking and he'd be concerned about tying up loose ends much more than the scientists, and he's obviously not tying them all up as you survive. 

So when you consider the scientists made sure to shut down all the pods they didn't need, the power issues at the institute, and the known hiccup in the system with the overseer concerned about how long the pods will last (not power related, but an issue) and it's been 150 years most without maintenance (there's radroaches in the reactor by the time you wake up).

There's also Shaun's answer about why re-freeze you specifically, comments about how long the power has been an issue, and specifically that they killed the residents by turning off the power. 

Take it all together, it's the most likely explanation, they do definitely imply that's what happened.

Edit: I also feel like there's a few more conversations in the Institute that lead that way, but I can't remember the specifics. There's a few interesting tidbits in there that confirm things, like why Nora can fight the way she does if you talk to everyone.
    for me, it’s the most logical conclusion given the info provided hah i guess it’s a bit of contextual storytelling.
There's absolutely no terminal entry that says that.
    There actually is a line in the Overseer's instructions that reads "Unused cryogenic pods are the preferred method for cadaver disposal."
        I feel that's more so corpses don't rot, not that the pod itself is designed to kill you
    Once all residents have been sealed into their preservation chambers dispose of any detainees. Vault entryway must remain sealed under any circumstances. -Overseer Terminal
        Detainees are people that have been held for jumping the gate. 

That doesn't mean the people in the tubes.

    I had that once, Painfull
Fallout was gold. These days we have leveled enemies and weapons in action-adventure open-world games and they call it RPG (ehm Assassin's Creed, witcher, Hogwarts Legacy, ...)

At least fallout let's me disarm a nuke or fuck over a town if I please.
The Institute ends up basically doing every possible wrong thing and it's honestly quite annoying.
It feels like the devs were working off a first draft from the writing team.
    I feel like they just went with generic b movie scifi villains.  They needed a good twist like actually replacing people to stop some other larger scope problems the other factions ignor or aren't capable of dealing with.
        To stop the spread of some new strain of pre-war plague or something. Something close to origins of FEV, that was originally developed no as a "super soldier serum", but a way to stop the disease.

I believe that plague was the central part of cancelled Van Buren, if I am not mistaken.
            Yeah that was the ultimate plot.  The pc was a carrier and would infect every settlement they encountered while the bad guys chasing you were trying to quarantine the plauge.

The ending had the pc having to pick the places the cure would go while nuking the rest iirc.

I also like the setup for 76 with the scorched plague.  It's backstory is more interesting than most games main quest and it's a shame bethesda didn't go with it as 76s main story instead of cleaning up the mess
                Not exactly. Creating a cure for plague was a separate sub-plot. It was the automated and malfunctioning prison system that was trying to bring you and other prisoners back. You needed all of them back yourself to deactivate it.

Bad guy was a mad ex-NCR scientist monitoring you actions and willing to bombard the living crap outta USA.

Final decision - pick an area to sacrifice using BOMB space station (same as one if FO76's crater) as you were too late to stop the launch.

In essence, that scientist became a prototype for Father Elijah from Dead Money.

With some adjustments, Van Buren could work as a perfect New Vegas prequel, given a lot of characters!/events/locations/factions are still mentioned inNew Vegas.

As for FO76, I still wish it was a proper SP spin-off. It had a huge potential and in most aspects I still like it more than FO4.
                    They used some of the Van Buren plot for Fallout 76, and some in the New Vegas Lonesome Road DLC.

The mad scientist was deliberately trying to spread the plague, since this was the only way to raise the automated 'alert' level so he could unlock the BOMB satellites.    His motivation was essentially the same as Ulysses in Lonesome Road - he wanted to wipe away the existing societies to start again from scratch.
        > I feel like they just went with generic b movie scifi villains.

That's because they are, it's the only way to actually advance technology.  See my [theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/11ohbon/comment/jbtbu3m/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) above...
The institute has reasons for what they do. Don't listen to people who don't pay attention.
    What are those reasons?
        The institute sends super mutants to the surface to keep it destabilized. A unified surface brings in a threat to the institute (just look at the minutemen or brotherhood or railroad who are all unified factions that can take on the institute). It also allows the region to remain relatively stagnant, allowing the institute free reign of resources.

They also replace people for political reasons. Like mcdonough. Or to oversee projects. Like roger Warwick.
            Lmao, the only reason they're a threat to the institute is because the institute is killing and replacing random fuckin people. It's not exactly a chicken/egg situation.
                Yes. They're imperialists. Empires/imperialists tend to create enemies.
                    No they're not, they're isolationists. They want nothing to do with the surface, by their account. So why do they keep doing things to make the surface hate them?
                        Because they are the Think Tank played (somewhat) straight.  A lot of the things they do have no other purpose than to be weird, directionless science experiments.
                        There are different forms of imperialism. Remember when the u.s. said they were entering an isolationist phase and still conquered islands and such?

>So why do they keep doing things to make the surface hate them?

Because they *want* to be hated. /s

They require resources. Just like every society. So they do what they can to keep those resources out of everyone's hands but theirs.
                            They're really not imperialists, Shaun literally says they want to wait for the surfacers to die out. And iirc the only outside resource they ever needed was the mass fusion generator, before that they were self sufficient. Occasionally they recruited scientists from the surface. But we never see them gathering resources.

Imo the biggest problem with the Institute's motivation is why they made the synths. They say they're working on humanity's evolution, which would imply they want synths to replace humans. But if that's true, why do they deny synth sentience and use them as slaves?
                    I think people just weren't in the mood for an Ivy League Enclave.
                        they're not like the enclave.
                            No? A technologically superior pre-war holdout group that is comically evil when it doesn't benefit them at all and thinks of all human life outside their small community as expendable, and wants to perpetuate the worst of the pre-war culture that caused the war in the first place. And their primary interest in the player character is due to their genetic purity. That doesn't remind you the tiniest bit of the Enclave?
            > just look at the minutemen or brotherhood or railroad who are all unified factions that can take on the institute

Because the institute are objectively evil because of their constant actions, you're saying the reason they do their evil actions is because of the consequences of their evil actions
                ...no, they do their actions because they're evil. but they do have reasons that aren't "oh we're evil". sending super mutants to the surface isn't "we're evil" it's "we don't want anyone to be able to unite against us".
                    Are you trying to say that intentionally creating murderous mutants to send to terrorize people isn't evil?
                        It is. But their *reasoning* is *not* "we are doing it because we are evil". They do not think they are evil. They *justify* it or have different reasons for it.
                            Dude nobody is saying the Institute doesn't self rationalize their stupid evil tendencies. People are saying they would prefer is there was actual nuance instead of stupid evil. Personally I would have preferred an Institute that has screwed up BECAUSE they are trying to help the surface without interacting with it. Would have been interesting where you spend almost the whole game expecting some Cabal of evil mad scientists just to arrive and find out they are just way out of the depth.
                            If as you say their justification is to prevent people uniting against them, then it makes zero sense, because the whole reason why factions like the minutement are uniting against them is BECAUSE what they're doing is evil.
            I cant believe you are being downvoted for talking actual lore.

Im with you my man
                Because this fanbase hates the lore and likes to make up their own.
                    Lmao man, I'll be honest, everyone knows the Institute justifies it themselves. The justification is all ass cause none of it makes sense. You seem to fail to realize that just because the writing gives a reason doesn't automatically make it good. 

This is why people say the writing is poor, cause sure, the Institute says they have reasons, but when you scrutinize them, you realize the reasons make no fucking sense. **You've also failed to acknowledge that the Institute's goal is to help the Commonwealth and use science to better the post war world**. 

That's something they establish to you once you become leader of the institute. So let's breakdown some of their actions and see how well does it serve the goal mentioned above. 

They made supermutants to destabilize the area so that no one would oppose them. Okay, but why exactly? The Institute themselves have stated they were focused on their research and advancing it, but they clearly don't have plans for world domination. Why do they *need* to destabilize an entire region? How does that serve their goals in research? They state they want to make a better world, one more similar to the pre-war Era, but then they create an entire faction of super mutants who then actively ruin the Commonwealth? 

Even then, how does fucking over other factions hurt them? The altruistic minute men could have been used to meet the goal of making the Commonwealth better. The Railroad wouldn't have needed to exist had they adopted a less blatantly brain dead outlook on synths. "Let's create synths who can act, feel, and be human but oh, they just aren't human to us!" The only faction that would seriously oppose them is the BoS yet the super mutants weren't a problem for them. The BoS are outsiders, they didn't have a real establishment in the Commonwealth til the event of Fallout 4. So the release of super mutants just fucked over the only factions that could have worked with them, and also just fucked over the Commonwealth incredibly. Not to mention that it makes their synths ' job of finding and salvaging significantly harder now. Like, creating super mutants was by far the dumbest thing they did cause it's like dumping a bucket of soap to clean a spill. Sure itl clean the spill, but now there's a bucket of soap you need to clean up. 

Kidnapping people is also fucking bizarre because again, it makes no sense. What's the end goal? Sure, you can argue they kidnap political figures but it's not even that. We see that they straight up kidnap random ass people too and replace them. Tell me, what purpose **that serves the Institute 'a goals** does kidnapping a random farmer do? They argue that they actually are taking valued individuals which makes even less sense. Why would you risk exposing your secret organization by taking in a bunch of randoms and then replace them? You literally had an entire vault of frozen folk, some of which were alive, and killed them. Even then, they had the ability to create sentient beings with potentially mechanical skillets. **Why would you not use the fucking intelligent robot beings to cover any logistical internal staffing?**

Again, the Institute would have been fine had they been openly more evil with their ambitions. But no, you meet them and they mostly just want to continue their research. What they *do* and what they *want* fail to align, hence why people say that the Institute is a shallow, immoral organization.
                        >You've also failed to acknowledge that the Institute's goal is to help the Commonwealth and use science to better the post war world

...no. It's not. Their entire questline involves them getting the necessary requirements to have their own power independence and thrive *underground* while they leave the surface in squalor because they see it as an irredeemable hell.

I...am not sure i want to waste my breath on the rest of your comment after this. Honestly.
                            If they plan on thriving underground, why did they destabilize the surface?
                            >...no. It's not. Their entire questline involves them getting the necessary requirements to have their own power independence and thrive underground while they leave the surface in squalor because they see it as an irredeemable hell.

Except that's not their only goal. They straight up tell you they want to "help the Commonwealth" or that the "Commonwealth will have nothing to fear," at times. This is why I said they are poorly written. Their goals are that they want to help the Commonwealth but also they want to stay isolated away from it cause they view it to be unredeemable. They think the people are savages yet they take them or experiment on them. They believe that their brand new synths can be used to replace human beings yet somehow view them as if they were still bumbling, obvious robots that can't at all be anything resembling human.

Father himself states that the Institute is trying to redefine mankind. What does that even mean if they also view their human like creations as not human whatsoever. Not to mention that Father will actually have the Institute form Public relations if you can convince him.

This is also a tendency shown by the game that the Institute fails to consolidate a single goal because they don't genuinely have a solid goal to reach. 

Even then, their goal of staying underground and being independent is still not at all aligned with their actions. Why do they want to stay away from everybody if they actively antagonize people? Why release super mutants into the area that makes things worse for everyone involved and is a super huge risk? Why not just do what needs to be done cause we actively don't see *any* benefit for the Institute in replacing people at all. Sure, they can act as spies, but **why do they need spies in the first place? They have synths who can replace humans, so why don't they just integrate them into societies rather than kidnapping people like a comic villain**? They can make their own super synths that are super human that would obviously, and so clearly be able to become incredibly well-respected in places like Diamond City yet they choose to just steal people, turn them into super mutants, and make a whole ass new synth to replace them? 

Even then, their replacements are genuinely ass considering how often people notice it.

If they want to just be left alone, why do they actively not try to do that? Had they just done everything silently, nobody would have known about anything. They have all the resources to create their own army, gorillas, and humans yet they somehow didn't opt to just, not do things the easy way? It's supposed to show that the Institute is full of a bunch of narcissists and cynics, but at the same time it just makes the Institute incredibly incompetent. If their main goal was independence, why are they actively making themselves known to the world and also choosing to piss them off rather than work with them? There's a difference between thinking the world above is unsalvageable and another to commit mass murder.

None of it makes sense because the two things we hear about what the Institute wants doesn't match their actions. They want to stay secluded and do their own thing? Then why do the actively antagonize people outside causing ire against them and thus leading to their downfall? Why do they kidnap people and experiment on them to make super mutants? Why make super mutants and actually make the job of salvaging worse by letting them take over multiple areas of the game? This is made worse considering they literally have the most secure entrance before the Sole Survivor comes in. They are virtually untouchable yet they keep acting as if they aren't and proceed to make the most absurd evil decisions that guarantee that the Commonwealth wants them dead. 

They also tell you they want to help the Commonwealth and obviously what they do doesn't at all align with that nonsense. 

So both goals that have been interpreted by the community (because again, the Institute is a walking narrative mess on heels that is forced to be comically evil yet somehow incredibly incompetent) fail to at all align with their goals. 

Also yeah, somehow hitting enter just sent the comment for whatever reason lmao.
                    How would anyone unite against the institute if no one knows they exist and the only way in is a teleporter? In what way are they threatened? And before that they were at risk of what? The minute men becoming a major player, the only unambiguously good faction? Wouldn't their whole plan would have made more sense to help the minute men and then leverege the favors for power?
                        >How would anyone unite against the institute if no one knows they exist and the only way in is a teleporter? In what way are they threatened?

...the railroad and brotherhood and minutemen all fought against the institute without knowledge of their base or teleportation. The minutemen even was a force to reckon with against the institute at one point.

However, the unification doesn't have to be directly threatening. It could make it harder for the institute to replace key people. Or get parts for their projects. Etc.

>Wouldn't their whole plan would have made more sense to help the minute men and then leverege the favors for power?

Why would they help the minutemen? Who went against them in the past?
                            We are back to the circular logic problem of the institute. Everyone hates them because they were assholes and then that justifies them being assholes. If they didn't suck and stayed to true to either goal, helping the wasteland like you get told when you take over. Or two just stayed underground and worked to establish their own power grid. Neither of those goals require the super mutants, neither requires kidnapping. And as someone else said, why even make synths this smart? Just stop like one generation ago and they would have largely avoided the whole robot slavery problem but still had a free labor pool. Most of the time it seems the best explanation for why, is that it seems the writers needed it that way, and that's bad writing
                    Indeed, i stopped correcting people here becuase they literally refuse actual lore with source, and rather upvote shitty theories like the player being a synth or pretend that NV is a flawless game.

Science isn't about why. It's about WHY NOT!
Technically, if we consider cancelled Fallout games such as Van Buren, didn't VaultTec have ties with the Enclave? Wasn't collecting data on humans' survivability in extreme environments the purpose of their experiments to use later for colonising a new planet?

Big MT went awry due to robo-brain tech for life extension being rather unstable. Scientists literally went mad.

What's wrong with Mr. House? Besides his inability to accept status of NCR citizen and actually try working things out with BoS, his logic is pretty sound.

Um, he's still there or were you being facetious? He is the lead designer on Starfield. Unfortunatley.

....wow dude.  I'm not the OP or who you're commenting on.  But I think I speak for everyone when I say.  We appreciate your passion.  That's super cool that you liked it so much and understood it so well!  Sounds like you had a great experience with Fallout 4.  So did I!    


But he's allowed to have his opinion about the story.   That's kinda how it works.  We can all experience different things in our own ways and have our opinions on it.  And that's ok.  


It doesn't take away from your experience, your enjoyment of the story...or your opinion of the story.
    >But he's allowed to have his opinion about the story

Sure. But an ignorant opinion (because they refuse to pay attention) is not a valid one.

You might as well say i'm allowed my ignorant opinion on, say, shawshank redemption. Didn't pay attention to it, but i *could* say it is the worst movie to ever exist and is poorly written. How is it poorly written? Idk, i didn't pay attention. That's not how this works, though. If you refuse to pay attention, but then act like the writing **is** flawed...your claim is invalid.
        Or....he just views it differently then you.  and he didn't like explanations that maybe you did.  Or things that felt like they fit like a glove to you....felt forced to him.  that's kind of how differences of opinions work.  Hell...it's given you something to talk about this morning/eevening, so aren't differences of opinions beneficial?
            Mr. Benjamin_Starscape is being really aggressively argumentative all over the post.  Not just disagreeing with people, but calling everyone with a differing opinion "ignorant" like it's on his word of the day calendar.  And when someone offers a rebuttal to his points, he ignores the point they made to call them stupid a second time.
                I'm not a guy. And i'm not calling anyone ignorant. I'm calling their "opinions" ignorant because it shows they didn't pay attention.
                    Sorry for assuming, I made an educated guess since you have a masculine screenname.  But male, female, both, or neither, you're still being *really obnoxious* on this post.
                        all i'm asking for is that people pay attention to the media they consume. if that's obnoxious, sue me.
                            You're assuming that *your* interpretations are the only correct ones, and *everyone* who came to a different conclusion than you simply didn't "pay attention."  And complaining that the fandom has gotten dumb because some people are disagreeing with you.

Do you not see how that's obnoxious?
            Ignorant opinions aren't beneficial. They only spread ignorance and make the audience dumber. This fanbase has gotten dumber. Audiences overall have gotten dumber. Gamers as a whole do not pay attention.

You shouldn't let ignorance go under "it's just an opinion". It breeds ignorance.
                You seem like the kind of guy that thinks you need an especially high IQ, such as yours, to understand the nuances of Rick and Morty.
                    I'm not a guy, iq is not a good measure of intellect, and i don't find rick and morty nuanced or funny or good.

You made an awful lot of assumptions that were all wrong. If saying you should pay attention, the most basic ask for the audience, feels like you need a high iq...idk what to really tell you.

Because literally all i'm telling people is to *pay attention*.
                        It was a joke that clearly sailed a few thousand feet above your head but alright.
                            Or it just wasn't a good joke.
        You are allowed your ignorant opinion on Shawshank. You are allowed to have any opinion on anything you want. That’s the neat thing about opinions.
            >You are allowed your ignorant opinion on Shawshank

No! No, i am not. In that example i refused to pay attention and then criticized it. That is *not* okay. Criticism through ignorance is not criticism.
        grow the fuck up.
            Yes. *i'm* the one who needs to grow up.
                yes, you are. you're acting like a petulant child.
                    I mean they are almost certainly 11
                    ...because i don't like comments that spread misinformation due to the commenter not paying attention?
                        Bro is calling opinions misinformation lmao it's not that deep dude it's a video game
                            video games are a form of art. the same as books, movies, and paintings. saying that the game has bad writing based on nothing other than you not paying attention *is* misinformation.

it's also, again, not an opinion. it's just ignorance. plain ignorance. which would easily be fixed by the most basic of audience participation...paying attention. it's not some huge ask.
Which is especially funny when you consider that as Sole & family entered the vault a nuke went off so close to them that they were hit with the initial wave as the elevator descended, *and* that everything on the surfacer world pre-war most likely had radioactive contamination because none of the companies operating there were interested in making things correctly.

Hell my Sole is addicted to Nuka Quantum, which is basically what if radiation was a cool blue drink lol.
Ahh my bad, I remembered that they were in isolation since before the bombs dropped.
That would be a great premise for an AU fanfic.
    Haha yes now if only I can learn to draw people properly I'd make it into a comic
I really like this a lot. 

But if the intro/tutorial was a second longer I'd lose my mind.
    I don't think it needs to be much longer for my idea to work. Then again most of the time I end up running into those other rooms anyway so I wouldn't have trouble spending another couple seconds picking up some friends. I guess that last cutscene with them arguing could lengthen it a little but hopefully not too much.
        Have one settler ask "do you know what happened here?!"

Then pick a dialogue option:

1: Yes, follow me! We'll find our families, I promise. [Skips tutorial, you exit straight to the elevator ride]

2: I... no. We'd better look around and figure out what's going on. [You play the tutorial/ explore the vault]

I'd play this as an alternative intro mod!
            Yess
Adults can fight back and resist, an infant can be molded and controlled easily.
    Why would they though? In an apocalypse, the Institute offers shelter, food, and modern conveniences. And they wouldn’t know anything about them being sketchy.

I think Cap Collector is just magical, honestly.
But no Pipe pistols in DC or the Mojave. It's a shit retcon to explain their mistake.
    Maybe Boston just had someone actually bothering with making pipe guns which then spread all over the place.
The shear audacity of it. Poor Cogsworth almost blew a fuse last time he did it.
An entire vault's worth of prewar survivors, each of them potentially useful in future, not to mention that they are already useful as is, not least of which because you already knew they weren't going anywhere, who already had strenuous Vault Tec med screenings.

The breadth and depth of ways that would be useful to a group of science nerds is too much to count.

Killing the entire vault's population, even sabotaging the ongoing cryogenics test, was not only evil, but stupid evil. It's not even 'tying up loose ends' because there were at least three additional rooms of viable dwellers worth of very useful potential candidates, to say nothing of the premium foolishness of killing them all _but_ you for sake of a backup.

You had an entire vault full of backups, and now you only have one. Way to go, Institute Director Dumbass.
    The Institute has been shown to be uncaring and xenophobic towards to surface population. Which leads to things such as massacring whole towns/vaults, which is shown throughout our own history, “war never changes”. I wouldn’t even call it stupid/cartoonishly evil because that has happened in our own history, people who think of people as lesser will just kill them because they think they’re superior. Another one of the institutes flaws is that their arrogance blinds them and makes them do stupid things, which could also explain the vault dwellers being killed. 

And the Backup needed to have the same DNA as Shaun, IIRC that was mentioned at the end of the Battle of Bunker Hill quest
        I agree with this POV in principle - the final talk with Shaun on the building where he goes "yep civilisations is destroyed look at this" and your Sole doesn't get to bring up ANY of the world they're doing to rebuild is stupid but shows how single-minded the Institute is with regards to their own superiority...

...But it doesn't explain their ultimate goal. Like at all. Do they want to retake the surface? Remain underground forever? Well then why do they keep sabotaging the surface? Why did they make super mutants? Why are they replacing surface people with synths? What's the *point* of it all? Even if you become Director there's no real explanation of their exact end goal and it's so frustrating. At least Minutemen = rebuild Commonweath, Railroad = rescue all synths, BOS = exterminate technological threats. Institute = ??????????? uhhh cool robots. Or something.
            Yep. 'What does the Institute *want*' is the driving question of the game, and  unlike the clear and defined goals of everyone else, the Institute is this vague and hazy nebulous blob of science nerds who have spent the last two centuries peeing in everyone else's cornflakes for no clear goal or reason.

I suspect, that in much the same way the Gunners are a reskin of Talon Company, the Institute was originally going to be a reskin of the FO3 Enclave- unambiguously bad guy nazi-likes that you can mow down without guilt or remorse.

Then New Vegas came out, and people loved and still love to this day, the fact that you can support anyone and have fairly cogent arguments for all the factions, much like Daggerfall. ^(Ceaser's Legion is a bunch of losers and a dead end ideology though.)

So I imagine that Emil decided to retool the factions drastically *after* they had already started development, and that's why the Institute is so.... nebulous.
Thats like asking what psychopath thought it would be a good idea to put keyed locks on a first aid kit
How does it make no sense? It's okay to not like the story but, seriously. They're both old men who had pretty much the same relationship with Kellogg as Kellogg physically stayed the same age. Does it actually make NO sense that he would refer to them both as the old man?
    Okay, maybe it doesn't actually make *zero* sense, but I still think it was awkwardly written to preserve the twist.  I feel like if Kellogg had called them both "the Director" it would have worked better.
        I agree that would probably have worked a bit better. I think it's only really awkward because he refers to them as "the" old man but, I don't think it's really that weird I mean being nicknamed "old man" or "the kid" is not super uncommon
See, and I find it to be the theory that makes the most sense. 

I mean, why else would Father finally release his parent, after so many years, only to leave them to wander completely unprepared and alone in a very, very dangerous environment, with almost no supplies or weapons to start out with. It would be an almost guaranteed horrible death for anybody else. Why go through that whole charade of the child synth in Diamond City with Kellogg to use as bait. Kellogg was an extremely dangerous mercenary. And true, Nate was a soldier, but Nora was a lawyer. Either way, it was an extremely risky and dangerous thing to make your parent do for no reason other then to see if your parent would get revenge. I know that Shawn wanted to get revenge on Kellogg, but I'm sure there were many, many possible ways to do so without using such a convoluted made up rescue fantasy. Unless the parent was unwittingly a synth with courser-like strength and abilities. 

My headcanon is that when they resealed the vault, they did it improperly, and everybody died. Father had some serious Daddy/Mommy issues, and daydreamed his whole life about his non-shot parent somehow surviving, and wondered just how far they'd go to rescue him, because they loved him. Then, when he realized he was dying, he needed a worthy successor. Why not kill two birds with one stone? He could create a customized synth that would basically be their parent, one that would adapt and grow more powerful. He would get to live out his fantasy of his parent's loving crusade to find him, plus a few extra loose ends tied up and a healthy dose of poetic revenge in the process. And, to top it all off, when the parent does arrive in the Institute, they meet a child replica of Shawn, while the real one observed in the other room. It was obvious that Father really, really wanted to see his fantasy of his parent swooping in and saving the child him, even if it was just observing it. Obviously, that didn't quite work out. 

As for his views on synths, it wouldn't really matter, as this synth was obviously different then the others. It was HIS. It was perfect. And it was his masterpiece and his dream made real. It could be a secret project that the majority of the institute was unaware of, or it could be that this synth was hyped up to be humanity perfected, unlike the other inferior models. But Shawn would have his answer. How it felt to be loved. And if his beloved parent would approve of his life's work, or if he would have disappointed them utterly.
Not sure what version you're playing. It's in my version on XBox. Every single time. They put it back in.
    Well, you're the only one. It was not in any of my playthroughs and the wiki still lists it as inaccessible. You sure you're not using mods?
        I use mods, definitely, but the terminal entry in question was actually in the original game. Some derp programmer at Bethesda forgot to "turn it on" (according to YouTuber JuiceHead). This was rectified with the release of Far Harbor in 2016. If you play the game without Far Harbor, that entry will not be there.

The wiki may list it as cut content, but it was restored with Far Harbor. Kinda makes DiMA's suggestion that you could be a synth a pretty obvious hint.
            I have played the game with Far Harbor. And this youtuber can read minds apparently and know what unknown developers were thinking?
                Okay, cool then. Prove me wrong. Next time you play, check out all the terminals in Robotics at The Institute.
                    I have checked all the terminals in the Institute.
                        Also checked - not there.
They don't directly say it. DiMA just asks the SS if they think they are a synth.
Not wanting loose ends isn't stupid or vague. We literally see what happens with *one* survivor. The institute does not like loose ends.
    But why would anyone who *wasn't* Shaun's parent and Nate/Nora's grieving and enraged spouse have been a loose end?  None of the people in the vault had any reason to act against the Institute until they gave the protagonist two really good ones.

"Loose ends" is a wallpaper explanation covering up a big plot hole.
        >But why would anyone who wasn't Shaun's parent and Nate/Nora's grieving and enraged spouse have been a loose end?

They might not. But they'd just spread more rumors the institute doesn't want.

>"Loose ends" is a wallpaper explanation covering up a big plot hole.

This isn't a plot hole. This fandom needs to learn what a plot hole is. You want a plot hole? How about caesar sending you down into the bunker instead of a frumentarii whose sole job is the exception to caesar's rules?
            Caesar was recruiting the Courier, the only person who has access to the Lucky 38, and testing to see if they'll obey his orders.  With all your railing against people who "don't pay attention" on this post, I'm surprised you missed something so blatantly obvious.
                >Caesar was recruiting the Courier, the only person who has access to the Lucky 38, and testing to see if they'll obey his orders.

...except the courier needs the chip for house or themself. And so caesar stupidly just hands them over the key and says "yeah bro, you got this". If isn't a test. Because his reason when asked was "i'd have to kill them".

And then, he doesn't even check after you. He just takes a tremor as evidence.

>With all your railing against people who "don't pay attention" on this post, I'm surprised you missed something so blatantly obvious.

The irony cannot be further lost on you. You literally made up a reason. What you said isn't true at all. Because, like i said, his reason is "i'd have to kill them". The courier literally can ask "why can't you just send a legionaire", there is nothing about this being a test. And he does not go check after you. He should have sent a frumentarii, the people who are allowed to touch technology.
>The problem is the institute doesn’t have strategic nuance

They do.

>or moral ambiguity

No, not really. Which...isn't bad. The enclave don't either. Nor the legion.

>There’s very little rationale to anything that they do.

Sure. ...if you don't pay attention. See how it keeps circling back to a lack of audience participation?

>You think the institute is more interesting than the REPCONN ghouls?

Yes. Jason bright's group is...meh. Much like the rest of the game.

>The Big Mountain scientist team was really dumb but it was still interesting and fun to play through

That's subjective.

>but the Institute was outright boring and seemed hastily thrown together.

Yes. The institute. The big bad. The main antagonist. Hastily thrown together. Because that makes sense. ...well i guess it does if you refuse to pay attention.
Not all of them, Bust some of them yes
Ya sure?
    Yes.  The Institute was created by the survivors of the Commonwealth Institute of Technology (aka, non-copyright MIT).  They may have had some projects that were used by the US government before the war, and by extension Vault-tec, but it wasn't affiliated with the company.
        History is written by the survivors.
>**And just because they're not currently doing any projects that would require a pre-war popsicle doesn't mean they never will. It just seems really short sighted.**

When I wrote my response to your conjecture, what I meant is the game doesn't establish any narrative or lore that requires them. 

To me, it's like asking why the NCR hasn't built any artillery when they could lore-wise, especially when the game depicts them as something potent. But then I realize that despite it all, it's just there for the sake of the plot, and it doesn't give enough care to expand it in the first place. 

Like, if the game establishes any significant lore that requires them aside from the Synth project, but Shaun killed the people regardless, then I might scratch my head too. However, unless I'm missing some relevant lore, the game doesn't really set anything like that.

    No.  If I remember correctly, the name on his mailbox is Hawthorne, which is the same name as one of the wealthy families in Diamond City.  The adventurer you meet when you first walk into the Dugout Inn is one of them.

That's the very reason I go elsewhere actually.
    Touché
Read the terminal entries. The staff were having trouble keeping the vault going from the start. Issues with the pods as well
    This is the comment I was looking for, I remmember it being actual technical problems that were preventing the facility to keep working correctly.
        Yeah. Institute probably pushed it over the edge waking Nate and Nora up
They're worried about the power grid holding up after 150+ years, especially if they need it running another 50+. 

Because their experience taught them it can be a problem.
There's a note in Overseer's log about hiccups in the system thawing people early, and concern about how long the systems will work after they evacuate. Combine that with the Institutes fanatical power conservation efforts until Phase 3. 

The only statement is about "loose ends" but that's Kellogg talking and he'd be concerned about tying up loose ends much more than the scientists, and he's obviously not tying them all up as you survive. 

So when you consider the scientists made sure to shut down all the pods they didn't need, the power issues at the institute, and the known hiccup in the system with the overseer concerned about how long the pods will last (not power related, but an issue) and it's been 150 years most without maintenance (there's radroaches in the reactor by the time you wake up).

There's also Shaun's answer about why re-freeze you specifically, comments about how long the power has been an issue, and specifically that they killed the residents by turning off the power. 

Take it all together, it's the most likely explanation, they do definitely imply that's what happened.

Edit: I also feel like there's a few more conversations in the Institute that lead that way, but I can't remember the specifics. There's a few interesting tidbits in there that confirm things, like why Nora can fight the way she does if you talk to everyone.
for me, it’s the most logical conclusion given the info provided hah i guess it’s a bit of contextual storytelling.
There actually is a line in the Overseer's instructions that reads "Unused cryogenic pods are the preferred method for cadaver disposal."
    I feel that's more so corpses don't rot, not that the pod itself is designed to kill you
Once all residents have been sealed into their preservation chambers dispose of any detainees. Vault entryway must remain sealed under any circumstances. -Overseer Terminal
    Detainees are people that have been held for jumping the gate. 

That doesn't mean the people in the tubes.
I had that once, Painfull
I feel like they just went with generic b movie scifi villains.  They needed a good twist like actually replacing people to stop some other larger scope problems the other factions ignor or aren't capable of dealing with.
    To stop the spread of some new strain of pre-war plague or something. Something close to origins of FEV, that was originally developed no as a "super soldier serum", but a way to stop the disease.

I believe that plague was the central part of cancelled Van Buren, if I am not mistaken.
        Yeah that was the ultimate plot.  The pc was a carrier and would infect every settlement they encountered while the bad guys chasing you were trying to quarantine the plauge.

The ending had the pc having to pick the places the cure would go while nuking the rest iirc.

I also like the setup for 76 with the scorched plague.  It's backstory is more interesting than most games main quest and it's a shame bethesda didn't go with it as 76s main story instead of cleaning up the mess
            Not exactly. Creating a cure for plague was a separate sub-plot. It was the automated and malfunctioning prison system that was trying to bring you and other prisoners back. You needed all of them back yourself to deactivate it.

Bad guy was a mad ex-NCR scientist monitoring you actions and willing to bombard the living crap outta USA.

Final decision - pick an area to sacrifice using BOMB space station (same as one if FO76's crater) as you were too late to stop the launch.

In essence, that scientist became a prototype for Father Elijah from Dead Money.

With some adjustments, Van Buren could work as a perfect New Vegas prequel, given a lot of characters!/events/locations/factions are still mentioned inNew Vegas.

As for FO76, I still wish it was a proper SP spin-off. It had a huge potential and in most aspects I still like it more than FO4.
                They used some of the Van Buren plot for Fallout 76, and some in the New Vegas Lonesome Road DLC.

The mad scientist was deliberately trying to spread the plague, since this was the only way to raise the automated 'alert' level so he could unlock the BOMB satellites.    His motivation was essentially the same as Ulysses in Lonesome Road - he wanted to wipe away the existing societies to start again from scratch.
    > I feel like they just went with generic b movie scifi villains.

That's because they are, it's the only way to actually advance technology.  See my [theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/11ohbon/comment/jbtbu3m/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) above...
What are those reasons?
    The institute sends super mutants to the surface to keep it destabilized. A unified surface brings in a threat to the institute (just look at the minutemen or brotherhood or railroad who are all unified factions that can take on the institute). It also allows the region to remain relatively stagnant, allowing the institute free reign of resources.

They also replace people for political reasons. Like mcdonough. Or to oversee projects. Like roger Warwick.
        Lmao, the only reason they're a threat to the institute is because the institute is killing and replacing random fuckin people. It's not exactly a chicken/egg situation.
            Yes. They're imperialists. Empires/imperialists tend to create enemies.
                No they're not, they're isolationists. They want nothing to do with the surface, by their account. So why do they keep doing things to make the surface hate them?
                    Because they are the Think Tank played (somewhat) straight.  A lot of the things they do have no other purpose than to be weird, directionless science experiments.
                    There are different forms of imperialism. Remember when the u.s. said they were entering an isolationist phase and still conquered islands and such?

>So why do they keep doing things to make the surface hate them?

Because they *want* to be hated. /s

They require resources. Just like every society. So they do what they can to keep those resources out of everyone's hands but theirs.
                        They're really not imperialists, Shaun literally says they want to wait for the surfacers to die out. And iirc the only outside resource they ever needed was the mass fusion generator, before that they were self sufficient. Occasionally they recruited scientists from the surface. But we never see them gathering resources.

Imo the biggest problem with the Institute's motivation is why they made the synths. They say they're working on humanity's evolution, which would imply they want synths to replace humans. But if that's true, why do they deny synth sentience and use them as slaves?
                I think people just weren't in the mood for an Ivy League Enclave.
                    they're not like the enclave.
                        No? A technologically superior pre-war holdout group that is comically evil when it doesn't benefit them at all and thinks of all human life outside their small community as expendable, and wants to perpetuate the worst of the pre-war culture that caused the war in the first place. And their primary interest in the player character is due to their genetic purity. That doesn't remind you the tiniest bit of the Enclave?
        > just look at the minutemen or brotherhood or railroad who are all unified factions that can take on the institute

Because the institute are objectively evil because of their constant actions, you're saying the reason they do their evil actions is because of the consequences of their evil actions
            ...no, they do their actions because they're evil. but they do have reasons that aren't "oh we're evil". sending super mutants to the surface isn't "we're evil" it's "we don't want anyone to be able to unite against us".
                Are you trying to say that intentionally creating murderous mutants to send to terrorize people isn't evil?
                    It is. But their *reasoning* is *not* "we are doing it because we are evil". They do not think they are evil. They *justify* it or have different reasons for it.
                        Dude nobody is saying the Institute doesn't self rationalize their stupid evil tendencies. People are saying they would prefer is there was actual nuance instead of stupid evil. Personally I would have preferred an Institute that has screwed up BECAUSE they are trying to help the surface without interacting with it. Would have been interesting where you spend almost the whole game expecting some Cabal of evil mad scientists just to arrive and find out they are just way out of the depth.
                        If as you say their justification is to prevent people uniting against them, then it makes zero sense, because the whole reason why factions like the minutement are uniting against them is BECAUSE what they're doing is evil.
        I cant believe you are being downvoted for talking actual lore.

Im with you my man
            Because this fanbase hates the lore and likes to make up their own.
                Lmao man, I'll be honest, everyone knows the Institute justifies it themselves. The justification is all ass cause none of it makes sense. You seem to fail to realize that just because the writing gives a reason doesn't automatically make it good. 

This is why people say the writing is poor, cause sure, the Institute says they have reasons, but when you scrutinize them, you realize the reasons make no fucking sense. **You've also failed to acknowledge that the Institute's goal is to help the Commonwealth and use science to better the post war world**. 

That's something they establish to you once you become leader of the institute. So let's breakdown some of their actions and see how well does it serve the goal mentioned above. 

They made supermutants to destabilize the area so that no one would oppose them. Okay, but why exactly? The Institute themselves have stated they were focused on their research and advancing it, but they clearly don't have plans for world domination. Why do they *need* to destabilize an entire region? How does that serve their goals in research? They state they want to make a better world, one more similar to the pre-war Era, but then they create an entire faction of super mutants who then actively ruin the Commonwealth? 

Even then, how does fucking over other factions hurt them? The altruistic minute men could have been used to meet the goal of making the Commonwealth better. The Railroad wouldn't have needed to exist had they adopted a less blatantly brain dead outlook on synths. "Let's create synths who can act, feel, and be human but oh, they just aren't human to us!" The only faction that would seriously oppose them is the BoS yet the super mutants weren't a problem for them. The BoS are outsiders, they didn't have a real establishment in the Commonwealth til the event of Fallout 4. So the release of super mutants just fucked over the only factions that could have worked with them, and also just fucked over the Commonwealth incredibly. Not to mention that it makes their synths ' job of finding and salvaging significantly harder now. Like, creating super mutants was by far the dumbest thing they did cause it's like dumping a bucket of soap to clean a spill. Sure itl clean the spill, but now there's a bucket of soap you need to clean up. 

Kidnapping people is also fucking bizarre because again, it makes no sense. What's the end goal? Sure, you can argue they kidnap political figures but it's not even that. We see that they straight up kidnap random ass people too and replace them. Tell me, what purpose **that serves the Institute 'a goals** does kidnapping a random farmer do? They argue that they actually are taking valued individuals which makes even less sense. Why would you risk exposing your secret organization by taking in a bunch of randoms and then replace them? You literally had an entire vault of frozen folk, some of which were alive, and killed them. Even then, they had the ability to create sentient beings with potentially mechanical skillets. **Why would you not use the fucking intelligent robot beings to cover any logistical internal staffing?**

Again, the Institute would have been fine had they been openly more evil with their ambitions. But no, you meet them and they mostly just want to continue their research. What they *do* and what they *want* fail to align, hence why people say that the Institute is a shallow, immoral organization.
                    >You've also failed to acknowledge that the Institute's goal is to help the Commonwealth and use science to better the post war world

...no. It's not. Their entire questline involves them getting the necessary requirements to have their own power independence and thrive *underground* while they leave the surface in squalor because they see it as an irredeemable hell.

I...am not sure i want to waste my breath on the rest of your comment after this. Honestly.
                        If they plan on thriving underground, why did they destabilize the surface?
                        >...no. It's not. Their entire questline involves them getting the necessary requirements to have their own power independence and thrive underground while they leave the surface in squalor because they see it as an irredeemable hell.

Except that's not their only goal. They straight up tell you they want to "help the Commonwealth" or that the "Commonwealth will have nothing to fear," at times. This is why I said they are poorly written. Their goals are that they want to help the Commonwealth but also they want to stay isolated away from it cause they view it to be unredeemable. They think the people are savages yet they take them or experiment on them. They believe that their brand new synths can be used to replace human beings yet somehow view them as if they were still bumbling, obvious robots that can't at all be anything resembling human.

Father himself states that the Institute is trying to redefine mankind. What does that even mean if they also view their human like creations as not human whatsoever. Not to mention that Father will actually have the Institute form Public relations if you can convince him.

This is also a tendency shown by the game that the Institute fails to consolidate a single goal because they don't genuinely have a solid goal to reach. 

Even then, their goal of staying underground and being independent is still not at all aligned with their actions. Why do they want to stay away from everybody if they actively antagonize people? Why release super mutants into the area that makes things worse for everyone involved and is a super huge risk? Why not just do what needs to be done cause we actively don't see *any* benefit for the Institute in replacing people at all. Sure, they can act as spies, but **why do they need spies in the first place? They have synths who can replace humans, so why don't they just integrate them into societies rather than kidnapping people like a comic villain**? They can make their own super synths that are super human that would obviously, and so clearly be able to become incredibly well-respected in places like Diamond City yet they choose to just steal people, turn them into super mutants, and make a whole ass new synth to replace them? 

Even then, their replacements are genuinely ass considering how often people notice it.

If they want to just be left alone, why do they actively not try to do that? Had they just done everything silently, nobody would have known about anything. They have all the resources to create their own army, gorillas, and humans yet they somehow didn't opt to just, not do things the easy way? It's supposed to show that the Institute is full of a bunch of narcissists and cynics, but at the same time it just makes the Institute incredibly incompetent. If their main goal was independence, why are they actively making themselves known to the world and also choosing to piss them off rather than work with them? There's a difference between thinking the world above is unsalvageable and another to commit mass murder.

None of it makes sense because the two things we hear about what the Institute wants doesn't match their actions. They want to stay secluded and do their own thing? Then why do the actively antagonize people outside causing ire against them and thus leading to their downfall? Why do they kidnap people and experiment on them to make super mutants? Why make super mutants and actually make the job of salvaging worse by letting them take over multiple areas of the game? This is made worse considering they literally have the most secure entrance before the Sole Survivor comes in. They are virtually untouchable yet they keep acting as if they aren't and proceed to make the most absurd evil decisions that guarantee that the Commonwealth wants them dead. 

They also tell you they want to help the Commonwealth and obviously what they do doesn't at all align with that nonsense. 

So both goals that have been interpreted by the community (because again, the Institute is a walking narrative mess on heels that is forced to be comically evil yet somehow incredibly incompetent) fail to at all align with their goals. 

Also yeah, somehow hitting enter just sent the comment for whatever reason lmao.
                How would anyone unite against the institute if no one knows they exist and the only way in is a teleporter? In what way are they threatened? And before that they were at risk of what? The minute men becoming a major player, the only unambiguously good faction? Wouldn't their whole plan would have made more sense to help the minute men and then leverege the favors for power?
                    >How would anyone unite against the institute if no one knows they exist and the only way in is a teleporter? In what way are they threatened?

...the railroad and brotherhood and minutemen all fought against the institute without knowledge of their base or teleportation. The minutemen even was a force to reckon with against the institute at one point.

However, the unification doesn't have to be directly threatening. It could make it harder for the institute to replace key people. Or get parts for their projects. Etc.

>Wouldn't their whole plan would have made more sense to help the minute men and then leverege the favors for power?

Why would they help the minutemen? Who went against them in the past?
                        We are back to the circular logic problem of the institute. Everyone hates them because they were assholes and then that justifies them being assholes. If they didn't suck and stayed to true to either goal, helping the wasteland like you get told when you take over. Or two just stayed underground and worked to establish their own power grid. Neither of those goals require the super mutants, neither requires kidnapping. And as someone else said, why even make synths this smart? Just stop like one generation ago and they would have largely avoided the whole robot slavery problem but still had a free labor pool. Most of the time it seems the best explanation for why, is that it seems the writers needed it that way, and that's bad writing
                Indeed, i stopped correcting people here becuase they literally refuse actual lore with source, and rather upvote shitty theories like the player being a synth or pretend that NV is a flawless game.

    I'm not a he and you're blocked for trying to keep others from conversing with me.

Just for anyone who sees this, i am not a "rage baiter", i am not a troll. I am talking to people.
At Feb 3rd I heard news that he was leaving, but now I can't find it anymore
>But he's allowed to have his opinion about the story

Sure. But an ignorant opinion (because they refuse to pay attention) is not a valid one.

You might as well say i'm allowed my ignorant opinion on, say, shawshank redemption. Didn't pay attention to it, but i *could* say it is the worst movie to ever exist and is poorly written. How is it poorly written? Idk, i didn't pay attention. That's not how this works, though. If you refuse to pay attention, but then act like the writing **is** flawed...your claim is invalid.
    Or....he just views it differently then you.  and he didn't like explanations that maybe you did.  Or things that felt like they fit like a glove to you....felt forced to him.  that's kind of how differences of opinions work.  Hell...it's given you something to talk about this morning/eevening, so aren't differences of opinions beneficial?
        Mr. Benjamin_Starscape is being really aggressively argumentative all over the post.  Not just disagreeing with people, but calling everyone with a differing opinion "ignorant" like it's on his word of the day calendar.  And when someone offers a rebuttal to his points, he ignores the point they made to call them stupid a second time.
            I'm not a guy. And i'm not calling anyone ignorant. I'm calling their "opinions" ignorant because it shows they didn't pay attention.
                Sorry for assuming, I made an educated guess since you have a masculine screenname.  But male, female, both, or neither, you're still being *really obnoxious* on this post.
                    all i'm asking for is that people pay attention to the media they consume. if that's obnoxious, sue me.
                        You're assuming that *your* interpretations are the only correct ones, and *everyone* who came to a different conclusion than you simply didn't "pay attention."  And complaining that the fandom has gotten dumb because some people are disagreeing with you.

Do you not see how that's obnoxious?
        Ignorant opinions aren't beneficial. They only spread ignorance and make the audience dumber. This fanbase has gotten dumber. Audiences overall have gotten dumber. Gamers as a whole do not pay attention.

You shouldn't let ignorance go under "it's just an opinion". It breeds ignorance.
            You seem like the kind of guy that thinks you need an especially high IQ, such as yours, to understand the nuances of Rick and Morty.
                I'm not a guy, iq is not a good measure of intellect, and i don't find rick and morty nuanced or funny or good.

You made an awful lot of assumptions that were all wrong. If saying you should pay attention, the most basic ask for the audience, feels like you need a high iq...idk what to really tell you.

Because literally all i'm telling people is to *pay attention*.
                    It was a joke that clearly sailed a few thousand feet above your head but alright.
                        Or it just wasn't a good joke.
    You are allowed your ignorant opinion on Shawshank. You are allowed to have any opinion on anything you want. That’s the neat thing about opinions.
        >You are allowed your ignorant opinion on Shawshank

No! No, i am not. In that example i refused to pay attention and then criticized it. That is *not* okay. Criticism through ignorance is not criticism.
    grow the fuck up.
        Yes. *i'm* the one who needs to grow up.
            yes, you are. you're acting like a petulant child.
                I mean they are almost certainly 11
                ...because i don't like comments that spread misinformation due to the commenter not paying attention?
                    Bro is calling opinions misinformation lmao it's not that deep dude it's a video game
                        video games are a form of art. the same as books, movies, and paintings. saying that the game has bad writing based on nothing other than you not paying attention *is* misinformation.

it's also, again, not an opinion. it's just ignorance. plain ignorance. which would easily be fixed by the most basic of audience participation...paying attention. it's not some huge ask.
Haha yes now if only I can learn to draw people properly I'd make it into a comic
I don't think it needs to be much longer for my idea to work. Then again most of the time I end up running into those other rooms anyway so I wouldn't have trouble spending another couple seconds picking up some friends. I guess that last cutscene with them arguing could lengthen it a little but hopefully not too much.
    Have one settler ask "do you know what happened here?!"

Then pick a dialogue option:

1: Yes, follow me! We'll find our families, I promise. [Skips tutorial, you exit straight to the elevator ride]

2: I... no. We'd better look around and figure out what's going on. [You play the tutorial/ explore the vault]

I'd play this as an alternative intro mod!
        Yess
Why would they though? In an apocalypse, the Institute offers shelter, food, and modern conveniences. And they wouldn’t know anything about them being sketchy.
[Old man](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/old%20man) is also a common term for "a man in authority."
Maybe Boston just had someone actually bothering with making pipe guns which then spread all over the place.
The Institute has been shown to be uncaring and xenophobic towards to surface population. Which leads to things such as massacring whole towns/vaults, which is shown throughout our own history, “war never changes”. I wouldn’t even call it stupid/cartoonishly evil because that has happened in our own history, people who think of people as lesser will just kill them because they think they’re superior. Another one of the institutes flaws is that their arrogance blinds them and makes them do stupid things, which could also explain the vault dwellers being killed. 

And the Backup needed to have the same DNA as Shaun, IIRC that was mentioned at the end of the Battle of Bunker Hill quest
    I agree with this POV in principle - the final talk with Shaun on the building where he goes "yep civilisations is destroyed look at this" and your Sole doesn't get to bring up ANY of the world they're doing to rebuild is stupid but shows how single-minded the Institute is with regards to their own superiority...

...But it doesn't explain their ultimate goal. Like at all. Do they want to retake the surface? Remain underground forever? Well then why do they keep sabotaging the surface? Why did they make super mutants? Why are they replacing surface people with synths? What's the *point* of it all? Even if you become Director there's no real explanation of their exact end goal and it's so frustrating. At least Minutemen = rebuild Commonweath, Railroad = rescue all synths, BOS = exterminate technological threats. Institute = ??????????? uhhh cool robots. Or something.
        Yep. 'What does the Institute *want*' is the driving question of the game, and  unlike the clear and defined goals of everyone else, the Institute is this vague and hazy nebulous blob of science nerds who have spent the last two centuries peeing in everyone else's cornflakes for no clear goal or reason.

I suspect, that in much the same way the Gunners are a reskin of Talon Company, the Institute was originally going to be a reskin of the FO3 Enclave- unambiguously bad guy nazi-likes that you can mow down without guilt or remorse.

Then New Vegas came out, and people loved and still love to this day, the fact that you can support anyone and have fairly cogent arguments for all the factions, much like Daggerfall. ^(Ceaser's Legion is a bunch of losers and a dead end ideology though.)

So I imagine that Emil decided to retool the factions drastically *after* they had already started development, and that's why the Institute is so.... nebulous.
Okay, maybe it doesn't actually make *zero* sense, but I still think it was awkwardly written to preserve the twist.  I feel like if Kellogg had called them both "the Director" it would have worked better.
    I agree that would probably have worked a bit better. I think it's only really awkward because he refers to them as "the" old man but, I don't think it's really that weird I mean being nicknamed "old man" or "the kid" is not super uncommon
Well, you're the only one. It was not in any of my playthroughs and the wiki still lists it as inaccessible. You sure you're not using mods?
    I use mods, definitely, but the terminal entry in question was actually in the original game. Some derp programmer at Bethesda forgot to "turn it on" (according to YouTuber JuiceHead). This was rectified with the release of Far Harbor in 2016. If you play the game without Far Harbor, that entry will not be there.

The wiki may list it as cut content, but it was restored with Far Harbor. Kinda makes DiMA's suggestion that you could be a synth a pretty obvious hint.
        I have played the game with Far Harbor. And this youtuber can read minds apparently and know what unknown developers were thinking?
            Okay, cool then. Prove me wrong. Next time you play, check out all the terminals in Robotics at The Institute.
                I have checked all the terminals in the Institute.
                    Also checked - not there.
But why would anyone who *wasn't* Shaun's parent and Nate/Nora's grieving and enraged spouse have been a loose end?  None of the people in the vault had any reason to act against the Institute until they gave the protagonist two really good ones.

"Loose ends" is a wallpaper explanation covering up a big plot hole.
    >But why would anyone who wasn't Shaun's parent and Nate/Nora's grieving and enraged spouse have been a loose end?

They might not. But they'd just spread more rumors the institute doesn't want.

>"Loose ends" is a wallpaper explanation covering up a big plot hole.

This isn't a plot hole. This fandom needs to learn what a plot hole is. You want a plot hole? How about caesar sending you down into the bunker instead of a frumentarii whose sole job is the exception to caesar's rules?
        Caesar was recruiting the Courier, the only person who has access to the Lucky 38, and testing to see if they'll obey his orders.  With all your railing against people who "don't pay attention" on this post, I'm surprised you missed something so blatantly obvious.
            >Caesar was recruiting the Courier, the only person who has access to the Lucky 38, and testing to see if they'll obey his orders.

...except the courier needs the chip for house or themself. And so caesar stupidly just hands them over the key and says "yeah bro, you got this". If isn't a test. Because his reason when asked was "i'd have to kill them".

And then, he doesn't even check after you. He just takes a tremor as evidence.

>With all your railing against people who "don't pay attention" on this post, I'm surprised you missed something so blatantly obvious.

The irony cannot be further lost on you. You literally made up a reason. What you said isn't true at all. Because, like i said, his reason is "i'd have to kill them". The courier literally can ask "why can't you just send a legionaire", there is nothing about this being a test. And he does not go check after you. He should have sent a frumentarii, the people who are allowed to touch technology.
Yes.  The Institute was created by the survivors of the Commonwealth Institute of Technology (aka, non-copyright MIT).  They may have had some projects that were used by the US government before the war, and by extension Vault-tec, but it wasn't affiliated with the company.
    History is written by the survivors.

                The drug dealer was one of Nate's neighbors, His terminal is the one that is connected to a locked safe in Sanctuary
                    Right I just checked and even without dates, the dealer reference connections in the army, a potential cop under cover, definitly pre-war, my bad.

To stop the spread of some new strain of pre-war plague or something. Something close to origins of FEV, that was originally developed no as a "super soldier serum", but a way to stop the disease.

I believe that plague was the central part of cancelled Van Buren, if I am not mistaken.
    Yeah that was the ultimate plot.  The pc was a carrier and would infect every settlement they encountered while the bad guys chasing you were trying to quarantine the plauge.

The ending had the pc having to pick the places the cure would go while nuking the rest iirc.

I also like the setup for 76 with the scorched plague.  It's backstory is more interesting than most games main quest and it's a shame bethesda didn't go with it as 76s main story instead of cleaning up the mess
        Not exactly. Creating a cure for plague was a separate sub-plot. It was the automated and malfunctioning prison system that was trying to bring you and other prisoners back. You needed all of them back yourself to deactivate it.

Bad guy was a mad ex-NCR scientist monitoring you actions and willing to bombard the living crap outta USA.

Final decision - pick an area to sacrifice using BOMB space station (same as one if FO76's crater) as you were too late to stop the launch.

In essence, that scientist became a prototype for Father Elijah from Dead Money.

With some adjustments, Van Buren could work as a perfect New Vegas prequel, given a lot of characters!/events/locations/factions are still mentioned inNew Vegas.

As for FO76, I still wish it was a proper SP spin-off. It had a huge potential and in most aspects I still like it more than FO4.
            They used some of the Van Buren plot for Fallout 76, and some in the New Vegas Lonesome Road DLC.

The mad scientist was deliberately trying to spread the plague, since this was the only way to raise the automated 'alert' level so he could unlock the BOMB satellites.    His motivation was essentially the same as Ulysses in Lonesome Road - he wanted to wipe away the existing societies to start again from scratch.
> I feel like they just went with generic b movie scifi villains.

That's because they are, it's the only way to actually advance technology.  See my [theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/11ohbon/comment/jbtbu3m/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) above...
The institute sends super mutants to the surface to keep it destabilized. A unified surface brings in a threat to the institute (just look at the minutemen or brotherhood or railroad who are all unified factions that can take on the institute). It also allows the region to remain relatively stagnant, allowing the institute free reign of resources.

They also replace people for political reasons. Like mcdonough. Or to oversee projects. Like roger Warwick.
    Lmao, the only reason they're a threat to the institute is because the institute is killing and replacing random fuckin people. It's not exactly a chicken/egg situation.
        Yes. They're imperialists. Empires/imperialists tend to create enemies.
            No they're not, they're isolationists. They want nothing to do with the surface, by their account. So why do they keep doing things to make the surface hate them?
                Because they are the Think Tank played (somewhat) straight.  A lot of the things they do have no other purpose than to be weird, directionless science experiments.
                There are different forms of imperialism. Remember when the u.s. said they were entering an isolationist phase and still conquered islands and such?

>So why do they keep doing things to make the surface hate them?

Because they *want* to be hated. /s

They require resources. Just like every society. So they do what they can to keep those resources out of everyone's hands but theirs.
                    They're really not imperialists, Shaun literally says they want to wait for the surfacers to die out. And iirc the only outside resource they ever needed was the mass fusion generator, before that they were self sufficient. Occasionally they recruited scientists from the surface. But we never see them gathering resources.

Imo the biggest problem with the Institute's motivation is why they made the synths. They say they're working on humanity's evolution, which would imply they want synths to replace humans. But if that's true, why do they deny synth sentience and use them as slaves?
            I think people just weren't in the mood for an Ivy League Enclave.
                they're not like the enclave.
                    No? A technologically superior pre-war holdout group that is comically evil when it doesn't benefit them at all and thinks of all human life outside their small community as expendable, and wants to perpetuate the worst of the pre-war culture that caused the war in the first place. And their primary interest in the player character is due to their genetic purity. That doesn't remind you the tiniest bit of the Enclave?
    > just look at the minutemen or brotherhood or railroad who are all unified factions that can take on the institute

Because the institute are objectively evil because of their constant actions, you're saying the reason they do their evil actions is because of the consequences of their evil actions
        ...no, they do their actions because they're evil. but they do have reasons that aren't "oh we're evil". sending super mutants to the surface isn't "we're evil" it's "we don't want anyone to be able to unite against us".
            Are you trying to say that intentionally creating murderous mutants to send to terrorize people isn't evil?
                It is. But their *reasoning* is *not* "we are doing it because we are evil". They do not think they are evil. They *justify* it or have different reasons for it.
                    Dude nobody is saying the Institute doesn't self rationalize their stupid evil tendencies. People are saying they would prefer is there was actual nuance instead of stupid evil. Personally I would have preferred an Institute that has screwed up BECAUSE they are trying to help the surface without interacting with it. Would have been interesting where you spend almost the whole game expecting some Cabal of evil mad scientists just to arrive and find out they are just way out of the depth.
                    If as you say their justification is to prevent people uniting against them, then it makes zero sense, because the whole reason why factions like the minutement are uniting against them is BECAUSE what they're doing is evil.
    I cant believe you are being downvoted for talking actual lore.

Im with you my man
        Because this fanbase hates the lore and likes to make up their own.
            Lmao man, I'll be honest, everyone knows the Institute justifies it themselves. The justification is all ass cause none of it makes sense. You seem to fail to realize that just because the writing gives a reason doesn't automatically make it good. 

This is why people say the writing is poor, cause sure, the Institute says they have reasons, but when you scrutinize them, you realize the reasons make no fucking sense. **You've also failed to acknowledge that the Institute's goal is to help the Commonwealth and use science to better the post war world**. 

That's something they establish to you once you become leader of the institute. So let's breakdown some of their actions and see how well does it serve the goal mentioned above. 

They made supermutants to destabilize the area so that no one would oppose them. Okay, but why exactly? The Institute themselves have stated they were focused on their research and advancing it, but they clearly don't have plans for world domination. Why do they *need* to destabilize an entire region? How does that serve their goals in research? They state they want to make a better world, one more similar to the pre-war Era, but then they create an entire faction of super mutants who then actively ruin the Commonwealth? 

Even then, how does fucking over other factions hurt them? The altruistic minute men could have been used to meet the goal of making the Commonwealth better. The Railroad wouldn't have needed to exist had they adopted a less blatantly brain dead outlook on synths. "Let's create synths who can act, feel, and be human but oh, they just aren't human to us!" The only faction that would seriously oppose them is the BoS yet the super mutants weren't a problem for them. The BoS are outsiders, they didn't have a real establishment in the Commonwealth til the event of Fallout 4. So the release of super mutants just fucked over the only factions that could have worked with them, and also just fucked over the Commonwealth incredibly. Not to mention that it makes their synths ' job of finding and salvaging significantly harder now. Like, creating super mutants was by far the dumbest thing they did cause it's like dumping a bucket of soap to clean a spill. Sure itl clean the spill, but now there's a bucket of soap you need to clean up. 

Kidnapping people is also fucking bizarre because again, it makes no sense. What's the end goal? Sure, you can argue they kidnap political figures but it's not even that. We see that they straight up kidnap random ass people too and replace them. Tell me, what purpose **that serves the Institute 'a goals** does kidnapping a random farmer do? They argue that they actually are taking valued individuals which makes even less sense. Why would you risk exposing your secret organization by taking in a bunch of randoms and then replace them? You literally had an entire vault of frozen folk, some of which were alive, and killed them. Even then, they had the ability to create sentient beings with potentially mechanical skillets. **Why would you not use the fucking intelligent robot beings to cover any logistical internal staffing?**

Again, the Institute would have been fine had they been openly more evil with their ambitions. But no, you meet them and they mostly just want to continue their research. What they *do* and what they *want* fail to align, hence why people say that the Institute is a shallow, immoral organization.
                >You've also failed to acknowledge that the Institute's goal is to help the Commonwealth and use science to better the post war world

...no. It's not. Their entire questline involves them getting the necessary requirements to have their own power independence and thrive *underground* while they leave the surface in squalor because they see it as an irredeemable hell.

I...am not sure i want to waste my breath on the rest of your comment after this. Honestly.
                    If they plan on thriving underground, why did they destabilize the surface?
                    >...no. It's not. Their entire questline involves them getting the necessary requirements to have their own power independence and thrive underground while they leave the surface in squalor because they see it as an irredeemable hell.

Except that's not their only goal. They straight up tell you they want to "help the Commonwealth" or that the "Commonwealth will have nothing to fear," at times. This is why I said they are poorly written. Their goals are that they want to help the Commonwealth but also they want to stay isolated away from it cause they view it to be unredeemable. They think the people are savages yet they take them or experiment on them. They believe that their brand new synths can be used to replace human beings yet somehow view them as if they were still bumbling, obvious robots that can't at all be anything resembling human.

Father himself states that the Institute is trying to redefine mankind. What does that even mean if they also view their human like creations as not human whatsoever. Not to mention that Father will actually have the Institute form Public relations if you can convince him.

This is also a tendency shown by the game that the Institute fails to consolidate a single goal because they don't genuinely have a solid goal to reach. 

Even then, their goal of staying underground and being independent is still not at all aligned with their actions. Why do they want to stay away from everybody if they actively antagonize people? Why release super mutants into the area that makes things worse for everyone involved and is a super huge risk? Why not just do what needs to be done cause we actively don't see *any* benefit for the Institute in replacing people at all. Sure, they can act as spies, but **why do they need spies in the first place? They have synths who can replace humans, so why don't they just integrate them into societies rather than kidnapping people like a comic villain**? They can make their own super synths that are super human that would obviously, and so clearly be able to become incredibly well-respected in places like Diamond City yet they choose to just steal people, turn them into super mutants, and make a whole ass new synth to replace them? 

Even then, their replacements are genuinely ass considering how often people notice it.

If they want to just be left alone, why do they actively not try to do that? Had they just done everything silently, nobody would have known about anything. They have all the resources to create their own army, gorillas, and humans yet they somehow didn't opt to just, not do things the easy way? It's supposed to show that the Institute is full of a bunch of narcissists and cynics, but at the same time it just makes the Institute incredibly incompetent. If their main goal was independence, why are they actively making themselves known to the world and also choosing to piss them off rather than work with them? There's a difference between thinking the world above is unsalvageable and another to commit mass murder.

None of it makes sense because the two things we hear about what the Institute wants doesn't match their actions. They want to stay secluded and do their own thing? Then why do the actively antagonize people outside causing ire against them and thus leading to their downfall? Why do they kidnap people and experiment on them to make super mutants? Why make super mutants and actually make the job of salvaging worse by letting them take over multiple areas of the game? This is made worse considering they literally have the most secure entrance before the Sole Survivor comes in. They are virtually untouchable yet they keep acting as if they aren't and proceed to make the most absurd evil decisions that guarantee that the Commonwealth wants them dead. 

They also tell you they want to help the Commonwealth and obviously what they do doesn't at all align with that nonsense. 

So both goals that have been interpreted by the community (because again, the Institute is a walking narrative mess on heels that is forced to be comically evil yet somehow incredibly incompetent) fail to at all align with their goals. 

Also yeah, somehow hitting enter just sent the comment for whatever reason lmao.
            How would anyone unite against the institute if no one knows they exist and the only way in is a teleporter? In what way are they threatened? And before that they were at risk of what? The minute men becoming a major player, the only unambiguously good faction? Wouldn't their whole plan would have made more sense to help the minute men and then leverege the favors for power?
                >How would anyone unite against the institute if no one knows they exist and the only way in is a teleporter? In what way are they threatened?

...the railroad and brotherhood and minutemen all fought against the institute without knowledge of their base or teleportation. The minutemen even was a force to reckon with against the institute at one point.

However, the unification doesn't have to be directly threatening. It could make it harder for the institute to replace key people. Or get parts for their projects. Etc.

>Wouldn't their whole plan would have made more sense to help the minute men and then leverege the favors for power?

Why would they help the minutemen? Who went against them in the past?
                    We are back to the circular logic problem of the institute. Everyone hates them because they were assholes and then that justifies them being assholes. If they didn't suck and stayed to true to either goal, helping the wasteland like you get told when you take over. Or two just stayed underground and worked to establish their own power grid. Neither of those goals require the super mutants, neither requires kidnapping. And as someone else said, why even make synths this smart? Just stop like one generation ago and they would have largely avoided the whole robot slavery problem but still had a free labor pool. Most of the time it seems the best explanation for why, is that it seems the writers needed it that way, and that's bad writing

I'm not a he and you're blocked for trying to keep others from conversing with me.

Just for anyone who sees this, i am not a "rage baiter", i am not a troll. I am talking to people.
Or....he just views it differently then you.  and he didn't like explanations that maybe you did.  Or things that felt like they fit like a glove to you....felt forced to him.  that's kind of how differences of opinions work.  Hell...it's given you something to talk about this morning/eevening, so aren't differences of opinions beneficial?
    Mr. Benjamin_Starscape is being really aggressively argumentative all over the post.  Not just disagreeing with people, but calling everyone with a differing opinion "ignorant" like it's on his word of the day calendar.  And when someone offers a rebuttal to his points, he ignores the point they made to call them stupid a second time.
        I'm not a guy. And i'm not calling anyone ignorant. I'm calling their "opinions" ignorant because it shows they didn't pay attention.
            Sorry for assuming, I made an educated guess since you have a masculine screenname.  But male, female, both, or neither, you're still being *really obnoxious* on this post.
                all i'm asking for is that people pay attention to the media they consume. if that's obnoxious, sue me.
                    You're assuming that *your* interpretations are the only correct ones, and *everyone* who came to a different conclusion than you simply didn't "pay attention."  And complaining that the fandom has gotten dumb because some people are disagreeing with you.

Do you not see how that's obnoxious?
    Ignorant opinions aren't beneficial. They only spread ignorance and make the audience dumber. This fanbase has gotten dumber. Audiences overall have gotten dumber. Gamers as a whole do not pay attention.

You shouldn't let ignorance go under "it's just an opinion". It breeds ignorance.
        You seem like the kind of guy that thinks you need an especially high IQ, such as yours, to understand the nuances of Rick and Morty.
            I'm not a guy, iq is not a good measure of intellect, and i don't find rick and morty nuanced or funny or good.

You made an awful lot of assumptions that were all wrong. If saying you should pay attention, the most basic ask for the audience, feels like you need a high iq...idk what to really tell you.

Because literally all i'm telling people is to *pay attention*.
                It was a joke that clearly sailed a few thousand feet above your head but alright.

No! No, i am not. In that example i refused to pay attention and then criticized it. That is *not* okay. Criticism through ignorance is not criticism.

Have one settler ask "do you know what happened here?!"

Then pick a dialogue option:

1: Yes, follow me! We'll find our families, I promise. [Skips tutorial, you exit straight to the elevator ride]

2: I... no. We'd better look around and figure out what's going on. [You play the tutorial/ explore the vault]

I'd play this as an alternative intro mod!

I agree with this POV in principle - the final talk with Shaun on the building where he goes "yep civilisations is destroyed look at this" and your Sole doesn't get to bring up ANY of the world they're doing to rebuild is stupid but shows how single-minded the Institute is with regards to their own superiority...

...But it doesn't explain their ultimate goal. Like at all. Do they want to retake the surface? Remain underground forever? Well then why do they keep sabotaging the surface? Why did they make super mutants? Why are they replacing surface people with synths? What's the *point* of it all? Even if you become Director there's no real explanation of their exact end goal and it's so frustrating. At least Minutemen = rebuild Commonweath, Railroad = rescue all synths, BOS = exterminate technological threats. Institute = ??????????? uhhh cool robots. Or something.
    Yep. 'What does the Institute *want*' is the driving question of the game, and  unlike the clear and defined goals of everyone else, the Institute is this vague and hazy nebulous blob of science nerds who have spent the last two centuries peeing in everyone else's cornflakes for no clear goal or reason.

I suspect, that in much the same way the Gunners are a reskin of Talon Company, the Institute was originally going to be a reskin of the FO3 Enclave- unambiguously bad guy nazi-likes that you can mow down without guilt or remorse.

Then New Vegas came out, and people loved and still love to this day, the fact that you can support anyone and have fairly cogent arguments for all the factions, much like Daggerfall. ^(Ceaser's Legion is a bunch of losers and a dead end ideology though.)

So I imagine that Emil decided to retool the factions drastically *after* they had already started development, and that's why the Institute is so.... nebulous.
I agree that would probably have worked a bit better. I think it's only really awkward because he refers to them as "the" old man but, I don't think it's really that weird I mean being nicknamed "old man" or "the kid" is not super uncommon
I use mods, definitely, but the terminal entry in question was actually in the original game. Some derp programmer at Bethesda forgot to "turn it on" (according to YouTuber JuiceHead). This was rectified with the release of Far Harbor in 2016. If you play the game without Far Harbor, that entry will not be there.

The wiki may list it as cut content, but it was restored with Far Harbor. Kinda makes DiMA's suggestion that you could be a synth a pretty obvious hint.
    I have played the game with Far Harbor. And this youtuber can read minds apparently and know what unknown developers were thinking?
        Okay, cool then. Prove me wrong. Next time you play, check out all the terminals in Robotics at The Institute.
            I have checked all the terminals in the Institute.
                Also checked - not there.
>But why would anyone who wasn't Shaun's parent and Nate/Nora's grieving and enraged spouse have been a loose end?

They might not. But they'd just spread more rumors the institute doesn't want.

>"Loose ends" is a wallpaper explanation covering up a big plot hole.

This isn't a plot hole. This fandom needs to learn what a plot hole is. You want a plot hole? How about caesar sending you down into the bunker instead of a frumentarii whose sole job is the exception to caesar's rules?
    Caesar was recruiting the Courier, the only person who has access to the Lucky 38, and testing to see if they'll obey his orders.  With all your railing against people who "don't pay attention" on this post, I'm surprised you missed something so blatantly obvious.
        >Caesar was recruiting the Courier, the only person who has access to the Lucky 38, and testing to see if they'll obey his orders.

...except the courier needs the chip for house or themself. And so caesar stupidly just hands them over the key and says "yeah bro, you got this". If isn't a test. Because his reason when asked was "i'd have to kill them".

And then, he doesn't even check after you. He just takes a tremor as evidence.

>With all your railing against people who "don't pay attention" on this post, I'm surprised you missed something so blatantly obvious.

The irony cannot be further lost on you. You literally made up a reason. What you said isn't true at all. Because, like i said, his reason is "i'd have to kill them". The courier literally can ask "why can't you just send a legionaire", there is nothing about this being a test. And he does not go check after you. He should have sent a frumentarii, the people who are allowed to touch technology.
History is written by the survivors.

    Guy was selling to a lot of people, Probably wasn't the bomb or the radiation that killed them after the apocalypse hit
        THE COMMONWEALTH NEEDS CHEMS, WOLF!
            As someone who is on anti-dep, Yeah it does
        Correct me if I'm wrong but I seem to recall no dates on the neighboring house's computer journal entries. Maybe that drug dealer is a post war one.
            The drug dealer was one of Nate's neighbors, His terminal is the one that is connected to a locked safe in Sanctuary
                Right I just checked and even without dates, the dealer reference connections in the army, a potential cop under cover, definitly pre-war, my bad.
                Oh wow, I've never found this.
Heisenberg
Yeah. Institute probably pushed it over the edge waking Nate and Nora up
Yeah that was the ultimate plot.  The pc was a carrier and would infect every settlement they encountered while the bad guys chasing you were trying to quarantine the plauge.

The ending had the pc having to pick the places the cure would go while nuking the rest iirc.

I also like the setup for 76 with the scorched plague.  It's backstory is more interesting than most games main quest and it's a shame bethesda didn't go with it as 76s main story instead of cleaning up the mess
    Not exactly. Creating a cure for plague was a separate sub-plot. It was the automated and malfunctioning prison system that was trying to bring you and other prisoners back. You needed all of them back yourself to deactivate it.

Bad guy was a mad ex-NCR scientist monitoring you actions and willing to bombard the living crap outta USA.

Final decision - pick an area to sacrifice using BOMB space station (same as one if FO76's crater) as you were too late to stop the launch.

In essence, that scientist became a prototype for Father Elijah from Dead Money.

With some adjustments, Van Buren could work as a perfect New Vegas prequel, given a lot of characters!/events/locations/factions are still mentioned inNew Vegas.

As for FO76, I still wish it was a proper SP spin-off. It had a huge potential and in most aspects I still like it more than FO4.
        They used some of the Van Buren plot for Fallout 76, and some in the New Vegas Lonesome Road DLC.

The mad scientist was deliberately trying to spread the plague, since this was the only way to raise the automated 'alert' level so he could unlock the BOMB satellites.    His motivation was essentially the same as Ulysses in Lonesome Road - he wanted to wipe away the existing societies to start again from scratch.
Lmao, the only reason they're a threat to the institute is because the institute is killing and replacing random fuckin people. It's not exactly a chicken/egg situation.
    Yes. They're imperialists. Empires/imperialists tend to create enemies.
        No they're not, they're isolationists. They want nothing to do with the surface, by their account. So why do they keep doing things to make the surface hate them?
            Because they are the Think Tank played (somewhat) straight.  A lot of the things they do have no other purpose than to be weird, directionless science experiments.
            There are different forms of imperialism. Remember when the u.s. said they were entering an isolationist phase and still conquered islands and such?

>So why do they keep doing things to make the surface hate them?

Because they *want* to be hated. /s

They require resources. Just like every society. So they do what they can to keep those resources out of everyone's hands but theirs.
                They're really not imperialists, Shaun literally says they want to wait for the surfacers to die out. And iirc the only outside resource they ever needed was the mass fusion generator, before that they were self sufficient. Occasionally they recruited scientists from the surface. But we never see them gathering resources.

Imo the biggest problem with the Institute's motivation is why they made the synths. They say they're working on humanity's evolution, which would imply they want synths to replace humans. But if that's true, why do they deny synth sentience and use them as slaves?
        I think people just weren't in the mood for an Ivy League Enclave.
            they're not like the enclave.
                No? A technologically superior pre-war holdout group that is comically evil when it doesn't benefit them at all and thinks of all human life outside their small community as expendable, and wants to perpetuate the worst of the pre-war culture that caused the war in the first place. And their primary interest in the player character is due to their genetic purity. That doesn't remind you the tiniest bit of the Enclave?
> just look at the minutemen or brotherhood or railroad who are all unified factions that can take on the institute

Because the institute are objectively evil because of their constant actions, you're saying the reason they do their evil actions is because of the consequences of their evil actions
    ...no, they do their actions because they're evil. but they do have reasons that aren't "oh we're evil". sending super mutants to the surface isn't "we're evil" it's "we don't want anyone to be able to unite against us".
        Are you trying to say that intentionally creating murderous mutants to send to terrorize people isn't evil?
            It is. But their *reasoning* is *not* "we are doing it because we are evil". They do not think they are evil. They *justify* it or have different reasons for it.
                Dude nobody is saying the Institute doesn't self rationalize their stupid evil tendencies. People are saying they would prefer is there was actual nuance instead of stupid evil. Personally I would have preferred an Institute that has screwed up BECAUSE they are trying to help the surface without interacting with it. Would have been interesting where you spend almost the whole game expecting some Cabal of evil mad scientists just to arrive and find out they are just way out of the depth.
                If as you say their justification is to prevent people uniting against them, then it makes zero sense, because the whole reason why factions like the minutement are uniting against them is BECAUSE what they're doing is evil.
I cant believe you are being downvoted for talking actual lore.

Im with you my man
    Because this fanbase hates the lore and likes to make up their own.
        Lmao man, I'll be honest, everyone knows the Institute justifies it themselves. The justification is all ass cause none of it makes sense. You seem to fail to realize that just because the writing gives a reason doesn't automatically make it good. 

This is why people say the writing is poor, cause sure, the Institute says they have reasons, but when you scrutinize them, you realize the reasons make no fucking sense. **You've also failed to acknowledge that the Institute's goal is to help the Commonwealth and use science to better the post war world**. 

That's something they establish to you once you become leader of the institute. So let's breakdown some of their actions and see how well does it serve the goal mentioned above. 

They made supermutants to destabilize the area so that no one would oppose them. Okay, but why exactly? The Institute themselves have stated they were focused on their research and advancing it, but they clearly don't have plans for world domination. Why do they *need* to destabilize an entire region? How does that serve their goals in research? They state they want to make a better world, one more similar to the pre-war Era, but then they create an entire faction of super mutants who then actively ruin the Commonwealth? 

Even then, how does fucking over other factions hurt them? The altruistic minute men could have been used to meet the goal of making the Commonwealth better. The Railroad wouldn't have needed to exist had they adopted a less blatantly brain dead outlook on synths. "Let's create synths who can act, feel, and be human but oh, they just aren't human to us!" The only faction that would seriously oppose them is the BoS yet the super mutants weren't a problem for them. The BoS are outsiders, they didn't have a real establishment in the Commonwealth til the event of Fallout 4. So the release of super mutants just fucked over the only factions that could have worked with them, and also just fucked over the Commonwealth incredibly. Not to mention that it makes their synths ' job of finding and salvaging significantly harder now. Like, creating super mutants was by far the dumbest thing they did cause it's like dumping a bucket of soap to clean a spill. Sure itl clean the spill, but now there's a bucket of soap you need to clean up. 

Kidnapping people is also fucking bizarre because again, it makes no sense. What's the end goal? Sure, you can argue they kidnap political figures but it's not even that. We see that they straight up kidnap random ass people too and replace them. Tell me, what purpose **that serves the Institute 'a goals** does kidnapping a random farmer do? They argue that they actually are taking valued individuals which makes even less sense. Why would you risk exposing your secret organization by taking in a bunch of randoms and then replace them? You literally had an entire vault of frozen folk, some of which were alive, and killed them. Even then, they had the ability to create sentient beings with potentially mechanical skillets. **Why would you not use the fucking intelligent robot beings to cover any logistical internal staffing?**

Again, the Institute would have been fine had they been openly more evil with their ambitions. But no, you meet them and they mostly just want to continue their research. What they *do* and what they *want* fail to align, hence why people say that the Institute is a shallow, immoral organization.
            >You've also failed to acknowledge that the Institute's goal is to help the Commonwealth and use science to better the post war world

...no. It's not. Their entire questline involves them getting the necessary requirements to have their own power independence and thrive *underground* while they leave the surface in squalor because they see it as an irredeemable hell.

I...am not sure i want to waste my breath on the rest of your comment after this. Honestly.
                If they plan on thriving underground, why did they destabilize the surface?
                >...no. It's not. Their entire questline involves them getting the necessary requirements to have their own power independence and thrive underground while they leave the surface in squalor because they see it as an irredeemable hell.

Except that's not their only goal. They straight up tell you they want to "help the Commonwealth" or that the "Commonwealth will have nothing to fear," at times. This is why I said they are poorly written. Their goals are that they want to help the Commonwealth but also they want to stay isolated away from it cause they view it to be unredeemable. They think the people are savages yet they take them or experiment on them. They believe that their brand new synths can be used to replace human beings yet somehow view them as if they were still bumbling, obvious robots that can't at all be anything resembling human.

Father himself states that the Institute is trying to redefine mankind. What does that even mean if they also view their human like creations as not human whatsoever. Not to mention that Father will actually have the Institute form Public relations if you can convince him.

This is also a tendency shown by the game that the Institute fails to consolidate a single goal because they don't genuinely have a solid goal to reach. 

Even then, their goal of staying underground and being independent is still not at all aligned with their actions. Why do they want to stay away from everybody if they actively antagonize people? Why release super mutants into the area that makes things worse for everyone involved and is a super huge risk? Why not just do what needs to be done cause we actively don't see *any* benefit for the Institute in replacing people at all. Sure, they can act as spies, but **why do they need spies in the first place? They have synths who can replace humans, so why don't they just integrate them into societies rather than kidnapping people like a comic villain**? They can make their own super synths that are super human that would obviously, and so clearly be able to become incredibly well-respected in places like Diamond City yet they choose to just steal people, turn them into super mutants, and make a whole ass new synth to replace them? 

Even then, their replacements are genuinely ass considering how often people notice it.

If they want to just be left alone, why do they actively not try to do that? Had they just done everything silently, nobody would have known about anything. They have all the resources to create their own army, gorillas, and humans yet they somehow didn't opt to just, not do things the easy way? It's supposed to show that the Institute is full of a bunch of narcissists and cynics, but at the same time it just makes the Institute incredibly incompetent. If their main goal was independence, why are they actively making themselves known to the world and also choosing to piss them off rather than work with them? There's a difference between thinking the world above is unsalvageable and another to commit mass murder.

None of it makes sense because the two things we hear about what the Institute wants doesn't match their actions. They want to stay secluded and do their own thing? Then why do the actively antagonize people outside causing ire against them and thus leading to their downfall? Why do they kidnap people and experiment on them to make super mutants? Why make super mutants and actually make the job of salvaging worse by letting them take over multiple areas of the game? This is made worse considering they literally have the most secure entrance before the Sole Survivor comes in. They are virtually untouchable yet they keep acting as if they aren't and proceed to make the most absurd evil decisions that guarantee that the Commonwealth wants them dead. 

They also tell you they want to help the Commonwealth and obviously what they do doesn't at all align with that nonsense. 

So both goals that have been interpreted by the community (because again, the Institute is a walking narrative mess on heels that is forced to be comically evil yet somehow incredibly incompetent) fail to at all align with their goals.

I suspect, that in much the same way the Gunners are a reskin of Talon Company, the Institute was originally going to be a reskin of the FO3 Enclave- unambiguously bad guy nazi-likes that you can mow down without guilt or remorse.

Then New Vegas came out, and people loved and still love to this day, the fact that you can support anyone and have fairly cogent arguments for all the factions, much like Daggerfall. ^(Ceaser's Legion is a bunch of losers and a dead end ideology though.)

So I imagine that Emil decided to retool the factions drastically *after* they had already started development, and that's why the Institute is so.... nebulous.
I have played the game with Far Harbor. And this youtuber can read minds apparently and know what unknown developers were thinking?
    Okay, cool then. Prove me wrong. Next time you play, check out all the terminals in Robotics at The Institute.
        I have checked all the terminals in the Institute.
            Also checked - not there.
Caesar was recruiting the Courier, the only person who has access to the Lucky 38, and testing to see if they'll obey his orders.  With all your railing against people who "don't pay attention" on this post, I'm surprised you missed something so blatantly obvious.
    >Caesar was recruiting the Courier, the only person who has access to the Lucky 38, and testing to see if they'll obey his orders.

...except the courier needs the chip for house or themself. And so caesar stupidly just hands them over the key and says "yeah bro, you got this". If isn't a test. Because his reason when asked was "i'd have to kill them".

And then, he doesn't even check after you. He just takes a tremor as evidence.

>With all your railing against people who "don't pay attention" on this post, I'm surprised you missed something so blatantly obvious.

The irony cannot be further lost on you. You literally made up a reason. What you said isn't true at all. Because, like i said, his reason is "i'd have to kill them". The courier literally can ask "why can't you just send a legionaire", there is nothing about this being a test. And he does not go check after you. He should have sent a frumentarii, the people who are allowed to touch technology.
Guy was selling to a lot of people, Probably wasn't the bomb or the radiation that killed them after the apocalypse hit
    THE COMMONWEALTH NEEDS CHEMS, WOLF!
        As someone who is on anti-dep, Yeah it does
    Correct me if I'm wrong but I seem to recall no dates on the neighboring house's computer journal entries. Maybe that drug dealer is a post war one.
        The drug dealer was one of Nate's neighbors, His terminal is the one that is connected to a locked safe in Sanctuary
            Right I just checked and even without dates, the dealer reference connections in the army, a potential cop under cover, definitly pre-war, my bad.
            Oh wow, I've never found this.
Not exactly. Creating a cure for plague was a separate sub-plot. It was the automated and malfunctioning prison system that was trying to bring you and other prisoners back. You needed all of them back yourself to deactivate it.

Bad guy was a mad ex-NCR scientist monitoring you actions and willing to bombard the living crap outta USA.

Final decision - pick an area to sacrifice using BOMB space station (same as one if FO76's crater) as you were too late to stop the launch.

In essence, that scientist became a prototype for Father Elijah from Dead Money.

With some adjustments, Van Buren could work as a perfect New Vegas prequel, given a lot of characters!/events/locations/factions are still mentioned inNew Vegas.

As for FO76, I still wish it was a proper SP spin-off. It had a huge potential and in most aspects I still like it more than FO4.
    They used some of the Van Buren plot for Fallout 76, and some in the New Vegas Lonesome Road DLC.

The mad scientist was deliberately trying to spread the plague, since this was the only way to raise the automated 'alert' level so he could unlock the BOMB satellites.    His motivation was essentially the same as Ulysses in Lonesome Road - he wanted to wipe away the existing societies to start again from scratch.
Yes. They're imperialists. Empires/imperialists tend to create enemies.
    No they're not, they're isolationists. They want nothing to do with the surface, by their account. So why do they keep doing things to make the surface hate them?
        Because they are the Think Tank played (somewhat) straight.  A lot of the things they do have no other purpose than to be weird, directionless science experiments.
        There are different forms of imperialism. Remember when the u.s. said they were entering an isolationist phase and still conquered islands and such?

>So why do they keep doing things to make the surface hate them?

Because they *want* to be hated. /s

They require resources. Just like every society. So they do what they can to keep those resources out of everyone's hands but theirs.
            They're really not imperialists, Shaun literally says they want to wait for the surfacers to die out. And iirc the only outside resource they ever needed was the mass fusion generator, before that they were self sufficient. Occasionally they recruited scientists from the surface. But we never see them gathering resources.

Imo the biggest problem with the Institute's motivation is why they made the synths. They say they're working on humanity's evolution, which would imply they want synths to replace humans. But if that's true, why do they deny synth sentience and use them as slaves?
    I think people just weren't in the mood for an Ivy League Enclave.
        they're not like the enclave.
            No? A technologically superior pre-war holdout group that is comically evil when it doesn't benefit them at all and thinks of all human life outside their small community as expendable, and wants to perpetuate the worst of the pre-war culture that caused the war in the first place. And their primary interest in the player character is due to their genetic purity. That doesn't remind you the tiniest bit of the Enclave?
...no, they do their actions because they're evil. but they do have reasons that aren't "oh we're evil". sending super mutants to the surface isn't "we're evil" it's "we don't want anyone to be able to unite against us".
    Are you trying to say that intentionally creating murderous mutants to send to terrorize people isn't evil?
        It is. But their *reasoning* is *not* "we are doing it because we are evil". They do not think they are evil. They *justify* it or have different reasons for it.
            Dude nobody is saying the Institute doesn't self rationalize their stupid evil tendencies. People are saying they would prefer is there was actual nuance instead of stupid evil. Personally I would have preferred an Institute that has screwed up BECAUSE they are trying to help the surface without interacting with it. Would have been interesting where you spend almost the whole game expecting some Cabal of evil mad scientists just to arrive and find out they are just way out of the depth.
            If as you say their justification is to prevent people uniting against them, then it makes zero sense, because the whole reason why factions like the minutement are uniting against them is BECAUSE what they're doing is evil.
Because this fanbase hates the lore and likes to make up their own.
    Lmao man, I'll be honest, everyone knows the Institute justifies it themselves. The justification is all ass cause none of it makes sense. You seem to fail to realize that just because the writing gives a reason doesn't automatically make it good. 

This is why people say the writing is poor, cause sure, the Institute says they have reasons, but when you scrutinize them, you realize the reasons make no fucking sense. **You've also failed to acknowledge that the Institute's goal is to help the Commonwealth and use science to better the post war world**. 

That's something they establish to you once you become leader of the institute. So let's breakdown some of their actions and see how well does it serve the goal mentioned above. 

They made supermutants to destabilize the area so that no one would oppose them. Okay, but why exactly? The Institute themselves have stated they were focused on their research and advancing it, but they clearly don't have plans for world domination. Why do they *need* to destabilize an entire region? How does that serve their goals in research? They state they want to make a better world, one more similar to the pre-war Era, but then they create an entire faction of super mutants who then actively ruin the Commonwealth? 

Even then, how does fucking over other factions hurt them? The altruistic minute men could have been used to meet the goal of making the Commonwealth better. The Railroad wouldn't have needed to exist had they adopted a less blatantly brain dead outlook on synths. "Let's create synths who can act, feel, and be human but oh, they just aren't human to us!" The only faction that would seriously oppose them is the BoS yet the super mutants weren't a problem for them. The BoS are outsiders, they didn't have a real establishment in the Commonwealth til the event of Fallout 4. So the release of super mutants just fucked over the only factions that could have worked with them, and also just fucked over the Commonwealth incredibly. Not to mention that it makes their synths ' job of finding and salvaging significantly harder now. Like, creating super mutants was by far the dumbest thing they did cause it's like dumping a bucket of soap to clean a spill. Sure itl clean the spill, but now there's a bucket of soap you need to clean up. 

Kidnapping people is also fucking bizarre because again, it makes no sense. What's the end goal? Sure, you can argue they kidnap political figures but it's not even that. We see that they straight up kidnap random ass people too and replace them. Tell me, what purpose **that serves the Institute 'a goals** does kidnapping a random farmer do? They argue that they actually are taking valued individuals which makes even less sense. Why would you risk exposing your secret organization by taking in a bunch of randoms and then replace them? You literally had an entire vault of frozen folk, some of which were alive, and killed them. Even then, they had the ability to create sentient beings with potentially mechanical skillets. **Why would you not use the fucking intelligent robot beings to cover any logistical internal staffing?**

Again, the Institute would have been fine had they been openly more evil with their ambitions. But no, you meet them and they mostly just want to continue their research. What they *do* and what they *want* fail to align, hence why people say that the Institute is a shallow, immoral organization.
        >You've also failed to acknowledge that the Institute's goal is to help the Commonwealth and use science to better the post war world

...no. It's not. Their entire questline involves them getting the necessary requirements to have their own power independence and thrive *underground* while they leave the surface in squalor because they see it as an irredeemable hell.

I...am not sure i want to waste my breath on the rest of your comment after this. Honestly.
            If they plan on thriving underground, why did they destabilize the surface?
            >...no. It's not. Their entire questline involves them getting the necessary requirements to have their own power independence and thrive underground while they leave the surface in squalor because they see it as an irredeemable hell.

Except that's not their only goal. They straight up tell you they want to "help the Commonwealth" or that the "Commonwealth will have nothing to fear," at times. This is why I said they are poorly written. Their goals are that they want to help the Commonwealth but also they want to stay isolated away from it cause they view it to be unredeemable. They think the people are savages yet they take them or experiment on them. They believe that their brand new synths can be used to replace human beings yet somehow view them as if they were still bumbling, obvious robots that can't at all be anything resembling human.

Father himself states that the Institute is trying to redefine mankind. What does that even mean if they also view their human like creations as not human whatsoever. Not to mention that Father will actually have the Institute form Public relations if you can convince him.

This is also a tendency shown by the game that the Institute fails to consolidate a single goal because they don't genuinely have a solid goal to reach. 

Even then, their goal of staying underground and being independent is still not at all aligned with their actions. Why do they want to stay away from everybody if they actively antagonize people? Why release super mutants into the area that makes things worse for everyone involved and is a super huge risk? Why not just do what needs to be done cause we actively don't see *any* benefit for the Institute in replacing people at all. Sure, they can act as spies, but **why do they need spies in the first place? They have synths who can replace humans, so why don't they just integrate them into societies rather than kidnapping people like a comic villain**? They can make their own super synths that are super human that would obviously, and so clearly be able to become incredibly well-respected in places like Diamond City yet they choose to just steal people, turn them into super mutants, and make a whole ass new synth to replace them? 

Even then, their replacements are genuinely ass considering how often people notice it.

If they want to just be left alone, why do they actively not try to do that? Had they just done everything silently, nobody would have known about anything. They have all the resources to create their own army, gorillas, and humans yet they somehow didn't opt to just, not do things the easy way? It's supposed to show that the Institute is full of a bunch of narcissists and cynics, but at the same time it just makes the Institute incredibly incompetent. If their main goal was independence, why are they actively making themselves known to the world and also choosing to piss them off rather than work with them? There's a difference between thinking the world above is unsalvageable and another to commit mass murder.

None of it makes sense because the two things we hear about what the Institute wants doesn't match their actions. They want to stay secluded and do their own thing? Then why do the actively antagonize people outside causing ire against them and thus leading to their downfall? Why do they kidnap people and experiment on them to make super mutants? Why make super mutants and actually make the job of salvaging worse by letting them take over multiple areas of the game? This is made worse considering they literally have the most secure entrance before the Sole Survivor comes in. They are virtually untouchable yet they keep acting as if they aren't and proceed to make the most absurd evil decisions that guarantee that the Commonwealth wants them dead. 

They also tell you they want to help the Commonwealth and obviously what they do doesn't at all align with that nonsense. 

So both goals that have been interpreted by the community (because again, the Institute is a walking narrative mess on heels that is forced to be comically evil yet somehow incredibly incompetent) fail to at all align with their goals. 

Also yeah, somehow hitting enter just sent the comment for whatever reason lmao.
    How would anyone unite against the institute if no one knows they exist and the only way in is a teleporter? In what way are they threatened? And before that they were at risk of what? The minute men becoming a major player, the only unambiguously good faction? Wouldn't their whole plan would have made more sense to help the minute men and then leverege the favors for power?
        >How would anyone unite against the institute if no one knows they exist and the only way in is a teleporter? In what way are they threatened?

...the railroad and brotherhood and minutemen all fought against the institute without knowledge of their base or teleportation. The minutemen even was a force to reckon with against the institute at one point.

However, the unification doesn't have to be directly threatening. It could make it harder for the institute to replace key people. Or get parts for their projects. Etc.

>Wouldn't their whole plan would have made more sense to help the minute men and then leverege the favors for power?

Why would they help the minutemen? Who went against them in the past?
            We are back to the circular logic problem of the institute. Everyone hates them because they were assholes and then that justifies them being assholes. If they didn't suck and stayed to true to either goal, helping the wasteland like you get told when you take over. Or two just stayed underground and worked to establish their own power grid. Neither of those goals require the super mutants, neither requires kidnapping. And as someone else said, why even make synths this smart? Just stop like one generation ago and they would have largely avoided the whole robot slavery problem but still had a free labor pool. Most of the time it seems the best explanation for why, is that it seems the writers needed it that way, and that's bad writing
    Indeed, i stopped correcting people here becuase they literally refuse actual lore with source, and rather upvote shitty theories like the player being a synth or pretend that NV is a flawless game.
I'm not a guy. And i'm not calling anyone ignorant. I'm calling their "opinions" ignorant because it shows they didn't pay attention.
    Sorry for assuming, I made an educated guess since you have a masculine screenname.  But male, female, both, or neither, you're still being *really obnoxious* on this post.
        all i'm asking for is that people pay attention to the media they consume. if that's obnoxious, sue me.
            You're assuming that *your* interpretations are the only correct ones, and *everyone* who came to a different conclusion than you simply didn't "pay attention."  And complaining that the fandom has gotten dumb because some people are disagreeing with you.

Do you not see how that's obnoxious?
You seem like the kind of guy that thinks you need an especially high IQ, such as yours, to understand the nuances of Rick and Morty.
    I'm not a guy, iq is not a good measure of intellect, and i don't find rick and morty nuanced or funny or good.

You made an awful lot of assumptions that were all wrong. If saying you should pay attention, the most basic ask for the audience, feels like you need a high iq...idk what to really tell you.

Because literally all i'm telling people is to *pay attention*.
        It was a joke that clearly sailed a few thousand feet above your head but alright.
            Or it just wasn't a good joke.
yes, you are. you're acting like a petulant child.
    I mean they are almost certainly 11
    ...because i don't like comments that spread misinformation due to the commenter not paying attention?
        Bro is calling opinions misinformation lmao it's not that deep dude it's a video game
            video games are a form of art. the same as books, movies, and paintings. saying that the game has bad writing based on nothing other than you not paying attention *is* misinformation.

it's also, again, not an opinion. it's just ignorance. plain ignorance. which would easily be fixed by the most basic of audience participation...paying attention. it's not some huge ask.
Okay, cool then. Prove me wrong. Next time you play, check out all the terminals in Robotics at The Institute.

Neither of those goals require the super mutants, neither requires kidnapping. And as someone else said, why even make synths this smart? Just stop like one generation ago and they would have largely avoided the whole robot slavery problem but still had a free labor pool. Most of the time it seems the best explanation for why, is that it seems the writers needed it that way, and that's bad writing
Indeed, i stopped correcting people here becuase they literally refuse actual lore with source, and rather upvote shitty theories like the player being a synth or pretend that NV is a flawless game.
Sorry for assuming, I made an educated guess since you have a masculine screenname.  But male, female, both, or neither, you're still being *really obnoxious* on this post.
    all i'm asking for is that people pay attention to the media they consume. if that's obnoxious, sue me.
        You're assuming that *your* interpretations are the only correct ones, and *everyone* who came to a different conclusion than you simply didn't "pay attention."  And complaining that the fandom has gotten dumb because some people are disagreeing with you.

Do you not see how that's obnoxious?
I'm not a guy, iq is not a good measure of intellect, and i don't find rick and morty nuanced or funny or good.

You made an awful lot of assumptions that were all wrong. If saying you should pay attention, the most basic ask for the audience, feels like you need a high iq...idk what to really tell you.

Because literally all i'm telling people is to *pay attention*.
    It was a joke that clearly sailed a few thousand feet above your head but alright.
        Or it just wasn't a good joke.
I mean they are almost certainly 11
...because i don't like comments that spread misinformation due to the commenter not paying attention?
    Bro is calling opinions misinformation lmao it's not that deep dude it's a video game
        video games are a form of art. the same as books, movies, and paintings. saying that the game has bad writing based on nothing other than you not paying attention *is* misinformation.

it's also, again, not an opinion. it's just ignorance. plain ignorance. which would easily be fixed by the most basic of audience participation...paying attention. it's not some huge ask.
I have checked all the terminals in the Institute.
    Also checked - not there.
As someone who is on anti-dep, Yeah it does
The drug dealer was one of Nate's neighbors, His terminal is the one that is connected to a locked safe in Sanctuary
    Right I just checked and even without dates, the dealer reference connections in the army, a potential cop under cover, definitly pre-war, my bad.
    Oh wow, I've never found this.
Because they are the Think Tank played (somewhat) straight.  A lot of the things they do have no other purpose than to be weird, directionless science experiments.
There are different forms of imperialism. Remember when the u.s. said they were entering an isolationist phase and still conquered islands and such?

>So why do they keep doing things to make the surface hate them?

Because they *want* to be hated. /s

They require resources. Just like every society. So they do what they can to keep those resources out of everyone's hands but theirs.
    They're really not imperialists, Shaun literally says they want to wait for the surfacers to die out. And iirc the only outside resource they ever needed was the mass fusion generator, before that they were self sufficient. Occasionally they recruited scientists from the surface. But we never see them gathering resources.

Imo the biggest problem with the Institute's motivation is why they made the synths. They say they're working on humanity's evolution, which would imply they want synths to replace humans. But if that's true, why do they deny synth sentience and use them as slaves?
they're not like the enclave.
    No? A technologically superior pre-war holdout group that is comically evil when it doesn't benefit them at all and thinks of all human life outside their small community as expendable, and wants to perpetuate the worst of the pre-war culture that caused the war in the first place. And their primary interest in the player character is due to their genetic purity. That doesn't remind you the tiniest bit of the Enclave?
It is. But their *reasoning* is *not* "we are doing it because we are evil". They do not think they are evil. They *justify* it or have different reasons for it.
    Dude nobody is saying the Institute doesn't self rationalize their stupid evil tendencies. People are saying they would prefer is there was actual nuance instead of stupid evil. Personally I would have preferred an Institute that has screwed up BECAUSE they are trying to help the surface without interacting with it. Would have been interesting where you spend almost the whole game expecting some Cabal of evil mad scientists just to arrive and find out they are just way out of the depth.
    If as you say their justification is to prevent people uniting against them, then it makes zero sense, because the whole reason why factions like the minutement are uniting against them is BECAUSE what they're doing is evil.
>You've also failed to acknowledge that the Institute's goal is to help the Commonwealth and use science to better the post war world

...no. It's not. Their entire questline involves them getting the necessary requirements to have their own power independence and thrive *underground* while they leave the surface in squalor because they see it as an irredeemable hell.

I...am not sure i want to waste my breath on the rest of your comment after this. Honestly.
    If they plan on thriving underground, why did they destabilize the surface?
    >...no. It's not. Their entire questline involves them getting the necessary requirements to have their own power independence and thrive underground while they leave the surface in squalor because they see it as an irredeemable hell.

Except that's not their only goal. They straight up tell you they want to "help the Commonwealth" or that the "Commonwealth will have nothing to fear," at times. This is why I said they are poorly written. Their goals are that they want to help the Commonwealth but also they want to stay isolated away from it cause they view it to be unredeemable. They think the people are savages yet they take them or experiment on them. They believe that their brand new synths can be used to replace human beings yet somehow view them as if they were still bumbling, obvious robots that can't at all be anything resembling human.

Father himself states that the Institute is trying to redefine mankind. What does that even mean if they also view their human like creations as not human whatsoever. Not to mention that Father will actually have the Institute form Public relations if you can convince him.

This is also a tendency shown by the game that the Institute fails to consolidate a single goal because they don't genuinely have a solid goal to reach. 

Even then, their goal of staying underground and being independent is still not at all aligned with their actions. Why do they want to stay away from everybody if they actively antagonize people? Why release super mutants into the area that makes things worse for everyone involved and is a super huge risk? Why not just do what needs to be done cause we actively don't see *any* benefit for the Institute in replacing people at all. Sure, they can act as spies, but **why do they need spies in the first place? They have synths who can replace humans, so why don't they just integrate them into societies rather than kidnapping people like a comic villain**? They can make their own super synths that are super human that would obviously, and so clearly be able to become incredibly well-respected in places like Diamond City yet they choose to just steal people, turn them into super mutants, and make a whole ass new synth to replace them? 

Even then, their replacements are genuinely ass considering how often people notice it.

If they want to just be left alone, why do they actively not try to do that? Had they just done everything silently, nobody would have known about anything. They have all the resources to create their own army, gorillas, and humans yet they somehow didn't opt to just, not do things the easy way? It's supposed to show that the Institute is full of a bunch of narcissists and cynics, but at the same time it just makes the Institute incredibly incompetent. If their main goal was independence, why are they actively making themselves known to the world and also choosing to piss them off rather than work with them? There's a difference between thinking the world above is unsalvageable and another to commit mass murder.

None of it makes sense because the two things we hear about what the Institute wants doesn't match their actions. They want to stay secluded and do their own thing? Then why do the actively antagonize people outside causing ire against them and thus leading to their downfall? Why do they kidnap people and experiment on them to make super mutants? Why make super mutants and actually make the job of salvaging worse by letting them take over multiple areas of the game? This is made worse considering they literally have the most secure entrance before the Sole Survivor comes in. They are virtually untouchable yet they keep acting as if they aren't and proceed to make the most absurd evil decisions that guarantee that the Commonwealth wants them dead. 

They also tell you they want to help the Commonwealth and obviously what they do doesn't at all align with that nonsense. 

So both goals that have been interpreted by the community (because again, the Institute is a walking narrative mess on heels that is forced to be comically evil yet somehow incredibly incompetent) fail to at all align with their goals. 

Also yeah, somehow hitting enter just sent the comment for whatever reason lmao.
>How would anyone unite against the institute if no one knows they exist and the only way in is a teleporter? In what way are they threatened?

...the railroad and brotherhood and minutemen all fought against the institute without knowledge of their base or teleportation. The minutemen even was a force to reckon with against the institute at one point.

However, the unification doesn't have to be directly threatening. It could make it harder for the institute to replace key people. Or get parts for their projects. Etc.

>Wouldn't their whole plan would have made more sense to help the minute men and then leverege the favors for power?

Why would they help the minutemen? Who went against them in the past?
