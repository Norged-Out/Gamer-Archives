[[I don’t remember Fallout 4 being this fucking amazing]]


I recently did another new Vegas run for like the 10th time and thought I’d give fallout 4 a try again. Last time I played it was when it initially released way back in 2016 and I did a full play through followed by another one to get all the trophies.

But just wow. Fallout 4 is so fucking amazing. I mean the world is so overwhelmingly detailed that it’s hard to decide where to go and you get side tracked so easily, especially when you go trekking anywhere east of diamond city. The level of detail just blows my mind. I try to go 50 metres down the road but at almost every building there is something that distracts me and before you know it you start exploring the building. It seems like there is something to do and discover at every street corner. The level of detail is just overwhelming and the quests, they just never stop. I completely forgot that fallout 4 was just this great, I remember it being above average.

New Vegas is my favourite fallout game but dare I say it, is fallout 4 my new favourite fallout game?

Fuck it. Fallout 4 is the best fallout game.


Whatever else people want to say about it, exploration is one thing Fallout 4 knocked out of the park.
    That's what makes is one of THE BEST VR GAMES! I just lose myself in buildings, rubble, backwoods, etc...

It takes mods to get "hands" which aren't the best, but with those and the level of immersion in the world building, it's the best open world game made for VR so far. 

YMMV but Fallout 4 VR essentials installed from here is a great way to experience Fallout 4 with a VR headset. [https://www.wabbajack.org/](https://www.wabbajack.org/)
        Since you mentioned mods.

You can transfer saves from the VR game and non VR game.

You can mod the DLC into VR. Which literally makes the game fucking epic in VR.
        SkyrimVR is the best open world VR game!
            Have you tried Morrowind VR? It's quite good as well. 

I go between FO4VR, SkyrimVR and OpenMWVR basically as I sold my soul to Bethesda recently it appears...
                Same here. Cannot wait for SkyOblivion to launch so I can play Oblivion in SkyrimVR with all the VR enhancement mods.
                    There was some talk about SkyWind a few years ago, but I wasn't good enough at English to comprehend completely what was being said.

 Now you mention Skyblivion, may I ask you if you know something about it?
                        Basically the same thing as Skywind, Oblivion rebuilt on Skyrim's engine.
                            Thats awesome ill actually be able yo play morrowind now. I couldn’t get over the awful combat.
        As much shit as Fallout VR got at launch, I have to second this and say it is my favorite VR experience I have had to date. I've played 20 hours and barely made it through 3 quests because I keep getting sidetracked exploring.

Also in VR, Fallout really makes you want to take it slow. I almost never use my run or even walk full speed outside of combat. It just feels so much better and more immersive to walk at a realistic pace, which makes everything take loads more time but I'm okay with that because I am just so happy to feel like I am in that world.
        I think fallout 4 VR would make me a very happy man but I can't justify that cost.
            I'm right there with you, bud. Oh well, guess I'd better go buy a lotto ticket.
            Yeah don’t spend the money unless there’s other vr games you wanna play
    Wandering the wastes and trying to survive its a ton of fun.
        Survival fallout 4 improves the game 10×
            Really like the immersion of survival. Aside from the occasional death being so very much more frustrating
    As someone who disliked more than they liked about Fallout 4, you'll get almost no argument from me. After I realized it was just Goodneighbor, the Hill, and Diamond City for populated areas, it took some of the thrill out of exploring. I like exploring for the cool and hidden interactions you can find, not just as going around looting and shooting. That said, the actual world itself and all the locations clearly had a ton of love put into them. 

Also, while it's not the base game, I'd agree that Far Harbor had great exploration with absolutely 0 caveats.
        Yeah the big thing holding me back from loving Fo4 is lack of towns and questlines, so many places are just shooting galleries with a terminal to read. The best mod I have played is Tales from the Commonwealth by the guy that did Interesting NPCs for Skyrim, because it adds more quests and human interactions to some of these places that had no real point. Also adds some great new followers. I highly recommend Audrey the ghoul in the Third Rail.
            My favourite follower from Tales from the Commonwealth is Birdie! I love all the hilarious lines he has as commentary during the main story quests.
                He is great too. He was the first one I found, and we traveled together for a long time before I decided to look up where to find the others.
            I’m not sure if Bethesda for Fallout 4 tried their best with the writing, and it’s the best they can do, or if they didn’t try much at all. I’m not sure which would be worse.

I just wish they went in on either choice. Either get rid of traditional NPCs and make a more survival exploration focused game with significant additions to the gameplay, or make a game with a story that’s not garbage. Fallout 76 is the former, but without any of the additions.
                Mostly I think they ended up with quantity over quality in terms of content.  255 distinct quests, with a bunch of those repeatable/radiant. 17 permanent companions (if you count dogmeat and the random robots you can build).  Four main quest factions with distinct and overlapping quest lines.  It's... A lot.
        Same! What I would have done differently, take the settlement locations and build 75% of them into functional towns with at least one named settler that acts as a leader... then split them up between all factions 

And create a civil war type quest line of claiming all the settlements for one faction.. but allowing you to do so through, combat, dialogue, sabotage, alliances, betrayal, etc.
            This along with some of the sim settlement features built  in would have been great. 

Also a proper raider faction from the beginning. When you first go to Bunker Hill you can claim to be a raider, and your character yells it in a very aggro way, making me think at one point you actually could be a raider during development.
                Nuka World is a thing, so I wouldn't be surprised if they had that storyline in progress, couldn't finish it in time so cut it. Then, they simply did their raider thing for Nuka World.
                Yeah with all the cut content it sure does sound like they wanted to let you go raider
            That would’ve been great. But Bethesda is lazy and stupid. I’ve been playing fallout 4 for several years now and not once have I managed to build in all of the settlement locations. Hell after a certain amount it becomes pointless. You end up having to help a settlement while you’re still building. I rarely go the Minuteman route anyway. The building aspect is fun but they overdid it. They should’ve at least added a couple more towns with some named people in them. They could’ve added towns to act as Railroad safehavens, they could’ve even added a few more small towns to walk through. In fallout NV every town had ppl in it. Not this one tho
                That’s right. The established settlements are barren, and have zero dimensional settlers that give you radiant quests.. it’s too empty
                    Seriously, though. Would it really have been so difficult for them to add in some unique NPCs and questlines for each settlement? I'm sure there are mods that do it, so that's something... but it easily could have been done in the base game.
                    Yeah they literally have the player building the entire world just so they didn’t have to actually put cities into the game. They should’ve put a different engine in it. This game probably couldn’t even support another city added. Simply walking around in town makes your screen go stupid

        I was working on a Sunshine Tidings settlement, and paused mid-build because the weather in-game was clear and I had a gorgeous view where I could make out the Corvega plant and the skyline of downtown Boston.

This game can be ridiculously good-looking at the right moments.
            Especially if you add mods that make the lighting more realistic and add stars in the sky. I have a mod that makes the environment as dark at night as irl and also a mod that replaces the bland sky that with a more impressive night sky with many stars. Because after 200 years of no vehicles or many factories being used the sky should have a lot more stars than just a few specks.
    When you start modding, the game is a new game every time you try a new mod set. It just keeps giving. All hail modders!
    I feel like that's something even the most staunch critics of the game would agree to(I consider myself one of them). Exploration is the primary way of interacting with this game.
    Yeah yesterday I just decided to walk around doing nothing and it was super fun. Even if I found a location I already knew about from a previous save it still felt super fun just walking up on it.
     But that story bro. I agree with the vastness and the exploration but man o man, the storyline was absolutely embarrassing, and the dialogue options? Dont get me started. But Im an optimist. Let's hope whoever does fallout 5 understands what we yearn for. I want the scary, dismal, depressing, story with terrifying new monsters.... I want the factions, like a choose your own adventure book that goes into incredible detail depending on who you side with which comes complete with hundreds of ending options. I want to build better bases, with hundreds of craftable items, and a storyline sperate from the main one when it comes to base building. I want it all. Fallout has the potential to be one of the greats of all time.
        I can still remember the excitement of not knowing wtf the institute was but hearing constant references to it, then travelling there myself..  that shit was thrilling. Having no idea what to expect and then being transported there and meeting Father..  I don't play fallout 4 for the plot but that was an aspect loved.
    I think they took the lessons learned from New Vegas seriously as well.  Companions in FO3 were a joke.  They were just there to bullet sponge and thats about it.  There is little to no depth to them.  Yeah, Fawkes has some touching moments, and who doesn't love to hear him go **YYEEERRRRR HA HA THERE YOU ARE**, but other than that?  Meh.

Companions in Vegas though?  Oh my goodness,  yeah some are more meta than others, but the stories to all of them are intense and really draw you in.  From Veronica and her deep conflicts on what to do about her family, to Boone and his torn heart, to Arcade and his family ties?  Holy smokes, there is so much to process with them.

FO4 really tried hard to copy that Vegas feel with your followers.  It isn't exactly as good as what they did in Vegas, but they did a great job regardless.  The added depth compared to FO3 I really appreciate.
        "Yeah they didn't do that good, but don't worry Bethesda we can't expect to be on the level of a studio that's been on the brink of bankruptcy its whole life."
    It seems nice until you realise that 80% of locations have nothing but a holotape or computer log, generic leveled enemies and generic loot in a steamer chest at the end.
        Literally just about every single location you stumble across has something of interest for you to find. And not just basic obvious things, you are genuinely rewarded so much more for looking in nooks and crannies compared to almost any other game including the prior BGS titles.

Beyond generic loot and junk (actually useful for settlement building and weapon modding) the are countless areas that offer world building or lore good old fashioned easter eggs through prop displays. Like Skeletons in precarious situations both funny and sad, teddy bear or gnome displays, makeshift campsites or even settlements that you can poke around and learn about what happened there, references to pop culture or other games etc. etc. And that isn't even touching on actual collectables like Bobbleheads, magazines, figurines etc. Hell even the holotapes and logs you are poopooing are genuinely great sources of lore, world building, or just basic context about the area where you found them and can lead to further things to explore.
        Lol downvoted for talking shit on a boring game, the state of this subreddit.
    Yep, fallout 4 is a great open world but horrible fallout game. It’s writing is so ass but it does have great open world elements
    Explore, combat, loot. It’s the only thing the game does well, but goddam it’s done REALLY well.
    It nearly perfected the Bethesda Loop.

Explore to find resources ->

Full up on resources and return home to craft ->

Craft more and better equipment to explore new areas ->

Repeat

The story and writing is *impressively* bad, but if you just treat the main quest as a series of progress gates for the exploration and crafting, then everything falls into place to give you a supremely entertaining exploration, combat, building, and modding sandbox.
    I only touched the main story when I was gated from exploration, so after 50 hours of fucking around, I finally finished the main story. Too bad it wasn't like FO3 where I skipped 70% of the story quests by just finding my dad, but loved to explore and loot everything!
    Disagree. FO3 and NV were much better for random exploration.
        FO3, fair play. But NV? It's an empty desert mate, and feels like it.
I dunno why people tend to throw immense amounts of shit to others for what they like, I always keep FO4 and NV all the time on my pc and fire them up occasionally. They are both great games on their own perspectives.
    To clarify, saying “think this game sucks” isn’t the same thing as shitting on a person for what they like.

The shit almost always starts because some really insecure fan gets offended that buttlicker39 says “Mass Effect 2 Sucks”

Love what you love. But remember that not everyone else will love it too.
        Agreed. 👍
            My favorite reddit interaction so far was when I said something like "I don't like the new star wars movies but I have nothing against people who do" and then immediately got downvoted and called toxic.
                Good for you. They’re just butthurt that a shit ton of people hated the sequels and they’d rather blame it on toxicity instead of the issues in the movie
        Ok but I will actually fight someone in a parking lot if they say Mass Effect 2 sucks
            I don't know about "sucks" but I'd say it's easily the weakest of the three. It massively scaled back nearly every mechanic compared to one - armor, weapons, weapon mods, abilities, etc. The only thing it really improved mechanically speaking is the shooting and cover systems. I never understood why it didn't get more flak for that especially when you consider that the follow up to Biowares other big RPG Dragon Age II did basically the same thing and people won't shut up about it.
                Well Mass Effect 2’s gameplay had something DA:II’s didn’t: it was actually fun. And while I love a good looter shooter, Mass Effect 1 was not one of them. I found the loot to become repetitive and boring about half way through the game. Everything felt like a slightly different version of what you had before. (I do love Mass Effect 1 though. The loot just isn’t one of the reasons I love it). 

As far as story/characters/world goes, Mass Effect 2 is  the best one by a mile imo. I love collecting this team of different, powerful people, getting to know them, and having it pay off (or not) in the final mission. And they kept all of the characters from ME:1 in in some way, so I didn’t miss any of them. ME:3 has the worst new characters imo, and I was never a huge fan of either Kaiden or Ashley. 

All in all I think they’re all great games though. Mass Effect 2 was just the one that hit me the hardest when I first played through them all in like 2013.
                    I thought DA2 was plenty fun, just in a different way. More of an action game than a strategy one. I do agree with the loot complaint for ME1 - I think ME3 really struck the best balance between complexity and fun. I just never hear anyone mention just how dumbed down 2 is which is so weird to me.

The story was....eh. On a micro scale (quests and characters) it was fantastic, but the macro story was also really scaled down. You went from saving the Galaxy to just kinda trying to save a few colonies. The threat was scaled down from Galaxy ending reapers to these weird enigmatic bug dudes. The plot in general was literally just go get people until something happens. It just wasn't nearly as engaging or interesting overall, even if the individual stories and characters were great. That's another issue I've heard brought up with DA2 that never seems to be a problem with ME2 - people were constantly complaining about how scaled down the plot stakes were. I mean, don't get me wrong, I do like 2 but I always find myself just really wanting to hurry up and get to 3 when I play it. Even if the story is stronger in some ways, the gameplay is just so much more scaled back and disappointing.
            Mass Effect 2 sucks
                Aiight I’m outside Denny’s where ya at?!?
        Gonna start a new account as “Buttlicker39”
            Go with my blessing
        > To clarify, saying “think this game sucks” isn’t the same thing as shitting on a person for what they like.

Exactly.  I mean, even though I've written pages-long dissertations on FO4's many, _many_ failings, I still played the thing for hundreds of hours and made almost as many mods for it as I did for _Fallout New Vegas._  (Although the majority of them were of the failing-corrective nature.)
        Well for those who don’t love it... no one is inviting you to share those opinions in a thread that is praising the thing you don’t like. It’s just as easy to keep your mouth shut.
            This is true, though one exception is called “Constructive Criticism”. If you're going to criticize something, then say why instead of just “This is poo-poo”.
                I hear what you’re saying but you can’t critique someone’s opinion. A critique occurs when a creator invites an audience to discuss their feelings regarding a thing the creator is presenting. Then the creator listens and takes it and says thanks. No debate. No differing opinions. Just a critique. This thread is not that. 

This thread is a celebration of a thing. An opinion someone has. Which one could be critical of but why? Why walk up to a group who is drinking beer just to say “I don’t like beer. I prefer wine.” What’s the point? To share how you feel? Why? 

My point is: If the OP or anyone who holds the game in high regard is expected to have enough self respect to not care when someone else dislikes the game then those who dislike it should also have enough self respect to not care when they see someone enjoying it.
                    I 100% agree. Though this is something that can't be stopped. People will do it anyway.
                    >	This thread is a celebration of a thing. An opinion someone has. Which one could be critical of but why? Why walk up to a group who is drinking beer just to say “I don’t like beer. I prefer wine.” What’s the point? To share how you feel? Why?

Sure in that situation it’s weird. But this isn’t a private conversation. **It’s a public forum** where anyone following the rules may participate in any discussion they wish. 

If you don’t want people to disagree with you then why did you come to the place specifically for discussion? 

If you want a place specifically for celebration then start a sub and ban anyone critical of the games. 

Anyone who comes to a public forum and thinks people with a different opinion should keep them to themselves is a hypocrite.
    The first 10 hours of fallout 4 are perfect.
        That is true, just pure science fiction goodness..
        Only the first ten? If the first ten are perfect then the rest is too.
            At hour eleven he got to The Railroad and realized that something was not well in The Commonwealth.
                I will defend my honor as the best railroad heavy in the commonwealth good sir. ;) not everyone likes them thats okay. I came from the ballistic weave and stayed for the people.
                    I really wish Glory could have been the railroad companion.
                    I don’t have any sort of problem with the railroad as an entity; I sided with them too. The problem I have with the railroad is the same problem I have with *all* the factions in the game: they are terribly written. I think they’re all pretty equally bad though, and the only reason I pick on the railroad is that it’s maybe the earliest that you can realize just how horrendously stupid the story is.
                        The writing was really my main gripe with F4. OP has some solid ground here imo, it is a fantastic game with hours upon hours of gameplay to offer to even the most picky of players. 

But I have a powerful bias for great writing, dialogue, and story-telling, and that’s F4s worst components. Also I wish they woulda done more with the coast and underwater aspects of the game, was really hoping we had some giant sea monsters of some kind, besides giant mirelurks,.
                            If you look at one of my other comments, you’ll see me defending the game overall. What Fo4 does well, it does *exceptionally* well; unfortunately, what it does poorly, it does exceptionally so as well. I happen to weight the qualities of a game in a way that’s favorable to Fo4, but I think all but the most disinterested players would be turned off by some of the weapons-grade bullshit that passes as plot in that game.
                Nah at 10 hours 1 second he talked to Preston again and got a settlement is asking for help
            They kind of lost the storyline directions after that point. The game is fun to play but its just not a good rpg. Great action fps tho.
                Shut up
            [deleted]
                Some fragile fans on the loose in here :D
    Best of both worlds. I do the same with Battlefield 1 and 4.
    They participated in a witch hunt when it first came out, mostly initiated by people who didn't even played Fallout before butbsuddenly were the biggest fans and had something to say about a franchise the didn't care about 10 minutes ago, and now they have to justify what they said. 

Things like "oh, yes, it's a good game, just not a good Fallout game" why? Because you don't want to die everytime a battle starts? Because it actually looks good? Because it's about saving a child and you don't care because you don't have children, so you can empathize with a super mutant that gone mad for being invisible too much but not with a mother or father looking for his child? Because the game offer you the option to build and you don't like it so now everything's bad? Or are the requisites to be a Fallout game written in a Bible only you have and Fo4 doesn't match them? 

It's the biggest, alivest, most beautiful, most repayable and most enjoyable Fallout game. It doesn't have the best main story IMO but it doesn't need it to be a good Fallout game. 

Sorry for the english, but if you didn't know Bethesda don't only translate the texts, they redo the voices in other languages too. It's a very big game and they still did it, that's very nice.
Gun play and sprinting really elevates this game above its predecessors (although I thoroughly enjoyed F4’s story over F3, but FNV still the goat in that department). It’s hard for me to go back to those games for that reason alone. Oh and the settlement building element
    I actually kind of wish there had been no main story in Fallout 4 - I know, I know, before I get banned and tarred and feathered, hear me out! The basic core of the game, a vault of frozen prewar people trying to survive would have been awesome in and of itself. 

So, the reactor starts to fail, the people get woken up by fail safes. You all converge: "What's going on?! Oh no!" You get elected leader - either due to your military background or diplomatic/lawyer background. There are a lot of stories to be told in the local community - such as the drug lord who can become a potential bad guy. Anyway, everyone goes to the bunk room where they wait for you to "find out what is happening." You go secure Sanctuary Hills, and now have to make a decision - who will you ally with? Raiders, representing a chaotic evil kind of path? The Institute, as a neutral evil kind of path? The Minute Men as a good path? The Rail Road, as a neutral kind of path? The BOS, kind of neutral/kind of evil? No one? 

The game focuses on the settlement building as a story telling mechanism for the wasteland. The story is: "You lead a group of prewar survivors. It's 200 years later. You have Codsworth to fill you in. But how do you survive? How do you rebuild?
        I'd play that.
            So did a lot of people, it was called Fallout 76, just with less narrative.
                Why would you say something so controversial yet so brave?
                I was going to say that. Lol. But seriously, for all it's early faults, 76 does feel like Fallout now, sometimes more than FO4.
            Same
        Iirc there's a mod that does something like that. It basically overhauls the entire game.
            Any idea what it’s called
                I think they're talking about the Conquerer expansion for Sim Settlements.
                Horizon!
        You know what I'd be happy with no main quests in all of the fallout tgames. Just add more interesting side quests in their place and I'd prefer that
            This is actually a really good idea. Fallouts main quests are hit or miss. It's the side quests where the game really shines. It fits the world, too. You come out from under a rock to a broken world and have to carve out your own little slice.
                I remember a mod for fallout 3 that "removed" the main quest and spawned you somewhere random.
                Agreed, and this is pretty much the case with most Bethesda RPGs. I would gladly sacrifice Skyrim and Oblivion's main questline for more side quests, too.
                    I'm going to have to seriously disagree with removing main quests from TES. Those are usually big events that put the fate of the world on the line.

Edit: Skyrim wouldn't be the same without dragons, or Oblivion without deadra.
                        Oh, I hear you. What I'm really saying is that imo, the main questline of most Bethesda RPGs post-Morrowind have been so-so from a gameplay perspective and from a story perspective. I don't think they're terrible or anything, but I think the side quests outshine them in a big way (and in a way that makes me feel more like a resident of the world than a convenient player-god). So that's what I mean when I say I'd trade those main quests for more side quests. I'm just saying, "I'll take less of that and more of that."
                    Oblivion's main quest is honestly my favourite questline in Oblivion. TES Main Quests are a vital part of the games in my opinion, while in Fallout they aren't as important.
                        Yeah, definitely will have to agree to disagree on that one, then. I liked the ending to Oblivion's main quest, but not much else. The side quests on the other hand, were much better, in my opinion. The Thieves Guild, the Dark Brotherhood, etc.
        back when i was in like, 7th grade, my friends and i would usually spend most of class just fucking around with our school google accounts writing stories and shit instead of actually paying attention in class. when fallout 4 came out, me and a lot of my friends got into the fallout series because of it and it ended up fueling two google docs named "fallout 4 2" and "fallout new vegas 2" that were just comprised of us laying into both games at the same time with bulletpoint lists joking about what each game would be like if they had the game design of the other.

this was the very first bulletpoint in "fallout 4 2";

>Rather than the main story starting with a compelling reason to follow the main story, it starts with you coming to the commonwealth via speedboat. One of the other passengers is kellogg, who then punches you in the face and steals your prized sack of 1,000 caps. Getting your caps back and getting revenge on the man who punched you is your only motive for setting a mass war into motion.

6 years later, i think i honestly would be fully down for a fallout 4 with that plotline. lol
        That is one of my biggest issue with the game - that it tries to rely too much on the main story. In a un-Bethesda fashion it locks some parts of the game behind the main quest progression. The Institute and Brotherhood are both inaccessible without trying to find Shaun. While in Skyrim you can engage with most factions while not even becoming Dragonborn.

I'd be fine with the current story, as long as there was an alternative way to trigger the BoS arrival and finding the way into the Institute...
    I always forget the lack of quality of life things in NV like sprinting because I always mod them in lol
    This might be heresy but I think the story in 4 betters New Vegas in many ways. I like for the most part that 4 has a clear 'bad faction' to carry the first part of the main quest. Throughout the whole game the main antagonist is a clandestine organisation that appears almost omnipotent, yet when they finally truly reveal themselves there's an aspect to them many players may relate to and even find endearing. You're almost pushed to just explore for a period and their presence can be felt in most areas. After the reveal it becomes very clear how integrated they are into the whole wasteland and I genuinely found faction choosing more of a coincidence rather than an outright choice. 

In New Vegas, nearly all factions are a form of grey and it doesn't really suit to side with any of them by the time you reach the finale of the game. Many say it's good writing yet I feel it comes off cheap. The NCR are flawed, as is Caesars Legion. The Boomers, Kings, House and individual Casino's pose no real continuity for the strip. I always feel that going solo is the best for the wastland yet that route felt hollow to me. Even the legion which on the surface is a terrible entity becomes somewhat neutral when you realise that it's main rivals supports everything the legion does, just in a backseat way. It just all lacks focus. 

My main love for New Vegas lies with character interaction am individuals that fill the wasteland. No one in 4 really stands out yet New Vegas has many, whether it be the Van Graafs, the fella running out of Nipton, House, Boone... That is obsidian at their best for me. 

I think what's really great about Fallout is that every game in the series has it's perks. The first is an isometric forray into post nuclear war, the second just expands what the first one starts adding more depth. 3 goes into a whole new genre yet still captures the magic of what the first two has to offer. New Vegas expands the human beings which fill the wasteland and highlighting the plight which post-nuclear war possses. The 4th allows you the player to make your own bastion throughout the wasteland whilst showing how different factions form and coexist in a time where resources are scarce. There's almost a game for everyone in the series.
    I really liked the enclave as the villain in 3 tho
4 has the best exploration, it will always have a place in my heart for introducing me to my favorite franchise
    The one thing I don’t think anyone will argue is how well Bethesda builds their maps. Even though 76 gets dragged through the mud(and much of the criticism is well deserved) the world they built is amazing, even better then 4 in my opinion.
        I think there's a '76 achievement on Xbox, "Walked in a straight line for 2 minutes without getting distracted.", 6% of players have this.
            Yeah, I gotta call a bit of BS on some of those percentages. 

Too many times I've done this silly or mundane thing in a game, got an achievement, and see only like 4-6% of others have gotten it.

And I mean, sure I'd buy it for something really abstract like jumping on a particular object or something, but for killing X amount of enemies on a map? Really?
                The ones that confuse me the most are like the one from 76 that's  just "leave the vault" and it's at like 76% 

Wtf are the other 24% of people doing?
                    I mean considering it's 76 I can imagine many people turned it on immediately saw glitches and or bugs and just straight up never played again, but also yea 24% of the thousands playing it? Seems a bit much
        76 main failure is the lack of gameplay when exploring said world, a cool world is cool and all but when I have to fight the same enemies for the same reasons in every building it gets old fast
        "better then" :|
    I remember TRYING Fallout 3 and New Vegas when I was younger (like 13-14) and not really being into them. I played Fallout 4 about a year after it came out because it was on sale and my brother recommended it. It was amazing! I still love it. Because of that experience, I tried 3 and NV again and holy. Shit.

New Vegas is God tier.
        I don't know why, but the guns in New Vegas always felt the best to me.  I'm doing 4 again right now and the guns are fun & varied, but they don't click with me the way New Vegas did.  It has been over a year since I last played New Vegas, and now I don't recall WHY New Vegas felt so much better.  But that's OK; it's an excuse to go back and play it again.
It's always been great, but then I love all the fallout games. Tactics was my favorite.
    Really? I avoided playing it cuz people said it was bad and I couldn't get past the semi-turn based thing; would you recommend it then?
        I'd say Tactics is worth another go. You can toggle it to fully turnbased, but I honestly preferred it semi-turnbased as you could set your guys to automatically fire if they had x% chance to hit and the combat flowed so much smoother and faster. It's not among my favorite tactics games, those being new and old XCOM, Jagged Alliance 2 and Silent Storm series, but it has it's own charm and on the tier list of the genre, it's close to the top.
        Tactics,1, and 2 are all amazing. The majority of fallout fans just can’t see anything before 3
            Yeah I played 1 and 2 but couldn’t get into Tactics at all, it felt even more different
            3 isn't the first letter on the keyboard?
            I've tried playing the original two (I actually have them on disk from way back when I had my first PC), just couldn't get on with them at all. Gameplay bored the shit outta me.
        As a Fallout game, it's not great; but as a tactical squad game, it's actually really good, and the Fallout flavour is a nice bonus.
    that's probably the least popular take I've seen so far!
I only got into fallout because of fallout 4. I fell in love with it, and its now a game i run every couple years. I never got into to new vegas. Ive tried multiple times but its never really clicked. My brother considers me a heathen because of this.
    It's pretty old,  i feel like it's hard to get into when you're coming from f4 , which is totally streamlined and gorgeous. 

I have that issue with f2 and f1 i just can't get into them, despite how good they are.
        Have you gotten past the tutorial for Fallout 2? That's easily the worst and hardest part. If you have and can't get into it, I get it, but if you haven't I'd suggest just following a guide for the opening.
            I'll do that,  because i haven't gotten past that, yet. Thank you!
    I’ve had a similar experience
    I think it depends on why you want to play. I'm playing Skyrim again, after having not played it for years, simply so that I can trundle about and explore the world, which is rich and fascinating and full of texture, both in terms of the people and the environment. Oh, and there's some sort of story there; I'll get around to doing something about it sometime, maybe, or maybe I'll just abandon the game once I've done the interesting stuff.

I started playing Fallout 3 when it was mentioned on an archaeology podcast and loved it for the same reason. FO4 could have done with a bit more in the way of people and side quests, but the environment was wonderful. Even without the people, I enjoyed exploring FO76, a landscape that I can almost smell.

And then there's NV. I've played it a few times and it's good. Very good. I'm told it's very good. But the rails get to me, as do the lack of small details. The factions seem flat and one-dimensional and I think part of it is that part of it is that everything is feeding into this grand narrative that you can't avoid. There's no real dirt: stuff that's just there because it's there because it's there, rounding out the nature of the place. This is somewhat unfair to NV, which has a number of side-quests and stories like Come Fly With Me. But it's an overwhelming impression and the thing that always makes me think, "some other time."  I think the same of FO2 and Outer Worlds, so there's something about the style that just doesn't gel with me. Whatever it is is not what appeals to me when I'm looking for something to do.
    I had the same issue, my Beth game experience being Morrowind, Skyrim, FO4, then New Vegas. It was a jarring step back in terms of playability, even though the story was way better.
Both NV and FO4 are excellent. I actually prefer 4 to 3 (heresy I know), but all three are excellent games.
    Why heresy? 3 isn't all that special tbh
        Lots of people really love 3 and find it to be the gold standard, either that or NV
        I think 3 was great for it's time. But after 4 released there's pretty no reason to play 3 excluding nostalgia.
            Because 3 is still a great game? Do you stop playing an old game when the sequel gets released? Yeah 4 may be better than 3, but 3 is still really fun to play. I don't play it just for nostalgia, I play it because it was a good game.
            I mean I don't think that's entirely fair. Personally I hate fallout 4's story it just didn't connect for me and there is just something special about roaming a ruined DC.
            Liam Neeson.
                Was searching for this
I've played FO4 a few times over. Now I downloaded that cheat mod, just to have some uninterrupted fun. It's still an amazing game.
I'm so happy that this is a post not shitting on Fallout 4
Just sitting here waiting for the “Fallout 4 is a great game but not a great rpg” comment, where you at bro?
    It’s not wrong tho.
    I thought it was "It's a good game, just not a good Fallout".
    [deleted]
        Yeah. Dark Souls 2 was a terrible Fallout game.
            It wasn't a half bad Mario Kart game though, if you think about it
        what makes dks2 not a souls game? ive played them all and while i think it has the worst PVE, its still a souls game.
            I think those people didn't like the quantity over quality approach to the Souls 2 bosses. I haven't touched it in a while but it had 40(?) bosses in the base game and quite a few of them were very easy, compared to ~20 in both Dks1 and dks3.

Regardless, I agree. It's a dark souls game if it has 'Dark Souls' in the title. It might need improvement but it's a solid entry nonetheless.
        How is it a good RPG? I am genuinely asking because I have never been able to role play in this game(Vanilla).
You guys are hilarious. Every Bethesda Fallout was totally shit on at release, and years later you're all like "wow this game is amazing!" Textbook. 3, NV and now 4.
    That’s because everyone makes the decision to board the hype train every single time and get let down when reality kicks in and the game isn’t what they thought. The crowds move on and the dedicated fans stay, and they are the ones praising it years later.
        Agree. The Witcher 3 was buggy at release but today it is considered as one of best games of the modern era.

~~Cyberjunk~~ Cyberpunk 2077 will be praised eventually once they ironed out the bugs at release tons of free dlc but expect loss of support on xbox 1 and ps4. The game was designed for pc in mind so even the equivalent pc of console specs ran better off than consoles.
            Cyberpunk not so much. That game has more issues beyond just being misunderstood. The fact the game is borderline unplayable for over half it's userbase to this day is not a good sign.
                3 years in the future when everyone has a next gen console its going to be fine to think it was good, instead of the mess that it is on ps4 and xbox one
                Yeah, it's still not on PlayStation store, right?  I'm kinda using that as a bellwether.  When/if PlayStation store allows it back in, I'll consider it "OK" enough to play.  Until then, I'm just waiting on patch after patch.
                Still waiting for it to be fixed enough to do a first time playthrough, and it looks like I'll be waiting for a good while.
            Cyberpink will never get this treatment for sure.

Bugs, bad performance (even on PC on new RTX3000's), inherently boring gameplay, bad written story, physics worse that fucking Goat Simulator...

Sorry, that game can't be saved. It has literally no point where it is "okay". It's lacking in every department where a game can lack in. It's not even that the players didn't get what was promised. They got literal garbage.

Even No Man's Sky had at least the procedural generation, which gave it some uniqueness.
            I don't know about Cyberpunk. Bethesda games are completed games that aren't ironed out at all, but Cyberpunk was an uncompleted game that was rushed to release. Unless they're willing to totally revamp the game and either eliminate the leftovers or implement them (like making lethal vs non-lethal matter, as an easy example,) I don't think it will be propped up any more than a solid GTA clone with potential. 

But what we've got now is basically a template for the type of GTA/RPG mashup that a lot of gamers want to see, someone just needs to make it. And that race is different than the solo one that CDPR was running before.
                I really enjoyed Cyberpunk. Sure it had its bugs but the game is really fun to me.
                    It was good but still nothing that special (besides story and music) even disregarding bugs, which is not easy.
                        >still nothing that special (besides story and music) even disregarding bugs

So, the Witcher 3.
                            Kinda. Witcher 3 was much better though. Cyberpunk’s gameplay is good, both have great stories with high quality voice acting and the open world is amazing in both of them. (but there is not much side activities in them.) but Witcher 3 is the superior game overall if that makes sense.
                    Oh me too, I think it's a solid game. I just don't think it's anything that is going to improve significantly as time goes on, we've got what we've got.
                The game won't get a revamp and doesn't need it. It needs fixing. It does what it does pretty well. 

For the people who want a gta in the future they have to look elsewhere.
                    What I'm saying is that it already is GTA in the future. What it's not is a groundbreaking immersive RPG like the one that was promised.
                        Apart from an open world and cars it has really not much in common with GTA.
                            You mean aside from the base format of the the game world it's not like GTA? Seriously, this isn't criticism or even really insight, it's just the genre. Cyberpunk is *absolutely* an open world, semi-linear sandbox story game, like GTA. If someone said they wanted GTA in the future I would have no qualms about recommending Cyberpunk, it would probably be the closest I could think of. Maybe Saints Row IV, but that's a different kind of sci-fi.
                                One is an open world action adventure the other an open world rpg. Like I said they share the characteristics of an open world in which you can drive cars, other than that not much.
                                    Don't know why you're being downvoted. GTA doesn't have dialogue choices, levels, perk choices, builds, and various endings. People just see surface level these days and it makes discussion impossible if you want to add nuance.
                It was incomplete because of incompetent management while covid 19 forced developers to work at home. They didn't create a development pipeline for everyone to work toward; each developer was largely left to their own devices instead of being able to contribute to the overall team effort, which lead to a lot of the problems the game has today. There's plenty out there to read about it.
            Yeah no, it's only a matter of time until CDPR abandon that game entirely.
            This is like my friend with 76, bugs were one issue, but not the whole issue, a lot of 76's, Skyrim's, FO4's bugs have been fixed, but, in my eyes, they are still all unplayable.
        I loved Fallout 4 at first and now I dont wanna touch it
    76 got some good words lately as well
        I've played since wastelanders dropped when it started getting praise. Its a fun, basebuilding, exploration game with a huge detailed world to muck around in. If you've played and love 4 you'll love 76.
            Does F76 run better now? I'm kinda on the fence about picking it up (Im playing alone as well), but despite me having really good internet and hardware, I had weird hit detection and lags in the beta and on free weekends (like shooting at ghouls, but getting the hit marker 0.5sec later and laggy VATS, so not enough to make it unplayable, but pretty annoying)
                The gameplay can definitely still be pretty unresponsive, it's not great, but better than it was, coming from an avid 76 player. The latency varies quite a bit from server to server and how long the instance has been running/how much load is on the server at the time. Private runs very smooth, close to fo4 +whatever server latency there is.
            I'd try it if it wasn't multiplayer, but since it is I'll stay away.

Has nothing to do with the quality of the rest of the game, I'm just absolutely not interested in a Mp-Fallout and the differences that brings with it.
                It has pros and cons. I thought the same thing but then I started to do the events and daily quests. Having constant events and seasons makes it feel way more alive. I still play it like a single player fallout but now I can enjoy the new eve TS that happen like the mole miner treasure hunters that's happening now.
            >If you've played and love 4 you'll love 76.

I was expecting that, but nope.

76 took the things I loved most in Fallout 4 - exploring/hunting for junk, and digging up stories, and made me hate them.

I've got too many gripes with FO76, and no hope that they'll address any of them. I didn't care about the lack of NPCs, I just didn't want the game to feel like a chore, like work. But it did. And the updates they introduced only made it worse.
        I just wish it wasn't multiplayer. I know this isn't how most people play, but I like to play RPGs as a pack rat that picks up every single item. Being able to mod carry weight is a requirement for that.
            You CAN solo it now, but you have to have the monthly subscription to have private servers. I just started playing through it that way and so far it pretty much just feels like another fallout game. Not being able to pause sucks, but I'm having fun.
        But people should never forget that the game was designed as a crash grab for Bethesda since they seemed to be immune to any kind of criticism.

They didn't fix any bugs or Quality of Life changes people complain about since fallout 3, had barely any content or endgame, all Multiplayer components were buggy

And the game is pay to play, has a subscription model and an ingame shop and a season pass. 

So people keep in mind if you want to support this game and encourage Bethesda to keep doing this kind of work.
            I've been playing since launch. Never given them a penny. Literally - I bought the disc on eBay. Second character's about to hit level 200. There's plenty to do.
                At launch there was barely any endgame. Sure they fixed it with updates, but even with these updates they introduced daily or weekly limited resources like some mobile game
                    Isn’t there being no endgame kind of the point in a continuously, dynamically evolving online game like F76?
            I'd never get any game the requires a season fucking pass, that's so ridiculous


Season these nuts Bethesda
                76 doesn't require a season pass. 

You get it for free?
                    Nah it's 12 bucks a month if you want anything more than a bare bones grinding experience.
                        No its not? I bought it once and have gotten stuff from the season pass, like the clothing, power armor ect.
                            [I'm talking about this](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/10/23/fallout-76-now-has-a-premium-monthly-subscription-fee-no-seriously/)
                                Yeah they changed it a but from when this article was written 2 years ago. 

Currently it gives; Private servers, a scrap box, survival tent, monthly atoms, the ranger armor, and icons/emotes.
                                    It's not "required" but it's heavily implied those who don't use it are at a disadvantage to those who do. In an online game that can become rather unpleasant with griefers and stuff. And the only way to avoid them is the monthly subscription.
                Would you support season passes such as COD MW where everything on the season pass is only cosmetic based or blueprints but anything like new guns is free 

Not really pay to play, more like pay to flex
                    It is a slippery slope, that EA comment on here that was downvoted to shit is a good example of why.



Personally, I will put a game down for long periods of time and might not pick it up at all ever again. Spending money on cosmetic stuff like that and investing into it stresses me out more than I enjoy it because I feel inclined to play it over others. When I unlock stuff organically I don't have that issue.


And at the end of the day they're all obvious cash grabs. New content in games I think should be the most part free, or able to unlock through playing. It's definitely better for the gaming community itself.
    Some of us actually enjoy the games for what they are from the beginning.  We don't get over-hyped, we take in what they offer, and we find what we like or don't like.  I've never dumped on any of the Fallout games in the whole "Fallout X is the best game, Fallout Y is absolute garbage"-type arguments, or bought into the whole Bethesda vs. Black Isle/Obsidian views, and to be honest, I really don't understand the point arguing about of any them.  Each game has its own strengths and weaknesses; there are places where each of the games absolutely excel, and there are places where they just don't work (sorry, Todd).

And, as always, time softens everything.  As people play the games, many of them forget the bad and remember the good.  It's how the human brain operates.  Fallout is far from the only example there as well.
        Enjoying games for what they are is the motto I live by. It's how I've managed to love every single game I've ever played, and love every movie I've ever watched (for the most part).
    Heck even fallout 2 was a complete disaster at launch, it literally took 15-20 min to save or load your game.
        Thats weird, i didnt have this issue with fallout 2
    Jokes on you, I liked Fallout 4 from the start
    Its more the fact that new people come into the series, and older fans leave.
    I still think 4 it's a huge downgrade, too streamlined, too casual, less bleak and more happy post apocalyptic theme park for all families and children, the gameplay felt like a skyrim mod tbh
    Ha not playing at release gang
    Nah 3 has always been ass and always will be to me. Dont know why people like it so much.
    Imagine thinking that a Fallout subreddit with a few thousand users is indicative of what the general gaming population thinks about Fallout. You'll see the same cycle of opinions because subreddits are just echo chambers of the same opinions. Break out of your little bubble and you'll see most people still rank NV way above 4 and 3. Hell even mainstream journalism has caught up, you won't find a single publication that ranked 4 above Skyrim or New Vegas in a "Best of 2010's" list.
    This is definitely happening with 76 too. It currently feels more like fallout than fallout 4 did.
    Online communities are made of multiple people. Over time people come in and out of it, or change their minds within.
    I never had bad problems with 3, NV, or 4 on release. I played all 3 the days they came out and 4 was the buggiest by far on release, but still was completely playable. Hell I still play all of them, so no, not everyone boards the hate train like you say we do, I’ve never shit on any game just because someone says it’s shit, I play and form my own opinion just like most of the people in this thread. I love all the fallout games and yes, even 76 (which is my least favorite though, fallout shouldn’t be multiplayer) I fell in love with the fallout series because they are huge open world rpg single player games and Bethesda better go back to that with the next fallout.

    Having a better gameplay than Fallout 1, 2, 3 and NV isn't exactly a challenge. The combat in these games suck.
        And the AI if we're being honest. With high enough Stealth anyone can pick off raiders one by one, in front of their friends, and they'll just go back to whatever they were doing like they didn't just see Jerry's head explode in slow-mo.
            See, this issue you're describing is the kind of thing I hope they fix in the next Fallout and next Elder Scrolls game.  I want the next generation of these games to be more realistic in the NPC programming, but I fear that what we're going to get is just "bigger more."

There was an interview with Todd about the sequel to Skyrim, and he said something like, "If people enjoyed Skyrim for years, then I want the next one to be something they enjoy for decades," and I just wanted to barf.  I don't want a game that is so damn massive that I won't complete it before I die.  But I *do* want a game that is more immersive, more "real" feeling, and that requires only 3 things: better writing, better graphics, and better AI.

And I don't need MUCH better graphics.  If I'm happy with Skyrim in 2021, then *whatever* they have in the coming years will obviously supplant that.  And I don't even need much better AI.  I just need *some* more depth.  Can they just erect barricades when they see/hear their buddies getting stomped?  Can they close a door and ready to ambush me when I burst through?  Can they relocate to another building or higher ground?  Can they fall back and ally with another group so that they have strength in numbers?  Can they raise a flag of surrender and hope I spare their lives?

I've done programming most of my life.  I can imagine creating some modules for this kind of responsiveness.  The real question is: how much can they cram in, and are they even being asked to do it?  From what Todd said, he's creating a very massive game world that is incredibly shallow.  But I'm going to cross my fingers and hope for more.
                I think the biggest problem with the AI is that it was never designed with ranged combat in mind.

"Creation" is just a highly modified Gamebryo, and that was meant for sword fights.

Yes, the AI could still use better tactics and behaviors, but the biggest issue is it doesn't know how to treat an attack if it isn't a full on melee fight, because the second you crouch from a far enough distance the AI loses you and reverts to standby.
    I actually liked the main quest more then 3's, but I think that's mostly due to so many people comparing me to my dad, having their favorite topic be my dad, me asking about my dad, and generally feeling like my dad was a holy figure.

People will say that there's no urgency to find your son in fo4, which I agree you forget about your son a lot, but that allowed for the other characters and conflicts going on to take more precedence.
It’s made to suck you in to the environment. Fallout New Vegas shot for storytelling, and Fallout 4 shot for exploration.
I've said this before: I'll say it again.

**I have more hours logged in Fallout 4 than I do in New Vegas**. Given how goddamn much time I spent elbow deep in the coding of New Vegas, that says a lot.

There are very legitimate complaints to be made about Fallout 4, but those are flaws, not dealbreakers. Yeah, the dialog system sucks. Yeah, the plot is shallow. Yeah, giving your character so many fixed points of backstory is incredibly limiting for RP. There's still a **ton** of improvements and new features that provide for some fantastic gameplay. Power armor, dear lord the power armor....
Get the fuck out of here Todd. We know it’s you
    You joke, but Bethesda, like most companies, has a team of fluffers that do nothing but post this kind of shit all over the Internet. Opinions are easily swayed over time because everyone's glued to their screens.

Fallout 4 is not any better or worse than it was when it was released. It's graphically pretty, has better gunplay but it has a shit story and is a shit RPG because they made bad decisions and spent too much time on settlements. 

But these posts will keep coming, just like the 76 posts.
        I would really interested to see any kind of proof that any company practices this.
        I would argue that it is better than when it released because of survival mode. That added so much replayability to the game.
        there are a ton of people who actually like FO4 its been my fav since launch personally. I personally think its a good RPG not storywise but gameplay wise. The skills and synergies are better than older fallouts IMO and i feel like I can customize my character way more in 4 than in older Fallouts through gameplay not story. People liked it since day 1 its just the giant circle jerk of hate in the beginning drowned out the people who did.
            Same with Cyberpunk. I avoided all media on purpose, until spent 100 hours in the game. Had exactly 3 bugs/glitches. Before patches.

Console launch was terrible and there is no denying that there were bugs. But the overall experience I personally had was amazing.
                Respect i disliked Cyberpunk but i can see why people did like it. Personally I got a few game breaking bugs but if ya didnt get any of those I imagine it was pretty fun!
                    Story and side missions made this game enjoyable for me. You can watch it as a movie.

I played on normal difficulty, but once I got some perks in to handheld guns combat became extremely easy, instakilling everyone. That helped with the "movie" like gameplay.

I will replay it again in a year or two. I hope I will have for a challenge then.
            I like Fallout 4 just fine. I made a whole thread about [modding it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/7fpf28/how_i_learned_to_love_fallout_4_by_modding_it_to/) so I could like it more.

However, it is not any better now than it ever was. It's a middling Fallout game, as Fallout games go.

>The skills and synergies are better than older fallouts IMO 

Yeah, you're probably going to have to stand alone on that one, sorry. :)
                It is definitely not better now than ever. But like you said circlejerks are powerful and people were attacked for just saying anything positive on launch just cause it it wasnt New Vegas 2 story wise. Now that the hate has calmed down peeps now talk about it more positively. Its definitely not a bot squad by Bethesda to support a 6 year old game that they dont support anymore.

And I definitely am not alone the old skill systems are kinda dated (literally a board game system) and there are a lot of just useless stats (Ex. Charisma in New Vegas). I start differently in New Vegas but then always nearly max everything by the end. You can make way more diverse builds in FO4 with the insane amount of toys they give you.
My big issue with fallout 4 is that I sort of think the acquisition of loot and powering up sort of died off at some point in my playthrough. So I had thousands of caps with nothing much to spend them on, and was just clearing locations without finding any new guns or upgrades. Also, your fighting mostly reskinned versions of the same enemy for the back half of the game. 

Also, a lot of the characters fell flat and since you can sort of join every faction the story in the game seems to be a bit disjointed. All your doing is fighting to let whichever asshole have control, but the player doesn't have much agency in the overall plot.
And we’ve reached the point in the cycle where we love Fallout 4 now.
Fallout 4 is absolutely amazing.

It gets a lot of hate, and some of the critiques are deserved. However it's a solid game. It emphasizes a lot of what makes the series so good: exploration!

People love to compare it to NV in terms of conversations and RP, but I always have found comparison to be a bad one. NV is an amazing game too, however the circle jerk around it is annoyingly massive. It also has its problems, it's not perfect. It shouldn't be the metric of comparison for every other FO game.
    What's different between  the old FNV circlejerk and the new FO4 circlejerk?
        The “old” FNV circlejerk is constantly ongoing. Constantly overlooking flaws. Constantly criticizing other games in the series for those same flaws and then making excuses for NV.

Most of this rehab of 4’s image comes with acknowledging and accepting 4’s flaws and jumping off the hate bandwagon towards it and enjoying it for what it is.

To answer your question, it’s night and day.
Launch: This game sucks

(Updates, mods, a few years)

Now: THIS GAME IS AMAZING
Yeah I done a new play through and forgot so many of the side quests. Amazing game
I’ve recently started a fresh run of fallout 4 after years of being dormant. I’m surprised by how much fun I’m getting out of the base building mechanics this time round. It’s impressive how much this game feels like new to me with quests & locations I’ve long since forgotten.
Fallout 4 is my favorite for this same reason too. Sure some things could’ve been better, but over all I love the details, stories and surprises too.
The only thing I don't like about fo4 is how it runs. Otherwise I adore it
So far fallout 4 is also my favorite game, for all lot of reasons, but being able to sprint helps.
The main storyline is not interesting at all.
People shit on fallout 4 for the story mostly, the gameplay and the environment is dope though.
Fallout 4 is easily the best in terms of exploration and environmental storytelling in my opinion, but New Vegas for sure is the better RPG, and its exploration and environmental storytelling are definitely nothing to scoff at either. I think we could go back and forth deciding which game is the best Fallout game, but ultimately, they ALL meet the wants of a specific fanbase and that’s enough to consider them all great works of art.
Fallout 4 is the best fallout game in my opinion too. Glad people are acknowledging this
If you originally played it while simultaneously checking and participating in the sub it doesn't surprise me that you didn't enjoy it as much. When Fallout 4 ended up trying to break into new territory and offer a new experience instead of just trying to recreate New Vegas's strengths people here lost their minds and refused to see past that. While the Role Playing didn't hit a home run the exploration, world building, lore content, visuals, and overall tone of Fallout were all massive strides in the right direction and made for a great game. It's not Fallout New Vegas 2: Newer and Vegassier, but still a great game that offers a ton of hours of enjoyment for anyone who claims to love the Fallout Universe.
    i disagree partially. a lot of people who are fans of fallout didn't like fallout 4 not because it wasn't fnv2, but because it strayed so far from the original tone and themes of the three fallout games written by black isle/obsidian. i enjoyed fallout 4 as a game but i believe it provided no profound commentary on the messages of its predecessors. it effectively said nothing while being incredibly polarizing, and while they could have tied that back into a lesson for the player as a sort of meta thing, they didn't. for that, i was really disappointed and it's why i say fallout 4 is a bad fallout game because i really value the perspective and writing of the games before it.
    Yeah why would people expect a sequel in a franchise they love, dumb New Vegas fanboys, eat looter shooter shit.
I completely agree. I love New Vegas but something about Fallout 4's environment and atmosphere hits different. That and I think it has some amazing characters. I hate exploring the Mojave because of how dull it all is (which I suppose is fitting as it is mostly desert, but still) so I used to fast travel everywhere but I find myself actually walking to most locations in Fallout 4.
Best fallout game fuck no, but I respect your opinion...fallout 4 was a great game.
In my opinion, the sheer amount you can explore can be overwhelming, I know, open world, you're gonna want to explore but sometimes Fallout 4 can feel so dense, you know? A little bit like how Ubisoft games make me feel with their gigantic maps.I'm currently replaying Fallout 4 with mods and I still don't hold it higher than 3 or NV but to each their own, I'm glad you like the game.
    While I personally think FO4 is the best of the series so far, the D.C. subway tunnels will always have a place in my heart. FO3 nailed that balance between an action RPG on the surface and a survival horror game underground, IMO.
F4 is the only one I have finished and I never get tired of replaying it. I've played it since release and the only place I haven't explored is the Glowing Sea because it scares me even in easy difficulties. I still do the same glitch Minutemen ending where only the Institute is destroyed, every single time, and I dont care.

Customization, characters, side missions, random events... I dont even have DLCs and keep replaying out of how nice it feels.
Not the best, but one of the best, if it was a better rpg and respected the lore a little more it would be the best
Biggest disappointment is the lack of songs on Diamond City radio. F3 and New Vegas definitely win that one.
    Wdym there’s a ton more songs than fo3 or new Vegas.
I love fallout 4 because it is the single fallout i can launch without modifying the files so it dosent crash. Another thing i love is the fact that i actually look at some npc that resemble humans not potatoes. The sprinting , perk tree and power armor/weapons modifcations are superb. Althought the dialogue system is lacking and i hate the fact that my character has a voice I still consider fallout 4 a good game and a good fallout.
Fallout 4 was quite underrated at the time of release tbh. My main issue with it is how you can't repair your weapons, removing from the survival aspect of it massively.
Hot take: it’s got a better story than Fallout 3, as well tbh.
    Which isn't exactly difficult. The main story of FO3 sucked.
        I kind of agree and yet many see it as a far superior narrative experience to 4. 4’s story at least created a lot more debate in the community than 3 with its choices in faction endings.
            The main story of FO3 was pretty bad. FO4' main quest was meh, but its main issue was the side quests, the absurd majority of them are just "go there and kill all enemies".

FO4's "dungeons" are all corridors, which also sucked. In FO3 I had a lot of fun playing as a stealth sniper going through alternate paths to sneak upon my enemies. In FO4 you don't get that option because you just go through corridors, even if you invest in stealth, lockpick, hacking and everything else.
                I agree there were too many “go there and kill everyone” quests in 4.
                I do agree with the basic side quests but you can 100% do a stealth sniper. Most of my playthroughs are a variation of stealth and it may be annoying early game but late game you can go through almost the whole game wiping entire dungeons without being seen by anyone.
                    Yeah, but while walking in a corridor. There isn't the part of exploring and finding alternate ways to avoid defenses.
    "Family member leaves Vault to find other Family member, gets involved with Brotherhood of Steel and fights a technologically superior enemy for the fate of the wasteland"

You mean that story?
        You can finish the entirety of Fallout 4 without talking to any single member of the brotherhood of steel
            Missing my point, it's pretty much the same story as 3. The major plot points are there, and kinds shows for all the time they spent improving the game's mechanics that they kinda phoned in the story, but you're a mindless fanboy who can't take any criticism, of something they did not make no less, and will just angrily downvote my reply.

Maybe leave an angry message accusing me of being an idiot/hater or combination thereof.
                I downvoted you because what you said was low effort bait lol. Your comment drips with irony, accusing me of being angry or missing the point lmao. I don’t care what you think about Fallout 4; you’re the one who missed the point lol. 

At no point did I say the parallels between 3 and 4’s story weren’t strong, or that 4 reached the storytelling heights the story reached in the past with New Vegas. Nor did I say 4’s story was it’s strongest asset. 

I just said it’s story was better than 3’s. And I stand by that. You inferred everything else. Honestly you should’ve expected a low-effort rebuttal with how low effort your original attempt to bait a response out of me was lol. Have a good one now
                    Sorry, I simply don't take anyone serious with more than one "lol" in a paragraph. 

Have fun maturing, kiddo.

Edit: for historical context, the first paragraph had 4 "lols" before they edited it. They removed one, and turned the other into a "lmao".
                        Man next time just save yourself the time and write “I give up” or don’t write anything at all
Exploration is pretty fun, but the dialogue is a huge step back, combat (melee especially) is bad, replacing uniques with legendaries was a terrible decision, the new skill system is shit forcing artificial grind and keeping you underpowered, factions were boring, color scheme is off, everythings sort of balloony and too rounded, lack of populated settlements, karma sysyem replacement was bad, weapon upgrade system was lazy (basically another artificial grind).

That being said it had a lot of good things too. Power armor was dope (though imo you should get it later), character creation was amazing, exploration was amazing, settlement building was cool (It doesn't work for left handed people. The menu keys are the same as arrow keys, which I use to move). The looting system was a huge improvement. Crafting material system was good, made junk actually useful.
    There are still unique weapons in F4, combat is better than all other Fallout games. I like the style of the game, easily the best one. Not sure what's lazy about the weapon upgrade system. The skills, karma and factions are big agrees though, loved those parts of the previous games..
        Theres tons of different upgrades but they don't really change much. Its 3 different tiers of upgrades. Each tier has the same upgrades just better stats. Ones higher damage, ones higher rate of fire etc. The next tier is just higher damage and higher rate of fire.
            No offense, but sounds like you never really bothered to learn about the weapon upgrade system, beyond “hardened>powerful>advanced aaand I’m done”. It’s true that there are straight upgrades within certain categories like semi automatic or automatic, but these are mostly for receivers. Outside of that you have flamethrower attachments for plasma weapons, scattergun conversions for laser weapons, a variety of sights and scopes to customize the effective range and VATS effectiveness, even conversions to different ammo types. On top of that, you have the constant interplay between damage and weight (and therefore AP drain in VATS). The system isn’t perfect for sure, but it’s far from lazy and is actively encourages people to interact with the best part of the game, the exploration.
                Yeah there were a lot of upgrades, but for the most part there were clear best ones. The energy weapons were definitely better., but they just used it as an excuse for removing a bunch of weapons, lmg, tribeam, plasma thrower, plasma defender, etc. They had some unique upgrades, but stats wise most of them just were not as viable, considering the enemies were leveled, unlike previous games (sorta).
    Power armour was an excellent idea executed poorly, any of the mods that revamp it make it so much better, imo it stinks of execs being like no this is cool we want it to be available immediately to players not unlocked as you carry on
        How do mods rework it? Make it so you get your first fusion core after the  first one way later?
            I forget the name, but I seems to recall a mod that replaced the armor in Concord with a shitty Raider one, which made sense, and made Cores/Frames harder to come by... or that may have been two mods.
    Facts
    A perfectly valid criticism downvoted. These reasons are pretty much why I never finished 4 despite all the shiny stuff in it
        As a standalone game its pretty solid, but with multiple previous games it had a lot to live up to.
    Based.
I love f3 the most but f4's graphics and all the stories its just amazing agreed
I like how they made power armor such a big deal. Being inside is immersive. The fact that runs on fusion cores limits the use for really important situations. Something like "Oh, is time for power armor!!" As you march to your target with your raid crew.
You should try Survival mode, it made Fallout 4 on par with New Vegas for me. I personally love 4, New Vegas and 3, all for separate reasons
The only issue for me is the weak RPG elements and felt like. A downgrade in that department from the previous games. I still love Fallout 4 though, it’s a great game IMO.
Fallout 4 bored me because of the lack of choice you have. Every dungeon is basically borderlands shoot'n'loot as opposed to offering some sort of story or interesting characters. I like New Vegas because the writing and dialogue Trump everything else, and the character build and player choices actually matter. Fallout 4 is a dense world, but paper thin on intrigue and interaction. And don't even get me started on the lackluster end of the story.

I'm also not bashing you for liking Fallout 4. This is just my personal opinion and I totally respect your opinion. I think that with NV's writing team and game mechanics and 4's world builders they could make a great true Fallout experience.
Shouldn’t have read about people’s opinions when you first played it. Might have liked it a lot more right off the bat.
Can’t wait to revisit it on my Series X with the new 60 FPS mode.
It’s always been that fucking amazing!!!!!!!
It's even better in VR.
I would've liked Fallout 4 a lot more if they didn't try to shove the settlement system down your throat.
I got a 3090 last week. Weapon debris causes game to crash! All I wanted was to play my favorite game maxed in 4K and I’m left without one element! The things people say and when you shoot someone you can here them release their last breath. All the details and humor is why I love it.
    https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/48078 I can personally confirm that this works
Took me a total of 3 restarts to finish it. (This is not a game you walk away from for a few months and start back at a save point IMO) With kids and work, it's tough to find time to play such a game. Well with the pandemic, I found myself able to play it from start to end in about 3 weeks. An epic game 100%.
Fallout 4's gameplay is awesome, but the story and world building suck balls. That's why I'm excited for FO4:NV
I can’t play other fallouts when I’m living and immersed in 76 so much, I’m Soul-bound to Appalachia..
I love Fallout 4 and have ever since the day it was released.

Nowadays though, I play it modded it with an ENB and many other gameplay mods. The base game is still great though. Love me some Fallout 4. I recently started playing the original Fallouts.
This looks like a thread that started a similar hype that did 180 on New Vegas.
Totally agree with you, NV has a great story and characters, but the cool thing about F4 is that the exploration and gameplay is really well made, that with survival mode is just tons of hours of a great time. Certainly New Vegas is my favorite bit I have a lot more hours and fun in F4.
You didn't mention mods. Once you discover that your doomed, and you end up with 700 mods and a game that inexplicably still works for 5 minutes at a time.

Then Everytime you think about something that's not quite perfect about fallout 4 you think to yourself, 'i bet there's a mod for that:.
I think alot of people including myself were just disappointed in the lack of rpg elements compared to previous games that made them so fun and repayable...
I loved Fallout 4, problem is I loved Fallout: New Vegas more.  It had so much to live up to that even being a great game wasn’t enough in many peoples eyes as it had New Vegas behind it.
Most if not all of the locations in fallout 4 have something that tells a story of some sort. It is interesting and nice.. It's super easy to lose yourself exploring.
Tinker Tom is the best, lets inject battery acid dude
The game is still phenomenal to this day. I’m really hoping that they got the message with Fallout 76. I’ll speak for myself when I say this, but I don’t want a game that I have to play with other people. Fallout 5 should be everything Fallout 4 was and build upon that. Better graphics, better FPS, and I wouldn’t mind a story that is twice as long as the one in Fallout 4. I would consistently pay for DLC if they put out a Nuka World or Far Harbor quality content instead of what they’ve done with 76.  If you’re going to build a world like they have, why not keep refreshing it and adding to it? May be asking for a lot, but I think that it would make them far more money in the long run.
Story and character-wise, I prefer New Vegas. Location, gameplay, and exploration-wise, I prefer 4. they both have their strengths and weaknesses, and I'm very happy Ive been able to experience them both
Im finishing up a NV playthrough and it made me want to try 4 again.

Im excited to replay it again, my first playthrough i fucking hated it, only bethesda game i never did a second playthrough of.

 Terrible dialogue, ran like garbage on console, real locations with story and characters cut to make way for the 50'th blank settlement, story was bethesda trying to do a new vegas choice system but having no talent for it, Nuka world being the worst DLC bethesda has ever made(Ah be evil and burn your settlements or literally get nothing)

But weirdly enough, im stoked to go back. I hope its a much better experience on a Series X cause man can it not be any worse.
fallout 4 is one of my favorite games period
I just found out that it works on my laptop. I’m ecstatic right now
I enjoy fallout 4 but the problem is when the same npc ask you to visit the same place for the second time and then you realised everything respawned in this place including the items you picked up on shelves and stuff. Then your immersion will be severely damaged.

Also infinite number of quests can be a good thing but as a result you just do bland boring repetitive tasks and really fast in the game your character is overpowered so it add to the boredom.

But its way better than fallout 3 at core and the modding community can turn fallout 4 into what you want it to be so its fine in the end
Have you tried Survival mode? If not, prepare for your opinion of FO4 to rise tenfold. If you are already playing Survival, then I completely agree with your assessment of FO4.
I love Fallout 4. I still play it to this day and watching RedRicketTV's playthrough of it, I have over 2000 hours into it, And it's definitely top 3 of my favourite games of all time. That being said, The exploration of Boston was amazing, the story was alright. People hate the story was so much but honestly what was the problem? It gave 4 full fledged factions to side with. The dialogue wasn't great, but the companions and pretty much everything else minus some crappy graphics are awesome. Love Fallout 4.
To each their own man. Personally I just heavily prefer fallout 3 and nv in comparison especially when it comes to the role playing aspect. But fallout 4 is decent have an upvote fellow vault dweller.
I just wish it didn’t give me fucking motion sickness.

I don’t know why it does. Skyrim, FO3, and NV are fine with me.
Unpopular opinion, but fo4 story is OK. It ain't bad, it ain't good. It's OK, like that random film you watch because there's nothing better on. I love the ambient and side elements, tho. The base building is cool with mods, and I miss it and the crafting system when playing new Vegas and 3.
This will never be seen but I have a theory on this. When Fallout 4 was announced the hype was UNREAL. Expectations were so high that game was never going to deliver to people's fantasy of what they wanted it to be. Now that it's 6 years later the hype is down, Fallout 76 fucking sucks even now, and so we have developed a somewhat newfound love and appreciation for 4. Is it the best fallout game? Subjective. Is it a great game though? Hell yeah.
Loved FO4. I was hooked when FO3 came out, I played NV, but I just...too many game breaking bugs that ruined my experience. Plus that stupid radio Playing Johnny Guitar on repeat almost. Loved the DLC for NV, Specially Dead Money. Loved the Casino spots and the different nutty stories they had for almost each casino. But the Whole NCR vs Legion thing, the outfits bugged out and it basically reset my standing with them each time I Swapped an Faction Outfit. It was maddening. Loved the Companion system we got over 3 at the time.

4 basically upgraded things from 3 and New Vegas I liked.

FO4...just had what I wanted from 3 cranked to 11. Once they added Mechanist and The Overseer DLC (Vault 88) I was hooked. I spent so, many, hours building in my Vault. Im a Sims player, so this was like heroin for me.

Loved having my Companions as basically Vault Security when the Super Mutants showed up at my door step. The music my turrets made tearing them up as they got past the threshold of my vault door...
FO4 just never clicked with me. But neither did new Vegas.


I've decided I just don't like fallout. Nothing wrong with enjoying it though!
Its like i always thought
I always had FNV and Fallout 4 as my top 3 most favorite Fallout games,modding is what really glued me into Fallout 4 and always will
Now try some of the mods
Hmm. I must have played some different version of Fallout 4 then. Cause mine was a one, large dungeon with respawning, random enemies to shoot at and mcguffins to receive.
The newest game in franchise is always trashed until the next one comes out and people all of the sudden love it, people hated GTA IV until GTA V was out, it’s just the way things are, nostalgia and all that.
I installed a immersive gameplay mod on my new pt last night, it took me 1 hour to get to dc from the super mutants settlement where the hazmat suit is, coupled with weather redux (rad storms+darker nights) no hud, you will get lost a lot.
Just started Far Harbor yesterday. I bought season pass on release, but then got addicted to CSGO around same time. Some 2500 hours later - I am enjoying FO4 and DLCs.
Ouch, now I see it on sale on PSN and I feel like getting it
Fallout 4 is the best fallout game. The problem was with the generation of console it came out on. Now I bet fallout 4 runs spectacular on the new gens. I know fallout 76 runs amazing.
I’m not sure if anyone else will agree but it’s a bit...TOO detailed. There’s just so many stuff to do and as a completionist who just HAS to finish everything in the game, after the main story the fact that there’s still hours upon hours of gameplay drove me a bit crazy. 

Also fallout 4 is very annoying because it’s not linear so everything in the game can change based on how you play it, if I skip something by accident then it’s just gone. The game never spoon feeds you and it’s an amazing gameplay experience but also exhausting.
So here's the thing, Fallout 4 did water down the game SIGNIFICANTLY in places, and that can't really be denied on any measure. However, it still did PLENTY of good things in its own right, and the factions it presented, the world it built, some of the cool new weapons, among other systems (which one of my favorites is making power armor FEEL like POWER, ARMOR, not just bulky knightly armor that any schmo can slip on with...training?? Training is one thing but the suit just acts like normal in older games...so huh??).

Fallout 4 is a great game, but like Skyrim and other such games, the game was neutered by Bethesda's laziness and stripping down. If Fallout 4 and Skyrim had their core good traits while incorporating the good traits of the past games in their franchises, they would be masterpieces by now, I say.
I played FO4 once at release before putting it down till present. 

I was pretty dissapointed with it really as my expectations were so super high after playing FO3 like a million times and FONV a dozen or so times.

I think ill play it again some time soon and see how my feelings of it change to how you feel.
I just wish Bethesda would fix Fallout 4's long list of problems. It would already make things a lot better. This not including the main storyline that was stolen and adapted to become the mess it's now. The original was NEVER meant to become a new Fallout, just be a mod for Fallout 3 and that's it. It got so much corrupted that the story in Fallout 4 is actually broken beyond repair. You are forced being the good guy and the dummy that keeps running just to help settlements that can't handle anything, even with placing more then enough turrets trough mods that easily takes care of 100 deathclaws they still manage to mess up and loose. It also takes away from the way you wish to play, exploring is limited because you keep running back to 'safe' a settlement with more then enough security in place. Aside from quests that are shoved down your throat and keep pestering you until you finally do them, only to get the same result with the next quest...

No, Fallout 4 is a broken mess and we can't go around that or look at the modding community to fix the mess Bethesda left behind. So Bethesda, please fix Fallout 4 in that regard so it's playable without the mess we have to deal with now or needing to install mods to fix things. Simple request that should be no issue at all now that Microsoft took over and funds the studio. Have some people work on it and it will all be fixed in no time.

Also, please remove that in-game store. It breaks more then that it fixes. It is cause of crashes and unwanted extra lag. On top of that, everything in it should either be already in the game in the first place or shouldn't be there at all. A lot of it is also broken and adds to the lag and crash issues. Also by forcing people to download data that they can't use and having that stored on their hard drives while being locked isn't nice, it's a mess no one wants. It's a scummy thing to do.

For OP's personal feelings, sure go ahead. Happy you are enjoying it.
The exploration is great, the story, writing, quests and RPG elements are pretty awful, that's what really matters in a fallout game
5 hours in you forget you're looking for your kid.

100% immersive.

Best.. Game.. Ever..
You know what the funny thing is? A lot of Fallout fans kept shitting on Fallout 4 ever since it's first release 5 years ago. But somehow, Fallout 76 and other "live-serviced" Triple A games riddled with bugs and microtransactions made them appreciate Fallout 4 even more recently
If you don’t enjoy unique dialogue or interesting quests and just want a first person looter shooter than yeah it’s the best fallout game. Call of duty Boston
dicking off and exploring the commonwealth for hours is so fucking fun, no other fallout game really has the same expirience
The verticality in FO4 really set it apart from 3 and NV. I remember being amazed I could climb up all these buildings and structures without having to load a new cell or anything.
As a Massachusetts resident, I can tell you, the atmosphere and feel of the world of Fallout 4 is spot on. It really does feel like home to me.
Fallout 4's gameplay is just so much fun. It's def my favorite fallout game, although it was also my first
its an ok game :)
The map is great, but the total lack of charm or interesting quests just makes me feel like im walking through disneyland, all show no tell.
I feel like it's the best gameplay wise, and the worst RPG wise by a mile in both directions. Little to no actual choice in questing, and a story that refuses to let you make your own character.

But as you said, the exploration is top tier. The game is such an enigma to me lol. It had everything set to be the best fallout game but abandoned a lot of it's RPG roots.
Have you played survival mode? Everything you said about the game is 10x as good in survival mode. It adds a nice difficulty layer to the fun of exploration and immersion. I was so happy when that mode came out, and it made the normal mode much more fun to play as well.
What Fallout 4 lacks in story and depth, it more than makes up for in other aspects. Exploration, the overall ‘50s vibe, the huge selection of songs on the radio (FO4 has 37 overall, compared to FONV’s 5, FO3’s 29, and FO76’s 50), downtown Boston, the Glowing Sea, the settlement system, some of the side quests, the gunplay and modification system, the revamped power armor, and of course, my boy Nick Valentine. It’s not a perfect game, but damn does it have some really fun moments, and a lot of good things about it.
Aside from being forced to build a machine to get to the Insitute... Fallout 4 is incredible.
Had the literal same experience recently surprisingly?
Fallout 4 is so far my favourite. A big reason for 
 that is that it was my first Fallout Game and I am currently playing Fallout 3 which in Terms of Mechanics is a lot simpler and more limited which makes it be a bit less fun than 4 even tho I am still enjoying it alot. My only real problem with 3 is actually the combat. That one is kinda shit but apart from that it's amazing.
I like the economy. Chems, water and caltrops (which cost just 5 steel to make) are a great way to make money early game.

I also think the story gets shat on a lot. It is rigid I'll admit, but the twist about your son was actually pretty good.

As a lore junkie I really hope they advance the stories a lot in FO5 and ES6.

It seems like forever since I've heard these great stories about civil war in Skyrim and the fight for the Hoover Dam in the West.

At leats FO4 moved the story from FO3 along well.
Whenever I go back to FO4 I'm always like, is this all there is? We go from Skyrim to this?
Because it’s boring and a further deviation of what “Fallout” is. I just wish they cared about the lore to the franchise that they acquire.
It might be an unpopular opinion but I loved the base building sim in fo4. I spent so much time building up my towns and learning all the tricks to make the walls around the town seamless! Ah I really miss it, might revisit it soon!
Yup. Take my upvote. That was my impression of the game as well.
just started playing it - I am blown away how great it looks and how immersive just walking around is. I am on my toes at all times and truly have been frightened - then you blast the ghoul and its instantly turns into comedy. 

I get the gripe that its not "exactly fallout" in people's mind, but don't really give a shit.

Also, when I got to the horse track - that has been my favorite part so far. Kellogg's memories I thought was a surprisingly good touch. My biggest gripe is the whole curie story line - I feel like its kind of some weird pedophilia stand-in (a older person, teaching a young naive person they ways of the world - grooming - and then have a relationship w/ them. its weird.
f04 is bae. it's beautiful and plays like an FPS shooter more than an RPG which works for me.
The problems with fallout 4 were never the world building. The problems were the reduced variety of dialogue response options and the redundancy of quests. Every response was yes, no, snarky yes, and what? And every quest was a basic fetch quest, or go kill something and come straight back, with usually no added layers. Personally, they got tedious for me, but you're entitled to like what you like. I just hope in the next one they have dialogue depth and varied quest structure more similar to like fallout new Vegas had but with the same world building as fallout 4.

Oh yeah and I HATED how they changed the skills  system to be less RPG and more action game like, but maybe that's more of a preference thing. Adding voiced protagonist lines also removes all possibility for roleplaying.... Ok maybe I had a lot of problems with it.
Exploration and different builds are why fallout 4 is amazing. And honestly I really do love the companion system it has. Flawed of course. But I love it
Yeah then you play any quest and do any dialogue and everything goes to shit. Fallout 4 is a great open world game but a horrible fallout game/ RPG. I just replayed the entire main quest and it’s so sad how bad and basic all of the writing is, I mean I guess they upgraded the combat and other open world stuff but the quests, characters and just writing in general is so, so bad compared to New Vegas
I had a lot of reasons for hating Fallout 4. I beat it twice and have tried to replay it so many times but I always get bored and quit. For me the fact that you could choose any faction in New Vegas and that they each had unique storylines and side quests that you could take part in and The fact that you could do these quests before even reaching The Strip and that you could avoid certain quests or even entire factions completely without ever knowing was amazing to me. I mean if you did all the specific little things for Arcade Gannons quest line, you could have the Enclave help in the final battle, that blew my fucking mind. But for Fallout 4 every faction had the exact same questlines with the exact same reskinned quests and all the side quests were "fetch this, clear this building, save this synth". The only memorable side quest to me was The Silver Shroud which wasn't even that cool. It had moments like blowing the prydwen up or even that quest where you got the Pirate Ship to fly was cool but all and all it was a pretty boring game to me. Plus the way they did the perk system was dirty god damn was it so bad. They replaced the hundreds of unique creative perks in the older games with basic "20% more damage with (insert weapon)" perks. Plus no game has ever matched an antagonist like Ulysses god damn was that dude cool.
Fallout is phenomenal and I don't care who says otherwise. And the dungeon design (if you can call them that) is so much fun to explore.
My first fallout, would say one of the best games I ever played.
Fallout new Vegas ha always had the best story and quests while having the worst exploration and world. While fallout 4 has the exact opposite of that. Fallout 3 seems to have a mix of both
I agree.  FO4 is still my favorite FO game, even though at this point I have far more hours into 76.  3 and NV were good, but as good as it is I think NV is overrated, and doesn't deserve its god-mode type reputation.  "HURR YOU CAN'T ROLE PLAY" is such a tired argument about FO4.  You can RP to your heart's content.  It's no less linear than any other FO game.  3 will always end up fighting over project purity where you have three options on what to do.  NV will always lead to the battle of Hoover Dam where you have three options of what to do, and FO4 will have four options, three of which lead to one similar outcome, and the 4th leading to a significantly different outcome.
The only thing wrong with Fallout 4 is the dialogue choices in my opinion. Everything else is dope
    It kills me when people say, "You can just download a mod to make the dialogue like the old games!"

Yeah, that doesn't fix the dog shit writing, though. FO4 is seriously devoid of interesting quests and characters compared to any Fallout game before it.
        Yeah dialogue in general wasnt its highlight
The underwhelming story (sorry if you enjoyed it, but the majority opinion seems to be it wasn't great) overshadowed a lot of the good aspects of the game, and killed a lot of people's motivation to get back into it after completion. 

Now, after some time has past, and with foreknowledge to help temper expectations those looked over aspects of the game can be given the attention they deserve.

For all the criticism the game has gotten, and deserved, there is an enjoyable experience underneath it all.
    Outside of the extreme haters, I don't think people claimed that Fallout 4 wasn't enjoyable. Fact is that it was a pretty good game all things considered. Problem is, the franchise, and Bethesda's track record called for more than just good.

&#x200B;

Fallout 1 and 2 are two of the pillars of the CRPG era in the mid 90s to the early 2000s. Morrowind is considered one of the greatest open world games ever, Skyrim was a global phenomenon when it dropped, and Fallout 3 was revered when it came out even if it didn't age well, while NV is considered one of the best RPGs of it's generation.

&#x200B;

Like it or not, that's the standard. If it was made by someone else under a different name, it would be talked about much more positively, but it wasn't. They have to be able to manage the expectations they've brought onto themselves from a multitude of fan bases. They don't have to appeal to all the different crowds, but they have to stick to something and execute it to live up to that level.
"Best" is a strong word.
Fallout 4 is the best fallout game? You're a funny guy, that was a good one 😂😂😂
It's meh
Man I’m tired of Fo4 hate. It’s has the best gameplay easy and while the story isn’t as strong as nv, it’s still just as good. It’s the perfect balance of distorted, and communities rebuilding. It does suck the factions are more black and white, but that and story aside it’s amazing and is as good as new Vegas easy if not better
    It’s not just as good, 4’s story is so bland and forgettable. I don’t care about looking for a kid I have no emotional attachment to
        Kid? Who are you kidding? Anyone with half a brain could've figured out that the kid will turn out to be an adult based on 2 simple facts.

1. You get refrozen for an undetermined amount of time after your wife dies.

2. Bethesda is too fucking lazy to make a novel and engaging feature like parenting a child into adult hood. They would never spend a single second developing an engaging way of caring for an actual child in the Wasteland. If you simply remember that Bethesda takes every possible shortcut, then it's easy to guess the big "reveal". I was more surprised that I originally came across the child Shawn and could not believe Bethesda actually did their best there. And then nope, utter disappointment.
Fallout 4 is really a great game, you just have to appreciate it for what it is. Sure, compared to almost any other Fallout game, even Fallout76 there are less core RPG elements, but it is still an awesome fucking game regardless and one of the best for Fallout lore...even if they barely reference new vegas 😡😤
Yeah, 4 is definitely better than new vegas for me. But it isn't my personal favorite.
Meh.
My major gripes with Fallout 4 come from a dialogue perspective. Bethesda just never had the writing talent that obsidian had which is why (at least in my opinion) it failed to really get you invested in what was happening in the game. It succeeds in what makes a good shooter but fails at what makes a true RPG.
Forget about what made Fallout great in the first place, interesting plot and story development !
It's a great game, and I've also recently made a comeback after a long absence. For me, the drastic change in design (from the abject bleakness of FO3 and NV to the verdant forests and brightly colored buildings of FO4) was pretty jarring at first; it felt a lot less like "post-apocalyptia." But there's a lot to love; interesting characters, fantastic voice acting, incredible atmosphere and music, god-tier power armor gameplay mechanics, etc.

It's also much less of an "RPG;" you are kinda stuck playing Nate and Nora. However, assuming you can just accept that, Nate and Nora kick serious ass. While I hope the next installment returns to some of those FO3/NV design and RPG roots, it's a tough sell convincing anyone that Fallout 4 is a *bad* game. It just isn't.
I just wish the quests weren't shit 

New Vegas level quests in a map as good as Fallout 4 would be the perfect Fallout.
Fallout 4 is one of the worst Fallout games I've played. The dialogue is completely trash. Even Fallout 76 does more RPG stuff now with all the updates, and that is really telling.
Outer Worlds is my favorite Fallout game.
Fallout 4 is pretty trash. Like skyrim, it just looks pretty.
They made a fine shooter with an open world and a survival mode. But it sucks as an RPG. The speech options suck worse than Skyrim, which only had just enough speech and dialogue to be a good RPG. The story was okay, but a real let down on the path of the Capitol BOS. But yes, I do enjoy playing it.
Awesome another echo chamber post
For all of the many, many things I dislike about Fallout 4 and Bethesda's take on Fallout as a whole, they are excellent at creating environments that are simply enjoyable to poke around in. It's been pointed out before but their habit of littering locations with permanent stat upgrades makes exploration actually rewarding and interesting, and their writing is way better in the little bits of incidental text you find than the main stories and quests. They're just straight up compelling exploration games, no matter how much 1+2+New Vegas grognardery I engage in, and I absolutely understand how people can just lose themselves.
Have you been paid off by ol' Todd to spew that shite?


No, this has to be sarcasm.
    Send him off to slime town
Are you fucking high?
What the fuck of everything.

Fallout 4 is great for wandering around if you utterly ignore everything else a game like that should be.

Fallout 4 is maybe the fifth best Fallout game, if that.
What have you been drinking to delude yourself into believing this bullshit?
I've always said that FO4 was a great game but a bad Fallout game.
    You and a million others
>Fuck it. Fallout 4 is the best fallout game.

I respect your right to be wrong. It's not nearly as bad as people say, but no lmao.
Saying that FO4 is better than NV is a sin
>Plays a game that was made in 1,5 years


> Plays a game that was made in seven years


WOW FALLOUT 4 IS SO DETAILED. 

That's not really a fair comparison.
    OP’s not condemning the devs, they’re just pointing out that one game has more detail than the other.
        Yeah, and why do you think that is!

Maybe because one game had 4 times the amount of time put unto it. That's what I'm trying to say, 

You grab a game that was rushed out in 18 months, play it, then go to a game that had 84 months of development time put into it and you make a post on reddit "WOW THIS IS SO DETAILED". Bruh, of course it is.
            The point is you’re railing against a criticism that doesn’t exist. OP’s not saying there’s no good reason for there being less detail, just that when you compare the games FO4 has more. The comparison doesn’t have to be ‘fair’.
                It does have to be fair, because otherwise it's invalid
                    For critiquing the performance of the developers - yes

For describing the contents and merits of the game - no

OP was going the latter and not the former.
The problem isn’t that fallout 4 is great, in fact it’s a huge step down from the previous titles, but Bethesda designed the game like a slot machine that always wins where no matter what you do or what direction you go there’s always something that feels good, be it a sound effect or a screen pop up or just a random quest or whatever, it’s like the game is designed to impose the sense of having adhd on you and then treat it at the same time
> I mean the world is so overwhelmingly detailed that it’s hard to decide where to go and you get side tracked so easily,

**WHERE'S SHAUN?! WHERE'S MY SON?!!**
The only thing I like about Fallout 4 is the exploration. Everything else is mediocre or complete garbage.
I find it weird that people can like this game but hate Cyberpunk.
Fallout 4 is fucking great imo, only thing that let it down for me was having a voiced main character.
The music in Diamond City brings me to life 😩
The glowing sea was *muah*
The load times just killed any buildings I found. If there was a loading zone, I just wouldn't explore there lol. So I probably missed out on most of that stuff sadly
i have been playing for 100 hours now, i am at the road to freedom quest, which is kinda mid story, the side quests are so fun that it makes you forget the main story xD
i just got a vr setup, and im a huge fallout fan so i had to buy 4 even if the reviews were not that good. there were a couple setting that needed tweeking, but it looks like after a couple years they got it pretty stable. Its absolutely amazing seeing all the fallout assets live size and 3d. exploring fallout 4 in vr is extremely overwelming, but i love it.
It's 16 times the detail!
I got the game in 2016 and it was very underwhelming and disappointing. My brother convinced me to try it again this year and with all the dlc and mods it's a blast
Fallout 4 was definitely the best intro to the series and it makes you appreciate New Vegas even more.
I bet with some choice mods it's down right one of the best RPGs out there. I own it but I haven't played with it in years. Maybe I'll play it when I get home.

*Plays Total War: Attila instead because I can't leave things unfinished*
It's detailed, but compressed and memorable.  I know where everything is in the game.  Boston was amazing when I first saw it. It feels small today.  Open Worlds are like that.

I'm near the end of a FO3 play through after starting a few times and bailing. I would say that what you see on the screen in 2021, leaving vault 101, is not a great fist impression.  I decided this time to stick with it a little longer and I got wrapped up into it.  

What I like about exploration of DC is that it is tht it is cut up into sections vs being open like Boston.  In DC, I still get lost.  I constantly am going in the wrong direction.  Many times I don't even know where I am.  It is the transition of tunnels to street that creates this.  No matter where I'm at in Boston, I still know how to get back to the settlement in the alley.
 I kinda agree. The main story is still eh in my opinion but the rest is amazing. The exploration, the dlcs the gun play and mechanics
[I have always loved FO4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfAo3QTCeZU&t=1s) despite a couple of its shortcomings. Of course, a lot of this is rooted in how disappointed I was in FO3, which took itself far too seriously and was really clumsy gameplay-wise.
Bethesda did an amazing job with the world design, exploration and customization aspects of Fallout 4. Unfortunately the writing, story and RPG aspects took a big hit and left a lot of fans disappointed. It all comes down to what you want from a Fallout game.
get vr and live it for real
Fallout New Vegas is my favourite Fallout game,
Fallout 4 is my favourite Fallout themed shooter
I've been playing it latly on pc and I'm constantly running into bugs. Right now I'm at the part where you get into the vertibird to go take out the muties and for some reason it won't let me enter it. Also the vault tech dlc isn't working Clem won't get onto the bike.
I love FO4, the only thing that puts New Vegas ahead though is that I prefer seeing several civilizations in the wasteland. It lends a lot of authenticity to the world, the idea that society would become fractured and colonies, husks of society, would form. I don’t like that Diamond city is the only real naturally occurring civilization, makes it feel like in this big open world they only focused on one small area.
I think the hate for fo4 really stems from the dialogue, voiced protagonist, and the fact that the game treats settlement building as a main big thing and the builder isn’t all that great. Imo it should’ve just been a base builder, and they should’ve had more pre made settlements.
I loved Fallout 4 but after doing all the faction endings I just had to install mods and you guessed it mods make Fallout 4 an unlimited fun game. Highly reccomend on Xbox or PC!
Every Fallout game is amazing if you wait a few years for all the bugfixes, the dlc, and about 40 mods worth of improvements.
I’ve got thousands of hours across multiple characters and not once have I finished the main quest. I focus too much on scavenging, managing settlements, and selling things.
The three things that got me to enjoy Fallout 4 were:

1) Silent Protagonist

2) The dialogue mod that shows actual responses as choices

3) Abandoning the main quest and just exploring everywhere with Heather Casdin
Fallout 4 is really amazing but at least for me it crashes a ton and have a lot of bugs. And no I don't use mods
If you want it to be buttery smooth check out [The Midnight Ride] (https://themidnightride.github.io/index.html) config.

It really works wonders with the game in all aspects.
I love Fallout 4's world and just its overall immersion. My only problem is the lackluster NPCs and sometimes even the lackluster quests.
I won't go so far as to call it the best Fallout game but I do enjoy the hell out of it.
They are working on a new engine and hopefully Fo5 will be legendary af!

.... In a couple years.....
If you think the base games that good your mind is gonna be blown by ultra modded fallout 4
I tried it a month back, still lose all frames in downtown boston and crashes/freezes.

I have hope that one day it'll be playable, just not in my lifetime lol.
I have never once finished fallout 4 story, and the reason is this. I get distracted. I finish some quest that I think is cool, I loot some building or a raider nest, I start making something in my settlements, roleplay, etc. There is so much to do, that I put the story on hold, and thus, after a few playthroughs, I have yet to once finish the game.
It's the only playable Fallout on the PS4 (76 doesn't count), but I had so much fun on my two playthroughs and there def will be a third one.
Love this post, I don’t even fully agree and I love your energy and passion for 4, and your reasoning behind your opinions. Lovely post OP. Well freaking done
I have no problem with you liking a game so long as you can accept me hating it.
Played all 3, fallout 4 was good just not the best, and when the next thing you've got is 76 it looks a lot better also lop
It's best feature is how modable it is.
Except some companions, far harbor and the wanderer i never mised a single thing about fallout 4 since i tried 76. The Commonwealth is really boring, specially compared to appalachia. The coolest shootout in f4 is a walk in the park compared to a medium sized event and 76. And 76 has trading, events, big bosses, seasons, story content updates, daily ops, photomode, it even features the best fallout dialogue bethesda has ever done. Oh and can be played with friends. The stories in f4 are few and they mostly consist in go there, kill that. I dont understang why would you do it again.
In Joseph Anderson's review, he calls it a great game, just not a great Fallout game. And I agree. If you want a wasteland rambling experience, Fallout 4 is awesome. If you want an intense, involved story with clever solutions and branching paths, it's not ideal.
Just don’t do any quests for the minutemen as long as you can and you will only rarely get a settlement in trouble quest. Not building up or recruiting anyone to anything but sanctuary can also help. This is just my own experience in my latest play through. I’m tryna do all the locations and then do the main quests and such
Fallout 4 story is mediocre compared to the other fallout games imo
I adore FO4. I am still heavily disappointed in the story, but really everything else is incredible and there's so much to do. Not to mention the dlc alone is astounding. Far Harbor is probably my favorite dlc of any game still. Nuka World is just belligerent and fun. If I'm getting sick of the wasteland and Preston has finally run out of settlements for me to help then I'll just go be a raider and do a huge takeover of the wasteland. 

That's not even including the other extra dlc stuff or mods. 

Also Deacon. Deacon alone is enough for me to keep playing. I enjoy most of the followers and characters but Deacon is something enticing and magical.
I didn't play any other fallout games other than FO4 but if I could I would.
Man I hope it will be the same gradual progression with fallout 76. I have my doubts though
[here they come](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EndxvoEuq-8)
Every-time I start up fallout 4 I’m blown away and I wonder why I rushed the Institute Storyline. Then I keep playing and remember how few guns there are, and even with all the great characters and awesome cinematic moments, I get bored.  I’ve probably only ever explored 1/3 of the vanilla game.
I like fallout 4 alot too.my only to gripes about the game is gaining health when you lvl up and it doesn’t feel post apocalyptic like its too colorful
Fallout 4 Far Harbor is the best fallout content out there.

Fallout 4 itself? Not that much.

It could have been great.
Fallout 4 is my favorite game of all time. Recently got 100% achievements
Next, get wabbajack and get a modpack for fo4.
Its good!



....untill it crashes (Xbox)
No fallout game has as food and complex characters as Fallout 4. Just look at Nick Valentine!
Fallout 4 is no doubt a good game, but it is a horrible RPG.
I'm in a similar boat 4 at launch was fun but it wasn't new Vegas, which I was ok with but the lack luster story and  the change to the perks and special systems to me just made it fall flat at the time. I recently replayed it while I still have the complaints above I spent a lot more time exploring and trying to do side quests that I really enjoyed myself and have a new view on the game. If you get a chance try out sim settlements 2 it's such a good mod with a decent questline and it sent me looking in new places.
Fallout 4 was my first Fall out game, And the experiance was amazing tbh, ive heard it gets alot of hate but to me its up there with Witcher 3
I feel that when people discuss Fallout 4, the main comment most would say is that it is an absolutely stunning and detailed open-world game. Its evident that the developers put in plenty of care and detail to make post-war Commonwealth as enjoyable to explore as possible. But then we come to the story and it just doesn't hold up to the standards of those found in earlier titles.

I believe someone said it here on this subreddit before: "Fallout 4 is a great open-world adventure RPG game, just not a great Fallout game."
f4 is an awesome ADVENTURE game, and a mediocre RPG game.
My absolutely favorite game of all time and I have to replay it annually.
I loved fo4 but the amount of glitches and bad writing kinda messed it up for me
Many A True Nerd has a great video called “Fallout 4 Is Better Than You Think”
"GoOd ShOoTiNg GaMe BaD fAlLoUt GaMe."

I always know I can sufficiently ignore any opinion from someone who says that dumb shit.
4 certainly is the most fun.
And mods make it so much better, too.
I think it’s fair to say Fallout 4 is really good, I do think the story, it’s overall message, and the dialogue needs extensive work though. That’s not ignoring the fact that it is a fun game to play, has a plethora of different things to get caught up doing for hours, and is just mindless fun. 

Different people want different things from these games and that’s why I feel Bethesda/Obsidian should always be working to compete with one another. Fallout is easily one of the biggest goldmines in gaming IPs regardless of what someone tells you. There’s a whole world to explore over decades of conflict, Pre-War, Post-War, 200 years after the war. It doesn’t matter, a good story and immersion is all that you can ask for really. 

I think I’m at a point where I’m wondering why there isn’t a studio dedicated to pumping one out every 4-5 years. This new Bethesda engine is going to be insane for whenever they decide to make a new Fallout. I’m hoping this Microsoft acquisition allows for some more people to be dedicated to Bethesda’s lineup. Hopefully mods are always supported because the modding community has kept Fallout 4 alive for SO LONG.
You know why? Cos all of those YouTube hate circle jerks are out of your mind now. The game was always a great game. It just fell short in *some* aspects. The game is still a brilliant game and I actually agree that it's possibly the best Fallout game.
F4 is great. 

Even better with mods (just got an Xbox one recently. Figured I'd play it for the 50th time.)
Mods really breathe fresh air into it. Bug fixes, weapons, Minutemen improvements.

Makes a huge difference to me.
I just started a new game after a while away , and yeah same feeling really loving it.
Fallout 4 on a more efficient engine and without the voiced protagonist nonsense would probably convince me this is valid.
Fallout 4 is by far my favourite game of all time and it introduced me to my now favourite series and made me discover how much I love open world RPG’s. A phenomenal game that mesmerized me when I first played it and still does.
of course it is...

and 76 sucks
I preferred new Vegas or 3
The game is just fantastic and so much fun. The world, characters and just feel of exploration and traveling around made up for the somewhat weak main story. I always felt the side/commonwealth building stories were so amazing and filled out so many things. All of that makes up for any short comings that the game may have had.

And once you know what feel you want and dive into the rabbit hold of modding, the game just becomes so enjoyable.
That's what makes is one of THE BEST VR GAMES! I just lose myself in buildings, rubble, backwoods, etc...

It takes mods to get "hands" which aren't the best, but with those and the level of immersion in the world building, it's the best open world game made for VR so far. 

YMMV but Fallout 4 VR essentials installed from here is a great way to experience Fallout 4 with a VR headset. [https://www.wabbajack.org/](https://www.wabbajack.org/)
    Since you mentioned mods.

You can transfer saves from the VR game and non VR game.

You can mod the DLC into VR. Which literally makes the game fucking epic in VR.
    SkyrimVR is the best open world VR game!
        Have you tried Morrowind VR? It's quite good as well. 

I go between FO4VR, SkyrimVR and OpenMWVR basically as I sold my soul to Bethesda recently it appears...
            Same here. Cannot wait for SkyOblivion to launch so I can play Oblivion in SkyrimVR with all the VR enhancement mods.
                There was some talk about SkyWind a few years ago, but I wasn't good enough at English to comprehend completely what was being said.

 Now you mention Skyblivion, may I ask you if you know something about it?
                    Basically the same thing as Skywind, Oblivion rebuilt on Skyrim's engine.
                        Thats awesome ill actually be able yo play morrowind now. I couldn’t get over the awful combat.
    As much shit as Fallout VR got at launch, I have to second this and say it is my favorite VR experience I have had to date. I've played 20 hours and barely made it through 3 quests because I keep getting sidetracked exploring.

Also in VR, Fallout really makes you want to take it slow. I almost never use my run or even walk full speed outside of combat. It just feels so much better and more immersive to walk at a realistic pace, which makes everything take loads more time but I'm okay with that because I am just so happy to feel like I am in that world.
    I think fallout 4 VR would make me a very happy man but I can't justify that cost.
        I'm right there with you, bud. Oh well, guess I'd better go buy a lotto ticket.
        Yeah don’t spend the money unless there’s other vr games you wanna play
Wandering the wastes and trying to survive its a ton of fun.
    Survival fallout 4 improves the game 10×
        Really like the immersion of survival. Aside from the occasional death being so very much more frustrating
As someone who disliked more than they liked about Fallout 4, you'll get almost no argument from me. After I realized it was just Goodneighbor, the Hill, and Diamond City for populated areas, it took some of the thrill out of exploring. I like exploring for the cool and hidden interactions you can find, not just as going around looting and shooting. That said, the actual world itself and all the locations clearly had a ton of love put into them. 

Also, while it's not the base game, I'd agree that Far Harbor had great exploration with absolutely 0 caveats.
    Yeah the big thing holding me back from loving Fo4 is lack of towns and questlines, so many places are just shooting galleries with a terminal to read. The best mod I have played is Tales from the Commonwealth by the guy that did Interesting NPCs for Skyrim, because it adds more quests and human interactions to some of these places that had no real point. Also adds some great new followers. I highly recommend Audrey the ghoul in the Third Rail.
        My favourite follower from Tales from the Commonwealth is Birdie! I love all the hilarious lines he has as commentary during the main story quests.
            He is great too. He was the first one I found, and we traveled together for a long time before I decided to look up where to find the others.
        I’m not sure if Bethesda for Fallout 4 tried their best with the writing, and it’s the best they can do, or if they didn’t try much at all. I’m not sure which would be worse.

I just wish they went in on either choice. Either get rid of traditional NPCs and make a more survival exploration focused game with significant additions to the gameplay, or make a game with a story that’s not garbage. Fallout 76 is the former, but without any of the additions.
            Mostly I think they ended up with quantity over quality in terms of content.  255 distinct quests, with a bunch of those repeatable/radiant. 17 permanent companions (if you count dogmeat and the random robots you can build).  Four main quest factions with distinct and overlapping quest lines.  It's... A lot.
    Same! What I would have done differently, take the settlement locations and build 75% of them into functional towns with at least one named settler that acts as a leader... then split them up between all factions 

And create a civil war type quest line of claiming all the settlements for one faction.. but allowing you to do so through, combat, dialogue, sabotage, alliances, betrayal, etc.
        This along with some of the sim settlement features built  in would have been great. 

Also a proper raider faction from the beginning. When you first go to Bunker Hill you can claim to be a raider, and your character yells it in a very aggro way, making me think at one point you actually could be a raider during development.
            Nuka World is a thing, so I wouldn't be surprised if they had that storyline in progress, couldn't finish it in time so cut it. Then, they simply did their raider thing for Nuka World.
            Yeah with all the cut content it sure does sound like they wanted to let you go raider
        That would’ve been great. But Bethesda is lazy and stupid. I’ve been playing fallout 4 for several years now and not once have I managed to build in all of the settlement locations. Hell after a certain amount it becomes pointless. You end up having to help a settlement while you’re still building. I rarely go the Minuteman route anyway. The building aspect is fun but they overdid it. They should’ve at least added a couple more towns with some named people in them. They could’ve added towns to act as Railroad safehavens, they could’ve even added a few more small towns to walk through. In fallout NV every town had ppl in it. Not this one tho
            That’s right. The established settlements are barren, and have zero dimensional settlers that give you radiant quests.. it’s too empty
                Seriously, though. Would it really have been so difficult for them to add in some unique NPCs and questlines for each settlement? I'm sure there are mods that do it, so that's something... but it easily could have been done in the base game.
                Yeah they literally have the player building the entire world just so they didn’t have to actually put cities into the game. They should’ve put a different engine in it. This game probably couldn’t even support another city added. Simply walking around in town makes your screen go stupid

    I was working on a Sunshine Tidings settlement, and paused mid-build because the weather in-game was clear and I had a gorgeous view where I could make out the Corvega plant and the skyline of downtown Boston.

This game can be ridiculously good-looking at the right moments.
        Especially if you add mods that make the lighting more realistic and add stars in the sky. I have a mod that makes the environment as dark at night as irl and also a mod that replaces the bland sky that with a more impressive night sky with many stars. Because after 200 years of no vehicles or many factories being used the sky should have a lot more stars than just a few specks.
When you start modding, the game is a new game every time you try a new mod set. It just keeps giving. All hail modders!
I feel like that's something even the most staunch critics of the game would agree to(I consider myself one of them). Exploration is the primary way of interacting with this game.
Yeah yesterday I just decided to walk around doing nothing and it was super fun. Even if I found a location I already knew about from a previous save it still felt super fun just walking up on it.
 But that story bro. I agree with the vastness and the exploration but man o man, the storyline was absolutely embarrassing, and the dialogue options? Dont get me started. But Im an optimist. Let's hope whoever does fallout 5 understands what we yearn for. I want the scary, dismal, depressing, story with terrifying new monsters.... I want the factions, like a choose your own adventure book that goes into incredible detail depending on who you side with which comes complete with hundreds of ending options. I want to build better bases, with hundreds of craftable items, and a storyline sperate from the main one when it comes to base building. I want it all. Fallout has the potential to be one of the greats of all time.
    I can still remember the excitement of not knowing wtf the institute was but hearing constant references to it, then travelling there myself..  that shit was thrilling. Having no idea what to expect and then being transported there and meeting Father..  I don't play fallout 4 for the plot but that was an aspect loved.
I think they took the lessons learned from New Vegas seriously as well.  Companions in FO3 were a joke.  They were just there to bullet sponge and thats about it.  There is little to no depth to them.  Yeah, Fawkes has some touching moments, and who doesn't love to hear him go **YYEEERRRRR HA HA THERE YOU ARE**, but other than that?  Meh.

Companions in Vegas though?  Oh my goodness,  yeah some are more meta than others, but the stories to all of them are intense and really draw you in.  From Veronica and her deep conflicts on what to do about her family, to Boone and his torn heart, to Arcade and his family ties?  Holy smokes, there is so much to process with them.

FO4 really tried hard to copy that Vegas feel with your followers.  It isn't exactly as good as what they did in Vegas, but they did a great job regardless.  The added depth compared to FO3 I really appreciate.
    "Yeah they didn't do that good, but don't worry Bethesda we can't expect to be on the level of a studio that's been on the brink of bankruptcy its whole life."
It seems nice until you realise that 80% of locations have nothing but a holotape or computer log, generic leveled enemies and generic loot in a steamer chest at the end.
    Literally just about every single location you stumble across has something of interest for you to find. And not just basic obvious things, you are genuinely rewarded so much more for looking in nooks and crannies compared to almost any other game including the prior BGS titles.

Beyond generic loot and junk (actually useful for settlement building and weapon modding) the are countless areas that offer world building or lore good old fashioned easter eggs through prop displays. Like Skeletons in precarious situations both funny and sad, teddy bear or gnome displays, makeshift campsites or even settlements that you can poke around and learn about what happened there, references to pop culture or other games etc. etc. And that isn't even touching on actual collectables like Bobbleheads, magazines, figurines etc. Hell even the holotapes and logs you are poopooing are genuinely great sources of lore, world building, or just basic context about the area where you found them and can lead to further things to explore.
    Lol downvoted for talking shit on a boring game, the state of this subreddit.
Yep, fallout 4 is a great open world but horrible fallout game. It’s writing is so ass but it does have great open world elements
Explore, combat, loot. It’s the only thing the game does well, but goddam it’s done REALLY well.
It nearly perfected the Bethesda Loop.

Explore to find resources ->

Full up on resources and return home to craft ->

Craft more and better equipment to explore new areas ->

Repeat

The story and writing is *impressively* bad, but if you just treat the main quest as a series of progress gates for the exploration and crafting, then everything falls into place to give you a supremely entertaining exploration, combat, building, and modding sandbox.
I only touched the main story when I was gated from exploration, so after 50 hours of fucking around, I finally finished the main story. Too bad it wasn't like FO3 where I skipped 70% of the story quests by just finding my dad, but loved to explore and loot everything!
Disagree. FO3 and NV were much better for random exploration.
    FO3, fair play. But NV? It's an empty desert mate, and feels like it.
To clarify, saying “think this game sucks” isn’t the same thing as shitting on a person for what they like.

The shit almost always starts because some really insecure fan gets offended that buttlicker39 says “Mass Effect 2 Sucks”

Love what you love. But remember that not everyone else will love it too.
    Agreed. 👍
        My favorite reddit interaction so far was when I said something like "I don't like the new star wars movies but I have nothing against people who do" and then immediately got downvoted and called toxic.
            Good for you. They’re just butthurt that a shit ton of people hated the sequels and they’d rather blame it on toxicity instead of the issues in the movie
    Ok but I will actually fight someone in a parking lot if they say Mass Effect 2 sucks
        I don't know about "sucks" but I'd say it's easily the weakest of the three. It massively scaled back nearly every mechanic compared to one - armor, weapons, weapon mods, abilities, etc. The only thing it really improved mechanically speaking is the shooting and cover systems. I never understood why it didn't get more flak for that especially when you consider that the follow up to Biowares other big RPG Dragon Age II did basically the same thing and people won't shut up about it.
            Well Mass Effect 2’s gameplay had something DA:II’s didn’t: it was actually fun. And while I love a good looter shooter, Mass Effect 1 was not one of them. I found the loot to become repetitive and boring about half way through the game. Everything felt like a slightly different version of what you had before. (I do love Mass Effect 1 though. The loot just isn’t one of the reasons I love it). 

As far as story/characters/world goes, Mass Effect 2 is  the best one by a mile imo. I love collecting this team of different, powerful people, getting to know them, and having it pay off (or not) in the final mission. And they kept all of the characters from ME:1 in in some way, so I didn’t miss any of them. ME:3 has the worst new characters imo, and I was never a huge fan of either Kaiden or Ashley. 

All in all I think they’re all great games though. Mass Effect 2 was just the one that hit me the hardest when I first played through them all in like 2013.
                I thought DA2 was plenty fun, just in a different way. More of an action game than a strategy one. I do agree with the loot complaint for ME1 - I think ME3 really struck the best balance between complexity and fun. I just never hear anyone mention just how dumbed down 2 is which is so weird to me.

The story was....eh. On a micro scale (quests and characters) it was fantastic, but the macro story was also really scaled down. You went from saving the Galaxy to just kinda trying to save a few colonies. The threat was scaled down from Galaxy ending reapers to these weird enigmatic bug dudes. The plot in general was literally just go get people until something happens. It just wasn't nearly as engaging or interesting overall, even if the individual stories and characters were great. That's another issue I've heard brought up with DA2 that never seems to be a problem with ME2 - people were constantly complaining about how scaled down the plot stakes were. I mean, don't get me wrong, I do like 2 but I always find myself just really wanting to hurry up and get to 3 when I play it. Even if the story is stronger in some ways, the gameplay is just so much more scaled back and disappointing.
        Mass Effect 2 sucks
            Aiight I’m outside Denny’s where ya at?!?
    Gonna start a new account as “Buttlicker39”
        Go with my blessing
    > To clarify, saying “think this game sucks” isn’t the same thing as shitting on a person for what they like.

Exactly.  I mean, even though I've written pages-long dissertations on FO4's many, _many_ failings, I still played the thing for hundreds of hours and made almost as many mods for it as I did for _Fallout New Vegas._  (Although the majority of them were of the failing-corrective nature.)
    Well for those who don’t love it... no one is inviting you to share those opinions in a thread that is praising the thing you don’t like. It’s just as easy to keep your mouth shut.
        This is true, though one exception is called “Constructive Criticism”. If you're going to criticize something, then say why instead of just “This is poo-poo”.
            I hear what you’re saying but you can’t critique someone’s opinion. A critique occurs when a creator invites an audience to discuss their feelings regarding a thing the creator is presenting. Then the creator listens and takes it and says thanks. No debate. No differing opinions. Just a critique. This thread is not that. 

This thread is a celebration of a thing. An opinion someone has. Which one could be critical of but why? Why walk up to a group who is drinking beer just to say “I don’t like beer. I prefer wine.” What’s the point? To share how you feel? Why? 

My point is: If the OP or anyone who holds the game in high regard is expected to have enough self respect to not care when someone else dislikes the game then those who dislike it should also have enough self respect to not care when they see someone enjoying it.
                I 100% agree. Though this is something that can't be stopped. People will do it anyway.
                >	This thread is a celebration of a thing. An opinion someone has. Which one could be critical of but why? Why walk up to a group who is drinking beer just to say “I don’t like beer. I prefer wine.” What’s the point? To share how you feel? Why?

Sure in that situation it’s weird. But this isn’t a private conversation. **It’s a public forum** where anyone following the rules may participate in any discussion they wish. 

If you don’t want people to disagree with you then why did you come to the place specifically for discussion? 

If you want a place specifically for celebration then start a sub and ban anyone critical of the games. 

Anyone who comes to a public forum and thinks people with a different opinion should keep them to themselves is a hypocrite.
The first 10 hours of fallout 4 are perfect.
    That is true, just pure science fiction goodness..
    Only the first ten? If the first ten are perfect then the rest is too.
        At hour eleven he got to The Railroad and realized that something was not well in The Commonwealth.
            I will defend my honor as the best railroad heavy in the commonwealth good sir. ;) not everyone likes them thats okay. I came from the ballistic weave and stayed for the people.
                I really wish Glory could have been the railroad companion.
                I don’t have any sort of problem with the railroad as an entity; I sided with them too. The problem I have with the railroad is the same problem I have with *all* the factions in the game: they are terribly written. I think they’re all pretty equally bad though, and the only reason I pick on the railroad is that it’s maybe the earliest that you can realize just how horrendously stupid the story is.
                    The writing was really my main gripe with F4. OP has some solid ground here imo, it is a fantastic game with hours upon hours of gameplay to offer to even the most picky of players. 

But I have a powerful bias for great writing, dialogue, and story-telling, and that’s F4s worst components. Also I wish they woulda done more with the coast and underwater aspects of the game, was really hoping we had some giant sea monsters of some kind, besides giant mirelurks,.
                        If you look at one of my other comments, you’ll see me defending the game overall. What Fo4 does well, it does *exceptionally* well; unfortunately, what it does poorly, it does exceptionally so as well. I happen to weight the qualities of a game in a way that’s favorable to Fo4, but I think all but the most disinterested players would be turned off by some of the weapons-grade bullshit that passes as plot in that game.
            Nah at 10 hours 1 second he talked to Preston again and got a settlement is asking for help
        They kind of lost the storyline directions after that point. The game is fun to play but its just not a good rpg. Great action fps tho.
            Shut up
        [deleted]
            Some fragile fans on the loose in here :D
Best of both worlds. I do the same with Battlefield 1 and 4.
They participated in a witch hunt when it first came out, mostly initiated by people who didn't even played Fallout before butbsuddenly were the biggest fans and had something to say about a franchise the didn't care about 10 minutes ago, and now they have to justify what they said. 

Things like "oh, yes, it's a good game, just not a good Fallout game" why? Because you don't want to die everytime a battle starts? Because it actually looks good? Because it's about saving a child and you don't care because you don't have children, so you can empathize with a super mutant that gone mad for being invisible too much but not with a mother or father looking for his child? Because the game offer you the option to build and you don't like it so now everything's bad? Or are the requisites to be a Fallout game written in a Bible only you have and Fo4 doesn't match them? 

It's the biggest, alivest, most beautiful, most repayable and most enjoyable Fallout game. It doesn't have the best main story IMO but it doesn't need it to be a good Fallout game. 

Sorry for the english, but if you didn't know Bethesda don't only translate the texts, they redo the voices in other languages too. It's a very big game and they still did it, that's very nice.
I actually kind of wish there had been no main story in Fallout 4 - I know, I know, before I get banned and tarred and feathered, hear me out! The basic core of the game, a vault of frozen prewar people trying to survive would have been awesome in and of itself. 

So, the reactor starts to fail, the people get woken up by fail safes. You all converge: "What's going on?! Oh no!" You get elected leader - either due to your military background or diplomatic/lawyer background. There are a lot of stories to be told in the local community - such as the drug lord who can become a potential bad guy. Anyway, everyone goes to the bunk room where they wait for you to "find out what is happening." You go secure Sanctuary Hills, and now have to make a decision - who will you ally with? Raiders, representing a chaotic evil kind of path? The Institute, as a neutral evil kind of path? The Minute Men as a good path? The Rail Road, as a neutral kind of path? The BOS, kind of neutral/kind of evil? No one? 

The game focuses on the settlement building as a story telling mechanism for the wasteland. The story is: "You lead a group of prewar survivors. It's 200 years later. You have Codsworth to fill you in. But how do you survive? How do you rebuild?
    I'd play that.
        So did a lot of people, it was called Fallout 76, just with less narrative.
            Why would you say something so controversial yet so brave?
            I was going to say that. Lol. But seriously, for all it's early faults, 76 does feel like Fallout now, sometimes more than FO4.
        Same
    Iirc there's a mod that does something like that. It basically overhauls the entire game.
        Any idea what it’s called
            I think they're talking about the Conquerer expansion for Sim Settlements.
            Horizon!
    You know what I'd be happy with no main quests in all of the fallout tgames. Just add more interesting side quests in their place and I'd prefer that
        This is actually a really good idea. Fallouts main quests are hit or miss. It's the side quests where the game really shines. It fits the world, too. You come out from under a rock to a broken world and have to carve out your own little slice.
            I remember a mod for fallout 3 that "removed" the main quest and spawned you somewhere random.
            Agreed, and this is pretty much the case with most Bethesda RPGs. I would gladly sacrifice Skyrim and Oblivion's main questline for more side quests, too.
                I'm going to have to seriously disagree with removing main quests from TES. Those are usually big events that put the fate of the world on the line.

Edit: Skyrim wouldn't be the same without dragons, or Oblivion without deadra.
                    Oh, I hear you. What I'm really saying is that imo, the main questline of most Bethesda RPGs post-Morrowind have been so-so from a gameplay perspective and from a story perspective. I don't think they're terrible or anything, but I think the side quests outshine them in a big way (and in a way that makes me feel more like a resident of the world than a convenient player-god). So that's what I mean when I say I'd trade those main quests for more side quests. I'm just saying, "I'll take less of that and more of that."
                Oblivion's main quest is honestly my favourite questline in Oblivion. TES Main Quests are a vital part of the games in my opinion, while in Fallout they aren't as important.
                    Yeah, definitely will have to agree to disagree on that one, then. I liked the ending to Oblivion's main quest, but not much else. The side quests on the other hand, were much better, in my opinion. The Thieves Guild, the Dark Brotherhood, etc.
    back when i was in like, 7th grade, my friends and i would usually spend most of class just fucking around with our school google accounts writing stories and shit instead of actually paying attention in class. when fallout 4 came out, me and a lot of my friends got into the fallout series because of it and it ended up fueling two google docs named "fallout 4 2" and "fallout new vegas 2" that were just comprised of us laying into both games at the same time with bulletpoint lists joking about what each game would be like if they had the game design of the other.

this was the very first bulletpoint in "fallout 4 2";

>Rather than the main story starting with a compelling reason to follow the main story, it starts with you coming to the commonwealth via speedboat. One of the other passengers is kellogg, who then punches you in the face and steals your prized sack of 1,000 caps. Getting your caps back and getting revenge on the man who punched you is your only motive for setting a mass war into motion.

6 years later, i think i honestly would be fully down for a fallout 4 with that plotline. lol
    That is one of my biggest issue with the game - that it tries to rely too much on the main story. In a un-Bethesda fashion it locks some parts of the game behind the main quest progression. The Institute and Brotherhood are both inaccessible without trying to find Shaun. While in Skyrim you can engage with most factions while not even becoming Dragonborn.

I'd be fine with the current story, as long as there was an alternative way to trigger the BoS arrival and finding the way into the Institute...
I always forget the lack of quality of life things in NV like sprinting because I always mod them in lol
This might be heresy but I think the story in 4 betters New Vegas in many ways. I like for the most part that 4 has a clear 'bad faction' to carry the first part of the main quest. Throughout the whole game the main antagonist is a clandestine organisation that appears almost omnipotent, yet when they finally truly reveal themselves there's an aspect to them many players may relate to and even find endearing. You're almost pushed to just explore for a period and their presence can be felt in most areas. After the reveal it becomes very clear how integrated they are into the whole wasteland and I genuinely found faction choosing more of a coincidence rather than an outright choice. 

In New Vegas, nearly all factions are a form of grey and it doesn't really suit to side with any of them by the time you reach the finale of the game. Many say it's good writing yet I feel it comes off cheap. The NCR are flawed, as is Caesars Legion. The Boomers, Kings, House and individual Casino's pose no real continuity for the strip. I always feel that going solo is the best for the wastland yet that route felt hollow to me. Even the legion which on the surface is a terrible entity becomes somewhat neutral when you realise that it's main rivals supports everything the legion does, just in a backseat way. It just all lacks focus. 

My main love for New Vegas lies with character interaction am individuals that fill the wasteland. No one in 4 really stands out yet New Vegas has many, whether it be the Van Graafs, the fella running out of Nipton, House, Boone... That is obsidian at their best for me. 

I think what's really great about Fallout is that every game in the series has it's perks. The first is an isometric forray into post nuclear war, the second just expands what the first one starts adding more depth. 3 goes into a whole new genre yet still captures the magic of what the first two has to offer. New Vegas expands the human beings which fill the wasteland and highlighting the plight which post-nuclear war possses. The 4th allows you the player to make your own bastion throughout the wasteland whilst showing how different factions form and coexist in a time where resources are scarce. There's almost a game for everyone in the series.
I really liked the enclave as the villain in 3 tho
The one thing I don’t think anyone will argue is how well Bethesda builds their maps. Even though 76 gets dragged through the mud(and much of the criticism is well deserved) the world they built is amazing, even better then 4 in my opinion.
    I think there's a '76 achievement on Xbox, "Walked in a straight line for 2 minutes without getting distracted.", 6% of players have this.
        Yeah, I gotta call a bit of BS on some of those percentages. 

Too many times I've done this silly or mundane thing in a game, got an achievement, and see only like 4-6% of others have gotten it.

And I mean, sure I'd buy it for something really abstract like jumping on a particular object or something, but for killing X amount of enemies on a map? Really?
            The ones that confuse me the most are like the one from 76 that's  just "leave the vault" and it's at like 76% 

Wtf are the other 24% of people doing?
                I mean considering it's 76 I can imagine many people turned it on immediately saw glitches and or bugs and just straight up never played again, but also yea 24% of the thousands playing it? Seems a bit much
    76 main failure is the lack of gameplay when exploring said world, a cool world is cool and all but when I have to fight the same enemies for the same reasons in every building it gets old fast
    "better then" :|
I remember TRYING Fallout 3 and New Vegas when I was younger (like 13-14) and not really being into them. I played Fallout 4 about a year after it came out because it was on sale and my brother recommended it. It was amazing! I still love it. Because of that experience, I tried 3 and NV again and holy. Shit.

New Vegas is God tier.
    I don't know why, but the guns in New Vegas always felt the best to me.  I'm doing 4 again right now and the guns are fun & varied, but they don't click with me the way New Vegas did.  It has been over a year since I last played New Vegas, and now I don't recall WHY New Vegas felt so much better.  But that's OK; it's an excuse to go back and play it again.
Really? I avoided playing it cuz people said it was bad and I couldn't get past the semi-turn based thing; would you recommend it then?
    I'd say Tactics is worth another go. You can toggle it to fully turnbased, but I honestly preferred it semi-turnbased as you could set your guys to automatically fire if they had x% chance to hit and the combat flowed so much smoother and faster. It's not among my favorite tactics games, those being new and old XCOM, Jagged Alliance 2 and Silent Storm series, but it has it's own charm and on the tier list of the genre, it's close to the top.
    Tactics,1, and 2 are all amazing. The majority of fallout fans just can’t see anything before 3
        Yeah I played 1 and 2 but couldn’t get into Tactics at all, it felt even more different
        3 isn't the first letter on the keyboard?
        I've tried playing the original two (I actually have them on disk from way back when I had my first PC), just couldn't get on with them at all. Gameplay bored the shit outta me.
    As a Fallout game, it's not great; but as a tactical squad game, it's actually really good, and the Fallout flavour is a nice bonus.
that's probably the least popular take I've seen so far!
It's pretty old,  i feel like it's hard to get into when you're coming from f4 , which is totally streamlined and gorgeous. 

I have that issue with f2 and f1 i just can't get into them, despite how good they are.
    Have you gotten past the tutorial for Fallout 2? That's easily the worst and hardest part. If you have and can't get into it, I get it, but if you haven't I'd suggest just following a guide for the opening.
        I'll do that,  because i haven't gotten past that, yet. Thank you!
I’ve had a similar experience
I think it depends on why you want to play. I'm playing Skyrim again, after having not played it for years, simply so that I can trundle about and explore the world, which is rich and fascinating and full of texture, both in terms of the people and the environment. Oh, and there's some sort of story there; I'll get around to doing something about it sometime, maybe, or maybe I'll just abandon the game once I've done the interesting stuff.

I started playing Fallout 3 when it was mentioned on an archaeology podcast and loved it for the same reason. FO4 could have done with a bit more in the way of people and side quests, but the environment was wonderful. Even without the people, I enjoyed exploring FO76, a landscape that I can almost smell.

And then there's NV. I've played it a few times and it's good. Very good. I'm told it's very good. But the rails get to me, as do the lack of small details. The factions seem flat and one-dimensional and I think part of it is that part of it is that everything is feeding into this grand narrative that you can't avoid. There's no real dirt: stuff that's just there because it's there because it's there, rounding out the nature of the place. This is somewhat unfair to NV, which has a number of side-quests and stories like Come Fly With Me. But it's an overwhelming impression and the thing that always makes me think, "some other time."  I think the same of FO2 and Outer Worlds, so there's something about the style that just doesn't gel with me. Whatever it is is not what appeals to me when I'm looking for something to do.
I had the same issue, my Beth game experience being Morrowind, Skyrim, FO4, then New Vegas. It was a jarring step back in terms of playability, even though the story was way better.
Why heresy? 3 isn't all that special tbh
    Lots of people really love 3 and find it to be the gold standard, either that or NV
    I think 3 was great for it's time. But after 4 released there's pretty no reason to play 3 excluding nostalgia.
        Because 3 is still a great game? Do you stop playing an old game when the sequel gets released? Yeah 4 may be better than 3, but 3 is still really fun to play. I don't play it just for nostalgia, I play it because it was a good game.
        I mean I don't think that's entirely fair. Personally I hate fallout 4's story it just didn't connect for me and there is just something special about roaming a ruined DC.

            Was searching for this
It’s not wrong tho.
I thought it was "It's a good game, just not a good Fallout".
[deleted]
    Yeah. Dark Souls 2 was a terrible Fallout game.
        It wasn't a half bad Mario Kart game though, if you think about it
    what makes dks2 not a souls game? ive played them all and while i think it has the worst PVE, its still a souls game.
        I think those people didn't like the quantity over quality approach to the Souls 2 bosses. I haven't touched it in a while but it had 40(?) bosses in the base game and quite a few of them were very easy, compared to ~20 in both Dks1 and dks3.

Regardless, I agree. It's a dark souls game if it has 'Dark Souls' in the title. It might need improvement but it's a solid entry nonetheless.
    How is it a good RPG? I am genuinely asking because I have never been able to role play in this game(Vanilla).
That’s because everyone makes the decision to board the hype train every single time and get let down when reality kicks in and the game isn’t what they thought. The crowds move on and the dedicated fans stay, and they are the ones praising it years later.
    Agree. The Witcher 3 was buggy at release but today it is considered as one of best games of the modern era.

~~Cyberjunk~~ Cyberpunk 2077 will be praised eventually once they ironed out the bugs at release tons of free dlc but expect loss of support on xbox 1 and ps4. The game was designed for pc in mind so even the equivalent pc of console specs ran better off than consoles.
        Cyberpunk not so much. That game has more issues beyond just being misunderstood. The fact the game is borderline unplayable for over half it's userbase to this day is not a good sign.
            3 years in the future when everyone has a next gen console its going to be fine to think it was good, instead of the mess that it is on ps4 and xbox one
            Yeah, it's still not on PlayStation store, right?  I'm kinda using that as a bellwether.  When/if PlayStation store allows it back in, I'll consider it "OK" enough to play.  Until then, I'm just waiting on patch after patch.
            Still waiting for it to be fixed enough to do a first time playthrough, and it looks like I'll be waiting for a good while.
        Cyberpink will never get this treatment for sure.

Bugs, bad performance (even on PC on new RTX3000's), inherently boring gameplay, bad written story, physics worse that fucking Goat Simulator...

Sorry, that game can't be saved. It has literally no point where it is "okay". It's lacking in every department where a game can lack in. It's not even that the players didn't get what was promised. They got literal garbage.

Even No Man's Sky had at least the procedural generation, which gave it some uniqueness.
        I don't know about Cyberpunk. Bethesda games are completed games that aren't ironed out at all, but Cyberpunk was an uncompleted game that was rushed to release. Unless they're willing to totally revamp the game and either eliminate the leftovers or implement them (like making lethal vs non-lethal matter, as an easy example,) I don't think it will be propped up any more than a solid GTA clone with potential. 

But what we've got now is basically a template for the type of GTA/RPG mashup that a lot of gamers want to see, someone just needs to make it. And that race is different than the solo one that CDPR was running before.
            I really enjoyed Cyberpunk. Sure it had its bugs but the game is really fun to me.
                It was good but still nothing that special (besides story and music) even disregarding bugs, which is not easy.
                    >still nothing that special (besides story and music) even disregarding bugs

So, the Witcher 3.
                        Kinda. Witcher 3 was much better though. Cyberpunk’s gameplay is good, both have great stories with high quality voice acting and the open world is amazing in both of them. (but there is not much side activities in them.) but Witcher 3 is the superior game overall if that makes sense.
                Oh me too, I think it's a solid game. I just don't think it's anything that is going to improve significantly as time goes on, we've got what we've got.
            The game won't get a revamp and doesn't need it. It needs fixing. It does what it does pretty well. 

For the people who want a gta in the future they have to look elsewhere.
                What I'm saying is that it already is GTA in the future. What it's not is a groundbreaking immersive RPG like the one that was promised.
                    Apart from an open world and cars it has really not much in common with GTA.
                        You mean aside from the base format of the the game world it's not like GTA? Seriously, this isn't criticism or even really insight, it's just the genre. Cyberpunk is *absolutely* an open world, semi-linear sandbox story game, like GTA. If someone said they wanted GTA in the future I would have no qualms about recommending Cyberpunk, it would probably be the closest I could think of. Maybe Saints Row IV, but that's a different kind of sci-fi.
                            One is an open world action adventure the other an open world rpg. Like I said they share the characteristics of an open world in which you can drive cars, other than that not much.
                                Don't know why you're being downvoted. GTA doesn't have dialogue choices, levels, perk choices, builds, and various endings. People just see surface level these days and it makes discussion impossible if you want to add nuance.
            It was incomplete because of incompetent management while covid 19 forced developers to work at home. They didn't create a development pipeline for everyone to work toward; each developer was largely left to their own devices instead of being able to contribute to the overall team effort, which lead to a lot of the problems the game has today. There's plenty out there to read about it.
        Yeah no, it's only a matter of time until CDPR abandon that game entirely.
        This is like my friend with 76, bugs were one issue, but not the whole issue, a lot of 76's, Skyrim's, FO4's bugs have been fixed, but, in my eyes, they are still all unplayable.
    I loved Fallout 4 at first and now I dont wanna touch it
76 got some good words lately as well
    I've played since wastelanders dropped when it started getting praise. Its a fun, basebuilding, exploration game with a huge detailed world to muck around in. If you've played and love 4 you'll love 76.
        Does F76 run better now? I'm kinda on the fence about picking it up (Im playing alone as well), but despite me having really good internet and hardware, I had weird hit detection and lags in the beta and on free weekends (like shooting at ghouls, but getting the hit marker 0.5sec later and laggy VATS, so not enough to make it unplayable, but pretty annoying)
            The gameplay can definitely still be pretty unresponsive, it's not great, but better than it was, coming from an avid 76 player. The latency varies quite a bit from server to server and how long the instance has been running/how much load is on the server at the time. Private runs very smooth, close to fo4 +whatever server latency there is.
        I'd try it if it wasn't multiplayer, but since it is I'll stay away.

Has nothing to do with the quality of the rest of the game, I'm just absolutely not interested in a Mp-Fallout and the differences that brings with it.
            It has pros and cons. I thought the same thing but then I started to do the events and daily quests. Having constant events and seasons makes it feel way more alive. I still play it like a single player fallout but now I can enjoy the new eve TS that happen like the mole miner treasure hunters that's happening now.
        >If you've played and love 4 you'll love 76.

I was expecting that, but nope.

76 took the things I loved most in Fallout 4 - exploring/hunting for junk, and digging up stories, and made me hate them.

I've got too many gripes with FO76, and no hope that they'll address any of them. I didn't care about the lack of NPCs, I just didn't want the game to feel like a chore, like work. But it did. And the updates they introduced only made it worse.
    I just wish it wasn't multiplayer. I know this isn't how most people play, but I like to play RPGs as a pack rat that picks up every single item. Being able to mod carry weight is a requirement for that.
        You CAN solo it now, but you have to have the monthly subscription to have private servers. I just started playing through it that way and so far it pretty much just feels like another fallout game. Not being able to pause sucks, but I'm having fun.
    But people should never forget that the game was designed as a crash grab for Bethesda since they seemed to be immune to any kind of criticism.

They didn't fix any bugs or Quality of Life changes people complain about since fallout 3, had barely any content or endgame, all Multiplayer components were buggy

And the game is pay to play, has a subscription model and an ingame shop and a season pass. 

So people keep in mind if you want to support this game and encourage Bethesda to keep doing this kind of work.
        I've been playing since launch. Never given them a penny. Literally - I bought the disc on eBay. Second character's about to hit level 200. There's plenty to do.
            At launch there was barely any endgame. Sure they fixed it with updates, but even with these updates they introduced daily or weekly limited resources like some mobile game
                Isn’t there being no endgame kind of the point in a continuously, dynamically evolving online game like F76?
        I'd never get any game the requires a season fucking pass, that's so ridiculous


Season these nuts Bethesda
            76 doesn't require a season pass. 

You get it for free?
                Nah it's 12 bucks a month if you want anything more than a bare bones grinding experience.
                    No its not? I bought it once and have gotten stuff from the season pass, like the clothing, power armor ect.
                        [I'm talking about this](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/10/23/fallout-76-now-has-a-premium-monthly-subscription-fee-no-seriously/)
                            Yeah they changed it a but from when this article was written 2 years ago. 

Currently it gives; Private servers, a scrap box, survival tent, monthly atoms, the ranger armor, and icons/emotes.
                                It's not "required" but it's heavily implied those who don't use it are at a disadvantage to those who do. In an online game that can become rather unpleasant with griefers and stuff. And the only way to avoid them is the monthly subscription.
            Would you support season passes such as COD MW where everything on the season pass is only cosmetic based or blueprints but anything like new guns is free 

Not really pay to play, more like pay to flex
                It is a slippery slope, that EA comment on here that was downvoted to shit is a good example of why.



Personally, I will put a game down for long periods of time and might not pick it up at all ever again. Spending money on cosmetic stuff like that and investing into it stresses me out more than I enjoy it because I feel inclined to play it over others. When I unlock stuff organically I don't have that issue.


And at the end of the day they're all obvious cash grabs. New content in games I think should be the most part free, or able to unlock through playing. It's definitely better for the gaming community itself.
Some of us actually enjoy the games for what they are from the beginning.  We don't get over-hyped, we take in what they offer, and we find what we like or don't like.  I've never dumped on any of the Fallout games in the whole "Fallout X is the best game, Fallout Y is absolute garbage"-type arguments, or bought into the whole Bethesda vs. Black Isle/Obsidian views, and to be honest, I really don't understand the point arguing about of any them.  Each game has its own strengths and weaknesses; there are places where each of the games absolutely excel, and there are places where they just don't work (sorry, Todd).

And, as always, time softens everything.  As people play the games, many of them forget the bad and remember the good.  It's how the human brain operates.  Fallout is far from the only example there as well.
    Enjoying games for what they are is the motto I live by. It's how I've managed to love every single game I've ever played, and love every movie I've ever watched (for the most part).
Heck even fallout 2 was a complete disaster at launch, it literally took 15-20 min to save or load your game.
    Thats weird, i didnt have this issue with fallout 2
Jokes on you, I liked Fallout 4 from the start
Its more the fact that new people come into the series, and older fans leave.
I still think 4 it's a huge downgrade, too streamlined, too casual, less bleak and more happy post apocalyptic theme park for all families and children, the gameplay felt like a skyrim mod tbh
Ha not playing at release gang
Nah 3 has always been ass and always will be to me. Dont know why people like it so much.
Imagine thinking that a Fallout subreddit with a few thousand users is indicative of what the general gaming population thinks about Fallout. You'll see the same cycle of opinions because subreddits are just echo chambers of the same opinions. Break out of your little bubble and you'll see most people still rank NV way above 4 and 3. Hell even mainstream journalism has caught up, you won't find a single publication that ranked 4 above Skyrim or New Vegas in a "Best of 2010's" list.
This is definitely happening with 76 too. It currently feels more like fallout than fallout 4 did.
Online communities are made of multiple people. Over time people come in and out of it, or change their minds within.
I never had bad problems with 3, NV, or 4 on release. I played all 3 the days they came out and 4 was the buggiest by far on release, but still was completely playable. Hell I still play all of them, so no, not everyone boards the hate train like you say we do, I’ve never shit on any game just because someone says it’s shit, I play and form my own opinion just like most of the people in this thread. I love all the fallout games and yes, even 76 (which is my least favorite though, fallout shouldn’t be multiplayer) I fell in love with the fallout series because they are huge open world rpg single player games and Bethesda better go back to that with the next fallout.
Having a better gameplay than Fallout 1, 2, 3 and NV isn't exactly a challenge. The combat in these games suck.
    And the AI if we're being honest. With high enough Stealth anyone can pick off raiders one by one, in front of their friends, and they'll just go back to whatever they were doing like they didn't just see Jerry's head explode in slow-mo.
        See, this issue you're describing is the kind of thing I hope they fix in the next Fallout and next Elder Scrolls game.  I want the next generation of these games to be more realistic in the NPC programming, but I fear that what we're going to get is just "bigger more."

There was an interview with Todd about the sequel to Skyrim, and he said something like, "If people enjoyed Skyrim for years, then I want the next one to be something they enjoy for decades," and I just wanted to barf.  I don't want a game that is so damn massive that I won't complete it before I die.  But I *do* want a game that is more immersive, more "real" feeling, and that requires only 3 things: better writing, better graphics, and better AI.

And I don't need MUCH better graphics.  If I'm happy with Skyrim in 2021, then *whatever* they have in the coming years will obviously supplant that.  And I don't even need much better AI.  I just need *some* more depth.  Can they just erect barricades when they see/hear their buddies getting stomped?  Can they close a door and ready to ambush me when I burst through?  Can they relocate to another building or higher ground?  Can they fall back and ally with another group so that they have strength in numbers?  Can they raise a flag of surrender and hope I spare their lives?

I've done programming most of my life.  I can imagine creating some modules for this kind of responsiveness.  The real question is: how much can they cram in, and are they even being asked to do it?  From what Todd said, he's creating a very massive game world that is incredibly shallow.  But I'm going to cross my fingers and hope for more.
            I think the biggest problem with the AI is that it was never designed with ranged combat in mind.

"Creation" is just a highly modified Gamebryo, and that was meant for sword fights.

Yes, the AI could still use better tactics and behaviors, but the biggest issue is it doesn't know how to treat an attack if it isn't a full on melee fight, because the second you crouch from a far enough distance the AI loses you and reverts to standby.
I actually liked the main quest more then 3's, but I think that's mostly due to so many people comparing me to my dad, having their favorite topic be my dad, me asking about my dad, and generally feeling like my dad was a holy figure.

People will say that there's no urgency to find your son in fo4, which I agree you forget about your son a lot, but that allowed for the other characters and conflicts going on to take more precedence.
You joke, but Bethesda, like most companies, has a team of fluffers that do nothing but post this kind of shit all over the Internet. Opinions are easily swayed over time because everyone's glued to their screens.

Fallout 4 is not any better or worse than it was when it was released. It's graphically pretty, has better gunplay but it has a shit story and is a shit RPG because they made bad decisions and spent too much time on settlements. 

But these posts will keep coming, just like the 76 posts.
    I would really interested to see any kind of proof that any company practices this.
    I would argue that it is better than when it released because of survival mode. That added so much replayability to the game.
    there are a ton of people who actually like FO4 its been my fav since launch personally. I personally think its a good RPG not storywise but gameplay wise. The skills and synergies are better than older fallouts IMO and i feel like I can customize my character way more in 4 than in older Fallouts through gameplay not story. People liked it since day 1 its just the giant circle jerk of hate in the beginning drowned out the people who did.
        Same with Cyberpunk. I avoided all media on purpose, until spent 100 hours in the game. Had exactly 3 bugs/glitches. Before patches.

Console launch was terrible and there is no denying that there were bugs. But the overall experience I personally had was amazing.
            Respect i disliked Cyberpunk but i can see why people did like it. Personally I got a few game breaking bugs but if ya didnt get any of those I imagine it was pretty fun!
                Story and side missions made this game enjoyable for me. You can watch it as a movie.

I played on normal difficulty, but once I got some perks in to handheld guns combat became extremely easy, instakilling everyone. That helped with the "movie" like gameplay.

I will replay it again in a year or two. I hope I will have for a challenge then.
        I like Fallout 4 just fine. I made a whole thread about [modding it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/7fpf28/how_i_learned_to_love_fallout_4_by_modding_it_to/) so I could like it more.

However, it is not any better now than it ever was. It's a middling Fallout game, as Fallout games go.

>The skills and synergies are better than older fallouts IMO 

Yeah, you're probably going to have to stand alone on that one, sorry. :)
            It is definitely not better now than ever. But like you said circlejerks are powerful and people were attacked for just saying anything positive on launch just cause it it wasnt New Vegas 2 story wise. Now that the hate has calmed down peeps now talk about it more positively. Its definitely not a bot squad by Bethesda to support a 6 year old game that they dont support anymore.

And I definitely am not alone the old skill systems are kinda dated (literally a board game system) and there are a lot of just useless stats (Ex. Charisma in New Vegas). I start differently in New Vegas but then always nearly max everything by the end. You can make way more diverse builds in FO4 with the insane amount of toys they give you.
What's different between  the old FNV circlejerk and the new FO4 circlejerk?
    The “old” FNV circlejerk is constantly ongoing. Constantly overlooking flaws. Constantly criticizing other games in the series for those same flaws and then making excuses for NV.

Most of this rehab of 4’s image comes with acknowledging and accepting 4’s flaws and jumping off the hate bandwagon towards it and enjoying it for what it is.

To answer your question, it’s night and day.
i disagree partially. a lot of people who are fans of fallout didn't like fallout 4 not because it wasn't fnv2, but because it strayed so far from the original tone and themes of the three fallout games written by black isle/obsidian. i enjoyed fallout 4 as a game but i believe it provided no profound commentary on the messages of its predecessors. it effectively said nothing while being incredibly polarizing, and while they could have tied that back into a lesson for the player as a sort of meta thing, they didn't. for that, i was really disappointed and it's why i say fallout 4 is a bad fallout game because i really value the perspective and writing of the games before it.
Yeah why would people expect a sequel in a franchise they love, dumb New Vegas fanboys, eat looter shooter shit.
While I personally think FO4 is the best of the series so far, the D.C. subway tunnels will always have a place in my heart. FO3 nailed that balance between an action RPG on the surface and a survival horror game underground, IMO.
Wdym there’s a ton more songs than fo3 or new Vegas.
Which isn't exactly difficult. The main story of FO3 sucked.
    I kind of agree and yet many see it as a far superior narrative experience to 4. 4’s story at least created a lot more debate in the community than 3 with its choices in faction endings.
        The main story of FO3 was pretty bad. FO4' main quest was meh, but its main issue was the side quests, the absurd majority of them are just "go there and kill all enemies".

FO4's "dungeons" are all corridors, which also sucked. In FO3 I had a lot of fun playing as a stealth sniper going through alternate paths to sneak upon my enemies. In FO4 you don't get that option because you just go through corridors, even if you invest in stealth, lockpick, hacking and everything else.
            I agree there were too many “go there and kill everyone” quests in 4.
            I do agree with the basic side quests but you can 100% do a stealth sniper. Most of my playthroughs are a variation of stealth and it may be annoying early game but late game you can go through almost the whole game wiping entire dungeons without being seen by anyone.
                Yeah, but while walking in a corridor. There isn't the part of exploring and finding alternate ways to avoid defenses.
"Family member leaves Vault to find other Family member, gets involved with Brotherhood of Steel and fights a technologically superior enemy for the fate of the wasteland"

You mean that story?
    You can finish the entirety of Fallout 4 without talking to any single member of the brotherhood of steel
        Missing my point, it's pretty much the same story as 3. The major plot points are there, and kinds shows for all the time they spent improving the game's mechanics that they kinda phoned in the story, but you're a mindless fanboy who can't take any criticism, of something they did not make no less, and will just angrily downvote my reply.

Maybe leave an angry message accusing me of being an idiot/hater or combination thereof.
            I downvoted you because what you said was low effort bait lol. Your comment drips with irony, accusing me of being angry or missing the point lmao. I don’t care what you think about Fallout 4; you’re the one who missed the point lol. 

At no point did I say the parallels between 3 and 4’s story weren’t strong, or that 4 reached the storytelling heights the story reached in the past with New Vegas. Nor did I say 4’s story was it’s strongest asset. 

I just said it’s story was better than 3’s. And I stand by that. You inferred everything else. Honestly you should’ve expected a low-effort rebuttal with how low effort your original attempt to bait a response out of me was lol. Have a good one now
                Sorry, I simply don't take anyone serious with more than one "lol" in a paragraph. 

Have fun maturing, kiddo.

Edit: for historical context, the first paragraph had 4 "lols" before they edited it. They removed one, and turned the other into a "lmao".
                    Man next time just save yourself the time and write “I give up” or don’t write anything at all
There are still unique weapons in F4, combat is better than all other Fallout games. I like the style of the game, easily the best one. Not sure what's lazy about the weapon upgrade system. The skills, karma and factions are big agrees though, loved those parts of the previous games..
    Theres tons of different upgrades but they don't really change much. Its 3 different tiers of upgrades. Each tier has the same upgrades just better stats. Ones higher damage, ones higher rate of fire etc. The next tier is just higher damage and higher rate of fire.
        No offense, but sounds like you never really bothered to learn about the weapon upgrade system, beyond “hardened>powerful>advanced aaand I’m done”. It’s true that there are straight upgrades within certain categories like semi automatic or automatic, but these are mostly for receivers. Outside of that you have flamethrower attachments for plasma weapons, scattergun conversions for laser weapons, a variety of sights and scopes to customize the effective range and VATS effectiveness, even conversions to different ammo types. On top of that, you have the constant interplay between damage and weight (and therefore AP drain in VATS). The system isn’t perfect for sure, but it’s far from lazy and is actively encourages people to interact with the best part of the game, the exploration.
            Yeah there were a lot of upgrades, but for the most part there were clear best ones. The energy weapons were definitely better., but they just used it as an excuse for removing a bunch of weapons, lmg, tribeam, plasma thrower, plasma defender, etc. They had some unique upgrades, but stats wise most of them just were not as viable, considering the enemies were leveled, unlike previous games (sorta).
Power armour was an excellent idea executed poorly, any of the mods that revamp it make it so much better, imo it stinks of execs being like no this is cool we want it to be available immediately to players not unlocked as you carry on
    How do mods rework it? Make it so you get your first fusion core after the  first one way later?
        I forget the name, but I seems to recall a mod that replaced the armor in Concord with a shitty Raider one, which made sense, and made Cores/Frames harder to come by... or that may have been two mods.
Facts
A perfectly valid criticism downvoted. These reasons are pretty much why I never finished 4 despite all the shiny stuff in it
    As a standalone game its pretty solid, but with multiple previous games it had a lot to live up to.
Based.
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/48078 I can personally confirm that this works
It kills me when people say, "You can just download a mod to make the dialogue like the old games!"

Yeah, that doesn't fix the dog shit writing, though. FO4 is seriously devoid of interesting quests and characters compared to any Fallout game before it.
    Yeah dialogue in general wasnt its highlight
Outside of the extreme haters, I don't think people claimed that Fallout 4 wasn't enjoyable. Fact is that it was a pretty good game all things considered. Problem is, the franchise, and Bethesda's track record called for more than just good.

&#x200B;

Fallout 1 and 2 are two of the pillars of the CRPG era in the mid 90s to the early 2000s. Morrowind is considered one of the greatest open world games ever, Skyrim was a global phenomenon when it dropped, and Fallout 3 was revered when it came out even if it didn't age well, while NV is considered one of the best RPGs of it's generation.

&#x200B;

Like it or not, that's the standard. If it was made by someone else under a different name, it would be talked about much more positively, but it wasn't. They have to be able to manage the expectations they've brought onto themselves from a multitude of fan bases. They don't have to appeal to all the different crowds, but they have to stick to something and execute it to live up to that level.
It’s not just as good, 4’s story is so bland and forgettable. I don’t care about looking for a kid I have no emotional attachment to
    Kid? Who are you kidding? Anyone with half a brain could've figured out that the kid will turn out to be an adult based on 2 simple facts.

1. You get refrozen for an undetermined amount of time after your wife dies.

2. Bethesda is too fucking lazy to make a novel and engaging feature like parenting a child into adult hood. They would never spend a single second developing an engaging way of caring for an actual child in the Wasteland. If you simply remember that Bethesda takes every possible shortcut, then it's easy to guess the big "reveal". I was more surprised that I originally came across the child Shawn and could not believe Bethesda actually did their best there. And then nope, utter disappointment.
Send him off to slime town
You and a million others
OP’s not condemning the devs, they’re just pointing out that one game has more detail than the other.
    Yeah, and why do you think that is!

Maybe because one game had 4 times the amount of time put unto it. That's what I'm trying to say, 

You grab a game that was rushed out in 18 months, play it, then go to a game that had 84 months of development time put into it and you make a post on reddit "WOW THIS IS SO DETAILED". Bruh, of course it is.
        The point is you’re railing against a criticism that doesn’t exist. OP’s not saying there’s no good reason for there being less detail, just that when you compare the games FO4 has more. The comparison doesn’t have to be ‘fair’.
            It does have to be fair, because otherwise it's invalid
                For critiquing the performance of the developers - yes

For describing the contents and merits of the game - no

OP was going the latter and not the former.
Since you mentioned mods.

You can transfer saves from the VR game and non VR game.

You can mod the DLC into VR. Which literally makes the game fucking epic in VR.
SkyrimVR is the best open world VR game!
    Have you tried Morrowind VR? It's quite good as well. 

I go between FO4VR, SkyrimVR and OpenMWVR basically as I sold my soul to Bethesda recently it appears...
        Same here. Cannot wait for SkyOblivion to launch so I can play Oblivion in SkyrimVR with all the VR enhancement mods.
            There was some talk about SkyWind a few years ago, but I wasn't good enough at English to comprehend completely what was being said.

 Now you mention Skyblivion, may I ask you if you know something about it?
                Basically the same thing as Skywind, Oblivion rebuilt on Skyrim's engine.
                    Thats awesome ill actually be able yo play morrowind now. I couldn’t get over the awful combat.
As much shit as Fallout VR got at launch, I have to second this and say it is my favorite VR experience I have had to date. I've played 20 hours and barely made it through 3 quests because I keep getting sidetracked exploring.

Also in VR, Fallout really makes you want to take it slow. I almost never use my run or even walk full speed outside of combat. It just feels so much better and more immersive to walk at a realistic pace, which makes everything take loads more time but I'm okay with that because I am just so happy to feel like I am in that world.
I think fallout 4 VR would make me a very happy man but I can't justify that cost.
    I'm right there with you, bud. Oh well, guess I'd better go buy a lotto ticket.
    Yeah don’t spend the money unless there’s other vr games you wanna play
Survival fallout 4 improves the game 10×
    Really like the immersion of survival. Aside from the occasional death being so very much more frustrating
Yeah the big thing holding me back from loving Fo4 is lack of towns and questlines, so many places are just shooting galleries with a terminal to read. The best mod I have played is Tales from the Commonwealth by the guy that did Interesting NPCs for Skyrim, because it adds more quests and human interactions to some of these places that had no real point. Also adds some great new followers. I highly recommend Audrey the ghoul in the Third Rail.
    My favourite follower from Tales from the Commonwealth is Birdie! I love all the hilarious lines he has as commentary during the main story quests.
        He is great too. He was the first one I found, and we traveled together for a long time before I decided to look up where to find the others.
    I’m not sure if Bethesda for Fallout 4 tried their best with the writing, and it’s the best they can do, or if they didn’t try much at all. I’m not sure which would be worse.

I just wish they went in on either choice. Either get rid of traditional NPCs and make a more survival exploration focused game with significant additions to the gameplay, or make a game with a story that’s not garbage. Fallout 76 is the former, but without any of the additions.
        Mostly I think they ended up with quantity over quality in terms of content.  255 distinct quests, with a bunch of those repeatable/radiant. 17 permanent companions (if you count dogmeat and the random robots you can build).  Four main quest factions with distinct and overlapping quest lines.  It's... A lot.
Same! What I would have done differently, take the settlement locations and build 75% of them into functional towns with at least one named settler that acts as a leader... then split them up between all factions 

And create a civil war type quest line of claiming all the settlements for one faction.. but allowing you to do so through, combat, dialogue, sabotage, alliances, betrayal, etc.
    This along with some of the sim settlement features built  in would have been great. 

Also a proper raider faction from the beginning. When you first go to Bunker Hill you can claim to be a raider, and your character yells it in a very aggro way, making me think at one point you actually could be a raider during development.
        Nuka World is a thing, so I wouldn't be surprised if they had that storyline in progress, couldn't finish it in time so cut it. Then, they simply did their raider thing for Nuka World.
        Yeah with all the cut content it sure does sound like they wanted to let you go raider
    That would’ve been great. But Bethesda is lazy and stupid. I’ve been playing fallout 4 for several years now and not once have I managed to build in all of the settlement locations. Hell after a certain amount it becomes pointless. You end up having to help a settlement while you’re still building. I rarely go the Minuteman route anyway. The building aspect is fun but they overdid it. They should’ve at least added a couple more towns with some named people in them. They could’ve added towns to act as Railroad safehavens, they could’ve even added a few more small towns to walk through. In fallout NV every town had ppl in it. Not this one tho
        That’s right. The established settlements are barren, and have zero dimensional settlers that give you radiant quests.. it’s too empty
            Seriously, though. Would it really have been so difficult for them to add in some unique NPCs and questlines for each settlement? I'm sure there are mods that do it, so that's something... but it easily could have been done in the base game.
            Yeah they literally have the player building the entire world just so they didn’t have to actually put cities into the game. They should’ve put a different engine in it. This game probably couldn’t even support another city added. Simply walking around in town makes your screen go stupid
I was working on a Sunshine Tidings settlement, and paused mid-build because the weather in-game was clear and I had a gorgeous view where I could make out the Corvega plant and the skyline of downtown Boston.

This game can be ridiculously good-looking at the right moments.
    Especially if you add mods that make the lighting more realistic and add stars in the sky. I have a mod that makes the environment as dark at night as irl and also a mod that replaces the bland sky that with a more impressive night sky with many stars. Because after 200 years of no vehicles or many factories being used the sky should have a lot more stars than just a few specks.
I can still remember the excitement of not knowing wtf the institute was but hearing constant references to it, then travelling there myself..  that shit was thrilling. Having no idea what to expect and then being transported there and meeting Father..  I don't play fallout 4 for the plot but that was an aspect loved.
"Yeah they didn't do that good, but don't worry Bethesda we can't expect to be on the level of a studio that's been on the brink of bankruptcy its whole life."
Literally just about every single location you stumble across has something of interest for you to find. And not just basic obvious things, you are genuinely rewarded so much more for looking in nooks and crannies compared to almost any other game including the prior BGS titles.

Beyond generic loot and junk (actually useful for settlement building and weapon modding) the are countless areas that offer world building or lore good old fashioned easter eggs through prop displays. Like Skeletons in precarious situations both funny and sad, teddy bear or gnome displays, makeshift campsites or even settlements that you can poke around and learn about what happened there, references to pop culture or other games etc. etc. And that isn't even touching on actual collectables like Bobbleheads, magazines, figurines etc. Hell even the holotapes and logs you are poopooing are genuinely great sources of lore, world building, or just basic context about the area where you found them and can lead to further things to explore.
Lol downvoted for talking shit on a boring game, the state of this subreddit.
FO3, fair play. But NV? It's an empty desert mate, and feels like it.
Agreed. 👍
    My favorite reddit interaction so far was when I said something like "I don't like the new star wars movies but I have nothing against people who do" and then immediately got downvoted and called toxic.
        Good for you. They’re just butthurt that a shit ton of people hated the sequels and they’d rather blame it on toxicity instead of the issues in the movie
Ok but I will actually fight someone in a parking lot if they say Mass Effect 2 sucks
    I don't know about "sucks" but I'd say it's easily the weakest of the three. It massively scaled back nearly every mechanic compared to one - armor, weapons, weapon mods, abilities, etc. The only thing it really improved mechanically speaking is the shooting and cover systems. I never understood why it didn't get more flak for that especially when you consider that the follow up to Biowares other big RPG Dragon Age II did basically the same thing and people won't shut up about it.
        Well Mass Effect 2’s gameplay had something DA:II’s didn’t: it was actually fun. And while I love a good looter shooter, Mass Effect 1 was not one of them. I found the loot to become repetitive and boring about half way through the game. Everything felt like a slightly different version of what you had before. (I do love Mass Effect 1 though. The loot just isn’t one of the reasons I love it). 

As far as story/characters/world goes, Mass Effect 2 is  the best one by a mile imo. I love collecting this team of different, powerful people, getting to know them, and having it pay off (or not) in the final mission. And they kept all of the characters from ME:1 in in some way, so I didn’t miss any of them. ME:3 has the worst new characters imo, and I was never a huge fan of either Kaiden or Ashley. 

All in all I think they’re all great games though. Mass Effect 2 was just the one that hit me the hardest when I first played through them all in like 2013.
            I thought DA2 was plenty fun, just in a different way. More of an action game than a strategy one. I do agree with the loot complaint for ME1 - I think ME3 really struck the best balance between complexity and fun. I just never hear anyone mention just how dumbed down 2 is which is so weird to me.

The story was....eh. On a micro scale (quests and characters) it was fantastic, but the macro story was also really scaled down. You went from saving the Galaxy to just kinda trying to save a few colonies. The threat was scaled down from Galaxy ending reapers to these weird enigmatic bug dudes. The plot in general was literally just go get people until something happens. It just wasn't nearly as engaging or interesting overall, even if the individual stories and characters were great. That's another issue I've heard brought up with DA2 that never seems to be a problem with ME2 - people were constantly complaining about how scaled down the plot stakes were. I mean, don't get me wrong, I do like 2 but I always find myself just really wanting to hurry up and get to 3 when I play it. Even if the story is stronger in some ways, the gameplay is just so much more scaled back and disappointing.
    Mass Effect 2 sucks
        Aiight I’m outside Denny’s where ya at?!?
Gonna start a new account as “Buttlicker39”
    Go with my blessing
> To clarify, saying “think this game sucks” isn’t the same thing as shitting on a person for what they like.

Exactly.  I mean, even though I've written pages-long dissertations on FO4's many, _many_ failings, I still played the thing for hundreds of hours and made almost as many mods for it as I did for _Fallout New Vegas._  (Although the majority of them were of the failing-corrective nature.)
Well for those who don’t love it... no one is inviting you to share those opinions in a thread that is praising the thing you don’t like. It’s just as easy to keep your mouth shut.
    This is true, though one exception is called “Constructive Criticism”. If you're going to criticize something, then say why instead of just “This is poo-poo”.
        I hear what you’re saying but you can’t critique someone’s opinion. A critique occurs when a creator invites an audience to discuss their feelings regarding a thing the creator is presenting. Then the creator listens and takes it and says thanks. No debate. No differing opinions. Just a critique. This thread is not that. 

This thread is a celebration of a thing. An opinion someone has. Which one could be critical of but why? Why walk up to a group who is drinking beer just to say “I don’t like beer. I prefer wine.” What’s the point? To share how you feel? Why? 

My point is: If the OP or anyone who holds the game in high regard is expected to have enough self respect to not care when someone else dislikes the game then those who dislike it should also have enough self respect to not care when they see someone enjoying it.
            I 100% agree. Though this is something that can't be stopped. People will do it anyway.
            >	This thread is a celebration of a thing. An opinion someone has. Which one could be critical of but why? Why walk up to a group who is drinking beer just to say “I don’t like beer. I prefer wine.” What’s the point? To share how you feel? Why?

Sure in that situation it’s weird. But this isn’t a private conversation. **It’s a public forum** where anyone following the rules may participate in any discussion they wish. 

If you don’t want people to disagree with you then why did you come to the place specifically for discussion? 

If you want a place specifically for celebration then start a sub and ban anyone critical of the games. 

Anyone who comes to a public forum and thinks people with a different opinion should keep them to themselves is a hypocrite.
That is true, just pure science fiction goodness..
Only the first ten? If the first ten are perfect then the rest is too.
    At hour eleven he got to The Railroad and realized that something was not well in The Commonwealth.
        I will defend my honor as the best railroad heavy in the commonwealth good sir. ;) not everyone likes them thats okay. I came from the ballistic weave and stayed for the people.
            I really wish Glory could have been the railroad companion.
            I don’t have any sort of problem with the railroad as an entity; I sided with them too. The problem I have with the railroad is the same problem I have with *all* the factions in the game: they are terribly written. I think they’re all pretty equally bad though, and the only reason I pick on the railroad is that it’s maybe the earliest that you can realize just how horrendously stupid the story is.
                The writing was really my main gripe with F4. OP has some solid ground here imo, it is a fantastic game with hours upon hours of gameplay to offer to even the most picky of players. 

But I have a powerful bias for great writing, dialogue, and story-telling, and that’s F4s worst components. Also I wish they woulda done more with the coast and underwater aspects of the game, was really hoping we had some giant sea monsters of some kind, besides giant mirelurks,.
                    If you look at one of my other comments, you’ll see me defending the game overall. What Fo4 does well, it does *exceptionally* well; unfortunately, what it does poorly, it does exceptionally so as well. I happen to weight the qualities of a game in a way that’s favorable to Fo4, but I think all but the most disinterested players would be turned off by some of the weapons-grade bullshit that passes as plot in that game.
        Nah at 10 hours 1 second he talked to Preston again and got a settlement is asking for help
    They kind of lost the storyline directions after that point. The game is fun to play but its just not a good rpg. Great action fps tho.
        Shut up
    [deleted]
        Some fragile fans on the loose in here :D
I'd play that.
    So did a lot of people, it was called Fallout 76, just with less narrative.
        Why would you say something so controversial yet so brave?
        I was going to say that. Lol. But seriously, for all it's early faults, 76 does feel like Fallout now, sometimes more than FO4.
    Same
Iirc there's a mod that does something like that. It basically overhauls the entire game.
    Any idea what it’s called
        I think they're talking about the Conquerer expansion for Sim Settlements.
        Horizon!
You know what I'd be happy with no main quests in all of the fallout tgames. Just add more interesting side quests in their place and I'd prefer that
    This is actually a really good idea. Fallouts main quests are hit or miss. It's the side quests where the game really shines. It fits the world, too. You come out from under a rock to a broken world and have to carve out your own little slice.
        I remember a mod for fallout 3 that "removed" the main quest and spawned you somewhere random.
        Agreed, and this is pretty much the case with most Bethesda RPGs. I would gladly sacrifice Skyrim and Oblivion's main questline for more side quests, too.
            I'm going to have to seriously disagree with removing main quests from TES. Those are usually big events that put the fate of the world on the line.

Edit: Skyrim wouldn't be the same without dragons, or Oblivion without deadra.
                Oh, I hear you. What I'm really saying is that imo, the main questline of most Bethesda RPGs post-Morrowind have been so-so from a gameplay perspective and from a story perspective. I don't think they're terrible or anything, but I think the side quests outshine them in a big way (and in a way that makes me feel more like a resident of the world than a convenient player-god). So that's what I mean when I say I'd trade those main quests for more side quests. I'm just saying, "I'll take less of that and more of that."
            Oblivion's main quest is honestly my favourite questline in Oblivion. TES Main Quests are a vital part of the games in my opinion, while in Fallout they aren't as important.
                Yeah, definitely will have to agree to disagree on that one, then. I liked the ending to Oblivion's main quest, but not much else. The side quests on the other hand, were much better, in my opinion. The Thieves Guild, the Dark Brotherhood, etc.
back when i was in like, 7th grade, my friends and i would usually spend most of class just fucking around with our school google accounts writing stories and shit instead of actually paying attention in class. when fallout 4 came out, me and a lot of my friends got into the fallout series because of it and it ended up fueling two google docs named "fallout 4 2" and "fallout new vegas 2" that were just comprised of us laying into both games at the same time with bulletpoint lists joking about what each game would be like if they had the game design of the other.

this was the very first bulletpoint in "fallout 4 2";

>Rather than the main story starting with a compelling reason to follow the main story, it starts with you coming to the commonwealth via speedboat. One of the other passengers is kellogg, who then punches you in the face and steals your prized sack of 1,000 caps. Getting your caps back and getting revenge on the man who punched you is your only motive for setting a mass war into motion.

6 years later, i think i honestly would be fully down for a fallout 4 with that plotline. lol
That is one of my biggest issue with the game - that it tries to rely too much on the main story. In a un-Bethesda fashion it locks some parts of the game behind the main quest progression. The Institute and Brotherhood are both inaccessible without trying to find Shaun. While in Skyrim you can engage with most factions while not even becoming Dragonborn.

I'd be fine with the current story, as long as there was an alternative way to trigger the BoS arrival and finding the way into the Institute...
I think there's a '76 achievement on Xbox, "Walked in a straight line for 2 minutes without getting distracted.", 6% of players have this.
    Yeah, I gotta call a bit of BS on some of those percentages. 

Too many times I've done this silly or mundane thing in a game, got an achievement, and see only like 4-6% of others have gotten it.

And I mean, sure I'd buy it for something really abstract like jumping on a particular object or something, but for killing X amount of enemies on a map? Really?
        The ones that confuse me the most are like the one from 76 that's  just "leave the vault" and it's at like 76% 

Wtf are the other 24% of people doing?
            I mean considering it's 76 I can imagine many people turned it on immediately saw glitches and or bugs and just straight up never played again, but also yea 24% of the thousands playing it? Seems a bit much
76 main failure is the lack of gameplay when exploring said world, a cool world is cool and all but when I have to fight the same enemies for the same reasons in every building it gets old fast
"better then" :|
I don't know why, but the guns in New Vegas always felt the best to me.  I'm doing 4 again right now and the guns are fun & varied, but they don't click with me the way New Vegas did.  It has been over a year since I last played New Vegas, and now I don't recall WHY New Vegas felt so much better.  But that's OK; it's an excuse to go back and play it again.
I'd say Tactics is worth another go. You can toggle it to fully turnbased, but I honestly preferred it semi-turnbased as you could set your guys to automatically fire if they had x% chance to hit and the combat flowed so much smoother and faster. It's not among my favorite tactics games, those being new and old XCOM, Jagged Alliance 2 and Silent Storm series, but it has it's own charm and on the tier list of the genre, it's close to the top.
Tactics,1, and 2 are all amazing. The majority of fallout fans just can’t see anything before 3
    Yeah I played 1 and 2 but couldn’t get into Tactics at all, it felt even more different
    3 isn't the first letter on the keyboard?
    I've tried playing the original two (I actually have them on disk from way back when I had my first PC), just couldn't get on with them at all. Gameplay bored the shit outta me.
As a Fallout game, it's not great; but as a tactical squad game, it's actually really good, and the Fallout flavour is a nice bonus.
Have you gotten past the tutorial for Fallout 2? That's easily the worst and hardest part. If you have and can't get into it, I get it, but if you haven't I'd suggest just following a guide for the opening.
    I'll do that,  because i haven't gotten past that, yet. Thank you!
Lots of people really love 3 and find it to be the gold standard, either that or NV
I think 3 was great for it's time. But after 4 released there's pretty no reason to play 3 excluding nostalgia.
    Because 3 is still a great game? Do you stop playing an old game when the sequel gets released? Yeah 4 may be better than 3, but 3 is still really fun to play. I don't play it just for nostalgia, I play it because it was a good game.
    I mean I don't think that's entirely fair. Personally I hate fallout 4's story it just didn't connect for me and there is just something special about roaming a ruined DC.
    Liam Neeson.
        Was searching for this
Yeah. Dark Souls 2 was a terrible Fallout game.
    It wasn't a half bad Mario Kart game though, if you think about it
what makes dks2 not a souls game? ive played them all and while i think it has the worst PVE, its still a souls game.
    I think those people didn't like the quantity over quality approach to the Souls 2 bosses. I haven't touched it in a while but it had 40(?) bosses in the base game and quite a few of them were very easy, compared to ~20 in both Dks1 and dks3.

Regardless, I agree. It's a dark souls game if it has 'Dark Souls' in the title. It might need improvement but it's a solid entry nonetheless.
How is it a good RPG? I am genuinely asking because I have never been able to role play in this game(Vanilla).
Agree. The Witcher 3 was buggy at release but today it is considered as one of best games of the modern era.

~~Cyberjunk~~ Cyberpunk 2077 will be praised eventually once they ironed out the bugs at release tons of free dlc but expect loss of support on xbox 1 and ps4. The game was designed for pc in mind so even the equivalent pc of console specs ran better off than consoles.
    Cyberpunk not so much. That game has more issues beyond just being misunderstood. The fact the game is borderline unplayable for over half it's userbase to this day is not a good sign.
        3 years in the future when everyone has a next gen console its going to be fine to think it was good, instead of the mess that it is on ps4 and xbox one
        Yeah, it's still not on PlayStation store, right?  I'm kinda using that as a bellwether.  When/if PlayStation store allows it back in, I'll consider it "OK" enough to play.  Until then, I'm just waiting on patch after patch.
        Still waiting for it to be fixed enough to do a first time playthrough, and it looks like I'll be waiting for a good while.
    Cyberpink will never get this treatment for sure.

Bugs, bad performance (even on PC on new RTX3000's), inherently boring gameplay, bad written story, physics worse that fucking Goat Simulator...

Sorry, that game can't be saved. It has literally no point where it is "okay". It's lacking in every department where a game can lack in. It's not even that the players didn't get what was promised. They got literal garbage.

Even No Man's Sky had at least the procedural generation, which gave it some uniqueness.
    I don't know about Cyberpunk. Bethesda games are completed games that aren't ironed out at all, but Cyberpunk was an uncompleted game that was rushed to release. Unless they're willing to totally revamp the game and either eliminate the leftovers or implement them (like making lethal vs non-lethal matter, as an easy example,) I don't think it will be propped up any more than a solid GTA clone with potential. 

But what we've got now is basically a template for the type of GTA/RPG mashup that a lot of gamers want to see, someone just needs to make it. And that race is different than the solo one that CDPR was running before.
        I really enjoyed Cyberpunk. Sure it had its bugs but the game is really fun to me.
            It was good but still nothing that special (besides story and music) even disregarding bugs, which is not easy.
                >still nothing that special (besides story and music) even disregarding bugs

So, the Witcher 3.
                    Kinda. Witcher 3 was much better though. Cyberpunk’s gameplay is good, both have great stories with high quality voice acting and the open world is amazing in both of them. (but there is not much side activities in them.) but Witcher 3 is the superior game overall if that makes sense.
            Oh me too, I think it's a solid game. I just don't think it's anything that is going to improve significantly as time goes on, we've got what we've got.
        The game won't get a revamp and doesn't need it. It needs fixing. It does what it does pretty well. 

For the people who want a gta in the future they have to look elsewhere.
            What I'm saying is that it already is GTA in the future. What it's not is a groundbreaking immersive RPG like the one that was promised.
                Apart from an open world and cars it has really not much in common with GTA.
                    You mean aside from the base format of the the game world it's not like GTA? Seriously, this isn't criticism or even really insight, it's just the genre. Cyberpunk is *absolutely* an open world, semi-linear sandbox story game, like GTA. If someone said they wanted GTA in the future I would have no qualms about recommending Cyberpunk, it would probably be the closest I could think of. Maybe Saints Row IV, but that's a different kind of sci-fi.
                        One is an open world action adventure the other an open world rpg. Like I said they share the characteristics of an open world in which you can drive cars, other than that not much.
                            Don't know why you're being downvoted. GTA doesn't have dialogue choices, levels, perk choices, builds, and various endings. People just see surface level these days and it makes discussion impossible if you want to add nuance.
        It was incomplete because of incompetent management while covid 19 forced developers to work at home. They didn't create a development pipeline for everyone to work toward; each developer was largely left to their own devices instead of being able to contribute to the overall team effort, which lead to a lot of the problems the game has today. There's plenty out there to read about it.
    Yeah no, it's only a matter of time until CDPR abandon that game entirely.
    This is like my friend with 76, bugs were one issue, but not the whole issue, a lot of 76's, Skyrim's, FO4's bugs have been fixed, but, in my eyes, they are still all unplayable.
I loved Fallout 4 at first and now I dont wanna touch it
I've played since wastelanders dropped when it started getting praise. Its a fun, basebuilding, exploration game with a huge detailed world to muck around in. If you've played and love 4 you'll love 76.
    Does F76 run better now? I'm kinda on the fence about picking it up (Im playing alone as well), but despite me having really good internet and hardware, I had weird hit detection and lags in the beta and on free weekends (like shooting at ghouls, but getting the hit marker 0.5sec later and laggy VATS, so not enough to make it unplayable, but pretty annoying)
        The gameplay can definitely still be pretty unresponsive, it's not great, but better than it was, coming from an avid 76 player. The latency varies quite a bit from server to server and how long the instance has been running/how much load is on the server at the time. Private runs very smooth, close to fo4 +whatever server latency there is.
    I'd try it if it wasn't multiplayer, but since it is I'll stay away.

Has nothing to do with the quality of the rest of the game, I'm just absolutely not interested in a Mp-Fallout and the differences that brings with it.
        It has pros and cons. I thought the same thing but then I started to do the events and daily quests. Having constant events and seasons makes it feel way more alive. I still play it like a single player fallout but now I can enjoy the new eve TS that happen like the mole miner treasure hunters that's happening now.
    >If you've played and love 4 you'll love 76.

I was expecting that, but nope.

76 took the things I loved most in Fallout 4 - exploring/hunting for junk, and digging up stories, and made me hate them.

I've got too many gripes with FO76, and no hope that they'll address any of them. I didn't care about the lack of NPCs, I just didn't want the game to feel like a chore, like work. But it did. And the updates they introduced only made it worse.
I just wish it wasn't multiplayer. I know this isn't how most people play, but I like to play RPGs as a pack rat that picks up every single item. Being able to mod carry weight is a requirement for that.
    You CAN solo it now, but you have to have the monthly subscription to have private servers. I just started playing through it that way and so far it pretty much just feels like another fallout game. Not being able to pause sucks, but I'm having fun.
But people should never forget that the game was designed as a crash grab for Bethesda since they seemed to be immune to any kind of criticism.

They didn't fix any bugs or Quality of Life changes people complain about since fallout 3, had barely any content or endgame, all Multiplayer components were buggy

And the game is pay to play, has a subscription model and an ingame shop and a season pass. 

So people keep in mind if you want to support this game and encourage Bethesda to keep doing this kind of work.
    I've been playing since launch. Never given them a penny. Literally - I bought the disc on eBay. Second character's about to hit level 200. There's plenty to do.
        At launch there was barely any endgame. Sure they fixed it with updates, but even with these updates they introduced daily or weekly limited resources like some mobile game
            Isn’t there being no endgame kind of the point in a continuously, dynamically evolving online game like F76?
    I'd never get any game the requires a season fucking pass, that's so ridiculous


Season these nuts Bethesda
        76 doesn't require a season pass. 

You get it for free?
            Nah it's 12 bucks a month if you want anything more than a bare bones grinding experience.
                No its not? I bought it once and have gotten stuff from the season pass, like the clothing, power armor ect.
                    [I'm talking about this](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/10/23/fallout-76-now-has-a-premium-monthly-subscription-fee-no-seriously/)
                        Yeah they changed it a but from when this article was written 2 years ago. 

Currently it gives; Private servers, a scrap box, survival tent, monthly atoms, the ranger armor, and icons/emotes.
                            It's not "required" but it's heavily implied those who don't use it are at a disadvantage to those who do. In an online game that can become rather unpleasant with griefers and stuff. And the only way to avoid them is the monthly subscription.
        Would you support season passes such as COD MW where everything on the season pass is only cosmetic based or blueprints but anything like new guns is free 

Not really pay to play, more like pay to flex
            It is a slippery slope, that EA comment on here that was downvoted to shit is a good example of why.



Personally, I will put a game down for long periods of time and might not pick it up at all ever again. Spending money on cosmetic stuff like that and investing into it stresses me out more than I enjoy it because I feel inclined to play it over others. When I unlock stuff organically I don't have that issue.


And at the end of the day they're all obvious cash grabs. New content in games I think should be the most part free, or able to unlock through playing. It's definitely better for the gaming community itself.
Enjoying games for what they are is the motto I live by. It's how I've managed to love every single game I've ever played, and love every movie I've ever watched (for the most part).
Thats weird, i didnt have this issue with fallout 2
And the AI if we're being honest. With high enough Stealth anyone can pick off raiders one by one, in front of their friends, and they'll just go back to whatever they were doing like they didn't just see Jerry's head explode in slow-mo.
    See, this issue you're describing is the kind of thing I hope they fix in the next Fallout and next Elder Scrolls game.  I want the next generation of these games to be more realistic in the NPC programming, but I fear that what we're going to get is just "bigger more."

There was an interview with Todd about the sequel to Skyrim, and he said something like, "If people enjoyed Skyrim for years, then I want the next one to be something they enjoy for decades," and I just wanted to barf.  I don't want a game that is so damn massive that I won't complete it before I die.  But I *do* want a game that is more immersive, more "real" feeling, and that requires only 3 things: better writing, better graphics, and better AI.

And I don't need MUCH better graphics.  If I'm happy with Skyrim in 2021, then *whatever* they have in the coming years will obviously supplant that.  And I don't even need much better AI.  I just need *some* more depth.  Can they just erect barricades when they see/hear their buddies getting stomped?  Can they close a door and ready to ambush me when I burst through?  Can they relocate to another building or higher ground?  Can they fall back and ally with another group so that they have strength in numbers?  Can they raise a flag of surrender and hope I spare their lives?

I've done programming most of my life.  I can imagine creating some modules for this kind of responsiveness.  The real question is: how much can they cram in, and are they even being asked to do it?  From what Todd said, he's creating a very massive game world that is incredibly shallow.  But I'm going to cross my fingers and hope for more.
        I think the biggest problem with the AI is that it was never designed with ranged combat in mind.

"Creation" is just a highly modified Gamebryo, and that was meant for sword fights.

Yes, the AI could still use better tactics and behaviors, but the biggest issue is it doesn't know how to treat an attack if it isn't a full on melee fight, because the second you crouch from a far enough distance the AI loses you and reverts to standby.
I would really interested to see any kind of proof that any company practices this.
I would argue that it is better than when it released because of survival mode. That added so much replayability to the game.
there are a ton of people who actually like FO4 its been my fav since launch personally. I personally think its a good RPG not storywise but gameplay wise. The skills and synergies are better than older fallouts IMO and i feel like I can customize my character way more in 4 than in older Fallouts through gameplay not story. People liked it since day 1 its just the giant circle jerk of hate in the beginning drowned out the people who did.
    Same with Cyberpunk. I avoided all media on purpose, until spent 100 hours in the game. Had exactly 3 bugs/glitches. Before patches.

Console launch was terrible and there is no denying that there were bugs. But the overall experience I personally had was amazing.
        Respect i disliked Cyberpunk but i can see why people did like it. Personally I got a few game breaking bugs but if ya didnt get any of those I imagine it was pretty fun!
            Story and side missions made this game enjoyable for me. You can watch it as a movie.

I played on normal difficulty, but once I got some perks in to handheld guns combat became extremely easy, instakilling everyone. That helped with the "movie" like gameplay.

I will replay it again in a year or two. I hope I will have for a challenge then.
    I like Fallout 4 just fine. I made a whole thread about [modding it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/7fpf28/how_i_learned_to_love_fallout_4_by_modding_it_to/) so I could like it more.

However, it is not any better now than it ever was. It's a middling Fallout game, as Fallout games go.

>The skills and synergies are better than older fallouts IMO 

Yeah, you're probably going to have to stand alone on that one, sorry. :)
        It is definitely not better now than ever. But like you said circlejerks are powerful and people were attacked for just saying anything positive on launch just cause it it wasnt New Vegas 2 story wise. Now that the hate has calmed down peeps now talk about it more positively. Its definitely not a bot squad by Bethesda to support a 6 year old game that they dont support anymore.

And I definitely am not alone the old skill systems are kinda dated (literally a board game system) and there are a lot of just useless stats (Ex. Charisma in New Vegas). I start differently in New Vegas but then always nearly max everything by the end. You can make way more diverse builds in FO4 with the insane amount of toys they give you.
The “old” FNV circlejerk is constantly ongoing. Constantly overlooking flaws. Constantly criticizing other games in the series for those same flaws and then making excuses for NV.

Most of this rehab of 4’s image comes with acknowledging and accepting 4’s flaws and jumping off the hate bandwagon towards it and enjoying it for what it is.

To answer your question, it’s night and day.
I kind of agree and yet many see it as a far superior narrative experience to 4. 4’s story at least created a lot more debate in the community than 3 with its choices in faction endings.
    The main story of FO3 was pretty bad. FO4' main quest was meh, but its main issue was the side quests, the absurd majority of them are just "go there and kill all enemies".

FO4's "dungeons" are all corridors, which also sucked. In FO3 I had a lot of fun playing as a stealth sniper going through alternate paths to sneak upon my enemies. In FO4 you don't get that option because you just go through corridors, even if you invest in stealth, lockpick, hacking and everything else.
        I agree there were too many “go there and kill everyone” quests in 4.
        I do agree with the basic side quests but you can 100% do a stealth sniper. Most of my playthroughs are a variation of stealth and it may be annoying early game but late game you can go through almost the whole game wiping entire dungeons without being seen by anyone.
            Yeah, but while walking in a corridor. There isn't the part of exploring and finding alternate ways to avoid defenses.
You can finish the entirety of Fallout 4 without talking to any single member of the brotherhood of steel
    Missing my point, it's pretty much the same story as 3. The major plot points are there, and kinds shows for all the time they spent improving the game's mechanics that they kinda phoned in the story, but you're a mindless fanboy who can't take any criticism, of something they did not make no less, and will just angrily downvote my reply.

Maybe leave an angry message accusing me of being an idiot/hater or combination thereof.
        I downvoted you because what you said was low effort bait lol. Your comment drips with irony, accusing me of being angry or missing the point lmao. I don’t care what you think about Fallout 4; you’re the one who missed the point lol. 

At no point did I say the parallels between 3 and 4’s story weren’t strong, or that 4 reached the storytelling heights the story reached in the past with New Vegas. Nor did I say 4’s story was it’s strongest asset. 

I just said it’s story was better than 3’s. And I stand by that. You inferred everything else. Honestly you should’ve expected a low-effort rebuttal with how low effort your original attempt to bait a response out of me was lol. Have a good one now
            Sorry, I simply don't take anyone serious with more than one "lol" in a paragraph. 

Have fun maturing, kiddo.

Edit: for historical context, the first paragraph had 4 "lols" before they edited it. They removed one, and turned the other into a "lmao".
                Man next time just save yourself the time and write “I give up” or don’t write anything at all
Theres tons of different upgrades but they don't really change much. Its 3 different tiers of upgrades. Each tier has the same upgrades just better stats. Ones higher damage, ones higher rate of fire etc. The next tier is just higher damage and higher rate of fire.
    No offense, but sounds like you never really bothered to learn about the weapon upgrade system, beyond “hardened>powerful>advanced aaand I’m done”. It’s true that there are straight upgrades within certain categories like semi automatic or automatic, but these are mostly for receivers. Outside of that you have flamethrower attachments for plasma weapons, scattergun conversions for laser weapons, a variety of sights and scopes to customize the effective range and VATS effectiveness, even conversions to different ammo types. On top of that, you have the constant interplay between damage and weight (and therefore AP drain in VATS). The system isn’t perfect for sure, but it’s far from lazy and is actively encourages people to interact with the best part of the game, the exploration.
        Yeah there were a lot of upgrades, but for the most part there were clear best ones. The energy weapons were definitely better., but they just used it as an excuse for removing a bunch of weapons, lmg, tribeam, plasma thrower, plasma defender, etc. They had some unique upgrades, but stats wise most of them just were not as viable, considering the enemies were leveled, unlike previous games (sorta).
How do mods rework it? Make it so you get your first fusion core after the  first one way later?
    I forget the name, but I seems to recall a mod that replaced the armor in Concord with a shitty Raider one, which made sense, and made Cores/Frames harder to come by... or that may have been two mods.
As a standalone game its pretty solid, but with multiple previous games it had a lot to live up to.
Yeah dialogue in general wasnt its highlight
Kid? Who are you kidding? Anyone with half a brain could've figured out that the kid will turn out to be an adult based on 2 simple facts.

1. You get refrozen for an undetermined amount of time after your wife dies.

2. Bethesda is too fucking lazy to make a novel and engaging feature like parenting a child into adult hood. They would never spend a single second developing an engaging way of caring for an actual child in the Wasteland. If you simply remember that Bethesda takes every possible shortcut, then it's easy to guess the big "reveal". I was more surprised that I originally came across the child Shawn and could not believe Bethesda actually did their best there. And then nope, utter disappointment.
Yeah, and why do you think that is!

Maybe because one game had 4 times the amount of time put unto it. That's what I'm trying to say, 

You grab a game that was rushed out in 18 months, play it, then go to a game that had 84 months of development time put into it and you make a post on reddit "WOW THIS IS SO DETAILED". Bruh, of course it is.
    The point is you’re railing against a criticism that doesn’t exist. OP’s not saying there’s no good reason for there being less detail, just that when you compare the games FO4 has more. The comparison doesn’t have to be ‘fair’.
        It does have to be fair, because otherwise it's invalid
            For critiquing the performance of the developers - yes

For describing the contents and merits of the game - no

OP was going the latter and not the former.
Have you tried Morrowind VR? It's quite good as well. 

I go between FO4VR, SkyrimVR and OpenMWVR basically as I sold my soul to Bethesda recently it appears...
    Same here. Cannot wait for SkyOblivion to launch so I can play Oblivion in SkyrimVR with all the VR enhancement mods.
        There was some talk about SkyWind a few years ago, but I wasn't good enough at English to comprehend completely what was being said.

 Now you mention Skyblivion, may I ask you if you know something about it?
            Basically the same thing as Skywind, Oblivion rebuilt on Skyrim's engine.
                Thats awesome ill actually be able yo play morrowind now. I couldn’t get over the awful combat.
I'm right there with you, bud. Oh well, guess I'd better go buy a lotto ticket.
Yeah don’t spend the money unless there’s other vr games you wanna play
Really like the immersion of survival. Aside from the occasional death being so very much more frustrating
My favourite follower from Tales from the Commonwealth is Birdie! I love all the hilarious lines he has as commentary during the main story quests.
    He is great too. He was the first one I found, and we traveled together for a long time before I decided to look up where to find the others.
I’m not sure if Bethesda for Fallout 4 tried their best with the writing, and it’s the best they can do, or if they didn’t try much at all. I’m not sure which would be worse.

I just wish they went in on either choice. Either get rid of traditional NPCs and make a more survival exploration focused game with significant additions to the gameplay, or make a game with a story that’s not garbage. Fallout 76 is the former, but without any of the additions.
    Mostly I think they ended up with quantity over quality in terms of content.  255 distinct quests, with a bunch of those repeatable/radiant. 17 permanent companions (if you count dogmeat and the random robots you can build).  Four main quest factions with distinct and overlapping quest lines.  It's... A lot.
This along with some of the sim settlement features built  in would have been great. 

Also a proper raider faction from the beginning. When you first go to Bunker Hill you can claim to be a raider, and your character yells it in a very aggro way, making me think at one point you actually could be a raider during development.
    Nuka World is a thing, so I wouldn't be surprised if they had that storyline in progress, couldn't finish it in time so cut it. Then, they simply did their raider thing for Nuka World.
    Yeah with all the cut content it sure does sound like they wanted to let you go raider
That would’ve been great. But Bethesda is lazy and stupid. I’ve been playing fallout 4 for several years now and not once have I managed to build in all of the settlement locations. Hell after a certain amount it becomes pointless. You end up having to help a settlement while you’re still building. I rarely go the Minuteman route anyway. The building aspect is fun but they overdid it. They should’ve at least added a couple more towns with some named people in them. They could’ve added towns to act as Railroad safehavens, they could’ve even added a few more small towns to walk through. In fallout NV every town had ppl in it. Not this one tho
    That’s right. The established settlements are barren, and have zero dimensional settlers that give you radiant quests.. it’s too empty
        Seriously, though. Would it really have been so difficult for them to add in some unique NPCs and questlines for each settlement? I'm sure there are mods that do it, so that's something... but it easily could have been done in the base game.
        Yeah they literally have the player building the entire world just so they didn’t have to actually put cities into the game. They should’ve put a different engine in it. This game probably couldn’t even support another city added. Simply walking around in town makes your screen go stupid
Especially if you add mods that make the lighting more realistic and add stars in the sky. I have a mod that makes the environment as dark at night as irl and also a mod that replaces the bland sky that with a more impressive night sky with many stars. Because after 200 years of no vehicles or many factories being used the sky should have a lot more stars than just a few specks.
My favorite reddit interaction so far was when I said something like "I don't like the new star wars movies but I have nothing against people who do" and then immediately got downvoted and called toxic.
    Good for you. They’re just butthurt that a shit ton of people hated the sequels and they’d rather blame it on toxicity instead of the issues in the movie
I don't know about "sucks" but I'd say it's easily the weakest of the three. It massively scaled back nearly every mechanic compared to one - armor, weapons, weapon mods, abilities, etc. The only thing it really improved mechanically speaking is the shooting and cover systems. I never understood why it didn't get more flak for that especially when you consider that the follow up to Biowares other big RPG Dragon Age II did basically the same thing and people won't shut up about it.
    Well Mass Effect 2’s gameplay had something DA:II’s didn’t: it was actually fun. And while I love a good looter shooter, Mass Effect 1 was not one of them. I found the loot to become repetitive and boring about half way through the game. Everything felt like a slightly different version of what you had before. (I do love Mass Effect 1 though. The loot just isn’t one of the reasons I love it). 

As far as story/characters/world goes, Mass Effect 2 is  the best one by a mile imo. I love collecting this team of different, powerful people, getting to know them, and having it pay off (or not) in the final mission. And they kept all of the characters from ME:1 in in some way, so I didn’t miss any of them. ME:3 has the worst new characters imo, and I was never a huge fan of either Kaiden or Ashley. 

All in all I think they’re all great games though. Mass Effect 2 was just the one that hit me the hardest when I first played through them all in like 2013.
        I thought DA2 was plenty fun, just in a different way. More of an action game than a strategy one. I do agree with the loot complaint for ME1 - I think ME3 really struck the best balance between complexity and fun. I just never hear anyone mention just how dumbed down 2 is which is so weird to me.

The story was....eh. On a micro scale (quests and characters) it was fantastic, but the macro story was also really scaled down. You went from saving the Galaxy to just kinda trying to save a few colonies. The threat was scaled down from Galaxy ending reapers to these weird enigmatic bug dudes. The plot in general was literally just go get people until something happens. It just wasn't nearly as engaging or interesting overall, even if the individual stories and characters were great. That's another issue I've heard brought up with DA2 that never seems to be a problem with ME2 - people were constantly complaining about how scaled down the plot stakes were. I mean, don't get me wrong, I do like 2 but I always find myself just really wanting to hurry up and get to 3 when I play it. Even if the story is stronger in some ways, the gameplay is just so much more scaled back and disappointing.
Mass Effect 2 sucks
    Aiight I’m outside Denny’s where ya at?!?
Go with my blessing
This is true, though one exception is called “Constructive Criticism”. If you're going to criticize something, then say why instead of just “This is poo-poo”.
    I hear what you’re saying but you can’t critique someone’s opinion. A critique occurs when a creator invites an audience to discuss their feelings regarding a thing the creator is presenting. Then the creator listens and takes it and says thanks. No debate. No differing opinions. Just a critique. This thread is not that. 

This thread is a celebration of a thing. An opinion someone has. Which one could be critical of but why? Why walk up to a group who is drinking beer just to say “I don’t like beer. I prefer wine.” What’s the point? To share how you feel? Why? 

My point is: If the OP or anyone who holds the game in high regard is expected to have enough self respect to not care when someone else dislikes the game then those who dislike it should also have enough self respect to not care when they see someone enjoying it.
        I 100% agree. Though this is something that can't be stopped. People will do it anyway.
        >	This thread is a celebration of a thing. An opinion someone has. Which one could be critical of but why? Why walk up to a group who is drinking beer just to say “I don’t like beer. I prefer wine.” What’s the point? To share how you feel? Why?

Sure in that situation it’s weird. But this isn’t a private conversation. **It’s a public forum** where anyone following the rules may participate in any discussion they wish. 

If you don’t want people to disagree with you then why did you come to the place specifically for discussion? 

If you want a place specifically for celebration then start a sub and ban anyone critical of the games. 

Anyone who comes to a public forum and thinks people with a different opinion should keep them to themselves is a hypocrite.
At hour eleven he got to The Railroad and realized that something was not well in The Commonwealth.
    I will defend my honor as the best railroad heavy in the commonwealth good sir. ;) not everyone likes them thats okay. I came from the ballistic weave and stayed for the people.
        I really wish Glory could have been the railroad companion.
        I don’t have any sort of problem with the railroad as an entity; I sided with them too. The problem I have with the railroad is the same problem I have with *all* the factions in the game: they are terribly written. I think they’re all pretty equally bad though, and the only reason I pick on the railroad is that it’s maybe the earliest that you can realize just how horrendously stupid the story is.
            The writing was really my main gripe with F4. OP has some solid ground here imo, it is a fantastic game with hours upon hours of gameplay to offer to even the most picky of players. 

But I have a powerful bias for great writing, dialogue, and story-telling, and that’s F4s worst components. Also I wish they woulda done more with the coast and underwater aspects of the game, was really hoping we had some giant sea monsters of some kind, besides giant mirelurks,.
                If you look at one of my other comments, you’ll see me defending the game overall. What Fo4 does well, it does *exceptionally* well; unfortunately, what it does poorly, it does exceptionally so as well. I happen to weight the qualities of a game in a way that’s favorable to Fo4, but I think all but the most disinterested players would be turned off by some of the weapons-grade bullshit that passes as plot in that game.
    Nah at 10 hours 1 second he talked to Preston again and got a settlement is asking for help
They kind of lost the storyline directions after that point. The game is fun to play but its just not a good rpg. Great action fps tho.
    Shut up
[deleted]
    Some fragile fans on the loose in here :D
So did a lot of people, it was called Fallout 76, just with less narrative.
    Why would you say something so controversial yet so brave?
    I was going to say that. Lol. But seriously, for all it's early faults, 76 does feel like Fallout now, sometimes more than FO4.
Same
Any idea what it’s called
    I think they're talking about the Conquerer expansion for Sim Settlements.
    Horizon!
This is actually a really good idea. Fallouts main quests are hit or miss. It's the side quests where the game really shines. It fits the world, too. You come out from under a rock to a broken world and have to carve out your own little slice.
    I remember a mod for fallout 3 that "removed" the main quest and spawned you somewhere random.
    Agreed, and this is pretty much the case with most Bethesda RPGs. I would gladly sacrifice Skyrim and Oblivion's main questline for more side quests, too.
        I'm going to have to seriously disagree with removing main quests from TES. Those are usually big events that put the fate of the world on the line.

Edit: Skyrim wouldn't be the same without dragons, or Oblivion without deadra.
            Oh, I hear you. What I'm really saying is that imo, the main questline of most Bethesda RPGs post-Morrowind have been so-so from a gameplay perspective and from a story perspective. I don't think they're terrible or anything, but I think the side quests outshine them in a big way (and in a way that makes me feel more like a resident of the world than a convenient player-god). So that's what I mean when I say I'd trade those main quests for more side quests. I'm just saying, "I'll take less of that and more of that."
        Oblivion's main quest is honestly my favourite questline in Oblivion. TES Main Quests are a vital part of the games in my opinion, while in Fallout they aren't as important.
            Yeah, definitely will have to agree to disagree on that one, then. I liked the ending to Oblivion's main quest, but not much else. The side quests on the other hand, were much better, in my opinion. The Thieves Guild, the Dark Brotherhood, etc.
Yeah, I gotta call a bit of BS on some of those percentages. 

Too many times I've done this silly or mundane thing in a game, got an achievement, and see only like 4-6% of others have gotten it.

And I mean, sure I'd buy it for something really abstract like jumping on a particular object or something, but for killing X amount of enemies on a map? Really?
    The ones that confuse me the most are like the one from 76 that's  just "leave the vault" and it's at like 76% 

Wtf are the other 24% of people doing?
        I mean considering it's 76 I can imagine many people turned it on immediately saw glitches and or bugs and just straight up never played again, but also yea 24% of the thousands playing it? Seems a bit much
Yeah I played 1 and 2 but couldn’t get into Tactics at all, it felt even more different
3 isn't the first letter on the keyboard?
I've tried playing the original two (I actually have them on disk from way back when I had my first PC), just couldn't get on with them at all. Gameplay bored the shit outta me.
I'll do that,  because i haven't gotten past that, yet. Thank you!
Because 3 is still a great game? Do you stop playing an old game when the sequel gets released? Yeah 4 may be better than 3, but 3 is still really fun to play. I don't play it just for nostalgia, I play it because it was a good game.
I mean I don't think that's entirely fair. Personally I hate fallout 4's story it just didn't connect for me and there is just something special about roaming a ruined DC.
Liam Neeson.
    Was searching for this
It wasn't a half bad Mario Kart game though, if you think about it
I think those people didn't like the quantity over quality approach to the Souls 2 bosses. I haven't touched it in a while but it had 40(?) bosses in the base game and quite a few of them were very easy, compared to ~20 in both Dks1 and dks3.

Regardless, I agree. It's a dark souls game if it has 'Dark Souls' in the title. It might need improvement but it's a solid entry nonetheless.
Cyberpunk not so much. That game has more issues beyond just being misunderstood. The fact the game is borderline unplayable for over half it's userbase to this day is not a good sign.
    3 years in the future when everyone has a next gen console its going to be fine to think it was good, instead of the mess that it is on ps4 and xbox one
    Yeah, it's still not on PlayStation store, right?  I'm kinda using that as a bellwether.  When/if PlayStation store allows it back in, I'll consider it "OK" enough to play.  Until then, I'm just waiting on patch after patch.
    Still waiting for it to be fixed enough to do a first time playthrough, and it looks like I'll be waiting for a good while.
Cyberpink will never get this treatment for sure.

Bugs, bad performance (even on PC on new RTX3000's), inherently boring gameplay, bad written story, physics worse that fucking Goat Simulator...

Sorry, that game can't be saved. It has literally no point where it is "okay". It's lacking in every department where a game can lack in. It's not even that the players didn't get what was promised. They got literal garbage.

Even No Man's Sky had at least the procedural generation, which gave it some uniqueness.
I don't know about Cyberpunk. Bethesda games are completed games that aren't ironed out at all, but Cyberpunk was an uncompleted game that was rushed to release. Unless they're willing to totally revamp the game and either eliminate the leftovers or implement them (like making lethal vs non-lethal matter, as an easy example,) I don't think it will be propped up any more than a solid GTA clone with potential. 

But what we've got now is basically a template for the type of GTA/RPG mashup that a lot of gamers want to see, someone just needs to make it. And that race is different than the solo one that CDPR was running before.
    I really enjoyed Cyberpunk. Sure it had its bugs but the game is really fun to me.
        It was good but still nothing that special (besides story and music) even disregarding bugs, which is not easy.
            >still nothing that special (besides story and music) even disregarding bugs

So, the Witcher 3.
                Kinda. Witcher 3 was much better though. Cyberpunk’s gameplay is good, both have great stories with high quality voice acting and the open world is amazing in both of them. (but there is not much side activities in them.) but Witcher 3 is the superior game overall if that makes sense.
        Oh me too, I think it's a solid game. I just don't think it's anything that is going to improve significantly as time goes on, we've got what we've got.
    The game won't get a revamp and doesn't need it. It needs fixing. It does what it does pretty well. 

For the people who want a gta in the future they have to look elsewhere.
        What I'm saying is that it already is GTA in the future. What it's not is a groundbreaking immersive RPG like the one that was promised.
            Apart from an open world and cars it has really not much in common with GTA.
                You mean aside from the base format of the the game world it's not like GTA? Seriously, this isn't criticism or even really insight, it's just the genre. Cyberpunk is *absolutely* an open world, semi-linear sandbox story game, like GTA. If someone said they wanted GTA in the future I would have no qualms about recommending Cyberpunk, it would probably be the closest I could think of. Maybe Saints Row IV, but that's a different kind of sci-fi.
                    One is an open world action adventure the other an open world rpg. Like I said they share the characteristics of an open world in which you can drive cars, other than that not much.
                        Don't know why you're being downvoted. GTA doesn't have dialogue choices, levels, perk choices, builds, and various endings. People just see surface level these days and it makes discussion impossible if you want to add nuance.
    It was incomplete because of incompetent management while covid 19 forced developers to work at home. They didn't create a development pipeline for everyone to work toward; each developer was largely left to their own devices instead of being able to contribute to the overall team effort, which lead to a lot of the problems the game has today. There's plenty out there to read about it.
Yeah no, it's only a matter of time until CDPR abandon that game entirely.
This is like my friend with 76, bugs were one issue, but not the whole issue, a lot of 76's, Skyrim's, FO4's bugs have been fixed, but, in my eyes, they are still all unplayable.
Does F76 run better now? I'm kinda on the fence about picking it up (Im playing alone as well), but despite me having really good internet and hardware, I had weird hit detection and lags in the beta and on free weekends (like shooting at ghouls, but getting the hit marker 0.5sec later and laggy VATS, so not enough to make it unplayable, but pretty annoying)
    The gameplay can definitely still be pretty unresponsive, it's not great, but better than it was, coming from an avid 76 player. The latency varies quite a bit from server to server and how long the instance has been running/how much load is on the server at the time. Private runs very smooth, close to fo4 +whatever server latency there is.
I'd try it if it wasn't multiplayer, but since it is I'll stay away.

Has nothing to do with the quality of the rest of the game, I'm just absolutely not interested in a Mp-Fallout and the differences that brings with it.
    It has pros and cons. I thought the same thing but then I started to do the events and daily quests. Having constant events and seasons makes it feel way more alive. I still play it like a single player fallout but now I can enjoy the new eve TS that happen like the mole miner treasure hunters that's happening now.
>If you've played and love 4 you'll love 76.

I was expecting that, but nope.

76 took the things I loved most in Fallout 4 - exploring/hunting for junk, and digging up stories, and made me hate them.

I've got too many gripes with FO76, and no hope that they'll address any of them. I didn't care about the lack of NPCs, I just didn't want the game to feel like a chore, like work. But it did. And the updates they introduced only made it worse.
You CAN solo it now, but you have to have the monthly subscription to have private servers. I just started playing through it that way and so far it pretty much just feels like another fallout game. Not being able to pause sucks, but I'm having fun.
I've been playing since launch. Never given them a penny. Literally - I bought the disc on eBay. Second character's about to hit level 200. There's plenty to do.
    At launch there was barely any endgame. Sure they fixed it with updates, but even with these updates they introduced daily or weekly limited resources like some mobile game
        Isn’t there being no endgame kind of the point in a continuously, dynamically evolving online game like F76?
I'd never get any game the requires a season fucking pass, that's so ridiculous


Season these nuts Bethesda
    76 doesn't require a season pass. 

You get it for free?
        Nah it's 12 bucks a month if you want anything more than a bare bones grinding experience.
            No its not? I bought it once and have gotten stuff from the season pass, like the clothing, power armor ect.
                [I'm talking about this](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/10/23/fallout-76-now-has-a-premium-monthly-subscription-fee-no-seriously/)
                    Yeah they changed it a but from when this article was written 2 years ago. 

Currently it gives; Private servers, a scrap box, survival tent, monthly atoms, the ranger armor, and icons/emotes.
                        It's not "required" but it's heavily implied those who don't use it are at a disadvantage to those who do. In an online game that can become rather unpleasant with griefers and stuff. And the only way to avoid them is the monthly subscription.
    Would you support season passes such as COD MW where everything on the season pass is only cosmetic based or blueprints but anything like new guns is free 

Not really pay to play, more like pay to flex
        It is a slippery slope, that EA comment on here that was downvoted to shit is a good example of why.



Personally, I will put a game down for long periods of time and might not pick it up at all ever again. Spending money on cosmetic stuff like that and investing into it stresses me out more than I enjoy it because I feel inclined to play it over others. When I unlock stuff organically I don't have that issue.


And at the end of the day they're all obvious cash grabs. New content in games I think should be the most part free, or able to unlock through playing. It's definitely better for the gaming community itself.
See, this issue you're describing is the kind of thing I hope they fix in the next Fallout and next Elder Scrolls game.  I want the next generation of these games to be more realistic in the NPC programming, but I fear that what we're going to get is just "bigger more."

There was an interview with Todd about the sequel to Skyrim, and he said something like, "If people enjoyed Skyrim for years, then I want the next one to be something they enjoy for decades," and I just wanted to barf.  I don't want a game that is so damn massive that I won't complete it before I die.  But I *do* want a game that is more immersive, more "real" feeling, and that requires only 3 things: better writing, better graphics, and better AI.

And I don't need MUCH better graphics.  If I'm happy with Skyrim in 2021, then *whatever* they have in the coming years will obviously supplant that.  And I don't even need much better AI.  I just need *some* more depth.  Can they just erect barricades when they see/hear their buddies getting stomped?  Can they close a door and ready to ambush me when I burst through?  Can they relocate to another building or higher ground?  Can they fall back and ally with another group so that they have strength in numbers?  Can they raise a flag of surrender and hope I spare their lives?

I've done programming most of my life.  I can imagine creating some modules for this kind of responsiveness.  The real question is: how much can they cram in, and are they even being asked to do it?  From what Todd said, he's creating a very massive game world that is incredibly shallow.  But I'm going to cross my fingers and hope for more.
    I think the biggest problem with the AI is that it was never designed with ranged combat in mind.

"Creation" is just a highly modified Gamebryo, and that was meant for sword fights.

Yes, the AI could still use better tactics and behaviors, but the biggest issue is it doesn't know how to treat an attack if it isn't a full on melee fight, because the second you crouch from a far enough distance the AI loses you and reverts to standby.
Same with Cyberpunk. I avoided all media on purpose, until spent 100 hours in the game. Had exactly 3 bugs/glitches. Before patches.

Console launch was terrible and there is no denying that there were bugs. But the overall experience I personally had was amazing.
    Respect i disliked Cyberpunk but i can see why people did like it. Personally I got a few game breaking bugs but if ya didnt get any of those I imagine it was pretty fun!
        Story and side missions made this game enjoyable for me. You can watch it as a movie.

I played on normal difficulty, but once I got some perks in to handheld guns combat became extremely easy, instakilling everyone. That helped with the "movie" like gameplay.

I will replay it again in a year or two. I hope I will have for a challenge then.
I like Fallout 4 just fine. I made a whole thread about [modding it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/7fpf28/how_i_learned_to_love_fallout_4_by_modding_it_to/) so I could like it more.

However, it is not any better now than it ever was. It's a middling Fallout game, as Fallout games go.

>The skills and synergies are better than older fallouts IMO 

Yeah, you're probably going to have to stand alone on that one, sorry. :)
    It is definitely not better now than ever. But like you said circlejerks are powerful and people were attacked for just saying anything positive on launch just cause it it wasnt New Vegas 2 story wise. Now that the hate has calmed down peeps now talk about it more positively. Its definitely not a bot squad by Bethesda to support a 6 year old game that they dont support anymore.

And I definitely am not alone the old skill systems are kinda dated (literally a board game system) and there are a lot of just useless stats (Ex. Charisma in New Vegas). I start differently in New Vegas but then always nearly max everything by the end. You can make way more diverse builds in FO4 with the insane amount of toys they give you.
The main story of FO3 was pretty bad. FO4' main quest was meh, but its main issue was the side quests, the absurd majority of them are just "go there and kill all enemies".

FO4's "dungeons" are all corridors, which also sucked. In FO3 I had a lot of fun playing as a stealth sniper going through alternate paths to sneak upon my enemies. In FO4 you don't get that option because you just go through corridors, even if you invest in stealth, lockpick, hacking and everything else.
    I agree there were too many “go there and kill everyone” quests in 4.
    I do agree with the basic side quests but you can 100% do a stealth sniper. Most of my playthroughs are a variation of stealth and it may be annoying early game but late game you can go through almost the whole game wiping entire dungeons without being seen by anyone.
        Yeah, but while walking in a corridor. There isn't the part of exploring and finding alternate ways to avoid defenses.
Missing my point, it's pretty much the same story as 3. The major plot points are there, and kinds shows for all the time they spent improving the game's mechanics that they kinda phoned in the story, but you're a mindless fanboy who can't take any criticism, of something they did not make no less, and will just angrily downvote my reply.

Maybe leave an angry message accusing me of being an idiot/hater or combination thereof.
    I downvoted you because what you said was low effort bait lol. Your comment drips with irony, accusing me of being angry or missing the point lmao. I don’t care what you think about Fallout 4; you’re the one who missed the point lol. 

At no point did I say the parallels between 3 and 4’s story weren’t strong, or that 4 reached the storytelling heights the story reached in the past with New Vegas. Nor did I say 4’s story was it’s strongest asset. 

I just said it’s story was better than 3’s. And I stand by that. You inferred everything else. Honestly you should’ve expected a low-effort rebuttal with how low effort your original attempt to bait a response out of me was lol. Have a good one now
        Sorry, I simply don't take anyone serious with more than one "lol" in a paragraph. 

Have fun maturing, kiddo.

Edit: for historical context, the first paragraph had 4 "lols" before they edited it. They removed one, and turned the other into a "lmao".
            Man next time just save yourself the time and write “I give up” or don’t write anything at all
No offense, but sounds like you never really bothered to learn about the weapon upgrade system, beyond “hardened>powerful>advanced aaand I’m done”. It’s true that there are straight upgrades within certain categories like semi automatic or automatic, but these are mostly for receivers. Outside of that you have flamethrower attachments for plasma weapons, scattergun conversions for laser weapons, a variety of sights and scopes to customize the effective range and VATS effectiveness, even conversions to different ammo types. On top of that, you have the constant interplay between damage and weight (and therefore AP drain in VATS). The system isn’t perfect for sure, but it’s far from lazy and is actively encourages people to interact with the best part of the game, the exploration.
    Yeah there were a lot of upgrades, but for the most part there were clear best ones. The energy weapons were definitely better., but they just used it as an excuse for removing a bunch of weapons, lmg, tribeam, plasma thrower, plasma defender, etc. They had some unique upgrades, but stats wise most of them just were not as viable, considering the enemies were leveled, unlike previous games (sorta).
I forget the name, but I seems to recall a mod that replaced the armor in Concord with a shitty Raider one, which made sense, and made Cores/Frames harder to come by... or that may have been two mods.
The point is you’re railing against a criticism that doesn’t exist. OP’s not saying there’s no good reason for there being less detail, just that when you compare the games FO4 has more. The comparison doesn’t have to be ‘fair’.
    It does have to be fair, because otherwise it's invalid
        For critiquing the performance of the developers - yes

For describing the contents and merits of the game - no

OP was going the latter and not the former.
Same here. Cannot wait for SkyOblivion to launch so I can play Oblivion in SkyrimVR with all the VR enhancement mods.
    There was some talk about SkyWind a few years ago, but I wasn't good enough at English to comprehend completely what was being said.

 Now you mention Skyblivion, may I ask you if you know something about it?
        Basically the same thing as Skywind, Oblivion rebuilt on Skyrim's engine.
            Thats awesome ill actually be able yo play morrowind now. I couldn’t get over the awful combat.
He is great too. He was the first one I found, and we traveled together for a long time before I decided to look up where to find the others.
Mostly I think they ended up with quantity over quality in terms of content.  255 distinct quests, with a bunch of those repeatable/radiant. 17 permanent companions (if you count dogmeat and the random robots you can build).  Four main quest factions with distinct and overlapping quest lines.  It's... A lot.
Nuka World is a thing, so I wouldn't be surprised if they had that storyline in progress, couldn't finish it in time so cut it. Then, they simply did their raider thing for Nuka World.
Yeah with all the cut content it sure does sound like they wanted to let you go raider
That’s right. The established settlements are barren, and have zero dimensional settlers that give you radiant quests.. it’s too empty
    Seriously, though. Would it really have been so difficult for them to add in some unique NPCs and questlines for each settlement? I'm sure there are mods that do it, so that's something... but it easily could have been done in the base game.
    Yeah they literally have the player building the entire world just so they didn’t have to actually put cities into the game. They should’ve put a different engine in it. This game probably couldn’t even support another city added. Simply walking around in town makes your screen go stupid
Good for you. They’re just butthurt that a shit ton of people hated the sequels and they’d rather blame it on toxicity instead of the issues in the movie
Well Mass Effect 2’s gameplay had something DA:II’s didn’t: it was actually fun. And while I love a good looter shooter, Mass Effect 1 was not one of them. I found the loot to become repetitive and boring about half way through the game. Everything felt like a slightly different version of what you had before. (I do love Mass Effect 1 though. The loot just isn’t one of the reasons I love it). 

As far as story/characters/world goes, Mass Effect 2 is  the best one by a mile imo. I love collecting this team of different, powerful people, getting to know them, and having it pay off (or not) in the final mission. And they kept all of the characters from ME:1 in in some way, so I didn’t miss any of them. ME:3 has the worst new characters imo, and I was never a huge fan of either Kaiden or Ashley. 

All in all I think they’re all great games though. Mass Effect 2 was just the one that hit me the hardest when I first played through them all in like 2013.
    I thought DA2 was plenty fun, just in a different way. More of an action game than a strategy one. I do agree with the loot complaint for ME1 - I think ME3 really struck the best balance between complexity and fun. I just never hear anyone mention just how dumbed down 2 is which is so weird to me.

The story was....eh. On a micro scale (quests and characters) it was fantastic, but the macro story was also really scaled down. You went from saving the Galaxy to just kinda trying to save a few colonies. The threat was scaled down from Galaxy ending reapers to these weird enigmatic bug dudes. The plot in general was literally just go get people until something happens. It just wasn't nearly as engaging or interesting overall, even if the individual stories and characters were great. That's another issue I've heard brought up with DA2 that never seems to be a problem with ME2 - people were constantly complaining about how scaled down the plot stakes were. I mean, don't get me wrong, I do like 2 but I always find myself just really wanting to hurry up and get to 3 when I play it. Even if the story is stronger in some ways, the gameplay is just so much more scaled back and disappointing.
Aiight I’m outside Denny’s where ya at?!?
I hear what you’re saying but you can’t critique someone’s opinion. A critique occurs when a creator invites an audience to discuss their feelings regarding a thing the creator is presenting. Then the creator listens and takes it and says thanks. No debate. No differing opinions. Just a critique. This thread is not that. 

This thread is a celebration of a thing. An opinion someone has. Which one could be critical of but why? Why walk up to a group who is drinking beer just to say “I don’t like beer. I prefer wine.” What’s the point? To share how you feel? Why? 

My point is: If the OP or anyone who holds the game in high regard is expected to have enough self respect to not care when someone else dislikes the game then those who dislike it should also have enough self respect to not care when they see someone enjoying it.
    I 100% agree. Though this is something that can't be stopped. People will do it anyway.
    >	This thread is a celebration of a thing. An opinion someone has. Which one could be critical of but why? Why walk up to a group who is drinking beer just to say “I don’t like beer. I prefer wine.” What’s the point? To share how you feel? Why?

Sure in that situation it’s weird. But this isn’t a private conversation. **It’s a public forum** where anyone following the rules may participate in any discussion they wish. 

If you don’t want people to disagree with you then why did you come to the place specifically for discussion? 

If you want a place specifically for celebration then start a sub and ban anyone critical of the games. 

Anyone who comes to a public forum and thinks people with a different opinion should keep them to themselves is a hypocrite.
I will defend my honor as the best railroad heavy in the commonwealth good sir. ;) not everyone likes them thats okay. I came from the ballistic weave and stayed for the people.
    I really wish Glory could have been the railroad companion.
    I don’t have any sort of problem with the railroad as an entity; I sided with them too. The problem I have with the railroad is the same problem I have with *all* the factions in the game: they are terribly written. I think they’re all pretty equally bad though, and the only reason I pick on the railroad is that it’s maybe the earliest that you can realize just how horrendously stupid the story is.
        The writing was really my main gripe with F4. OP has some solid ground here imo, it is a fantastic game with hours upon hours of gameplay to offer to even the most picky of players. 

But I have a powerful bias for great writing, dialogue, and story-telling, and that’s F4s worst components. Also I wish they woulda done more with the coast and underwater aspects of the game, was really hoping we had some giant sea monsters of some kind, besides giant mirelurks,.
            If you look at one of my other comments, you’ll see me defending the game overall. What Fo4 does well, it does *exceptionally* well; unfortunately, what it does poorly, it does exceptionally so as well. I happen to weight the qualities of a game in a way that’s favorable to Fo4, but I think all but the most disinterested players would be turned off by some of the weapons-grade bullshit that passes as plot in that game.
Nah at 10 hours 1 second he talked to Preston again and got a settlement is asking for help
Shut up
Some fragile fans on the loose in here :D
Why would you say something so controversial yet so brave?
I was going to say that. Lol. But seriously, for all it's early faults, 76 does feel like Fallout now, sometimes more than FO4.
I think they're talking about the Conquerer expansion for Sim Settlements.
Horizon!
I remember a mod for fallout 3 that "removed" the main quest and spawned you somewhere random.
Agreed, and this is pretty much the case with most Bethesda RPGs. I would gladly sacrifice Skyrim and Oblivion's main questline for more side quests, too.
    I'm going to have to seriously disagree with removing main quests from TES. Those are usually big events that put the fate of the world on the line.

Edit: Skyrim wouldn't be the same without dragons, or Oblivion without deadra.
        Oh, I hear you. What I'm really saying is that imo, the main questline of most Bethesda RPGs post-Morrowind have been so-so from a gameplay perspective and from a story perspective. I don't think they're terrible or anything, but I think the side quests outshine them in a big way (and in a way that makes me feel more like a resident of the world than a convenient player-god). So that's what I mean when I say I'd trade those main quests for more side quests. I'm just saying, "I'll take less of that and more of that."
    Oblivion's main quest is honestly my favourite questline in Oblivion. TES Main Quests are a vital part of the games in my opinion, while in Fallout they aren't as important.
        Yeah, definitely will have to agree to disagree on that one, then. I liked the ending to Oblivion's main quest, but not much else. The side quests on the other hand, were much better, in my opinion. The Thieves Guild, the Dark Brotherhood, etc.
The ones that confuse me the most are like the one from 76 that's  just "leave the vault" and it's at like 76% 

Wtf are the other 24% of people doing?
    I mean considering it's 76 I can imagine many people turned it on immediately saw glitches and or bugs and just straight up never played again, but also yea 24% of the thousands playing it? Seems a bit much

I still play it like a single player fallout but now I can enjoy the new eve TS that happen like the mole miner treasure hunters that's happening now.
At launch there was barely any endgame. Sure they fixed it with updates, but even with these updates they introduced daily or weekly limited resources like some mobile game
    Isn’t there being no endgame kind of the point in a continuously, dynamically evolving online game like F76?
76 doesn't require a season pass. 

You get it for free?
    Nah it's 12 bucks a month if you want anything more than a bare bones grinding experience.
        No its not? I bought it once and have gotten stuff from the season pass, like the clothing, power armor ect.
            [I'm talking about this](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/10/23/fallout-76-now-has-a-premium-monthly-subscription-fee-no-seriously/)
                Yeah they changed it a but from when this article was written 2 years ago. 

Currently it gives; Private servers, a scrap box, survival tent, monthly atoms, the ranger armor, and icons/emotes.
                    It's not "required" but it's heavily implied those who don't use it are at a disadvantage to those who do. In an online game that can become rather unpleasant with griefers and stuff. And the only way to avoid them is the monthly subscription.
Would you support season passes such as COD MW where everything on the season pass is only cosmetic based or blueprints but anything like new guns is free 

Not really pay to play, more like pay to flex
    It is a slippery slope, that EA comment on here that was downvoted to shit is a good example of why.



Personally, I will put a game down for long periods of time and might not pick it up at all ever again. Spending money on cosmetic stuff like that and investing into it stresses me out more than I enjoy it because I feel inclined to play it over others. When I unlock stuff organically I don't have that issue.


And at the end of the day they're all obvious cash grabs. New content in games I think should be the most part free, or able to unlock through playing. It's definitely better for the gaming community itself.
I think the biggest problem with the AI is that it was never designed with ranged combat in mind.

"Creation" is just a highly modified Gamebryo, and that was meant for sword fights.

Yes, the AI could still use better tactics and behaviors, but the biggest issue is it doesn't know how to treat an attack if it isn't a full on melee fight, because the second you crouch from a far enough distance the AI loses you and reverts to standby.
Respect i disliked Cyberpunk but i can see why people did like it. Personally I got a few game breaking bugs but if ya didnt get any of those I imagine it was pretty fun!
    Story and side missions made this game enjoyable for me. You can watch it as a movie.

I played on normal difficulty, but once I got some perks in to handheld guns combat became extremely easy, instakilling everyone. That helped with the "movie" like gameplay.

I will replay it again in a year or two. I hope I will have for a challenge then.
It is definitely not better now than ever. But like you said circlejerks are powerful and people were attacked for just saying anything positive on launch just cause it it wasnt New Vegas 2 story wise. Now that the hate has calmed down peeps now talk about it more positively. Its definitely not a bot squad by Bethesda to support a 6 year old game that they dont support anymore.

And I definitely am not alone the old skill systems are kinda dated (literally a board game system) and there are a lot of just useless stats (Ex. Charisma in New Vegas). I start differently in New Vegas but then always nearly max everything by the end. You can make way more diverse builds in FO4 with the insane amount of toys they give you.
I agree there were too many “go there and kill everyone” quests in 4.
I do agree with the basic side quests but you can 100% do a stealth sniper. Most of my playthroughs are a variation of stealth and it may be annoying early game but late game you can go through almost the whole game wiping entire dungeons without being seen by anyone.
    Yeah, but while walking in a corridor. There isn't the part of exploring and finding alternate ways to avoid defenses.
I downvoted you because what you said was low effort bait lol. Your comment drips with irony, accusing me of being angry or missing the point lmao. I don’t care what you think about Fallout 4; you’re the one who missed the point lol. 

At no point did I say the parallels between 3 and 4’s story weren’t strong, or that 4 reached the storytelling heights the story reached in the past with New Vegas. Nor did I say 4’s story was it’s strongest asset. 

I just said it’s story was better than 3’s. And I stand by that. You inferred everything else. Honestly you should’ve expected a low-effort rebuttal with how low effort your original attempt to bait a response out of me was lol. Have a good one now
    Sorry, I simply don't take anyone serious with more than one "lol" in a paragraph. 

Have fun maturing, kiddo.

Edit: for historical context, the first paragraph had 4 "lols" before they edited it. They removed one, and turned the other into a "lmao".
        Man next time just save yourself the time and write “I give up” or don’t write anything at all
Yeah there were a lot of upgrades, but for the most part there were clear best ones. The energy weapons were definitely better., but they just used it as an excuse for removing a bunch of weapons, lmg, tribeam, plasma thrower, plasma defender, etc. They had some unique upgrades, but stats wise most of them just were not as viable, considering the enemies were leveled, unlike previous games (sorta).
It does have to be fair, because otherwise it's invalid
    For critiquing the performance of the developers - yes

For describing the contents and merits of the game - no

OP was going the latter and not the former.
There was some talk about SkyWind a few years ago, but I wasn't good enough at English to comprehend completely what was being said.

 Now you mention Skyblivion, may I ask you if you know something about it?
    Basically the same thing as Skywind, Oblivion rebuilt on Skyrim's engine.
        Thats awesome ill actually be able yo play morrowind now. I couldn’t get over the awful combat.
Seriously, though. Would it really have been so difficult for them to add in some unique NPCs and questlines for each settlement? I'm sure there are mods that do it, so that's something... but it easily could have been done in the base game.
Yeah they literally have the player building the entire world just so they didn’t have to actually put cities into the game. They should’ve put a different engine in it. This game probably couldn’t even support another city added. Simply walking around in town makes your screen go stupid
I thought DA2 was plenty fun, just in a different way. More of an action game than a strategy one. I do agree with the loot complaint for ME1 - I think ME3 really struck the best balance between complexity and fun. I just never hear anyone mention just how dumbed down 2 is which is so weird to me.

The story was....eh. On a micro scale (quests and characters) it was fantastic, but the macro story was also really scaled down. You went from saving the Galaxy to just kinda trying to save a few colonies. The threat was scaled down from Galaxy ending reapers to these weird enigmatic bug dudes. The plot in general was literally just go get people until something happens. It just wasn't nearly as engaging or interesting overall, even if the individual stories and characters were great. That's another issue I've heard brought up with DA2 that never seems to be a problem with ME2 - people were constantly complaining about how scaled down the plot stakes were. I mean, don't get me wrong, I do like 2 but I always find myself just really wanting to hurry up and get to 3 when I play it. Even if the story is stronger in some ways, the gameplay is just so much more scaled back and disappointing.
I 100% agree. Though this is something that can't be stopped. People will do it anyway.
>	This thread is a celebration of a thing. An opinion someone has. Which one could be critical of but why? Why walk up to a group who is drinking beer just to say “I don’t like beer. I prefer wine.” What’s the point? To share how you feel? Why?

Sure in that situation it’s weird. But this isn’t a private conversation. **It’s a public forum** where anyone following the rules may participate in any discussion they wish. 

If you don’t want people to disagree with you then why did you come to the place specifically for discussion? 

If you want a place specifically for celebration then start a sub and ban anyone critical of the games. 

Anyone who comes to a public forum and thinks people with a different opinion should keep them to themselves is a hypocrite.
I really wish Glory could have been the railroad companion.
I don’t have any sort of problem with the railroad as an entity; I sided with them too. The problem I have with the railroad is the same problem I have with *all* the factions in the game: they are terribly written. I think they’re all pretty equally bad though, and the only reason I pick on the railroad is that it’s maybe the earliest that you can realize just how horrendously stupid the story is.
    The writing was really my main gripe with F4. OP has some solid ground here imo, it is a fantastic game with hours upon hours of gameplay to offer to even the most picky of players. 

But I have a powerful bias for great writing, dialogue, and story-telling, and that’s F4s worst components. Also I wish they woulda done more with the coast and underwater aspects of the game, was really hoping we had some giant sea monsters of some kind, besides giant mirelurks,.
        If you look at one of my other comments, you’ll see me defending the game overall. What Fo4 does well, it does *exceptionally* well; unfortunately, what it does poorly, it does exceptionally so as well. I happen to weight the qualities of a game in a way that’s favorable to Fo4, but I think all but the most disinterested players would be turned off by some of the weapons-grade bullshit that passes as plot in that game.
I'm going to have to seriously disagree with removing main quests from TES. Those are usually big events that put the fate of the world on the line.

Edit: Skyrim wouldn't be the same without dragons, or Oblivion without deadra.
    Oh, I hear you. What I'm really saying is that imo, the main questline of most Bethesda RPGs post-Morrowind have been so-so from a gameplay perspective and from a story perspective. I don't think they're terrible or anything, but I think the side quests outshine them in a big way (and in a way that makes me feel more like a resident of the world than a convenient player-god). So that's what I mean when I say I'd trade those main quests for more side quests. I'm just saying, "I'll take less of that and more of that."
Oblivion's main quest is honestly my favourite questline in Oblivion. TES Main Quests are a vital part of the games in my opinion, while in Fallout they aren't as important.
    Yeah, definitely will have to agree to disagree on that one, then. I liked the ending to Oblivion's main quest, but not much else. The side quests on the other hand, were much better, in my opinion. The Thieves Guild, the Dark Brotherhood, etc.
I mean considering it's 76 I can imagine many people turned it on immediately saw glitches and or bugs and just straight up never played again, but also yea 24% of the thousands playing it? Seems a bit much
It was good but still nothing that special (besides story and music) even disregarding bugs, which is not easy.
    >still nothing that special (besides story and music) even disregarding bugs

So, the Witcher 3.
        Kinda. Witcher 3 was much better though. Cyberpunk’s gameplay is good, both have great stories with high quality voice acting and the open world is amazing in both of them. (but there is not much side activities in them.) but Witcher 3 is the superior game overall if that makes sense.
Oh me too, I think it's a solid game. I just don't think it's anything that is going to improve significantly as time goes on, we've got what we've got.
What I'm saying is that it already is GTA in the future. What it's not is a groundbreaking immersive RPG like the one that was promised.
    Apart from an open world and cars it has really not much in common with GTA.
        You mean aside from the base format of the the game world it's not like GTA? Seriously, this isn't criticism or even really insight, it's just the genre. Cyberpunk is *absolutely* an open world, semi-linear sandbox story game, like GTA. If someone said they wanted GTA in the future I would have no qualms about recommending Cyberpunk, it would probably be the closest I could think of. Maybe Saints Row IV, but that's a different kind of sci-fi.
            One is an open world action adventure the other an open world rpg. Like I said they share the characteristics of an open world in which you can drive cars, other than that not much.
                Don't know why you're being downvoted. GTA doesn't have dialogue choices, levels, perk choices, builds, and various endings. People just see surface level these days and it makes discussion impossible if you want to add nuance.
Isn’t there being no endgame kind of the point in a continuously, dynamically evolving online game like F76?
