[[Great update but....]]





Meme all you want but new cases will give them the money to focus on the important things: newer cases
    And more sussy stickers
        And Zeus skins
            And chicken skins
                Are we forgetting about the release of the grenade skins?
    So‚Ä¶how much money does it take? Valve is a billion $ corporation.
When you spend $20 putting stickers on your guns for the update to come out two days laterü§°
    Same brother I just put 4 lenticulars on a FN headshot 2 days ago.
    Somebody applied a 2014 kato ibp paper to a panthera onca an hour before the update. So it could be worse.
    I applied 130$ mlg holos night before.
Fuck the case, the sticker placement stuff seems awesome
    I saw the n word on an AK
        That build was also possible before the update FYI
        I saw the Zeus skin where a Greek god shags... Well see for yourself, this is clearly NSFW:D
    But what does this have to do with gameplay?
        Oh nothing at all, games rough BUT, the stickers üòçüòçüòç
            Why not just go buy some stickers at your local gas station if that‚Äôs your thing?
                Cause I can't get epic stickers to go on my ak47 like I can in sounter crike
                    Yes you can, I spent a few seconds on Google and found this.

                        Unironically I love some of those. Thank you for the link
        didn't you know? a good skin can improve your aim up to 30%!
            it‚Äôs 50% on awp iirc, add in a decent knife to switch to and you won‚Äôt have to train ever again
    Something new to distract you from the fact the game is infested with cheaters xD
        Aye man I play just to see my pretty sticker crafts and skins
Jingle the keys in front of us and we are distracted
    honestly works for me lol 420 noscope
I really wish valve and other shooter companies would care more about the integrity of their games. Valve/Steam makes so much money that they could actually make an honest effort to get a head of cheaters and they just don't. It's fucking sad man. I would love to play a game where everyone is honest and legit. We will probably never get that but that's my wish.
    Valorant is nice tbh; been playing for a week, got 0 cheaters in about 15 games, 
Cs2 i get a cheater every other game, if not every game lol
        I‚Äôve played a lot of Val and as far as combating cheating they‚Äôre the best at it. However I don‚Äôt enjoy the agent aspect of Val. I like that everyone has the same utility and no one gets ultimates. Maybe I will go back to Val just to avoid so much cheating on cs2.
            If they added extra mode where no custom agents skills are there, they would see lot of people trying the game
    They don't because just look at this sub. Usually crying about hacking or some other shit. But look once they release some fkin stickers and a gamblers box, everything is forgotten. Memory of a a fkin fish. So they know that and they do not care.
    At this point, can they even make an honest effort against cheating without it completely eating their financials? They'd have to ban a quarter of the player base to eradicate cheating, and that's obviously never gonna happen.
        Do you realize how much money they make a month off of case openings alone? Valve will be just fine when it comes to money. And that‚Äôs just case openings and not how much they make selling other peoples games on steam.
            I know, but if they ban a metric ton of the player base, how would that affect their  earnings? Their reputation? The implications of banning so many people? Not to mention how much they would need to invest into an effective anti cheat solution. Why do you think these things aren't connected? 

Running a business is not that simple and there's many things to consider before making huge decisions like these.
                To add to this they didn't just ruin the reputation of one game, CS:GO is gone forever. They've probably destroyed a whole franchise tbh. With all the money they could pour into this they could make a whole entire new esport. It was borderline on that level in esports before this debacle. They will just stay where they were a little before CS2, an old game still running on old box sales for some reason being completely forgetten about. CS2 is not a new game it's just a heavy upgrade with many negative side effects.
                Their reputation? For banning cheaters? It would be a great thing‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ they make so much fucking money they wouldn‚Äôt be affected as much as you think.
    Because the fan base cares about skins above all else. The fan base is the exact reason that they don‚Äôt focus on QOL improvements. Why change gears when the money is rolling right in?
    Look into LAN parties in your local area! They are SO FUN :)
        I‚Äôve done many LAN parties and they are a blast. I‚Äôm older now and it‚Äôs not for me anymore.
It's sad that the cheaters I posted about that made the front page are still not banned
You got to make a meme like this but it says:  


Ban cheaters: no  


Ban legit players for griefing: yes
The update feels really bad for me, the netcode just feels  awful causing all sorts strange rubberbanding and stutter, smokes look weird like they added glitter, i just dont get it.

I just want CSGO smoothness and performance where I'm not feeling like I'm fighting against the binds of whatever the network or subtick stuff is doing. Feels like shackles.
    After this update I haven‚Äôt had any issues. Might want to do some isp testing
        No, it definitely did get worse. However, enabling streamlined ptt in audio fixed it for me.
    Update defenitely fixed peeker advantage a bit, it feels better for sure
Can‚Äôt believe they didn‚Äôt address cheaters
    Probably because announcing to cheaters that you're altering the system isn't a good way of showing your hand.
    It's standard practice to not bring up cheaters unless there is a ban wave. You leave them in the dark as much as possible. Not like everyone doesn't know the game is infested with cheaters. It's nothing like CS:GO? How did that have less cheaters than this? I don't get it...
    Its because the issue isn‚Äôt as bad as reddit would have you believe
        ![gif](giphy|K0Hy2NwI8IXZK)
        Uh yes it is lol
        How to say you‚Äôre low elo without saying you‚Äôre low elo.
            16.6k 
wouldn‚Äôt say that‚Äôs low, wouldn‚Äôt say that‚Äôs high
                The cheaters are mainly at 20k+.
                    That‚Äôs about 0.2% of the playerbase according to leetify.  Which means the vast majority of players aren‚Äôt encountering cheaters
                        Cs2 leaderboard says that 20k is around top 2-3%. You‚Äôre right, most players arent encountering them. However, that top tier is unplayable.
        downvoted to hell for telling the truth, i've not seen a single cheater since last vac wave lol

on the other hand, almost everygame enemies cry about wh and aimbot, when i know my team is legit, hmm how comes
"So honey, what did you spend your allowance on?"
VAC is designed to keep honest players opening cases waiting for the next wave that won't do shit.
Did the new update also completely remove custom servers like surf? The legacy version no longer works
This community can't be pleased. People moan and whine that there's no new case, no new operation, too many bugs, too many cheaters, movement is shit and when they bring out a patch with adjustments and a case, it's a thread with complaining.
    IDGAF about cosmetic stickers and skins just get these cheating kids out of my premier games. I swear in 20k rating games you encounter a cheater way too frequently like 1 in 3 games.
    Most of the community complain about cheaters and its fairly resonable since cs is most competetive fps shooter out there and they add world leaderboard without adressing cheater issue AT ALL.
With the new update out I now think there's actually even more cheaters than I thought. 
Just yesterday 2super bad aimbots on same team(and we still won lol) 
And then like 3-4 esp/wallhackers next game. (Because of course, they would just refuse to check any proper angles and would instead check super stupid positions you'd take just for surprise attack, and what's funny is that all of the enemy team players exhibited this behavior and none of them were premade)
Most egregious example was me shift walking around behind pillar on ancient and my friend being in front of pillar, guy proceeds to peek and kill him, then round me around pillar and when I think I'd get him, he peeks me. Lol, sure. There was no info I was in this half of the map at all.
That's the worst it has been so far
    Why is it always the enemy team that's hacking?
        I never said my teammates didn't. Just not that game

Just last game today reported chinese teammate with 300 hours. He was doing super sus plays and was CONSTANTLY playing with bison. 
Thats in a lobby where everyone else had 2000 hours at least, 1 guy 7500, and one guy 12000 hours.
Should just shut down the sites that sell them.
I just want my cl\_righthand 0
I just feel sorry for the left handers, I guess they have to use right hand for another "many" months until it blisters
Yup, just another distraction from the sad state the game is in.
I get it but did you not even read the release notes? 

Or is it, hey my turn to shit on Valve please upvote?
    Nothing in the patch notes said anything about VAC or anticheat.
        Of course, what do you want? "Hey cheater, I've just updated VAC, stop playing and wait till new cheats come"? Dude, you are naive as hell.
            All the cheat providers channel I joined on TG said nothing about any update to VAC, because when Valve updates VAC and ban starts, the cheat providers update their cheats to not get detected. 

So yea, everything is fine, VAC is not updated, don't suck Valve's Ass, they are focused on cases and earning money.
                Thanks for that info.
Cheating situation has gotten better for me in the last 2 weeks. Wonder if I got a behind-the-scenes trust factor boost.
    Im at 100% Trust, on faceitfinder, have over 6k games and medals since 2014, 
Been getting cheaters every game, on team and enemy team, 
Its not about trust atp lol
        Same but i nearly never see a cheater.
[removed]
    Clown take
        I'd probably agree if I haven't been called a hacker at least once a week in Counter-Strike for the last 20 years.

Figure it the fuck out.
            Dude got called a cheater in a casual at 3am on a weekday and has been riding the high ever since.
                Shit predates "casual matchmaking" and even Steam. Got an aerodynamic brain, huh?
                    Oh thank God you replied, my side of fries have literally ZERO salt on them. Cheers.
                        Bruh, for fuck's sake. Sit down, nerd.
                            I am? You think I eat standing up? Tf man
                                So dumb.  Have fun throwing rocks at trees or whatever.
                                    damn both yall need to shut up
            Ik you ain‚Äôt talking to me saying figure it tf out I‚Äôm 20k rating
                Is that the new "I'm CAL-I"?
        At least I'm not playing and complaining about a game that I seemingly despise.  Like the lot of you.  ü§°
    Sounds like a typical hacker pushing their agenda.
        Yes. I hack on a 17 year old account with 425 games and $2k worth of cs skins. Fucking scrub
            cope harder poorcel
    Until I meet a blatant Aim Botter who is killing the whole team while bunny jumping, or instances where the game becomes HvH. Bro, if you don't play in Eastern European or Singaporean servers, it's not my mistake that you are not facing cheaters. Shit is bad in these servers and cheaters are blatant. 

It feels weird when people ignore legitimate videos and go on sucking Valve's ass just because their region has less cheaters.
        That's the thing. I read these subs daily and for a while have been asking people  claiming the game is full of cheaters to drop demos or even a clip and maybe 1 out of 20 could.  

No one's saying it doesn't exist. It just doesn't seem as bad as people are saying it is. A lot of it is legit skill issue.  You can't deny that. No one's "sucking valves ass"  as much as yall suck ass at the game and need to blame "the cheaters"

It's sad
            Go to sub of different CS community and browse by videos, at least in this sub, 80% reports have videos. No leave that, go to YT and see pro players meeting a cheater every 3rd or 4th stream. No other community apart from CS cries about cheaters. 

Apart from that, I can DM you TG channels of 8 major cheat providers who have combined 300k active monthly paying users. They have Forums, Tickets, and moreover, it's cheap. $15 for cheat + 1 prime account. At Christmas, it was a cheat + 3 prime accounts. 

They have been in the business for 10+ years and their cheat works without any bans. So yea, cheating is a problem, no other game has this much level of support, I mean they are legitimately running a business with Twitter/Facebook accounts.

Edit: Most cheaters released CS2 working cheats even before the game officially launched, while Valorant's first internal cheat took 2
1.5 years to launch after release, and it goes offline every year after Valorant updates its minimum requirements of the Windows system. So yea, Vanguard works.
Game is working like dogshit, horrible update.
    Runs smooth for me. What is the matter?
        Lagging, feels like i have 60 fps while i have 250, dying behind the wall, etc
            I had the same issue, that it felt like having 60 fps while having 240hz monitor and 240+fps as well. The issue was, that in the cs2 settings, there was an option which was set on "60hz" instead of 240hz. Maybe you have the same issue.

Dying behind wall is still a noticable thing after the update? I have not played after the update yet, but would be sad.
                I haven't died behind a wall ever. It seems like people with ping above 60 run  into this problem.
                    I died quite few times behind a wall. Always having a ping from 5 to 20. But it was not that often, so was acceptable.
                        Hmm. Weird. Although that also happened in CSGO. I watched a video on it recently. You just didn't notice that because of the fade to black. Sadly just a part of online games.
                    I play on 10 ping, and it still happens to me...
                        same for me...
                    It got worse for me for some reason, especially against awp
                        Actually it also matters what ping your opponent has. I'll link a video if I find it about the peekers advantage.
Edit: found it: https://youtu.be/e4dQS8-9cLI?si=Tu3YrGcafEFOvO-R
                            Def matters what ping your opponent has. I‚Äôm curious if the edits to peeker advantage had any meaningful impact to this.
                                I have played the game the whole day today and can say with certainty that it did. Now someone run peeking you is no longer a death sentence, just a hard fight like it's supposed to be. It feels better at the very least.
                    I could be wrong but from my understanding this actually happens when you die to someone with high ping. It‚Äôs called lag comp otherwise the higher ping player would never kill anything ever. 

In a scenario where you have 10 ping and the enemy has 80, when you peek, miss shots, don‚Äôt kill them, but they hit their shots, then you will likely die after you‚Äôve moved and returned to cover. 

The game‚Äôs server to client will look at all the data, checking the lower ping player‚Äôs information first since it was received faster, and once it confirms the lower ping player didn‚Äôt kill the other player, it will check the higher ping players data to see what they did, and when it sees the higher ping player actually did hit their shots, it will register the kill(often after the lower ping player moved away).
                    I set my max ping to 80 in csgo and still enjoyed it till the last day. Now with that limit set to 60 but it was impossible to bother playing seriously.
                    I‚Äôm not one to complain about cheating or anything in the game really, but I have died behind a wall a few times recently and my ping is typically single digit. I haven‚Äôt played today since the update released, but I‚Äôm curious if the changes to peeler‚Äôs advantage will have any positive impact.
                    With the way cs2 works you don't even need to have high ping yourself, if you have low ping but enemy shooting at you has high ping, whole encounter is gonna play out with his ping. 
So yeah, nothing he could do about it
            skill issue
    Horrible? No, but I have noticed a bit of a frame drop in the latest update and it might feel worse for others, in arms race the servers were fucked and lots of people in one area def made it drop harder.
![img](avatar_exp|108870655|bravo)
Honestly could care less about cheaters and the new case. Where is the left hand models toggle
Peace out. It‚Äôs never enough. You guys will ALWAYS find something to bitch about. Bite the hand that feeds. Have fun in your beta echo chamber.
    wah wah wah people wont stop complaining about cs2 being infested with cheaters (when it obviously is) wah wah wah.
        It's not really that people won't stop complaining about cheaters. It's just that lack of content was number 1 on many people's criticism list and yet nobody seems even remotely happy that they finally got some new content. Not even a "hey look they are doing something with the game" it's just a bit silly.
They won't ban cheater as it is their source of income for every new prime player that cheats
Why didn't Valve click their giant, big red button that says "Ban all cheaters"  this patch?
Let's make gambling a part of the lives of the 13 year olds playing this game. Yeaaaa. Gabe the god. All hail. Bla bla. Fuck that fat fuck
    Sounds like a parenting issue
        Both could be true???
            Games rated as mature. Theoretically no one under 18 should be playing if parents paid attention to what their crotch goblins are doing
Banning cheaters won't make them goldsteins :(
If they made changes to the anti-cheat they wouldnt announce it unless necessary, so who knows.
about time the games playable for the most part now and cheaters are in maybe 10-15% of matches in most elos. we‚Äôve not had new skins for like a year
CS2 doesn't have a big cheating problem. You should try Cheaters Heaven (PUBG) and discuss later :)
I just got a note that someone I played with was perma banned for cheating and my rank took a hit as a penalty.. yikes..
    So you think you should keep the elo you got from playing with a cheater? You see nothing wrong with that?
        As if I knew. I'm not really pissed just crazy it finally happened and I'm getting dinged..
            Why would it matter if you knew because you know now? You didn‚Äôt win fair and square and that can‚Äôt be changed.
                Yes, understood. Just saying they could change the message. From a cheater on your team hence you're penalized to... A cheater found in a game you played, match cancelled and will not impact any participants rank. If we won, penalized means I lose the elo, if we lost what does penalized mean? I lost elo and it stays lost?

I don't know what game, what was the result, etc. Just that anyone that guy played with was penalized.. 

I'm 100% there needs to be a cheater resolution but just cancel the match. Don't attack those who could possibly have no control. 

It's not like reporting a player does anything. If it did, would anything change if I reported and later they were found to be cheating? No.

KISS. Just cancel cheater matches, ban the cheater, done. If people are getting carried by cheaters but not cheating, at some point they'll get smashed back to low elo if they are terrible, it works itself out.
    Same thing happened with me. My friend was perm banned (wrongly) and all of us got our ranks taken and lost like 5k Elo. He got unbanned and our ranks never got reset back to what they were.
you forgot new sticker system, nice nazi symbol you got there
They should add Skibidi Toilet stickers as well as adding Skibidi Toilets behind doors that should have bathrooms but currently have nothing behind them.
It's almost like it's 2 different departments & workers with different talents & skillsets working for completely different things
Why remove cheaters when you can let CTs in real life cheat their way to competition right next to a real life T? Valve out here helping people with their careers and tackling terrorism at the same time.
And more sussy stickers
    And Zeus skins
        And chicken skins
            Are we forgetting about the release of the grenade skins?
So‚Ä¶how much money does it take? Valve is a billion $ corporation.
Same brother I just put 4 lenticulars on a FN headshot 2 days ago.
Somebody applied a 2014 kato ibp paper to a panthera onca an hour before the update. So it could be worse.
I applied 130$ mlg holos night before.
I saw the n word on an AK

But what does this have to do with gameplay?
    Oh nothing at all, games rough BUT, the stickers üòçüòçüòç
        Why not just go buy some stickers at your local gas station if that‚Äôs your thing?

So yea, everything is fine, VAC is not updated, don't suck Valve's Ass, they are focused on cases and earning money.
            Thanks for that info.
Im at 100% Trust, on faceitfinder, have over 6k games and medals since 2014, 
Been getting cheaters every game, on team and enemy team, 
Its not about trust atp lol
    Same but i nearly never see a cheater.
Clown take
    I'd probably agree if I haven't been called a hacker at least once a week in Counter-Strike for the last 20 years.

Figure it the fuck out.
        Dude got called a cheater in a casual at 3am on a weekday and has been riding the high ever since.
            Shit predates "casual matchmaking" and even Steam. Got an aerodynamic brain, huh?
                Oh thank God you replied, my side of fries have literally ZERO salt on them. Cheers.
                    Bruh, for fuck's sake. Sit down, nerd.
                        I am? You think I eat standing up? Tf man
                            So dumb.  Have fun throwing rocks at trees or whatever.
                                damn both yall need to shut up
        Ik you ain‚Äôt talking to me saying figure it tf out I‚Äôm 20k rating
            Is that the new "I'm CAL-I"?
    At least I'm not playing and complaining about a game that I seemingly despise.  Like the lot of you.  ü§°
Sounds like a typical hacker pushing their agenda.
    Yes. I hack on a 17 year old account with 425 games and $2k worth of cs skins. Fucking scrub
        cope harder poorcel
Until I meet a blatant Aim Botter who is killing the whole team while bunny jumping, or instances where the game becomes HvH. Bro, if you don't play in Eastern European or Singaporean servers, it's not my mistake that you are not facing cheaters. Shit is bad in these servers and cheaters are blatant. 

It feels weird when people ignore legitimate videos and go on sucking Valve's ass just because their region has less cheaters.
    That's the thing. I read these subs daily and for a while have been asking people  claiming the game is full of cheaters to drop demos or even a clip and maybe 1 out of 20 could.  

No one's saying it doesn't exist. It just doesn't seem as bad as people are saying it is. A lot of it is legit skill issue.  You can't deny that. No one's "sucking valves ass"  as much as yall suck ass at the game and need to blame "the cheaters"

It's sad
        Go to sub of different CS community and browse by videos, at least in this sub, 80% reports have videos. No leave that, go to YT and see pro players meeting a cheater every 3rd or 4th stream. No other community apart from CS cries about cheaters. 

Apart from that, I can DM you TG channels of 8 major cheat providers who have combined 300k active monthly paying users. They have Forums, Tickets, and moreover, it's cheap. $15 for cheat + 1 prime account. At Christmas, it was a cheat + 3 prime accounts. 

They have been in the business for 10+ years and their cheat works without any bans. So yea, cheating is a problem, no other game has this much level of support, I mean they are legitimately running a business with Twitter/Facebook accounts.

Edit: Most cheaters released CS2 working cheats even before the game officially launched, while Valorant's first internal cheat took 2
1.5 years to launch after release, and it goes offline every year after Valorant updates its minimum requirements of the Windows system. So yea, Vanguard works.
Runs smooth for me. What is the matter?
    Lagging, feels like i have 60 fps while i have 250, dying behind the wall, etc
        I had the same issue, that it felt like having 60 fps while having 240hz monitor and 240+fps as well. The issue was, that in the cs2 settings, there was an option which was set on "60hz" instead of 240hz. Maybe you have the same issue.

Dying behind wall is still a noticable thing after the update? I have not played after the update yet, but would be sad.
            I haven't died behind a wall ever. It seems like people with ping above 60 run  into this problem.
                I died quite few times behind a wall. Always having a ping from 5 to 20. But it was not that often, so was acceptable.
                    Hmm. Weird. Although that also happened in CSGO. I watched a video on it recently. You just didn't notice that because of the fade to black. Sadly just a part of online games.
                I play on 10 ping, and it still happens to me...
                    same for me...
                It got worse for me for some reason, especially against awp
                    Actually it also matters what ping your opponent has. I'll link a video if I find it about the peekers advantage.
Edit: found it: https://youtu.be/e4dQS8-9cLI?si=Tu3YrGcafEFOvO-R
                        Def matters what ping your opponent has. I‚Äôm curious if the edits to peeker advantage had any meaningful impact to this.
                            I have played the game the whole day today and can say with certainty that it did. Now someone run peeking you is no longer a death sentence, just a hard fight like it's supposed to be. It feels better at the very least.
                I could be wrong but from my understanding this actually happens when you die to someone with high ping. It‚Äôs called lag comp otherwise the higher ping player would never kill anything ever. 

In a scenario where you have 10 ping and the enemy has 80, when you peek, miss shots, don‚Äôt kill them, but they hit their shots, then you will likely die after you‚Äôve moved and returned to cover. 

The game‚Äôs server to client will look at all the data, checking the lower ping player‚Äôs information first since it was received faster, and once it confirms the lower ping player didn‚Äôt kill the other player, it will check the higher ping players data to see what they did, and when it sees the higher ping player actually did hit their shots, it will register the kill(often after the lower ping player moved away).
                I set my max ping to 80 in csgo and still enjoyed it till the last day. Now with that limit set to 60 but it was impossible to bother playing seriously.
                I‚Äôm not one to complain about cheating or anything in the game really, but I have died behind a wall a few times recently and my ping is typically single digit. I haven‚Äôt played today since the update released, but I‚Äôm curious if the changes to peeler‚Äôs advantage will have any positive impact.
                With the way cs2 works you don't even need to have high ping yourself, if you have low ping but enemy shooting at you has high ping, whole encounter is gonna play out with his ping. 
So yeah, nothing he could do about it
        skill issue
Horrible? No, but I have noticed a bit of a frame drop in the latest update and it might feel worse for others, in arms race the servers were fucked and lots of people in one area def made it drop harder.
wah wah wah people wont stop complaining about cs2 being infested with cheaters (when it obviously is) wah wah wah.
    It's not really that people won't stop complaining about cheaters. It's just that lack of content was number 1 on many people's criticism list and yet nobody seems even remotely happy that they finally got some new content. Not even a "hey look they are doing something with the game" it's just a bit silly.
Sounds like a parenting issue
    Both could be true???
        Games rated as mature. Theoretically no one under 18 should be playing if parents paid attention to what their crotch goblins are doing
So you think you should keep the elo you got from playing with a cheater? You see nothing wrong with that?
    As if I knew. I'm not really pissed just crazy it finally happened and I'm getting dinged..
        Why would it matter if you knew because you know now? You didn‚Äôt win fair and square and that can‚Äôt be changed.
            Yes, understood. Just saying they could change the message. From a cheater on your team hence you're penalized to... A cheater found in a game you played, match cancelled and will not impact any participants rank. If we won, penalized means I lose the elo, if we lost what does penalized mean? I lost elo and it stays lost?

I don't know what game, what was the result, etc. Just that anyone that guy played with was penalized.. 

I'm 100% there needs to be a cheater resolution but just cancel the match. Don't attack those who could possibly have no control. 

It's not like reporting a player does anything. If it did, would anything change if I reported and later they were found to be cheating? No.

KISS. Just cancel cheater matches, ban the cheater, done. If people are getting carried by cheaters but not cheating, at some point they'll get smashed back to low elo if they are terrible, it works itself out.
Same thing happened with me. My friend was perm banned (wrongly) and all of us got our ranks taken and lost like 5k Elo. He got unbanned and our ranks never got reset back to what they were.
And Zeus skins
    And chicken skins
        Are we forgetting about the release of the grenade skins?
That build was also possible before the update FYI
I saw the Zeus skin where a Greek god shags... Well see for yourself, this is clearly NSFW:D
Oh nothing at all, games rough BUT, the stickers üòçüòçüòç
    Why not just go buy some stickers at your local gas station if that‚Äôs your thing?
        Cause I can't get epic stickers to go on my ak47 like I can in sounter crike
            Yes you can, I spent a few seconds on Google and found this. 

https://gunwraps.com/collections/ak-47-gun-skin-vinyl-wraps
                Unironically I love some of those. Thank you for the link
didn't you know? a good skin can improve your aim up to 30%!
    it‚Äôs 50% on awp iirc, add in a decent knife to switch to and you won‚Äôt have to train ever again
Aye man I play just to see my pretty sticker crafts and skins
I‚Äôve played a lot of Val and as far as combating cheating they‚Äôre the best at it. However I don‚Äôt enjoy the agent aspect of Val. I like that everyone has the same utility and no one gets ultimates. Maybe I will go back to Val just to avoid so much cheating on cs2.
    If they added extra mode where no custom agents skills are there, they would see lot of people trying the game
Do you realize how much money they make a month off of case openings alone? Valve will be just fine when it comes to money. And that‚Äôs just case openings and not how much they make selling other peoples games on steam.
    I know, but if they ban a metric ton of the player base, how would that affect their  earnings? Their reputation? The implications of banning so many people? Not to mention how much they would need to invest into an effective anti cheat solution. Why do you think these things aren't connected? 

Running a business is not that simple and there's many things to consider before making huge decisions like these.
        To add to this they didn't just ruin the reputation of one game, CS:GO is gone forever. They've probably destroyed a whole franchise tbh. With all the money they could pour into this they could make a whole entire new esport. It was borderline on that level in esports before this debacle. They will just stay where they were a little before CS2, an old game still running on old box sales for some reason being completely forgetten about. CS2 is not a new game it's just a heavy upgrade with many negative side effects.
        Their reputation? For banning cheaters? It would be a great thing‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ they make so much fucking money they wouldn‚Äôt be affected as much as you think.
I‚Äôve done many LAN parties and they are a blast. I‚Äôm older now and it‚Äôs not for me anymore.
No, it definitely did get worse. However, enabling streamlined ptt in audio fixed it for me.
![gif](giphy|K0Hy2NwI8IXZK)
Uh yes it is lol
How to say you‚Äôre low elo without saying you‚Äôre low elo.
    16.6k 
wouldn‚Äôt say that‚Äôs low, wouldn‚Äôt say that‚Äôs high
        The cheaters are mainly at 20k+.
            That‚Äôs about 0.2% of the playerbase according to leetify.  Which means the vast majority of players aren‚Äôt encountering cheaters
                Cs2 leaderboard says that 20k is around top 2-3%. You‚Äôre right, most players arent encountering them. However, that top tier is unplayable.
downvoted to hell for telling the truth, i've not seen a single cheater since last vac wave lol

on the other hand, almost everygame enemies cry about wh and aimbot, when i know my team is legit, hmm how comes
I never said my teammates didn't. Just not that game

Just last game today reported chinese teammate with 300 hours. He was doing super sus plays and was CONSTANTLY playing with bison. 
Thats in a lobby where everyone else had 2000 hours at least, 1 guy 7500, and one guy 12000 hours.

I haven‚Äôt played today since the update released, but I‚Äôm curious if the changes to peeler‚Äôs advantage will have any positive impact.
        With the way cs2 works you don't even need to have high ping yourself, if you have low ping but enemy shooting at you has high ping, whole encounter is gonna play out with his ping. 
So yeah, nothing he could do about it
skill issue
Games rated as mature. Theoretically no one under 18 should be playing if parents paid attention to what their crotch goblins are doing
Why would it matter if you knew because you know now? You didn‚Äôt win fair and square and that can‚Äôt be changed.
    Yes, understood. Just saying they could change the message. From a cheater on your team hence you're penalized to... A cheater found in a game you played, match cancelled and will not impact any participants rank. If we won, penalized means I lose the elo, if we lost what does penalized mean? I lost elo and it stays lost?

I don't know what game, what was the result, etc. Just that anyone that guy played with was penalized.. 

I'm 100% there needs to be a cheater resolution but just cancel the match. Don't attack those who could possibly have no control. 

It's not like reporting a player does anything. If it did, would anything change if I reported and later they were found to be cheating? No.

KISS. Just cancel cheater matches, ban the cheater, done. If people are getting carried by cheaters but not cheating, at some point they'll get smashed back to low elo if they are terrible, it works itself out.
Are we forgetting about the release of the grenade skins?
Cause I can't get epic stickers to go on my ak47 like I can in sounter crike
    Yes you can, I spent a few seconds on Google and found this.

        Unironically I love some of those. Thank you for the link
To add to this they didn't just ruin the reputation of one game, CS:GO is gone forever. They've probably destroyed a whole franchise tbh. With all the money they could pour into this they could make a whole entire new esport. It was borderline on that level in esports before this debacle. They will just stay where they were a little before CS2, an old game still running on old box sales for some reason being completely forgetten about. CS2 is not a new game it's just a heavy upgrade with many negative side effects.
Their reputation? For banning cheaters? It would be a great thing‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ they make so much fucking money they wouldn‚Äôt be affected as much as you think.
The cheaters are mainly at 20k+.
    That‚Äôs about 0.2% of the playerbase according to leetify.  Which means the vast majority of players aren‚Äôt encountering cheaters
        Cs2 leaderboard says that 20k is around top 2-3%. You‚Äôre right, most players arent encountering them. However, that top tier is unplayable.
Thanks for that info.
Shit predates "casual matchmaking" and even Steam. Got an aerodynamic brain, huh?
    Oh thank God you replied, my side of fries have literally ZERO salt on them. Cheers.
        Bruh, for fuck's sake. Sit down, nerd.
            I am? You think I eat standing up? Tf man
                So dumb.  Have fun throwing rocks at trees or whatever.
                    damn both yall need to shut up
Is that the new "I'm CAL-I"?
I haven't died behind a wall ever. It seems like people with ping above 60 run  into this problem.
    I died quite few times behind a wall. Always having a ping from 5 to 20. But it was not that often, so was acceptable.
        Hmm. Weird. Although that also happened in CSGO. I watched a video on it recently. You just didn't notice that because of the fade to black. Sadly just a part of online games.
    I play on 10 ping, and it still happens to me...
        same for me...
    It got worse for me for some reason, especially against awp
        Actually it also matters what ping your opponent has. I'll link a video if I find it about the peekers advantage.

            Def matters what ping your opponent has. I‚Äôm curious if the edits to peeker advantage had any meaningful impact to this.
                I have played the game the whole day today and can say with certainty that it did. Now someone run peeking you is no longer a death sentence, just a hard fight like it's supposed to be. It feels better at the very least.
    I could be wrong but from my understanding this actually happens when you die to someone with high ping. It‚Äôs called lag comp otherwise the higher ping player would never kill anything ever. 

In a scenario where you have 10 ping and the enemy has 80, when you peek, miss shots, don‚Äôt kill them, but they hit their shots, then you will likely die after you‚Äôve moved and returned to cover. 

The game‚Äôs server to client will look at all the data, checking the lower ping player‚Äôs information first since it was received faster, and once it confirms the lower ping player didn‚Äôt kill the other player, it will check the higher ping players data to see what they did, and when it sees the higher ping player actually did hit their shots, it will register the kill(often after the lower ping player moved away).
