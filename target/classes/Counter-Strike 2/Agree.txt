[[Agree]]





Correct, you make yourself the bait for the advantage of the team.
    and then being called the noob after the person who always baits the team starts to lose
    I love that job, rushing mindlessly jumping everywhere lol just to get a kill and die, then watch my pro teammates  do the job.
    Yeah and your 4 randoms just do nothing and let you die and keep camping spawn since they're too busy hiding their wallhack and aimbot.

It's hilarious how out of touch people are, do you even play the game?
    When I was soling matchmaking I found being able to entry AND trade yourself usually won games. 

Entry and lurk, but you need an entry so pick that shit up
I'm always the first onto the site. My problem is that no one else backs me up, so I run up banana, molly car, deep nade, flashbang, smoke CT, clear sandbags, enter site, get the kill on one of them, then I look at map, and the team is sitting at car waiting for better times.  


Only about 10% of the times I do this, do I get the backup needed.
    This is why you constantly yell DONT STOP DONT STOP while you are first pushing. Assuming you a comming
    As the entry fragger I feel this. And then if I don’t entry nobody does lmao
        Lol yeah. 4 guys waiting down the clock cuz you died and CTs don't rush...

        Love having a negative k/d cause nobody else will entry then the guy who gets 2 kills a round off your bait calls you bad.
    Don't worry, they'll balance it out by pushing alone every round on CT side
    Accurate post
    It's infuriating lmao. You need to clear sites alone before they go haha
        You can't even leave one guy with half hp. It's so annoying they are all afraid to finish a trade-kill when the team outnumbers the guy numerically and firepower wise
    it'd worse whenever I nade smokes to get a clearing for us to rush. I always say like 5 seconds before, rush in expecting help, and then get shot and they have not moved. the smoke just returns to normal. wtf
    Ppl dont know what a refrag is and die one by one
    What in reality happened when I do that : Molly car > get double naded + perfect blank, dead > my team run back to T stairs
True, though I wouldn’t flame anyone. Makes games less fun

Being the First guy out, is non stop running and even jumping corners and angles to mess with the enemy aim even further
    The one that makes me flame is when you stop the play.

Example: t side rush b on d2. Run run run and in the tunnel guy in front is in the center and puts the brakes at the first sign of a flash.

And then you are stuck in no mans land and get mowed down by the lone ct in the b site.
    Makes you loose, not just less fun.
This is especially true on pistols. If you're the first guy in on pistol I want you grooving into site at 240mph strafing, jumping, twisting in circles etc to drag the defenders aim to your goofy looking ass while everyone else gets frags
    It’s especially true always
If I'm rushing B and the enemy drops a molly, the 2nd person behind me better drop a smoke on that bitch because I'm not stopping.

If I run into site alone and die. I'll make sure to report whoever was behind me and pussied out.

Fair is fair
    Report? Lol
        It's as fair as reporting the entry for stopping
    Report if you want, but running into a Molly is your fault when you don't make sure the person behind you smokes.
    only that the report doesnt have too much effect
Yeah but then my KD goes down and that's more important than winning the round
    Yeah how am I supposed to get my UAV or care package if I am dead
        Wrong game, bud

    So I can blame my 7-19 teammate for not being able to frag and being useless
If your spawn means you’re first on site in a rush, then go crazy and do whatever damage or distract as you can. Or chicken out at the last second so the one guy covering B gets to kill the entire traffic jam with one magazine.
The whole flaming, reporting, and bullying them over a video game is toxic af and embarrassing. This guy is a grown man with a beard getting bent out of shape over random people playing a video game. Go bully NPC’s in a singleplayer game if you can’t help but throw a tantrum because your teammate made a mistake. Btw, you got matchmade with him, he’s at your skill level. If this micro play makes them trash then you should be way above his skill level before you know it. (but you won’t be because you’re just as “trash” as your team)

Quit normalizing the toxicity, its gross.
    Thank you for saying this, I was thinking the same fucking thing, so many toxic idiots in that game, I think they need to be put into a mental institution.  


I play this game like once a month, and sometimes when I get rusty I get some idiot telling me that I am good for nothing trash. Some idiot, that spends 24/7 playing this game, while I have a life lol.
That’s why my k/d is so bad, I’m just the “make some space” guy
"I will report you" LMAO. "Yeah, this guy stopped for a sec on the way to B, when we verbally agreed no stop to rush B."
Rush B dont stop strats have about a 20% winrate
    90% if you don't stop.
he will do everything- except iron his shirt or fold his laundry when its fresh out the dryer
Why have to be mad ? Its only a game.
    He's an immature idiot. Probably started playing cs when he was in 5th grade and haven't been developing mentally since then. Didn't get a higher education, etc. His entire life he's been in the environment full of toxic idiots in cs.
True, I do not agree about the flaming part but I get the frustration with players who lead and then pause and screws up a great rush as happens SO OFTEN...
Stopping, means getting everyone clumping up, and sets you up for failure
Its only game chill
    Everyone dying in tuns because the offering (first man) got cold feet is a bad strat.
        I know how stupid it is but i know worse. People lost their manner and i feel like people doesnt having fun playing games. So next time if an idiot stops front of you dont scream to him. Talk nicely and try to have fun.

What i actually mean is there is a lot of shit going on at our lifes. Main reason we are here is having fun. Dont let small things make you angry.
            Holy shit, no doubt! Do you know how often people want to kill other people on the highway when we’re all driving in the same direction? And this is a game. And games are supposed to be fun. But if you can dox a fella and then burn his house down for fucking up a “RASH B” then that seems appropriate.
                I dont know if its just me but i feel like people are unhappier. Maybe its just my memories but i remember like 10 years ago community was more excited and talkative. Its still better than league tho.
                    I so so so badly miss all chat during half time, everyone would fucking rage at eachother and talk shit about their teammates to the enemy team or just flame someone for like ten seconds & the chaos was so funny
                        I would give one leg for it 🤣
            > Talk nicely and try to have fun.

We were down 0:4 on Ancient yesterday. Orange says "at least it'll be quick" and stops trying. Just doing the most random shit and not caring about the tactics. Meanwhile Purple goes "okay guys. my english is shit" and then proceeds to IGL us to 9:13 against a much better team. We didn't win but we had fun and everyone was just happy to hang out for a short while. Reminded me why I love playing the game.
This is so fucking real! Hate the twats NEVER crating space. 

On the other hand when you go first and get killed without teammates backing you up, that shit hurts just the same.
And then I get to watch a zero communication Russian player walk save 1v5 6 rounds in a row to eek out a 1.1 KD for himself
    Yep, that's a smart thing to do, props to the Russian player.
FOLLOW ME IN THEN YA HYUCKHYUCK GOOFY, I ALREADY KILLED 3
Amen!
Well said, people hate being bait but in reality it's all just part of the game. Very well said my brother.
Thats why 3rd guy mollys tetris so first guy can't camp there.
i hate when the first player somehow magically ends up in the back of the rush
For me the most frustrating thing that's been happening to me since cs2 is that we rush a site and make SO much noise, then only I go out and everyone are cowering behind cover so of course I get shot from multiple angles. Then their whole team rotates and pick us off one by one. Maybe even rush behind us because they take so long standing in one place.
This is why mirage bucks. Everyone always sits in apts rather than pushing onto site
"I've got a smoke for the molly", this one line in csgo gave me trust issues lol
First guy guns out. Second guy guns out. Third guy smoke out. Fourth guy flashes. 

'Hold W peeps let's be confident'
If you stop and block the team it’s an immediate TK, they never do it again afterwards.

tip: +forward in console in rush rounds. never stop never surrender
The people behind better set up some util then.
mb guys i stopped to tie my shoes in the doorway
Yup
My w key is yours
What if I get scared ;(
So is this only pertaining to rushing A site or do the same laws apply on B site rushes as well?
Biggest losers play cs
    Who
This is the way.
Flaming assholes are the worst players in the team.

You win 8 rounds and one guy starts flaming because of one little fault, in the end you will loose anyways. Because the flamer spoils the match.
    The guy who stopped definitely made a mistake, but flaming almost guarantees an L
Iv never wanted to punch someone in the face so fast.
I agree but this exaggerated drama is stupid.
Your job is to throw a good flash that doesn't blind everyone behind you and try to get one good kill or some info, then die.
No, the first guy is still trying to get an entry kill but secondary yes get in and create space, die for a trade kill.
Player sacrafice anyone?
What a moronic idiot that takes this dumb game too seriously.
Some people are weird [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNSeB\_PQPoo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnseb_pqpoo)
Yeah I'll just kill them ngl
