[[Alan Wake 2 is one of the best games i ever played]]


I finished the game 2 days ago and im still blown away how amazing it was , never had this feeling in no AAA game ever . Remedy put their heart and love to this game  how detailed it is , the storytelling , audio / music .  Not to mention that the game has  mini short movies and a Musical in it !  


It thoroughly helped me get past my “addiction” of games. I realized that high i was chasing in other games simply wouldn’t ever be found after played AW2, it’s just entirely raised the bar to a whole new level that’s almost laughable
    Not many game studios make games like them .... its like reading an amazing book
    As someone who's played games obsessively my entire life and very rarely ever got bored of them, AW2 left me dissatisfied with everything too after.  Like I subconsciously expected a similar level of plot and presentation even if a game barely has any plot at all lol.
    it's okay at best. Madison is much better Imo. 
    It’s hard going from 12/10 to just “okay” games. I played BG3 and then went into Starfield, it was hard to see how shitty everything looked, and how much lower quality animations were in general in comparison. I know Bethesda isn’t known for cutting edge animation or anything, but it was still sad. At least Lies of P is actually cutting edge, but AW2 takes the cake for best immersion and environments in any game I’ve seen so far.
        Definitely, yesterday i bought  AC Mirage on Epic  just for like 32 $ ,  the Face models look horrible :D    AW2 is the true next gen game  and its gonna change the game history  because  other games are gonna take inspiration from the Graphics etc
    This bro... And funnily enough that happens every single time Rockstar drops a game too.. make's sense why Rockstar decided to work with Remedy over the years! They just built different
Absolutely man. One of the best experiences i had in years. It was extremely satisfying as a long Remedy fan (Remedy fan since age of 11), It was extremely satisfying as a survival horror fan, and it was extremely satisfying as a Silent Hill fan.
    Yessir ! and we are gonna get 2 Story DLC   super excited !
        I think one of the DLC is not story related, but you’re actually playing through episodes of Night Springs as different characters. Don’t quote me on that. However, the DLC idea had to be damn good for me to be satisified with it being unrelated to the main story and they STILL pull it off.
            That's still story related. Door will be the host for one thing and Alan likely will be present. Check out  a video of the last convo Door has with Alan.
                I just checked it out - good catch!
                I’ll have to check out
            Night Springs DLC will be really fun and weird, I'm sure, but it will also be story related for sure. Especially considering that >!Night Springs is FBC propaganda!<
                Yeah, I understand, by story related - I meant more directly connected to Alan Wake or Saga - not the whole AW / Control / FBC lore - though I could still be wrong anyway. Especially if, as someone else said - we could be playing as characters like the brothers
                    >we could be playing as characters like the brothers

Let's hope so
            I think we are gonna see more of Ilmo  and his brother
        Hell yeah!
I only played control a year ago and didn't know it was connected to other Games. Then they released alan wake 1 remastered for free and I was like "oh this is related to control" and then I beat that and alan wake 2 came out like 2 months later. I dont know how anyone waited 13 years lol
    You should also try Quantum Break as well. It’s connected to Control.
        So I knew Tim breaker was a Quantum Break reference but the nuance of it was lost on me.  Tim breaker = Time breaker = fractured time.  And the surname Breaker being a reference to Quantum break as well. 
        I need to fix my gaming pc but 100% when I do I will. I think that one isn't on PS5 lamely
            It was an Xbox exclusive with a last minute PC port. From what I hear thr PC port is problematic. If you need to sink money into you pc to get it going it may be a better invedent - depending on how badly you want to play QB - to find a last Gen Xbox instead on ebay or at Gamestop.
                Maybe lol but I want the computer anyways because I really wanna play prison architect and make the prisoners shower for 10 hours a day again. Before it broke I had over 4000 bodies still not removed from my prison.

I want clean body rehab back lol
    Control is in my top five favorite games of all time at number five. Alan wake 2 has taken up the 2 spot now. I love control. I love the flying the throwing concrete at a guy while shooting another and then the guy who I was mind controlling blows up and kills like 3 guys. Control is an amazing game and so is Alan wake 2. And now remedy is up there with square and Capcom.
I can’t sing it’s praises enough - that game is a full on experience. The musical was something else.
    The Old Gods of Asgard are gonna rock your socks off !
Alan Wake 2 has officially topped RE4/RE7 as my favorite horror game and that is saying something seeing as I've platinumed both with well over 400 hours of gameplay combined. Remedy seriously made an incredible and special experience with this game.
    i couldnt believe how scary it was at times.  I dont scare easily, and it really got me.  I didnt appreciate the jump scares though, because i felt the game was organically scary enough already.
    Interesting as RE4/RE7 are my favourites by far. Might have to pull the trigger on this game today after reading your experience with it. Cheers!
        I just got it as it is on sale in the Epic Games store. Pick it up!
        literally have re4 for ps5 still sealed since i was taking my time with alan wake lmao
        I'm starting it now.  Only very early in. I like to play horror games late at night only so it might take me awhile to chip away at it. Excited you liked it cause RE7 is one of my favorites too.
I finished it a few days ago, and I'm still thinking about it. I cannot wait for NG+!
Very magical game that’s for sure
To me, this game and dead space remake are two examples of "perfect" games. I love horror, I love scifi, and I love books about those things. Alan Wake 2 scratches all of those itches, and topped dead space remake as my favorite game the last few years. I tried to take it slow as hell just because I was dreading the experience ending. Really excited to play ng+ but I'll be damnded if it didn't make going back to my backlog of other games seem super depressing knowing nothing will top that experience.
I agree! It’s one of the best games I’ve played in years
It was really good. Gameplay needs a lot of work and I hope Remedy can significantly improve upon it, but the premise, music and overall aesthetic is top noth.
Yes, it's now among my top 5 fave horror games and it has been living rent free in my head the Iast 2 weeks or so. I clocked in at 30 hours, so I got some bang for my buck!
100% agree, it is the best game ever. I played a lot of great games in the last years though. Not sure how people say there are no good games anymore nowadays...
Agreed, I am constantly thinking when I play it, "Wow- this is one of the best games I've ever played." 

It turned me from a casual Remedy enjoyer to a Remedy superfan now. I'm going back and playing Remedy games I haven't played before, while I wait for AW2 DLC, Control 2, and whatever else is coming... I'm on board
I had to hop in here just to say, I’ve always enjoyed Remedy games especially control. I was expecting to like AW2 but it’s firmly cemented itself as my favourite game full stop, it’s exactly my kind of weird and it’s inspired by so many things I enjoy. Just hope more and more people give it a shot and really experience the unique story/presentation it offers. Can’t wait for the DLC!
i want to love theses games but they just dont click with me... its a great game no doubt. i just dont think its one of the best games ever tho.  everyone has their preference. As of right now my favorite all time game is probably witcher 3. I think its just something about the style of remedy games that i just dont like. This is just my opinion, its purely subjective, to me these games have a sort of made for tv movie vibe, something i would find on the syfi channel. i dont know why i feel that way. i honestly like last of us part one more. kingdome come deliverance i liked more. rdr2. gta 5 i also liked more. Im gonna give the alan wake games another go tho. i stopped playing it like 3 hours in. same with the 1st one. i stopped playing it also around 3 hours in. I know i should like them. i like the story and setting, and graphics. on paper its my type of game, i prefer story driven games but it just didnt click with me for some weird reason.....im gona start over with the 1st remastered one
Is this the first Remedy game you’ve played? 
If you haven’t yet, you should also check out the likes of Control, Quantum Break, & the first Alan Wake along with its DLC. 

All of the mentioned games has the classic trademarks of a Remedy game.
    I played the original and American nightmare a loong time ago :D. Actually planning to buy the Remastered version  just to support Remedy
Agreed completely. Yes the gameplay is a bit repetitive but it is definitely like playing a movie/book where you are the hero(es). Narration and cinematography is on another level.

I rarely feel this strong about a game. It is by definition a piece of art in every aspect. I hope DLCs answer a lot of our questions and introduce a buck ton of other which will tie us to Control 2.
I wish I felt the same

I did enjoy it, though
I can't remember the last game I played that I was thoroughly engrossed at every point. Level after level, bangers.
Just discovered this thread after googling “Alan wake 2 is amazing”

I am really enjoying it! But man, the game is absolutely STUNNING. On a 4090, I find myself stopping just to look at stuff. Like the way the night’s moon reflects off lake water in the rain. I’ve never seen anything like it. Even down to your character’s breath in the flashlight that gets heavier as you run. It’s just astonishing.
    The classic confirmation bias
        Just wanted to talk about my experience with the game with others that also enjoyed it. I’m sure there are those that don’t like it, I wasn’t looking to form an opinion or learn about the game. Confirmation bias doesn’t apply here.

    It is a truly next gen game , its awesome !
Just finished the game tonight. Truly a rare experience in any medium, and I think just shot up into my top 10 games of all time. Wildly original, stunning visually, dripping with atmosphere, incredibly surreal, and genuinely had me on the edge of my seat for a majority of the game.

Is it 10/10 gameplay? No. But it's one of those games where the sum of its parts make a much greater total experience. 2023 has been a great year for games, but this was another level.
All the praise I am observing here is mostly abt 'looks' 'sound' 'story' ... as if describing a movie. Movies also create such emotional impacts..

What about the 'gameplay' .. 'enemy AI' .. 'wide open level design' ? What about how is "Plays" ??
    Who cares? The story is the important part of a story based game. Gameplay doesn’t matter a whole lot
        agreed as subjective...its a 'part' but in the end its a video game...it must play well along with the story component going well too
Oh yeah, as of now this one of the best games I've ever played. And that folks say BG3 is comparable if not better (in quality, BG3 is def not a horror game lol) has me so hyped to try BG3
Agreed! Looking forward to Alan Wake 3.
I’m about 3/4 the way through and I am totally sucked in.  It’s fantastic and I love it.  Every time I fire the game up there goes several hours. lol.
Do I need to play the first before playing 2?
    To understand AW2 i would say  yes .  The first AW has pretty cheap price also, bang for your buck
    Yes
    Watching a story recap video will suffice. I beat the game 12 years ago so I just watched a recap video before playing 2.
first time in a long time i did not feel bored during a gameplay , this game is masterpiece , sadly i do not see many people talking about it
agreed, the franchise is for sure top 10 below the witcher tho
    Imo, it tops witcher
        lol nah, witcher 3 especially was a masterpiece
It isn't bad but far from great. 6-7/10
Alan Wake 2 is a masterpiece.  It brings to mind old-school horror classics like Silent Hill.   It totally made my New Year's!  First off, the characters are magical contemporary paragons.  It uses them to explore social issues so tacitly that you feel a familial warmth from this deep psychological probe.  The settings are extremely well done as well.  As Alan, you wander a nightmare scape NY filled with evidence of long abandoned civility.  It's antique elegance given way to vandalism.  As Saga,  you journey to rural Bright Falls,  a township that is painted well with realism.  It's many characters full of affectionate details serving you delicious laughter. It walks the tightrope between blatant fantasy and alternate paradigm. It evens pulls off a corny musical number as a zombie shooter!  Razor-sharp.  It was between this and reading a Lee Child's novel.
The way music was implemented in the game i had never seen before it is beyond surreal 8/10 for me i legit have the music on repeat.
So I am an EXTREME beginner at gaming, at 34 years old 😅 this thread popped up after I googled "Alan wake 2 best game". My boyfriend got this as a free download with a new laptop, and read the premise of it being a sci-fi/murder storyline and thought it would be right up my alley. He was right. I suck at shooting things so I played the "story" version, and there's still some parts I have gotten frustrated at. I have no idea how far I am through the game, but after reading some logged 20+ hours I'm nowhere near that point. I just got to where I can switch realities, and finished the musical part of initiation 4. I am taking it super slow because as I've read, it's gonna be hard to top this as a beginner, however, any recommendations for when I do?? TIA
Control was my gateway to Remedy’s world. I couldn’t wait for their next title and bought the PS5 only to play AW2 after all the promising reviews. I’m in the middle of playing it at the moment, and I can’t describe how unique and engaging this experience is. I usually try not to hype up movies or shows too much. High expectations can too often be a disservice. However, in this case, I can freely share my excitement. Any kind of praise, even the most  outrageously biased, can not possibly do it justice.
How gory is it? I don’t do well with that kind of stuff, and I went through the opening and decided to put it down because it made me feel sick. Is that the worst it gets does it get less violent or more? I know this sounds dumb, I’m just kind of a weenie when it comes to this stuff. 
    I hear this the first time  not gonna lie ,  Alan Wake is kind of gory per SE  but most videogames are , its no biggie
I’ve played virtually every game of importance since the late 90s and whilst I’ll always have my favourites I have to admit Alan Wake 2 just blew me away. What an amazing game.
    Haven't been this blown away by a game since RDR2
Remedy never misses, its really the only real Dev that is remotely comparable to Rockstar Games, not fukin Naughty Dog. If its not Remedy, its Rockstar, if its not Rockstar, its Remedy. Both these dev companies learn a lot from each other and it shows with the quality of their video games! Still cant wait for the Max Payne remake on the Northlight Engine, 🔥🔥🔥its gonna look insane!!
I just came here to throw in my two cents that nobody asked for:

I love this game so much. I've cried while playing this game, just being thankful to be alive to experience such a masterpiece.

Now I'm scared that I'll die before I get to play Remedy's next game.
Alan Wake 2 is just incredible, it’s story it’s graphics and the environment design is all just so good, and the fact that they fit live action so perfectly without it feeling jarring is just amazing. I couldn’t get enough of the game for the first 3 months after release. Hell i even made theories for the game it is truly and experience worth experiencing
Absolutely 100%. I loved Control and Remedy are ramping things up to the point at which the definition of "game" has been left well behind. This is a deep, cerebral experience with next level visuals, masterfully created story and mechanics that warped my sense of reality and made my skin crawl.
VR developers take note, this is immersion. My disbelief was suspended with little effort and i'm a rational kinda guy. Play this one on console with a good set of headphones, a large display and the lights out. Nothing can even come close to touching what Remedy have achieved with AW2 and i can't wait to see what they have in the pipeline.
Not many game studios make games like them .... its like reading an amazing book
As someone who's played games obsessively my entire life and very rarely ever got bored of them, AW2 left me dissatisfied with everything too after.  Like I subconsciously expected a similar level of plot and presentation even if a game barely has any plot at all lol.
it's okay at best. Madison is much better Imo. 
It’s hard going from 12/10 to just “okay” games. I played BG3 and then went into Starfield, it was hard to see how shitty everything looked, and how much lower quality animations were in general in comparison.
