'''''Alan Wake 2''''' is a 2023 [[Survival horror|survival horror video game]] developed by [[Remedy Entertainment]] and published by [[Epic Games Publishing]]. The sequel to ''[[Alan Wake]]'' (2010), the story follows best-selling novelist Alan Wake, who has been trapped in an alternate dimension for 13 years, as he attempts to escape by writing a horror story involving an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] special agent named Saga Anderson.
''Alan Wake 2'' was released for [[PlayStation 5]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], and [[Xbox Series X and Series S|Xbox Series X/S]] on 27 October 2023. The Xbox Series X version received critical acclaim from critics and the other versions received "generally favorable" reviews. The game was nominated for multiple [[Game of the year award|Game of the Year awards]]. It sold over 1.3 million units by February 2024, making it Remedy's fastest-selling game.
==Gameplay==
[[File:Alan Wake 2 screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A screenshot of ''Alan Wake 2'', showing the player's character, Saga Anderson aiming her flashlight and handgun at an enemy, in an exterior environment.|The player, as Saga, fights an enemy using a pistol and a flashlight. The ammo counter and flashlight meter are visible at the bottom right.]]
Compared to the original ''[[Alan Wake]]'', which is an action-adventure game with horror themes, ''Alan Wake 2'' is a [[survival horror]] game played from a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]]. Players play as Alan Wake or Saga Anderson in two separate [[Single-player video game|single-player]] stories, which can be played in any order the player chooses, although the opening and ending sequences can only be played as Saga and Alan, respectively.
Wake and Anderson traverse environments and fight enemies using various firearms and a flashlight, the latter of which can be "focused" to render enemies vulnerable to firearm attacks. Focusing the flashlight drains its battery, and players need to strategically use a limited amount of batteries and ammunition in order to survive. When enemies are close, Alan or Saga can perform a dodge maneuver.
''Alan Wake 2'' incorporates detective elements: when playing as Saga, players can access an enemy-free space dubbed the "Mind Place". As Alan, players have access to the "Writer's Room", where they can see the [[Outline (list)|outline]] of a novel he is writing. By adding and changing plot details on the outline, they are able to manipulate the space around Alan. Both the Mind Place and the Writer's Room do not pause the outside world.
A returning element from ''Alan Wake'' is of finding manuscript pages that foreshadow upcoming events in the story. ''Alan Wake 2'' features a [[dialogue tree]] system.
==Plot==
{{long plot|date=November 2023}}
The game starts with a monologue by Alan while showing him with a glowing hole in his forehead. A naked man emerges from the dark shores of Cauldron Lake, experiencing visions of a man violently screaming before he is found and has his heart cut out by a group of men wearing deer masks.
FBI Special Agent Saga Anderson and her partner Alex Casey are dispatched to the town of Bright Falls to investigate a series of ritualistic murders. They investigate the latest victim, the naked man, who is revealed as former FBI agent Robert Nightingale. It is believed he was murdered by a group calling themselves "The Cult of the Tree." In addition to Nightingale's corpse, Saga finds a mysterious manuscript page that seems to predict the future. While in the town, they encounter Sheriff Tim Breaker, who promises to assist their investigation, as well as waitress Rose Marigold, who recognizes Saga and acts like Saga was a local of the area, despite this being her first visit to the town. Saga then performs an autopsy on Nightingale's corpse, but it suddenly reanimates and escapes the morgue after Breaker mysteriously vanishes.
As they pursue Nightingale to Cauldron Lake, Casey says he had investigated a murder cult in New York dedicated to bringing back the missing author Alan Wake by reenacting the murders described in his books, and that Nightingale came to Bright Falls to pursue Alan thirteen years prior. Saga encounters Nightingale, now converted into what the manuscript called a "Taken", and is forced to kill him. Saga then finds a very-shaken Alan Wake washed up on the shore of the lake and takes him into custody while also discovering evidence that an organization called the [[Control (video game)|Federal Bureau of Control]] has a presence in Bright Falls. Saga and Casey take Alan back to the inn, where he recounts how he escaped from a dream-like dimension called the Dark Place.
While trapped in the Dark Place, Alan continually tried to find a way to escape. After appearing in a mysterious talk show called "In Between with Mr. Door," Alan found an angel-shaped lamp that, in combination with his writing ability, allowed him to manipulate the Dark Place to better navigate it.
Alan began navigating a dark, twisted version of New York City, following the trail of Alex Casey's investigation of the "Cult of the Word" led by Alan's evil doppelganger, Mr. Scratch, who survived his [[Alan Wake's American Nightmare|erasure from existence]], which brought him through the various scenes of the murders committed by the cult. Along the way, Alan also encountered Breaker, who was searching for the talk show host, Mr. Door, believing him to be responsible for trapping him in the Dark Place. Alan also occasionally made brief contact with Saga, the two of them trading vital information when they could. After believing he had killed Tom Zane, who had gone insane from his captivity inside the Dark Place, Alan was contacted by an alternative version of himself, explaining that his repeated attempts to escape the Dark Place are causing him to experience time loops.
Back in the present, Alan explains that he wrote a new novel, ''Return'', that helped him escape the Dark Place. However, Scratch re-edited the manuscript into a horror story now taking effect in reality. Alan warns that Scratch is searching for the Clicker, which is the key he needs to free the malevolent Dark Presence completely, but also the key to permanently defeating it. With one of the manuscript pages mentioning the Cult of the Tree possesses the Clicker, Saga decides to follow its trail and realizes that ''Return'' has rewritten her past so that her daughter Logan drowned in an accident. Angered that Alan wrote her and Logan into his story, Saga recovers the Clicker from Taken deputies Mulligan and Thornton, but before she can get it to Alan, agents from the FBC led by Agent Kiran Estevez arrive and apprehend him as well as the Cult leaders, revealed to be town entrepreneurs Ilmo and Jaakko Koskela.
With no other options, Saga tracks down Odin and Tor Anderson, who know more about the Clicker. As she communicates with them and rescues Tor from a Taken Cynthia Weaver, she learns that Odin and Tor are actually her grand-uncle and grandfather, respectively, and she inherited their seer abilities, allowing her to discern the changes to reality ''Return'' is causing. Odin and Tor also explain that the Clicker does not do anything by itself but instead dramatically enhances the creative power of the person using it, which is why it is important to Alan and Scratch. Saga then heads back to Bright Falls to get the Clicker to Alan but finds out that the Alan who escaped Cauldron Lake wasn't Alan, but Scratch. With his identity now exposed, Scratch kills Jaakko and escapes from captivity, attempting to take the Clicker from Saga. He is temporarily thwarted and banished, thanks to the FBC's light technology, leaving Saga wondering what to do next.
Ilmo reveals that he and Jaakko formed the cult in order to scare townsfolk away from the dangers of the lake, while they perform their 'ritual killings' on whatever Taken emerges from it, such as Nightingale. Realizing that Alan is still trapped in the Dark Place, Saga enlists the help of Casey, Odin, Tor, and Estevez to carry out a ritual to summon him to the real world. Meanwhile, Alan continues to try and find a way out of the Dark Place, eventually making his way to his old apartment. There, he discovers his wife Alice had been tormented with visions of Scratch, which she photographed and turned into an art exhibition called "the Dark Place", hoping to find Alan through them. However, her obsession drove her to despair until eventually she photographed her own suicide. In anger, Alan kills who he believes is Scratch but is actually a version of himself attempting to fix Scratch's ending of ''Return'', perpetuating the loop. Realizing that he was the one terrorizing Alice instead of Scratch, Alan lets the Dark Presence possess him.
Back in the real world, the summoning ritual fails to summon Alan in the current time and instead was responsible for his initial appearance earlier in the story. Both Saga and Alan come to the realization that Alan and Scratch were always the same person, with Scratch being Alan, who is possessed by the Dark Presence at the end of every loop, which Alan later realizes became weakened from crossing into the real world, forcing it into dormancy while regaining its strength. Scratch arrives at the summoning site and Saga is able to banish him from Alan's body, only for Scratch to possess Casey instead, steal the Clicker, and throw Saga into the Dark Place.
With Scratch in possession of the Clicker, Alan concludes that the only way to stop him now is to find the manuscript and write a completely new ending for ''Return''. He returns to his Writing Room and tries to work out how to write a perfect ending that saves everybody while staying consistent with the horror genre, realizing that Saga is his co-author to help write the ending together. Meanwhile, trapped in her mind palace, Saga fights off the Dark Presence's attempt to overwhelm her with her own negative emotions and self-doubt. Now in the Dark Place proper, she reunites with Breaker, who remains there in his search for Door, heavily implied to be Saga's missing father. She then receives aid from an anonymous woman, implied to be Alice, who directs her to the Clicker and a Bullet of Light. Saga takes the two items and escapes back to the real world by mimicking Door's actions on a manuscript page. Connecting to Alan through her mind palace, they realize they are the heroes of the story, but for the ending to save everyone, one of the heroes needs to pay a heavy price. With the Clicker and Alan's revised ending for ''Return'', Saga is able to banish Scratch from Casey's body. Alan goads Scratch into possessing him again, and Saga shoots him with the Bullet of Light, seemingly killing him and Scratch but looping his monologue back to the beginning of the game, creating a time-loop for each playthrough. As Casey recovers from his possession, Saga tries to call Logan to confirm her safety, but the scene cuts short before any answer can be heard.
In a post-credits scene, a recording left behind by Alice reveals that after speaking to the FBC at their offices(as mentioned in ''Control''), she had managed to fully regain her memories of what happened to Alan and her time in the Dark Place. She used her exhibition to trick Alan into thinking she committed suicide but instead chose to return to the Dark Place as part of a plan to help him eventually escape, explaining that the only way he can escape the loops is through either "destruction" or "ascension". Alan must continue the loop and keep going through destruction until he's ready for ascension, with Alice's words and love as his light preparing him bit by bit. Alan then revives from his gunshot wound and says, "It's not a loop, it's a spiral."
The [[New Game Plus]] mode, ''The Final Draft'', has a different ending: as he hands Saga his revised ending for ''Return'', Alan remembers that the Dark Presence has caught them in a time loop that makes them forget right until the end, and that choices in the Dark Place can affect both the future and the past. He realizes that the Dark Presence was born from the remains of darkness from Alan after he was shot by the Bullet of Light. The Dark Presence eventually found Alan in the past and influenced him, kick-starting the plot of the first game. The link between it and Alan was severed after finishing ''Return'', but the Dark Presence remained as Alan was missing the part of himself it was born from: Alice. Realizing that he and Alice are still connected through his writing and her photos, the Bullet of Light finally succeeds and kills Scratch for good, breaking the loop. Saga's call connects, confirming Logan's survival, and Alan revives soon after to the surprise of her and Casey. Confirming the ending worked, he thanks Alice, then declares himself the bearer of the light and the master of not just two worlds, but many. A video Alan can find in the Final Draft shows an earlier version of himself that theorizes that the notes, clues and writings that guide him on his journey, which he thought were from himself in previous loops, may also partly be from a future version of himself from beyond the loops{{snd}}"some elevated, enlightened version"{{snd}}using the current Alan as a pawn to create his own apotheosis.
==Development==
===Pre-production===
Remedy Entertainment released ''[[Alan Wake]]'' in 2010. Learning from ''[[Max Payne]]'', they wrote ''Alan Wake'' in a way that allows additional story to be told through sequels and further installments. The team began discussing sequel ideas after ''Alan Wake'' was shipped, which would continue to star Alan Wake as the protagonist, but also explore the stories of the supporting characters including Wake's friend Barry Wheeler and Sheriff Sarah Breaker. A prototype was created to show off the gameplay of ''Alan Wake 2'' when the studio was showing the game to potential publishers. The game would have been a direct sequel to ''Alan Wake'', featuring new enemies and new gameplay mechanics, such as being able to rewrite reality, which were showcased in the prototype. Ultimately, Remedy pitched the project to ''Alan Wake'' publisher [[Microsoft Studios]]. Microsoft, however, at the time was not interested in a sequel and instead, tasked Remedy to create a new game. This ultimately became ''[[Quantum Break]]'', released in 2016. It included, alongside other [[Easter egg (media)|easter eggs]] to ''Alan Wake'', a short live-action film, titled ''Alan Wake: Return''. It features two FBI agents, one named Alex Casey, investigating the reappearance of Wake, which had been created by Remedy as to help promote a sequel to publishers. The other FBI agent was Saga Anderson, who was portrayed by [[Malla Malmivaara]]. She was later recast with [[Melanie Liburd]]. Most of the ideas for ''Alan Wake 2'' were implemented in ''[[Alan Wake's American Nightmare|American Nightmare]]'', a downloadable follow-up to ''Alan Wake''. Remedy CEO Tero Virtala stated that any further sequels to ''Alan Wake'' would require Microsoft Studios' approval as the publishing rights holder, though Remedy otherwise owns all other [[intellectual property]] rights to the series.
When ''Quantum Break'' was announced, [[Sam Lake]] explained that a sequel to ''Alan Wake'' had been postponed, and that ''Alan Wake'' was not financially successful enough to receive the funding they needed to continue developing the sequel at the time. Director of communications Thomas Puha stated in April 2019 that Remedy had briefly returned to work on an ''Alan Wake'' property about two years prior, but the effort did not work out, and the company was booked for the next few years, between their own new game ''[[Control (video game)|Control]]'', supporting [[Smilegate]] on its game ''[[CrossfireX]]'', and another new project. Puha said that the only limited factor for them to work on an ''Alan Wake'' sequel was "time, money, and resources". Despite that, Lake continued to be part of a team in Remedy to brainstorm ideas and work on different incarnations for ''Alan Wake 2''. Internally, the project was code-named "Project Big Fish", which represented its importance and significance to Remedy. In the second [[downloadable content]] pack for ''Control'', Remedy's next game following ''Quantum Break'', Alan Wake was featured as a character. According to Remedy, ''Control'' established the "Remedy Connected Universe" which is shared by both ''Control'' and ''Alan Wake'', and that the next game released by the studio will also be set on this universe.
Remedy fully acquired the rights to ''Alan Wake'' from Microsoft in July 2019, including a one-time royalty payment of about {{euro|2.5 million|link=yes}} for the game series' past sales, which helped pave the way for a sequel. Remedy had signed with [[Epic Games Publishing]] in 2021 for the release of two games. Remedy released ''[[Alan Wake Remastered]]'' in October 2021 as the first game of this partnership, while the second, larger game, ''Alan Wake 2'', was announced at [[The Game Awards 2021]]. Remedy's communications director Thomas Puha said that Epic allowed Remedy to create the game they wanted to make with minimal publisher interference, while providing extensive feedback to help improve the game.
===Production===
With Epic as their publisher, Remedy began production on ''Alan Wake 2'' in August 2019. According to Sam Lake, the game would be powered by Remedy's own [[Northlight Engine]], which they used for ''Quantum Break'' and ''Control''. Lake also stated that ''Alan Wake 2'' would be a [[survival horror]] game, as opposed to ''Alan Wake'', which Lake said was "an [[action game]] with horror elements", though he did not explain the difference between the two. Lake further added that players will not need to play the previous games in order to understand ''Alan Wake 2''. Lake said that his approach to ''Alan Wake 2'' was bolstered by the success of the film ''[[Everything Everywhere All At Once]]''.
Remedy confirmed the game would remain in the [[third-person perspective]] despite the switch to survival horror, and that both [[Ilkka Villi]] and [[Matthew Porretta]] would return to provide the appearance and the voice of Alan, respectively. Other cast include [[Melanie Liburd]] as the live-action and voice of Saga Anderson, [[David Harewood]] as both the live-action and voice of Mr. Door, [[James McCaffrey (actor)|James McCaffrey]] and Lake as the voice and live-action appearance of Alex Casey, respectively. Further, ''Alan Wake 2'' includes cameos from characters in ''Control'', including Jesse Faden (voiced by [[Courtney Hope]]), Dr. Darling (Porretta) and the mysterious janitor Ahti ([[Martti Suosalo]]).
Alan's story includes a mission known as "Initiation 4" or "We Sing", which has the player guide Alan through a surreal set while Alan's psyche, Mr. Door, and others sing "Herald of Darkness", a musical (via live-action video) summarizing Alan's story to that point, with music provided by [[Poets of the Fall]] (playing as the fictional band "The Old Gods of Asgard"). Lake said the idea for the musical sequence was inspired by ''Alan Wake''{{'s}} concert standoff as well as the Ashtray Maze level in ''[[Control (video game)|Control]]'', both set to Poets of the Fall's music. Lake also knew that Porretta (Wake) and Harewood (Mr. Door) could sing, and Poets of the Fall were able to help with choreography. Frequently through development, some of the developers questioned the need for the musical sequence due to both the strangeness of the sequence in the horror game and the difficulties in pulling it off. However, Lake insisted that the sequence be kept. The song was played live at [[The Game Awards 2023]] by Poets of the Fall, along with Villi, Porretta, Harewood, and Lake reprising their roles.
Overall, the game took 13 years to develop. In an interview, Sam Lake said this was because "The sequel contains many characters and locations, as well as a continuation of the supernatural lore established and introduced in the original Alan Wake."
The Budget for the game reportedly stands at €70 million, with €50 million in development and an additional €20 million spent on marketing. This is considered to make the game one of the most expensive cultural products in the history of Finland.
==== Graphics technology ====
Prior to the release of ''Alan Wake 2'', Remedy Entertainment had earned a reputation for pushing visual boundaries and graphics technology with releases such as ''[[Control (video game)|Control]]'' and ''[[Max Payne 2]]''. ''Alan Wake 2'' was developed with [[Ninth generation of video game consoles|ninth generation consoles]] in mind. For its traditional graphics rasterization, ''Alan Wake 2'' harnesses [[Shader#Primitive and Mesh shaders|mesh shaders]] that are only supported by the [[PlayStation 5]], [[Xbox Series X and Series S|Xbox Series X/S]], and [[Nvidia]] [[GeForce 20 series|GeForce RTX 20 series]] or [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] [[Radeon RX 6000 series|Radeon RX 6000 series]] GPUs and later on PC. The game was the first to be released with native support for mesh shaders. As opposed to older vertex and geometry shading techniques, mesh shaders try to reduce the bottleneck from rendering a large number of fixed vertex triangles by instead flexibly rendering large groups of triangles. Developers are given greater control over rendering complex geometry as mesh shaders can be segmented into smaller meshlets that can be re-used and rendered in-parrallel while making less calls for data from memory. The graphics pipeline is also shorter with mesh shaders as opposed to a traditional vertex and tessellation pipeline.
[[Ray tracing (graphics)|Ray tracing]] is extensively used in ''Alan Wake 2'' to better simulate how light reacts realistically behaves in the real world. Scenes are lit using [[global illumination]] and the light provided by the global light source bounces off surfaces and diffuses depending on the materials present. The use of ray tracing is particularly important for adding ambience to dark scenes in the game that feature flashlights as a sole light source. ''Alan Wake 2'' even goes beyond ray tracing to incorporate path tracing where diffused light will also bounce across duller surfaces in addition to reflective ones. Path tracing's computational demands means that it is not not available on the limited console hardware. ''Alan Wake 2''{{'}}s extensive use of ray tracing made it a promotional vessel for Nvidia's graphics technologies such as supporting DLSS 3.5 Ray Reconstruction. DLSS 3.5 Ray Reconstruction on Nvidia GeForce RTX graphics cards seeks to improve ray tracing visual quality and performance by not performing calculations on multiple rays per pixxel and instead using machine learning to fill in the gaps.
==Release==
Remedy announced in May 2023 that ''Alan Wake 2'' would be a digital-only release, rationalizing that many players had already shifted to only buying games digitally, so they wanted to ensure the game maintains a low price, and they didn't want it to require a separate download even if a physical version was released. Originally planned to release for [[PlayStation 5]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], and [[Xbox Series X and Series S|Xbox Series X/S]] on 17 October 2023, Remedy delayed the game by ten days to 27 October to avoid competition from other major triple-A releases. The PC version is exclusive to the [[Epic Games Store]] for "a long time". Free [[downloadable content]] packs and two paid expansions, titled ''Night Springs'' and ''Lake House'', will be released after the game's initial launch.
=== Marketing ===
An Alan Wake cosmetic outfit was added to ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'' as part of the "Fortnitemares 2023" event and a retelling of the first ''Alan Wake'' was available within ''[[Fortnite Creative]]'' in the weeks prior to the sequel's release to help new players come up to speed on events from the first game.
From 10 October to 13 November 2023, a free copy of ''Alan Wake 2'' was included in a promotional bundle with the purchase of certain [[Nvidia]] [[GeForce 40 series|GeForce RTX 40 series]] GPUs. The eligible GPUs for the bundle were the RTX 4070, RTX 4070 Ti, RTX 4080 and RTX 4090.
Alan Wake was added to the video game ''[[Dead by Daylight]]'' in January 2024. Additional cosmetics were included with his release, including skins that turn the character into either Saga Anderson, Rose Marigold, and Mr. Scratch. {{bcn|date=March 2024}}
