[[Alan Wake Dancing to Herald of Darkness except I animated it]]





Remedy's AW Instagram account shared this, BE PROUD!
    The dance choreographer liked it too :‚Äô-)

I‚Äôm sure someone out there will animate the whole thing I was just having a bit of a giggle

Edit: Sam Lake shared it, time to lie-down
        You are the champion of light
I finally finished the game the other day and this whole sequence has been resolutely stuck in my brain. I had some fun rotoscoping Alan dancing in between work.
    Genuinely a good ‚Äúvisualizer‚Äù for the moves too!!!!
    This is a bit late on the bandwagon, but yeah I absolutely adored this bit, too. As a theatre kid and midlevel-musical enthusiast, I sat there, grinning ear to ear the entire level.

The lyrics are so doubly and triply packed with meaning, too.

‚ÄûIf he had seen her drowning he could‚Äôve saved her from the darkness of the lake‚Äú‚Ä¶

Chills.

This entire song is a summary of Alan Wake I, a bio of his life, a ballad about depression and repressed anger, a foreshadowing, a reframing and just plain campy fun. Been listening to it in the background while working from home for the past 2 hours now.
Is this rotoscoped? Looks great! 10/10
    Yep! 180-ish frames of fun.
        I love rotoscoping, you did a great job!
[animation bros ! I did the same when I beat the game too ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AlanWake/s/bglWzAYoxy)
    No way! The movement is so well observed. Great work!
    Fuck yeah! This is the second or third deepest level of his loop, reimagined with a southpark filter on top.
Great work! I love this!
I watched Sam Lake dancing this the day after the game awards totally out of context and I thought "Oh, shit, don't do stupid things to promote your game, Sam".
Then I played the game. And I played We sing and then I watched again Old gods of Asgard performance and I was like "FUCK YEAAAAAAAAH!!!"
this males me happy, is awesome
    This is a hilarious typo
        lmao I haven't seen it hahahahaha

now I won't correct it, it is what it is
Really nice work on the movement in the jacket & tie.
I love this so much - nicely done!
Love it.
AWESOME!!!!
You nailed it!
This is so cool.  I‚Äôm 100% drawn to his shadow (which is so fitting), really excellent work
Somehow you created Jarvis Cocker
    While I was making it I kept thinking that haha
Love the TGA show ffs Made me get the game. I¬¥m always watching it :D
Sang along a little bit, can‚Äôt believe how well I have the dance and song memorized haha. Perfect loop too and I love the way you animated the shadow!! Good job OP üòç
A. This is perfect B. I'm so happy it was recognised C. Does anyone else do this dance now just because?
The secondary animations for hair and clothes are sooooo satisfying, looks like you're really good at picking keyframes and what other stuff needs to be animated!
Alan would love and be very perplexed by this. Good job!
Playing this game was so different and refreshing!
You did a really good job, it‚Äôs so cute
This is amazing! So well done.  Love it
Awesome work dude.
Flawless. Love your style!
He dances for his freedom! (Impeccable work!)
I can hear the music!
I love this, you did an awesome job!
Exquisite
How is this not a fortnite emote already
Looks Fantastic
I love it! Wasn‚Äôt he holding a flashlight and gun? lol¬†
