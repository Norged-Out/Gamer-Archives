[[Is Alan Wake 2 better than Alan Wake ]]


I’m playing Alan Wake Remastered right now because I’ve heard Alan Wake 2 is amazing. It hasn’t really clicked for me though. The story feels a bit too messy with not enough lore to make it make sense. I wish it explained stuff a bit better so the story engaged me more. Gameplay is actually cool concept  and can be fun but also feels janky many times (I’m guessing that’s mostly from the original game being old).

Just wondering if 2 is different enough that I’d enjoy it ? Did anyone here think the original Alan wake was okay but loved the 2nd?

Edit: everyone seems to say 2 is much better, good to know! I’ll def try it once I’m done with 1 


I thought IGN's review was spot on: "Alan Wake II is a superb survival horror sequel that makes the cult-classic original seem like little more than a rough first draft by comparison."
    The creators have even said what they achieved with Alan Wake 2 was what they were aiming for with the original, but budget and time constraints and other factors basically caused the first game to just become a generic action game with a cool narrative concept.

It's interesting because this is one of those times where a failure was probably the best outcome; the ideas conceived and lessons learned from developing Control along with graphical technology  being so much further along are all integral to what made this game so good.
        I'd go as far as to call Alan Wake 1 a bad action game with a cool narrative concept. Compared to Max Payne and Control, it's just so darn frustrating.
        >Budget and Time Constraints

*but because Microsoft were assholes and wanted an Xbox 360 Exclusive instead of a multiplatform game optimized for PC

Just call Microsoft out on their shit, they’re the reason things went south with Alan Wake and why we had Energizer battery and Lincoln vehicles with Microsoft Snyc as product placement. 

I still remember the Untergang film meme with Hitler that was going around about the PC release getting canned. 


The original release of Death Stranding had similar features with the Monster Energy product placement because of the Studio being small as well.
I thought AW1 was okay. But AW2 was a mind-blowing experience.
    I agree. I missed one thing about Alan Wake 1 in the sequel, being able to drive to go from one location to another, with the current look it would be incredible, especially if an event occurred while driving, like a shadow in the middle of the road for example.
        That and the flashlight working (but less powerful) without concentrating were the only two things I missed.

There was some times where I wished the game was less scary (dem jump scares), but with the power of hindsight, I think it was better this way. The first game wasn't very scary at all IMO. The second game was really scary to me.

I'm glad I played through the games in release order (back to back, first time playing them all). It would have been really hard to go to either of the first two games after AW2. They feel like completely different genres, even.
    Pretty much. I tried playing through the remaster and i just couldnt. AW2 is too good.
        Yeah lol, same as me. After a mind-blowing experience I‘ve bought AW1 and played like 2-3h to stop then. It wasn‘t bad, but just no comparison for me. But then I got Control and after getting used to it, I had a lot if fun either. But AW2 is on the very top of the edge.
I really liked the first one, but AW2 is juat an all around much better game. That said, I do miss the flashlight from the first game - I felt it was more fun to use and made combat more fun overall.
    Agreed about the flashlight. But, there is one aspect of it that is really clever. I think the scarcity of battery charges makes the game scarier. The fear of running too low on battery had me extra stressed in some parts.

Though I'm undecided on how much that improved the game. It is a horror game, so some stress is a good thing. But too much stress of the wrong kind can just be... distracting?
        I actually found myself running out of battery more in the first game than this one.
I personally prefer Alan wake 2 a lot over the original, tbh it feels much more resident evil than the first one
    Yeah I’m a RE fan and was expecting that from the original, good to know the 2nd is more like RE
        Oh you’ll probably like it then!
        RE is better
            RE has better gameplay by far, and especially in terms of replayability.

But Alan wakes presentation and story is by far the better aspect between the two franchises.

If you want a good story, you play Alan wake, if you want good gameplay you play RE.
        RE has better combat, but on normal or hard the AW combat and inventory management can test at times.

I personally like the mood and the vibes in AW2 100% more.
    Actually, Alan's part feels more like Silent Hill
        Hilariously I found it to be reminiscent of SH4 specifically
            Agreed. It is a lot like SH4.
            I agree. I thought more Silent Hill then Resident Evil. 
        I really think this is intentional. So much of AW2 builds on the players' expectations going in, and the super clear parallels to RE and SH (specifically RE4 and SH2 and 4) can't be an accident.

Think about it: Saga is a government agent sent to a small, reclusive town to investigate cult murders. When sue gets there, she discovers that the actions of the "cult" were actually the influence of an ancient dormant mind-controlling entity that's lain dormant for millennia under the nearby lake. Alan is a flawed husband who is navigating a city/hall of mirrors, populated by grotesque representations of his personal trauma, on a quest to find his wife, who is leaving clues to help him to conquer his ugly past and their damaged relationship to escape >!despite her apparently being dead.!< Those are the plots of RE4 and SH2.
I respect the original for setting up the world, themes and characters... But in all honesty, playing the remaster in anticipation for AW2 made me realize how campy the original really is. Gameplay has aged like milk in my opinion, and the dialogue tends to be corny as hell.

AW2 is what I'd regard as a modern masterpiece though, and definitely one of my favorie games of all time. So yeah. Just a warning though: the sequel is in many ways even more out-there storywise than the first game, so if that didn't click for you you might have a hard time getting into this one – even if the contrast of Saga's sections serves as a way to introduce narratives in a less psychadelic way than Alan's parts.
2 is almost completely different, honestly. More horror focused, more actual plot, more detailed environments and less running through dull and repetitive forests, etc.

It's night and day
    And the Taken don't say funny things while they're chasing you :(
        WAKE

        I'M DROWNING
    Exactly. They’re so very different. I love both for different reasons. The first one feels more twin peaks style and silly. The second game is like well there’s no silent hill anytime soon, so here ya go champ.
        the second one feels more like twin peaks fire walk with me or season 3 i think. the first is definitely riffing on the original 2 seasons without any of the really horrifying elements.
        It’s definitely a send up to Silent Hill 2, which is perfect.
            The godda@@ shadows whispering in the second game were awful lol. They made my stomach knot up.
It’s a more focused game from a team with 13 years experience under its belt.
 Alan Wake 1 went through so much iteration before finally being greatly scaled back from its original vision.

 The bones are still there and there are moments of greatness, but AW2 was as close to a perfect experience for as I could hope for.
I'm going to bang the drum for Alan Wake 1 here.

Alan Wake 1 is a unique game with its own identity. As much as I enjoyed Alan Wake 2 and was impressed with its production quality, there is an aesthetic to Alan Wake 1 that no other games can match.
Apples and oranges.
It’s a much better game with more engaging gameplay but the story is not any less crazy mind you.
    I’d say it gets crazier. First game was a lot more tame imo, especially when comparing to Alan’s side lol Saga’s is pretty decent to grasp after looking into things tho
Alan wake 1 had a good concept with combat and had a good story but the combat got way too repetitive and was way too much action when it should have been horror. They fixed all those issues with Alan wake 2 to create a mind blowing and unforgettable experience
Some things I really was surprised weren’t included and added into were the ravens chasing you. I felt there was a real chance to have that in a few parts. Like why add wolves but not iterate on the other animals that can be taken over. Give me rattlers hanging from trees, or bears! Also, the poltergeist objects that shoot at you is almost entirely gone from the sequel. It’s purely as a walk to keep you from the next area and not an enemy type. Also, where is driving? I really liked the dr icing sequence n the first game, and along with mean it felt awesome. I wanted way more car gameplay. That could have been added into a lot more. I love the sequel. It just felt like there were some things they clearly dropped.
Alan Wake is still very good but Alan Wake 2 is a big step-up. That's a good thing.
If you go in with any knowledge of either:

-David Lynch (and in particular, Twin Peaks)

-Stephen King (especially his early work)

It will be an easy task, especially during Alan Wake 2

But in essence, it’s the story of a writer who went missing for a week, who’s trying to save his wife. The game is amazing for 2010, but is obviously dated as of 2023/2024, but still holds up fairly well.
2 is significantly better.

1 is a mediocre tps with a flashlight.

2 is one of the best survival horror games ever made
    From a story perspective, maybe.

&#x200B;

Gameplay wise? Not at all.
Yes, it is substantially better.  There’s a much better fit between gameplay and story.
>The story feels a bit too crazy with not enough lore to make it feel grounded. 

That's how I felt about one as well initially. Playing Control actually helped me understand and appreciate the first AW a lot more, cause it does explain a few things. But AW2 definitely is a lot more lore intensive so don't worry, I think you'll like it more.  AW1 was a action/shooter with a horror/thriller coat of paint. 

But AW2 is actually a survival horror.  All the encounters have been dialed up more, so now it's not "run from A to B and run to some light switches along the way". There is a bit of that, but it's much more methodical. It's more interested in the story this time around.
    I love crazy stories but it needs enough lore so it actually makes sense and feel plausible in a way. Glad AW2 does that! 

I love RE games so huge plus that it’s more of a survival horror
        It's not going to be a straightforward coheritive storyline if that's what you're expecting. And that's the beauty and magic of both games. I actually prefer the storytelling of one because I'm a huge Twin peaks fan and that was the whole pull of it for me.

Two at times is even more ambiguous and not straightforward. There's a million comparative parallels to Twin peaks in the first game as are in two but I would say two is far more like an a24 horror movie. Really wacky goofy crazy shit going on if you're not into it I don't think it's going to be for you either. 

If you like movies like hereditary the lighthouse the witch etc if that's not your kind of horror this will not be your kind of horror.
        I would say AW2 is less RE and more Silent Hill.  Having said that, a lot of it's gameplay mechanics like the crime wall, where you can literally go into the protagonists mind palace and and break down the plot/crime, piece by piece. I haven't really seen that in a game before.
        I will note that the Remedyverse is vast, so, for the best experience, playing or at least watching all games is a must. Even Alan Wake American Nightmare and Quantum Break, which are foundational for AW2. Each game gives more and more lore crumbs, and it adds up, though Remedy made a good job in having AW2 stand on its own, so you don't NEED to see it all for a good experience.

Also, there is more lore out in special places. Check out This House of Dreams. It's a blog that connects AW and Control.
I still prefer AW1 combat, but I prefer AW2 in every other category
AW2 is alot better than the first. But still the new one still has janky outdated combat. It feels like re remake combat but quite a bit worse.. great story and visual though if you’re into that vibe.
Yes and no.
I preferred the way the story was presented in 2, obviously higher production values, looked amazing etc. But the combat and gameplay loop of 1 felt better.
In every way.
Yes and it's not even close
Yes it is in almost every way, but if you didn’t like it because the story is too out there then I don’t think you’ll find AW2 better because it’s REALLY out there.
    It wasn’t necessary how out there it was but that it felt messy. Too little explanation and lore building that would make the crazy stuff feel somewhat real. 

Ive played control a little and its world is also crazy but it  builds on it with lore. It gives some explaining for some of the crazy things.
I really enjoyed AW1 Remastered. I actually prefer the combat in the original game even if it is a little janky. 

AW2 is technically much more impressive, it has some mindblowing sections. But there is a lot more 'slow burn' like fiddling with the evidence board, dialogue.

The combat and gameplay in AW2 is actually really fun sometimes there's just long stretches where you aren't really fighting anything or it'll just be like 2 dudes you take out. I played on hard and finished the game with like 10 med packs, pills, bandages, shotgun ammo, batteries. I've never played a 'survival horror' game like this where the combat felt so non threatening at all times. 

That said I'd still highly recommend AW2 but I think many games do this action survival horror combat thing MUCH better like Dead Space Remake, Resident Evil 4 Remake, Evil Within 2, TLoU Part 2, RE 7/8, RE2 Remake, etc, etc .
I played the first game last month. It didn't really click until about chapter 3. I'm 10 hours into 2 right now and loving it
I think alan wake 1 has a lot of stuff that I really missed in the sequel. Being able to drive was a major one. Also the physics in the first game are honestly kind of better compared to the sequel. Moving stuff like chairs and boxes feels so static in 2 compared to 1. Besides all of that, everything else was a major improvement
    The pace was also faster
Yeah. It's totally different though... Like, seriously don't expect a similar experience
For me Alan Wake 2 was amazing because of the greatness of the first game and I would say the original takes it
Nope. Not even remotely.
2 is more like recent survival horror games in terms of look and gameplay, so if you like that, then yes it will be "better" than the 13-year old xbox 360 action-adventure game you're playing right now. 

But, uh, if you don't like it when the story & lore isn't explained, I've got bad news for you...
Yeah
Wtf?! I didn't know so many people here hated AW1!
yes
I like both equally tbh.
...hard to say.
- visualy and technologicaly it looks better...
- but playing AW1 for the first time and experiencing the shadows and "story" and it's gimmicks was awesome experience... ( when I sat down to play AW2 I alredy was familiar with the core mechanics and I knew what to expect, I sometimes wish that I could play some games for the first time again...)
- I personaly like both of them, ( AW1 is more of a horror thriller where you are trying to grasp what is happening, while AW2 is like watching Twin Peaks...it's kinda more "cassual"?)
 - I personaly would give them 1 or 2 more years to iron out some bits and knacks ( for example combat and certain locations/events)
- but I am big fan of all Remedy games and I can't wait for their next projects...
I preferred Alan Wake 1 to 2, to be honest. 2 was just far too buggy and long. I did like the level design change gimmick in the Wake sections for a while, but I think the simple gameplay and intriguing, simpler teasing narrative of the first one just felt better.
If the lore of the game doesn’t interest you, then it’s better not to start the sequel at all. In addition, for the full picture you need to complete Control from Remedy.  


From a gameplay point of view, I think the game is not fundamentally different. You still need to shine your flashlight at the dark figures and then shoot them. At the same time, the sequel is more focused on investigation than on shootouts, this should be kept in mind.
Hell no
I like the first more, but I'm in the minority.
Yes, BUT I like the openness and vast forest areas in 1 that is lacking in 2. I also have never experienced an aiming system like 1, it’s the only system where I don’t have to spend ages adjusting sensitivity, it points exactly where I want it when I want it.
I was disappointed with Alan Wake 2's gameplay design in terms of going back and forth all game long between the mind place and the actual environment. AW1 was pure action horror with a great story. I wanted more of that but felt that they did a total 180 for AW2. There's a whole lot of story and good horror in AW2, but it just didn't feel as unique and felt like a chore to complete. It felt like there was a gameplay/design structure from the start and they forced the game into that structure, when IMO the structure creates a frustrating experience for the player.
    Agreed
Probably, but Alan Wake 1 came out when I was 20 and playing it got me through lots of bad times, so nostalgia factor wins
I'll give you a different perspective from someone who didn't like either games. I had same issues with the first game as you did, so much so that I didn't even finish it but AW2 seemed like everything I ever wanted in a survival horror game and it was my most hyped game last year. Unfortunately I was quite dissapointed by it. You said that you are a RE fan and this game doesn't even come close to games such as RE2R and RE4R. Especially in regards to combat and enemy encounters. REs stories are usually a mess but AW2 to me had a much worse story than those games because it tries so hard to be serious that it ends up disconnected, predictable and overall boring. Atleast RE is aware of itself being a mess and doesn't take itself so serious. Don't get me wrong the game is well made and Remedy does deserve praise for it but it didn't click with me at all. I just wanted to give you some different perspective even though I'm in minority.
This is gonna be my old man comment, but I see so many comments about these 2 games and how different they are, and I realize that most of these comments are most likely made by gamers much younger than I am. I picked up Alan Wake on the xbox 360 at release night, and I play it all night, then replayed numerous times after that. Never play american nightmare, or the other dlcs. Just picked this up on my switch for remastered. And just finished my first playthrough of that and I feel as nostalgic as the first time I played this back on my 360. I see so many gamers now adays only care about the coolness factor with these games. And I just remember playing my game boy color before there were any backlit screens. 

But in all seriousness, the original alan wake will always have a special spot in my heart as a gamer, I remember being hooked as soon as you are on the ferry and pass under the bridge to look up and see "WELCOME TO BRIGHT FALLS" on the bridge. Then meeting the anderson brothers in the diner the first time you go in, seeing the presence in the back of the diner. Then going with your wife to the lake house on cauldron lake, then it all hits the fan and you awake near the car after the accident, trying to figure out what happened to alice. Just this game hits many bases for me and I love it every time I play through it! 

I have no doubt Alan Wake 2 is overall a much better game in terms of how they can build atmosphere with the great increase in graphics, ray tracing etc. But nothing will compare to me playing this game on release night.
    I can see that, nostalgia def plays a huge role in how we think of games!
        I think it is funny that I can barely remember what I ate for lunch yesterday, but I remember my all nighter playing alan wake on release night, and the same with skyrim on release night.
Personally I like AW1 slightly better than AW2. There are definitely some improvement for AW2 though. 

If you want pure horror though AW2 is better than 1 though.
    Totally agree. The story, atmosphere, characters, etc in AW1 were significantly better. I especially missed Barry and the Night Springs TV show.
    You'd need to elaborate on that one as it's quite the hot take :D
        Let me preface this by saying Alan Wake 1&2 are my #1&2 favorite games of all time, so I'm not saying 2 is bad.

Both are completely different games with different atmospheres. While not as detailed I liked the openness of 1, it felt like a vast open real world even if you couldn't explore it all, but being able to look out into the canyons and mountains always gave me a sense of awe. 2 is a more cramped and claustrophobic atmosphere, which isn't bad and works better for the more horror aspects of the game. 


Personally while 1's gameplay was a little samey and repetitive, it was consistent and pretty fun. While 2 is improved in some ways, I also found it less consistent and more frustrating at times, especially the flashlight regard. Though infinite running is way more fun than 1. 
I also wish we got to see more of Bright falls in 2, like in 1. 


1's vibe was also weird, charming, and sinister all wrapped in one, while 2 is more weird and straight up horror, I just prefer 1 a little more. 


Saga and the Koskella Brothers were great additions, but no Barry. 
And I absolutely loved finding and watching the Night Springs episodes in 1.

There are a lot of things I like about 2 better as well, but this is just about 1.
            Thanks for taking the time to give a detailed breakdown. While I don't agree with all of it there's lots of understandable takes.

I never knew Barry was such a fan favorite. I found him pretty annoying back when I played it at release time. 😐 Seems like I'm the odd one out and cool to see how many people liked him.

"...always gave me a sense of AWE" - don't think you did that on purpose but it's brilliant none the less 😅

The only point where I fully agree is that it's sad that they removed a lot of the charming "twin peaks" weirdness from part 1. 
That's maybe the only point where I really think 1 was superior.
AW 1, for me, was a more enjoyable experience. It's actually one of my favourite games and I was hoping 2 would expand on it differently.

I liked 2, and I was excited when it was released to outstanding reviews in late 2023, but these games are vastly different. AW 1 is a horror shooter, AW 2 is pure survival horror, and to be honest, it's really not that scary.

It felt like a giant escape maze with awesome graphics and a cool story. Not necessarily a bad thing, but for me, AW 1 was just a better time in front of the TV.
No. The gameplay in Alan Wake was full of action and has great battles. 2 is not. 2 is slow, too long, and doesn't make sense plot wise. Although 2 is excellent as far as graphics, most of it is just live human acting with no artistic enhancements,the story is too long, there is very little action, and when there is some it doesn't flow well.
A bit late, but if you miss lore, play Control. It gives tons of lore in how the world(s) work, explains the supernatural part and builds the world pretty much up.

You can see it like that, AW (introduction/prologue) Control (world building and setup) AW2 (beginning)
Just posted something exactly like this a few days ago, I decided to buy Alan wake two. OH MY GOD IS IT SO MUCH BETTER! I’ve played about 13 hours and this is one of the best games I’ve played. You gotta check it out
Haven't hopped on 2 yet. Trying to convince myself to complete Remaster atm... With limited success. Just finished the first chapter only to learn that a whole bunch of manuscript pages are not accessible on anything other than nightmare difficulty. I've heard that nightmare is... Not the most enjoyable experience (lots of bullet sponge enemies as the primary way to incentivize you to conserve ammo by evading/running). This has sort of killed my enthusiasm for completing remaster since I actually did care about getting collectibles over on control and I actually did make an effort to sit down and engage with collectibles. Remaster's manuscripts, radios and night springs episodes are great! But it kills me that I can't access a good deal of the manuscript content without playing nightmare. Moreover, it seems like I'm gated from nightmare for a first play through. I love the universe but I just don't have time like that to play through the game twice before AW2s dlcs come out.   


Imo 1 just feels like too much of a different genre to 2. I might end up skipping it and american nightmare tbh. There are at least a few good summary videos online that I can peruse including the collectibles.
Alan Wake 1 was amazing, but Alan Wake 2 is something I have never experienced in a horror game!

Horror games usually have either only a good gameplay, or good at scaring, or good at story! But oh boy AW2 had all of them!

I am not saying AW2 is a masterpiece, but it was definitely one of the best games I have played in the last 5 years! Totally a 9/10 for me personally
Miles better. The first one was amazing, but this will likely forever be the best game I have ever played.
Alan Wake 2 is the better game. You also have to put yourself back in 2010. We have come a looooong way with narrative driven games. Alan Wake 1 was extremely unique for the time. I have fond memories trying to figure out all the plot points.
Saga’s detective stuff is literally the best detective stuff I’ve ever played in a game. Give me a completely random remedy game that’s like mind hunter or some shit and I’d be so down.
    that was the only part of the game that disappointed me to be honest. you don’t really do any actual deduction aside from just putting the pictures on the board and the conclusions she reaches all feel very obvious. i liked the presentation of it but it just felt like ticking a bunch of checkboxes to me
    You might like Twin Mirror based on this ngl.
Alan Wake 1, in all honesty, is probably tied with my least liked Remedy game alongside Quantum Break. I really liked the story and atmosphere, but the gameplay was extremely tedious even in the earlier chapters, and it doesn't really evolve or get more interesting throughout the game or its expansions.

Alan Wake 2, however, is probably one of my favorite survival horror games ever, and that's saying something about how good Resident Evil has been lately. Alan Wake had a cool premise, but the sequel elevated it in both gameplay and story-telling.
One is fun...Two is pretentious and badly flawed. Sure the acting and script are cool. But how about Casey and the fuse? How about the Euro date code? How about the  cult plot turning out how it did?

Sorry. No disrespect meant, just my two cents but one was so much fun and two was like binging a CW show. Good but not great
    The original alan wake was a action game with mediocre third person shooting and some relatively light horror elements that garnered a cult following due to unique and strange creative choices, good atmosphere and a dickish but likeable protagonist. Alan wake 2 is in another stratosphere in terms of quality. It’s a survival horror masterclass with one of the best narratives in not just video games, but popular media especially in the last 3-5 years. I genuinely don’t understand how someone could prefer the first Alan wake, it’s the equivalent of saying you prefer the first uncharted or the first mass effect but maybe even worse
        Dude I spent 45 minutes looking for that fuse.
    So either this is very lame rage bait or you...probably should think a bit more about what you've just written.
I played 2 first and am close to finishing the remaster. 2 is vastly superior in every way, glad I played it first. Remastered feels like an extremely muted version of 2.
Not only is 2 insanely good but it’s very, very different.

Just power through 1 if you have to. It’s necessary for the next experience.
Yes, it is
Yes.  By far.
As everyone already said, 2 is much better, but in regard of the 1, you'll start to put the pieces together midway through the game, at the beginning it is a little confusing, but it is meant to be like that
Absolutely 100 freakin percent yes
Thank you for this post. I just forced myself through Alan Wake and have been hoping AW2 is much better. It seems like my money/time was not wasted based on other posts. AW is definitely a 4/10 for me and not worth the time by itself.
Took me a while to get into 1, really enjoyed the story but the gameplay was meh. 2 is a different story it is absolutely breathtaking in all aspects.
honestly after playing AWR then AW2, i would suggest everyone to play AW2 first then explore the rest of the Remedy universe. the gameplay in AW/R is just too dated/fluffed even on easy to really be enjoyable. the story is carrying heavily. everything about AW2 makes you want to learn more about their universe through their other games. piecing so many things in the previous games after playing AW2 has been so much fun for me and i highly recommend others to do the same. Control is also amazing
YES!!!
Miles better imo
Yes.

Alan Wake 1 is focused and minimalist, interesting more for the questions that the player has to consider and ask themselves.

Alan Wake 2 is a maximalist, cacophony of creativity somehow coming together as intricate and specific as a jigsaw. It has more varied and committed gameplay stringing it all together.

Alan Wake 1 was a masterpiece for those who put in the work to really connect with it. Alan Wake 2 is just a masterpiece.

There's a million scenarios where Alan Wake 2 could have whiffed or missed the landing. It's a testament to everyone at Remedy that it didn't.
I played the first only recently. I have no nostalgia or good memories from it because it's so recent, and I kinda hated the first Alan wake. Alan wake 2 literally blew my mind, like how are these two games in the same franchise??
I've played AW1 through start to finish four times and have platinumed it twice (once on xbox 360, once on ps4 remastered), it's one of my favorite games of all time.

AW2 is better, and it's not close.
That's why I recommend people play AW2 first lol. It's a massive leap in quality in all departments. Plus it's designed to feed you the events of the first game through Saga Anderson who is an agent trying to make sense of everything going on. You lose very little by skipping the first game

There's a chance you won't get hooked if you start with the first game given that it's old and has many outdated game mechanics. And it would be a darn shame to miss out on the sequel which is fucking fantastic. It's a masterpiece in survival horror by all metrics

Since you already started AW keep going but keep in mind that AW2 is infinitely times better lol. Tbh there's no shame in pausing your AW playthrough and hopping on AW2, then return to AW.
Alan Wake 2 is one of the best games I’ve ever played
1,000 times, YES. They aren't even remotely the same kind of game. AW1 is like an alternate universe that AW2 uses characters from. But they really couldn't be more different, and AW2 is tremendously better.
I love the original, but I love the second one even more. They're very different games, it's hard to explain without spoiling the game
Alan Wake 1 is like a solid B movie while Alan Wake 2 is Schindler's List. The quality isn't even comparable.
The story of Alan Wake 1 is great but the gameplay is a bit dated and lacking.

Alan Wake 2 improves on all of it, the gameplay and combat is much less tedious and more responsive and engaging.

Comparatively Alan Wake 2 has a look and feel much closer to the Resident Evil 4 remake, which is good because that game also fucking slaps.
I didn’t even play the first one
Yes, to me it is.
AW2 is way above and beyond AW1. The game is truly an experience. Of all time, AW2 is second only to disco Elysium imo.
It's a ton better.  The first game is absolutely carried by its story, and it got its cult classic status because of it.  Even then, it's rough around the edges in delivery in some places.  I wouldn't be surprised if that was due to them not having enough time to make everything absolutely perfect because of troubled development tbh.  It's worth looking into Alan Wake's development if you're into that kind of thing cuz it's fucking fascinating it's as good as it is given that it was meant to be an open world game with a day/night cycle and was fully developed that way until last minute when they had to pull the plug on everything.  Usually that kind of thing leaves you with something like Balan Wonderworld, but instead we got something actually pretty good.  


Still, Alan Wake 2 is where the series feels like it's finally become realized.  That it's the game Remedy always wanted to make.  They really never lost faith in that series all those years.  It sold at a loss and in order to buy the rights back from Microsoft they needed to pay the difference in lost profits as their price.  Yet they kept putting teasers for it in their stuff anyway and went out of their way to get it back.  It just shows how much faith they had in that franchise when they could have just as well left it to die.  


I go into it's history to emphasize that they believed in the potential that series had and 2 is it fully realized, which is huge for them and huge for the fans.  2 is definitely way better.
Alan Wake 1 feels pretty janky and low budget and the gameplay systems and level design aren’t all that great. Alan Wake 2 is an infinitely better designed game and the quality of writing and presentation is also leveled up considerably.
If I was ever to suggest a play order to someone it would be:

AW2 -> AW -> AW:AN -> Control -> AW2 - Final Draft

You can also put Control at the beginning or end because of how it fits into the universe.  But I would avoid AWE before playing AW2.  Even having played AW1, AWE confused me greatly until replaying it after AW2.

I think AW2 does a much better job generating interesting lore and world building than AW.  You just need AW1 for the backstory.
Do you have to play 1 to understand 2? I'm playing 1 rn but honestly I'm not feeling it
    If you're not feeling it, watch a recap. I finish remastered last month and like you I was trying to get to the end as quick really but thats mainly because its an older game. I'm about ten hours into Alan Wake 2 and loving it, there are a good few nods to the first but nothing huge you'd miss out by not finishing AW1 (or just watching a video recap of the story)
100% better in every single way
I'm glad i beat aw 1 before playing aw 2 because 2 is just that amazing.
Control and Alan Wake 2 are AMAZING compared to AW1. Control was a very challenging and rewarding shooter with a great SPC Foundation & FBI Corporate combined aesthetic and AW2 is so meta, suspenseful, and engaging. 

Watch a recap video on AW1 and play those two games
I just played through Alan wake and control w/ all dlcs and I honestly didn't care much for Alan Wake 1 until the dlc, but Alan Wake 2 has been all killer no filler for the 15 hours I've played so far, where I would say Alan Wake 1 was like 50% filler
    Bruh how is 1 50% filler?
        I felt there was way too many combat tunnels for a game with pretty mediocre combat. Tbh most of the gameplay got very old to me. AW2 had a much better balance in this regard imo.
Yes.
Yes
It's a lot better. It also gives a lot more context to the first game (So does Control but thats another conversation) 

AW2 has a slow first hour or 2 but the story ramps up like crazy, especially during Saga's portions. It's also worth noting that Saga as a new protagonist is absolutely amazing and at times even has some of the better story beats
Alan Wake 1 was just okay for me, I liked it and stuff, but it didn’t draw me in intensely, had to watch a recap video that explained all the lore to make it make more sense. Alan Wake 2 was my game of the year and might be in my top 10 favourite games of all time, like, compared to the first game? The first game sucks in comparison, the quality jumps 100 fold.

Alan Wake 2 has really good gameplay, really good horror elements, and amazing story, like super interesting and it’s not too hard to follow either, which separates itself from the first game. I was theorizing constantly throughout playing. There’s lots of foreshadowing which makes the game feel logically consistent. I really love the gameplay though, it feels like, what it’d be like if the resident evil 2 remake had one of most engaging stories I’ve seen in a video game for a while
Alan wake 2 is MILES above the first game.  It's worth it just for the art style. Its damn incredible what they pulled off. They love true detective s1 just as much as I do :)
Yeah I just beat AW1R myself like a week ago and was honestly pretty underwhelmed. It felt like a lot of cool concepts in an ultimately let down of a package. Lots of posturing with oooo’s and aaaa’s about the spooky darkness and the mystery of it all but the story feels like it didn’t really develop all that much throughout. On top of the two dlc episodes honestly feeling like a waste of time. Just didn’t click(er, hehe) for me at all, when I was hoping it really would cause I love control and wanted to get into the whole extended remedy universe
Yeah the actual gameplay of AW1 kinda blows. Its a lot, a looooot of, go from A -> B, & enemies pop out along the way. & it has to do that stupid slow-mo zoom in, like, "oooohhh a spooky enemy, he's gonna get ya!" every single time & its literally the worst thing about the game.  


It's been a long time since Ive played through it but that feeling still burns & I have no desire to ever play it again.  


AW2 is much better. The basic shooting combat is relatively the same; but there's more exploration (not huge amount mind you, a fair bit though) more occasional puzzles plus the way the stories progress for each character is neat, where one has a bit more detective stuff going on & the other is weird horror thriller mystery shenanigans going all out.  


& no more slow-mo zooms, the game isnt scared to have an enemy pop out & slap your ass without a word this time, which is great!
I did the same. I expected to love AW1 but thought it was dated and cringe. I haven’t played AW2 yet for that reason.

Have you played The Evil Within 2? I loved that game and it was much better than the first.
Play AW1 on Easy so you can get to Control and AW2 faster and with less frustration and repetition.
    Honestly not having a hard time with 1 on normal mode. It got a bit tough in episode 1 and 2 at times but 3 was a breeze for me.

I did play through control a bit but plan to finish it too! 
Would you say there’s enough connection between control and AW2 that I should finish control before AW2 ?
        Yes, finish Control—at least the main quest line— and highly recommend the AWE DLC.
I just played through the first one and then control and now I’m playing AW2. First time through all the games. I thought AWR was okay, had some really amazing moments for sure, thought control was fantastic, and am loving AW2. Glad I played the other games though because it’s a bit confusing lol
    Would you say i should play control before starting AW2 ? 
Like would I miss out on too many references by not playing it before ?
        There’s quite a bit of tie ins and it’s actually a really fun game. One of the two DLCs is all about Alan Wake too. I’d recommend it if you can snag it cheap. It was a nice break between the two Alan wake games too
Yes, though I like both quite a bit. But I mean good studies get better over time, and it shows between these two games.
I mean if they had the idea for Alan Wake now with today's hardware it would be hard to compare. The story in the 1st was amazing and parts were unforgettable.  But the 2nd has the benefit of looking and playing amazingly. I love them both. It's almost hard to compare , even though it's the same main character and continuing of a story.  

I will also say the 2nd missed a character like Barry Wheeler.
    I'm a bit concerned that they find the story had "too little lore" in 1. It's been ages since I've played but it felt like they were constantly feeding you more information but obviously without revealing the big mystery yet.
So maybe the series is not for them 🤷

Maybe a hot take but I was very happy they didn't include Barry in part 2. Again...it's been a while but he felt as.forced comic relief to me at the time.
All three games are one story, one can’t really be played without the other
I think someone (maybe Gamespot) said AWII is an A24 horror game, whoever said that, I agreed. It may not suit everyone, some found it boring, but AWII has a lot of qualities in narrative, script, art direction, and editing (except jump scare elements which are too many for me.). The contrast between REALITY (Saga's mind place) and FICTION (Alan's storyboard) is done creatively but some may not like it. I understand complaints about detective parts, but I respect what Sam Lake tried to do.

AW2 is like a European experimental survival horror game more than AW1. AW1 is more fun to play, but I like AW2 more than AW1 just because of that.
I think the games are too different to say. I think they’re both incredible in their own right but it’s hard to compare two games 13 years apart. It’s like comparing Halo 1 to Halo 4. They’re just so different it would be really hard to say which is better. Both are incredible.
AW1'S gameplay is very repetitive and "same-y", mostly I've replayed it 50 times for the story. AW2 is WILDLY different in terms of gameplay
I found them both to be good at different things. The combat in AW1 is pretty bad and the taken ambushes over and over in the woods are annoying. Alan can't even run he's like a heavy smoker and gets tired out after a few seconds jogging. But the story and pacing I thought were pretty good. AW2 just feels so much slower paced and it takes a long time to develop because you have the detective parts and artist parts so you are constantly piecing together evidence and scenes. The combat is better and more manageable but still not ideal though in a game like this combat is probably not a priority. The last few chapters were an absolute slog for me and I only stuck with it to find out the end of the story. Overall I'd say 2 is better if you play them back to back but if you played AW1 when it first came out and the systems don't feel so dated you might have liked it more.
Ahti makes everything better.
I'd say it's almost like the difference between Half Life 1 and 2.
On the same boat as OP, recently finished Alan Wake Remastered, and despite its minor flaws, I still overall loved it. Just one question, do the DLCs as well as Control make the transition to AW2 more smooth?
The story isn't messy, it just has ALOT of symbolism going on.

So Alan Wake 2 has better gameplay, yes, but if the story for 1 is too much for you, 2 will be even worse.

To be fair, Alan Wake 1 didn't click with me until years later when I was getting my Bachelor's in creative writing. Once I was in a writer's headspace and knew alot about publishing, it clicked. There is ALOT going on in Alan Wake.
If you liked the original, AW2 would DEFINITELY blow your mind
Gameplay? No. Everything else? Yes
Yes.
They're both good games in their own way. I think that is the best way to say it. My only complaint about 2 are the jump scares.
I think both games have its qualities but you need to look at them for the year its released. AW1 is much older and was made only for Xbox360 at the time, which limited the game into going full linear with generic combat and repetitive gameplay. AW2 improved on a lot and made more risks which paid out well, being able to compete with a lot of other great games this year.
We recently played Alan wake 1 followed from aw2 and the first was a little more frustrating because of the fights but for a game from 2010 (we played the remastered) it was great. Alan wake 2 came out recently and you feel that story wise they are even but aw2 tells it storry better the ign review suits pretty good
The first game was janky yeah, but the suggestions it posed with its narrative were unique. American Nightmare added a bit more to the lore, but Control was where Remedy really ironed out the gameplay kinks while throwing in even more lore spice.

AW2 is where it ALL comes together. I very, VERY much recommend playing things in sequence if you can find the time. Soooo many shades of meaning that you'll only catch after knowing the rest of this interconnected universe.
I had the same issue and ended up just watching the Alan Wake recap made by Sam Lake
Aside from a few weird negatives like the flashlight being much worse, 2 is better in almost every way.
Just finished Alan Wake 2.

Weird, weird game.

There is a puzzle in the game to do with the moon and I legit had to cheat as couldn't figure it out :-(

But I really enjoyed it, although I can totally understand people who would avoid it like the plague.
I'm incredibly nostalgic for the first Alan Wake. The tone, the way they handled the setting, the music and everything. Alan Wake 1 is a lot more straight forward in many different regards. It's more of an action game, the story is easier to follow (though it still has its twists and turns). I think I do enjoy some of the atmosphere more in the original. It's a lot comfier in a sense. 

Alan Wake 2 is, in many ways, transgressive. It plays completely differently, twists the original story around in ways without giving definitive answers as to what was real or fake. It also lingers more on the darker aspects of the story. I always thought it strange how Alan Wake 1 has so many people die and become Taken but never really acknowledges it. Even Alan Wake 2 kind of brushes over it, but based on the amount of enemies from the first game, tons of people disappeared. Alan Wake 2 makes the bad stuff happening feel far more present and real. Yes, I think a lot of the people did disappear but Alan probably wrote it so people forgot. 

In 2, you can hear NPC's talking about their friends going missing. Important characters to 2's and 1's story die. It even plays with the idea of the titular character dying in a sense. 

1 is a lot more comfortable, 2 as a game is trying to achieve something. As another comment put it, they're night and day really. I think that's the point.
If you can, play American nightmare between them, it's a good intro to an important character
I feel like they are different enough from one another that I can’t pick love them both
I do think alan wake 2 is a better game but I think there are some things alan wake 1 does better.
Yes
Depends on your perspective. Alan Wake was groundbreaking and without it we would not have Control, Quantum Break, nor Alan Wake 2. Gameplay wise sure its the weakest link, story wise its one of the strongest. I will list in my opinion games based on the narrative alone: Control, Alan Wake 2, Alan Wake, Quantum Break. 

I will now list in my opinion based on actual gameplay: Control, Quantum Break, Alan Wake 2, Alan wake. 

Hope this helps.
yes
Graphically and mechanically, yes. Story wise, no.
AW2 is a better game in many ways, but I think most of that comes down to Remedy being a much more experienced studio at this point. Alan Wake 1 is still a really top notch game, but if you're playing on PC I would suggest avoiding the Remaster. It has some very unfortunate persistent bugs. The console versions appear to be much more stable.
Before playing AW2 play Control. Control set the bases on "how Remedy's world works" you will experience AW2 much better if you play Control first
Alan Wake 2 gets my vote both narratively and game play.
imo, as someone who played Alan Wake remaster for the first time immediately before playing Alan Wake 2.

Yes, it’s like 10 times better. Looks better, feels better, written waaay better, performances are better, the lighting is some of the best I have seen in games period. 

But that isn’t to say the first game doesn’t have aspects that it does better on its own. It’s a different game, more of an action game, less of a horror game. And I prefer horror games. AW1 has weird driving combat sequences that were kind of fun, and you have to fight inanimate objects, which at the time I found annoying- but was actually disappointed that there wasn’t at least one tractor boss in AW2.
I personally enjoyed 1 a lot more, but I think 2 is a much bigger accomplishment
Yes, easily.

Graphics, Game Design, Atmosphere, HOD... imo.
Alan Wake is like the Palm Pre and Alan Wake 2 is like apple vision pro
Alan Wake 2's story is nonsense, but it's entertaining nonsense. That said, there's no real ending to it, it just starts over. I know without playing it that the Final Draft won't deliver any further answers, so I'll pass on it. The Mr. Door stuff (obviously designed for later) was a nice tease, but if you're looking for any type of closure to any story elements, you ain't getting it with AW2. I assume they're aiming for AW3, but I'll wait to play it until I hear if it has an ending or not.
It's not even close by comparison. Even ignoring the technical achievements by Remedy here the game itself is lightyears ahead of alan wake 1. Even Control was.
I just want to ask, did I miss out on anything super important by skipping The Signal and The Writer DLC? I recently wrapped up the first game, and tried The Signal before I started playing AW2. Honestly, I was really antsy to get started on it for one. Two, The Signal is extremely frustrating. They just throw a million motherfuckers at you repeatedly. You can't outrun them, I was doing decent with ammo, but then guys would come at me from offscreen and get not one, but two hits in. Then the invisible guys? It was just too much. I uninstalled and started on 2 last night. What did I miss that may have been integral to the story?
    I actually thinks it helps if you vaguely remember your play through from 13 years ago because that’s where Alan is at too.
They're completely different games. Personally the first resonates with me more but really they're apples and oranges.
Strangely enough I preferred the 1st! Just didn’t feel like there was as much action in the 2nd and I didn’t care much for the plot thing! That’s just me but I’ve got this feeling I’m just getting old. Ever since I hit 40 I just can’t connect anymore and it really bothers me! I miss being so into a game like I was with Arkham Asylum! I’LL NEVER GIVE UP, but it feels like a lot of story games became so redundant they gave up on me! or maybe like I said I’m just getting old (for the record if feeling way is getting old then 🖕🏼)
    I’m like you with this BUT Alan Wake 2 pulled me back in.  It was one of the best games I’ve played in a LONG time.  Like years since I’ve felt this way about a game.
I just finished AW remastered last week and started 2 last night. They feel very different so far. The original Alan Wake was pretty action oriented while aw2 is much slower so far (I'm only 3 hours in). Much scarier/horror oriented and a lot more story.

I thought aw was fine as far as story goes. If you read all the manuscript pages it explains the story really well imo.
Yes. My subjective meaning is that Alan wake 2 is great. Alan wake 1 is a good story, but a waaay to long stretched game with repetitive booring gameplay.
Holy shit. This game lit. It was the first time that I regretted not paying full price for the game and playing it when it was launched.
The creators have even said what they achieved with Alan Wake 2 was what they were aiming for with the original, but budget and time constraints and other factors basically caused the first game to just become a generic action game with a cool narrative concept.

It's interesting because this is one of those times where a failure was probably the best outcome; the ideas conceived and lessons learned from developing Control along with graphical technology  being so much further along are all integral to what made this game so good.
    I'd go as far as to call Alan Wake 1 a bad action game with a cool narrative concept. Compared to Max Payne and Control, it's just so darn frustrating.
    >Budget and Time Constraints

*but because Microsoft were assholes and wanted an Xbox 360 Exclusive instead of a multiplatform game optimized for PC

Just call Microsoft out on their shit, they’re the reason things went south with Alan Wake and why we had Energizer battery and Lincoln vehicles with Microsoft Snyc as product placement. 

I still remember the Untergang film meme with Hitler that was going around about the PC release getting canned. 


The original release of Death Stranding had similar features with the Monster Energy product placement because of the Studio being small as well.
I agree. I missed one thing about Alan Wake 1 in the sequel, being able to drive to go from one location to another, with the current look it would be incredible, especially if an event occurred while driving, like a shadow in the middle of the road for example.
    That and the flashlight working (but less powerful) without concentrating were the only two things I missed.

There was some times where I wished the game was less scary (dem jump scares), but with the power of hindsight, I think it was better this way. The first game wasn't very scary at all IMO. The second game was really scary to me.

I'm glad I played through the games in release order (back to back, first time playing them all). It would have been really hard to go to either of the first two games after AW2. They feel like completely different genres, even.
Pretty much. I tried playing through the remaster and i just couldnt. AW2 is too good.
    Yeah lol, same as me. After a mind-blowing experience I‘ve bought AW1 and played like 2-3h to stop then. It wasn‘t bad, but just no comparison for me. But then I got Control and after getting used to it, I had a lot if fun either. But AW2 is on the very top of the edge.
Agreed about the flashlight. But, there is one aspect of it that is really clever. I think the scarcity of battery charges makes the game scarier. The fear of running too low on battery had me extra stressed in some parts.

Though I'm undecided on how much that improved the game. It is a horror game, so some stress is a good thing. But too much stress of the wrong kind can just be... distracting?
    I actually found myself running out of battery more in the first game than this one.
Yeah I’m a RE fan and was expecting that from the original, good to know the 2nd is more like RE
    Oh you’ll probably like it then!
    RE is better
        RE has better gameplay by far, and especially in terms of replayability.

But Alan wakes presentation and story is by far the better aspect between the two franchises.

If you want a good story, you play Alan wake, if you want good gameplay you play RE.
    RE has better combat, but on normal or hard the AW combat and inventory management can test at times.

I personally like the mood and the vibes in AW2 100% more.
Actually, Alan's part feels more like Silent Hill
    Hilariously I found it to be reminiscent of SH4 specifically
        Agreed. It is a lot like SH4.
        I agree. I thought more Silent Hill then Resident Evil. 
    I really think this is intentional. So much of AW2 builds on the players' expectations going in, and the super clear parallels to RE and SH (specifically RE4 and SH2 and 4) can't be an accident.

Think about it: Saga is a government agent sent to a small, reclusive town to investigate cult murders. When sue gets there, she discovers that the actions of the "cult" were actually the influence of an ancient dormant mind-controlling entity that's lain dormant for millennia under the nearby lake. Alan is a flawed husband who is navigating a city/hall of mirrors, populated by grotesque representations of his personal trauma, on a quest to find his wife, who is leaving clues to help him to conquer his ugly past and their damaged relationship to escape >!despite her apparently being dead.!< Those are the plots of RE4 and SH2.
And the Taken don't say funny things while they're chasing you :(

Exactly. They’re so very different. I love both for different reasons. The first one feels more twin peaks style and silly. The second game is like well there’s no silent hill anytime soon, so here ya go champ.
    the second one feels more like twin peaks fire walk with me or season 3 i think. the first is definitely riffing on the original 2 seasons without any of the really horrifying elements.
    It’s definitely a send up to Silent Hill 2, which is perfect.
        The godda@@ shadows whispering in the second game were awful lol. They made my stomach knot up.
I’d say it gets crazier. First game was a lot more tame imo, especially when comparing to Alan’s side lol Saga’s is pretty decent to grasp after looking into things tho
From a story perspective, maybe.

&#x200B;

Gameplay wise? Not at all.
I love crazy stories but it needs enough lore so it actually makes sense and feel plausible in a way. Glad AW2 does that! 

I love RE games so huge plus that it’s more of a survival horror
    It's not going to be a straightforward coheritive storyline if that's what you're expecting. And that's the beauty and magic of both games. I actually prefer the storytelling of one because I'm a huge Twin peaks fan and that was the whole pull of it for me.

Two at times is even more ambiguous and not straightforward. There's a million comparative parallels to Twin peaks in the first game as are in two but I would say two is far more like an a24 horror movie. Really wacky goofy crazy shit going on if you're not into it I don't think it's going to be for you either. 

If you like movies like hereditary the lighthouse the witch etc if that's not your kind of horror this will not be your kind of horror.
    I would say AW2 is less RE and more Silent Hill.  Having said that, a lot of it's gameplay mechanics like the crime wall, where you can literally go into the protagonists mind palace and and break down the plot/crime, piece by piece. I haven't really seen that in a game before.
    I will note that the Remedyverse is vast, so, for the best experience, playing or at least watching all games is a must. Even Alan Wake American Nightmare and Quantum Break, which are foundational for AW2. Each game gives more and more lore crumbs, and it adds up, though Remedy made a good job in having AW2 stand on its own, so you don't NEED to see it all for a good experience.

Also, there is more lore out in special places. Check out This House of Dreams. It's a blog that connects AW and Control.
It wasn’t necessary how out there it was but that it felt messy. Too little explanation and lore building that would make the crazy stuff feel somewhat real. 

Ive played control a little and its world is also crazy but it  builds on it with lore. It gives some explaining for some of the crazy things.
The pace was also faster
Agreed
I can see that, nostalgia def plays a huge role in how we think of games!
    I think it is funny that I can barely remember what I ate for lunch yesterday, but I remember my all nighter playing alan wake on release night, and the same with skyrim on release night.
Totally agree. The story, atmosphere, characters, etc in AW1 were significantly better. I especially missed Barry and the Night Springs TV show.
You'd need to elaborate on that one as it's quite the hot take :D
    Let me preface this by saying Alan Wake 1&2 are my #1&2 favorite games of all time, so I'm not saying 2 is bad.

Both are completely different games with different atmospheres. While not as detailed I liked the openness of 1, it felt like a vast open real world even if you couldn't explore it all, but being able to look out into the canyons and mountains always gave me a sense of awe. 2 is a more cramped and claustrophobic atmosphere, which isn't bad and works better for the more horror aspects of the game. 


Personally while 1's gameplay was a little samey and repetitive, it was consistent and pretty fun. While 2 is improved in some ways, I also found it less consistent and more frustrating at times, especially the flashlight regard. Though infinite running is way more fun than 1. 
I also wish we got to see more of Bright falls in 2, like in 1. 


1's vibe was also weird, charming, and sinister all wrapped in one, while 2 is more weird and straight up horror, I just prefer 1 a little more. 


Saga and the Koskella Brothers were great additions, but no Barry. 
And I absolutely loved finding and watching the Night Springs episodes in 1.

There are a lot of things I like about 2 better as well, but this is just about 1.
        Thanks for taking the time to give a detailed breakdown. While I don't agree with all of it there's lots of understandable takes.

I never knew Barry was such a fan favorite. I found him pretty annoying back when I played it at release time. 😐 Seems like I'm the odd one out and cool to see how many people liked him.

"...always gave me a sense of AWE" - don't think you did that on purpose but it's brilliant none the less 😅

The only point where I fully agree is that it's sad that they removed a lot of the charming "twin peaks" weirdness from part 1. 
That's maybe the only point where I really think 1 was superior.
that was the only part of the game that disappointed me to be honest. you don’t really do any actual deduction aside from just putting the pictures on the board and the conclusions she reaches all feel very obvious. i liked the presentation of it but it just felt like ticking a bunch of checkboxes to me
You might like Twin Mirror based on this ngl.
The original alan wake was a action game with mediocre third person shooting and some relatively light horror elements that garnered a cult following due to unique and strange creative choices, good atmosphere and a dickish but likeable protagonist. Alan wake 2 is in another stratosphere in terms of quality. It’s a survival horror masterclass with one of the best narratives in not just video games, but popular media especially in the last 3-5 years. I genuinely don’t understand how someone could prefer the first Alan wake, it’s the equivalent of saying you prefer the first uncharted or the first mass effect but maybe even worse
    Dude I spent 45 minutes looking for that fuse.
So either this is very lame rage bait or you...probably should think a bit more about what you've just written.
If you're not feeling it, watch a recap. I finish remastered last month and like you I was trying to get to the end as quick really but thats mainly because its an older game. I'm about ten hours into Alan Wake 2 and loving it, there are a good few nods to the first but nothing huge you'd miss out by not finishing AW1 (or just watching a video recap of the story)
Bruh how is 1 50% filler?
    I felt there was way too many combat tunnels for a game with pretty mediocre combat. Tbh most of the gameplay got very old to me. AW2 had a much better balance in this regard imo.
Honestly not having a hard time with 1 on normal mode. It got a bit tough in episode 1 and 2 at times but 3 was a breeze for me.

I did play through control a bit but plan to finish it too! 
Would you say there’s enough connection between control and AW2 that I should finish control before AW2 ?
    Yes, finish Control—at least the main quest line— and highly recommend the AWE DLC.
Would you say i should play control before starting AW2 ? 
Like would I miss out on too many references by not playing it before ?
    There’s quite a bit of tie ins and it’s actually a really fun game. One of the two DLCs is all about Alan Wake too. I’d recommend it if you can snag it cheap. It was a nice break between the two Alan wake games too
I'm a bit concerned that they find the story had "too little lore" in 1. It's been ages since I've played but it felt like they were constantly feeding you more information but obviously without revealing the big mystery yet.
So maybe the series is not for them 🤷

Maybe a hot take but I was very happy they didn't include Barry in part 2. Again...it's been a while but he felt as.forced comic relief to me at the time.
I actually thinks it helps if you vaguely remember your play through from 13 years ago because that’s where Alan is at too.
I’m like you with this BUT Alan Wake 2 pulled me back in.  It was one of the best games I’ve played in a LONG time.  Like years since I’ve felt this way about a game.
I'd go as far as to call Alan Wake 1 a bad action game with a cool narrative concept. Compared to Max Payne and Control, it's just so darn frustrating.
>Budget and Time Constraints

*but because Microsoft were assholes and wanted an Xbox 360 Exclusive instead of a multiplatform game optimized for PC

Just call Microsoft out on their shit, they’re the reason things went south with Alan Wake and why we had Energizer battery and Lincoln vehicles with Microsoft Snyc as product placement. 

I still remember the Untergang film meme with Hitler that was going around about the PC release getting canned. 


The original release of Death Stranding had similar features with the Monster Energy product placement because of the Studio being small as well.
That and the flashlight working (but less powerful) without concentrating were the only two things I missed.

There was some times where I wished the game was less scary (dem jump scares), but with the power of hindsight, I think it was better this way. The first game wasn't very scary at all IMO. The second game was really scary to me.

I'm glad I played through the games in release order (back to back, first time playing them all). It would have been really hard to go to either of the first two games after AW2. They feel like completely different genres, even.
Yeah lol, same as me. After a mind-blowing experience I‘ve bought AW1 and played like 2-3h to stop then. It wasn‘t bad, but just no comparison for me. But then I got Control and after getting used to it, I had a lot if fun either. But AW2 is on the very top of the edge.
I actually found myself running out of battery more in the first game than this one.
Oh you’ll probably like it then!
RE is better
    RE has better gameplay by far, and especially in terms of replayability.

But Alan wakes presentation and story is by far the better aspect between the two franchises.

If you want a good story, you play Alan wake, if you want good gameplay you play RE.
RE has better combat, but on normal or hard the AW combat and inventory management can test at times.

I personally like the mood and the vibes in AW2 100% more.
Hilariously I found it to be reminiscent of SH4 specifically
    Agreed. It is a lot like SH4.
    I agree. I thought more Silent Hill then Resident Evil. 
I really think this is intentional. So much of AW2 builds on the players' expectations going in, and the super clear parallels to RE and SH (specifically RE4 and SH2 and 4) can't be an accident.

Think about it: Saga is a government agent sent to a small, reclusive town to investigate cult murders. When sue gets there, she discovers that the actions of the "cult" were actually the influence of an ancient dormant mind-controlling entity that's lain dormant for millennia under the nearby lake. Alan is a flawed husband who is navigating a city/hall of mirrors, populated by grotesque representations of his personal trauma, on a quest to find his wife, who is leaving clues to help him to conquer his ugly past and their damaged relationship to escape >!despite her apparently being dead.!< Those are the plots of RE4 and SH2.

I'M DROWNING
the second one feels more like twin peaks fire walk with me or season 3 i think. the first is definitely riffing on the original 2 seasons without any of the really horrifying elements.
It’s definitely a send up to Silent Hill 2, which is perfect.
    The godda@@ shadows whispering in the second game were awful lol. They made my stomach knot up.
It's not going to be a straightforward coheritive storyline if that's what you're expecting. And that's the beauty and magic of both games. I actually prefer the storytelling of one because I'm a huge Twin peaks fan and that was the whole pull of it for me.

Two at times is even more ambiguous and not straightforward. There's a million comparative parallels to Twin peaks in the first game as are in two but I would say two is far more like an a24 horror movie. Really wacky goofy crazy shit going on if you're not into it I don't think it's going to be for you either. 

If you like movies like hereditary the lighthouse the witch etc if that's not your kind of horror this will not be your kind of horror.
I would say AW2 is less RE and more Silent Hill.  Having said that, a lot of it's gameplay mechanics like the crime wall, where you can literally go into the protagonists mind palace and and break down the plot/crime, piece by piece. I haven't really seen that in a game before.
I will note that the Remedyverse is vast, so, for the best experience, playing or at least watching all games is a must. Even Alan Wake American Nightmare and Quantum Break, which are foundational for AW2. Each game gives more and more lore crumbs, and it adds up, though Remedy made a good job in having AW2 stand on its own, so you don't NEED to see it all for a good experience.

Also, there is more lore out in special places. Check out This House of Dreams. It's a blog that connects AW and Control.
I think it is funny that I can barely remember what I ate for lunch yesterday, but I remember my all nighter playing alan wake on release night, and the same with skyrim on release night.
Let me preface this by saying Alan Wake 1&2 are my #1&2 favorite games of all time, so I'm not saying 2 is bad.

Both are completely different games with different atmospheres. While not as detailed I liked the openness of 1, it felt like a vast open real world even if you couldn't explore it all, but being able to look out into the canyons and mountains always gave me a sense of awe. 2 is a more cramped and claustrophobic atmosphere, which isn't bad and works better for the more horror aspects of the game. 


Personally while 1's gameplay was a little samey and repetitive, it was consistent and pretty fun. While 2 is improved in some ways, I also found it less consistent and more frustrating at times, especially the flashlight regard. Though infinite running is way more fun than 1. 
I also wish we got to see more of Bright falls in 2, like in 1. 


1's vibe was also weird, charming, and sinister all wrapped in one, while 2 is more weird and straight up horror, I just prefer 1 a little more. 


Saga and the Koskella Brothers were great additions, but no Barry. 
And I absolutely loved finding and watching the Night Springs episodes in 1.

There are a lot of things I like about 2 better as well, but this is just about 1.
    Thanks for taking the time to give a detailed breakdown. While I don't agree with all of it there's lots of understandable takes.

I never knew Barry was such a fan favorite. I found him pretty annoying back when I played it at release time. 😐 Seems like I'm the odd one out and cool to see how many people liked him.

"...always gave me a sense of AWE" - don't think you did that on purpose but it's brilliant none the less 😅

The only point where I fully agree is that it's sad that they removed a lot of the charming "twin peaks" weirdness from part 1. 
That's maybe the only point where I really think 1 was superior.
Dude I spent 45 minutes looking for that fuse.
I felt there was way too many combat tunnels for a game with pretty mediocre combat. Tbh most of the gameplay got very old to me. AW2 had a much better balance in this regard imo.
Yes, finish Control—at least the main quest line— and highly recommend the AWE DLC.

If you want a good story, you play Alan wake, if you want good gameplay you play RE.
