[[Do I need to complete my community center by year 3]]


Hi! I've been a lurker on this subreddit for a good amount of time now and decided to REALLY get into stardew again because of it. I've seen alot og posts, on here and from other sites, that say I should really complete the community center(cc for short from now on) by then. But...do I need to? I'm loving the game so much but I keep getting this anxiety from being halfway done with year two and NOT having the cc done. I'm AWFUL at fishing and have been buying the fish and water items that I need from the traveling cart person. People I've talked to about this said I shouldn't be feeling anxiety at all but they're also the ones telling me that I need to finish by then. I just want to enjoy my game with peace of mind and not feeling like I have to rush yknow?


If you donâ€™t finish in 3 years, concernedape comes to your house and pees in your ice cube trays. Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve heard
    No wonder the mobile 1.5 update is taking so long. He's just crossing the world, pissing in trays
    nah im in year 5 and not done, he kidnapped my hamster
        Year 6 He stole my Soap
            "And worst of all, he stole my soap! Who steals soap?"
    So thats why my iced coffee tasted to so weird today
        Drink it faster than the pee cubes melt
There is 0 time limit. Literally take all the time you want. If you wanted to wait till year 20 to finish CC, you could. Nothing will punish you.
    Or go with Joja in a new save.

I like Joja run.
Once you unlock Krobus you can buy fish from him on Wednesdays. He got me through the fishing part.
    TIL
    Also caravan fish
    Whaaaaa???? I grinder that shit for YEARS because I didnâ€™t know certain fish were only out at certain times of the year
There is absolutely no rush or time limit. The game is designed to go at your pace, no one else's so you can play however you want. You absolutely do not have to have it finished at any point in time as long as you are having fun. Everything always comes back around so if you miss something you can always do it the next year, it's pretty much an infinite game! :)
Just enjoy your game at your own pace. I'm also in my first playthrough in year 2 spring 12...and also had the feeling of not doing things well. (Like i hate the mines...those flying bugs annoy me so much that i am only level 18,  some.people have reached the skull cavern already in year 2)
But then I realised,  it's your own game,  your farm - don't compare to others and have a relaxing fun time. Thats whats Stardew all about.
I took 7 years to finish the community center and like 16 years to finish the museum.  Take your time.  Don't stress.
    But when did you get large milk?
        That wasn't a problem for me.  My problem was getting all the fish I needed.
I think I took 6 years my first play though. I didnâ€™t even notice that I got a harsh assessment until I got a better assessment later.
I did mine Winter 17 Y2. Completing by Y3 guarantees Grandpa's approval. 4 candles will light up on his grave, and you get the iridium cat, which means free ore every day.
    So when can I get 4 candles? I didnâ€™t know about this. I only got 3
        You can try again by putting a diamond in Grandpa's shrine. Completing the community centre usually does it for me, but you do you.
            Oh he comes back to like reassess?
    You donâ€™t actually have to finish the community center to get his approval, and finishing it will not guarantee his approval.  Finishing the CC and watching the cutscene for finishing it are only one point each.  There are plenty of other ways to get 4 candles by the beginning of year 3.  And as InvisibleScorpiom7 already mentioned, you can get reassessed at anytime by giving the grave a diamond.
Thereâ€™s no rush!! >! I know per the note on grandpaâ€™s shrine says heâ€™ll return then, but he can be re-summoned at any time! !<
    Wait he can??
        Putting a diamond on his shrine summons him again
        Yes!
not at all. the community centre, along with a lot of other things doesnt have a required finished date. itâ€™s optimal to finish it as soon as u can as it means u get all the end game content sooner and ppl also like see how quickly they can finish the CC but if it takes u 10+years thereâ€™s nothing wrong with that either
Take your time! Play the game so itâ€™s fun for you and donâ€™t worry about anything else. 

If fishing is causing you trouble, buy the training rod from Willy. It can only catch the easiest fish and will help you level up your fishing skill. The higher your skill level the easier it is to fish.
There is zero time limit. Ideally completing it in one year is best so you can get into all the rest of the game. Iâ€™d say year 2 summer if youâ€™re not lucky with the Red Cabbage. But no rush. I think my first run of the game took me like three years.
The new thing about this game is that there's no stress unless you impose it on yourself. I like to complete the greenhouse by the 1st winter at least but it's usually the quality crop bundle that trips me up. It's very gratifying to complete the CC but there is no time limit. 

 Even if you don't get the best evaluation at the end of the 2nd year, you can try again when you are ready! 

 Fishing tripped me up the 1st time. I went to the traveling merchant every Friday & Sunday plus checked trash cans for fish.  I also put out lots of crab pots & used food buffs when I tried to fish. It's also really helpful to look up the fish you need for seasons & times available.
Just about to start year 4. Just completed the CC. I have no idea what theyâ€™re talking aboutâ€¦
I just finished the CC and it is year 6. Don't worry and stress. Just relax and enjoy.
You can take as long as you want!
They tell because stuff happens by then - but this stuff can be repeated easily

So both of their statements are true
But back to your question - do not stress at all in this game, like ever - I always stress myself but that is just the way I play games - but since you canâ€™t really fail you should just enjoy the game
I watched a challenge on YouTube where a guy tried to complete the community center without leveling up any of his skills. That meant no fishing, no foraging, no mining... he got everything he needed from the traveling cart on Friday and Sunday and from villagers as he befriended them. Pretty sure it took decades in-game. But bear in mind, completing the CC does unlock like... the entire second half of the game. 

Take it at your own pace. Fishing is terrible but it DOES get easier with buffs and lures. And if you really never want to use your pole, just make sure to hit up that cart and Krobus on I think Wednesdays, he sells one of nine fish every week (I don't know what he sells other than sturgeon and lingcod, I only go on Thursdays for the mixed seeds).

That being said, crabs and ghost fish can both be obtained from monsters in the caves, and you can knock out the crab pot bundle without even getting a crab pot. Most of the things for it can be foraged off the beach.
There's no rush. Seriously. I keep this link around whenever people ask this sort of thing.

Honestly kind of regret finishing the CC cause Clint leaves on Fridays ðŸ˜­ my mobile save I'm waiting on finishing it lol
No rush, but I recommend finishing the greenhouse sooner than later. Itâ€™s a big help.
