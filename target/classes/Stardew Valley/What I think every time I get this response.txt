[[What I think every time I get this response]]





I ain't wasting diamonds, booze, or maple syrup on those who don't appreciate it.
    Srsly, when I find out so-and-so is just as happy with a parsnip as with an iridium bar, well, Imma drop a parsnip in a crate to give it to them on their birthday.
        Parsnip is even better, cause you get the multiplier for higher quality.
            I did not realize this. Game changed.
                Ehh press X to doubt. Don't think that's confirmed?

Edit: It's true peeps!
                    [deleted]
                        I trust the wiki but haven't read that anywhere and I feel like I've read the dang thing page to page lol. Linky?
                            https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Friendship
                                Ahh how have I never seen that table! I keep giving them regular quality and shipping the higher quality because I thought it didn't matter.

Thanks for linking that.
                                    It did change to that but it was quite a long time ago. Originally star items didnt make a difference. So depending how long youve been playing, you were correct ar some point!
                                    Glad to help
                    George loves leeks, so when spring rolls around I grab a bunch and toss them in a chest for when I need them.
                for real
            There’s a multiplier for higher quality item gifts? Son of a bitch how long has this been a thing
        All iridium should be iridium quality.
    Thankfully only Maru doesn't want Maple Syrup.
        Maru who will probably do something very productive with the iridium bars, gold bars, and batteries she loves but will only ever get strawberries
            It's rather imbalanced that a relatively affordable strawberry gets the exact same amount of friendship as a rare and valuable iridium bar.

In fact, they get more because stars are what matters.

I'd love a rebalance that makes item value  be taken into account. Probably with some kinda "gift value" to override items that are rare, yet weirdly low sell value (1g for a dwarf scroll?).
                So you want the NPCs to be gold diggers? It simulates real life, people want gifts they enjoy.
                    I love bacon cheeseburgers. 

Not a big fan of diamonds, not much I could really do with a diamond other than sell it for face value.

If someone gifted me a bacon cheeseburger I'd be happy.

If someone gifted me a diamond I'd be ecstatic.
                        Eh, I wouldn't, but I'm quite financially secure. I can buy things I want.

Shopping sucks, I don't necessarily know what I like, so when someone gives me a gift I know that 1 I now don't need to buy it and 2 it could be something cool I'd never considered before like an author if it was a book.

My aunt buys me like, linen every year. I love it.
                            Cool story
                                I didn't say rich, I said doing okay. My parents heading into retirement. I earn more than they do as a result and they aren't gonna be buying me a new motorbike. 

I would hope most people my age or older are at least heading in the position I'm in. You start to value time a bit more over money. Hence why things that take a lot of labour can be really nice. My house mate makes me a birthday cake every year and it's so touching. Five year old though doesn't care for the cake wants the presents because a five year old has lots of time and no money.
                    Real life. I want gifts I enjoy. If someone was to offer me then best melon I'd ever have or my dream house as a gift, I'd pick the dream house. Thats not to say I wouldn't enjoy the melon, but a house is wayyyyy more valuable. Humans are gold diggers, mostly.
                        Yeah that's extremes though.

Maybe make some more universal likes? If item is > 1000 it's a universal like/love.

Something 100g than another though I think gets really materialistic though.
                    I actually don't want it to naively go by buy or sell value. But that would be a good starting point for the "default" value.

But I mean, if stars influence how much someone loves something, then surely more valuable stuff should be liked, too? Because as it stands, any item that can't get a star is at a disadvantage. Leah loves wine, but she doesn't appreciate the difference in value between starfruit and salmonberry wine.

As an aside, I don't think appreciating value makes you a gold digger. If you *had* to give expensive items, that would make them a gold digger. But real people certainly appreciate valuable things more!
                        Yeah my initial reaction was that it was really materialistic but I think you can probably strike a balance where it's more realistic. A cyclist would be over the moon if you bought them a high end bike for example, but they're not necessarily going to like it as much if it was second hand. The quality of something is definitely a factor.
                >iridium bar

>rare and valuable

Choose one. Thing is, different items require different amounts of effort depending on where you are in the game. If I want to produce a strawberry, i still have to think one year ahead (or sacrifice indoor space), while I could give people iridium by the bucket. In the first few years, that wouldn't have been the case, of course.
                    If you don't get the statue of perfection it's rare.

Then it flips with the statue and you're drowning in it.
                    Yeah, that's unfortunately true. For the first year, iridium is almost impossibly rare. Year 2, it's not too bad, but still definitely rarer than the others. Year 3 and onward, you'll have more than you ever need.

Still, I'm not too bothered by that. It makes sense that once you're crazy rich, you can get friendship very fast. Not too different from how later on, you can get gold star produce more often and purple star forage items easily (and since things like bars don't have stars, those can be worth far more!).

And personally, I keep a bunch of produce and forage already (for gifts, quests, cooking, and crafting), so the rarity from planning thing is not particularly changing the effort it takes. I know many others do this, too.
    My Friday night of handing out prismatic shards from this week's skull cave plunder made me realise, prismatic shard is not a universal love.
        haley’s the only one who doesn’t like it. but she’s easy
    My whole town is addicted to coffee.
    I actually just gift everyone diamonds
        Beer is cheeper!
I took a wild guess that someone who likely shops at Hot Topic would be into frozen tears.
    Wow first time I’ve realized the most emo person in stardew ~~likes~~**loves** *frozen tears* I feel really dumb now...
        all foraged minerals (including frozen tears) are universal likes (w/ exceptions ofc) anyways
            Sorry, I should’ve said “loves”, everyone likes it but OF COURSE the emo kid loves em
                Also fun fact about Sebastian, during the valley fair you can see him smoking *something* with Sam.
                    also you may catch robin with the dialogue "I was washing Sebastian's ashtray today and it smelled weird. should I be worried?" my mans 420 friendly alright
                    I can't remember if it's summer or fall, but I also saw Sebastian occasionally hanging at the train station to smoke.
                        I actually just found it in game today
                    I think I remember, way back when, the blue "vase" in his room was clearly a bong... so if you ever wondered why your husband stands in front of a vase for like 5 hours a day, there you go!
                I didn't mean to nitpick btw, I genuinely thought it was just a universal like and forgot he had it as a love. my bad!
                    Oh no worries :) it’s a fun little Easter egg we all realized was right in front of us!
    He also loves pumpkin soup ..... he’s got layers!
        It’s because robin gives you the recipe for pumpkin soup, he likes his moms cooking!
            My fucking head just exploded
            Awww that’s actually really sweet<3 I didn’t know that
            I never realized that was why. That’s the cutest thing I’ve ever heard
                If you marry him he leaves the farmhouse to visit Robin once a week. If you catch him there he'll say "Mom deserves to be happy"
                    Similar thing when you marry Haley. She occasionally goes to visit Emily and Emily remarks how how they strangely became closer after Haley moved out.
    Me too. I also guessed he'd be into void eggs.
        Is he?
            Yep
    Sashimi i still don’t understand though. Guess he just likes sashimi
When I first started the game I gave Lewis a petrified slime on his birthday (everyone likes gemstones right?). I was SO confused by his response until I realized days later that geode minerals are a dislike for everyone. WHOOPS
    I just grew my own flower and gave it to someone for them to be disgusted with it. Feels bad man.
        I have ongoing beef with Elliot because he was repulsed by vegetables I grew myself for him. I refuse to attend his book reading until he apologises
            He’s a man of expensive tastes! He even likes fruits and flowers as long as they weren’t foraged. No roadside berries for my man!
                He can get the shells I find on the beach and be happy with them!! 

Shane literally accepts cola I find in the trash and Elliot is rejecting my home grown produce. Upsetting.
                    [deleted]
                        Like my real life husband, I just wish he’d clean his room.
                            There's a mod for that.
                                Omg really!  Too bad I already divorced him over it.
                        I gave shane like 10 things he likes and he still asks me why im talking to him screw shane lol
                            He warms up after you get a few hearts, and his events are great.
                I totally didn’t realize it but you are so right. Pomegranates, duck feathers, and crab cakes?? The man has a store and it sure isn’t Walmart.

I showed my brother Elliott’s picture when I married him and my brother said, “Why did you marry Fabio?” Served me right, Elliot never helped on the farm.
                    Oh God I'm not the only one who calls him Fabio?
                        It’s truly the perfect nickname for him :)
                Huh. And I thought he got along with Leah, who likes foraged stuff.
                Gnome doesn’t understand, AMA
            Oh my god. I just read this and realized that I forgot to go to it! I was playing last night and was pretty tired so I just finished the day I was on and went to bed! Do I have another chance or will he hate me forever? I’m trying to date every bachelor/ette, except for one of each, so I can avoid the group ten heart event. That’ll work...right?
                You can go to his book reading any afternoon! 

If you want to avoid the 10 heart event you could date everyone but also carry a rabbits foot.
                    [deleted]
                        In the alternative events the NPCs don't get angry with you though so there's no negative effect
            That’s weird because I used to give Elliot vegetables all the time and he liked them.
        Bruh this made me crack up. I feel you
        When I played today, Jodi invited me to dinner, asking me to bring a largemouth bass. It took a while, but I fished up a gold star bass. Went home, did all my chores, and remembered at 7:10 that dinner was at 7. 

Reset the day, do the same stuff, get to Jodi's house at 5:30. I give her my only bass. For dinner. My only bass that she asked me to bring. 

"Hmm, well I guess I could always put this in the compost..."


...bitch.
            You need to trigger the event lmao. You didn't even need to restart the day you could have just gone inside the event would have triggered. You'll get em next time champ.
                Also, when you get an invitation to be at a place at a certain time, they sometimes say "tonight" but you can trigger the event any day you like by going to the location at the specified time. Doesn't need to be exact either, I've been like an hour late and the event still triggers.
            It doesn't help that the tag line.
        Was walking to the mine and saw a daffodil and that would be worth a few extra foraging points. What do you know an NPC was walking by so I thought what the hell have I got to loose. Turns out they really liked it.
        Let me quess, Poppy?
    Bruh. Shane gave me the Strange Bun recipe and asks if he can try it if you make one, but when I gave it to him his response was "Why are you giving me your trash?"

Ultimate Betrayal.
        Uff.. he set you up
        This made me so mad! I was so excited to give it to him, I had just gotten to the point where he starts being nice. It really hurt.
        He's done this to me with stuff I KNOW he likes. It stops once you get past 6(?) hearts with him.
            He was my husband in my first save so I have a soft spot for him and try to take care of him even when I marry different people in other saves, but my GOD I forgot how mean he is in the beginning.
    I assumed the dwarf would like dwarf artifacts! Why does the dwarf hate his own culture and past?!
        I mean, I wouldn't like getting swamped with two human artifacts every week...
        He do like scrolls tho....
    Gave the old man like a quartz for his birthday. I had a lot, I was trying to whoo Sebby, and he fucking hated it. Lost all 3 hearts with him that took me a year in game to get naturally.
        Just give that old man leeks. He fucking loves leeks. I’m level ten in foraging so I just keep giving him iridium quality leeks and he basically treats me like his granddaughter.
        George is so easy to win over though once you realise of all >!foraged edibles!< he only dislike/hates, like, 3 of them.
    My first week playing I would hold random items and I would talk to villagers to get my friendship up, but I’d always give me stuff away and it was ALWAYS CLAY and I kept forgetting to put it away before I talk to them.
The little aliens hidden in the title screen told me, Seb.
It's right up there with Bulbapedia for the top tier gaming wikis.
    Also the TBoI and Enter the Gungeon wikis
        Don't forget uesp!
            And the Terraria Wiki. I can’t imagine beating the game without it. Now if you want a game where you lean on the wiki HARD then try Terraria with the Calamity mod.
for real, though! gets old giving someone something you'd logically expect them to like and they just go "meh..."
    I got lucky cause the first person I tried that with was Abigail and Amethyst (the hair, ya feel?) and then it never happened again....
        There’s always Haley and daffodils. Nice when you’re just starting out and have no kitchen or gems.
            And George with leeks. And Linus with just about everything.
                I just assumed "Linus wants food, right? I'll give him anything I have that he can eat."
                    Except carp. He gets downright offended over carp.
                        The very first gift I gave was after a Linus quest. He asked for algae and I thought, maybe he'll want another one. Nope, that second algae was total garbage.
                            I’ve done the same thing! These fake people are strange lol
                        I gave him a field snack and he hated it.
                    You can’t give him field snacks or snails. Wiki said something about fish and in parentheses it said except Linus and snails. I can’t see worth’s shit sometimes so I assumed it meant he loved snails. The man almost cried. He said “you think because I live in a tent I deserve to eat trash?” I felt so bad!  He also hates gold. I keep picturing Ted Kaczynski. He’s a hermit not really a hobo. He’s a good friend to have
                        I would've married Linus if I could lol. He's one philosophical man lol he's so nice too. I hate how he feels that everyone dislikes him :( issa okay i'll keep giving some food. most appreciative man ever
            Good girl Haley wanting sunflowers in Summer/Fall and daffodils in spring.
            i gave Haley a potato on her birthday because i couldn’t find any flowers and she was so upset.
                LMFAO. Imagine this happening in real life. You're just minding your own business walking about enjoying life and your birthday. Surprise potato! 

How would you react?
                    Was on a competitive dance team in college.

My last competition ever we were gifted a potato by a different team that had 'potato' in their team name. We carried around the potato all weekend and brought it back to our campus 200+ miles away.
                    My dogs are named Potato and Baby Yams. I would be ecstatic!

        [deleted]
            Was brand new to the game and hadn't spend much time on here or found the wiki yet. Got amethyst on my first trip into the mines and was like huh, Abigail has purple hair (my character is also purple) let's see what happens. She loved it, been a true love story ever since.
Once I gave linus some trash thinking he could make it into something cool and he hated me for it. He asked me if I thought he deserved trash because he was homeless.  Not gonna lie I restarted the game. MY INTENTIONS WERE GOOD I SWEAR.
    I can’t stop laughing thinking about you thinking a guy living in the woods wants some literal trash.
        I KNOW OKAY. Definitely did not think that through! My partner who also plays mocked me relentlessly for it. Me and linus are best friends in my new game to atone for my sins.
            He forgives you, it's okay!!

Me, my feelings were hurt because I worked hard for that. Also, I think it was a fish. Linus? Do you not wanna eat?
                He may forgive but I will never forget.
            Linus and George are always the first people I friend. The single folk can wait; I need me some >!wild bait!< and >!spicy eel!<! The latter is more or less the only thing I eat late game. My breath is probably amazing.
    Unrelated, but does anyone else feel kind of bad taking forageables from the mountains? Especially during berry season when I rob the mountain of all its natural resources, I can’t help thinking about poor Linus digging through trash for food :(
        I never even thought about it. I guess I assumed hes okay because I give him gifts as often as I can.
            I answered a Help Wanted for Linus once, he wanted a diamond and paid me two grand for it - I think he's doing just fine.
                LOL. Will I ever come to understand that man? :’)
It's going to be super interesting when we find out we are all in a simulation. I'm going to ask my real life (simulation) boyfriend how he knows I like gummy candy and he is going to show me a projection of the Earth Wikipedia...where my preferences are gummy candy, Stardew Valley, and season tickets to amusement parks.
    We have facebook and google doing that now basically.
        “Schedule: 7-8 AM in room on phone”
    Mine will be cocaine, pizza, and tickets to Wimbledon
        One of these things is clearly not like the others.
            Well ripping fat lines while watching a jolly old tennis match clearly go together so I guess you mean the pizza?
                Actually yes.
Or alternatively "because I've given you 10 of them and you keep asking me..."
    Or, “We’ve been married for 4 years.”
    I have started saying out loud "Maybe because I've given you a dozen sashimi so far?!?" I'm glad someone else feels this way haha.
        My outloud comment is, "I read it on the wiki." Say it all the time.
It'd be funny if they start to notice that you're only giving them their favorites as gifts and freak out. One day you'll pass by a window and hear them chatting about you "Don't you think its weird that he worked for Joja, shows up in town out of the blue, and starts giving us each our favorite foods from Day 1, not knowing anything about us? I'd swear this is a [Joja data mining operation...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX4JErnGUlE)"
Sebastian dear,  we've been married for four years and you still ask that question every time?  Haha. Not that I'm complaining, I just wish their dialogues also change when you're married.
    This is an upgrade I am waiting for fervently. It'll remake the game for me entirely. Not that I don't keep discovering new things STILL after multiple save files with multiple years... but tbh I end up getting bored with my husband/wife after a while and I feel bad about it :(.
    I've been giving him sashimi for breakfast ever since I married him and his genuine surprise cracks me up every single time.
I was mad when I gave Abigail a diamond and all she said was “Thanks for this, how’d you know I was hungry”. I thought she’d love it along side Amethyst, but nooooo. She exclusively loves Amethyst in the gem department.
    I know right? I gave her quartz once,  and she gave me that "how'd you know I was hungry? " and I'm like "Bitch, whaaa??" I guess she love munching on rocks. Amethyst is her favorite tho. Love that tasty purple crystal
        Quartz is honestly one of the best generic gifts to give to people. It’s in like, half the town’s likes and neutral for the rest.
            [deleted]
                Oh. Did not know that. I guess I just get lucky with whoever I give it to.
                    Im guessing you stumble upon Marnie a lot? Whenever I need to do the shorts quest I stock up on quartz to give her cause its a cheap easy find that I already stock up on.
        This is actually lampshaded in-game: if you talk to Abigail when you're married, she'll sometimes say, "going to the mines? If you find anything tasty, dont forget to break me off a piece!" or something similar. 

Also a secret note reveals that she actually loves amethyst because she likes to sleep with them under her pillow. Probably some crystal healing thing.
Imagine if this happened in real life. "Oh, I checked your Wikipedia entry," and so you go look and there it is. Your complete schedule for the next year, including exceptions. A list of all of your likes and dislikes for basically every conceivable gift. A guide to romance that lists every secret and significant event you and your spouse went through.
    Finally, I can stop having to plan what I'm going to every day and just check my Wiki instead!
        fun fact of the day?
Frozen tears led to me marrying him 🤷🏻‍♀️😂
    Through sweat and frozen tears...
        Best reply ever 😂
Don't forget the Secret Notes.
Big ups to the people maintaining the wikia pages for games. Thank you for all of the great work you do.
I love that this is still his dialogue after marriage. You know. Three years of marriage. After I courted him for a while. Constantly gave him the exact same thing. Just saying, Sebastian. Just saying.
My 6th chrome bookmark
I accidentally gift bait when I go around town visiting my crab pots...
    I've done this with several different items. Once made Clint depressed by accidentally gifting him copper ore...
        I had this happen when I tried to give Willie a squid for his quest. He asked for a squid and i didn't know there were two kinds. Gave him the exotic one which I only had one of and he's all urgh, what is this?! I was confused until I went to read the wiki...
            Exact same thing happened to me for the squid quest! So frustrating, especially in early game 🙃
        To be fair, Clint is already depressed...
I always feel really bad for using the wiki for this stuff (kinda feels like cheating) but I also never seem to have enough patience to do trial and error with every freaking item on every freaking townspeople.
    I mean, there is a way of finding out eventually, but I don't think its triggered until your first winter.
        What way?
            You know, it's really strange, but I can't remember now. I think it might have had something to do with the latest update. Sorry!
For me it's usually, "Well, we've been married for years now"
It's been months since I played and the Villagers wiki page still pops up on my under the search bar when I go to Google.
Demetrius I only give you strawberries so you'll send me a nautilus shell so that I can finally expand my caviar empire
I’ve held back from referring to any wiki stuff so I can discover things organically. I’m seriously considering changing that so I stop selling stuff that could be useful later.
    Just hoard one or three of everything and you'll be fine!
I know what you like Sebastian because of the wiki page dedicated to you and I have been in your basement I mean bedroom.
Literally have his wiki page pinned....
LOL SAME. I literally always think that!!!!!!!!
Hahaha this has really made me giggle!
WHY IS THERE NO SHADING ON THE WORD "WIKI"?! I knew something was of. Cursed. Please fix people who made this.
The internet has been a double edged sword for gaming.  On one hand, infinite knowledge and community.  On the other hand -- the internet has ruined an aspect of gaming people have forgotten - being genuinely surprised or satisfied when you uncover a secret, or discover the solution to a puzzle you didn't even know you were solving.  As a result of the immediate access of all spoilers and information, developers as a result have been putting less and less of them in their game as well.

This is less about Stardew Valley, and more just a place I randomly got on my soapbox.
    I agree with you. I try to limit myself on Wiki info (though I do use it for gifts), because I like uncovering the little gems throughout the game.
“Because I’m fucking stalking you”
My time on wiki is spent looking up where some of these people are hiding. Gus, Pam, Elliot, Emily and Shane, easiest full hearts.
Sebastian is so cute ugh
Omg meeee
To be honest most of the time i just think "I've been giving you the same kind of gift for 3 years now..."
What was his name?
Okay I have tried SO HARD to not look at the wiki for him... Yet to maintain one heart for more than a week 🤣😭
    You're stronger than I am. If it's any consolation, there should come a point where you start finding "hints" (I won't say anything more)
Well now I feel like a stalker.
Because I've been giving you sashimi for 3 years (our real years) is how I know.
Lmaooooooo yup
Same XD
Because I gave you the same thing yesterday, and I give you the same thing every time! Seriously sometimes I just imagine the NPCs drowning in the stuff I give them, especially if it's not food. Abigail's whole room just stuffed with amethyst...
>I know all your locations at every hour

I mean what?
Why do I know where you are every hour of the day despite this being my second week here? it’s uhhhhh not important
Ok so I decided I’m going to start using this - I want to make Seb my boyfriend (I found out he is single last night haha) so I gifted him some ARTISAN HOMEMADE MAYO and you know what? He hated it. Fuck you Seb! I’ll still get you though haha
I'm in this photo and I don't like it.
Wouldn't it be great if there was a wiki like this for all of your friends and family in real life? Not saying I don't know them well enough, just that sometimes people can surprise you
The fattest mood in the universe
litterally every single time and I'm just like



well I married you over 20 years ago
I’m your wife.
Every time he says this I say “because I love you” out loud
I’m on my first play through, I have yet to use the wiki but gifting apparently doesn’t come naturally to me, so I may have to start
My only guide
I kinda miss the days before I knew about the wiki. I did a ton of things "wrong" but it just felt so fresh and relaxing. Nowadays I'm all about the min-maxing, but it isn't the same.
and the friendship menu that helpfully provides a way to quantify your love
The wiki
My first playthrough of stardew valley is without a guide. From experience with playing harvest moon, I find that flower is a safe bet haha.
Life would be much easier if we could acces our wiki!
Lmao we're married and I give him sashimi every morning. He always says this.

Like babe we've been married for a year and a half.
I found a random paper on the ground with all of your deepest desires written on it
Me when I started: I will discover everyone’s likes and dislikes by trial and error! 
Me now: wiki says Elliott wants a lobster so by god he will get a lobster
I don't know why my brain made the Law & Order sound for this
    This made me giggle
I try to avoid the wiki at all costs so when I learned Shane like spicy stuff by constantly talking to him every day I felt like a champ
Nah, I got it from the secret note... which if found using the wiki.
Ok, so she’ll get it wrong.*
Wiki is the new prima guide. Anyone remember prima? Just me? Fuck I'm old
    I'm still angry about the Bradygames guide for FFIX.
Why is Hitler a fetish in this fandom
lol you read my comment and then made this didn’t you
    Nope! Purely coincidence.
        well, i still thought of it first
My girlfriend just got married with Sebastian.
I've never played Stardew Valley but I feel betrayed, should I reconsider my relationship?
    I'm sorry she has moved on 😔
    I married Sebastian but only after my husband married Penny, we're even. Start the game and find yourself a wife NOW lol
I'm actually shocked how many people "cheat".  
  
I have over 400 hours in this game, and I've never once looked at the wiki, or any other site.  Every time I see a "Spoiler" tag on a post here, I pass it.  
  
I get it. But I feel 98% of the fun is figuring things out for myself.
  
I would never judge anybody, but I'm so happy I went in blind and figured (most) of it out myself.  
  
To each their own.

Srsly, when I find out so-and-so is just as happy with a parsnip as with an iridium bar, well, Imma drop a parsnip in a crate to give it to them on their birthday.
    Parsnip is even better, cause you get the multiplier for higher quality.
        I did not realize this. Game changed.
            Ehh press X to doubt. Don't think that's confirmed?

Thanks for linking that.
                                It did change to that but it was quite a long time ago. Originally star items didnt make a difference. So depending how long youve been playing, you were correct ar some point!
                                Glad to help
                George loves leeks, so when spring rolls around I grab a bunch and toss them in a chest for when I need them.
            for real
        There’s a multiplier for higher quality item gifts? Son of a bitch how long has this been a thing
    All iridium should be iridium quality.
Thankfully only Maru doesn't want Maple Syrup.
    Maru who will probably do something very productive with the iridium bars, gold bars, and batteries she loves but will only ever get strawberries
        It's rather imbalanced that a relatively affordable strawberry gets the exact same amount of friendship as a rare and valuable iridium bar.

In fact, they get more because stars are what matters.

I'd love a rebalance that makes item value  be taken into account. Probably with some kinda "gift value" to override items that are rare, yet weirdly low sell value (1g for a dwarf scroll?).
            So you want the NPCs to be gold diggers? It simulates real life, people want gifts they enjoy.
                I love bacon cheeseburgers. 

Not a big fan of diamonds, not much I could really do with a diamond other than sell it for face value.

If someone gifted me a bacon cheeseburger I'd be happy.

If someone gifted me a diamond I'd be ecstatic.
                    Eh, I wouldn't, but I'm quite financially secure. I can buy things I want.

Shopping sucks, I don't necessarily know what I like, so when someone gives me a gift I know that 1 I now don't need to buy it and 2 it could be something cool I'd never considered before like an author if it was a book.

My aunt buys me like, linen every year. I love it.
                        Cool story
                            I didn't say rich, I said doing okay. My parents heading into retirement. I earn more than they do as a result and they aren't gonna be buying me a new motorbike. 

I would hope most people my age or older are at least heading in the position I'm in. You start to value time a bit more over money. Hence why things that take a lot of labour can be really nice. My house mate makes me a birthday cake every year and it's so touching. Five year old though doesn't care for the cake wants the presents because a five year old has lots of time and no money.
                Real life. I want gifts I enjoy. If someone was to offer me then best melon I'd ever have or my dream house as a gift, I'd pick the dream house. Thats not to say I wouldn't enjoy the melon, but a house is wayyyyy more valuable. Humans are gold diggers, mostly.
                    Yeah that's extremes though.

Maybe make some more universal likes? If item is > 1000 it's a universal like/love.

Something 100g than another though I think gets really materialistic though.
                I actually don't want it to naively go by buy or sell value. But that would be a good starting point for the "default" value.

But I mean, if stars influence how much someone loves something, then surely more valuable stuff should be liked, too? Because as it stands, any item that can't get a star is at a disadvantage. Leah loves wine, but she doesn't appreciate the difference in value between starfruit and salmonberry wine.

As an aside, I don't think appreciating value makes you a gold digger. If you *had* to give expensive items, that would make them a gold digger. But real people certainly appreciate valuable things more!
                    Yeah my initial reaction was that it was really materialistic but I think you can probably strike a balance where it's more realistic. A cyclist would be over the moon if you bought them a high end bike for example, but they're not necessarily going to like it as much if it was second hand. The quality of something is definitely a factor.
            >iridium bar

>rare and valuable

Choose one. Thing is, different items require different amounts of effort depending on where you are in the game. If I want to produce a strawberry, i still have to think one year ahead (or sacrifice indoor space), while I could give people iridium by the bucket. In the first few years, that wouldn't have been the case, of course.
                If you don't get the statue of perfection it's rare.

Then it flips with the statue and you're drowning in it.
                Yeah, that's unfortunately true. For the first year, iridium is almost impossibly rare. Year 2, it's not too bad, but still definitely rarer than the others. Year 3 and onward, you'll have more than you ever need.

Still, I'm not too bothered by that. It makes sense that once you're crazy rich, you can get friendship very fast. Not too different from how later on, you can get gold star produce more often and purple star forage items easily (and since things like bars don't have stars, those can be worth far more!).

And personally, I keep a bunch of produce and forage already (for gifts, quests, cooking, and crafting), so the rarity from planning thing is not particularly changing the effort it takes. I know many others do this, too.
My Friday night of handing out prismatic shards from this week's skull cave plunder made me realise, prismatic shard is not a universal love.
    haley’s the only one who doesn’t like it. but she’s easy
My whole town is addicted to coffee.
I actually just gift everyone diamonds
    Beer is cheeper!
Wow first time I’ve realized the most emo person in stardew ~~likes~~**loves** *frozen tears* I feel really dumb now...
    all foraged minerals (including frozen tears) are universal likes (w/ exceptions ofc) anyways
        Sorry, I should’ve said “loves”, everyone likes it but OF COURSE the emo kid loves em
            Also fun fact about Sebastian, during the valley fair you can see him smoking *something* with Sam.
                also you may catch robin with the dialogue "I was washing Sebastian's ashtray today and it smelled weird. should I be worried?" my mans 420 friendly alright
                I can't remember if it's summer or fall, but I also saw Sebastian occasionally hanging at the train station to smoke.
                    I actually just found it in game today
                I think I remember, way back when, the blue "vase" in his room was clearly a bong... so if you ever wondered why your husband stands in front of a vase for like 5 hours a day, there you go!
            I didn't mean to nitpick btw, I genuinely thought it was just a universal like and forgot he had it as a love. my bad!
                Oh no worries :) it’s a fun little Easter egg we all realized was right in front of us!
He also loves pumpkin soup ..... he’s got layers!
    It’s because robin gives you the recipe for pumpkin soup, he likes his moms cooking!
        My fucking head just exploded
        Awww that’s actually really sweet<3 I didn’t know that
        I never realized that was why. That’s the cutest thing I’ve ever heard
            If you marry him he leaves the farmhouse to visit Robin once a week. If you catch him there he'll say "Mom deserves to be happy"
                Similar thing when you marry Haley. She occasionally goes to visit Emily and Emily remarks how how they strangely became closer after Haley moved out.
Me too. I also guessed he'd be into void eggs.
    Is he?
        Yep
Sashimi i still don’t understand though. Guess he just likes sashimi
I just grew my own flower and gave it to someone for them to be disgusted with it. Feels bad man.
    I have ongoing beef with Elliot because he was repulsed by vegetables I grew myself for him. I refuse to attend his book reading until he apologises
        He’s a man of expensive tastes! He even likes fruits and flowers as long as they weren’t foraged. No roadside berries for my man!
            He can get the shells I find on the beach and be happy with them!! 

Shane literally accepts cola I find in the trash and Elliot is rejecting my home grown produce. Upsetting.
                [deleted]
                    Like my real life husband, I just wish he’d clean his room.
                        There's a mod for that.
                            Omg really!  Too bad I already divorced him over it.
                    I gave shane like 10 things he likes and he still asks me why im talking to him screw shane lol
                        He warms up after you get a few hearts, and his events are great.
            I totally didn’t realize it but you are so right. Pomegranates, duck feathers, and crab cakes?? The man has a store and it sure isn’t Walmart.

I showed my brother Elliott’s picture when I married him and my brother said, “Why did you marry Fabio?” Served me right, Elliot never helped on the farm.
                Oh God I'm not the only one who calls him Fabio?
                    It’s truly the perfect nickname for him :)
            Huh. And I thought he got along with Leah, who likes foraged stuff.
            Gnome doesn’t understand, AMA
        Oh my god. I just read this and realized that I forgot to go to it! I was playing last night and was pretty tired so I just finished the day I was on and went to bed! Do I have another chance or will he hate me forever? I’m trying to date every bachelor/ette, except for one of each, so I can avoid the group ten heart event. That’ll work...right?
            You can go to his book reading any afternoon! 

If you want to avoid the 10 heart event you could date everyone but also carry a rabbits foot.
                [deleted]
                    In the alternative events the NPCs don't get angry with you though so there's no negative effect
        That’s weird because I used to give Elliot vegetables all the time and he liked them.
    Bruh this made me crack up. I feel you
    When I played today, Jodi invited me to dinner, asking me to bring a largemouth bass. It took a while, but I fished up a gold star bass. Went home, did all my chores, and remembered at 7:10 that dinner was at 7. 

Reset the day, do the same stuff, get to Jodi's house at 5:30. I give her my only bass. For dinner. My only bass that she asked me to bring. 

"Hmm, well I guess I could always put this in the compost..."


...bitch.
        You need to trigger the event lmao. You didn't even need to restart the day you could have just gone inside the event would have triggered. You'll get em next time champ.
            Also, when you get an invitation to be at a place at a certain time, they sometimes say "tonight" but you can trigger the event any day you like by going to the location at the specified time. Doesn't need to be exact either, I've been like an hour late and the event still triggers.
        It doesn't help that the tag line.
    Was walking to the mine and saw a daffodil and that would be worth a few extra foraging points. What do you know an NPC was walking by so I thought what the hell have I got to loose. Turns out they really liked it.
    Let me quess, Poppy?
Bruh. Shane gave me the Strange Bun recipe and asks if he can try it if you make one, but when I gave it to him his response was "Why are you giving me your trash?"

Ultimate Betrayal.
    Uff.. he set you up
    This made me so mad! I was so excited to give it to him, I had just gotten to the point where he starts being nice. It really hurt.
    He's done this to me with stuff I KNOW he likes. It stops once you get past 6(?) hearts with him.
        He was my husband in my first save so I have a soft spot for him and try to take care of him even when I marry different people in other saves, but my GOD I forgot how mean he is in the beginning.
I assumed the dwarf would like dwarf artifacts! Why does the dwarf hate his own culture and past?!
    I mean, I wouldn't like getting swamped with two human artifacts every week...
    He do like scrolls tho....
Gave the old man like a quartz for his birthday. I had a lot, I was trying to whoo Sebby, and he fucking hated it. Lost all 3 hearts with him that took me a year in game to get naturally.
    Just give that old man leeks. He fucking loves leeks. I’m level ten in foraging so I just keep giving him iridium quality leeks and he basically treats me like his granddaughter.
    George is so easy to win over though once you realise of all >!foraged edibles!< he only dislike/hates, like, 3 of them.
My first week playing I would hold random items and I would talk to villagers to get my friendship up, but I’d always give me stuff away and it was ALWAYS CLAY and I kept forgetting to put it away before I talk to them.
Also the TBoI and Enter the Gungeon wikis
    Don't forget uesp!
        And the Terraria Wiki. I can’t imagine beating the game without it. Now if you want a game where you lean on the wiki HARD then try Terraria with the Calamity mod.
I got lucky cause the first person I tried that with was Abigail and Amethyst (the hair, ya feel?) and then it never happened again....
    There’s always Haley and daffodils. Nice when you’re just starting out and have no kitchen or gems.
        And George with leeks. And Linus with just about everything.
            I just assumed "Linus wants food, right? I'll give him anything I have that he can eat."
                Except carp. He gets downright offended over carp.
                    The very first gift I gave was after a Linus quest. He asked for algae and I thought, maybe he'll want another one. Nope, that second algae was total garbage.
                        I’ve done the same thing! These fake people are strange lol
                    I gave him a field snack and he hated it.
                You can’t give him field snacks or snails. Wiki said something about fish and in parentheses it said except Linus and snails. I can’t see worth’s shit sometimes so I assumed it meant he loved snails. The man almost cried. He said “you think because I live in a tent I deserve to eat trash?” I felt so bad!  He also hates gold. I keep picturing Ted Kaczynski. He’s a hermit not really a hobo. He’s a good friend to have
                    I would've married Linus if I could lol. He's one philosophical man lol he's so nice too. I hate how he feels that everyone dislikes him :( issa okay i'll keep giving some food. most appreciative man ever
        Good girl Haley wanting sunflowers in Summer/Fall and daffodils in spring.
        i gave Haley a potato on her birthday because i couldn’t find any flowers and she was so upset.
            LMFAO. Imagine this happening in real life. You're just minding your own business walking about enjoying life and your birthday. Surprise potato! 

How would you react?
                Was on a competitive dance team in college.

My last competition ever we were gifted a potato by a different team that had 'potato' in their team name. We carried around the potato all weekend and brought it back to our campus 200+ miles away.
                My dogs are named Potato and Baby Yams. I would be ecstatic!

    [deleted]
        Was brand new to the game and hadn't spend much time on here or found the wiki yet. Got amethyst on my first trip into the mines and was like huh, Abigail has purple hair (my character is also purple) let's see what happens. She loved it, been a true love story ever since.
I can’t stop laughing thinking about you thinking a guy living in the woods wants some literal trash.
    I KNOW OKAY. Definitely did not think that through! My partner who also plays mocked me relentlessly for it. Me and linus are best friends in my new game to atone for my sins.
        He forgives you, it's okay!!

Me, my feelings were hurt because I worked hard for that. Also, I think it was a fish. Linus? Do you not wanna eat?
            He may forgive but I will never forget.
        Linus and George are always the first people I friend. The single folk can wait; I need me some >!wild bait!< and >!spicy eel!<! The latter is more or less the only thing I eat late game. My breath is probably amazing.
Unrelated, but does anyone else feel kind of bad taking forageables from the mountains? Especially during berry season when I rob the mountain of all its natural resources, I can’t help thinking about poor Linus digging through trash for food :(
    I never even thought about it. I guess I assumed hes okay because I give him gifts as often as I can.
        I answered a Help Wanted for Linus once, he wanted a diamond and paid me two grand for it - I think he's doing just fine.
            LOL. Will I ever come to understand that man? :’)
We have facebook and google doing that now basically.
    “Schedule: 7-8 AM in room on phone”
Mine will be cocaine, pizza, and tickets to Wimbledon
    One of these things is clearly not like the others.
        Well ripping fat lines while watching a jolly old tennis match clearly go together so I guess you mean the pizza?
            Actually yes.
Or, “We’ve been married for 4 years.”
I have started saying out loud "Maybe because I've given you a dozen sashimi so far?!?" I'm glad someone else feels this way haha.
    My outloud comment is, "I read it on the wiki." Say it all the time.
This is an upgrade I am waiting for fervently. It'll remake the game for me entirely. Not that I don't keep discovering new things STILL after multiple save files with multiple years... but tbh I end up getting bored with my husband/wife after a while and I feel bad about it :(.
I've been giving him sashimi for breakfast ever since I married him and his genuine surprise cracks me up every single time.
I know right? I gave her quartz once,  and she gave me that "how'd you know I was hungry? " and I'm like "Bitch, whaaa??" I guess she love munching on rocks. Amethyst is her favorite tho. Love that tasty purple crystal
    Quartz is honestly one of the best generic gifts to give to people. It’s in like, half the town’s likes and neutral for the rest.
        [deleted]
            Oh. Did not know that. I guess I just get lucky with whoever I give it to.
                Im guessing you stumble upon Marnie a lot? Whenever I need to do the shorts quest I stock up on quartz to give her cause its a cheap easy find that I already stock up on.
    This is actually lampshaded in-game: if you talk to Abigail when you're married, she'll sometimes say, "going to the mines? If you find anything tasty, dont forget to break me off a piece!" or something similar. 

Also a secret note reveals that she actually loves amethyst because she likes to sleep with them under her pillow. Probably some crystal healing thing.
Finally, I can stop having to plan what I'm going to every day and just check my Wiki instead!
    fun fact of the day?
Through sweat and frozen tears...
    Best reply ever 😂
I've done this with several different items. Once made Clint depressed by accidentally gifting him copper ore...
    I had this happen when I tried to give Willie a squid for his quest. He asked for a squid and i didn't know there were two kinds. Gave him the exotic one which I only had one of and he's all urgh, what is this?! I was confused until I went to read the wiki...
        Exact same thing happened to me for the squid quest! So frustrating, especially in early game 🙃
    To be fair, Clint is already depressed...
I mean, there is a way of finding out eventually, but I don't think its triggered until your first winter.
    What way?
        You know, it's really strange, but I can't remember now. I think it might have had something to do with the latest update. Sorry!
Just hoard one or three of everything and you'll be fine!
I agree with you. I try to limit myself on Wiki info (though I do use it for gifts), because I like uncovering the little gems throughout the game.
You're stronger than I am. If it's any consolation, there should come a point where you start finding "hints" (I won't say anything more)
This made me giggle
I'm still angry about the Bradygames guide for FFIX.
Nope! Purely coincidence.
    well, i still thought of it first
I'm sorry she has moved on 😔
I married Sebastian but only after my husband married Penny, we're even. Start the game and find yourself a wife NOW lol

If someone gifted me a diamond I'd be ecstatic.
                Eh, I wouldn't, but I'm quite financially secure. I can buy things I want.

Shopping sucks, I don't necessarily know what I like, so when someone gives me a gift I know that 1 I now don't need to buy it and 2 it could be something cool I'd never considered before like an author if it was a book.

My aunt buys me like, linen every year. I love it.
                    Cool story
                        I didn't say rich, I said doing okay. My parents heading into retirement. I earn more than they do as a result and they aren't gonna be buying me a new motorbike. 

I would hope most people my age or older are at least heading in the position I'm in. You start to value time a bit more over money. Hence why things that take a lot of labour can be really nice. My house mate makes me a birthday cake every year and it's so touching. Five year old though doesn't care for the cake wants the presents because a five year old has lots of time and no money.
            Real life. I want gifts I enjoy. If someone was to offer me then best melon I'd ever have or my dream house as a gift, I'd pick the dream house. Thats not to say I wouldn't enjoy the melon, but a house is wayyyyy more valuable. Humans are gold diggers, mostly.
                Yeah that's extremes though.

Maybe make some more universal likes? If item is > 1000 it's a universal like/love.

Something 100g than another though I think gets really materialistic though.
            I actually don't want it to naively go by buy or sell value. But that would be a good starting point for the "default" value.

But I mean, if stars influence how much someone loves something, then surely more valuable stuff should be liked, too? Because as it stands, any item that can't get a star is at a disadvantage. Leah loves wine, but she doesn't appreciate the difference in value between starfruit and salmonberry wine.

As an aside, I don't think appreciating value makes you a gold digger. If you *had* to give expensive items, that would make them a gold digger. But real people certainly appreciate valuable things more!
                Yeah my initial reaction was that it was really materialistic but I think you can probably strike a balance where it's more realistic. A cyclist would be over the moon if you bought them a high end bike for example, but they're not necessarily going to like it as much if it was second hand. The quality of something is definitely a factor.
        >iridium bar

>rare and valuable

Choose one. Thing is, different items require different amounts of effort depending on where you are in the game. If I want to produce a strawberry, i still have to think one year ahead (or sacrifice indoor space), while I could give people iridium by the bucket. In the first few years, that wouldn't have been the case, of course.
            If you don't get the statue of perfection it's rare.

Then it flips with the statue and you're drowning in it.
            Yeah, that's unfortunately true. For the first year, iridium is almost impossibly rare. Year 2, it's not too bad, but still definitely rarer than the others. Year 3 and onward, you'll have more than you ever need.

Still, I'm not too bothered by that. It makes sense that once you're crazy rich, you can get friendship very fast. Not too different from how later on, you can get gold star produce more often and purple star forage items easily (and since things like bars don't have stars, those can be worth far more!).

And personally, I keep a bunch of produce and forage already (for gifts, quests, cooking, and crafting), so the rarity from planning thing is not particularly changing the effort it takes. I know many others do this, too.
haley’s the only one who doesn’t like it. but she’s easy
Beer is cheeper!
all foraged minerals (including frozen tears) are universal likes (w/ exceptions ofc) anyways
    Sorry, I should’ve said “loves”, everyone likes it but OF COURSE the emo kid loves em
        Also fun fact about Sebastian, during the valley fair you can see him smoking *something* with Sam.
            also you may catch robin with the dialogue "I was washing Sebastian's ashtray today and it smelled weird. should I be worried?" my mans 420 friendly alright
            I can't remember if it's summer or fall, but I also saw Sebastian occasionally hanging at the train station to smoke.
                I actually just found it in game today
            I think I remember, way back when, the blue "vase" in his room was clearly a bong... so if you ever wondered why your husband stands in front of a vase for like 5 hours a day, there you go!
        I didn't mean to nitpick btw, I genuinely thought it was just a universal like and forgot he had it as a love. my bad!
            Oh no worries :) it’s a fun little Easter egg we all realized was right in front of us!
It’s because robin gives you the recipe for pumpkin soup, he likes his moms cooking!
    My fucking head just exploded
    Awww that’s actually really sweet<3 I didn’t know that
    I never realized that was why. That’s the cutest thing I’ve ever heard
        If you marry him he leaves the farmhouse to visit Robin once a week. If you catch him there he'll say "Mom deserves to be happy"
            Similar thing when you marry Haley. She occasionally goes to visit Emily and Emily remarks how how they strangely became closer after Haley moved out.
Is he?
    Yep
I have ongoing beef with Elliot because he was repulsed by vegetables I grew myself for him. I refuse to attend his book reading until he apologises
    He’s a man of expensive tastes! He even likes fruits and flowers as long as they weren’t foraged. No roadside berries for my man!
        He can get the shells I find on the beach and be happy with them!! 

Shane literally accepts cola I find in the trash and Elliot is rejecting my home grown produce. Upsetting.
            [deleted]
                Like my real life husband, I just wish he’d clean his room.
                    There's a mod for that.
                        Omg really!  Too bad I already divorced him over it.
                I gave shane like 10 things he likes and he still asks me why im talking to him screw shane lol
                    He warms up after you get a few hearts, and his events are great.
        I totally didn’t realize it but you are so right. Pomegranates, duck feathers, and crab cakes?? The man has a store and it sure isn’t Walmart.

I showed my brother Elliott’s picture when I married him and my brother said, “Why did you marry Fabio?” Served me right, Elliot never helped on the farm.
            Oh God I'm not the only one who calls him Fabio?
                It’s truly the perfect nickname for him :)
        Huh. And I thought he got along with Leah, who likes foraged stuff.
        Gnome doesn’t understand, AMA
    Oh my god. I just read this and realized that I forgot to go to it! I was playing last night and was pretty tired so I just finished the day I was on and went to bed! Do I have another chance or will he hate me forever? I’m trying to date every bachelor/ette, except for one of each, so I can avoid the group ten heart event. That’ll work...right?
        You can go to his book reading any afternoon! 

If you want to avoid the 10 heart event you could date everyone but also carry a rabbits foot.
            [deleted]
                In the alternative events the NPCs don't get angry with you though so there's no negative effect
    That’s weird because I used to give Elliot vegetables all the time and he liked them.
Bruh this made me crack up. I feel you
When I played today, Jodi invited me to dinner, asking me to bring a largemouth bass. It took a while, but I fished up a gold star bass. Went home, did all my chores, and remembered at 7:10 that dinner was at 7. 

Reset the day, do the same stuff, get to Jodi's house at 5:30. I give her my only bass. For dinner. My only bass that she asked me to bring. 

"Hmm, well I guess I could always put this in the compost..."


...bitch.
    You need to trigger the event lmao. You didn't even need to restart the day you could have just gone inside the event would have triggered. You'll get em next time champ.
        Also, when you get an invitation to be at a place at a certain time, they sometimes say "tonight" but you can trigger the event any day you like by going to the location at the specified time. Doesn't need to be exact either, I've been like an hour late and the event still triggers.
    It doesn't help that the tag line.
Was walking to the mine and saw a daffodil and that would be worth a few extra foraging points. What do you know an NPC was walking by so I thought what the hell have I got to loose. Turns out they really liked it.
Let me quess, Poppy?
Uff.. he set you up
This made me so mad! I was so excited to give it to him, I had just gotten to the point where he starts being nice. It really hurt.
He's done this to me with stuff I KNOW he likes. It stops once you get past 6(?) hearts with him.
    He was my husband in my first save so I have a soft spot for him and try to take care of him even when I marry different people in other saves, but my GOD I forgot how mean he is in the beginning.
I mean, I wouldn't like getting swamped with two human artifacts every week...
He do like scrolls tho....
Just give that old man leeks. He fucking loves leeks. I’m level ten in foraging so I just keep giving him iridium quality leeks and he basically treats me like his granddaughter.
George is so easy to win over though once you realise of all >!foraged edibles!< he only dislike/hates, like, 3 of them.
Don't forget uesp!
    And the Terraria Wiki. I can’t imagine beating the game without it. Now if you want a game where you lean on the wiki HARD then try Terraria with the Calamity mod.
There’s always Haley and daffodils. Nice when you’re just starting out and have no kitchen or gems.
    And George with leeks. And Linus with just about everything.
        I just assumed "Linus wants food, right? I'll give him anything I have that he can eat."
            Except carp. He gets downright offended over carp.
                The very first gift I gave was after a Linus quest. He asked for algae and I thought, maybe he'll want another one. Nope, that second algae was total garbage.
                    I’ve done the same thing! These fake people are strange lol
                I gave him a field snack and he hated it.
            You can’t give him field snacks or snails. Wiki said something about fish and in parentheses it said except Linus and snails. I can’t see worth’s shit sometimes so I assumed it meant he loved snails. The man almost cried. He said “you think because I live in a tent I deserve to eat trash?” I felt so bad!  He also hates gold. I keep picturing Ted Kaczynski. He’s a hermit not really a hobo. He’s a good friend to have
                I would've married Linus if I could lol. He's one philosophical man lol he's so nice too. I hate how he feels that everyone dislikes him :( issa okay i'll keep giving some food. most appreciative man ever
    Good girl Haley wanting sunflowers in Summer/Fall and daffodils in spring.
    i gave Haley a potato on her birthday because i couldn’t find any flowers and she was so upset.
        LMFAO. Imagine this happening in real life. You're just minding your own business walking about enjoying life and your birthday. Surprise potato! 

How would you react?
            Was on a competitive dance team in college.

My last competition ever we were gifted a potato by a different team that had 'potato' in their team name. We carried around the potato all weekend and brought it back to our campus 200+ miles away.
            My dogs are named Potato and Baby Yams. I would be ecstatic!

Same. Purple people live purple

    Was brand new to the game and hadn't spend much time on here or found the wiki yet. Got amethyst on my first trip into the mines and was like huh, Abigail has purple hair (my character is also purple) let's see what happens. She loved it, been a true love story ever since.
I KNOW OKAY. Definitely did not think that through! My partner who also plays mocked me relentlessly for it. Me and linus are best friends in my new game to atone for my sins.
    He forgives you, it's okay!!

Me, my feelings were hurt because I worked hard for that. Also, I think it was a fish. Linus? Do you not wanna eat?
        He may forgive but I will never forget.
    Linus and George are always the first people I friend. The single folk can wait; I need me some >!wild bait!< and >!spicy eel!<! The latter is more or less the only thing I eat late game. My breath is probably amazing.
I never even thought about it. I guess I assumed hes okay because I give him gifts as often as I can.
    I answered a Help Wanted for Linus once, he wanted a diamond and paid me two grand for it - I think he's doing just fine.
        LOL. Will I ever come to understand that man? :’)
“Schedule: 7-8 AM in room on phone”
One of these things is clearly not like the others.
    Well ripping fat lines while watching a jolly old tennis match clearly go together so I guess you mean the pizza?
        Actually yes.
My outloud comment is, "I read it on the wiki." Say it all the time.
Quartz is honestly one of the best generic gifts to give to people. It’s in like, half the town’s likes and neutral for the rest.
    [deleted]
        Oh. Did not know that. I guess I just get lucky with whoever I give it to.
            Im guessing you stumble upon Marnie a lot? Whenever I need to do the shorts quest I stock up on quartz to give her cause its a cheap easy find that I already stock up on.
This is actually lampshaded in-game: if you talk to Abigail when you're married, she'll sometimes say, "going to the mines? If you find anything tasty, dont forget to break me off a piece!" or something similar. 

Also a secret note reveals that she actually loves amethyst because she likes to sleep with them under her pillow. Probably some crystal healing thing.
fun fact of the day?
Best reply ever 😂
I had this happen when I tried to give Willie a squid for his quest. He asked for a squid and i didn't know there were two kinds. Gave him the exotic one which I only had one of and he's all urgh, what is this?! I was confused until I went to read the wiki...
    Exact same thing happened to me for the squid quest! So frustrating, especially in early game 🙃
To be fair, Clint is already depressed...
What way?
    You know, it's really strange, but I can't remember now. I think it might have had something to do with the latest update. Sorry!
well, i still thought of it first
I did not realize this. Game changed.
    Ehh press X to doubt. Don't think that's confirmed?

Edit: It's true peeps!
        [deleted]
            I trust the wiki but haven't read that anywhere and I feel like I've read the dang thing page to page lol. Linky?
                https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Friendship
                    Ahh how have I never seen that table! I keep giving them regular quality and shipping the higher quality because I thought it didn't matter.

Thanks for linking that.
                        It did change to that but it was quite a long time ago. Originally star items didnt make a difference. So depending how long youve been playing, you were correct ar some point!
                        Glad to help
        George loves leeks, so when spring rolls around I grab a bunch and toss them in a chest for when I need them.
    for real
There’s a multiplier for higher quality item gifts? Son of a bitch how long has this been a thing
It's rather imbalanced that a relatively affordable strawberry gets the exact same amount of friendship as a rare and valuable iridium bar.

In fact, they get more because stars are what matters.

I'd love a rebalance that makes item value  be taken into account. Probably with some kinda "gift value" to override items that are rare, yet weirdly low sell value (1g for a dwarf scroll?).
    So you want the NPCs to be gold diggers? It simulates real life, people want gifts they enjoy.
        I love bacon cheeseburgers. 

Not a big fan of diamonds, not much I could really do with a diamond other than sell it for face value.

If someone gifted me a bacon cheeseburger I'd be happy.

Edit: It's true peeps!

                Ahh how have I never seen that table! I keep giving them regular quality and shipping the higher quality because I thought it didn't matter.

Thanks for linking that.
                    It did change to that but it was quite a long time ago. Originally star items didnt make a difference. So depending how long youve been playing, you were correct ar some point!
                    Glad to help
    George loves leeks, so when spring rolls around I grab a bunch and toss them in a chest for when I need them.
for real
So you want the NPCs to be gold diggers? It simulates real life, people want gifts they enjoy.
    I love bacon cheeseburgers. 

Not a big fan of diamonds, not much I could really do with a diamond other than sell it for face value.

If someone gifted me a bacon cheeseburger I'd be happy.

If someone gifted me a diamond I'd be ecstatic.
        Eh, I wouldn't, but I'm quite financially secure. I can buy things I want.

Shopping sucks, I don't necessarily know what I like, so when someone gives me a gift I know that 1 I now don't need to buy it and 2 it could be something cool I'd never considered before like an author if it was a book.

My aunt buys me like, linen every year. I love it.
            Cool story
                I didn't say rich, I said doing okay. My parents heading into retirement. I earn more than they do as a result and they aren't gonna be buying me a new motorbike. 

I would hope most people my age or older are at least heading in the position I'm in. You start to value time a bit more over money. Hence why things that take a lot of labour can be really nice. My house mate makes me a birthday cake every year and it's so touching. Five year old though doesn't care for the cake wants the presents because a five year old has lots of time and no money.
    Real life. I want gifts I enjoy. If someone was to offer me then best melon I'd ever have or my dream house as a gift, I'd pick the dream house. Thats not to say I wouldn't enjoy the melon, but a house is wayyyyy more valuable. Humans are gold diggers, mostly.
        Yeah that's extremes though.

Maybe make some more universal likes? If item is > 1000 it's a universal like/love.

Something 100g than another though I think gets really materialistic though.
    I actually don't want it to naively go by buy or sell value. But that would be a good starting point for the "default" value.

But I mean, if stars influence how much someone loves something, then surely more valuable stuff should be liked, too? Because as it stands, any item that can't get a star is at a disadvantage. Leah loves wine, but she doesn't appreciate the difference in value between starfruit and salmonberry wine.

As an aside, I don't think appreciating value makes you a gold digger. If you *had* to give expensive items, that would make them a gold digger. But real people certainly appreciate valuable things more!
        Yeah my initial reaction was that it was really materialistic but I think you can probably strike a balance where it's more realistic. A cyclist would be over the moon if you bought them a high end bike for example, but they're not necessarily going to like it as much if it was second hand. The quality of something is definitely a factor.
>iridium bar

>rare and valuable

Choose one. Thing is, different items require different amounts of effort depending on where you are in the game. If I want to produce a strawberry, i still have to think one year ahead (or sacrifice indoor space), while I could give people iridium by the bucket. In the first few years, that wouldn't have been the case, of course.
    If you don't get the statue of perfection it's rare.

Then it flips with the statue and you're drowning in it.
    Yeah, that's unfortunately true. For the first year, iridium is almost impossibly rare. Year 2, it's not too bad, but still definitely rarer than the others. Year 3 and onward, you'll have more than you ever need.

Still, I'm not too bothered by that. It makes sense that once you're crazy rich, you can get friendship very fast. Not too different from how later on, you can get gold star produce more often and purple star forage items easily (and since things like bars don't have stars, those can be worth far more!).

And personally, I keep a bunch of produce and forage already (for gifts, quests, cooking, and crafting), so the rarity from planning thing is not particularly changing the effort it takes. I know many others do this, too.
Also fun fact about Sebastian, during the valley fair you can see him smoking *something* with Sam.
    also you may catch robin with the dialogue "I was washing Sebastian's ashtray today and it smelled weird. should I be worried?" my mans 420 friendly alright
    I can't remember if it's summer or fall, but I also saw Sebastian occasionally hanging at the train station to smoke.
        I actually just found it in game today
    I think I remember, way back when, the blue "vase" in his room was clearly a bong... so if you ever wondered why your husband stands in front of a vase for like 5 hours a day, there you go!
I didn't mean to nitpick btw, I genuinely thought it was just a universal like and forgot he had it as a love. my bad!
    Oh no worries :) it’s a fun little Easter egg we all realized was right in front of us!
If you marry him he leaves the farmhouse to visit Robin once a week. If you catch him there he'll say "Mom deserves to be happy"
    Similar thing when you marry Haley. She occasionally goes to visit Emily and Emily remarks how how they strangely became closer after Haley moved out.
He can get the shells I find on the beach and be happy with them!! 

Shane literally accepts cola I find in the trash and Elliot is rejecting my home grown produce. Upsetting.
    [deleted]
        Like my real life husband, I just wish he’d clean his room.
            There's a mod for that.
                Omg really!  Too bad I already divorced him over it.
        I gave shane like 10 things he likes and he still asks me why im talking to him screw shane lol
            He warms up after you get a few hearts, and his events are great.
I totally didn’t realize it but you are so right. Pomegranates, duck feathers, and crab cakes?? The man has a store and it sure isn’t Walmart.

I showed my brother Elliott’s picture when I married him and my brother said, “Why did you marry Fabio?” Served me right, Elliot never helped on the farm.
    Oh God I'm not the only one who calls him Fabio?
        It’s truly the perfect nickname for him :)
Huh. And I thought he got along with Leah, who likes foraged stuff.
Gnome doesn’t understand, AMA
You can go to his book reading any afternoon! 

If you want to avoid the 10 heart event you could date everyone but also carry a rabbits foot.
    [deleted]
        In the alternative events the NPCs don't get angry with you though so there's no negative effect
Also, when you get an invitation to be at a place at a certain time, they sometimes say "tonight" but you can trigger the event any day you like by going to the location at the specified time. Doesn't need to be exact either, I've been like an hour late and the event still triggers.
I just assumed "Linus wants food, right? I'll give him anything I have that he can eat."
    Except carp. He gets downright offended over carp.
        The very first gift I gave was after a Linus quest. He asked for algae and I thought, maybe he'll want another one. Nope, that second algae was total garbage.
            I’ve done the same thing! These fake people are strange lol
        I gave him a field snack and he hated it.
    You can’t give him field snacks or snails. Wiki said something about fish and in parentheses it said except Linus and snails. I can’t see worth’s shit sometimes so I assumed it meant he loved snails. The man almost cried. He said “you think because I live in a tent I deserve to eat trash?” I felt so bad!  He also hates gold. I keep picturing Ted Kaczynski. He’s a hermit not really a hobo. He’s a good friend to have
        I would've married Linus if I could lol. He's one philosophical man lol he's so nice too. I hate how he feels that everyone dislikes him :( issa okay i'll keep giving some food. most appreciative man ever
LMFAO. Imagine this happening in real life. You're just minding your own business walking about enjoying life and your birthday. Surprise potato! 

How would you react?
    Was on a competitive dance team in college.

My last competition ever we were gifted a potato by a different team that had 'potato' in their team name. We carried around the potato all weekend and brought it back to our campus 200+ miles away.
    My dogs are named Potato and Baby Yams. I would be ecstatic!

        When reality turns out weirder than fantasy
He may forgive but I will never forget.
LOL. Will I ever come to understand that man? :’)
Actually yes.
Oh. Did not know that. I guess I just get lucky with whoever I give it to.
    Im guessing you stumble upon Marnie a lot? Whenever I need to do the shorts quest I stock up on quartz to give her cause its a cheap easy find that I already stock up on.
