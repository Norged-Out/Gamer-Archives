[[do people still play bo2 zombies]]


cant find my old 360 disc so i'm willing to spend £40 but if the games dead i'm not sure if it's worth it.
last time i played about 2 years ago it wasn't too hard to find lobbies but could be a different story to now & i don't enjoy soloing zombies


i had just got on my 360 the other day and wanted to see the same stuff. When i opened up bo2 and went into zombies it said there was about 600 people online for zombies and mostly on town survival or bus stop transit so i would say you’d have decent luck getting into a server but it probably depends on the day and time as well
Why would you spend £40? Get it from CEX.
Can you still find a match? Yes. 

Will the match be a quality match? Probably not

I've been playing BO2 a lot recently and every single game either has really high pings or all the other players leave before round 15. Finding matches is also usually limited to tranzit, town and origins. You might get lucky and get one on the other maps.
