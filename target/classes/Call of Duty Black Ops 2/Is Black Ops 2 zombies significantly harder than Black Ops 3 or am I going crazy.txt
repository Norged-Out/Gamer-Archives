[[Is Black Ops 2 zombies significantly harder than Black Ops 3 or am I going crazy]]


Within the last 3 months Iâ€™ve gotten back into BO3 Zombies and now with this sale I also bought BO2 and itâ€™s season pass, and I am getting my ass kicked every game I havenâ€™t made it past round 5 in my 10 or so games when I can pretty easily make it to 20 in BO3 so am I getting worse, is the game really tough, or am I going crazy?


Black ops 3 zombies is pretty easy in comparison to the previous installments. Most of the guns are usable, gobblegums are overpowered as hell, you die in 3 hits instead of two, and Windowâ€™s Wine. Going back to a two hit down and a box with a lot of not so great guns in it is definitely going to kick your ass at first
    I feel like the box weapons in BO2 get more flak than they deserve; aside from the SMR and War Machine, there's nothing really BAD in there. Now, BO3 putting wall weapons in the box again, THAT I have some things to say about...
        While those are the only two really bad guns there are a few less than average guns like the Barrett, S12, Chicom, Mtar, kap40, m1216, and the DSR. Yeah these guns arenâ€™t unusable but after like round 10 they start to fall off. Thereâ€™s also EMPs which are pretty bad outside grief mode.
            Well, sure, but BO3 also has the Sheiva, RK5, KRM, VMP and Vesper; mediocre weapons, but ones I could get off the wall if need be... I'd rather have a Spectre than a PM63 if I'm rolling the box, you know?

Also, don't dump on the MTAR, it's still the best AR on Green Run and Nuketown
                BO2 has more box variety

BO3's box is more boring since every gun is strong
                    Right! Call me stupid but I love having bad guns in the box. That's the point of a risk/reward system such as the box. Added a lot of variety.
                Yeah I always felt like there were proportionally more bad guns in BO2 than BO3 but I havenâ€™t played 2 in a while. As for the MTAR I didnâ€™t like the sight and it kinda looked and sounded weird. Dumb reasons but if Iâ€™m gonna hold a gun for an hour or two I donâ€™t want one that annoys me lol.
                    I can understand that... Yeah, most of BO2's "bad guns" are restricted to Green Run. Later maps added gap-fills - like the Tommy Gun, AK-47, Uzi and Death Machine on Mob - that really helped; heck, even Nuketown had the M27 and LSAT.
        The guns in BO2 arenâ€™t bad, itâ€™s just that there are a lot of better guns in BO3. BO2 definitely has great weapons, but the abundance of good weapons in BO3 paired with double pack making every weapon viable past round 20 makes the game a lot easier.
            On the one hand, I agree with you, but on the other, I feel that when Black Ops 2 nailed a powerful weapon - like the SCAR-H and KSG on Origins, or the Uzi on Mob - it really nailed it, making those guns feel special. BO3, a decent chunk of weapons are viable, but they don't necessarily feel like there's an appreciable difference; I'm pretty indifferent as to whether I get the Man-O-War, HVK or ICR, since they'll all work more or less in the same situations.

I might be full of it here, but that's just kind of the vibe I get from the guns... I'm not sure if it makes sense or not.
                I hated the futuristic guns in BO3
    I find bo3 harder for some reason, but I've played bo2 for much longer
        Why are you getting downvoted? I feel the same way
            Because most people use the downvote as a disagree button
                I mean it doesn't matter if it was originally intended for a different purpose, that's just what it is at this point whether you like it or not.
        So do I. I feel like the zombies in Bo3 get faster and while it does take 3 hits to down you, they hit quicker and don't build up as much. I don't use gobblegums btw. For example, zombies take a second before landing a hit in Der Reise Bo1, but in The Giant? Instant hits.
    I would say that sliding also makes it incredibly easy to dodge if you get good at it.

I always find myself thinking I can slide out of a pickle in bo2 but I just get walled in.
Yes it's much harder. As well as what the other comment said, the zombies in BO2 are a lot buggier and the map design can be quite a bit harder too.
Extra hit. Gobblegums. AATs that let any gun kill at any round. More forgiving mid round bosses. Bo3 is so much easier than bo2.
Yeah itâ€™s much harder, other than one thing. I find bo3 origins way harder than bo2 origins. Iâ€™m going down on round 15 bo3 origins but I can easily get to the late 20s on bo2
    Maybe it's just my feeling but I feel like the mud in bo3 origins is slowing you much more, or the zombies are more feisty in bo3. If I happen to find myself jumping in the mud near zombies in bo3, I'm pretty much fucked up if I don't have stamin-up. In bo2 I had no trouble jumping through the hordes in the mud.
        I like training in the mud in BO2. Now I have to camp to enjoy Origins. I know some people do this, but it's heck of a lot less interesting just standing there for hours.
    Probably the changes to the mud, the increased health on the panzer, and the hyperaggressive zombie AI in BO3 making it harder
        The mud is actually the same between BO2 + BO3. Itâ€™s just BO3 movement FEELS a lot slower without slide b-hopping which you canâ€™t do in the mud
            I played BO2 and BO3 Origins back-to-back to compare the mud, and it felt significantly worse in BO3.  I think it was due to how badly jump stamina decays in BO3.  In BO2, repeated mud hops still get decent height, but in BO3 it feels like you're jumping only a few inches off the ground.
                Yes that effects it too but what Iâ€™m saying is the slowing multiplier is exactly the same
        Good thing they did that though, otherwise it'd be so easy with the Bo3 engine that it wouldn't be worth playing.
            BO2 and BO3 run on the same engine
    nawwww
    Interesting I donâ€™t have that experience at all. The BO3 one feels much easier as the panzer is less grabby, three hits to down before jugg and gobblegums so you can have the map open and all perks on round 1.
Bo3 is ez
Black Ops 3 made it easy mode
In many ways, yes. BO3 has infinite damage double PAP abilities and OP mega Gobblegums that make the game easier.

I will say though that the zombie AI in Black Ops 2 is much more forgiving than BO3 since in BO3 the zombies attack crazy fucking fast and their attack range is farther, plus they have a tendency to spread out more than they do in BO2.
    you have sliding in bo3, the zombie ai doesnt attack at all while sliding making it almost the least dangerous in the series (up to that point) in my opinion.
Sure, BO2=2 hit kills, cramped corridors (Origins, Mob), no gobble gums...
    Mob was one of the easier maps. That blue tomahawk was a one hit into the 70s
        Always kills some zombies and Brutus in one hit if you fully charge it, no matter what
I think bo3 hits the sweetspot when it comes to difficulty.
    i play bo3 for highrounding, its too easy to play otherwise. bo2 or WWll (unpopular game, i know) hit that sweetspot for me.
BO2 always kinda made you need to get the shield while in BO3 you have access to gobblegums that make you more powerful (perka, max ammos, 3mins of firesale etc.) that a shield would be good if you were new to the game/map but if youâ€™ve played it enough a shields kinda useless
The older titles (WaW-BO2) are usually considered more challenging, mainly due to how unforgiving they are. A large reason why players hate BO4 and onwards is how much easier they made the game.

        Those are specific game modes that players have to specifically choose outside of the default normal mode. You could say any game is the hardest if you choose to do x y z in game to make it harder.
Eh, maps like Buried and Die Rise can be ridiculously easy with the right setup


I mean you can literally sit in jugg indefinitely with paralyzer and vulture aid if you just tap it on and off



The rest is generally much harder than BO3 because thereâ€™s no guns that can be effectively used past round 60-70 on black ops 2, the best in general being the ray gun mk2, whereas almost any gun can be used on BO3 when double packed, in addition to the fact that most BO3 maps have OP wonder weapons unlike a few in BO2
The fact that you have a dive instead of a slide, that alone takes away way more maneuverability than you'd think. Plus, the zombies in BO2 start to do a little running as early as Round 3!
    i know dude, i was playing tranZit for the first time in years and round 14 was like bo3 round 25
Iâ€™d agree in saying bo2 is harder than bo3, having the 3-4 hit health system compared to 2-3 is nice, but the kids playing older cods after playing Cold War zombies are gonna be hit hard
    its not nice, it made jug WAAAAAY less valuable, still always in your kit but its now a 33% boost instead of 50% and the amount of shit you get away with just from starting with jug is insane.
Uh yea lol you have a 3hit down with jugg lol better find parts fora shield
    What are you on about 3 hit down with jug
        I think they meant 3 hits without jugg and then the benefit of jugg on top of it. Just skipped a lot of words :)
        My bad 4 hit on bo1
        bo2 you have 3 hit down with jug
Imo Bo3,you may have an extra hit but they hit so fast it wouldn't matter but the wonder weapons and weapons themselves are what makes it easier
Is it supposed to take atleast one magazine to kill one to the chestðŸ¤”
It's kind of a mixed bag for me. 3 hits before being killed in BO3 and the weapons being much more powerful, like even wall weapons since you got the attachments and stuff can make early game rather easy, but the zombies hit on contact and fast movement compared to the "predictable" zombies of Black Ops/BO2 that need to do the slap animation before the hit registers makes BO3 zombies more agressive. I think it really is about the weapons and gobblegums. BO3 at launch used to be much harder than BO2 since zombies hits made you lose all momentum and so you get stopped and the rest arrive and instant touch you to death.
Theyâ€™re about the same imo. People bring up the extra hit for bo3, but I think thats offset by the speed that zombies hit you at. I would say the thing that makes bo3 a bit easier are gobblegums and general map design.
    the extra hit, the powerful guns, double packing, gobblegums, easier maps, slower zombies, a slide instead of a dive, and almost every map has a way to get a guaranteed wonder weapon. i LOVE black ops 3, but its so much easier it hurts.
Itâ€™s not harder necessarily, itâ€™s just the initial health thing. Being only 2 hit downs means you donâ€™t really have room to fuck up at all. You get one mistake and then if youâ€™re hit itâ€™s over.
    Youâ€™re right also in BO3 theirs much less of a warning that youâ€™re one hit just a small part of your screen is red and thatâ€™s killing me many times I donâ€™t even know Iâ€™m hurt
I think you're going crazy, bo3 is actually hard while bo2 is a bit easier.
    Haven't played origins yet huh ?
        BO3 Origins has worse mud, the Panzer has more health, and it has the hyperaggressive zombie AI of BO3.
        I have, but when I was really far my game crashed but fun map
Sale on Steam or a console?
    Piratebay. Old CoDs dont go on sale
        Get Redacted and play online with the boys!
        Lmao itâ€™s on sale on Xbox anything activision is
            Just console and blizzard net then because steam hasnt seen any action in years
                Bo3 goes on sale on steam every couple of months.
    On consoles (Xbox at least) theirs a full 50 activision sale where the game and season pass are a total 40 dollars
    On a console you can buy a cheap used copy, dlc wonâ€™t go on sale but you can get the base game pretty cheap.

On PC you can use plutonium or rektt5 pretty good for playing online with the homies
100% harder.
Black Ops 2 got that Zeilinski fuckery in half of the maps which makes it a decent bit harder along with the other things that people have said in this post
Gobblegums, better hit boxes and movement, specialist weapons, better weapons in general, easier to get points. It's a hell of a lot easier
I felt the same after getting a break from Cold War zombies and going back for Origins on BO3. Iâ€™d die in every Panzersoldat round.

Going back to Origins on BO2 makes me believe that the melee animation is different, with less reach, so I died in round 3.
    dude, cold war is so easy it hurts. i still had fun, but once i ran out of shit to upgrade there was no reason to play anymore.
Bo2 zombies has the old 2 hits go down before getting Jugg
There was a perma perk that everyone called perma jugg becaus it allowed you to take 3 hits instead of 2
Sadly it can only be done on the Tranzit crew maps

In bo3 they introduced the now common 3 hit down system
There's no more perma perks after all so that at least is why I personally think Bo3 is easier than the older games
BO3 is ridiculously easy. Bo2 isn't necessarily hard but bo1, bo2 and Waw are dark souls compared to bo3
Lmaoooo Bo2 and before is for the men. The children can play Bo3 onwards.
You're right
It's subjective.  I personally find BO3 incredibly difficult and BO2 fairly easy.  The two-hit system is needlessly unforgiving, but I still find it easier than BO3 where the rate at which zombies attack is off the charts.
    its absolutely NOT subjective. heres some reasons bo3 is objectively easier: 3 hit system (zombies attack speed is consistently higher but bo2 and back had that issue where sometimes a zombie would hit you twice or even three times at once), slides instead of dives (zombies dont attack sliding players), double PaP is insane, almost all of the guns are way better than their bo2 equivalents, specialist weapons, gobblegums, easier maps (for the most part), and map gimmicks that could give you thousands of points worth of free shit
        >bo2 and back had that issue where sometimes a zombie would hit you twice or even three times at once

For me, occasionally getting bullshitted by that bug is preferable to always getting attacked at bo3 speeds.  So, subjective.

>zombies dont attack sliding players

I would have to test this to be sure, but I'm 99.99% sure you can get hit while sliding. So this sounds like straight-up misinformation.

All the rest of your points make sense, but again, it's subjective.  Things like insane double PaP make the game easier once you're mostly/fully set up, but for me the bulk of difficulty comes from early rounds.  And in BO3, I think that early rounds are harder (without megas).  Once again, it's subjective.
Nah, the zombies are too slow, and most of the maps have Op weapons like the paralyzer or the Staffs.
100% yes. none of that "erm, in many ways" bs, its ABSOLUTELY harder, and bo3 (while one of my favorites) is the easiest if the first four in the black ops bloodline (WaW, Bo1, Bo2, Bo3, Bo4, BoCW [although only Bo3 and back are worth playing]) in almost every way.
The zombies themselves are significant more challenging in BO3 (Faster Speed, Swipes and ability to train). But using the new features make it easier.
I feel like the box weapons in BO2 get more flak than they deserve; aside from the SMR and War Machine, there's nothing really BAD in there. Now, BO3 putting wall weapons in the box again, THAT I have some things to say about...
    While those are the only two really bad guns there are a few less than average guns like the Barrett, S12, Chicom, Mtar, kap40, m1216, and the DSR. Yeah these guns arenâ€™t unusable but after like round 10 they start to fall off. Thereâ€™s also EMPs which are pretty bad outside grief mode.
        Well, sure, but BO3 also has the Sheiva, RK5, KRM, VMP and Vesper; mediocre weapons, but ones I could get off the wall if need be... I'd rather have a Spectre than a PM63 if I'm rolling the box, you know?

Also, don't dump on the MTAR, it's still the best AR on Green Run and Nuketown
            BO2 has more box variety

BO3's box is more boring since every gun is strong
                Right! Call me stupid but I love having bad guns in the box. That's the point of a risk/reward system such as the box. Added a lot of variety.

All the rest of your points make sense, but again, it's subjective.  Things like insane double PaP make the game easier once you're mostly/fully set up, but for me the bulk of difficulty comes from early rounds.  And in BO3, I think that early rounds are harder (without megas).  Once again, it's subjective.
Well, sure, but BO3 also has the Sheiva, RK5, KRM, VMP and Vesper; mediocre weapons, but ones I could get off the wall if need be... I'd rather have a Spectre than a PM63 if I'm rolling the box, you know?

Also, don't dump on the MTAR, it's still the best AR on Green Run and Nuketown
    BO2 has more box variety

BO3's box is more boring since every gun is strong
        Right! Call me stupid but I love having bad guns in the box. That's the point of a risk/reward system such as the box. Added a lot of variety.
    Yeah I always felt like there were proportionally more bad guns in BO2 than BO3 but I havenâ€™t played 2 in a while. As for the MTAR I didnâ€™t like the sight and it kinda looked and sounded weird. Dumb reasons but if Iâ€™m gonna hold a gun for an hour or two I donâ€™t want one that annoys me lol.
        I can understand that... Yeah, most of BO2's "bad guns" are restricted to Green Run. Later maps added gap-fills - like the Tommy Gun, AK-47, Uzi and Death Machine on Mob - that really helped; heck, even Nuketown had the M27 and LSAT.
On the one hand, I agree with you, but on the other, I feel that when Black Ops 2 nailed a powerful weapon - like the SCAR-H and KSG on Origins, or the Uzi on Mob - it really nailed it, making those guns feel special. BO3, a decent chunk of weapons are viable, but they don't necessarily feel like there's an appreciable difference; I'm pretty indifferent as to whether I get the Man-O-War, HVK or ICR, since they'll all work more or less in the same situations.

I might be full of it here, but that's just kind of the vibe I get from the guns... I'm not sure if it makes sense or not.
    I hated the futuristic guns in BO3
Because most people use the downvote as a disagree button
    I mean it doesn't matter if it was originally intended for a different purpose, that's just what it is at this point whether you like it or not.
I played BO2 and BO3 Origins back-to-back to compare the mud, and it felt significantly worse in BO3.  I think it was due to how badly jump stamina decays in BO3.  In BO2, repeated mud hops still get decent height, but in BO3 it feels like you're jumping only a few inches off the ground.
    Yes that effects it too but what Iâ€™m saying is the slowing multiplier is exactly the same
BO2 and BO3 run on the same engine
Just console and blizzard net then because steam hasnt seen any action in years
    Bo3 goes on sale on steam every couple of months.
