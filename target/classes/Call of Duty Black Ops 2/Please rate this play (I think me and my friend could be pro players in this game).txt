Bro please turn that atrocious shameless aimbot off, it’s unbeatable people like this that ruin this game acting like they own the place smh…
    I can't win without it
        Then fucking lose and let others enjoy the game
            Better yet stop playing
                But if he quits, 25% of the BO2 player base will disappear.
            This is the most enlightened comment I’ve ever come across. Literally people don’t know how to lose, and this is the core of rot for our games.
            But you could use aim assist to?
                I don't think it existed in online but if it does, it's probably miniscule
                    Oh I’m dumb I just realized he’s using aimbot not aim assist lol nvm yea fuck em
                    Oh it does, it definitely does. I used to have a jailbroken ps3 and an rgh xb 360, there were countless mod menus/tools with everything you could think of god mode, aimbot, literally anything and they were made for online use. The tool would force host so that you get host every time otherwise your tool/mod menu wouldn’t work. Also it is/was extremely common to get into lobbies with people cheating.
                        I was talking about built in aim assist, in the actual game settings. It existed in local for sure but im not sure about online. I know cheats exist online
            the commitment to the bit is almost making me question the seriousness of it 😭
                Same
        Worst reasoning I've ever fucking heard. "I cheat because I suck, and nobody else deserves to win because I suck ass" is what you just said. I'm not even a big cod fan, but cheaters like this ruin every competitive game. Learn to fucking play, or if that's too damn hard, learn to lose and be a good sport like everyone else on the damn planet.
        Skill issue
        You're the type of person ruining it for us casual gamers.  It's just lame.
        Looks like you can't even shoot with it. That play you barely shot near the guy
        Loser alert, how the fuck are you still ass with aim assist
        Saddest thing I've heard all day lmfao
        Or juss stop playing with ppl go play by yourself if u gotta cheat on a 7 year old game🤣🤣💯
    PC stans will never get that it’s VERY hard to aim precisely at all with a thumb stick. It’s not even aimbot either. It’s a very weak pull when a moving target crosses the sight, so you still need to aim on point to hit. It makes it a little easier to hit moving targets.
        What is he talking about aim assist?
            Target assist. It is a very weak pull in the direction an enemy is moving.
                Is it a setting or in a mod menu? I couldn’t even tell he was using anything
                    I was being sarcastic as hell
                        Oh 🥲
                            I don’t understand how so many people thought I was seriously frustrated. That makes 0 sense watching the corresponding clip from OP 😭
                                I don't even think op has aim assist on I find it funny how many people thought you was serious 🤣
                    It’s a setting that’s on by default, but it’s not a major advantage, just a small one. 

- someone who’s played PC and Console, lots of Console
                        Depends on the game
                            And the settings. Tweaking the ads sensitivities can make the target chase a little more aggressive.
        Missing jokes is a sign of autism
        Yes it is quite harder but by no means has it been that hard I own both console and PC I do prefer PC but I'm not bad with a controller it just takes practice and setting up your settings the way that works best for you. and they were joking about the aim bot.
    People like you don’t understand that controller players need that, on a mouse you don’t need to return to center at all when aiming there’s no center axis. You always need to return to center when aiming on controller which is why aim assist exists! But go ahead and keep it off and make it unnecessarily harder for yourself just to have an ego.
        Yea
        Sarcasm my dude… sarcasm
        We don’t need it in fact sometimes it actively hampers our ability to shoot someone but it mostly is a skill issue if your missing these shots
            I play shooters on pc, minus some story game fps’s for example re village. Never once did I say I missed any shots just showing a point
                Okay
    Fr there cheats are getting worse by the day
Well deserved one shot one kill badge.
    8 shots, 1 kill 😈🔥♨️
        Should change his nick to garden hoe, the way he's spraying all over the place.
            garden hoe that’s a good one
God this game was incredible and ahead of its time. We still can’t get any modern game to be as good as black ops 2 ever was. Pretty crazy.
    I almost agree with you, but this was the gameplay that made you type that..? 😹😹
        Hahaha I mean just seeing any gameplay of BO2 gives me the goosebumps. Man I just miss that game so much, it’s a real shame it’s just infested with loser cheaters (like actual ones).
            I was about to get black ops 2 out the other night but just hopped on Cold War instead and it satisfied the craving lol
                Idk though, I don’t like how Cold War feels. Don’t like the guns or anything else about it. The hit detection also feels super weird to me. I get what you mean, it does trigger some nostalgia, but still not quite the same way :(
                    If you have a computer download plutonium for a cheater free experience if u don't have bo2 on PC you can pirate it, plutonium let's you download it for free
                    Bo2 zombies was peak zombies no debate
        Absolutely… bo2 felt better to play at that moment then cod does now. Everyone has their own opinion though.
            Nah any positive opinion on COD after BO3 is invalid af even thought I did enjoy WW2
        I'm a simple man, I hear the ballista and I sob tears of joy.
    I'm happy a direct sequel is releasing next year
        i am ish. i hope they don’t fuck this one up as bad as the last few have been. cold war was alright, but they can do better
            If the rumor is true they are scrapping the new movement for this one and going back to the old Black Ops system. It should feel relatively close to BO1 and BO2 but have more up to date graphics. Plus they are bringing back classic Black Ops maps.
                Black ops 2 movement was absolutely goated. The perfect balance between the twitchyness of mw2 and the sluggish feeling of BO1
                sounds like all good things to me. we will just have to see. the gulf war setting sounds pretty neat
    Fr this was probably my favorite COD ever next to MW3
10, so good in fact I actually think you should quit this game and maybe any game for the forseeable future to give other players a chance
    Lmaoooo
Homie is unstoppable
Iron sight while quickscoping?
    Insane
    Every shot is a blackscope 😎
        Blackscope? I was gonna say no scope
Call of Duty should have never been about going pro and doing e sports bullshit and instead should have been just casual dumb fun involving shooting shit on relatively small maps while shit talking to randoms that complain about the game.
    Agree
    Every game has players who take it seriously enough to go pro, cod is no different. The cod pro scene is also a joke lmao
        True my boi speaking fax
The dive😂
    the jump at the corner.. the dive. 10/10 lol
I love iron sights on the ballista I got so good at it when I was a kid
Dude your going pro. FaZe will be calling any minute now
Have you tried shooting the enemy?
    I have no enemies
        He's a man of god
            He's a T.H.U.G.🙏
You’re the reason I got off this game, couldn’t handle it
Not the iron sights lol
Man, you’re too good for this game. 200/10. Maybe your too good so you might have to quit for not being spam reported for aim bot. Such incredible stuff, seen today. There’s nothing like it.
The shock I had when I realized you were on mouse and keyboard
Dude y’all need to stop hacking in bo2, that aim bot is ridiculous
I’m gonna buy it idc, I need it
Terrible. All around terrible
I miss my buddies
He doesn’t miss those
Maybe if there was a separate league for legally blind gamers, then you have a good chance.
Bruh I thought this shit was on controller how do you miss that many times 😭
    I downloaded the game on the same day, I suck on fps
Holu shit
Dang, time to apply for faze or optic
FaZe been real quiet since this dropped
PAIN/10
Ah the prophesied destroyer of opponents controllers.
You tried out for faze yet? They’d prolly take ya in a heartbeat
I can’t lie guys, it’s sad black ops 2 has better graphics than mw3(2023)
Yeah one day pal, I bet you’ll be seeing the insides of private mansions and all your best buddies will be on faze clan.
What did that boat ever do to you?
Lmao 😂
I fired and I missed. I fired again, I missed that shot too. I fired and I fired. I missed both times!
yall are firing before even aiming what in gods name is your mouse/controller sensitivity lmao
I know this is satire… but this is me whenever I’m challenged to a quick scoping 1v1.
I would say don’t give up on your dreams but It might be to late for that🙏
2/6.
reported, have fun with the ban aimbotter
When the weapon skins were perfect and only cost 1 or 2 dallors.
    I remember raking leaves for a week so my mom would buy me the dragon and cyborg skin
“Gamma, Scuf, Faze” ([video](https://youtu.be/Pf0UqWfQcWg?si=HrUXKs9z4r31cqyZ))
This is honestly the most fun way to play. Two brand new completely ass players 1v1 with something like a sniper. Slow fire rate. One shot kill. Perfect aim required.
I used to be silly on the sticks when I was kid. I remember kids on the mic screaming at me for hard scoping because quickscoping was the coolest thing back then
Faze doesn’t have shit on you I think you might be the best player to have ever touched bo2 :o
Somebody give this guy a mod menu
Mans up there with IGN journalists
Bro please leave some kills for us noobs!
duuuuuude. my buddy and i use to play custom matches on bo2 all the time. iron sight ballistas was one of our favs
Epic dude.
Clearly your using aim bot and HACKS!
0/100. You didn’t tea-bag after a kill. Trash. Uninstall.
I’ve definitely had moments like this lmao
What’s the point of flexing you “could be pro players” when you obviously already are 🤦‍♂️ sweats like you make me so mad
You’re so good 🤮
11/10 would die horribly
We didn't see it but all those shots hit someone on shore🥶🥶🔥💪
We didn't see it but all those shots hit someone on shore🥶🥶🔥💪
Bro just uploaded a video from prime FaZe days and think we wouldn’t notice
Lmao I’m worse
Boom headshot
10/10 you make me scared to get on
Idk man that looks like you're hacking, it's pretty obvious. Litteraly impossible to hit those kinds of shots
this is the best thing ive seen all day
Damn bro that was like a headshot
😂😇
Better than me 😅
No tbag, 2/10
why are you so good at this game
:0
Me on a 1 Bar Connection
    🥲
Bro was trying to quick scope and failing
Impressive
How’d you get this clip of my gameplay? Lol
Yeah should probably take that aimbot off, how many times did you shoot before actually hitting the target
the dolphin dive killed me 💀
How do you play on mouse and keyboard and make it look like you're playing on a controller with one hand? I WISH I was that talented dude
Probably the best play I've ever seen
Clips pretty valid to me tbh
All to hard scope at the end 😭
Summary:  
Shots 1-5: Clearly missed.  
Shots 6-9: Missed due to recoil (bad spray control).  
Shots 10-11: Very close, but recoil and inaccuracy make these reasonable misses.  
Shot 12: Likely didn't actually fire because He was already dead.
I had to slow this video down to carefully analyze it; it looked spliced. Well done, OP. Puttin the “pros” to shame with this one
Looks like me when trying to play keyboard and mouse after decades on a controller
mod menus and hacks like these are why bo2 multiplayer is dead
Cheaters ruined the game.
i just got sent back to 2014, i miss those times
Heys guys this is satire. It's a joke. He sucks on purpose. There I ruined it
Yo turn that aimbot off, smh the lack of shame these days
That was fire pookie
would be better if recorded on a camcorder pointed at a CRT TV playing BO2
I would’ve already shot you by now with two MAYBE one shot if I’m lucky with the amount of accuracy you have. 🫵🏽😆
How tf did you get my gameplay?
Too many cheaters anyway R.I.P
Good aim
![gif](giphy|7rf3KOVFBdz6HkdrnC|downsized)
Using cheats in cod is so pathetic dude....
Average controller user footage
join faze clan already
    They fell off and got sketchy
    I love how every 9 year old with a gaming console has a gamertag along the lines of FaZe_Steakfarts or some shit.
I think it’s time to put down the controller, chief.
Do people play this more then BO3? This game is old….what platform you on?
    What about it being old? I play a 16 year old game regularly.
        Me too. Half the games i play can drink beer in Germany.
            I play the shit out of some team fortress 2.
    I'm playing on Pc, never played bo3 btw
    Yeah… age means nothing.
        I just didn’t realize older cod’s still had servers and everything sorry I’m outta the loop
No you are dog shit dude
both going no where
Amazing truly incredible
Lmfao trash, plus game is dead go pro in something relevant and keep moving forward if you wanna be pro in the cod community
Lol
You are actually so terrible… This hurts
help if you line up the shot before shooting but that’s just me.
Brotha is aiming with his Johnson
If you turn your sensitivity up about 10% you would have hit about half those shots
This Play had me in shambles. Truly breathtaking and jaw dropping.

You got this king
Please tell me this post is satirical
-1000/10 you would have been better hip firing and definitely not a pro player clip
lets put it this way. i would hate to be in a lobby with y'all
Why don’t we all just play bo2 and then it won’t be a dead game
Bro your aim is ass
Your so dogshit that you have to hack to play the game that’s actually sad like I have never seen such aim that’s it’s obviously hacks
As a heavy sniper user. Especially back then. 0/10. Lose the iron sites imho. I remember people would get called out for using iron sites and ballistic cpu lol. So im saying it for a throwback. But fr iron sites is a no no imo. Also. Custom games amd add a bot or two and practice daily. I remember id 1v1 bots for an hour or two a day with quickscopes, black scopes, no scopes, trickshots, nac’s, and maybe some spawn trapping. You also need to pre aim and predict the enemies movement and shoot in that prediction. Same with wallbang and especially corner wallbangs. Know what u can shoot through. You need a lot of practice in my eyes. But also have fun doing it. I had fun doing this back then.
Bro please play any other game you were sweating your ass off
You’re trash
You missed like your first 5 shots
Ooooo so close. You're supposed to hit em
![gif](giphy|b0E3PPld4558irObaY)

            If you have a computer download plutonium for a cheater free experience if u don't have bo2 on PC you can pirate it, plutonium let's you download it for free
            Bo2 zombies was peak zombies no debate
Absolutely… bo2 felt better to play at that moment then cod does now. Everyone has their own opinion though.
    Nah any positive opinion on COD after BO3 is invalid af even thought I did enjoy WW2
I'm a simple man, I hear the ballista and I sob tears of joy.
i am ish. i hope they don’t fuck this one up as bad as the last few have been. cold war was alright, but they can do better
    If the rumor is true they are scrapping the new movement for this one and going back to the old Black Ops system. It should feel relatively close to BO1 and BO2 but have more up to date graphics. Plus they are bringing back classic Black Ops maps.
        Black ops 2 movement was absolutely goated. The perfect balance between the twitchyness of mw2 and the sluggish feeling of BO1
        sounds like all good things to me. we will just have to see. the gulf war setting sounds pretty neat
Blackscope? I was gonna say no scope
True my boi speaking fax
He's a man of god
    He's a T.H.U.G.🙏
Me too. Half the games i play can drink beer in Germany.
    I play the shit out of some team fortress 2.
I just didn’t realize older cod’s still had servers and everything sorry I’m outta the loop
Better yet stop playing
    But if he quits, 25% of the BO2 player base will disappear.
This is the most enlightened comment I’ve ever come across. Literally people don’t know how to lose, and this is the core of rot for our games.
But you could use aim assist to?
    I don't think it existed in online but if it does, it's probably miniscule
        Oh I’m dumb I just realized he’s using aimbot not aim assist lol nvm yea fuck em
        Oh it does, it definitely does. I used to have a jailbroken ps3 and an rgh xb 360, there were countless mod menus/tools with everything you could think of god mode, aimbot, literally anything and they were made for online use. The tool would force host so that you get host every time otherwise your tool/mod menu wouldn’t work. Also it is/was extremely common to get into lobbies with people cheating.
            I was talking about built in aim assist, in the actual game settings. It existed in local for sure but im not sure about online. I know cheats exist online
the commitment to the bit is almost making me question the seriousness of it 😭
    Same
Target assist. It is a very weak pull in the direction an enemy is moving.
    Is it a setting or in a mod menu? I couldn’t even tell he was using anything
        I was being sarcastic as hell
            Oh 🥲
                I don’t understand how so many people thought I was seriously frustrated. That makes 0 sense watching the corresponding clip from OP 😭
                    I don't even think op has aim assist on I find it funny how many people thought you was serious 🤣
        It’s a setting that’s on by default, but it’s not a major advantage, just a small one. 

- someone who’s played PC and Console, lots of Console
            Depends on the game
                And the settings. Tweaking the ads sensitivities can make the target chase a little more aggressive.
I play shooters on pc, minus some story game fps’s for example re village. Never once did I say I missed any shots just showing a point
    Okay
garden hoe that’s a good one
