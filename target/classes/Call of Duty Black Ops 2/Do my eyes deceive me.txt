Random was chosen when studio and nuketown were the 2 map choices.  My xbox and I both exploded
    In my opinion, Nuketown is too hectic with the great submachine guns and the LMG's.  I don't have the new map PAC though, so I can't comment on studio
        I don't care for Nuketown either, the only consistently successful strategy for that map is to camp.  
            It's hardly even camping on that map as much as just trying to hold your position.
                You can basically get spawn trapped anywhere on the map. I'm sick of it at this point.
                Yeah, but you can hide in a corner up top on either side and aim for a door, I hate that shit.
        Studio is just Firing Range with BO2 weapons. It's basically the same as Nuketown.

    I need four more friends for that
It's a travesty when Standoff doesn't get voted for. 
    I dunno, Standoff is starting to get on my nerves... It's a great map and all, but I can't get into an Arms Race lobby without it being there. Standoff and Grind are about the only maps in freaking Arms Race.
        I love Standoff for Domination and Hardcore TDM. Otherwise... Meh. I think it has done so well because its "three routes" aren't extremely distinguishable. Unlike maps like Meltdown or Grind where the three routes are very obvious, Standoff feels more open than it really is, thanks to the overlooks, the middle house, and open middle road. Plus, the open areas play well with the close quarters, and allow different strategies in many game modes. You can have snipers cut off the middle from a window, or a shotgun user can patrol the middle using the middle house and the walls as cover. Its one of those rare maps that lets anyone play their strengths.
        find another lobby
    Second best map, IMO.  Raid gets first.
        Raid and standoff are without a doubt the two best maps. I like standoff better because it's less clusterfuckish. 
            And more sniper action
                [deleted]
                    But annoying to get killed by
                        Only up close or getting oneshotted by a semi-auto sniper. 
                            I cannot tell you how many times I got QSed today after emptying half my clip into their chest
                                This is what I like most about PC. While some people still can quick scope, it is very rare. 

People who quick scope annoyed me to no end. Getting away from that was such a relief. (Not trying to start a platform war)
                                    In hindsight, I think Treyarch should have stuck with their BO1 sniping mechanics. I almost rarely win a gunfight with a quickscoper and I don't recall ever having issues this bad with them (as far as gunfights are concerned) until this COD. 

And no worries, I'm not one to get annoyed by console war talk. We all have our own reasons for what console we use.
                                Its also bull when they don't flinch at all, even without toughness its almost non-existent. 
                                    I agree, Treyarch kind of dropped the ball on sniping here
            any you know why that is?  less emphasis on the stupid 3-lane map design.  Raid and Standoff promote more of a circular flow to the action.
                They have to have inconsistent map design to keep everyone's kd as close to 1 as possible. 
            Yes..standoff is amazing when going for quad feeds and triples :)

(what is it called when you get six kills straight? quadruple?)
                >what is it called when you get six kills straight? 

Sextet. 
                    Hehehe
                        He said "tet"
                    Huehue.
Nice play on words
                quad is short for quadruple. i believe 6 rapid kills is a super kill
        Raid would be best map without the kitchen. Camper spots and spawn traps in there ruin it a little bit. That said there's the same problems with pretty much every map. 
            But then where would they keep the piles of money?
        Whaaaat - Raid is honestly my least favourite map... I don't get the hype for Raid... especially when I see it getting voted for over something like Standoff.
        [deleted]
            Couldn't disagree more.  Then again, this is coming from a guy that really liked Bog on COD4.
                Bog was and will always be one of my favorite maps of call of duty. Another would be crossroads (i think). 
                    Overgrown and Creek were two of my favorites.
                    Crossfire perhaps?
                I loved Bog because you had to be so careful moving anywhere in that map, we need more maps like this in BO2.
        TRUTH!
    Wow, apparently I'm the only one who can't stand standoff. At least in this subreddit. 
        What maps do you like? 
            Slums, nuketown, raid, hijacked, and yemen. Standoff reminds of a really shitty map from MW3, I think it's called Fallen or something. It's a sniper and camper fest. I like it for SnD and that's about it.
                Fallen was a huge pile of shit packed into one grassy urban block. I do like Standoff, though.
                    I know. They both have that depressing urban feel to me, and they both demand similar styles of play. I don't like either, though Standoff is better than Fallen. Fuck Fallen; easily the worst map in mw3, and that's saying a lot considering how shit the maps in that game were.
                        I'll have to agree with you on Fallen, although when fucking Interchange got picked I wanted to lay down and shed a tear or two.
                            Interchange was so bleh. But I'd say Resistance was a really shitty map, too. A lot of space but everyone clusters the very middle room.
                        Downturn nothing was worse then downturn  
                >Yemen

Your opinion is automatically invalid...
                    Your opinion is automatically rude. 
                    You don't like Yemen? Your opinion is automatically also invalid.
        I used to enjoy standoff a lot I still think its a very well put together map but I feel like it has some of the worst spawns ever recently. Idk maybe just me. 
        Run the 870 and stay indoors, and its a lot of fun.
Every Nuketown game is a shitstorm within the first ten seconds. Grenades flying everywhere, Snipers lying down on the other side of the map where nobody can hit them, people shooting you through walls...

I love it.
    Thank you, I never see this opinion stated, so i'm always too scared to say it haha. Nuketown is the epitome of what people hate about CoD, with the random nades, spray n' pray, and helter skelter gameplay. Yet, somehow I just find it so much damn fun.
        I was so glad when they announced Nuketown would be preorder/DLC only so I knew I wouldn't have to play it as I never preorder game. Then they went and gave it to everyone. Shit sucks.
    The other day I got killed through the house while capturing A by a guy with a lmg and fmj. All of my wat.
I had Meltdown outvote Nuketown the other day. 7-1

Never thought i'd see the day....
    Impossible.
        Swear. Bonus - I had just joined the lobby and meltdown was the defending map
My wife just walked by and saw this on my screen and said, "Holy dick! Nuketown got voted out?!" 
    wi... wife?
        Does not compute
        She actually plays on my account more than I do. She hates Nuketown. 
    Yes I am sure that happened. 
        Says the lag switcher...
            Sure thing bro...
        True story. 
Was that last night?
I saw the same thing happen when i was playing last night, I couldn't believe it.
I prefer standoff. 
I think we were in the same match this happend to me earlier today 
Standoff is awesome. I don't exactly know why I like it so much.

Maybe because of the complex sightlines, so that every position has a vulnerable point. It's like it was *designed*.
[deleted]
    Nah i was just surprised because that's the first time I've ever seen nuketown out voted 
        why didn't you vote on Nuketown?
            Because nuketown sucked dick in bo1 and it sucks dick in bo2.

Then again OP plays TDM so it is surprising he doesn't like nuketown.
            I'm working on gold ballista and I'm doing the cherry blossom and art of war camo so I have no perks or attachments on it
                You do them both at once?
                    Yea I just prestiged it the first time so I just took off the perks. Then you can work on 2 camos at once while you unlock attachments again
                        Two major camos in half the time, I do it that way as well. My brother-in-law was astounded when he found out I did it that way, apparently it never crossed his mind. 
    Your moms *face* was meant for /r/circlejerk !
        you are the reason the Call of Duty community gets such a bed rep.
            Holy shit ... calm down and learn to take a fucking joke.
                I think he would take it better if it wasn't so terrible.
                    You uptight cunts need to relax.

                            ;)

Wait...what...but...how? Why? [I DEMAND ANSWERS.](http://img.myconfinedspace.com/wp-content/uploads/tdomf/145756/are%20you%20a%20wizard.jpg)
    Because its hard to use my MK48 on nuke town. Just kidding. Rapid fire on all you mofos.
Photoshop
Standoff is picked every fucking time i play. I would be surprised if it doesn't come up once every 3 games.

Don't get me wrong, i like Standoff, but i want the newer maps to come up more in rotation when possible.
Nice. Standoff is becoming one of my favorites. Whenever nuketown is chosen I just run around wild with the B32R and 2 C4s w/scavenger, lightweight, and extreme condition and cause havoc. 
Well, Nuketwon was/is fun in BlackOps but it doesn't really work in this game. I leave the lobby when it shows up cause I hate that map in BlackOps2.
Nuketown and Studio the most voted for maps... both from black ops 1...

fuck logic.
Standoff is an awesome map
Wow people actually picked a map other than nuketown 😱😱😱

    It's a Christmas miracle.
        Checkmate, atheists.
Fuck nuketown
Looks like the 13 year olds lost that vote 
I was staring at this a good 30 seconds before it hit me. To be honest, I would also pick Standoff. Since Nuketown got into regular rotation it is too much.
So why is/was nuketown so good in blops1, and so bad in blops2?
    Weapons are overall much stronger in this game, in a map as small as nuketown it makes it x2 as hectic as it was in blops 1.
Nope. You bought the Phil Jackson book.
Hath thine eyes, for future reference. 
I love standoff!
This must be fake.
The weapons in BO2 are all too powerful for Nuketown to play well. It worked in BO1 because the guns were slightly weaker, and less accurate.
Standoff in HC CTF is the best combo IMO, I don't understand why we cant have all modes for all
Were you in Bizzaro world?
I don't get it.
    [deleted]
        Oh. So...
            so normally everyone always gets a hard on for nuketown when it pops up so its a rare sight to see it not get voted for. 
    Everyone always votes for Nuketown... Every... Damn time! 
        I wonder if Treyarch keeps track of voting.  It'd be interesting to see exactly how high Nuketown's win percentage is when it comes up
            I'm going to say 98.237%
Turbine has to be the least favorite...I hate that bullshit map
Standoff is always voted on in my lobbies. I can't stand the damn map.
nuketown is the best 
Question: I have great wifi and everything is connected properly but when I try to enter a zombie game it finds likes 30 matches but does not put me in one, it tells me to ready up and that is waiting for one more person but nothing happens it just keeps trying to find a match. Any help? 
    try making a separate thread or call treyarch support
    wat?
Op is faggot
Am I the only one here who hates Raid? I can't stand that map.
In my opinion, Nuketown is too hectic with the great submachine guns and the LMG's.  I don't have the new map PAC though, so I can't comment on studio
    I don't care for Nuketown either, the only consistently successful strategy for that map is to camp.

                            In hindsight, I think Treyarch should have stuck with their BO1 sniping mechanics. I almost rarely win a gunfight with a quickscoper and I don't recall ever having issues this bad with them (as far as gunfights are concerned) until this COD. 

And no worries, I'm not one to get annoyed by console war talk. We all have our own reasons for what console we use.
                        Its also bull when they don't flinch at all, even without toughness its almost non-existent. 
                            I agree, Treyarch kind of dropped the ball on sniping here
    any you know why that is?  less emphasis on the stupid 3-lane map design.  Raid and Standoff promote more of a circular flow to the action.
        They have to have inconsistent map design to keep everyone's kd as close to 1 as possible. 
    Yes..standoff is amazing when going for quad feeds and triples :)

(what is it called when you get six kills straight? quadruple?)
        >what is it called when you get six kills straight? 

Sextet. 
            Hehehe
                He said "tet"
            Huehue.
Nice play on words
        quad is short for quadruple. i believe 6 rapid kills is a super kill
Raid would be best map without the kitchen. Camper spots and spawn traps in there ruin it a little bit. That said there's the same problems with pretty much every map. 
    But then where would they keep the piles of money?
Whaaaat - Raid is honestly my least favourite map... I don't get the hype for Raid... especially when I see it getting voted for over something like Standoff.

    Couldn't disagree more.  Then again, this is coming from a guy that really liked Bog on COD4.
        Bog was and will always be one of my favorite maps of call of duty. Another would be crossroads (i think). 
            Overgrown and Creek were two of my favorites.
            Crossfire perhaps?
        I loved Bog because you had to be so careful moving anywhere in that map, we need more maps like this in BO2.
TRUTH!
What maps do you like? 
    Slums, nuketown, raid, hijacked, and yemen. Standoff reminds of a really shitty map from MW3, I think it's called Fallen or something. It's a sniper and camper fest. I like it for SnD and that's about it.
        Fallen was a huge pile of shit packed into one grassy urban block. I do like Standoff, though.
            I know. They both have that depressing urban feel to me, and they both demand similar styles of play. I don't like either, though Standoff is better than Fallen. Fuck Fallen; easily the worst map in mw3, and that's saying a lot considering how shit the maps in that game were.
                I'll have to agree with you on Fallen, although when fucking Interchange got picked I wanted to lay down and shed a tear or two.
                    Interchange was so bleh. But I'd say Resistance was a really shitty map, too. A lot of space but everyone clusters the very middle room.
                Downturn nothing was worse then downturn  
        >Yemen

Your opinion is automatically invalid...
            Your opinion is automatically rude. 
            You don't like Yemen? Your opinion is automatically also invalid.
I used to enjoy standoff a lot I still think its a very well put together map but I feel like it has some of the worst spawns ever recently. Idk maybe just me. 
Run the 870 and stay indoors, and its a lot of fun.
I was so glad when they announced Nuketown would be preorder/DLC only so I knew I wouldn't have to play it as I never preorder game. Then they went and gave it to everyone. Shit sucks.
Swear. Bonus - I had just joined the lobby and meltdown was the defending map
Does not compute
She actually plays on my account more than I do. She hates Nuketown. 
Says the lag switcher...
    Sure thing bro...
True story. 
why didn't you vote on Nuketown?
    Because nuketown sucked dick in bo1 and it sucks dick in bo2.

Then again OP plays TDM so it is surprising he doesn't like nuketown.
    I'm working on gold ballista and I'm doing the cherry blossom and art of war camo so I have no perks or attachments on it
        You do them both at once?
            Yea I just prestiged it the first time so I just took off the perks. Then you can work on 2 camos at once while you unlock attachments again
                Two major camos in half the time, I do it that way as well. My brother-in-law was astounded when he found out I did it that way, apparently it never crossed his mind. 
you are the reason the Call of Duty community gets such a bed rep.
    Holy shit ... calm down and learn to take a fucking joke.
        I think he would take it better if it wasn't so terrible.
            You uptight cunts need to relax.

        Wait, that was a joke? 

Pro tip: Jokes are supposed to be funny.
lelelelelele
Checkmate, atheists.
Oh. So...
    so normally everyone always gets a hard on for nuketown when it pops up so its a rare sight to see it not get voted for. 
I wonder if Treyarch keeps track of voting.  It'd be interesting to see exactly how high Nuketown's win percentage is when it comes up
    I'm going to say 98.237%
It's hardly even camping on that map as much as just trying to hold your position.
    You can basically get spawn trapped anywhere on the map. I'm sick of it at this point.
    Yeah, but you can hide in a corner up top on either side and aim for a door, I hate that shit.
And more sniper action
    [deleted]
        But annoying to get killed by
            Only up close or getting oneshotted by a semi-auto sniper. 
                I cannot tell you how many times I got QSed today after emptying half my clip into their chest
                    This is what I like most about PC. While some people still can quick scope, it is very rare.

And no worries, I'm not one to get annoyed by console war talk. We all have our own reasons for what console we use.
                    Its also bull when they don't flinch at all, even without toughness its almost non-existent.
