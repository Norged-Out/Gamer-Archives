[[Kassadin and Ahri and many more are strong in soloq because of an item yet they get nerfed and the item stays intact. Make it make sense]]


Can they just adjust Malignance? It makes or breaks characters in the current meta its obviosly problematic and giga gold efficient. A lot more other champs abuse this item but somehow these 2 were targeted in a way that their winrate will probably tank like 4% or more. And when the item gets adjusted they will get left behind (tho more likely it will be Kassadin because Ahri is their poster girl)


They are getting the Karma treatment
    Teemo too
        I don't remember the last time I ever saw a teemo outside aram
            I mean, the first 4 days of this season teemo mains were everywhere. He had multiple srooms and could literally do what he was supposed to do, annoy the enemy team and provide A LOT of vision.
        Still waiting for them to remove Teemo shrooms from ARAM. 
Fuck balancing it, get rid of it.
            They basically did though.

Shrooms went from 3/4/5 to a 2/3/4 max shrooms they can hold. And the time it takes to recharge them is also up through the roof.

And then i'm not even talking about that snitch of a cannon minion
                And half the damage to minions.
            L take
                L brain, if any.
                    Ight I'll entertain you, what exactly bothers you/ do you think is wrong with teemo shrooms in aram?
                        No pink wards or oracles anymore. You can't do anything but wait for a cannon minion to come by, which means it's impossible to push even after an ace and it slows the game down a ton. Same issue with shaco.
                            Nah the longer the game goes on the more cannons spawn and if you get the inhib teemo becomes considerably weaker than before.
                            That's a pretty gross exaggeration of shacos capabilities. Boxes die in 1 auto/ability and aren't able to 1 shot a wave. They also don't stay on map for very long and most a wave will hit 2 or 3. Boxes won't be able to stop a push. As for teems shrooms, what else does teemo do in aram? He blinds and throws shrooms. He doesn't have the same aeo dmg as other mages. He has far less range than other mages and marksmen. He is very squishy, has no cc other than blind. I think it's OK if he kills a wave after he dies.
                                Shaco also has a box limit of 6 in aram iirc. Still obnoxious playing against him as a melee/tank since its impossible to engage him without cannon wave but not OP imo
                                Sure, Shaco's not as bad and teemo is relatively easy to kill. You asked why people thought teemo wasn't fun to play against in aram, that's why. It's not about winrate, it's that the specific mechanics he relies on aren't fun to play against, at least for me.
                                    I think teemos shrooms are actually fun to play against. It's something different that you have to pay attention to. Like a mini game. Plus, should teemo be removed from a specific game mode just because they think it's unfun? Seems like a silly take imo.
                            There are infinity cannons in aram…
                        The optimal way to use them has become spamming them down the middle of lane where minions come. If your team is pushing, the enemies die if they chase past their own minions at all. If youre being pushed in, it just becomes a game of can the mushrooms stall long enough to get you back in. Either way theyre unfun for all players but the teemo, and even then its not fun putting 90% of them in one place, and thats on an ultimate ability, which are supposed to be the most exciting abilities to use.
                        Local man can’t resist the allure of bushes or walking ahead of minions.
            Cannons and super minions reveal them. Teemo shrooms are quite weak in ARAM at this point. I've reached the point of building to make his Q and autos more useful than focusing on the shrooms at this point.
            They deal like 0 dmg to minions, are easy to clear every other wave... like idk
                ..0 damage to minions? It still does enough to wreck waves even after the nerf
                    2-3 shrooms for melees isn't really wrecking and certainly not effective or efficient. 
                They literally wreck every wave, even if they are seen they still explode on the melee minions. And he can throw them in real time + bounce making them impossible to clear unless you have at least 3 range (still alive and in range to clear them as he drops them).
But I guess if your have the MMR of a clown and you play your ARAM with iron players this probably is not an issue for you. 

Every game against a Teemo is a nightmare to end. You can disagree, but that'd just show how clueless you are. Get rid of them or bring back the oracle elixir.
                    > You can disagree, but that'd just show how clueless you are.

Yikes. In all honesty, I fully agree with your overall point about teemo in ARAM, but that's such a shitty attitude to have lol.

"If you disagree with me, it must be because you're stupid. I'm not going to listen to anyone who says anything else!" 

Get it together, bud.
                        I would not mind arguing in good faith, but wtf is that :
"They deal like 0 dmg to minions, are easy to clear every other wave... like idk"

Either it's sarcasm, in which case he's missing the /s, either it's not worth talking about/with.

If I told you "Teemo is bad in ARAM because people don't use their ult", you'd be a fool to argue with me. It's pointless and fruitless.

Also, the league of legends subreddit is the last place on the internet I'd think of arguing on, regardless of what you actually say and how well you argue/document your point. People who disagree philosophically will not bother to read/educate themselves and will downvote into oblivion regardless.
                    Factually untrue. 2-3 shrooms for melees isn't really wrecking and certainly not effective or efficient. Just shows you don't play the game.
                    [49% W/R](https://lolalytics.com/lol/teemo/aram/build/?tier=all). The only rank where he is above 50% is iron, and his W/R falls as rank increases. If you can't win vs teemo on aram then that's on you bro.
            Kiddo Aram Player, be quiet
    Good. I hope that champ sees the nerfbat so many times that she Never ever leaves botlane again 😭
        I wouldn’t mind seeing her as long as it’s without Ma’ligma’s insane damage. 

At first, in previous seasons, I used to think thought her RQ was OP in most lanes, but I had found out her scalings were trash which forced her to tech into utility or indirect damage sources. I found that pretty cool with how she could leverage one strength into another later on

Now I see her going full AP Ma’ligma and it feels AHHHHHH with how she is such a one trick pony now, it feels cheap to play against
            I think it is exactly the same problem ap shyv has. 

When your whole shtick is basicly undodgeable atomic bombs (dragonform E and RQ respectivly) its supremly stupid to play against.
                >basically undodgeable atomic bombs

RQ may be hard to dodge, but it’s easy to avoid. Karma has absolutely no backline access, so if you just position properly she will never damage you.
                    Thats 100% true and 100% irrelevant at the same time depending on what Champion you play. Good luck avoiding a midlane karma hugging her ADC as melee midlaner
                        Sure, but there’s plenty of other champs that shit on melee mid laners too. The fact that you get counterpicked sometimes does not make a champion OP.
                            I did not say with one word that i think she is OP. I only said that she is absolutly atrocious to play against in mid and she should kindly piss off to botlane. I stand by that still 🤐
                People always discredit how much damage Shyvanas ult deals in AP builds

Landing onto squishies with your fly in, is absolutely a core part of her damage. Not just her breath from a distance
                    It really depends on what you need to be doing at the current moment. AP Shyv has the ability to seriously chunk and sometimes oneshot enemies from afar, in some situations you're getting more damage from ulting backward because you'll be alive long enough to deal more damage. I can think of a couple champs I'm just not ulting onto as glass cannon AP Shyv.
                    Just played with AP Shyv on ARAM that seemed to rely solely on the R damage. She jumped in, almost always landed just on Poppy and Pantheon, promptly died (who would have guessed) and started blaming everyone for not following up.
                Karma had an added bonus of also being really fast and healing and shielding a shit ton, which only adds to the frustration of playing against her
                Karma is on a hard timer tho compared to Shyv.
                Bronze level take
        MFs when a champ designed to be a midlane mage is playable as a midlane mage and not just a shit support. Same MFs when support play a midlane mage instead of enchanter/tank: reeeeee
            Totally agreed.
            If you start using punctuation in your sentences that would help. I damn near had a stroke Reading that and am still not sure i got your meaning
                Not my problem if you cant understand English. Both of my sentences are gramatically correct, I havent skipped any necessary stuff. Also not my fault english is too basic and lacks real punctation, which many more complex languages have.
                    Ah Look. You are indeed able to form coherent sentences! Congratulation!

*edit also your whole Point is somehow extrapolating my opinion on whole classes of champions from my opinion on one (1) support being absolutly stupid to play against in mid. 

Interesting take to say the least.
                        And you are able to read, congrats!

Karma was literally designed to be a midlaner but was pushed out of it like most other mages (zilean, velkoz, brand, zyra). And people always cry that people play mages as supports then people cry when people play mages in their original role. What if people would stop crying if a mage is able to play the game and also carry and not just be a wave clearing slave?
                            You are making the biggest strawman Argument ive Seen in a while here. I have Not Said a single word about any mage support other than karma and not a single thing about another midlaner than karma. 

Since you cant stop putting words in my mouth i will just stop responding now. Maybe Go argue with the persons that allegedly hold the opinions you are arguing against, not with someone that has not said a single word of the above.
        She never belonged bot anyway... She and Seraphine were supposed to be supportive utility midlane mages, not shield/heal bots with mediocre everything else.
            Please, they sealed Seraphine's fate when so many parts of her kit got bonuses off of interacting with allies. They should have known that Passive, W, and R being strictly better with allies nearby would push her into support.
    Karma is outright unplayable now... makes me sad. I wish they removed Malignance and reverted all changes.
        Maybe use her RE more, because it got gigabuffed.
            I just want to RQ one shot people. RE is a waste of R as it doesn't reset the timer.
                Yep, that explains the comment and downvotes. I got into a platinum 4 peaker debate. That’s awkward.
                    Rude
        Not sure if I’d call 48% winrate on 3 roles „outright unplayable“
    No, it's called the Riot Special. It's a tale as old as time. Item is broken. Champions are abusing it all over the place. The champions are nerfed, making them dependent on the item now. Further down the line, Riot realizes that "oopsie daisy, it was the item all along" and nerfs the item. Then the champions are in a shit spot unless Riot happened to buff them in compensation (which was fairly uncommon in the past).
Just give Malignance an internal cooldown and you can undo all these nerfs
    That works for kassa and corki but tbh i dont think ahri gives a shit about maligances dmg. It's the r cdr that's important to her and even if maligance dealt 0 dmg she would still get it
        honestly the CDR makes kassadin activate at lv 11 instead of 16 so it's kinda big too.
            Maybe they should make the ult CD scale with lvl like they do with the lethality slow item
                Serlyda does not scale wtih level, it scales with how much letgality you have
                    then maybe make ult cdr scale woth how much regular cdr you have?
                        That's tough because I think Ability Haste is already in low supply. Could be wrong, but I see that potentially warping builds around it. It either warps builds or it gets forgotten about.
                            It's not in low supply, it's just not on any of the big utility or burst items that make the big numbers happen or stop an enemy's big numbers from happening (BV, Zhonya's, Shadowflame, Stormsurge, Void, and Deathcap).

AA/Seraph's, Malignance, Cosmic Drive, and Luden's all give 25 normal haste. 4 items for 50% CDR is very good if spell slinging is your character's thing. That's a LOT of mana, too. Cryptbloom and Horizon Focus are also really good haste items.
                                And out of 3 of those items, you're only building 1 because there's no need for multiple mana items unless you're Ryze
                                    You're trading raw damage for cooldowns. No one ever asked if building raw CDR was going to be the optimal choice or whether some stats are wasted. That's irrelevant here. The point is there is a ton of haste available if you want to go that route, and Seraph's makes sure the mana doesn't go completely to waste with a bigger shield and more AP.

We're not talking about need. But it's not like a set like this is bad in and of itself.

Luden/Malignance/seraph (whichever you need/want), Cosmic Drive, Horizon, Cryptbloom, DCap, Sorcs.

That's a total of 85 haste, which is 46% CDR. I honestly don't see the problem here. That's more than was ever achievable before ability haste existed. You can bump that to 50% if you're okay with letting sorcs slide...but probably shouldn't do that.
                            Tbf, we really don’t need AH in the game atm. Cooldowns are already so low for most champs that the traditional counterplay of abusing openings is much more restricted. It’s IMO one of the poorer design philosophies Riot has picked up in the recent seasons. 

Everyone talks about the damage being the problem, but I’d prefer high damage rewarding landing skills, but being harshly punished for missing them. Doesn’t feel that way at the moment as rotations come back up pretty quickly.
                        That gives it a quadratic scaling which is probably not what you want.

It would have to be balanced around builds with lots of haste, which would make it bad in all other cases.
                            idk I was just throwing shit out ngl. Maybe you could give it a RoA type of deal where ult CD goes up per a certain time period to a cap? or give it something like Axiom Arc's passive but touch the numbers a bit and just remove the ult cd altogether? idk I'm literally just spitting out whayever comes to mind lmao
                        There's already not a lot of it, and unlike lethality, it gets less effective the more you have
                Maybe they should just not make stupid items like this in the first place.

Had high hopes for this season at the start once they removed mythics but Riot cannot take a single step forward without taking 2 steps back.
                    The second they announced that shit it was so obvious it would be going down this same path. Riot makes unique item that is overtuned for certain characters>they nerf the character and make them reliant on said items>nerf the item to trash tier dragging the nerfed champs with it.
            But Kassadin has always activated at 11...
                People are still stuck years ago where 11 and 16 was a gigantic difference in power level. 16 is still a good spike but it's not what it was
                    yup, kass comes online with items, not levels (need 11 ofc)

still u get 2,5 sec ult cd without malignance rn at 11 with some haste/Ultimate Hunter
            That's been the case for a few years now.

lvl 11 kassa is strong enough to impact the game. By 16 he should be at a winning position for the most part
        Maybe it's not enough to nerf Ahri but it sure is good for the other 5 champs that got mega nerfed and are now forced to build the same item every game
            Just make it have an 8s cd already, kass getting faster ults is fine but a mr shred into qwe is a lot of bonus damage, malignance being both a utility and damage/pseudo pen item is dumb
            Yep 100%

Although i think then the item is built by only 2 champs. Malzahar and Lissandra
            I feel like Ahri's problems stem from how automatic her waveclear is.

Is there really any need to have both a Q which will oneshot the backline without any special attention (not really any specialist item rushes / AP thresholds to hit / or require dematerisaliser) *AND* a W which has a baked in execute when under 20% hp?

Its way too easy to hit perfect CS with her and that catalyses any of her other issues.
                Which is kinda weird, i remember the first times i played ahri a couple seasons ago i needed dematerializer at least on the mages, now q just insta clears them.
                    Pretty sure that was the time where every midlaner went demat, so that wasn't just an ahri thing
                It’s insane you’re downvoted for this lmao, the reason she’s broken is the threshold for her to full clear a wave with Q got much lower with the AP ratio increase. You’re completely correct and it’s bizarre you have any downvotes for it
                Why is this comment downvoted lol? Ahri can just press q+w and be moving to bot/jungle already on any wave that is not cannon, that alone gives her so much pressure that allows her to do whatever she want in the map. Im sure that if ahri didn't have such a strong waveclear so early her winrate would drop even if malignance remains strong.
        Yeah, malignance is mainly about the cdr not the damage
        Ult haste + a good chunk of ability haste on one item is pretty crazy.
            It only costs 2700 gold too. Hexplate is 3k. Why is the mage version so much cheaper when mages are even more ult gated than bruisers?
        To my knowledge one of the top ahri one tricks doesn’t even build it. He goes lich -> ludens in a lot of games.
            https://www.deeplol.gg/champions/ahri/mastery/all

idk who you are referring too but almost all of them are building malignance
                LegitKorea is who I’m referring too, I might be out of date then
            OPT or not, the overwhelming data supports Malignance > Lich Band is the most effective build for Ahri atm.
                The data is a bit skewed though, the playstyle for Malig first is different.

You likely only fight with your ult if it’s on such a short CD, whereas LB you can be aggro outside of the CD, which is arguably more difficult but could pay off better.
                    Yeah  but the problem is that her fighting capabilities with malignance and ult are far superior.

Malignance gives a total of 45 AH to ult. If you get +5 from GM, 50AH translate into 33%CDR, for each 1 min of the ult, she will reduce it by 20 seconds. Consider Ahri's Ult, it's CD are 130/105/80. With malignance + gm now her ult CD is 87/70/53. She can pretty much get this before 11 mins. Now you have to deal with an ahri who can TF way more often. Outside malignance  she would need at least 2 items to achieve the same spam capability. God forbid she gets vantage in lane and she gets more items early, from lvl 11 onwards it becomes toxic getting sniped that easy. She will be able to use her ult just to kill you without i
objectives on map just because she can B, get back with more items and have her ult ON again.
                    I have no idea why you’re mentioning LB to support Malignance data being off FOR AHRI which it should not be. Lolanalytics also puts put their methodology and it looks pretty solid to me. 

I have no opinion on what Malignance is like for champs that aren’t Ahri but for her the CDR on Ult gives her a cycle of 3+ dashes w/ passive damage that can proc her Lich Bane auto while she weaves in QWE.
                        …..LB is LichBane shortened….. figured that would be obvious in the context of “items on Ahri”.

I’m just saying Malignance playstyle is different than Luden’s into Lich.
                            OH! My mind immediately went to LeBlanc (probably because I used to OTP her a few years back). 

Also to clarify, I was saying Malignance INTO Lich Bane not necessarily Malignance is better than Lich Bane. Even though I think both Mal into LB and Mal > LB are both best/true atm.
                                That’s definitely fair lol, I know it’s the same acronym for both, I coulda just said Lich like I did in the second response I guess :p

It’s really good on Ahri, even the damage is decent, I just tend to assume a 120AP item could outperform it in some situations, and if you’re going to take Luden’s you don’t need the extra mana > AP.
                The data supports that there is very little to no difference between Malignance and other builds. It definitely isn't even 1% over ludens or something.

It's really not at all the reason Ahri gets nerfed or w/e. People acting like Ahri is the same as Teemo is crazy.
            One tricks are not a good source for what the best builds are, many have suboptimal builds because it fits their playstyle or they're used to it.
        As an Ahri player I endorse this message
    Or "charge" resource like Luden's so Ults with shorter cooldown would be weaker and longer ones stronger.
        It already kinda does this. The puddle size scales with damage.
            puddle size is big enough even on champs that spam ult so it isnt really a big deal
            Which is why Lux, Karma, and Corki have large pools and ults they can cast every <25 seconds, and champs like Malzahar, Ahri, and Annie have small ones with ults closer to 60 seconds.

It's not balanced by cooldown, but rather by multihit/dot vs burst.
    IT ALREADY HAS.
    if you think this is the problem you obviously havent played the champs with maligma
        yeah these champs are not a problem anymore, after the nerfs 👍
        What's maligma?
    It has one, it's the same cd as duration of teemo R I think
        It's actually 3 seconds CD, so Teemo shrooms (4 sec poison) proc it twice! Yayy :)
            Oh yeah I forgot to mention that it's actually a bit shorter since I remember it does proc twice lmao
    or maybe actually playtest your game and stop releasing broken ass items.
    It has a 5s or more icd
    Not really thought? Ahri and Kass wouldn't mind, while Swain Malz Annie etc would be shafted.
Why do people think the damage portion of the item is relevant. It’s basically useless. The amount of ult cdr you get is absurd on such a cheap item.
    Yep all the power of the item is in the ult AH and the mpen
    The damage is complete garbage, literally irrelevant. It’s basically an extra scorch proc. The haste has been its strong point since the damage nerfs way back in the season so idk why people get hung up on the damage, either.
        Because it’s visual, ult CD is something only the user sees and gets entangled with general AH, making it less clear (invisible) to the player.
            I understand the idea that people react to what they see but it really doesn’t take much to hover the tooltip and see that fed karthus has only gotten 2k damage out of it in 30 minutes
    yeah, i even buy it on champs that dont deal damage with their ult but have insane value, like bard and zilean lol.
It’s step 1 of the Riot Special.

They’ll nerf Malignance eventually, after nerfing all the champions who use it first leaving them all double nerfed.
    Ahri Q got damage buffs two months ago.

Ahri's HP/level got buffs two months ago.

Ahri E got cooldown buffs three months ago.

Ahri R got cooldown buffs a year ago. 

--

Clearly, there's another element here aside from the "double nerf."

Also who gives a shit if she gets "double nerfed"? She's by far the most dominant Midlaner in the game, going by win, ban, and pick rates.
        It’s not just Ahri who uses Malignance.

Teemo, Karma also relies on Malignance as a crutch and got absolutely shafted as a result with nerfs
            what the fuck happened to my goalposts they were there a second ago
                i think you are confused grandpa the op of this said championS not arhi
                it was clearly a continuation of my original point
        Ahri was getting buffs prior to the item changes because she wasn’t performing. She had mana issues in lane, she couldn’t assassinate anyone without a considerable lead, she wasn’t a good contributor to team fight damage overall, she was just in an overall weaker state. The emergence of these items has changed her to a 1 item spiking champ where she was not that since DFG.
        yes but both nerfs are kinda big,one would be sufficient to bring her in line and actually if you addressed the actual problem (malignace) none would be needed

before all these buffs she was near unplayable with the item changes (before malignace became a staple),one more reason to point at the item and not at the champion's kit being the problem
        Dude you are not really taking an ahri buff from a year ago for her current state right? A buff that was done because she was absolutely shit to play? The other buffs in retrospect wasnt needed if the players knew how to build her from the start
            Do buffs expire after a certain amount of time?
                No but the context for them does. Just fucking remove the ability haste from maligma
                    Buffs compound regardless. I agree that Malignance is overpowered but Ahri is also overtuned right now.
            She did need them at the start of the season. We knew what to build but it wasn’t until the dmg buff where she became slightly overtuned
            the fact remains that shes power creeped her way into the number 1 blind pickable mid laner
                Ahri is not blind pickable. People keep saying that when she has straight counters Lock in Zed, Akali,Yasuo and she's in for a rough time.
                    low elo ahri abuser detected, none of those are counters. and she doesnt have any real counter as she can neutralise any bad lane
                        Sorry to break it to you 90% of the game is played in low elo not high elo. And the low elo is what brings in the money.
                            Yes and high elo is what is balanced around 99% of the time. So whats the point in even bringing low elo up in a balance discussion? Almost never is a change aimed for them because things like meta don't even matter down there.
                            People in low elo are humans who are capable of learning. It might take them a little longer, but they do it all the time. So if the reason something is strong or weak in low elo is lack of knowledge on the player's part, it is reasonable to ask that player to just learn.
                    Ahri is very blind pickable, she’s good into zed and can control the wave easily against Akali/zed, she may struggle with yasuo but even then can still waveclear with no threat. She’s safe as hell with great waveclear and decent ways to lane into melee and ranged. Shes the definition of blind pickable
                    Ahri wins or goes even in all of these matchups. Like you could not have picked worst champions to suggest as counters.
                    ? not a single one of those champs give ahri a rough time.

she wins at least 51% of the time against every one of those champs if you look at the stats alone.

And just based of me playing ahri. None of those champs provide any problems in the slightest
                        I agree with you but I also want to point out that a lot of these champions have less than 50% win rates because they’re mechanically intensive. So using statistics to determine what “should” happen might be a bit skewed because on average people are losing on these champs which makes ahri look better into them. (She’s still good into all of them, I just don’t love the Winrate metric)
                            well neither do I usually but if the stats are 51-55% wr in pretty much all ranks, its a safe argument to make in my book.

 I should think that the ahris and zeds in master rank at least know how their champs work, yet its still almost 55% wr to ahri
                                That’s fair! I think you’re right!
            1. Ahri was awful at the start of the season none of the items worked on her.

2. People have been going between Ludens and Malig since PBE but again both items were awful

3. Ahri could not do any damage at the start of the season, her WR kept going down as the season progressed

4. Ahri got the buffs because she can't do anything and is reliant on her team to do damage, she's an assassin imagine not being able todo damage as an assassin.
                Shes an "assassin" with amazing wave clear and self sustain in lane.

no other assassin has that in an even game state, she shouldnt do as much dmg as assassins.

The reason she is nr 1 right now is because she can do assassin shit while have an extremely safe laning phase and managing 10/cs a min AND following roams, initiating roams and pulling off side lane ganks
                    She’s not even number 1. Idk where this comes froms. She’s not the number 1 midlaner and all assassins out damage her. 

Ahri has good wave clear good roam and a great mobility but that’s where it ends. 

She’s literally rank 20 on LoL Analytics. 
Ahri is just the most popular midlaner because she’s 1. Cute 2 fox girl  3. Faker
                        Shes rank 3 on lol analytics

Shes nr 1 on numerous high elo tier lists.

Also youre quoting third party stat sites but you still considering yasuo, akali, zed hard counters despite them saying otherwise? nothing youre saying makes sense mate, sorry
        though kassadin is getting R AP ratio nerfed by 15%.
        pepermint farm remembers Ahri dangling around 48% WR before the Q buff, with Fizz and Akali Nuking tanks
        Yes. And if you go back to reddit before these buffs, people were memeing that Ahri was non-existent and did 0 damage.
    They said they were happy with AP items for the foreseeable future while nerfing Teemo, Gwen & co, yet nerfed those items just 2 patches later without going back on the nerfs(minus gwen getting buffed since the nerf was just THAT bad), lmao.

Everyone keeps saying "the riot special" is just a meme but fuck no, it's real
    Ahri probably should've been nerfed a long time ago anyway. She wasn't as strong because players were building her wrong. If they had to nerf the champs, I don't get why they don't nerf their ult cds only. I know Ahri did, but she got a W nerf too and then there's Kass who got his ult damage nerfed. But at the same time, nerfing malignance seems like a no-brainer. I guess Riot is trying to approach nerfs to champs as opposed to items since mythics don't exist anymore. 

Side note, I did some numbers. There are some Ahri players that take Sorcery secondary with Transcendence which gives 10 more AH and along with Ult Hunter, gives 31 ult haste. 20 from Malignance. 15 AH from Lichbane and 25 AH from Malignance itself gives Ahri a total of 81 ult haste or 71 without Transcendence. 

So her current ult CD at level 11 with 81 ult haste has a 58s CD (61s CD with 71 ult haste). With the planned nerfs, her ult will have a 63s CD with 81 haste (67s CD with 71 ult haste). At the same time, don't you think its a little wrong that champs like Ahri can stack 2 AH items and have a 1 minute ult CD? Malignance isn't even making up a lot of that with the 20 ult haste since it also gives the standard 25 AH.
        >Ahri probably should've been nerfed a long time ago anyway.    
   
   
Jesus the overexaggeration is strong in this one. She got buffed in 14.4 that is 3 patches ago or in other terms at most 2 months probably closer to a month and a half in which she's been good. Before that she was straight up terrible one of the worst champions in the game at the time and no people building her wrong was not the issue. She was just bad.
            You're telling me Ahri with 5% AP ratio on Q and slight HP growth in 14.4 meant Ahri was playable? I somewhat overexaggerated but she was being played a lot in pro too.
                10% since her q has two dmg instances also she got an old e-CD nerf reverted on 14.2 aditionally it probably also helped that riot buffed malignance by 5AH in 14.4 and made it cheaper in 14.3.     
The cumulative amounts of buffs she and her items needed is honestly a testament to how shit they were.
                    At the same time, Stormsurge also got nerfed 3 patches in a row from 14.1 hot fix to 14.3. This is also probably a reason as her matchups changed.
    Yup. Rito Special is looking at a problem, then dealing with the symptoms rather than fixing the cause.
    That's because Riot's balance team makes changes that only the mentally insane would make because it causes chaos and makes a lot of champions more fun to play, but miserable to play against.
    And eventually come out with a Learnings Dev Article about how their lack of oversight on Malignance led to the current State of Balance. They'll be sorry and ensure thorough communication in the years to come. Thanks for sticking by Riot throughout all these years. In compensation, here's a Ward skin for your loyalty.
hmmm nerf 2 champions, or buff 10+ champions??????? XDDD
They never should have made it a mana item bc this situational effect is too garbage on almost all mages but so strong on specific ones. It would have been a perfect legendary like Hexplate or Axiom but they essentially made it a mythic item. 

Whilst at the same time all the mages who have basically plummeted in wr and feel awful to play now because they lost Liandry are being forced to go manaless builds or buy it anyways despite it being bad.
    I think it would be okayish for it to be a mana item if the other ones weren't this bad. Ludens is so bad everyone gets seraphs instead and seraphs rush is complete ass on half the mage roster because it does basically nothing until it's upgraded and even then it deals no damage
        So true. Ludens honestly is the worst feeling item in the game. No pen on it, so you're just fully relying on the proc damage, but then you can't clear waves for 15 seconds in order to use it.

Awful item. Tbh stormbringer could've been reworked into the ludens replacement, then it also reduces abuse by assassins
            Luden's only feels strong when it breaks spellshields like EoN or banshee's.
        tear into liandry into seraph is kinda insane on some mages though (I tried it on Vik and Taliyah currently)
    This has been my biggest complaint of the AP item changes. We went from 4 total Lost Chapter items to three, with one of them (Malignance) being incredibly champ-specific. If you're playing Taliyah, Syndra, Hwei, Viktor, Ryze, Zoe, and some more you are never building Malignance - and half of these champs can't even proc the passive.
        I am not saying it is good, but why technically not on Syndra, Hwei or Viktor? On Syndra you use your ult for poke in lane quite a bit thus having it more often and having the 3/4 balls after the first one do more dmg throught hte pen doesnt seem so bad. On Hwei, if you hit ult, you would use the pen for the explosion and the severing bolt no? And Viktor uses ult for waveclear/poke so having it more often would also help a bit no? Maybe I am wrong in my assumptions or my view on these champs is skewed by proplay (mainly Viktor, maybe Syndra) but I would rather build this than Luden and in some cases than Seraphs.

On the other hand, Ryze especially doesn't really mind no? He builded Seraph anyways and you still have Rod of ages that you don't really want to build on many champs other than him.

But I agree that overall the change feels quite bad since Liandrys doesn't give mana anymore and it was one of the most useful items for mages.
            Size of Malignance field scales with damage per hit. Multi-hit ultimates do very little damage and thus make a tiny field for the shred
                While this makes sense and would make them less usefull, Syndra's ult hits quite fast so I think most of it would still hit in the tiny field (at least on the edge of the field from each orb). But I may be wrong in that regard
                    The orbs would all benefit from the bonus but you’d end up losing a lot of the AOE value from it. They’d take maybe 50(?) damage from Malignance puddle and the rest of your combo with Ult-start likely wouldn’t benefit from it.
                        Maybe I played her wrong for the most part, but I usually ended the combo/skrimish with ult, but regardless, you are right that it wouldnt give enough value and certainly not for other skills. I wasnt saying that Malignance was significantly good on Syndra as I havent played her much since the changes and didnt look at the statistics, was just proposing that it is not as unusable as the original comment said.
            Syndra could be one of the better users out of the list, but I generally believe Malignance is still her weakest LC item out of the three. Archangels gives defense through the shield and safe scaling, where as Luden's offers an aggressive build path with Alternator in it and has a better damaging passive.

Hwei - I think Malignance is just really bad on him. With the way the item works he always gets an absolutely tiny Malignance puddle and by the time the slow has ramped up (for the QW follow up) they're long out of it.

Viktor -I don't know, it might be decent on him actually.
            Malignance isn't *terrible* on Hwei, but Hwei doesn't really depend on his ult as much as other champions. So he doesn't get as much use out of the effect or the CDR.
    I think its a mana item because it would be very broken on Vlad and Kennen

It's kinda like a limiter in a sense
        It's broken on everyone who can use it th

Like who'd have thought having your ult up on images would be strong
        Might be pretty scary on Rumble too.
    Liandry should never have been made into a mana item. Giving all mages such consistent and standard access to % hp magic damage dot as their standard item buy was one of the biggest issues with top lane meta (and to a lesser extent jungle). The game just had so much % hp damage (along with stuff like divine sunderer) that it destroyed the tanks (which is why they had to keep buffing tank damage, because they melted to everything)
        Mages were not tank shredding anyone, it was Divine Sunderer and Bork which invalidated tanks in toplane. Especially Sunderer which caused the issue you were mentioning. And now with the MR items we have, no mage (not AP bruisers) is shredding any tank or bruiser if people are being honest with themselves.

Toplane was and is still dominated by bruisers who are basically almost as tanky whilst dealing almost the same dmg as an ADC.
            >Toplane was and is still dominated by bruisers who are basically almost as tanky whilst dealing almost the same dmg as an ADC.

fuck bruisers like garen darius etc but still adc have way more range which is most important stat at 4+ items
            As a top main, yes, 100% this. Shen main, Shenpaiislife, and having hardswapped sunfire cape on shen for divine sunderer & titanic the moment the items dropped, I can say with absolute certainty they were a MASSIVE power spike, even before heartsteel abuse was a thing, on any tank or bruiser.
                It's mind-boggling how long it took for them to nerf Sunderer and even this new iteration of Sunderer is only being properly nerfed now in pbe despite it being so centralising.
                    Yep, i dont play on pc anymore, but every support I play on wildrift builds titanic hydra & sunderer. If I played PC, I'd absolutely build sunderer on bard too it's just THAT good. Granted, I played bard as a tank, not an enchanter or "mage"
                        Doesn't really work on PC, supports just don't really have the gold to get both titanic and sundered in a reasonable time frame. Supports usually sit on support item +1 completed item for awhile unless they snowball hard. This is especially the case for bruiser items as they tend to be pricier than support items by a significant margin (3300/3100 for titanic/sundered)
                            Well.. top laners sit on two completed items for a while unless they snowball, too. Should they stop building bruisers' items, too? Jugglers sit on completed jungle item +1 completed item for a while as well. Should they stop building bruisers' items, too? Yes, it'll take longer to complete them. But if you're paying attention to the game state and your gold gain consistency across matches, you can easily adjust your playstyle and build order to better accommodate varying factors in the gold "deficit" that supports apparently have
                                Top laners still consistently are getting gold to build more items. If supports and top laners build the same items, top laners will be building them significantly faster. (also many bruiser items scale well with base stats/champ level, which top laners will have more of).

Bruiser items frankly aren't that amazing when you are behind in items, but are really strong when you are ahead compared to any other class.

Theres also a big difference between titanic + sundered compared to like solstice sleigh + sundered.

There's a reason there are 0 supports right now that build bruiser items outside of camille (who isn't doing so hot since nerfs to bloodsong). And camille is mostly there because she abuses bloodsong harder than any other champ (best sheen user in the game)
            I wouldn't call it tank shredding or that Liandry's was the main issue. However it definitely did contribute since pretty much every role in the game did significant damage to tank champions. While this was exacerbated by a lack of good MR items (outside of maybe FoN), and particularly no mr items you could build first, it didn't matter what role was attacking the tank, tanks just weren't tanky.

The issue with most mages right now is that luden's is kinda bad, and many of them feel much worse with the significant decrease in AH on mage builds.
                except that for the ones who can build them current liandry + riftbaker are far worse than old liandry (+ demonic)

the only difference is that the mages who actually struggle against tanks have no option left
                    Classically, tanks are supposed to counter mages for the most part. It was part of the reason the adc role existed was to kill tanks.

And idk, as much as gwen/morde is a pain to deal with as tanks, that is also heavily because of their kit (and I'd still rather play against them than play tanks on mythic item patches)
                        liandry mostly helped to deal with bruisers,tanks stacking MR never really suffered from it

and while I agree on what you said there is a difference between being countered and having an hopeless matchup,liandry ensured it was only the latter

point is liandry was never problematic on the champion you are afraid would become too strong against tanks with it
                            I disagree that liandries is decent into bruisers or tanks for that matter. I think wed see alot more mages top and mages splitpushing into enemy toplaners if it was. But we dont cause mages dont have the initial burst to kill through bruiser items and dont have the mobility to survive extended fights where liandries would see value.
                            To an extent yes, however during mythic items, there wasn't much MR for tanks to build. Most of the MR items gave like 40 MR, and none of them were first items (only jak'sho had MR for first tank item). It's why rumble, despite getting much better liandry's and more anti-tank damage in his kit is largely performing much worse into tanks this season relatively.

As a tank player at least, it is far less painful to play into magic damage now, and you are drastically tankier (unless it's like brand/lillia/asol or some other %hp magic damage champ that also build liandrys)
Sure, because then champions that are ok but not broken with the item can still build it.
    On a scale of 1 to "Didnt she just fucking ult?" i rate champs like Lissandra the latter
Holy fuck rather have ahri op than 20 zeds or yasuos a day
    I might be crazy but nah, zed and yasuo might be more frustrating to fight or lane against but ahri is way more efficient at actually winning games and yoinking lp
        People on reddit would rather lose lp to champs like Ahri and Janna than get solokilled by Zed or Yone
        I think Ahri is just a much harder champ to read. I always find it pretty easy to track how an Yas or Zed is going to play a fight, but Ahri just has so many more options
        I find ahri more frustrating to play against personally, she becomes literally unkillable post 6.
            Not me managing to have negative KDA on ahri.
    i'd rather have ahri or yas against me yeh

its a good food
        says the vex fizz player lol
    that's because you don't know how to play vs them and haven't faced a good ahri
        I don't think you even need to face a good Ahri when she just kills you by existing as a squishy with W R and Lichbane after horribly missing Q and E
        Or maybe due to personal preference / depending on your pool because I could tell you exactly the same about ahri to you
            not really you're just playing in low elo, where ahri isn't anything special
    
Ahri is for sure way more frustrating to play against than Zed btw
        That’s entirely subjective
            Yes, it's subjective and it comes down to personal opinion. That being said, a lot more people find Zed more frustrating than Ahri. Zed is specifically left weak precisely because Riot knows most of the playerbase hates playing against it
                I wonder if riot plans to change zed’s kit?
I really don't get why they made the effect have no cooldown at all. Champs that initially looked like they would go crazy with it, like Malzahar and Karthus do ok with it, but not nearly as good as those with ults that have crazy uptime on their ults (Teemo, Kassadin, Anivia, Kog Maw, ...).
    this serves as a balance lever. There are basically two groups which would in theory like this item:
"I have an impactful ultimate and want to use it basically off-cd to make a play" like malzahar, karthus, fidfle sticks.
or "I have a low cd ult already and can make use of the bonus magic reduction fields whenever I use my ult" such as anivia or swain. I know malignance is not the most purchased item on these champions, most of the time because of spike issues or there simply being a better lost chapter item available - however, if riot would want to buff the item, they could specify for which group they wish to buff it instead of making it to strong for one group. they could let it give more ultimate haste (karthus or fiddlesticks would benefit more) or let the magic fields be more impactful (better for anivia or teemo as they do not care as much about the ultimate haste.)
        Well, actually just cause the CD is already low doesnt mean the Haste isnt still great for the champs. Especially Kassadin is pretty happy to have less time between ults
    this is such a bad take. The active effect is literally irrelevant. The ultimate haste is why the item is disgusting on some champions.
    It does have a cooldown tho.
        Right. 3 second per target just looked it up. TIL
    imo item feels turbo shit on malz, i only build it as a 3rd item
Ahri's R cooldown was 140 / 115 / 90 last year before they buffed it to what it is now.

That aside Ahri got two buffs in 14.4: 8HP per level and Q AP ratio increased by 10 percent points.

The champ is just really fucking strong and has been really strong for a long time.

Maligma breaks Ahri as much as Kraken Slayer breaks Jinx. Yep they're their best items, who gives a fuck, the champs are simply really strong right now.
    >10 percent points

I love you for this
Yeah rengar and kayn got that treatment cause of profane hydra as well.
I don’t think this is that difficult to understand.  Kassadin and Ahri have better winrates compared to other malignance users, therefore they are getting a nerf.
well on one side that makes sence. nerfing the champs only affects them, 

nerfing items affects many champs, and indirectly affects many more that suddenly get better matchups against effected champs. 

on the other side, eventually riot will change /remove the items anyways and allways forgets some of the champs they nerfed to compensate,  in the worst cases this may break entire kits , or add up over time, resulting in things like sivir.
    Like J4, who took 8 patches at sub48% wr to get a partial revert to nerfs that happened because goredrinker and old shojin were giga buffed
        yea. my personal favorite example is sivir though. every second line in all of her 5 abilitys are the result of some item interaction they wanted to get rid off,  resulting in her being incredibly volatile and having complealty unique interactions with 0 mentions in the tooltips.
Something I havent seen discussed is the champs it brings up into competitiveness. I think we have a larger pool of effective champs because of this item. If they nerf the item we could see a tighter meta around mid/mages. So they first try to nerf the champs who are doing too well. I think id rather see champs like ahri and kass get nerfed then lose out on more options for mage effectiveness. I could be totaly wrong though.
The item is fucking bonkers late game, as squishy champions the burn circle will single handedly zone me out of a fight, love getting 100-0 by a teemo shroom with the burn circle respawning on me
Malignance should just be removed at this point. Balancing it around low ult cooldown champs just means it’s useless on everyone else
    It should be removed or nerfed. I was playing Azir yesterday and my ult CD was 30 seconds with Malignance, Ultimate Hunter, and almost no other CDR.
    Why do people think this? The active is legit garbage. The item is completely carried by giving 45 ability haste total to champions reliant on their ult cd.
    At the very least it needs to be adjusted accordingly. Right now the only limiting factor for these low cd ults is that the radius is smaller on the burn area created by it. The damage is still the same, and being able to get multiple procs of it within a fight is insane. Give the "hatefog" a cooldown of 10 seconds so it doesn't proc more than 2 times in a fight, no matter which champion you're playing.
It's pretty silly that Riot announced that they'd be moving away from "Playing the item" situations by removing Stride and Gore but for some reason released Malignance which is either completely core on some champs if not OP, while being borderline unusable on basically everyone else. I think Swain is the only champ where this item is situational. 

There are a bunch of champions who could use a DPS-centric mana item so I don't know what they were thinking making such a bipolar item that deals both DoT but works best on burst-y champs and can only be bought on a select amount of champs instead of keeping the one aspect of Mage mythics that was it's diversity intact.
    Maglinance isn’t gameplay defining but amplifying.

That’s the difference. Champs that like to ult buy malignance to ult more often and have it be stronger.

Champs that bought gore suddenly became drain tanks even though they weren’t.
        Sure but what about Stridebreaker? It didn't quite change gameplay all that much, simply allowed champs who like to chase people have an easier time doing it. I would say even Goredrinker didn't change gameplay all that much. Yes, it allowed certain fighters to sustain more than they did before, but it's still amplification of gameplay.

There are a bunch of champs who like to ult more often, want it to be stronger, center around their ult, that can't buy Malignance or feel like it's suboptimal on them, like Malzahar.
            Stride is still in the game.

Old Stride got removed because it removed the entire counterplay of juggernauts (being kiteable) by giving them an on-demand dash.
                Sure, but it is in a state considerably weakened. And I don't think Stride removed the counterplay in the way you mean unless you are talking about the time when it had that dash, which point I'd agree totally.

I don't think Gore defines gameplay to a lesser extent than nerfed Stride or Malignance does if the former were to be nerfed in the manner items like Stride or Liandry were to.
                    I have no idea what you’re talking about.

Stride rewards champs that want to stay close to you by slowing you, making it harder to get away - before this state, it gave you a dash which was broken and had to be removed.

I don’t understand what you mean with „weakend state“ it’s exactly the same as last seasons stride.

Gore defined your gameplay. You became a drain tank when you bought it, even though you weren’t supposed to be one. It changed your gameplay like old stride or galeforce by giving you tools that you weren’t supposed to have.

Malignance only makes your ult stronger just like Rabadons makes your abilities stronger. Everyone who likes to ult buys that item. Even malzahar, even though you named him in champs that don’t want to buy it (no idea why, it’s his most purchased item)

Liandries is supposed to be an anti tank item that also compliments champs that have dps in their kit.
                        Agreein with you here, just clarifying


Stride helps you stick to people, not aproach people. It is there so that once you get close to someone, they cant get away. It doesnt help you get in if your champ can't do it already.

Something like gore made champs who couldnt normally sustain on longer fights be able to. Sundered sky does the same now too. They patch a weakness instead of amplifying your strenght
                            Yea this
                        > I don’t understand what you mean with „weakend state“ it’s exactly the same as last seasons stride.

No? It's slow is weaker considerably compared to it's mythic version, to the point where they had to go around and buff champs like Garen and Darius who used it who were now in the dumpster. It used to deal 175% total AD with a 40% slow for 3 seconds, not it deals %80 AD with a 35% slow that decays over 3 seconds, on top of having overall lower stats and not having haste anymore. 

> Gore defined your gameplay. You became a drain tank when you bought it, even though you weren’t supposed to be one. It changed your gameplay like old stride or galeforce by giving you tools that you weren’t supposed to have. 

Not really. Most of the champs who bought it were those who wanted to slug around in middle of the fight, those with both innate sustain or other means of surviving in the fight. It didn't change the fundamental gameplay of any champion outside of the situations where it was so strong that it could have the gameplay defining effect you describe, but those situations were short and were taken care of by Riot quickly.

> Even malzahar, even though you named him in champs that don’t want to buy it (no idea why, it’s his most purchased item)

He buys it, but he doesn't want to. Right now the optimal build, in terms of damage and utility, is manaless build of Liandry into Rylai into whatever, but because Malz cannot go manaless like Swain, Brand, etc. can, he HAS to buy Malignance. This is why Malz is much weaker this season compared to previous one, why his winrate fell by 2 percent, and why a Rioter came to Malz mains discord and asked his mains their opinions about changes they would make.

> Liandries is supposed to be an anti tank item that also compliments champs that have dps in their kit. 

Okay? That's not my point. My point is that I don't believe Gore would be that egregious if it's passive was nerfed considerably in the same way Stride and Liandry were nerfed to get in line as a legendary item.
    The difference is that activating malignance is very much about your champion kit. Swain with malignance doesn't feel like Ahri with malignance.

They still need to do something about repeat triggers though. Annie tibbers triggering it again on every tick of the burn is ridiculous.

None of the other mana AP items feel remotely exciting so I don't mind them trying something different to fix that.
        Sure but you'd think a champ like Swain who can constantly amply the pools through his ult would love this, but because his use with the MPen portion is limited and he doesn't get that much mileage out of the Ulti Haste, so it remains a bit suboptimal. 

I agree that other AP mana items are just really unsatisfying. Again, mage mythics were pretty much okay, especially in their diversity, so I'm really not sure why Riot just ditched that and gave us a bunch of mana items that are mostly unsatisfying outside of Malignance, which is locked to certain champs.
            Yeah the biggest issue with the item is that it can't decide if it's a DoT item or a Mpen item. The truth is that it's an ultimate haste item.

On the other hand I don't think the mana items were particularly better last season.
                > The truth is that it's an ultimate haste item.

It's an ultimate haste item but in a really wonky way, where it's good if you can use it to either spam your spammable ult more or if you can be like Ahri and abuse the ulti haste in a way where your ult can have almost no cooldown at all at later levels. 

I thought mage mythics were decent last season, and I definitely enjoyed the aspect of almost every mage having at least 3 different mythic options they could switch around to decent enough satisfaction depending on the situation. It was certainly better than our current situation of having to choose between different types of meh.

This is absolutely not my experience. Ludens by default is what I remember.
                        Nah there were plenty of Liandry users (Viktor this season for instance is feeling shitty due to the loss of liandry mythic) or crown users. Lots of ROA users too (anivia, ryze, swain depending on game etc). As lux there were plenty of games where it was good to go either ludens or liandry
                            Liandry users picked their Liandry and never looked at other items. Same with RoA users. If you weren't one of those, it was Ludens and you weren't excited about it. So Ludens by default.
                                > Liandry users picked their Liandry and never looked at other items.

Swain could and would go Luden's into certain teams regularly. Similarly Cass could easily go Liandry into certain teams.
                                    Swain could and would go liandries, ludens, and ROA lol.
                                "ludens by default except for all the mages who didn't use Ludens which was probably more than half"
                                    Well yes, that's the concept of default. If you had anything especially synergistic with your kit you'd pick that and you'd end up with Ludens if you didn't, which felt back. The new situation is exactly the same thing but with Malignance as one of the synergy options. They didn't solve anything for the champs that unhappily ended up buying Ludens but they also didn't make anything worse either. The situation being your kit picking the mana item for you or having to pick an unexciting one was already there.
                                ? I don't know what elo you're in but there were a huge number of mages who could swap between Luden's and Liandry's last season, and you didn't need to have a special synergy to want Liandry's either. It was a common choice even on champions like Syndra, who made a decision between that and Luden's based on how squishy the enemy comp was and how much they needed the haste in a particular game.

The number of mages who were hard-locked into Luden's by lack of other options was extremely small. Almost every mage could opt into Liandry's if they felt like it.
                                Syndra could go both
                        My experience was that, which maybe skewed because I play these tanky battlemages like Swain, Vlad, Cass etc was that a lot of popular mages like Ori, Syndra, Viktor, Xerath etc. could opt for Liandry if there were enough health stackers because they got really good mileage out of the damage amp from bonus health, which at times could give up to 10 percent bonus damage on all damage. I would also regularly see some of them take Crown if the situation permitted it.
    i saw sloppywalrus video yesterday he bought it just for the CDR it gives but its unusable on his r because of the knock back which kinda funny
        Which champ?
            Gragas, Sloppywalrus is a Grag 1trick streamer.
            Gragas ig
Swap Lost Chapter with some other item and it might be less of a rush item (and give it back to Liandry's lol)
the thing about the ahri nerf that boggles me is that they make the cooldown higher, so you get rewarded more for building malignance, and get punished for building something else  
so she gets nerfed because of malignance and AD Top maybe but then they put out a nerf that makes her want the item even more...
Riot needs to draw the line between champions and items. Do we mainly balance items around champions in the game, or do we mainly balance champions around items in the game? Pick one and stick with it.
The problem is that nerfing Malignance nerfs everyone who builds it. So you have two choices:

- Nerf the worst abusers and leave Malignance alone so the champs who need it to be viable can have it

- Nerf Malignance and then need to buff most of the mage class
"Maligance can proc no more than once every 30 seconds" would make sense right?
I remember when I was excited for item changes, only for them to decrease build diversity lol
    How is build diversity ever going to exist when you can easily track winrates on item builds? Its not a solvable problem
        Its probably when you have multiple items with similar winrates. Or just have items for the game's niche.

Like, bruisers like Noc get to chose between bruiser items and tank items based on each game. Assassins to a devree get to choose between all the lethality items and some bruiser items

Mages don't have that many options or niche items, their builds get very cookie cutter and boring
        I think it's a problem you can alleviate.

The problem is that a lot of items aren't designed to be per-game situational - they're designed to be per-champion situational. Like surface level both Liandry's and Nashor's are sustained damage AP items with one being better vs tanks and the other being better vs squishies, but in practice they aren't substitutes at all. And speaking of Nashor's, it's problematic in that it's an item useless to the vast majority of the champions it's supposedly in the item class for (mages) and core on the couple that actually buy it. OTOH you have items like Morello's and Banshee's that very much are per-game situational buys, but because of those core items, you usually have to delay them, can only get one or two, and there frankly just aren't many of them.

For mages specifically, that problem is often compounded by the fact that all AP bruisers, assassins, and sustained damage dealers have to share a single item pool. The bruisers tend to be able to dip into some of the tank items for a couple slots, but their other items are still taking up space in the mage pool. Going back to the Nashor's example, it's the only attack speed item for AP champions which makes it a waste of an item pool slot for most mages, but it needs to exist for champions like Azir and Gwen that build AP and need attack speed - the result is an item a few champions really want with no alternative for it.

Mana items are also a point of issue for mages in that there aren't very many of them. Sure, there being 4 looks kind of good, but again, those have to cover multiple different sub-classes of AP champion. The result tends to be that there isn't great diversity there because those 4 options have to cover so much ground and get designed to cover a specific archetype, and since the champions that need a mana item typically really need to get it first, that bottleneck is the first thing you see every single game. AD champions get around this by simply not needing mana items most of the time, though the options for those that do are fairly lacking as well.

None of this is helped by items like DCap that are just turbo generic powerful stat slots with no alternatives.
        More impactful active items could be a step at least, less skilled players will immediately avoid them. Think things like old prowlers claw, or maybe a targeted zhonyas, or blade mail from dota. Not saying this won't get figured out, but at least we'll have more options to play with
            people want to play the champs, not the items unfortunately which is why stuff like Galeforce and Prowlers won't come back. They talked about it when they removed Prowlers from the mythics IIRC.
    Yep. Lack of any real non "meta" builds had been the biggest contributing factor to my stopping playing on PC. I don't want to build the exact same items every single game. It's boring. It's like playing an rpg the exact same way every time you play through it. Builds should be fairly fluid from game to game, adjusting for each individual game as it unfolds. Instead, it's turned into "buy these items in this order, don't even look at other items or you're griefing"
    If you were excited about item changes then you aren't familiar with riots history of item changes. This is what happens every single time. It's not about balance, It's about shaking up the meta to make their pro leagues more interesting to watch. They do this all the time with pretty much every "big balance pass".

They're not stupid, they most definitely knew about malignance before anyone else did. They've been doing this for 14 years. As long as the meta is just different that's all they care about, not balance. Same reason they change the jungle every single year and It's the same reason they change objectives/masteries/runes.
because they clearly want malignance to be a strong item or like they would say "exciting"
    Meanwhile ludens doesn't do anything in a fight because you had the audacity to kill a minion. 
    I mean it is a pretty cool item
If they are going to build the item regardless, it's still a net nerf to the champ that is abusing the item. 

I am not saying this is the correct way to do things, simply the reason behind it. 

Say you have 10 champs building the item, for 3 of them it's pushing them overpowered, and 7 of them it's just useful. If you nerf the item because the 3, you indirectly nerf the other 7 despite it not being problematic for them. So you target the champ, letting the item remain untouched so you don't make a cascading balance change. 

Once again, not saying this is the correct way to do it, just context to it. No mention of target nerfing the champ, and eventually nerfing the item without replacing the lost power to the initial champion nerfs.
    they build it because it's OP not because they use well,Ahri specifically only builds it as a stat stick the actual burn never does anything due her kit

and in this case it would be more like out of 10 users 9 became overpowered and 1 is doing ok with it

edit: by the way before the item was overbuffed malignace was the lowest winrate starting item on Ahri
        If they can make use of all the stats, then they build it because they use it well. Not making a comment on the items balance, simply pointing out that stats are just a valid reason to get an item, debabtely more than the unique effect.
            the stats are good but the item effect is horrible on Ahri that's exactly what I'm saying

the pool from her ult will be very small and she has no way to keep people inside so she pretty much only makes uses of the stats with the passive being as good as inexistent,yet it's still better than say ludens which has both good stats and an useful effect

she doesn't make full use of the item and it's still the best option,don't you see the problem?
                I understand what you are saying, but I disagree the effect is horrible on her. Unless I am misunderstanding an interaction here, her ult gets like 3 charges. Each charge fires a few bolts to nearby enemies. If she times her ult and is in a perfect scenario she can proc the pools 9 individual times. That's extra damage for free, as well as MR reduction for anyone in the pools. If she dashed in, landed a charm on you, you are now in a damage circle, with reduced MR against a decently strong burst. 

She may not be constantly procing the pool like Kassadin would, but she still can very easily benefit from the passive, along with the stats. 

Once again, I don't play Ahri, so if her ult doesn't actually proc the passive for someone reason, that's my bad.
                    the 3 sec CD usually means she procs it twice at best (even only once per target if she doesn't space a lot between ults,it takes 2 seconds to use all casts for reference),what you're describing is an extremely unlikely scenario

her E makes them walk out of the pool already on its own + you usually either use it before or significantly after proccing malognace

it's not too unusual to get 60 damage or so per solo fight unless they're a sitting duck

it really sounds good on paper but in practice this item is awful on her,besides the broken stats
The general idea is to balance champions first then item then larger systems/runes. If only a couple of champs are outliers they get adjusted rather than the item. I don't know if I always agree with that but the basic idea is good.
What would be helpful as well is at least have some AH on other items besides Malignance, Ludens, and Cosmic Drive. Champions who Synergize with Malignance get very strong ult boosts aka Corki, Karma, Hwei, etc., while Ludens users like Syndra do not get nearly as much power from an item and mainly build it as the only source of AH.
Remember the support AP damage too.

Of course they nerf fighter items 😂
idk how the fuck any sane human being looked at that item and were like "surely this will cause no problems" shit looked busted since day 1.
If the item is so broken that everybody and their mom build it, Riot should nerf the item. (like S3 BC or the recent Statikk Shiv)


If the item is broken on specific champion but is normal on other champion, Riot should nerf those outliner champion.
I hate having to build certain items because they are that good. Champions should never be nerfed because of 1 or 2 items.
Don't worry, malignance will get nerfed, and then ahri kassadin and karma will get no compensation buffs and fall to F-tier.

Does riot realize by nerfing all these champions and not malignance, it makes malignance their only viable item, since they are effectively balanced around building this item?
    No they do not. It’s been same since the release of the game.
remove the ult cd cooldown or make it scale with lvl and its done.
What do you mean these two? Teemo was OBLITERATED!
And it's trash on so many champs too.
Guess what? They’re gonna do what they always do. They’ll nerf the champ, then the item, then leave the champs in the post-nerf state following the item changes.
Because they want malignance to maintain this power level for other champs, but not those 



And tbh I'm glad because if you get malignance you assure that only those champs can ever possibly build it, I want it to be a possible choice on lux, hwei,  etc
Just remove the flat pen on it
remind me when they do this with profane hydra and forget to fix kayn afterwards
Malzahar is already in a rough spot. If they nerf malignance hes gonna be useless

but this is coming from a malz main
i find it ridiculous that I can't build black cleaver with seryldas/ldr but when kassadin gets to build 2 lost chapter items for 70 haste on his ultimate, it's all good!
Ngl that's just classic Riot Games balancing and happened to a ton of champs. It happened with the Mythics too. They balanced most champs around Mythics then removed Mythics and the champs were left in the gutter.
The Riot special, treat the symptom a bunch of times before treating the cause, and then don't undo any of the damage that came from treating the symptom.
Teemo, ahri, karma, etc were balanced in a world without malignance, so it stands to reason that introducing a new item that is powerful on them must come with nerfs to those champions. Riot *could* nerf malignance instead, but if they nerf it too much then teemo/ahri/karma just switch to a different item and then malignance is just unusable on everyone.

It does kill diverse build paths, but we all saw what happened when the item system focused on diversity first and actually-wanting-to-build-items second (mythics).
I know half thr people here are old enough to know this is the Sejuani treatment (Cinderhulk)
Not just Malignance, also Lich bane.
Riot has shares in the company that manufactures Malignance
They did this to corki as well. First strike was overpowered so they nerfed him instead
We have the collective impossible-to-guess number of experience with League's shitty balance team, and yet we still expect them to not make the same mistake over and over again?

How optimistic.
Malzahar (most built and highest winrate item is malignance) is STILL useless btw
I honestly don’t get why it even has two passives? Either it gives you 20 ultimate haste or the damage fields but both seems just excessive. The whole item is overloaded and way too good on certain champions it’s almost like this was the predictable outcome.
Please just get rid of malignance my god
Its called the riot special. Soon or later the item will get nerfed and those champion will colapse
I hate balance talks about this game. it's not productive.

  
Why? Riot knows. They have years of data. Years. They know what they are releasing. It's not as if a company like riot would release an item or champion without having tested it and having datapoints that says hey this is op. It's a conscious decision they made as a company. 

  
Same with the nerfs. 

  
Don't worry though. I'm sure Azir will still ahve 100% pressence in pro play though. 

  
I'm sure the Asol Pickrate will skyrocket. 

  
It's probaby what riot wants though. If you only pick the same 3 champions it becomes easier to balance the game around. 

  
Wouldn't want variables like a champion with a 4% pick rate. Hard to account for that. Right riot? 

  
Look. I don't care about the kassadin nerf. What I care about is riots mindset as an organization. 

Why have champions at all if you want their pickrates to be abysmal? 



Don't say its not your desire because you purposely balance champions to have abysmal pickrates.



So what about not releasing new champions for a while and just fixing the game? 

  
I understand a balanced game is a stale game. But how did we get to a point where champions are having 60% winrates anyway (smolder) how do we have an item thats so fkn busted you gotta nerf some of the most popular champions in the game.

  
How did this get past play testing, Basically is my long winded question.
Q max ahri must pay for the sins of W max
If you nerf malignance you end up nerfing champs that use it but don’t need nerfs like teemo. System wide item nerfs are always more damaging to the game than champion nerfs are. I have no Idea why they create such game altering and breaking items into the game, that can never really be balanced for all champions.
It’s the Riot special, I’ll be your guide.
Ult cooldown creep is too real.
Kassadin isnt even good comopared to ahri he's 51% wr emerald + and in any real elo he is absolutely horrid he has some of lowest damage no actual scaling in kit riot phreak could queue 50 games of kassadin in current state and he would be negative wr with gray kd.
Been saying this ever since the item existed. They’ve been nerfing every champ that starts to utilise it when prior to the item existing they weren’t the problem. 

They need to rework it or remove it, as how it currently stands is just a detriment to the game.
Ahri is a boring champion with boring design and I’m all the more glad she’s becoming less viable
Reality is they are too strong without it too.
For years now Riot's intention has never been to achieve proper balance. All they do is make stupid changes to shake up the meta and if it happens to be very unbalanced they hotfix it. They don't care about actually fixing the game in any proper way, because they want to keep things feeling "fresh" for a significant portion of the playerbase that don't like critical thought. So if there's something new that breaks the game, but is a new concept, like Malignance, you bet they will always nerf champs that can abuse it to excuse keeping it in the game.
It's Riot's loop.

Op item > pretty good on some characters > nerf those characters > nerf them again > finally nerf the item > the characters keep the nerfs, which makes them weaker than before the changes ofc > repeat
Ahri is broken with or without the item
Kassadin at arams with ultimate hunter and malignance going full mana build with tankinness is absolutely broken. Dont forget to grap conqueror too, I have never seen it heals less than 3k, imagine the damage it does.
While ahri and kassaden are broken with malignanc other mages also run it too and nerfing the item will make it balanced for ahri and kass but too weak for the other mages that can build the item
Malignance 100% needs to be reworked. It's silly that it's broken on very specific champions to the point that they catch nerfs, rather than just reworking the item to make it generally useful for more champions.
I don't know if the data supports your theory.

Ahri builds malignance almost every single game (94%), you can't easily differentiate its power from hers. 

Is Ahri good because of malignance or does malignance look good because Ahri is good and builds it almost every game?

Lich bane actually has a higher winrate on Ahri when built compared to malginance, i.e. if you have the option to buy either lich bane or malignance, lich is always the better choice at every point in the game
To be fair Ahri heals the enemy but her having ult 24/7 is pretty disgusting been an Ahri main all my life and boy oh boy me dashing 3 times every 20 seconds and getting resets is so obnoxious for the enemies especially immobile ones who need flash to usually dodge my flash charm and if it goes south I just ult away and try again with ult. Also what really annoys me is how dogshit Ludens is if they buffed ludens a lot of Ahri mains would shift to it instead I rather have 60 second ult and oneshot potential than be an ult bot and rely on lichbane to deal damage I always loved the ludens horizon focus build but it's ass now
It's better to nerf the Champ's directly than to nerf malignance.
Riot be like “we don’t want to Riot special champions anymore.”

But we all know what’s going to happen when Malignance eventually gets nerfed, cuz that item is busted.
its just funny because by adding malignance they did opposite and I mean COMPLETE OPPOSITE of what they said they wanted to do with the item changes

they said that they want to make people play champions and not items, and what do they do? They make an item that completely wraps champions around itself not unlike liandries or bork
Ahri is ALWAYS insanely strong and the moment she isn't she gets buffed to be at that level, a malignance nerf would be putting a band aid on a gaping wound.
Kassadin with the ROA playstyle has a stable slow plastyle where you need to keep the game stable until he hits 16 which is how you're supposed to play Kassadin and gives him counter play.

When you play Malignance, which is usually around level 9, you immediately start one shotting people and Kassadin becomes like a fed Akali, the champion should not exist on Kassadin where you can proc it on every r.

IMO Kassadin should not get nerfed, but Malignance should get nerfed OR the way that item interacts with Kassadin should get nerfed.
Make it have like a level requirement to unlock certain things like

Level 6: 15 second cooldown, 5 ult ability haste

Level 11: 10 second cooldown, 10 ult ability haste

Level 16: 5 second cooldown, 20 ult ability haste
    i like this
    Nah. It would be actually a decent change, so they don’t do it.
You say this but Kassadin has a pretty good winrate when he goes RoA instead and skips Malignance
malignance isnt overperforming, hell some items are performing way better on ahri.  there is literally no reason to nerf it
I agree but if you adjust Malignance, they must adjust bork aswell. And any other on hit bullshit
    Bork is tuned down, it might be an issue on Irelia but not sure, barely see that champ. What does on hit bullshit mean? On hit by design has a very linear power curve and is just good from 1st to 6th item but it does not have a ceiling as high as crit.

It seems to me like Malignance is breaking champions and making certain ones borderline broken while champs that cant benefit are left a bit in the dust since it offers insanely good stats for mages.
    What's this Reddit obsession with Botrk ffs, the item is far from broken, unlike malignance. Just get good
        It’s not that it’s broken, it just takes up so much of the power budget on champs that use it (look at Irelia)
ahri in particular just wants to build cheap af legendary mage items if it's not malignance it will be something else

it has been this way since the rework. it started with everfrost horizon focus etc. adjusting malignance won't change shit.

ahri wants gold efficiency not slot efficiency, is your plan to make all mage items have poor gold efficiency to nerf ahri? no, the champion is the problem
    not at all it's just a coincidence

she liked everfrost because her E is actually really hard to hit and pretty important for her kit 

she likes malignace for the insane ult haste you can stack with it which she relies on to make plays
        literally look at her most common builds

it is just a collection of the most gold efficient items she can afford with whatever income she gets, with rabadon's as a cherry if she's doing well. she takes absolutely no consideration as to whether an item fits well into her kit or not. vegan ahri exists in both proplay and soloqueue and is completely viable for a reason. the champion is the problem


nerfing malignance will do nothing
            her best build is malignace lich bane,then rabadons/banshee/void staff or bloom which all seems pretty normal in terms of cost,if you were right we'd see items like Shurelya,Rylai or other pure utility items,instead she always goes for damage/CDR stacking

then again you talk as if literally every single champion in the game doesn't benefit from gold efficiency and tends to build the items that give you the most
                My fault, I should have clarified gold efficient *mage* items, I did in another thread about Ahri but forgot to say it in this comment.


Items like Rabadon's and Lich Bane (or its 2nd damage item equivalent on other champions) are always going to be the highest winrate items, but the very context of their purchase is those champions being ahead enough in the game to justify the purchase to begin with. Items like Rabadon's get picked lower and lower the higher elo you go (but the win rate also goes up, because when you're ahead enough to purchase a high elo player utilizes the spike better) regardless of whatever mage you're playing because the cost is simply not as justifiable in a standard build because of how it slows down your item spikes.

The problem with Ahri is that she can freely opt into low damage builds while simultaneously being able to capitalize on more damage oriented purchases if the game state allows it. Champions like Viktor and Syndra are stuck in a hole where they *have* to build damage because purchasing for example horizon focus 2nd even though it doesn't technically fit with their kit will butcher their usefulness in a game. Ahri can be set behind and not give a single fuck  while also being a total nightmare if she is ahead in any given game.
Get used to it. It happens every patch.
same thing with the sundered sky users, nerf voli briar repeatedly, then nerf sundered. classic!
They always do this. They find out some op interaction like malignance. So rather than nerf malignance they nerf the champion which forces champs down a rabbit hole of having no choice but to build it or lose basically. If they would just balance the items it would create more versatility in the game because you would actually need to be strategic in your item selection. They keep making it funnel into one build. For example Rylais on a sol. You have to build it now days or you are trolling
cuz other champs rely on the item to be not 40% wr
Because Ahri is OP and the other ones aren't?
[deleted]
    so... they're not giving Ahri and co the "Riot special"?
Nah, keep them nerfed. Nobody actually likes the game when Kass and Ahri are good.
The item is not OP at all. Stop crying on reddit when u find something to blame
Honestly the item is interesting even though I personally HATE it. It gives champions like malz, fiddle, Annie, lux, etc all  champions who are extremely old and ult reliant and normally completely unplayable a lot of play.

I like the idea, but honestly it's super shitty to play against.
Riot's balancing data is skewed by rampant scripting and smurfing. Until recently, everyone thought scripting was so rare most people would peg it at around 1/100 games max. Riot recently came out and said it's 1/5 to 1/15 games having AT LEAST ONE scripter, depending on ELO and Region. 

Everyone knows that Smurfing is a far more rampant issue than scripting, so it's very likely that nearly every game has at least 1 Smurf in it depending on region and ELO.

All the stats they have, cannot account for or filter this info, meaning all the balance changes they're making are AROUND the rampant scripting and smurfing in the game, meaning the game balance is wildly incorrect from actual gameplay experience. 

This game's Ranked system has 0 competitive integrity and nobody should bother playing until probably 6 months after the roll out the new anti cheating features.
Thats Riot and Phreak for you, dont try to make sense on any of their decisions, they will nerf Maligmas in a future patch and theyll keep the same stats for all the nerfed champs, this isnt the first time and the last time this will happen
Malignance is by far the most problematic item in YEARS. It made Karma viable as a midlaner overnight. It made TEEMO META for a few days. Imagine an item that can do that for the most meme picks ever. 

Yeah, Riot needs to remove it ASAP. It is not a healthy item for the game.
Mages finally feel like a champion and not a walking sack of 300 gold and everyone looses their shit. Bruisers and Assassins however can just run around causing terror and everything is fine.
Volibear lost one of his most interesting, and fun-when-it-works builds (full crit) because Sundered Sky, an item that is probably gone at the end of the season, is coded as a critical strike.

The answer is: They have absolutely no idea what they're doing right now, and they're trying to salvage 2 years of Mythic item failures.

Give me back my 1-shot Voli, you bastards.
All the bronzies in the chat thinking if they just nerf the only viable item for some champs, it'll be fine for the two most broken champs in midlane this season. There are no other mana items except seraph and new ludens which is absolute garbage but yeah remove malignance LOL
There shouldn't be ult cdr specifically on items. It's impossible to balance, since the characters weren't concieved with it in mind.
    Generic ability haste exists and is possible to balance. There's nothing about ultimate haste that makes it impossible to balance. One point of ultimate haste is worth less than generic ability haste, so there's some ratio that is balanced.
    Which other sources of ultimate ability haste have caused balance issues? We've had multiple others, some in the game for years.
Teemo too
    I don't remember the last time I ever saw a teemo outside aram
        I mean, the first 4 days of this season teemo mains were everywhere. He had multiple srooms and could literally do what he was supposed to do, annoy the enemy team and provide A LOT of vision.
    Still waiting for them to remove Teemo shrooms from ARAM. 
Fuck balancing it, get rid of it.
        They basically did though.

Shrooms went from 3/4/5 to a 2/3/4 max shrooms they can hold. And the time it takes to recharge them is also up through the roof.

And then i'm not even talking about that snitch of a cannon minion
            And half the damage to minions.
        L take
            L brain, if any.
                Ight I'll entertain you, what exactly bothers you/ do you think is wrong with teemo shrooms in aram?
                    No pink wards or oracles anymore. You can't do anything but wait for a cannon minion to come by, which means it's impossible to push even after an ace and it slows the game down a ton. Same issue with shaco.
                        Nah the longer the game goes on the more cannons spawn and if you get the inhib teemo becomes considerably weaker than before.
                        That's a pretty gross exaggeration of shacos capabilities. Boxes die in 1 auto/ability and aren't able to 1 shot a wave. They also don't stay on map for very long and most a wave will hit 2 or 3. Boxes won't be able to stop a push. As for teems shrooms, what else does teemo do in aram? He blinds and throws shrooms. He doesn't have the same aeo dmg as other mages. He has far less range than other mages and marksmen. He is very squishy, has no cc other than blind. I think it's OK if he kills a wave after he dies.
                            Shaco also has a box limit of 6 in aram iirc. Still obnoxious playing against him as a melee/tank since its impossible to engage him without cannon wave but not OP imo
                            Sure, Shaco's not as bad and teemo is relatively easy to kill. You asked why people thought teemo wasn't fun to play against in aram, that's why. It's not about winrate, it's that the specific mechanics he relies on aren't fun to play against, at least for me.
                                I think teemos shrooms are actually fun to play against. It's something different that you have to pay attention to. Like a mini game. Plus, should teemo be removed from a specific game mode just because they think it's unfun? Seems like a silly take imo.
                        There are infinity cannons in aram…
                    The optimal way to use them has become spamming them down the middle of lane where minions come. If your team is pushing, the enemies die if they chase past their own minions at all. If youre being pushed in, it just becomes a game of can the mushrooms stall long enough to get you back in. Either way theyre unfun for all players but the teemo, and even then its not fun putting 90% of them in one place, and thats on an ultimate ability, which are supposed to be the most exciting abilities to use.
                    Local man can’t resist the allure of bushes or walking ahead of minions.
        Cannons and super minions reveal them. Teemo shrooms are quite weak in ARAM at this point. I've reached the point of building to make his Q and autos more useful than focusing on the shrooms at this point.
        They deal like 0 dmg to minions, are easy to clear every other wave... like idk
            ..0 damage to minions? It still does enough to wreck waves even after the nerf
                2-3 shrooms for melees isn't really wrecking and certainly not effective or efficient. 
            They literally wreck every wave, even if they are seen they still explode on the melee minions. And he can throw them in real time + bounce making them impossible to clear unless you have at least 3 range (still alive and in range to clear them as he drops them).
But I guess if your have the MMR of a clown and you play your ARAM with iron players this probably is not an issue for you. 

Every game against a Teemo is a nightmare to end. You can disagree, but that'd just show how clueless you are. Get rid of them or bring back the oracle elixir.
                > You can disagree, but that'd just show how clueless you are.

Yikes. In all honesty, I fully agree with your overall point about teemo in ARAM, but that's such a shitty attitude to have lol.

"If you disagree with me, it must be because you're stupid. I'm not going to listen to anyone who says anything else!" 

Get it together, bud.
                    I would not mind arguing in good faith, but wtf is that :
"They deal like 0 dmg to minions, are easy to clear every other wave... like idk"

Either it's sarcasm, in which case he's missing the /s, either it's not worth talking about/with.

If I told you "Teemo is bad in ARAM because people don't use their ult", you'd be a fool to argue with me. It's pointless and fruitless.

Also, the league of legends subreddit is the last place on the internet I'd think of arguing on, regardless of what you actually say and how well you argue/document your point. People who disagree philosophically will not bother to read/educate themselves and will downvote into oblivion regardless.
                Factually untrue. 2-3 shrooms for melees isn't really wrecking and certainly not effective or efficient. Just shows you don't play the game.
                [49% W/R](https://lolalytics.com/lol/teemo/aram/build/?tier=all). The only rank where he is above 50% is iron, and his W/R falls as rank increases. If you can't win vs teemo on aram then that's on you bro.
        Kiddo Aram Player, be quiet
Good. I hope that champ sees the nerfbat so many times that she Never ever leaves botlane again 😭
    I wouldn’t mind seeing her as long as it’s without Ma’ligma’s insane damage. 

At first, in previous seasons, I used to think thought her RQ was OP in most lanes, but I had found out her scalings were trash which forced her to tech into utility or indirect damage sources. I found that pretty cool with how she could leverage one strength into another later on

Now I see her going full AP Ma’ligma and it feels AHHHHHH with how she is such a one trick pony now, it feels cheap to play against
        I think it is exactly the same problem ap shyv has. 

When your whole shtick is basicly undodgeable atomic bombs (dragonform E and RQ respectivly) its supremly stupid to play against.
            >basically undodgeable atomic bombs

RQ may be hard to dodge, but it’s easy to avoid. Karma has absolutely no backline access, so if you just position properly she will never damage you.
                Thats 100% true and 100% irrelevant at the same time depending on what Champion you play. Good luck avoiding a midlane karma hugging her ADC as melee midlaner
                    Sure, but there’s plenty of other champs that shit on melee mid laners too. The fact that you get counterpicked sometimes does not make a champion OP.
                        I did not say with one word that i think she is OP. I only said that she is absolutly atrocious to play against in mid and she should kindly piss off to botlane. I stand by that still 🤐
            People always discredit how much damage Shyvanas ult deals in AP builds

Landing onto squishies with your fly in, is absolutely a core part of her damage. Not just her breath from a distance
                It really depends on what you need to be doing at the current moment. AP Shyv has the ability to seriously chunk and sometimes oneshot enemies from afar, in some situations you're getting more damage from ulting backward because you'll be alive long enough to deal more damage. I can think of a couple champs I'm just not ulting onto as glass cannon AP Shyv.
                Just played with AP Shyv on ARAM that seemed to rely solely on the R damage. She jumped in, almost always landed just on Poppy and Pantheon, promptly died (who would have guessed) and started blaming everyone for not following up.
            Karma had an added bonus of also being really fast and healing and shielding a shit ton, which only adds to the frustration of playing against her
            Karma is on a hard timer tho compared to Shyv.
            Bronze level take
    MFs when a champ designed to be a midlane mage is playable as a midlane mage and not just a shit support. Same MFs when support play a midlane mage instead of enchanter/tank: reeeeee
        Totally agreed.
        If you start using punctuation in your sentences that would help. I damn near had a stroke Reading that and am still not sure i got your meaning
            Not my problem if you cant understand English. Both of my sentences are gramatically correct, I havent skipped any necessary stuff. Also not my fault english is too basic and lacks real punctation, which many more complex languages have.
                Ah Look. You are indeed able to form coherent sentences! Congratulation!

*edit also your whole Point is somehow extrapolating my opinion on whole classes of champions from my opinion on one (1) support being absolutly stupid to play against in mid. 

Interesting take to say the least.
                    And you are able to read, congrats!

Karma was literally designed to be a midlaner but was pushed out of it like most other mages (zilean, velkoz, brand, zyra). And people always cry that people play mages as supports then people cry when people play mages in their original role. What if people would stop crying if a mage is able to play the game and also carry and not just be a wave clearing slave?
                        You are making the biggest strawman Argument ive Seen in a while here. I have Not Said a single word about any mage support other than karma and not a single thing about another midlaner than karma. 

Since you cant stop putting words in my mouth i will just stop responding now. Maybe Go argue with the persons that allegedly hold the opinions you are arguing against, not with someone that has not said a single word of the above.
    She never belonged bot anyway... She and Seraphine were supposed to be supportive utility midlane mages, not shield/heal bots with mediocre everything else.
        Please, they sealed Seraphine's fate when so many parts of her kit got bonuses off of interacting with allies. They should have known that Passive, W, and R being strictly better with allies nearby would push her into support.
Karma is outright unplayable now... makes me sad. I wish they removed Malignance and reverted all changes.
    Maybe use her RE more, because it got gigabuffed.
        I just want to RQ one shot people. RE is a waste of R as it doesn't reset the timer.
            Yep, that explains the comment and downvotes. I got into a platinum 4 peaker debate. That’s awkward.
                Rude
    Not sure if I’d call 48% winrate on 3 roles „outright unplayable“
No, it's called the Riot Special. It's a tale as old as time. Item is broken. Champions are abusing it all over the place. The champions are nerfed, making them dependent on the item now. Further down the line, Riot realizes that "oopsie daisy, it was the item all along" and nerfs the item. Then the champions are in a shit spot unless Riot happened to buff them in compensation (which was fairly uncommon in the past).
That works for kassa and corki but tbh i dont think ahri gives a shit about maligances dmg. It's the r cdr that's important to her and even if maligance dealt 0 dmg she would still get it
    honestly the CDR makes kassadin activate at lv 11 instead of 16 so it's kinda big too.
        Maybe they should make the ult CD scale with lvl like they do with the lethality slow item
            Serlyda does not scale wtih level, it scales with how much letgality you have
                then maybe make ult cdr scale woth how much regular cdr you have?
                    That's tough because I think Ability Haste is already in low supply. Could be wrong, but I see that potentially warping builds around it. It either warps builds or it gets forgotten about.
                        It's not in low supply, it's just not on any of the big utility or burst items that make the big numbers happen or stop an enemy's big numbers from happening (BV, Zhonya's, Shadowflame, Stormsurge, Void, and Deathcap).

AA/Seraph's, Malignance, Cosmic Drive, and Luden's all give 25 normal haste. 4 items for 50% CDR is very good if spell slinging is your character's thing. That's a LOT of mana, too. Cryptbloom and Horizon Focus are also really good haste items.
                            And out of 3 of those items, you're only building 1 because there's no need for multiple mana items unless you're Ryze
                                You're trading raw damage for cooldowns. No one ever asked if building raw CDR was going to be the optimal choice or whether some stats are wasted. That's irrelevant here. The point is there is a ton of haste available if you want to go that route, and Seraph's makes sure the mana doesn't go completely to waste with a bigger shield and more AP.

We're not talking about need. But it's not like a set like this is bad in and of itself.

Luden/Malignance/seraph (whichever you need/want), Cosmic Drive, Horizon, Cryptbloom, DCap, Sorcs.

That's a total of 85 haste, which is 46% CDR. I honestly don't see the problem here. That's more than was ever achievable before ability haste existed. You can bump that to 50% if you're okay with letting sorcs slide...but probably shouldn't do that.
                        Tbf, we really don’t need AH in the game atm. Cooldowns are already so low for most champs that the traditional counterplay of abusing openings is much more restricted. It’s IMO one of the poorer design philosophies Riot has picked up in the recent seasons. 

Everyone talks about the damage being the problem, but I’d prefer high damage rewarding landing skills, but being harshly punished for missing them. Doesn’t feel that way at the moment as rotations come back up pretty quickly.
                    That gives it a quadratic scaling which is probably not what you want.

It would have to be balanced around builds with lots of haste, which would make it bad in all other cases.
                        idk I was just throwing shit out ngl. Maybe you could give it a RoA type of deal where ult CD goes up per a certain time period to a cap? or give it something like Axiom Arc's passive but touch the numbers a bit and just remove the ult cd altogether? idk I'm literally just spitting out whayever comes to mind lmao
                    There's already not a lot of it, and unlike lethality, it gets less effective the more you have
            Maybe they should just not make stupid items like this in the first place.

Had high hopes for this season at the start once they removed mythics but Riot cannot take a single step forward without taking 2 steps back.
                The second they announced that shit it was so obvious it would be going down this same path. Riot makes unique item that is overtuned for certain characters>they nerf the character and make them reliant on said items>nerf the item to trash tier dragging the nerfed champs with it.
        But Kassadin has always activated at 11...
            People are still stuck years ago where 11 and 16 was a gigantic difference in power level. 16 is still a good spike but it's not what it was
                yup, kass comes online with items, not levels (need 11 ofc)

still u get 2,5 sec ult cd without malignance rn at 11 with some haste/Ultimate Hunter
        That's been the case for a few years now.

lvl 11 kassa is strong enough to impact the game. By 16 he should be at a winning position for the most part
    Maybe it's not enough to nerf Ahri but it sure is good for the other 5 champs that got mega nerfed and are now forced to build the same item every game
        Just make it have an 8s cd already, kass getting faster ults is fine but a mr shred into qwe is a lot of bonus damage, malignance being both a utility and damage/pseudo pen item is dumb
        Yep 100%

Although i think then the item is built by only 2 champs. Malzahar and Lissandra
        I feel like Ahri's problems stem from how automatic her waveclear is.

Is there really any need to have both a Q which will oneshot the backline without any special attention (not really any specialist item rushes / AP thresholds to hit / or require dematerisaliser) *AND* a W which has a baked in execute when under 20% hp?

Its way too easy to hit perfect CS with her and that catalyses any of her other issues.
            Which is kinda weird, i remember the first times i played ahri a couple seasons ago i needed dematerializer at least on the mages, now q just insta clears them.
                Pretty sure that was the time where every midlaner went demat, so that wasn't just an ahri thing
            It’s insane you’re downvoted for this lmao, the reason she’s broken is the threshold for her to full clear a wave with Q got much lower with the AP ratio increase. You’re completely correct and it’s bizarre you have any downvotes for it
            Why is this comment downvoted lol? Ahri can just press q+w and be moving to bot/jungle already on any wave that is not cannon, that alone gives her so much pressure that allows her to do whatever she want in the map. Im sure that if ahri didn't have such a strong waveclear so early her winrate would drop even if malignance remains strong.
    Yeah, malignance is mainly about the cdr not the damage
    Ult haste + a good chunk of ability haste on one item is pretty crazy.
        It only costs 2700 gold too. Hexplate is 3k. Why is the mage version so much cheaper when mages are even more ult gated than bruisers?
    To my knowledge one of the top ahri one tricks doesn’t even build it. He goes lich -> ludens in a lot of games.
        https://www.deeplol.gg/champions/ahri/mastery/all

idk who you are referring too but almost all of them are building malignance
            LegitKorea is who I’m referring too, I might be out of date then
        OPT or not, the overwhelming data supports Malignance > Lich Band is the most effective build for Ahri atm.
            The data is a bit skewed though, the playstyle for Malig first is different.

You likely only fight with your ult if it’s on such a short CD, whereas LB you can be aggro outside of the CD, which is arguably more difficult but could pay off better.
                Yeah  but the problem is that her fighting capabilities with malignance and ult are far superior.

Malignance gives a total of 45 AH to ult. If you get +5 from GM, 50AH translate into 33%CDR, for each 1 min of the ult, she will reduce it by 20 seconds. Consider Ahri's Ult, it's CD are 130/105/80. With malignance + gm now her ult CD is 87/70/53. She can pretty much get this before 11 mins. Now you have to deal with an ahri who can TF way more often. Outside malignance  she would need at least 2 items to achieve the same spam capability. God forbid she gets vantage in lane and she gets more items early, from lvl 11 onwards it becomes toxic getting sniped that easy. She will be able to use her ult just to kill you without i
objectives on map just because she can B, get back with more items and have her ult ON again.
                I have no idea why you’re mentioning LB to support Malignance data being off FOR AHRI which it should not be. Lolanalytics also puts put their methodology and it looks pretty solid to me. 

I have no opinion on what Malignance is like for champs that aren’t Ahri but for her the CDR on Ult gives her a cycle of 3+ dashes w/ passive damage that can proc her Lich Bane auto while she weaves in QWE.
                    …..LB is LichBane shortened….. figured that would be obvious in the context of “items on Ahri”.

I’m just saying Malignance playstyle is different than Luden’s into Lich.
                        OH! My mind immediately went to LeBlanc (probably because I used to OTP her a few years back). 

Also to clarify, I was saying Malignance INTO Lich Bane not necessarily Malignance is better than Lich Bane. Even though I think both Mal into LB and Mal > LB are both best/true atm.
                            That’s definitely fair lol, I know it’s the same acronym for both, I coulda just said Lich like I did in the second response I guess :p

It’s really good on Ahri, even the damage is decent, I just tend to assume a 120AP item could outperform it in some situations, and if you’re going to take Luden’s you don’t need the extra mana > AP.
            The data supports that there is very little to no difference between Malignance and other builds. It definitely isn't even 1% over ludens or something.

It's really not at all the reason Ahri gets nerfed or w/e. People acting like Ahri is the same as Teemo is crazy.
        One tricks are not a good source for what the best builds are, many have suboptimal builds because it fits their playstyle or they're used to it.
    As an Ahri player I endorse this message
Or "charge" resource like Luden's so Ults with shorter cooldown would be weaker and longer ones stronger.
    It already kinda does this. The puddle size scales with damage.
        puddle size is big enough even on champs that spam ult so it isnt really a big deal
        Which is why Lux, Karma, and Corki have large pools and ults they can cast every <25 seconds, and champs like Malzahar, Ahri, and Annie have small ones with ults closer to 60 seconds.

It's not balanced by cooldown, but rather by multihit/dot vs burst.
IT ALREADY HAS.
if you think this is the problem you obviously havent played the champs with maligma
    yeah these champs are not a problem anymore, after the nerfs 👍
    What's maligma?
It has one, it's the same cd as duration of teemo R I think
    It's actually 3 seconds CD, so Teemo shrooms (4 sec poison) proc it twice! Yayy :)
        Oh yeah I forgot to mention that it's actually a bit shorter since I remember it does proc twice lmao
or maybe actually playtest your game and stop releasing broken ass items.
It has a 5s or more icd
Not really thought? Ahri and Kass wouldn't mind, while Swain Malz Annie etc would be shafted.
Yep all the power of the item is in the ult AH and the mpen
The damage is complete garbage, literally irrelevant. It’s basically an extra scorch proc. The haste has been its strong point since the damage nerfs way back in the season so idk why people get hung up on the damage, either.
    Because it’s visual, ult CD is something only the user sees and gets entangled with general AH, making it less clear (invisible) to the player.
        I understand the idea that people react to what they see but it really doesn’t take much to hover the tooltip and see that fed karthus has only gotten 2k damage out of it in 30 minutes
yeah, i even buy it on champs that dont deal damage with their ult but have insane value, like bard and zilean lol.
Ahri Q got damage buffs two months ago.

Ahri's HP/level got buffs two months ago.

Ahri E got cooldown buffs three months ago.

Ahri R got cooldown buffs a year ago. 

--

Clearly, there's another element here aside from the "double nerf."

Also who gives a shit if she gets "double nerfed"? She's by far the most dominant Midlaner in the game, going by win, ban, and pick rates.
    It’s not just Ahri who uses Malignance.

Teemo, Karma also relies on Malignance as a crutch and got absolutely shafted as a result with nerfs
        what the fuck happened to my goalposts they were there a second ago
            i think you are confused grandpa the op of this said championS not arhi
            it was clearly a continuation of my original point
    Ahri was getting buffs prior to the item changes because she wasn’t performing. She had mana issues in lane, she couldn’t assassinate anyone without a considerable lead, she wasn’t a good contributor to team fight damage overall, she was just in an overall weaker state. The emergence of these items has changed her to a 1 item spiking champ where she was not that since DFG.
    yes but both nerfs are kinda big,one would be sufficient to bring her in line and actually if you addressed the actual problem (malignace) none would be needed

before all these buffs she was near unplayable with the item changes (before malignace became a staple),one more reason to point at the item and not at the champion's kit being the problem
    Dude you are not really taking an ahri buff from a year ago for her current state right? A buff that was done because she was absolutely shit to play? The other buffs in retrospect wasnt needed if the players knew how to build her from the start
        Do buffs expire after a certain amount of time?
            No but the context for them does. Just fucking remove the ability haste from maligma
                Buffs compound regardless. I agree that Malignance is overpowered but Ahri is also overtuned right now.
        She did need them at the start of the season. We knew what to build but it wasn’t until the dmg buff where she became slightly overtuned
        the fact remains that shes power creeped her way into the number 1 blind pickable mid laner
            Ahri is not blind pickable. People keep saying that when she has straight counters Lock in Zed, Akali,Yasuo and she's in for a rough time.
                low elo ahri abuser detected, none of those are counters. and she doesnt have any real counter as she can neutralise any bad lane
                    Sorry to break it to you 90% of the game is played in low elo not high elo. And the low elo is what brings in the money.
                        Yes and high elo is what is balanced around 99% of the time. So whats the point in even bringing low elo up in a balance discussion? Almost never is a change aimed for them because things like meta don't even matter down there.
                        People in low elo are humans who are capable of learning. It might take them a little longer, but they do it all the time. So if the reason something is strong or weak in low elo is lack of knowledge on the player's part, it is reasonable to ask that player to just learn.
                Ahri is very blind pickable, she’s good into zed and can control the wave easily against Akali/zed, she may struggle with yasuo but even then can still waveclear with no threat. She’s safe as hell with great waveclear and decent ways to lane into melee and ranged. Shes the definition of blind pickable
                Ahri wins or goes even in all of these matchups. Like you could not have picked worst champions to suggest as counters.
                ? not a single one of those champs give ahri a rough time.

she wins at least 51% of the time against every one of those champs if you look at the stats alone.

And just based of me playing ahri. None of those champs provide any problems in the slightest
                    I agree with you but I also want to point out that a lot of these champions have less than 50% win rates because they’re mechanically intensive. So using statistics to determine what “should” happen might be a bit skewed because on average people are losing on these champs which makes ahri look better into them. (She’s still good into all of them, I just don’t love the Winrate metric)
                        well neither do I usually but if the stats are 51-55% wr in pretty much all ranks, its a safe argument to make in my book.

 I should think that the ahris and zeds in master rank at least know how their champs work, yet its still almost 55% wr to ahri
                            That’s fair! I think you’re right!
        1. Ahri was awful at the start of the season none of the items worked on her.

2. People have been going between Ludens and Malig since PBE but again both items were awful

3. Ahri could not do any damage at the start of the season, her WR kept going down as the season progressed

4. Ahri got the buffs because she can't do anything and is reliant on her team to do damage, she's an assassin imagine not being able todo damage as an assassin.
            Shes an "assassin" with amazing wave clear and self sustain in lane.

no other assassin has that in an even game state, she shouldnt do as much dmg as assassins.

The reason she is nr 1 right now is because she can do assassin shit while have an extremely safe laning phase and managing 10/cs a min AND following roams, initiating roams and pulling off side lane ganks
                She’s not even number 1. Idk where this comes froms. She’s not the number 1 midlaner and all assassins out damage her. 

Ahri has good wave clear good roam and a great mobility but that’s where it ends. 

She’s literally rank 20 on LoL Analytics. 
Ahri is just the most popular midlaner because she’s 1. Cute 2 fox girl  3. Faker
                    Shes rank 3 on lol analytics

Shes nr 1 on numerous high elo tier lists.

Also youre quoting third party stat sites but you still considering yasuo, akali, zed hard counters despite them saying otherwise? nothing youre saying makes sense mate, sorry
    though kassadin is getting R AP ratio nerfed by 15%.
    pepermint farm remembers Ahri dangling around 48% WR before the Q buff, with Fizz and Akali Nuking tanks
    Yes. And if you go back to reddit before these buffs, people were memeing that Ahri was non-existent and did 0 damage.
They said they were happy with AP items for the foreseeable future while nerfing Teemo, Gwen & co, yet nerfed those items just 2 patches later without going back on the nerfs(minus gwen getting buffed since the nerf was just THAT bad), lmao.

Everyone keeps saying "the riot special" is just a meme but fuck no, it's real
Ahri probably should've been nerfed a long time ago anyway. She wasn't as strong because players were building her wrong. If they had to nerf the champs, I don't get why they don't nerf their ult cds only. I know Ahri did, but she got a W nerf too and then there's Kass who got his ult damage nerfed. But at the same time, nerfing malignance seems like a no-brainer. I guess Riot is trying to approach nerfs to champs as opposed to items since mythics don't exist anymore. 

Side note, I did some numbers. There are some Ahri players that take Sorcery secondary with Transcendence which gives 10 more AH and along with Ult Hunter, gives 31 ult haste. 20 from Malignance. 15 AH from Lichbane and 25 AH from Malignance itself gives Ahri a total of 81 ult haste or 71 without Transcendence. 

So her current ult CD at level 11 with 81 ult haste has a 58s CD (61s CD with 71 ult haste). With the planned nerfs, her ult will have a 63s CD with 81 haste (67s CD with 71 ult haste). At the same time, don't you think its a little wrong that champs like Ahri can stack 2 AH items and have a 1 minute ult CD? Malignance isn't even making up a lot of that with the 20 ult haste since it also gives the standard 25 AH.
    >Ahri probably should've been nerfed a long time ago anyway.    
   
   
Jesus the overexaggeration is strong in this one. She got buffed in 14.4 that is 3 patches ago or in other terms at most 2 months probably closer to a month and a half in which she's been good. Before that she was straight up terrible one of the worst champions in the game at the time and no people building her wrong was not the issue. She was just bad.
        You're telling me Ahri with 5% AP ratio on Q and slight HP growth in 14.4 meant Ahri was playable? I somewhat overexaggerated but she was being played a lot in pro too.
            10% since her q has two dmg instances also she got an old e-CD nerf reverted on 14.2 aditionally it probably also helped that riot buffed malignance by 5AH in 14.4 and made it cheaper in 14.3.     
The cumulative amounts of buffs she and her items needed is honestly a testament to how shit they were.
                At the same time, Stormsurge also got nerfed 3 patches in a row from 14.1 hot fix to 14.3. This is also probably a reason as her matchups changed.
Yup. Rito Special is looking at a problem, then dealing with the symptoms rather than fixing the cause.
That's because Riot's balance team makes changes that only the mentally insane would make because it causes chaos and makes a lot of champions more fun to play, but miserable to play against.
And eventually come out with a Learnings Dev Article about how their lack of oversight on Malignance led to the current State of Balance. They'll be sorry and ensure thorough communication in the years to come. Thanks for sticking by Riot throughout all these years. In compensation, here's a Ward skin for your loyalty.
I think it would be okayish for it to be a mana item if the other ones weren't this bad. Ludens is so bad everyone gets seraphs instead and seraphs rush is complete ass on half the mage roster because it does basically nothing until it's upgraded and even then it deals no damage
    So true. Ludens honestly is the worst feeling item in the game. No pen on it, so you're just fully relying on the proc damage, but then you can't clear waves for 15 seconds in order to use it.

Awful item. Tbh stormbringer could've been reworked into the ludens replacement, then it also reduces abuse by assassins
        Luden's only feels strong when it breaks spellshields like EoN or banshee's.
    tear into liandry into seraph is kinda insane on some mages though (I tried it on Vik and Taliyah currently)
This has been my biggest complaint of the AP item changes. We went from 4 total Lost Chapter items to three, with one of them (Malignance) being incredibly champ-specific. If you're playing Taliyah, Syndra, Hwei, Viktor, Ryze, Zoe, and some more you are never building Malignance - and half of these champs can't even proc the passive.
    I am not saying it is good, but why technically not on Syndra, Hwei or Viktor? On Syndra you use your ult for poke in lane quite a bit thus having it more often and having the 3/4 balls after the first one do more dmg throught hte pen doesnt seem so bad. On Hwei, if you hit ult, you would use the pen for the explosion and the severing bolt no? And Viktor uses ult for waveclear/poke so having it more often would also help a bit no? Maybe I am wrong in my assumptions or my view on these champs is skewed by proplay (mainly Viktor, maybe Syndra) but I would rather build this than Luden and in some cases than Seraphs.

On the other hand, Ryze especially doesn't really mind no? He builded Seraph anyways and you still have Rod of ages that you don't really want to build on many champs other than him.

But I agree that overall the change feels quite bad since Liandrys doesn't give mana anymore and it was one of the most useful items for mages.
        Size of Malignance field scales with damage per hit. Multi-hit ultimates do very little damage and thus make a tiny field for the shred
            While this makes sense and would make them less usefull, Syndra's ult hits quite fast so I think most of it would still hit in the tiny field (at least on the edge of the field from each orb). But I may be wrong in that regard
                The orbs would all benefit from the bonus but you’d end up losing a lot of the AOE value from it. They’d take maybe 50(?) damage from Malignance puddle and the rest of your combo with Ult-start likely wouldn’t benefit from it.
                    Maybe I played her wrong for the most part, but I usually ended the combo/skrimish with ult, but regardless, you are right that it wouldnt give enough value and certainly not for other skills. I wasnt saying that Malignance was significantly good on Syndra as I havent played her much since the changes and didnt look at the statistics, was just proposing that it is not as unusable as the original comment said.
        Syndra could be one of the better users out of the list, but I generally believe Malignance is still her weakest LC item out of the three. Archangels gives defense through the shield and safe scaling, where as Luden's offers an aggressive build path with Alternator in it and has a better damaging passive.

Hwei - I think Malignance is just really bad on him. With the way the item works he always gets an absolutely tiny Malignance puddle and by the time the slow has ramped up (for the QW follow up) they're long out of it.

Viktor -I don't know, it might be decent on him actually.
        Malignance isn't *terrible* on Hwei, but Hwei doesn't really depend on his ult as much as other champions. So he doesn't get as much use out of the effect or the CDR.
I think its a mana item because it would be very broken on Vlad and Kennen

It's kinda like a limiter in a sense
    It's broken on everyone who can use it th

Like who'd have thought having your ult up on images would be strong
    Might be pretty scary on Rumble too.
Liandry should never have been made into a mana item. Giving all mages such consistent and standard access to % hp magic damage dot as their standard item buy was one of the biggest issues with top lane meta (and to a lesser extent jungle). The game just had so much % hp damage (along with stuff like divine sunderer) that it destroyed the tanks (which is why they had to keep buffing tank damage, because they melted to everything)
    Mages were not tank shredding anyone, it was Divine Sunderer and Bork which invalidated tanks in toplane. Especially Sunderer which caused the issue you were mentioning. And now with the MR items we have, no mage (not AP bruisers) is shredding any tank or bruiser if people are being honest with themselves.

Toplane was and is still dominated by bruisers who are basically almost as tanky whilst dealing almost the same dmg as an ADC.
        >Toplane was and is still dominated by bruisers who are basically almost as tanky whilst dealing almost the same dmg as an ADC.

fuck bruisers like garen darius etc but still adc have way more range which is most important stat at 4+ items
        As a top main, yes, 100% this. Shen main, Shenpaiislife, and having hardswapped sunfire cape on shen for divine sunderer & titanic the moment the items dropped, I can say with absolute certainty they were a MASSIVE power spike, even before heartsteel abuse was a thing, on any tank or bruiser.
            It's mind-boggling how long it took for them to nerf Sunderer and even this new iteration of Sunderer is only being properly nerfed now in pbe despite it being so centralising.
                Yep, i dont play on pc anymore, but every support I play on wildrift builds titanic hydra & sunderer. If I played PC, I'd absolutely build sunderer on bard too it's just THAT good. Granted, I played bard as a tank, not an enchanter or "mage"
                    Doesn't really work on PC, supports just don't really have the gold to get both titanic and sundered in a reasonable time frame. Supports usually sit on support item +1 completed item for awhile unless they snowball hard. This is especially the case for bruiser items as they tend to be pricier than support items by a significant margin (3300/3100 for titanic/sundered)
                        Well.. top laners sit on two completed items for a while unless they snowball, too. Should they stop building bruisers' items, too? Jugglers sit on completed jungle item +1 completed item for a while as well. Should they stop building bruisers' items, too? Yes, it'll take longer to complete them. But if you're paying attention to the game state and your gold gain consistency across matches, you can easily adjust your playstyle and build order to better accommodate varying factors in the gold "deficit" that supports apparently have
                            Top laners still consistently are getting gold to build more items. If supports and top laners build the same items, top laners will be building them significantly faster. (also many bruiser items scale well with base stats/champ level, which top laners will have more of).

Bruiser items frankly aren't that amazing when you are behind in items, but are really strong when you are ahead compared to any other class.

Theres also a big difference between titanic + sundered compared to like solstice sleigh + sundered.

There's a reason there are 0 supports right now that build bruiser items outside of camille (who isn't doing so hot since nerfs to bloodsong). And camille is mostly there because she abuses bloodsong harder than any other champ (best sheen user in the game)
        I wouldn't call it tank shredding or that Liandry's was the main issue. However it definitely did contribute since pretty much every role in the game did significant damage to tank champions. While this was exacerbated by a lack of good MR items (outside of maybe FoN), and particularly no mr items you could build first, it didn't matter what role was attacking the tank, tanks just weren't tanky.

The issue with most mages right now is that luden's is kinda bad, and many of them feel much worse with the significant decrease in AH on mage builds.
            except that for the ones who can build them current liandry + riftbaker are far worse than old liandry (+ demonic)

the only difference is that the mages who actually struggle against tanks have no option left
                Classically, tanks are supposed to counter mages for the most part. It was part of the reason the adc role existed was to kill tanks.

And idk, as much as gwen/morde is a pain to deal with as tanks, that is also heavily because of their kit (and I'd still rather play against them than play tanks on mythic item patches)
                    liandry mostly helped to deal with bruisers,tanks stacking MR never really suffered from it

and while I agree on what you said there is a difference between being countered and having an hopeless matchup,liandry ensured it was only the latter

point is liandry was never problematic on the champion you are afraid would become too strong against tanks with it
                        I disagree that liandries is decent into bruisers or tanks for that matter. I think wed see alot more mages top and mages splitpushing into enemy toplaners if it was. But we dont cause mages dont have the initial burst to kill through bruiser items and dont have the mobility to survive extended fights where liandries would see value.
                        To an extent yes, however during mythic items, there wasn't much MR for tanks to build. Most of the MR items gave like 40 MR, and none of them were first items (only jak'sho had MR for first tank item). It's why rumble, despite getting much better liandry's and more anti-tank damage in his kit is largely performing much worse into tanks this season relatively.

As a tank player at least, it is far less painful to play into magic damage now, and you are drastically tankier (unless it's like brand/lillia/asol or some other %hp magic damage champ that also build liandrys)
On a scale of 1 to "Didnt she just fucking ult?" i rate champs like Lissandra the latter
I might be crazy but nah, zed and yasuo might be more frustrating to fight or lane against but ahri is way more efficient at actually winning games and yoinking lp
    People on reddit would rather lose lp to champs like Ahri and Janna than get solokilled by Zed or Yone
    I think Ahri is just a much harder champ to read. I always find it pretty easy to track how an Yas or Zed is going to play a fight, but Ahri just has so many more options
    I find ahri more frustrating to play against personally, she becomes literally unkillable post 6.
        Not me managing to have negative KDA on ahri.
i'd rather have ahri or yas against me yeh

its a good food
    says the vex fizz player lol
that's because you don't know how to play vs them and haven't faced a good ahri
    I don't think you even need to face a good Ahri when she just kills you by existing as a squishy with W R and Lichbane after horribly missing Q and E
    Or maybe due to personal preference / depending on your pool because I could tell you exactly the same about ahri to you
        not really you're just playing in low elo, where ahri isn't anything special

Ahri is for sure way more frustrating to play against than Zed btw
    That’s entirely subjective
        Yes, it's subjective and it comes down to personal opinion. That being said, a lot more people find Zed more frustrating than Ahri. Zed is specifically left weak precisely because Riot knows most of the playerbase hates playing against it
            I wonder if riot plans to change zed’s kit?
this serves as a balance lever. There are basically two groups which would in theory like this item:
"I have an impactful ultimate and want to use it basically off-cd to make a play" like malzahar, karthus, fidfle sticks.
or "I have a low cd ult already and can make use of the bonus magic reduction fields whenever I use my ult" such as anivia or swain. I know malignance is not the most purchased item on these champions, most of the time because of spike issues or there simply being a better lost chapter item available - however, if riot would want to buff the item, they could specify for which group they wish to buff it instead of making it to strong for one group. they could let it give more ultimate haste (karthus or fiddlesticks would benefit more) or let the magic fields be more impactful (better for anivia or teemo as they do not care as much about the ultimate haste.)
    Well, actually just cause the CD is already low doesnt mean the Haste isnt still great for the champs. Especially Kassadin is pretty happy to have less time between ults
this is such a bad take. The active effect is literally irrelevant. The ultimate haste is why the item is disgusting on some champions.
It does have a cooldown tho.
    Right. 3 second per target just looked it up. TIL
imo item feels turbo shit on malz, i only build it as a 3rd item
>10 percent points

I love you for this
Like J4, who took 8 patches at sub48% wr to get a partial revert to nerfs that happened because goredrinker and old shojin were giga buffed
    yea. my personal favorite example is sivir though. every second line in all of her 5 abilitys are the result of some item interaction they wanted to get rid off,  resulting in her being incredibly volatile and having complealty unique interactions with 0 mentions in the tooltips.
It should be removed or nerfed. I was playing Azir yesterday and my ult CD was 30 seconds with Malignance, Ultimate Hunter, and almost no other CDR.
Why do people think this? The active is legit garbage. The item is completely carried by giving 45 ability haste total to champions reliant on their ult cd.
At the very least it needs to be adjusted accordingly. Right now the only limiting factor for these low cd ults is that the radius is smaller on the burn area created by it. The damage is still the same, and being able to get multiple procs of it within a fight is insane. Give the "hatefog" a cooldown of 10 seconds so it doesn't proc more than 2 times in a fight, no matter which champion you're playing.
Maglinance isn’t gameplay defining but amplifying.

That’s the difference. Champs that like to ult buy malignance to ult more often and have it be stronger.

Champs that bought gore suddenly became drain tanks even though they weren’t.
    Sure but what about Stridebreaker? It didn't quite change gameplay all that much, simply allowed champs who like to chase people have an easier time doing it. I would say even Goredrinker didn't change gameplay all that much. Yes, it allowed certain fighters to sustain more than they did before, but it's still amplification of gameplay.

There are a bunch of champs who like to ult more often, want it to be stronger, center around their ult, that can't buy Malignance or feel like it's suboptimal on them, like Malzahar.
        Stride is still in the game.

Old Stride got removed because it removed the entire counterplay of juggernauts (being kiteable) by giving them an on-demand dash.
            Sure, but it is in a state considerably weakened. And I don't think Stride removed the counterplay in the way you mean unless you are talking about the time when it had that dash, which point I'd agree totally.

I don't think Gore defines gameplay to a lesser extent than nerfed Stride or Malignance does if the former were to be nerfed in the manner items like Stride or Liandry were to.
                I have no idea what you’re talking about.

Stride rewards champs that want to stay close to you by slowing you, making it harder to get away - before this state, it gave you a dash which was broken and had to be removed.

I don’t understand what you mean with „weakend state“ it’s exactly the same as last seasons stride.

Gore defined your gameplay. You became a drain tank when you bought it, even though you weren’t supposed to be one. It changed your gameplay like old stride or galeforce by giving you tools that you weren’t supposed to have.

Malignance only makes your ult stronger just like Rabadons makes your abilities stronger. Everyone who likes to ult buys that item. Even malzahar, even though you named him in champs that don’t want to buy it (no idea why, it’s his most purchased item)

Liandries is supposed to be an anti tank item that also compliments champs that have dps in their kit.
                    Agreein with you here, just clarifying


Stride helps you stick to people, not aproach people. It is there so that once you get close to someone, they cant get away. It doesnt help you get in if your champ can't do it already.

Something like gore made champs who couldnt normally sustain on longer fights be able to. Sundered sky does the same now too. They patch a weakness instead of amplifying your strenght
                        Yea this
                    > I don’t understand what you mean with „weakend state“ it’s exactly the same as last seasons stride.

No? It's slow is weaker considerably compared to it's mythic version, to the point where they had to go around and buff champs like Garen and Darius who used it who were now in the dumpster. It used to deal 175% total AD with a 40% slow for 3 seconds, not it deals %80 AD with a 35% slow that decays over 3 seconds, on top of having overall lower stats and not having haste anymore. 

> Gore defined your gameplay. You became a drain tank when you bought it, even though you weren’t supposed to be one. It changed your gameplay like old stride or galeforce by giving you tools that you weren’t supposed to have. 

Not really. Most of the champs who bought it were those who wanted to slug around in middle of the fight, those with both innate sustain or other means of surviving in the fight. It didn't change the fundamental gameplay of any champion outside of the situations where it was so strong that it could have the gameplay defining effect you describe, but those situations were short and were taken care of by Riot quickly.

> Even malzahar, even though you named him in champs that don’t want to buy it (no idea why, it’s his most purchased item)

He buys it, but he doesn't want to. Right now the optimal build, in terms of damage and utility, is manaless build of Liandry into Rylai into whatever, but because Malz cannot go manaless like Swain, Brand, etc. can, he HAS to buy Malignance. This is why Malz is much weaker this season compared to previous one, why his winrate fell by 2 percent, and why a Rioter came to Malz mains discord and asked his mains their opinions about changes they would make.

> Liandries is supposed to be an anti tank item that also compliments champs that have dps in their kit. 

Okay? That's not my point. My point is that I don't believe Gore would be that egregious if it's passive was nerfed considerably in the same way Stride and Liandry were nerfed to get in line as a legendary item.
The difference is that activating malignance is very much about your champion kit. Swain with malignance doesn't feel like Ahri with malignance.

They still need to do something about repeat triggers though. Annie tibbers triggering it again on every tick of the burn is ridiculous.

None of the other mana AP items feel remotely exciting so I don't mind them trying something different to fix that.
    Sure but you'd think a champ like Swain who can constantly amply the pools through his ult would love this, but because his use with the MPen portion is limited and he doesn't get that much mileage out of the Ulti Haste, so it remains a bit suboptimal. 

I agree that other AP mana items are just really unsatisfying. Again, mage mythics were pretty much okay, especially in their diversity, so I'm really not sure why Riot just ditched that and gave us a bunch of mana items that are mostly unsatisfying outside of Malignance, which is locked to certain champs.
        Yeah the biggest issue with the item is that it can't decide if it's a DoT item or a Mpen item. The truth is that it's an ultimate haste item.

On the other hand I don't think the mana items were particularly better last season.
            > The truth is that it's an ultimate haste item.

It's an ultimate haste item but in a really wonky way, where it's good if you can use it to either spam your spammable ult more or if you can be like Ahri and abuse the ulti haste in a way where your ult can have almost no cooldown at all at later levels. 

I thought mage mythics were decent last season, and I definitely enjoyed the aspect of almost every mage having at least 3 different mythic options they could switch around to decent enough satisfaction depending on the situation. It was certainly better than our current situation of having to choose between different types of meh.

This is absolutely not my experience. Ludens by default is what I remember.
                    Nah there were plenty of Liandry users (Viktor this season for instance is feeling shitty due to the loss of liandry mythic) or crown users. Lots of ROA users too (anivia, ryze, swain depending on game etc). As lux there were plenty of games where it was good to go either ludens or liandry
                        Liandry users picked their Liandry and never looked at other items. Same with RoA users. If you weren't one of those, it was Ludens and you weren't excited about it. So Ludens by default.
                            > Liandry users picked their Liandry and never looked at other items.

Swain could and would go Luden's into certain teams regularly. Similarly Cass could easily go Liandry into certain teams.
                                Swain could and would go liandries, ludens, and ROA lol.
                            "ludens by default except for all the mages who didn't use Ludens which was probably more than half"
                                Well yes, that's the concept of default. If you had anything especially synergistic with your kit you'd pick that and you'd end up with Ludens if you didn't, which felt back. The new situation is exactly the same thing but with Malignance as one of the synergy options. They didn't solve anything for the champs that unhappily ended up buying Ludens but they also didn't make anything worse either. The situation being your kit picking the mana item for you or having to pick an unexciting one was already there.
                            ? I don't know what elo you're in but there were a huge number of mages who could swap between Luden's and Liandry's last season, and you didn't need to have a special synergy to want Liandry's either. It was a common choice even on champions like Syndra, who made a decision between that and Luden's based on how squishy the enemy comp was and how much they needed the haste in a particular game.

The number of mages who were hard-locked into Luden's by lack of other options was extremely small. Almost every mage could opt into Liandry's if they felt like it.
                            Syndra could go both
                    My experience was that, which maybe skewed because I play these tanky battlemages like Swain, Vlad, Cass etc was that a lot of popular mages like Ori, Syndra, Viktor, Xerath etc. could opt for Liandry if there were enough health stackers because they got really good mileage out of the damage amp from bonus health, which at times could give up to 10 percent bonus damage on all damage. I would also regularly see some of them take Crown if the situation permitted it.
i saw sloppywalrus video yesterday he bought it just for the CDR it gives but its unusable on his r because of the knock back which kinda funny
    Which champ?
        Gragas, Sloppywalrus is a Grag 1trick streamer.

How is build diversity ever going to exist when you can easily track winrates on item builds? Its not a solvable problem
    Its probably when you have multiple items with similar winrates. Or just have items for the game's niche.

Like, bruisers like Noc get to chose between bruiser items and tank items based on each game. Assassins to a devree get to choose between all the lethality items and some bruiser items

Mages don't have that many options or niche items, their builds get very cookie cutter and boring
    I think it's a problem you can alleviate.

The problem is that a lot of items aren't designed to be per-game situational - they're designed to be per-champion situational. Like surface level both Liandry's and Nashor's are sustained damage AP items with one being better vs tanks and the other being better vs squishies, but in practice they aren't substitutes at all. And speaking of Nashor's, it's problematic in that it's an item useless to the vast majority of the champions it's supposedly in the item class for (mages) and core on the couple that actually buy it. OTOH you have items like Morello's and Banshee's that very much are per-game situational buys, but because of those core items, you usually have to delay them, can only get one or two, and there frankly just aren't many of them.

For mages specifically, that problem is often compounded by the fact that all AP bruisers, assassins, and sustained damage dealers have to share a single item pool. The bruisers tend to be able to dip into some of the tank items for a couple slots, but their other items are still taking up space in the mage pool. Going back to the Nashor's example, it's the only attack speed item for AP champions which makes it a waste of an item pool slot for most mages, but it needs to exist for champions like Azir and Gwen that build AP and need attack speed - the result is an item a few champions really want with no alternative for it.

Mana items are also a point of issue for mages in that there aren't very many of them. Sure, there being 4 looks kind of good, but again, those have to cover multiple different sub-classes of AP champion. The result tends to be that there isn't great diversity there because those 4 options have to cover so much ground and get designed to cover a specific archetype, and since the champions that need a mana item typically really need to get it first, that bottleneck is the first thing you see every single game. AD champions get around this by simply not needing mana items most of the time, though the options for those that do are fairly lacking as well.

None of this is helped by items like DCap that are just turbo generic powerful stat slots with no alternatives.
    More impactful active items could be a step at least, less skilled players will immediately avoid them. Think things like old prowlers claw, or maybe a targeted zhonyas, or blade mail from dota. Not saying this won't get figured out, but at least we'll have more options to play with
        people want to play the champs, not the items unfortunately which is why stuff like Galeforce and Prowlers won't come back. They talked about it when they removed Prowlers from the mythics IIRC.
Yep. Lack of any real non "meta" builds had been the biggest contributing factor to my stopping playing on PC. I don't want to build the exact same items every single game. It's boring. It's like playing an rpg the exact same way every time you play through it. Builds should be fairly fluid from game to game, adjusting for each individual game as it unfolds. Instead, it's turned into "buy these items in this order, don't even look at other items or you're griefing"
If you were excited about item changes then you aren't familiar with riots history of item changes. This is what happens every single time. It's not about balance, It's about shaking up the meta to make their pro leagues more interesting to watch. They do this all the time with pretty much every "big balance pass".

They're not stupid, they most definitely knew about malignance before anyone else did. They've been doing this for 14 years. As long as the meta is just different that's all they care about, not balance. Same reason they change the jungle every single year and It's the same reason they change objectives/masteries/runes.
Meanwhile ludens doesn't do anything in a fight because you had the audacity to kill a minion. 
I mean it is a pretty cool item
they build it because it's OP not because they use well,Ahri specifically only builds it as a stat stick the actual burn never does anything due her kit

and in this case it would be more like out of 10 users 9 became overpowered and 1 is doing ok with it

edit: by the way before the item was overbuffed malignace was the lowest winrate starting item on Ahri
    If they can make use of all the stats, then they build it because they use it well. Not making a comment on the items balance, simply pointing out that stats are just a valid reason to get an item, debabtely more than the unique effect.
        the stats are good but the item effect is horrible on Ahri that's exactly what I'm saying

the pool from her ult will be very small and she has no way to keep people inside so she pretty much only makes uses of the stats with the passive being as good as inexistent,yet it's still better than say ludens which has both good stats and an useful effect

she doesn't make full use of the item and it's still the best option,don't you see the problem?
            I understand what you are saying, but I disagree the effect is horrible on her. Unless I am misunderstanding an interaction here, her ult gets like 3 charges. Each charge fires a few bolts to nearby enemies. If she times her ult and is in a perfect scenario she can proc the pools 9 individual times. That's extra damage for free, as well as MR reduction for anyone in the pools. If she dashed in, landed a charm on you, you are now in a damage circle, with reduced MR against a decently strong burst. 

She may not be constantly procing the pool like Kassadin would, but she still can very easily benefit from the passive, along with the stats. 

Once again, I don't play Ahri, so if her ult doesn't actually proc the passive for someone reason, that's my bad.
                the 3 sec CD usually means she procs it twice at best (even only once per target if she doesn't space a lot between ults,it takes 2 seconds to use all casts for reference),what you're describing is an extremely unlikely scenario

her E makes them walk out of the pool already on its own + you usually either use it before or significantly after proccing malognace

it's not too unusual to get 60 damage or so per solo fight unless they're a sitting duck

it really sounds good on paper but in practice this item is awful on her,besides the broken stats
No they do not. It’s been same since the release of the game.
i like this
Nah. It would be actually a decent change, so they don’t do it.
Bork is tuned down, it might be an issue on Irelia but not sure, barely see that champ. What does on hit bullshit mean? On hit by design has a very linear power curve and is just good from 1st to 6th item but it does not have a ceiling as high as crit.

It seems to me like Malignance is breaking champions and making certain ones borderline broken while champs that cant benefit are left a bit in the dust since it offers insanely good stats for mages.
What's this Reddit obsession with Botrk ffs, the item is far from broken, unlike malignance. Just get good
    It’s not that it’s broken, it just takes up so much of the power budget on champs that use it (look at Irelia)
not at all it's just a coincidence

she liked everfrost because her E is actually really hard to hit and pretty important for her kit 

she likes malignace for the insane ult haste you can stack with it which she relies on to make plays
    literally look at her most common builds

it is just a collection of the most gold efficient items she can afford with whatever income she gets, with rabadon's as a cherry if she's doing well. she takes absolutely no consideration as to whether an item fits well into her kit or not. vegan ahri exists in both proplay and soloqueue and is completely viable for a reason. the champion is the problem


nerfing malignance will do nothing
        her best build is malignace lich bane,then rabadons/banshee/void staff or bloom which all seems pretty normal in terms of cost,if you were right we'd see items like Shurelya,Rylai or other pure utility items,instead she always goes for damage/CDR stacking

then again you talk as if literally every single champion in the game doesn't benefit from gold efficiency and tends to build the items that give you the most
            My fault, I should have clarified gold efficient *mage* items, I did in another thread about Ahri but forgot to say it in this comment.


Items like Rabadon's and Lich Bane (or its 2nd damage item equivalent on other champions) are always going to be the highest winrate items, but the very context of their purchase is those champions being ahead enough in the game to justify the purchase to begin with. Items like Rabadon's get picked lower and lower the higher elo you go (but the win rate also goes up, because when you're ahead enough to purchase a high elo player utilizes the spike better) regardless of whatever mage you're playing because the cost is simply not as justifiable in a standard build because of how it slows down your item spikes.

The problem with Ahri is that she can freely opt into low damage builds while simultaneously being able to capitalize on more damage oriented purchases if the game state allows it. Champions like Viktor and Syndra are stuck in a hole where they *have* to build damage because purchasing for example horizon focus 2nd even though it doesn't technically fit with their kit will butcher their usefulness in a game. Ahri can be set behind and not give a single fuck  while also being a total nightmare if she is ahead in any given game.
so... they're not giving Ahri and co the "Riot special"?
Generic ability haste exists and is possible to balance. There's nothing about ultimate haste that makes it impossible to balance. One point of ultimate haste is worth less than generic ability haste, so there's some ratio that is balanced.
Which other sources of ultimate ability haste have caused balance issues? We've had multiple others, some in the game for years.
I don't remember the last time I ever saw a teemo outside aram
    I mean, the first 4 days of this season teemo mains were everywhere. He had multiple srooms and could literally do what he was supposed to do, annoy the enemy team and provide A LOT of vision.
Still waiting for them to remove Teemo shrooms from ARAM. 
Fuck balancing it, get rid of it.
    They basically did though.

Shrooms went from 3/4/5 to a 2/3/4 max shrooms they can hold. And the time it takes to recharge them is also up through the roof.

And then i'm not even talking about that snitch of a cannon minion
        And half the damage to minions.
    L take
        L brain, if any.
            Ight I'll entertain you, what exactly bothers you/ do you think is wrong with teemo shrooms in aram?
                No pink wards or oracles anymore. You can't do anything but wait for a cannon minion to come by, which means it's impossible to push even after an ace and it slows the game down a ton. Same issue with shaco.
                    Nah the longer the game goes on the more cannons spawn and if you get the inhib teemo becomes considerably weaker than before.
                    That's a pretty gross exaggeration of shacos capabilities. Boxes die in 1 auto/ability and aren't able to 1 shot a wave. They also don't stay on map for very long and most a wave will hit 2 or 3. Boxes won't be able to stop a push. As for teems shrooms, what else does teemo do in aram? He blinds and throws shrooms. He doesn't have the same aeo dmg as other mages. He has far less range than other mages and marksmen. He is very squishy, has no cc other than blind. I think it's OK if he kills a wave after he dies.
                        Shaco also has a box limit of 6 in aram iirc. Still obnoxious playing against him as a melee/tank since its impossible to engage him without cannon wave but not OP imo
                        Sure, Shaco's not as bad and teemo is relatively easy to kill. You asked why people thought teemo wasn't fun to play against in aram, that's why. It's not about winrate, it's that the specific mechanics he relies on aren't fun to play against, at least for me.
                            I think teemos shrooms are actually fun to play against. It's something different that you have to pay attention to. Like a mini game. Plus, should teemo be removed from a specific game mode just because they think it's unfun? Seems like a silly take imo.
                    There are infinity cannons in aram…
                The optimal way to use them has become spamming them down the middle of lane where minions come. If your team is pushing, the enemies die if they chase past their own minions at all. If youre being pushed in, it just becomes a game of can the mushrooms stall long enough to get you back in. Either way theyre unfun for all players but the teemo, and even then its not fun putting 90% of them in one place, and thats on an ultimate ability, which are supposed to be the most exciting abilities to use.
                Local man can’t resist the allure of bushes or walking ahead of minions.
    Cannons and super minions reveal them. Teemo shrooms are quite weak in ARAM at this point. I've reached the point of building to make his Q and autos more useful than focusing on the shrooms at this point.
    They deal like 0 dmg to minions, are easy to clear every other wave... like idk
        ..0 damage to minions? It still does enough to wreck waves even after the nerf
            2-3 shrooms for melees isn't really wrecking and certainly not effective or efficient. 
        They literally wreck every wave, even if they are seen they still explode on the melee minions. And he can throw them in real time + bounce making them impossible to clear unless you have at least 3 range (still alive and in range to clear them as he drops them).
But I guess if your have the MMR of a clown and you play your ARAM with iron players this probably is not an issue for you. 

Every game against a Teemo is a nightmare to end. You can disagree, but that'd just show how clueless you are. Get rid of them or bring back the oracle elixir.
            > You can disagree, but that'd just show how clueless you are.

Yikes. In all honesty, I fully agree with your overall point about teemo in ARAM, but that's such a shitty attitude to have lol.

"If you disagree with me, it must be because you're stupid. I'm not going to listen to anyone who says anything else!" 

Get it together, bud.
                I would not mind arguing in good faith, but wtf is that :
"They deal like 0 dmg to minions, are easy to clear every other wave... like idk"

Either it's sarcasm, in which case he's missing the /s, either it's not worth talking about/with.

If I told you "Teemo is bad in ARAM because people don't use their ult", you'd be a fool to argue with me. It's pointless and fruitless.

Also, the league of legends subreddit is the last place on the internet I'd think of arguing on, regardless of what you actually say and how well you argue/document your point. People who disagree philosophically will not bother to read/educate themselves and will downvote into oblivion regardless.
            Factually untrue. 2-3 shrooms for melees isn't really wrecking and certainly not effective or efficient. Just shows you don't play the game.
            [49% W/R](https://lolalytics.com/lol/teemo/aram/build/?tier=all). The only rank where he is above 50% is iron, and his W/R falls as rank increases. If you can't win vs teemo on aram then that's on you bro.
    Kiddo Aram Player, be quiet
I wouldn’t mind seeing her as long as it’s without Ma’ligma’s insane damage. 

At first, in previous seasons, I used to think thought her RQ was OP in most lanes, but I had found out her scalings were trash which forced her to tech into utility or indirect damage sources. I found that pretty cool with how she could leverage one strength into another later on

Now I see her going full AP Ma’ligma and it feels AHHHHHH with how she is such a one trick pony now, it feels cheap to play against
    I think it is exactly the same problem ap shyv has. 

When your whole shtick is basicly undodgeable atomic bombs (dragonform E and RQ respectivly) its supremly stupid to play against.
        >basically undodgeable atomic bombs

RQ may be hard to dodge, but it’s easy to avoid. Karma has absolutely no backline access, so if you just position properly she will never damage you.
            Thats 100% true and 100% irrelevant at the same time depending on what Champion you play. Good luck avoiding a midlane karma hugging her ADC as melee midlaner
                Sure, but there’s plenty of other champs that shit on melee mid laners too. The fact that you get counterpicked sometimes does not make a champion OP.
                    I did not say with one word that i think she is OP. I only said that she is absolutly atrocious to play against in mid and she should kindly piss off to botlane. I stand by that still 🤐
        People always discredit how much damage Shyvanas ult deals in AP builds

Landing onto squishies with your fly in, is absolutely a core part of her damage. Not just her breath from a distance
            It really depends on what you need to be doing at the current moment. AP Shyv has the ability to seriously chunk and sometimes oneshot enemies from afar, in some situations you're getting more damage from ulting backward because you'll be alive long enough to deal more damage. I can think of a couple champs I'm just not ulting onto as glass cannon AP Shyv.
            Just played with AP Shyv on ARAM that seemed to rely solely on the R damage. She jumped in, almost always landed just on Poppy and Pantheon, promptly died (who would have guessed) and started blaming everyone for not following up.
        Karma had an added bonus of also being really fast and healing and shielding a shit ton, which only adds to the frustration of playing against her
        Karma is on a hard timer tho compared to Shyv.
        Bronze level take
MFs when a champ designed to be a midlane mage is playable as a midlane mage and not just a shit support. Same MFs when support play a midlane mage instead of enchanter/tank: reeeeee
    Totally agreed.
    If you start using punctuation in your sentences that would help. I damn near had a stroke Reading that and am still not sure i got your meaning
        Not my problem if you cant understand English. Both of my sentences are gramatically correct, I havent skipped any necessary stuff. Also not my fault english is too basic and lacks real punctation, which many more complex languages have.
            Ah Look. You are indeed able to form coherent sentences! Congratulation!

*edit also your whole Point is somehow extrapolating my opinion on whole classes of champions from my opinion on one (1) support being absolutly stupid to play against in mid. 

Interesting take to say the least.
                And you are able to read, congrats!

Karma was literally designed to be a midlaner but was pushed out of it like most other mages (zilean, velkoz, brand, zyra). And people always cry that people play mages as supports then people cry when people play mages in their original role. What if people would stop crying if a mage is able to play the game and also carry and not just be a wave clearing slave?
                    You are making the biggest strawman Argument ive Seen in a while here. I have Not Said a single word about any mage support other than karma and not a single thing about another midlaner than karma. 

Since you cant stop putting words in my mouth i will just stop responding now. Maybe Go argue with the persons that allegedly hold the opinions you are arguing against, not with someone that has not said a single word of the above.
She never belonged bot anyway... She and Seraphine were supposed to be supportive utility midlane mages, not shield/heal bots with mediocre everything else.
    Please, they sealed Seraphine's fate when so many parts of her kit got bonuses off of interacting with allies. They should have known that Passive, W, and R being strictly better with allies nearby would push her into support.
Maybe use her RE more, because it got gigabuffed.
    I just want to RQ one shot people. RE is a waste of R as it doesn't reset the timer.
        Yep, that explains the comment and downvotes. I got into a platinum 4 peaker debate. That’s awkward.
            Rude
Not sure if I’d call 48% winrate on 3 roles „outright unplayable“
honestly the CDR makes kassadin activate at lv 11 instead of 16 so it's kinda big too.
    Maybe they should make the ult CD scale with lvl like they do with the lethality slow item
        Serlyda does not scale wtih level, it scales with how much letgality you have
            then maybe make ult cdr scale woth how much regular cdr you have?
                That's tough because I think Ability Haste is already in low supply. Could be wrong, but I see that potentially warping builds around it. It either warps builds or it gets forgotten about.
                    It's not in low supply, it's just not on any of the big utility or burst items that make the big numbers happen or stop an enemy's big numbers from happening (BV, Zhonya's, Shadowflame, Stormsurge, Void, and Deathcap).

AA/Seraph's, Malignance, Cosmic Drive, and Luden's all give 25 normal haste. 4 items for 50% CDR is very good if spell slinging is your character's thing. That's a LOT of mana, too. Cryptbloom and Horizon Focus are also really good haste items.
                        And out of 3 of those items, you're only building 1 because there's no need for multiple mana items unless you're Ryze
                            You're trading raw damage for cooldowns. No one ever asked if building raw CDR was going to be the optimal choice or whether some stats are wasted. That's irrelevant here. The point is there is a ton of haste available if you want to go that route, and Seraph's makes sure the mana doesn't go completely to waste with a bigger shield and more AP.

We're not talking about need. But it's not like a set like this is bad in and of itself.

Luden/Malignance/seraph (whichever you need/want), Cosmic Drive, Horizon, Cryptbloom, DCap, Sorcs.

That's a total of 85 haste, which is 46% CDR. I honestly don't see the problem here. That's more than was ever achievable before ability haste existed. You can bump that to 50% if you're okay with letting sorcs slide...but probably shouldn't do that.
                    Tbf, we really don’t need AH in the game atm. Cooldowns are already so low for most champs that the traditional counterplay of abusing openings is much more restricted. It’s IMO one of the poorer design philosophies Riot has picked up in the recent seasons. 

Everyone talks about the damage being the problem, but I’d prefer high damage rewarding landing skills, but being harshly punished for missing them. Doesn’t feel that way at the moment as rotations come back up pretty quickly.
                That gives it a quadratic scaling which is probably not what you want.

It would have to be balanced around builds with lots of haste, which would make it bad in all other cases.
                    idk I was just throwing shit out ngl. Maybe you could give it a RoA type of deal where ult CD goes up per a certain time period to a cap? or give it something like Axiom Arc's passive but touch the numbers a bit and just remove the ult cd altogether? idk I'm literally just spitting out whayever comes to mind lmao
                There's already not a lot of it, and unlike lethality, it gets less effective the more you have
        Maybe they should just not make stupid items like this in the first place.

Had high hopes for this season at the start once they removed mythics but Riot cannot take a single step forward without taking 2 steps back.
            The second they announced that shit it was so obvious it would be going down this same path. Riot makes unique item that is overtuned for certain characters>they nerf the character and make them reliant on said items>nerf the item to trash tier dragging the nerfed champs with it.
    But Kassadin has always activated at 11...
        People are still stuck years ago where 11 and 16 was a gigantic difference in power level. 16 is still a good spike but it's not what it was
            yup, kass comes online with items, not levels (need 11 ofc)

still u get 2,5 sec ult cd without malignance rn at 11 with some haste/Ultimate Hunter
    That's been the case for a few years now.

lvl 11 kassa is strong enough to impact the game. By 16 he should be at a winning position for the most part
Maybe it's not enough to nerf Ahri but it sure is good for the other 5 champs that got mega nerfed and are now forced to build the same item every game
    Just make it have an 8s cd already, kass getting faster ults is fine but a mr shred into qwe is a lot of bonus damage, malignance being both a utility and damage/pseudo pen item is dumb
    Yep 100%

Although i think then the item is built by only 2 champs. Malzahar and Lissandra
    I feel like Ahri's problems stem from how automatic her waveclear is.

Is there really any need to have both a Q which will oneshot the backline without any special attention (not really any specialist item rushes / AP thresholds to hit / or require dematerisaliser) *AND* a W which has a baked in execute when under 20% hp?

Its way too easy to hit perfect CS with her and that catalyses any of her other issues.
        Which is kinda weird, i remember the first times i played ahri a couple seasons ago i needed dematerializer at least on the mages, now q just insta clears them.
            Pretty sure that was the time where every midlaner went demat, so that wasn't just an ahri thing
        It’s insane you’re downvoted for this lmao, the reason she’s broken is the threshold for her to full clear a wave with Q got much lower with the AP ratio increase. You’re completely correct and it’s bizarre you have any downvotes for it
        Why is this comment downvoted lol? Ahri can just press q+w and be moving to bot/jungle already on any wave that is not cannon, that alone gives her so much pressure that allows her to do whatever she want in the map. Im sure that if ahri didn't have such a strong waveclear so early her winrate would drop even if malignance remains strong.
Yeah, malignance is mainly about the cdr not the damage
Ult haste + a good chunk of ability haste on one item is pretty crazy.
    It only costs 2700 gold too. Hexplate is 3k. Why is the mage version so much cheaper when mages are even more ult gated than bruisers?
To my knowledge one of the top ahri one tricks doesn’t even build it. He goes lich -> ludens in a lot of games.
    https://www.deeplol.gg/champions/ahri/mastery/all

idk who you are referring too but almost all of them are building malignance
        LegitKorea is who I’m referring too, I might be out of date then
    OPT or not, the overwhelming data supports Malignance > Lich Band is the most effective build for Ahri atm.
        The data is a bit skewed though, the playstyle for Malig first is different.

You likely only fight with your ult if it’s on such a short CD, whereas LB you can be aggro outside of the CD, which is arguably more difficult but could pay off better.
            Yeah  but the problem is that her fighting capabilities with malignance and ult are far superior.

Malignance gives a total of 45 AH to ult. If you get +5 from GM, 50AH translate into 33%CDR, for each 1 min of the ult, she will reduce it by 20 seconds. Consider Ahri's Ult, it's CD are 130/105/80. With malignance + gm now her ult CD is 87/70/53. She can pretty much get this before 11 mins. Now you have to deal with an ahri who can TF way more often. Outside malignance  she would need at least 2 items to achieve the same spam capability. God forbid she gets vantage in lane and she gets more items early, from lvl 11 onwards it becomes toxic getting sniped that easy. She will be able to use her ult just to kill you without i
objectives on map just because she can B, get back with more items and have her ult ON again.
            I have no idea why you’re mentioning LB to support Malignance data being off FOR AHRI which it should not be. Lolanalytics also puts put their methodology and it looks pretty solid to me. 

I have no opinion on what Malignance is like for champs that aren’t Ahri but for her the CDR on Ult gives her a cycle of 3+ dashes w/ passive damage that can proc her Lich Bane auto while she weaves in QWE.
                …..LB is LichBane shortened….. figured that would be obvious in the context of “items on Ahri”.

I’m just saying Malignance playstyle is different than Luden’s into Lich.
                    OH! My mind immediately went to LeBlanc (probably because I used to OTP her a few years back). 

Also to clarify, I was saying Malignance INTO Lich Bane not necessarily Malignance is better than Lich Bane. Even though I think both Mal into LB and Mal > LB are both best/true atm.
                        That’s definitely fair lol, I know it’s the same acronym for both, I coulda just said Lich like I did in the second response I guess :p

It’s really good on Ahri, even the damage is decent, I just tend to assume a 120AP item could outperform it in some situations, and if you’re going to take Luden’s you don’t need the extra mana > AP.
        The data supports that there is very little to no difference between Malignance and other builds. It definitely isn't even 1% over ludens or something.

It's really not at all the reason Ahri gets nerfed or w/e. People acting like Ahri is the same as Teemo is crazy.
    One tricks are not a good source for what the best builds are, many have suboptimal builds because it fits their playstyle or they're used to it.
As an Ahri player I endorse this message
It already kinda does this. The puddle size scales with damage.
    puddle size is big enough even on champs that spam ult so it isnt really a big deal
    Which is why Lux, Karma, and Corki have large pools and ults they can cast every <25 seconds, and champs like Malzahar, Ahri, and Annie have small ones with ults closer to 60 seconds.

It's not balanced by cooldown, but rather by multihit/dot vs burst.
yeah these champs are not a problem anymore, after the nerfs 👍
What's maligma?
It's actually 3 seconds CD, so Teemo shrooms (4 sec poison) proc it twice! Yayy :)
    Oh yeah I forgot to mention that it's actually a bit shorter since I remember it does proc twice lmao
Because it’s visual, ult CD is something only the user sees and gets entangled with general AH, making it less clear (invisible) to the player.
    I understand the idea that people react to what they see but it really doesn’t take much to hover the tooltip and see that fed karthus has only gotten 2k damage out of it in 30 minutes
It’s not just Ahri who uses Malignance.

Teemo, Karma also relies on Malignance as a crutch and got absolutely shafted as a result with nerfs
    what the fuck happened to my goalposts they were there a second ago
        i think you are confused grandpa the op of this said championS not arhi
        it was clearly a continuation of my original point
Ahri was getting buffs prior to the item changes because she wasn’t performing. She had mana issues in lane, she couldn’t assassinate anyone without a considerable lead, she wasn’t a good contributor to team fight damage overall, she was just in an overall weaker state. The emergence of these items has changed her to a 1 item spiking champ where she was not that since DFG.
yes but both nerfs are kinda big,one would be sufficient to bring her in line and actually if you addressed the actual problem (malignace) none would be needed

before all these buffs she was near unplayable with the item changes (before malignace became a staple),one more reason to point at the item and not at the champion's kit being the problem
Dude you are not really taking an ahri buff from a year ago for her current state right? A buff that was done because she was absolutely shit to play? The other buffs in retrospect wasnt needed if the players knew how to build her from the start
    Do buffs expire after a certain amount of time?
        No but the context for them does. Just fucking remove the ability haste from maligma
            Buffs compound regardless. I agree that Malignance is overpowered but Ahri is also overtuned right now.
    She did need them at the start of the season. We knew what to build but it wasn’t until the dmg buff where she became slightly overtuned
    the fact remains that shes power creeped her way into the number 1 blind pickable mid laner
        Ahri is not blind pickable. People keep saying that when she has straight counters Lock in Zed, Akali,Yasuo and she's in for a rough time.
            low elo ahri abuser detected, none of those are counters. and she doesnt have any real counter as she can neutralise any bad lane
                Sorry to break it to you 90% of the game is played in low elo not high elo. And the low elo is what brings in the money.
                    Yes and high elo is what is balanced around 99% of the time. So whats the point in even bringing low elo up in a balance discussion? Almost never is a change aimed for them because things like meta don't even matter down there.
                    People in low elo are humans who are capable of learning. It might take them a little longer, but they do it all the time. So if the reason something is strong or weak in low elo is lack of knowledge on the player's part, it is reasonable to ask that player to just learn.
            Ahri is very blind pickable, she’s good into zed and can control the wave easily against Akali/zed, she may struggle with yasuo but even then can still waveclear with no threat. She’s safe as hell with great waveclear and decent ways to lane into melee and ranged. Shes the definition of blind pickable
            Ahri wins or goes even in all of these matchups. Like you could not have picked worst champions to suggest as counters.
            ? not a single one of those champs give ahri a rough time.

she wins at least 51% of the time against every one of those champs if you look at the stats alone.

And just based of me playing ahri. None of those champs provide any problems in the slightest
                I agree with you but I also want to point out that a lot of these champions have less than 50% win rates because they’re mechanically intensive. So using statistics to determine what “should” happen might be a bit skewed because on average people are losing on these champs which makes ahri look better into them. (She’s still good into all of them, I just don’t love the Winrate metric)
                    well neither do I usually but if the stats are 51-55% wr in pretty much all ranks, its a safe argument to make in my book.

 I should think that the ahris and zeds in master rank at least know how their champs work, yet its still almost 55% wr to ahri
                        That’s fair! I think you’re right!
    1. Ahri was awful at the start of the season none of the items worked on her.

2. People have been going between Ludens and Malig since PBE but again both items were awful

3. Ahri could not do any damage at the start of the season, her WR kept going down as the season progressed

4. Ahri got the buffs because she can't do anything and is reliant on her team to do damage, she's an assassin imagine not being able todo damage as an assassin.
        Shes an "assassin" with amazing wave clear and self sustain in lane.

no other assassin has that in an even game state, she shouldnt do as much dmg as assassins.

The reason she is nr 1 right now is because she can do assassin shit while have an extremely safe laning phase and managing 10/cs a min AND following roams, initiating roams and pulling off side lane ganks
            She’s not even number 1. Idk where this comes froms. She’s not the number 1 midlaner and all assassins out damage her. 

Ahri has good wave clear good roam and a great mobility but that’s where it ends. 

She’s literally rank 20 on LoL Analytics. 
Ahri is just the most popular midlaner because she’s 1. Cute 2 fox girl  3. Faker
                Shes rank 3 on lol analytics

Shes nr 1 on numerous high elo tier lists.

Also youre quoting third party stat sites but you still considering yasuo, akali, zed hard counters despite them saying otherwise? nothing youre saying makes sense mate, sorry
though kassadin is getting R AP ratio nerfed by 15%.
pepermint farm remembers Ahri dangling around 48% WR before the Q buff, with Fizz and Akali Nuking tanks
Yes. And if you go back to reddit before these buffs, people were memeing that Ahri was non-existent and did 0 damage.
>Ahri probably should've been nerfed a long time ago anyway.    
   
   
Jesus the overexaggeration is strong in this one. She got buffed in 14.4 that is 3 patches ago or in other terms at most 2 months probably closer to a month and a half in which she's been good. Before that she was straight up terrible one of the worst champions in the game at the time and no people building her wrong was not the issue. She was just bad.
    You're telling me Ahri with 5% AP ratio on Q and slight HP growth in 14.4 meant Ahri was playable? I somewhat overexaggerated but she was being played a lot in pro too.
        10% since her q has two dmg instances also she got an old e-CD nerf reverted on 14.2 aditionally it probably also helped that riot buffed malignance by 5AH in 14.4 and made it cheaper in 14.3.     
The cumulative amounts of buffs she and her items needed is honestly a testament to how shit they were.
            At the same time, Stormsurge also got nerfed 3 patches in a row from 14.1 hot fix to 14.3. This is also probably a reason as her matchups changed.
So true. Ludens honestly is the worst feeling item in the game. No pen on it, so you're just fully relying on the proc damage, but then you can't clear waves for 15 seconds in order to use it.

Awful item. Tbh stormbringer could've been reworked into the ludens replacement, then it also reduces abuse by assassins
    Luden's only feels strong when it breaks spellshields like EoN or banshee's.
tear into liandry into seraph is kinda insane on some mages though (I tried it on Vik and Taliyah currently)
I am not saying it is good, but why technically not on Syndra, Hwei or Viktor? On Syndra you use your ult for poke in lane quite a bit thus having it more often and having the 3/4 balls after the first one do more dmg throught hte pen doesnt seem so bad. On Hwei, if you hit ult, you would use the pen for the explosion and the severing bolt no? And Viktor uses ult for waveclear/poke so having it more often would also help a bit no? Maybe I am wrong in my assumptions or my view on these champs is skewed by proplay (mainly Viktor, maybe Syndra) but I would rather build this than Luden and in some cases than Seraphs.

On the other hand, Ryze especially doesn't really mind no? He builded Seraph anyways and you still have Rod of ages that you don't really want to build on many champs other than him.

But I agree that overall the change feels quite bad since Liandrys doesn't give mana anymore and it was one of the most useful items for mages.
    Size of Malignance field scales with damage per hit. Multi-hit ultimates do very little damage and thus make a tiny field for the shred
        While this makes sense and would make them less usefull, Syndra's ult hits quite fast so I think most of it would still hit in the tiny field (at least on the edge of the field from each orb). But I may be wrong in that regard
            The orbs would all benefit from the bonus but you’d end up losing a lot of the AOE value from it. They’d take maybe 50(?) damage from Malignance puddle and the rest of your combo with Ult-start likely wouldn’t benefit from it.
                Maybe I played her wrong for the most part, but I usually ended the combo/skrimish with ult, but regardless, you are right that it wouldnt give enough value and certainly not for other skills. I wasnt saying that Malignance was significantly good on Syndra as I havent played her much since the changes and didnt look at the statistics, was just proposing that it is not as unusable as the original comment said.
    Syndra could be one of the better users out of the list, but I generally believe Malignance is still her weakest LC item out of the three. Archangels gives defense through the shield and safe scaling, where as Luden's offers an aggressive build path with Alternator in it and has a better damaging passive.

Hwei - I think Malignance is just really bad on him. With the way the item works he always gets an absolutely tiny Malignance puddle and by the time the slow has ramped up (for the QW follow up) they're long out of it.

Viktor -I don't know, it might be decent on him actually.
    Malignance isn't *terrible* on Hwei, but Hwei doesn't really depend on his ult as much as other champions. So he doesn't get as much use out of the effect or the CDR.
It's broken on everyone who can use it th

Like who'd have thought having your ult up on images would be strong
Might be pretty scary on Rumble too.
Mages were not tank shredding anyone, it was Divine Sunderer and Bork which invalidated tanks in toplane. Especially Sunderer which caused the issue you were mentioning. And now with the MR items we have, no mage (not AP bruisers) is shredding any tank or bruiser if people are being honest with themselves.

Toplane was and is still dominated by bruisers who are basically almost as tanky whilst dealing almost the same dmg as an ADC.
    >Toplane was and is still dominated by bruisers who are basically almost as tanky whilst dealing almost the same dmg as an ADC.

fuck bruisers like garen darius etc but still adc have way more range which is most important stat at 4+ items
    As a top main, yes, 100% this. Shen main, Shenpaiislife, and having hardswapped sunfire cape on shen for divine sunderer & titanic the moment the items dropped, I can say with absolute certainty they were a MASSIVE power spike, even before heartsteel abuse was a thing, on any tank or bruiser.
        It's mind-boggling how long it took for them to nerf Sunderer and even this new iteration of Sunderer is only being properly nerfed now in pbe despite it being so centralising.
            Yep, i dont play on pc anymore, but every support I play on wildrift builds titanic hydra & sunderer. If I played PC, I'd absolutely build sunderer on bard too it's just THAT good. Granted, I played bard as a tank, not an enchanter or "mage"
                Doesn't really work on PC, supports just don't really have the gold to get both titanic and sundered in a reasonable time frame. Supports usually sit on support item +1 completed item for awhile unless they snowball hard. This is especially the case for bruiser items as they tend to be pricier than support items by a significant margin (3300/3100 for titanic/sundered)
                    Well.. top laners sit on two completed items for a while unless they snowball, too. Should they stop building bruisers' items, too? Jugglers sit on completed jungle item +1 completed item for a while as well. Should they stop building bruisers' items, too? Yes, it'll take longer to complete them. But if you're paying attention to the game state and your gold gain consistency across matches, you can easily adjust your playstyle and build order to better accommodate varying factors in the gold "deficit" that supports apparently have
                        Top laners still consistently are getting gold to build more items. If supports and top laners build the same items, top laners will be building them significantly faster. (also many bruiser items scale well with base stats/champ level, which top laners will have more of).

Bruiser items frankly aren't that amazing when you are behind in items, but are really strong when you are ahead compared to any other class.

Theres also a big difference between titanic + sundered compared to like solstice sleigh + sundered.

There's a reason there are 0 supports right now that build bruiser items outside of camille (who isn't doing so hot since nerfs to bloodsong). And camille is mostly there because she abuses bloodsong harder than any other champ (best sheen user in the game)
    I wouldn't call it tank shredding or that Liandry's was the main issue. However it definitely did contribute since pretty much every role in the game did significant damage to tank champions. While this was exacerbated by a lack of good MR items (outside of maybe FoN), and particularly no mr items you could build first, it didn't matter what role was attacking the tank, tanks just weren't tanky.

The issue with most mages right now is that luden's is kinda bad, and many of them feel much worse with the significant decrease in AH on mage builds.
        except that for the ones who can build them current liandry + riftbaker are far worse than old liandry (+ demonic)

the only difference is that the mages who actually struggle against tanks have no option left
            Classically, tanks are supposed to counter mages for the most part. It was part of the reason the adc role existed was to kill tanks.

And idk, as much as gwen/morde is a pain to deal with as tanks, that is also heavily because of their kit (and I'd still rather play against them than play tanks on mythic item patches)
                liandry mostly helped to deal with bruisers,tanks stacking MR never really suffered from it

and while I agree on what you said there is a difference between being countered and having an hopeless matchup,liandry ensured it was only the latter

point is liandry was never problematic on the champion you are afraid would become too strong against tanks with it
                    I disagree that liandries is decent into bruisers or tanks for that matter. I think wed see alot more mages top and mages splitpushing into enemy toplaners if it was. But we dont cause mages dont have the initial burst to kill through bruiser items and dont have the mobility to survive extended fights where liandries would see value.
                    To an extent yes, however during mythic items, there wasn't much MR for tanks to build. Most of the MR items gave like 40 MR, and none of them were first items (only jak'sho had MR for first tank item). It's why rumble, despite getting much better liandry's and more anti-tank damage in his kit is largely performing much worse into tanks this season relatively.

As a tank player at least, it is far less painful to play into magic damage now, and you are drastically tankier (unless it's like brand/lillia/asol or some other %hp magic damage champ that also build liandrys)
People on reddit would rather lose lp to champs like Ahri and Janna than get solokilled by Zed or Yone
I think Ahri is just a much harder champ to read. I always find it pretty easy to track how an Yas or Zed is going to play a fight, but Ahri just has so many more options
I find ahri more frustrating to play against personally, she becomes literally unkillable post 6.
    Not me managing to have negative KDA on ahri.
says the vex fizz player lol
I don't think you even need to face a good Ahri when she just kills you by existing as a squishy with W R and Lichbane after horribly missing Q and E
Or maybe due to personal preference / depending on your pool because I could tell you exactly the same about ahri to you
    not really you're just playing in low elo, where ahri isn't anything special
That’s entirely subjective
    Yes, it's subjective and it comes down to personal opinion. That being said, a lot more people find Zed more frustrating than Ahri. Zed is specifically left weak precisely because Riot knows most of the playerbase hates playing against it
        I wonder if riot plans to change zed’s kit?
Well, actually just cause the CD is already low doesnt mean the Haste isnt still great for the champs. Especially Kassadin is pretty happy to have less time between ults
Right. 3 second per target just looked it up. TIL
yea. my personal favorite example is sivir though. every second line in all of her 5 abilitys are the result of some item interaction they wanted to get rid off,  resulting in her being incredibly volatile and having complealty unique interactions with 0 mentions in the tooltips.
Sure but what about Stridebreaker? It didn't quite change gameplay all that much, simply allowed champs who like to chase people have an easier time doing it. I would say even Goredrinker didn't change gameplay all that much. Yes, it allowed certain fighters to sustain more than they did before, but it's still amplification of gameplay.

There are a bunch of champs who like to ult more often, want it to be stronger, center around their ult, that can't buy Malignance or feel like it's suboptimal on them, like Malzahar.
    Stride is still in the game.

Old Stride got removed because it removed the entire counterplay of juggernauts (being kiteable) by giving them an on-demand dash.
        Sure, but it is in a state considerably weakened. And I don't think Stride removed the counterplay in the way you mean unless you are talking about the time when it had that dash, which point I'd agree totally.

I don't think Gore defines gameplay to a lesser extent than nerfed Stride or Malignance does if the former were to be nerfed in the manner items like Stride or Liandry were to.
            I have no idea what you’re talking about.

Stride rewards champs that want to stay close to you by slowing you, making it harder to get away - before this state, it gave you a dash which was broken and had to be removed.

I don’t understand what you mean with „weakend state“ it’s exactly the same as last seasons stride.

Gore defined your gameplay. You became a drain tank when you bought it, even though you weren’t supposed to be one. It changed your gameplay like old stride or galeforce by giving you tools that you weren’t supposed to have.

Malignance only makes your ult stronger just like Rabadons makes your abilities stronger. Everyone who likes to ult buys that item. Even malzahar, even though you named him in champs that don’t want to buy it (no idea why, it’s his most purchased item)

Liandries is supposed to be an anti tank item that also compliments champs that have dps in their kit.
                Agreein with you here, just clarifying


Stride helps you stick to people, not aproach people. It is there so that once you get close to someone, they cant get away. It doesnt help you get in if your champ can't do it already.

Something like gore made champs who couldnt normally sustain on longer fights be able to. Sundered sky does the same now too. They patch a weakness instead of amplifying your strenght
                    Yea this
                > I don’t understand what you mean with „weakend state“ it’s exactly the same as last seasons stride.

No? It's slow is weaker considerably compared to it's mythic version, to the point where they had to go around and buff champs like Garen and Darius who used it who were now in the dumpster. It used to deal 175% total AD with a 40% slow for 3 seconds, not it deals %80 AD with a 35% slow that decays over 3 seconds, on top of having overall lower stats and not having haste anymore. 

> Gore defined your gameplay. You became a drain tank when you bought it, even though you weren’t supposed to be one. It changed your gameplay like old stride or galeforce by giving you tools that you weren’t supposed to have. 

Not really. Most of the champs who bought it were those who wanted to slug around in middle of the fight, those with both innate sustain or other means of surviving in the fight. It didn't change the fundamental gameplay of any champion outside of the situations where it was so strong that it could have the gameplay defining effect you describe, but those situations were short and were taken care of by Riot quickly.

> Even malzahar, even though you named him in champs that don’t want to buy it (no idea why, it’s his most purchased item)

He buys it, but he doesn't want to. Right now the optimal build, in terms of damage and utility, is manaless build of Liandry into Rylai into whatever, but because Malz cannot go manaless like Swain, Brand, etc. can, he HAS to buy Malignance. This is why Malz is much weaker this season compared to previous one, why his winrate fell by 2 percent, and why a Rioter came to Malz mains discord and asked his mains their opinions about changes they would make.

> Liandries is supposed to be an anti tank item that also compliments champs that have dps in their kit. 

Okay? That's not my point. My point is that I don't believe Gore would be that egregious if it's passive was nerfed considerably in the same way Stride and Liandry were nerfed to get in line as a legendary item.
Sure but you'd think a champ like Swain who can constantly amply the pools through his ult would love this, but because his use with the MPen portion is limited and he doesn't get that much mileage out of the Ulti Haste, so it remains a bit suboptimal. 

I agree that other AP mana items are just really unsatisfying. Again, mage mythics were pretty much okay, especially in their diversity, so I'm really not sure why Riot just ditched that and gave us a bunch of mana items that are mostly unsatisfying outside of Malignance, which is locked to certain champs.
    Yeah the biggest issue with the item is that it can't decide if it's a DoT item or a Mpen item. The truth is that it's an ultimate haste item.

On the other hand I don't think the mana items were particularly better last season.
        > The truth is that it's an ultimate haste item.

It's an ultimate haste item but in a really wonky way, where it's good if you can use it to either spam your spammable ult more or if you can be like Ahri and abuse the ulti haste in a way where your ult can have almost no cooldown at all at later levels. 

I thought mage mythics were decent last season, and I definitely enjoyed the aspect of almost every mage having at least 3 different mythic options they could switch around to decent enough satisfaction depending on the situation. It was certainly better than our current situation of having to choose between different types of meh.

This is absolutely not my experience. Ludens by default is what I remember.
                Nah there were plenty of Liandry users (Viktor this season for instance is feeling shitty due to the loss of liandry mythic) or crown users. Lots of ROA users too (anivia, ryze, swain depending on game etc). As lux there were plenty of games where it was good to go either ludens or liandry
                    Liandry users picked their Liandry and never looked at other items. Same with RoA users. If you weren't one of those, it was Ludens and you weren't excited about it. So Ludens by default.
                        > Liandry users picked their Liandry and never looked at other items.

Swain could and would go Luden's into certain teams regularly. Similarly Cass could easily go Liandry into certain teams.
                            Swain could and would go liandries, ludens, and ROA lol.
                        "ludens by default except for all the mages who didn't use Ludens which was probably more than half"
                            Well yes, that's the concept of default. If you had anything especially synergistic with your kit you'd pick that and you'd end up with Ludens if you didn't, which felt back. The new situation is exactly the same thing but with Malignance as one of the synergy options. They didn't solve anything for the champs that unhappily ended up buying Ludens but they also didn't make anything worse either. The situation being your kit picking the mana item for you or having to pick an unexciting one was already there.
                        ? I don't know what elo you're in but there were a huge number of mages who could swap between Luden's and Liandry's last season, and you didn't need to have a special synergy to want Liandry's either. It was a common choice even on champions like Syndra, who made a decision between that and Luden's based on how squishy the enemy comp was and how much they needed the haste in a particular game.

The number of mages who were hard-locked into Luden's by lack of other options was extremely small. Almost every mage could opt into Liandry's if they felt like it.
                        Syndra could go both
                My experience was that, which maybe skewed because I play these tanky battlemages like Swain, Vlad, Cass etc was that a lot of popular mages like Ori, Syndra, Viktor, Xerath etc. could opt for Liandry if there were enough health stackers because they got really good mileage out of the damage amp from bonus health, which at times could give up to 10 percent bonus damage on all damage. I would also regularly see some of them take Crown if the situation permitted it.
Which champ?

Its probably when you have multiple items with similar winrates. Or just have items for the game's niche.

Like, bruisers like Noc get to chose between bruiser items and tank items based on each game. Assassins to a devree get to choose between all the lethality items and some bruiser items

Mages don't have that many options or niche items, their builds get very cookie cutter and boring
I think it's a problem you can alleviate.

The problem is that a lot of items aren't designed to be per-game situational - they're designed to be per-champion situational. Like surface level both Liandry's and Nashor's are sustained damage AP items with one being better vs tanks and the other being better vs squishies, but in practice they aren't substitutes at all. And speaking of Nashor's, it's problematic in that it's an item useless to the vast majority of the champions it's supposedly in the item class for (mages) and core on the couple that actually buy it. OTOH you have items like Morello's and Banshee's that very much are per-game situational buys, but because of those core items, you usually have to delay them, can only get one or two, and there frankly just aren't many of them.

For mages specifically, that problem is often compounded by the fact that all AP bruisers, assassins, and sustained damage dealers have to share a single item pool. The bruisers tend to be able to dip into some of the tank items for a couple slots, but their other items are still taking up space in the mage pool. Going back to the Nashor's example, it's the only attack speed item for AP champions which makes it a waste of an item pool slot for most mages, but it needs to exist for champions like Azir and Gwen that build AP and need attack speed - the result is an item a few champions really want with no alternative for it.

Mana items are also a point of issue for mages in that there aren't very many of them. Sure, there being 4 looks kind of good, but again, those have to cover multiple different sub-classes of AP champion. The result tends to be that there isn't great diversity there because those 4 options have to cover so much ground and get designed to cover a specific archetype, and since the champions that need a mana item typically really need to get it first, that bottleneck is the first thing you see every single game. AD champions get around this by simply not needing mana items most of the time, though the options for those that do are fairly lacking as well.

None of this is helped by items like DCap that are just turbo generic powerful stat slots with no alternatives.
More impactful active items could be a step at least, less skilled players will immediately avoid them. Think things like old prowlers claw, or maybe a targeted zhonyas, or blade mail from dota. Not saying this won't get figured out, but at least we'll have more options to play with
    people want to play the champs, not the items unfortunately which is why stuff like Galeforce and Prowlers won't come back. They talked about it when they removed Prowlers from the mythics IIRC.
If they can make use of all the stats, then they build it because they use it well. Not making a comment on the items balance, simply pointing out that stats are just a valid reason to get an item, debabtely more than the unique effect.
    the stats are good but the item effect is horrible on Ahri that's exactly what I'm saying

the pool from her ult will be very small and she has no way to keep people inside so she pretty much only makes uses of the stats with the passive being as good as inexistent,yet it's still better than say ludens which has both good stats and an useful effect

she doesn't make full use of the item and it's still the best option,don't you see the problem?
        I understand what you are saying, but I disagree the effect is horrible on her. Unless I am misunderstanding an interaction here, her ult gets like 3 charges. Each charge fires a few bolts to nearby enemies. If she times her ult and is in a perfect scenario she can proc the pools 9 individual times. That's extra damage for free, as well as MR reduction for anyone in the pools. If she dashed in, landed a charm on you, you are now in a damage circle, with reduced MR against a decently strong burst. 

She may not be constantly procing the pool like Kassadin would, but she still can very easily benefit from the passive, along with the stats. 

Once again, I don't play Ahri, so if her ult doesn't actually proc the passive for someone reason, that's my bad.
            the 3 sec CD usually means she procs it twice at best (even only once per target if she doesn't space a lot between ults,it takes 2 seconds to use all casts for reference),what you're describing is an extremely unlikely scenario

her E makes them walk out of the pool already on its own + you usually either use it before or significantly after proccing malognace

it's not too unusual to get 60 damage or so per solo fight unless they're a sitting duck

it really sounds good on paper but in practice this item is awful on her,besides the broken stats
It’s not that it’s broken, it just takes up so much of the power budget on champs that use it (look at Irelia)
literally look at her most common builds

it is just a collection of the most gold efficient items she can afford with whatever income she gets, with rabadon's as a cherry if she's doing well. she takes absolutely no consideration as to whether an item fits well into her kit or not. vegan ahri exists in both proplay and soloqueue and is completely viable for a reason. the champion is the problem


nerfing malignance will do nothing
    her best build is malignace lich bane,then rabadons/banshee/void staff or bloom which all seems pretty normal in terms of cost,if you were right we'd see items like Shurelya,Rylai or other pure utility items,instead she always goes for damage/CDR stacking

then again you talk as if literally every single champion in the game doesn't benefit from gold efficiency and tends to build the items that give you the most
        My fault, I should have clarified gold efficient *mage* items, I did in another thread about Ahri but forgot to say it in this comment.


Items like Rabadon's and Lich Bane (or its 2nd damage item equivalent on other champions) are always going to be the highest winrate items, but the very context of their purchase is those champions being ahead enough in the game to justify the purchase to begin with. Items like Rabadon's get picked lower and lower the higher elo you go (but the win rate also goes up, because when you're ahead enough to purchase a high elo player utilizes the spike better) regardless of whatever mage you're playing because the cost is simply not as justifiable in a standard build because of how it slows down your item spikes.

The problem with Ahri is that she can freely opt into low damage builds while simultaneously being able to capitalize on more damage oriented purchases if the game state allows it. Champions like Viktor and Syndra are stuck in a hole where they *have* to build damage because purchasing for example horizon focus 2nd even though it doesn't technically fit with their kit will butcher their usefulness in a game. Ahri can be set behind and not give a single fuck  while also being a total nightmare if she is ahead in any given game.
I mean, the first 4 days of this season teemo mains were everywhere. He had multiple srooms and could literally do what he was supposed to do, annoy the enemy team and provide A LOT of vision.
They basically did though.

Shrooms went from 3/4/5 to a 2/3/4 max shrooms they can hold. And the time it takes to recharge them is also up through the roof.

And then i'm not even talking about that snitch of a cannon minion
    And half the damage to minions.
L take
    L brain, if any.
        Ight I'll entertain you, what exactly bothers you/ do you think is wrong with teemo shrooms in aram?
            No pink wards or oracles anymore. You can't do anything but wait for a cannon minion to come by, which means it's impossible to push even after an ace and it slows the game down a ton. Same issue with shaco.
                Nah the longer the game goes on the more cannons spawn and if you get the inhib teemo becomes considerably weaker than before.
                That's a pretty gross exaggeration of shacos capabilities. Boxes die in 1 auto/ability and aren't able to 1 shot a wave. They also don't stay on map for very long and most a wave will hit 2 or 3. Boxes won't be able to stop a push. As for teems shrooms, what else does teemo do in aram? He blinds and throws shrooms. He doesn't have the same aeo dmg as other mages. He has far less range than other mages and marksmen. He is very squishy, has no cc other than blind. I think it's OK if he kills a wave after he dies.
                    Shaco also has a box limit of 6 in aram iirc. Still obnoxious playing against him as a melee/tank since its impossible to engage him without cannon wave but not OP imo
                    Sure, Shaco's not as bad and teemo is relatively easy to kill. You asked why people thought teemo wasn't fun to play against in aram, that's why. It's not about winrate, it's that the specific mechanics he relies on aren't fun to play against, at least for me.
                        I think teemos shrooms are actually fun to play against. It's something different that you have to pay attention to. Like a mini game. Plus, should teemo be removed from a specific game mode just because they think it's unfun? Seems like a silly take imo.
                There are infinity cannons in aram…
            The optimal way to use them has become spamming them down the middle of lane where minions come. If your team is pushing, the enemies die if they chase past their own minions at all. If youre being pushed in, it just becomes a game of can the mushrooms stall long enough to get you back in. Either way theyre unfun for all players but the teemo, and even then its not fun putting 90% of them in one place, and thats on an ultimate ability, which are supposed to be the most exciting abilities to use.
            Local man can’t resist the allure of bushes or walking ahead of minions.
Cannons and super minions reveal them. Teemo shrooms are quite weak in ARAM at this point. I've reached the point of building to make his Q and autos more useful than focusing on the shrooms at this point.
They deal like 0 dmg to minions, are easy to clear every other wave... like idk
    ..0 damage to minions? It still does enough to wreck waves even after the nerf
        2-3 shrooms for melees isn't really wrecking and certainly not effective or efficient. 
    They literally wreck every wave, even if they are seen they still explode on the melee minions. And he can throw them in real time + bounce making them impossible to clear unless you have at least 3 range (still alive and in range to clear them as he drops them).
But I guess if your have the MMR of a clown and you play your ARAM with iron players this probably is not an issue for you. 

Every game against a Teemo is a nightmare to end. You can disagree, but that'd just show how clueless you are. Get rid of them or bring back the oracle elixir.
        > You can disagree, but that'd just show how clueless you are.

Yikes. In all honesty, I fully agree with your overall point about teemo in ARAM, but that's such a shitty attitude to have lol.

"If you disagree with me, it must be because you're stupid. I'm not going to listen to anyone who says anything else!" 

Get it together, bud.
            I would not mind arguing in good faith, but wtf is that :
"They deal like 0 dmg to minions, are easy to clear every other wave... like idk"

Either it's sarcasm, in which case he's missing the /s, either it's not worth talking about/with.

If I told you "Teemo is bad in ARAM because people don't use their ult", you'd be a fool to argue with me. It's pointless and fruitless.

Also, the league of legends subreddit is the last place on the internet I'd think of arguing on, regardless of what you actually say and how well you argue/document your point. People who disagree philosophically will not bother to read/educate themselves and will downvote into oblivion regardless.
        Factually untrue. 2-3 shrooms for melees isn't really wrecking and certainly not effective or efficient. Just shows you don't play the game.
        [49% W/R](https://lolalytics.com/lol/teemo/aram/build/?tier=all). The only rank where he is above 50% is iron, and his W/R falls as rank increases. If you can't win vs teemo on aram then that's on you bro.
Kiddo Aram Player, be quiet
I think it is exactly the same problem ap shyv has. 

When your whole shtick is basicly undodgeable atomic bombs (dragonform E and RQ respectivly) its supremly stupid to play against.
    >basically undodgeable atomic bombs

RQ may be hard to dodge, but it’s easy to avoid. Karma has absolutely no backline access, so if you just position properly she will never damage you.
        Thats 100% true and 100% irrelevant at the same time depending on what Champion you play. Good luck avoiding a midlane karma hugging her ADC as melee midlaner
            Sure, but there’s plenty of other champs that shit on melee mid laners too. The fact that you get counterpicked sometimes does not make a champion OP.
                I did not say with one word that i think she is OP. I only said that she is absolutly atrocious to play against in mid and she should kindly piss off to botlane. I stand by that still 🤐
    People always discredit how much damage Shyvanas ult deals in AP builds

Landing onto squishies with your fly in, is absolutely a core part of her damage. Not just her breath from a distance
        It really depends on what you need to be doing at the current moment. AP Shyv has the ability to seriously chunk and sometimes oneshot enemies from afar, in some situations you're getting more damage from ulting backward because you'll be alive long enough to deal more damage. I can think of a couple champs I'm just not ulting onto as glass cannon AP Shyv.
        Just played with AP Shyv on ARAM that seemed to rely solely on the R damage. She jumped in, almost always landed just on Poppy and Pantheon, promptly died (who would have guessed) and started blaming everyone for not following up.
    Karma had an added bonus of also being really fast and healing and shielding a shit ton, which only adds to the frustration of playing against her
    Karma is on a hard timer tho compared to Shyv.
    Bronze level take
Totally agreed.
If you start using punctuation in your sentences that would help. I damn near had a stroke Reading that and am still not sure i got your meaning
    Not my problem if you cant understand English. Both of my sentences are gramatically correct, I havent skipped any necessary stuff. Also not my fault english is too basic and lacks real punctation, which many more complex languages have.
        Ah Look. You are indeed able to form coherent sentences! Congratulation!

*edit also your whole Point is somehow extrapolating my opinion on whole classes of champions from my opinion on one (1) support being absolutly stupid to play against in mid. 

Interesting take to say the least.
            And you are able to read, congrats!

Karma was literally designed to be a midlaner but was pushed out of it like most other mages (zilean, velkoz, brand, zyra). And people always cry that people play mages as supports then people cry when people play mages in their original role. What if people would stop crying if a mage is able to play the game and also carry and not just be a wave clearing slave?
                You are making the biggest strawman Argument ive Seen in a while here. I have Not Said a single word about any mage support other than karma and not a single thing about another midlaner than karma. 

Since you cant stop putting words in my mouth i will just stop responding now. Maybe Go argue with the persons that allegedly hold the opinions you are arguing against, not with someone that has not said a single word of the above.
Please, they sealed Seraphine's fate when so many parts of her kit got bonuses off of interacting with allies. They should have known that Passive, W, and R being strictly better with allies nearby would push her into support.
I just want to RQ one shot people. RE is a waste of R as it doesn't reset the timer.
    Yep, that explains the comment and downvotes. I got into a platinum 4 peaker debate. That’s awkward.
        Rude
Maybe they should make the ult CD scale with lvl like they do with the lethality slow item
    Serlyda does not scale wtih level, it scales with how much letgality you have
        then maybe make ult cdr scale woth how much regular cdr you have?
            That's tough because I think Ability Haste is already in low supply. Could be wrong, but I see that potentially warping builds around it. It either warps builds or it gets forgotten about.
                It's not in low supply, it's just not on any of the big utility or burst items that make the big numbers happen or stop an enemy's big numbers from happening (BV, Zhonya's, Shadowflame, Stormsurge, Void, and Deathcap).

AA/Seraph's, Malignance, Cosmic Drive, and Luden's all give 25 normal haste. 4 items for 50% CDR is very good if spell slinging is your character's thing. That's a LOT of mana, too. Cryptbloom and Horizon Focus are also really good haste items.
                    And out of 3 of those items, you're only building 1 because there's no need for multiple mana items unless you're Ryze
                        You're trading raw damage for cooldowns. No one ever asked if building raw CDR was going to be the optimal choice or whether some stats are wasted. That's irrelevant here. The point is there is a ton of haste available if you want to go that route, and Seraph's makes sure the mana doesn't go completely to waste with a bigger shield and more AP.

We're not talking about need. But it's not like a set like this is bad in and of itself.

Luden/Malignance/seraph (whichever you need/want), Cosmic Drive, Horizon, Cryptbloom, DCap, Sorcs.

That's a total of 85 haste, which is 46% CDR. I honestly don't see the problem here. That's more than was ever achievable before ability haste existed. You can bump that to 50% if you're okay with letting sorcs slide...but probably shouldn't do that.
                Tbf, we really don’t need AH in the game atm. Cooldowns are already so low for most champs that the traditional counterplay of abusing openings is much more restricted. It’s IMO one of the poorer design philosophies Riot has picked up in the recent seasons. 

Everyone talks about the damage being the problem, but I’d prefer high damage rewarding landing skills, but being harshly punished for missing them. Doesn’t feel that way at the moment as rotations come back up pretty quickly.
            That gives it a quadratic scaling which is probably not what you want.

It would have to be balanced around builds with lots of haste, which would make it bad in all other cases.
                idk I was just throwing shit out ngl. Maybe you could give it a RoA type of deal where ult CD goes up per a certain time period to a cap? or give it something like Axiom Arc's passive but touch the numbers a bit and just remove the ult cd altogether? idk I'm literally just spitting out whayever comes to mind lmao
            There's already not a lot of it, and unlike lethality, it gets less effective the more you have
    Maybe they should just not make stupid items like this in the first place.

Had high hopes for this season at the start once they removed mythics but Riot cannot take a single step forward without taking 2 steps back.
        The second they announced that shit it was so obvious it would be going down this same path. Riot makes unique item that is overtuned for certain characters>they nerf the character and make them reliant on said items>nerf the item to trash tier dragging the nerfed champs with it.
But Kassadin has always activated at 11...
    People are still stuck years ago where 11 and 16 was a gigantic difference in power level. 16 is still a good spike but it's not what it was
        yup, kass comes online with items, not levels (need 11 ofc)

still u get 2,5 sec ult cd without malignance rn at 11 with some haste/Ultimate Hunter
That's been the case for a few years now.

lvl 11 kassa is strong enough to impact the game. By 16 he should be at a winning position for the most part
Just make it have an 8s cd already, kass getting faster ults is fine but a mr shred into qwe is a lot of bonus damage, malignance being both a utility and damage/pseudo pen item is dumb
Yep 100%

Although i think then the item is built by only 2 champs. Malzahar and Lissandra
I feel like Ahri's problems stem from how automatic her waveclear is.

Is there really any need to have both a Q which will oneshot the backline without any special attention (not really any specialist item rushes / AP thresholds to hit / or require dematerisaliser) *AND* a W which has a baked in execute when under 20% hp?

Its way too easy to hit perfect CS with her and that catalyses any of her other issues.
    Which is kinda weird, i remember the first times i played ahri a couple seasons ago i needed dematerializer at least on the mages, now q just insta clears them.
        Pretty sure that was the time where every midlaner went demat, so that wasn't just an ahri thing
    It’s insane you’re downvoted for this lmao, the reason she’s broken is the threshold for her to full clear a wave with Q got much lower with the AP ratio increase. You’re completely correct and it’s bizarre you have any downvotes for it
    Why is this comment downvoted lol? Ahri can just press q+w and be moving to bot/jungle already on any wave that is not cannon, that alone gives her so much pressure that allows her to do whatever she want in the map. Im sure that if ahri didn't have such a strong waveclear so early her winrate would drop even if malignance remains strong.
It only costs 2700 gold too. Hexplate is 3k. Why is the mage version so much cheaper when mages are even more ult gated than bruisers?
https://www.deeplol.gg/champions/ahri/mastery/all

idk who you are referring too but almost all of them are building malignance
    LegitKorea is who I’m referring too, I might be out of date then
OPT or not, the overwhelming data supports Malignance > Lich Band is the most effective build for Ahri atm.
    The data is a bit skewed though, the playstyle for Malig first is different.

You likely only fight with your ult if it’s on such a short CD, whereas LB you can be aggro outside of the CD, which is arguably more difficult but could pay off better.
        Yeah  but the problem is that her fighting capabilities with malignance and ult are far superior.

Malignance gives a total of 45 AH to ult. If you get +5 from GM, 50AH translate into 33%CDR, for each 1 min of the ult, she will reduce it by 20 seconds. Consider Ahri's Ult, it's CD are 130/105/80. With malignance + gm now her ult CD is 87/70/53. She can pretty much get this before 11 mins. Now you have to deal with an ahri who can TF way more often. Outside malignance  she would need at least 2 items to achieve the same spam capability. God forbid she gets vantage in lane and she gets more items early, from lvl 11 onwards it becomes toxic getting sniped that easy. She will be able to use her ult just to kill you without i
objectives on map just because she can B, get back with more items and have her ult ON again.
        I have no idea why you’re mentioning LB to support Malignance data being off FOR AHRI which it should not be. Lolanalytics also puts put their methodology and it looks pretty solid to me. 

I have no opinion on what Malignance is like for champs that aren’t Ahri but for her the CDR on Ult gives her a cycle of 3+ dashes w/ passive damage that can proc her Lich Bane auto while she weaves in QWE.
            …..LB is LichBane shortened….. figured that would be obvious in the context of “items on Ahri”.

I’m just saying Malignance playstyle is different than Luden’s into Lich.
                OH! My mind immediately went to LeBlanc (probably because I used to OTP her a few years back). 

Also to clarify, I was saying Malignance INTO Lich Bane not necessarily Malignance is better than Lich Bane. Even though I think both Mal into LB and Mal > LB are both best/true atm.
                    That’s definitely fair lol, I know it’s the same acronym for both, I coulda just said Lich like I did in the second response I guess :p

It’s really good on Ahri, even the damage is decent, I just tend to assume a 120AP item could outperform it in some situations, and if you’re going to take Luden’s you don’t need the extra mana > AP.
    The data supports that there is very little to no difference between Malignance and other builds. It definitely isn't even 1% over ludens or something.

It's really not at all the reason Ahri gets nerfed or w/e. People acting like Ahri is the same as Teemo is crazy.
One tricks are not a good source for what the best builds are, many have suboptimal builds because it fits their playstyle or they're used to it.
puddle size is big enough even on champs that spam ult so it isnt really a big deal
Which is why Lux, Karma, and Corki have large pools and ults they can cast every <25 seconds, and champs like Malzahar, Ahri, and Annie have small ones with ults closer to 60 seconds.

It's not balanced by cooldown, but rather by multihit/dot vs burst.
Oh yeah I forgot to mention that it's actually a bit shorter since I remember it does proc twice lmao
I understand the idea that people react to what they see but it really doesn’t take much to hover the tooltip and see that fed karthus has only gotten 2k damage out of it in 30 minutes
what the fuck happened to my goalposts they were there a second ago
    i think you are confused grandpa the op of this said championS not arhi
    it was clearly a continuation of my original point
Do buffs expire after a certain amount of time?
    No but the context for them does. Just fucking remove the ability haste from maligma
        Buffs compound regardless. I agree that Malignance is overpowered but Ahri is also overtuned right now.
She did need them at the start of the season. We knew what to build but it wasn’t until the dmg buff where she became slightly overtuned
the fact remains that shes power creeped her way into the number 1 blind pickable mid laner
    Ahri is not blind pickable. People keep saying that when she has straight counters Lock in Zed, Akali,Yasuo and she's in for a rough time.
        low elo ahri abuser detected, none of those are counters. and she doesnt have any real counter as she can neutralise any bad lane
            Sorry to break it to you 90% of the game is played in low elo not high elo. And the low elo is what brings in the money.
                Yes and high elo is what is balanced around 99% of the time. So whats the point in even bringing low elo up in a balance discussion? Almost never is a change aimed for them because things like meta don't even matter down there.
                People in low elo are humans who are capable of learning. It might take them a little longer, but they do it all the time. So if the reason something is strong or weak in low elo is lack of knowledge on the player's part, it is reasonable to ask that player to just learn.
        Ahri is very blind pickable, she’s good into zed and can control the wave easily against Akali/zed, she may struggle with yasuo but even then can still waveclear with no threat. She’s safe as hell with great waveclear and decent ways to lane into melee and ranged. Shes the definition of blind pickable
        Ahri wins or goes even in all of these matchups. Like you could not have picked worst champions to suggest as counters.
        ? not a single one of those champs give ahri a rough time.

she wins at least 51% of the time against every one of those champs if you look at the stats alone.

And just based of me playing ahri. None of those champs provide any problems in the slightest
            I agree with you but I also want to point out that a lot of these champions have less than 50% win rates because they’re mechanically intensive. So using statistics to determine what “should” happen might be a bit skewed because on average people are losing on these champs which makes ahri look better into them. (She’s still good into all of them, I just don’t love the Winrate metric)
                well neither do I usually but if the stats are 51-55% wr in pretty much all ranks, its a safe argument to make in my book.

 I should think that the ahris and zeds in master rank at least know how their champs work, yet its still almost 55% wr to ahri
                    That’s fair! I think you’re right!
1. Ahri was awful at the start of the season none of the items worked on her.

2. People have been going between Ludens and Malig since PBE but again both items were awful

3. Ahri could not do any damage at the start of the season, her WR kept going down as the season progressed

4. Ahri got the buffs because she can't do anything and is reliant on her team to do damage, she's an assassin imagine not being able todo damage as an assassin.
    Shes an "assassin" with amazing wave clear and self sustain in lane.

no other assassin has that in an even game state, she shouldnt do as much dmg as assassins.

The reason she is nr 1 right now is because she can do assassin shit while have an extremely safe laning phase and managing 10/cs a min AND following roams, initiating roams and pulling off side lane ganks
        She’s not even number 1. Idk where this comes froms. She’s not the number 1 midlaner and all assassins out damage her. 

Ahri has good wave clear good roam and a great mobility but that’s where it ends. 

She’s literally rank 20 on LoL Analytics. 
Ahri is just the most popular midlaner because she’s 1. Cute 2 fox girl  3. Faker
            Shes rank 3 on lol analytics

Shes nr 1 on numerous high elo tier lists.

Also youre quoting third party stat sites but you still considering yasuo, akali, zed hard counters despite them saying otherwise? nothing youre saying makes sense mate, sorry
You're telling me Ahri with 5% AP ratio on Q and slight HP growth in 14.4 meant Ahri was playable? I somewhat overexaggerated but she was being played a lot in pro too.
    10% since her q has two dmg instances also she got an old e-CD nerf reverted on 14.2 aditionally it probably also helped that riot buffed malignance by 5AH in 14.4 and made it cheaper in 14.3.     
The cumulative amounts of buffs she and her items needed is honestly a testament to how shit they were.
        At the same time, Stormsurge also got nerfed 3 patches in a row from 14.1 hot fix to 14.3. This is also probably a reason as her matchups changed.
Luden's only feels strong when it breaks spellshields like EoN or banshee's.
Size of Malignance field scales with damage per hit. Multi-hit ultimates do very little damage and thus make a tiny field for the shred
    While this makes sense and would make them less usefull, Syndra's ult hits quite fast so I think most of it would still hit in the tiny field (at least on the edge of the field from each orb). But I may be wrong in that regard
        The orbs would all benefit from the bonus but you’d end up losing a lot of the AOE value from it. They’d take maybe 50(?) damage from Malignance puddle and the rest of your combo with Ult-start likely wouldn’t benefit from it.
            Maybe I played her wrong for the most part, but I usually ended the combo/skrimish with ult, but regardless, you are right that it wouldnt give enough value and certainly not for other skills. I wasnt saying that Malignance was significantly good on Syndra as I havent played her much since the changes and didnt look at the statistics, was just proposing that it is not as unusable as the original comment said.
Syndra could be one of the better users out of the list, but I generally believe Malignance is still her weakest LC item out of the three. Archangels gives defense through the shield and safe scaling, where as Luden's offers an aggressive build path with Alternator in it and has a better damaging passive.

Hwei - I think Malignance is just really bad on him. With the way the item works he always gets an absolutely tiny Malignance puddle and by the time the slow has ramped up (for the QW follow up) they're long out of it.

Viktor -I don't know, it might be decent on him actually.
Malignance isn't *terrible* on Hwei, but Hwei doesn't really depend on his ult as much as other champions. So he doesn't get as much use out of the effect or the CDR.
>Toplane was and is still dominated by bruisers who are basically almost as tanky whilst dealing almost the same dmg as an ADC.

fuck bruisers like garen darius etc but still adc have way more range which is most important stat at 4+ items
As a top main, yes, 100% this. Shen main, Shenpaiislife, and having hardswapped sunfire cape on shen for divine sunderer & titanic the moment the items dropped, I can say with absolute certainty they were a MASSIVE power spike, even before heartsteel abuse was a thing, on any tank or bruiser.
    It's mind-boggling how long it took for them to nerf Sunderer and even this new iteration of Sunderer is only being properly nerfed now in pbe despite it being so centralising.
        Yep, i dont play on pc anymore, but every support I play on wildrift builds titanic hydra & sunderer. If I played PC, I'd absolutely build sunderer on bard too it's just THAT good. Granted, I played bard as a tank, not an enchanter or "mage"
            Doesn't really work on PC, supports just don't really have the gold to get both titanic and sundered in a reasonable time frame. Supports usually sit on support item +1 completed item for awhile unless they snowball hard. This is especially the case for bruiser items as they tend to be pricier than support items by a significant margin (3300/3100 for titanic/sundered)
                Well.. top laners sit on two completed items for a while unless they snowball, too. Should they stop building bruisers' items, too? Jugglers sit on completed jungle item +1 completed item for a while as well. Should they stop building bruisers' items, too? Yes, it'll take longer to complete them. But if you're paying attention to the game state and your gold gain consistency across matches, you can easily adjust your playstyle and build order to better accommodate varying factors in the gold "deficit" that supports apparently have
                    Top laners still consistently are getting gold to build more items. If supports and top laners build the same items, top laners will be building them significantly faster. (also many bruiser items scale well with base stats/champ level, which top laners will have more of).

Bruiser items frankly aren't that amazing when you are behind in items, but are really strong when you are ahead compared to any other class.

Theres also a big difference between titanic + sundered compared to like solstice sleigh + sundered.

There's a reason there are 0 supports right now that build bruiser items outside of camille (who isn't doing so hot since nerfs to bloodsong). And camille is mostly there because she abuses bloodsong harder than any other champ (best sheen user in the game)
I wouldn't call it tank shredding or that Liandry's was the main issue. However it definitely did contribute since pretty much every role in the game did significant damage to tank champions. While this was exacerbated by a lack of good MR items (outside of maybe FoN), and particularly no mr items you could build first, it didn't matter what role was attacking the tank, tanks just weren't tanky.

The issue with most mages right now is that luden's is kinda bad, and many of them feel much worse with the significant decrease in AH on mage builds.
    except that for the ones who can build them current liandry + riftbaker are far worse than old liandry (+ demonic)

the only difference is that the mages who actually struggle against tanks have no option left
        Classically, tanks are supposed to counter mages for the most part. It was part of the reason the adc role existed was to kill tanks.

And idk, as much as gwen/morde is a pain to deal with as tanks, that is also heavily because of their kit (and I'd still rather play against them than play tanks on mythic item patches)
            liandry mostly helped to deal with bruisers,tanks stacking MR never really suffered from it

and while I agree on what you said there is a difference between being countered and having an hopeless matchup,liandry ensured it was only the latter

point is liandry was never problematic on the champion you are afraid would become too strong against tanks with it
                I disagree that liandries is decent into bruisers or tanks for that matter. I think wed see alot more mages top and mages splitpushing into enemy toplaners if it was. But we dont cause mages dont have the initial burst to kill through bruiser items and dont have the mobility to survive extended fights where liandries would see value.
                To an extent yes, however during mythic items, there wasn't much MR for tanks to build. Most of the MR items gave like 40 MR, and none of them were first items (only jak'sho had MR for first tank item). It's why rumble, despite getting much better liandry's and more anti-tank damage in his kit is largely performing much worse into tanks this season relatively.

As a tank player at least, it is far less painful to play into magic damage now, and you are drastically tankier (unless it's like brand/lillia/asol or some other %hp magic damage champ that also build liandrys)
Not me managing to have negative KDA on ahri.
not really you're just playing in low elo, where ahri isn't anything special
Yes, it's subjective and it comes down to personal opinion. That being said, a lot more people find Zed more frustrating than Ahri. Zed is specifically left weak precisely because Riot knows most of the playerbase hates playing against it
    I wonder if riot plans to change zed’s kit?
Stride is still in the game.

Old Stride got removed because it removed the entire counterplay of juggernauts (being kiteable) by giving them an on-demand dash.
    Sure, but it is in a state considerably weakened. And I don't think Stride removed the counterplay in the way you mean unless you are talking about the time when it had that dash, which point I'd agree totally.

I don't think Gore defines gameplay to a lesser extent than nerfed Stride or Malignance does if the former were to be nerfed in the manner items like Stride or Liandry were to.
        I have no idea what you’re talking about.

Stride rewards champs that want to stay close to you by slowing you, making it harder to get away - before this state, it gave you a dash which was broken and had to be removed.

I don’t understand what you mean with „weakend state“ it’s exactly the same as last seasons stride.

Gore defined your gameplay. You became a drain tank when you bought it, even though you weren’t supposed to be one. It changed your gameplay like old stride or galeforce by giving you tools that you weren’t supposed to have.

Malignance only makes your ult stronger just like Rabadons makes your abilities stronger. Everyone who likes to ult buys that item. Even malzahar, even though you named him in champs that don’t want to buy it (no idea why, it’s his most purchased item)

Liandries is supposed to be an anti tank item that also compliments champs that have dps in their kit.
            Agreein with you here, just clarifying


Stride helps you stick to people, not aproach people. It is there so that once you get close to someone, they cant get away. It doesnt help you get in if your champ can't do it already.

Something like gore made champs who couldnt normally sustain on longer fights be able to. Sundered sky does the same now too. They patch a weakness instead of amplifying your strenght
                Yea this
            > I don’t understand what you mean with „weakend state“ it’s exactly the same as last seasons stride.

No? It's slow is weaker considerably compared to it's mythic version, to the point where they had to go around and buff champs like Garen and Darius who used it who were now in the dumpster. It used to deal 175% total AD with a 40% slow for 3 seconds, not it deals %80 AD with a 35% slow that decays over 3 seconds, on top of having overall lower stats and not having haste anymore. 

> Gore defined your gameplay. You became a drain tank when you bought it, even though you weren’t supposed to be one. It changed your gameplay like old stride or galeforce by giving you tools that you weren’t supposed to have. 

Not really. Most of the champs who bought it were those who wanted to slug around in middle of the fight, those with both innate sustain or other means of surviving in the fight. It didn't change the fundamental gameplay of any champion outside of the situations where it was so strong that it could have the gameplay defining effect you describe, but those situations were short and were taken care of by Riot quickly.

> Even malzahar, even though you named him in champs that don’t want to buy it (no idea why, it’s his most purchased item)

He buys it, but he doesn't want to. Right now the optimal build, in terms of damage and utility, is manaless build of Liandry into Rylai into whatever, but because Malz cannot go manaless like Swain, Brand, etc. can, he HAS to buy Malignance. This is why Malz is much weaker this season compared to previous one, why his winrate fell by 2 percent, and why a Rioter came to Malz mains discord and asked his mains their opinions about changes they would make.

> Liandries is supposed to be an anti tank item that also compliments champs that have dps in their kit. 

Okay? That's not my point. My point is that I don't believe Gore would be that egregious if it's passive was nerfed considerably in the same way Stride and Liandry were nerfed to get in line as a legendary item.
Yeah the biggest issue with the item is that it can't decide if it's a DoT item or a Mpen item. The truth is that it's an ultimate haste item.

On the other hand I don't think the mana items were particularly better last season.
    > The truth is that it's an ultimate haste item.

It's an ultimate haste item but in a really wonky way, where it's good if you can use it to either spam your spammable ult more or if you can be like Ahri and abuse the ulti haste in a way where your ult can have almost no cooldown at all at later levels. 

I thought mage mythics were decent last season, and I definitely enjoyed the aspect of almost every mage having at least 3 different mythic options they could switch around to decent enough satisfaction depending on the situation. It was certainly better than our current situation of having to choose between different types of meh.

This is absolutely not my experience. Ludens by default is what I remember.
            Nah there were plenty of Liandry users (Viktor this season for instance is feeling shitty due to the loss of liandry mythic) or crown users. Lots of ROA users too (anivia, ryze, swain depending on game etc). As lux there were plenty of games where it was good to go either ludens or liandry
                Liandry users picked their Liandry and never looked at other items. Same with RoA users. If you weren't one of those, it was Ludens and you weren't excited about it. So Ludens by default.
                    > Liandry users picked their Liandry and never looked at other items.

Swain could and would go Luden's into certain teams regularly. Similarly Cass could easily go Liandry into certain teams.
                        Swain could and would go liandries, ludens, and ROA lol.
                    "ludens by default except for all the mages who didn't use Ludens which was probably more than half"
                        Well yes, that's the concept of default. If you had anything especially synergistic with your kit you'd pick that and you'd end up with Ludens if you didn't, which felt back. The new situation is exactly the same thing but with Malignance as one of the synergy options. They didn't solve anything for the champs that unhappily ended up buying Ludens but they also didn't make anything worse either. The situation being your kit picking the mana item for you or having to pick an unexciting one was already there.
                    ? I don't know what elo you're in but there were a huge number of mages who could swap between Luden's and Liandry's last season, and you didn't need to have a special synergy to want Liandry's either. It was a common choice even on champions like Syndra, who made a decision between that and Luden's based on how squishy the enemy comp was and how much they needed the haste in a particular game.

The number of mages who were hard-locked into Luden's by lack of other options was extremely small. Almost every mage could opt into Liandry's if they felt like it.
                    Syndra could go both
            My experience was that, which maybe skewed because I play these tanky battlemages like Swain, Vlad, Cass etc was that a lot of popular mages like Ori, Syndra, Viktor, Xerath etc. could opt for Liandry if there were enough health stackers because they got really good mileage out of the damage amp from bonus health, which at times could give up to 10 percent bonus damage on all damage. I would also regularly see some of them take Crown if the situation permitted it.

people want to play the champs, not the items unfortunately which is why stuff like Galeforce and Prowlers won't come back. They talked about it when they removed Prowlers from the mythics IIRC.
the stats are good but the item effect is horrible on Ahri that's exactly what I'm saying

the pool from her ult will be very small and she has no way to keep people inside so she pretty much only makes uses of the stats with the passive being as good as inexistent,yet it's still better than say ludens which has both good stats and an useful effect

she doesn't make full use of the item and it's still the best option,don't you see the problem?
    I understand what you are saying, but I disagree the effect is horrible on her. Unless I am misunderstanding an interaction here, her ult gets like 3 charges. Each charge fires a few bolts to nearby enemies. If she times her ult and is in a perfect scenario she can proc the pools 9 individual times. That's extra damage for free, as well as MR reduction for anyone in the pools. If she dashed in, landed a charm on you, you are now in a damage circle, with reduced MR against a decently strong burst. 

She may not be constantly procing the pool like Kassadin would, but she still can very easily benefit from the passive, along with the stats. 

Once again, I don't play Ahri, so if her ult doesn't actually proc the passive for someone reason, that's my bad.
        the 3 sec CD usually means she procs it twice at best (even only once per target if she doesn't space a lot between ults,it takes 2 seconds to use all casts for reference),what you're describing is an extremely unlikely scenario

her E makes them walk out of the pool already on its own + you usually either use it before or significantly after proccing malognace

it's not too unusual to get 60 damage or so per solo fight unless they're a sitting duck

it really sounds good on paper but in practice this item is awful on her,besides the broken stats
her best build is malignace lich bane,then rabadons/banshee/void staff or bloom which all seems pretty normal in terms of cost,if you were right we'd see items like Shurelya,Rylai or other pure utility items,instead she always goes for damage/CDR stacking

then again you talk as if literally every single champion in the game doesn't benefit from gold efficiency and tends to build the items that give you the most
    My fault, I should have clarified gold efficient *mage* items, I did in another thread about Ahri but forgot to say it in this comment.


Items like Rabadon's and Lich Bane (or its 2nd damage item equivalent on other champions) are always going to be the highest winrate items, but the very context of their purchase is those champions being ahead enough in the game to justify the purchase to begin with. Items like Rabadon's get picked lower and lower the higher elo you go (but the win rate also goes up, because when you're ahead enough to purchase a high elo player utilizes the spike better) regardless of whatever mage you're playing because the cost is simply not as justifiable in a standard build because of how it slows down your item spikes.

The problem with Ahri is that she can freely opt into low damage builds while simultaneously being able to capitalize on more damage oriented purchases if the game state allows it. Champions like Viktor and Syndra are stuck in a hole where they *have* to build damage because purchasing for example horizon focus 2nd even though it doesn't technically fit with their kit will butcher their usefulness in a game. Ahri can be set behind and not give a single fuck  while also being a total nightmare if she is ahead in any given game.
And half the damage to minions.
L brain, if any.
    Ight I'll entertain you, what exactly bothers you/ do you think is wrong with teemo shrooms in aram?
        No pink wards or oracles anymore. You can't do anything but wait for a cannon minion to come by, which means it's impossible to push even after an ace and it slows the game down a ton. Same issue with shaco.
            Nah the longer the game goes on the more cannons spawn and if you get the inhib teemo becomes considerably weaker than before.
            That's a pretty gross exaggeration of shacos capabilities. Boxes die in 1 auto/ability and aren't able to 1 shot a wave. They also don't stay on map for very long and most a wave will hit 2 or 3. Boxes won't be able to stop a push. As for teems shrooms, what else does teemo do in aram? He blinds and throws shrooms. He doesn't have the same aeo dmg as other mages. He has far less range than other mages and marksmen. He is very squishy, has no cc other than blind. I think it's OK if he kills a wave after he dies.
                Shaco also has a box limit of 6 in aram iirc. Still obnoxious playing against him as a melee/tank since its impossible to engage him without cannon wave but not OP imo
                Sure, Shaco's not as bad and teemo is relatively easy to kill. You asked why people thought teemo wasn't fun to play against in aram, that's why. It's not about winrate, it's that the specific mechanics he relies on aren't fun to play against, at least for me.
                    I think teemos shrooms are actually fun to play against. It's something different that you have to pay attention to. Like a mini game. Plus, should teemo be removed from a specific game mode just because they think it's unfun? Seems like a silly take imo.
            There are infinity cannons in aram…
        The optimal way to use them has become spamming them down the middle of lane where minions come. If your team is pushing, the enemies die if they chase past their own minions at all. If youre being pushed in, it just becomes a game of can the mushrooms stall long enough to get you back in. Either way theyre unfun for all players but the teemo, and even then its not fun putting 90% of them in one place, and thats on an ultimate ability, which are supposed to be the most exciting abilities to use.
        Local man can’t resist the allure of bushes or walking ahead of minions.
..0 damage to minions? It still does enough to wreck waves even after the nerf
    2-3 shrooms for melees isn't really wrecking and certainly not effective or efficient. 
They literally wreck every wave, even if they are seen they still explode on the melee minions. And he can throw them in real time + bounce making them impossible to clear unless you have at least 3 range (still alive and in range to clear them as he drops them).
But I guess if your have the MMR of a clown and you play your ARAM with iron players this probably is not an issue for you. 

Every game against a Teemo is a nightmare to end. You can disagree, but that'd just show how clueless you are. Get rid of them or bring back the oracle elixir.
    > You can disagree, but that'd just show how clueless you are.

Yikes. In all honesty, I fully agree with your overall point about teemo in ARAM, but that's such a shitty attitude to have lol.

"If you disagree with me, it must be because you're stupid. I'm not going to listen to anyone who says anything else!" 

Get it together, bud.
        I would not mind arguing in good faith, but wtf is that :
"They deal like 0 dmg to minions, are easy to clear every other wave... like idk"

Either it's sarcasm, in which case he's missing the /s, either it's not worth talking about/with.

If I told you "Teemo is bad in ARAM because people don't use their ult", you'd be a fool to argue with me. It's pointless and fruitless.

Also, the league of legends subreddit is the last place on the internet I'd think of arguing on, regardless of what you actually say and how well you argue/document your point. People who disagree philosophically will not bother to read/educate themselves and will downvote into oblivion regardless.
    Factually untrue. 2-3 shrooms for melees isn't really wrecking and certainly not effective or efficient. Just shows you don't play the game.
    [49% W/R](https://lolalytics.com/lol/teemo/aram/build/?tier=all). The only rank where he is above 50% is iron, and his W/R falls as rank increases. If you can't win vs teemo on aram then that's on you bro.
>basically undodgeable atomic bombs

RQ may be hard to dodge, but it’s easy to avoid. Karma has absolutely no backline access, so if you just position properly she will never damage you.
    Thats 100% true and 100% irrelevant at the same time depending on what Champion you play. Good luck avoiding a midlane karma hugging her ADC as melee midlaner
        Sure, but there’s plenty of other champs that shit on melee mid laners too. The fact that you get counterpicked sometimes does not make a champion OP.
            I did not say with one word that i think she is OP. I only said that she is absolutly atrocious to play against in mid and she should kindly piss off to botlane. I stand by that still 🤐
People always discredit how much damage Shyvanas ult deals in AP builds

Landing onto squishies with your fly in, is absolutely a core part of her damage. Not just her breath from a distance
    It really depends on what you need to be doing at the current moment. AP Shyv has the ability to seriously chunk and sometimes oneshot enemies from afar, in some situations you're getting more damage from ulting backward because you'll be alive long enough to deal more damage. I can think of a couple champs I'm just not ulting onto as glass cannon AP Shyv.
    Just played with AP Shyv on ARAM that seemed to rely solely on the R damage. She jumped in, almost always landed just on Poppy and Pantheon, promptly died (who would have guessed) and started blaming everyone for not following up.
Karma had an added bonus of also being really fast and healing and shielding a shit ton, which only adds to the frustration of playing against her
Karma is on a hard timer tho compared to Shyv.
Bronze level take
Not my problem if you cant understand English. Both of my sentences are gramatically correct, I havent skipped any necessary stuff. Also not my fault english is too basic and lacks real punctation, which many more complex languages have.
    Ah Look. You are indeed able to form coherent sentences! Congratulation!

*edit also your whole Point is somehow extrapolating my opinion on whole classes of champions from my opinion on one (1) support being absolutly stupid to play against in mid. 

Interesting take to say the least.
        And you are able to read, congrats!

Karma was literally designed to be a midlaner but was pushed out of it like most other mages (zilean, velkoz, brand, zyra). And people always cry that people play mages as supports then people cry when people play mages in their original role. What if people would stop crying if a mage is able to play the game and also carry and not just be a wave clearing slave?
            You are making the biggest strawman Argument ive Seen in a while here. I have Not Said a single word about any mage support other than karma and not a single thing about another midlaner than karma. 

Since you cant stop putting words in my mouth i will just stop responding now. Maybe Go argue with the persons that allegedly hold the opinions you are arguing against, not with someone that has not said a single word of the above.
Yep, that explains the comment and downvotes. I got into a platinum 4 peaker debate. That’s awkward.
    Rude
Serlyda does not scale wtih level, it scales with how much letgality you have
    then maybe make ult cdr scale woth how much regular cdr you have?
        That's tough because I think Ability Haste is already in low supply. Could be wrong, but I see that potentially warping builds around it. It either warps builds or it gets forgotten about.
            It's not in low supply, it's just not on any of the big utility or burst items that make the big numbers happen or stop an enemy's big numbers from happening (BV, Zhonya's, Shadowflame, Stormsurge, Void, and Deathcap).

AA/Seraph's, Malignance, Cosmic Drive, and Luden's all give 25 normal haste. 4 items for 50% CDR is very good if spell slinging is your character's thing. That's a LOT of mana, too. Cryptbloom and Horizon Focus are also really good haste items.
                And out of 3 of those items, you're only building 1 because there's no need for multiple mana items unless you're Ryze
                    You're trading raw damage for cooldowns. No one ever asked if building raw CDR was going to be the optimal choice or whether some stats are wasted. That's irrelevant here. The point is there is a ton of haste available if you want to go that route, and Seraph's makes sure the mana doesn't go completely to waste with a bigger shield and more AP.

We're not talking about need. But it's not like a set like this is bad in and of itself.

Luden/Malignance/seraph (whichever you need/want), Cosmic Drive, Horizon, Cryptbloom, DCap, Sorcs.

That's a total of 85 haste, which is 46% CDR. I honestly don't see the problem here. That's more than was ever achievable before ability haste existed. You can bump that to 50% if you're okay with letting sorcs slide...but probably shouldn't do that.
            Tbf, we really don’t need AH in the game atm. Cooldowns are already so low for most champs that the traditional counterplay of abusing openings is much more restricted. It’s IMO one of the poorer design philosophies Riot has picked up in the recent seasons. 

Everyone talks about the damage being the problem, but I’d prefer high damage rewarding landing skills, but being harshly punished for missing them. Doesn’t feel that way at the moment as rotations come back up pretty quickly.
        That gives it a quadratic scaling which is probably not what you want.

It would have to be balanced around builds with lots of haste, which would make it bad in all other cases.
            idk I was just throwing shit out ngl. Maybe you could give it a RoA type of deal where ult CD goes up per a certain time period to a cap? or give it something like Axiom Arc's passive but touch the numbers a bit and just remove the ult cd altogether? idk I'm literally just spitting out whayever comes to mind lmao
        There's already not a lot of it, and unlike lethality, it gets less effective the more you have
Maybe they should just not make stupid items like this in the first place.

Had high hopes for this season at the start once they removed mythics but Riot cannot take a single step forward without taking 2 steps back.
    The second they announced that shit it was so obvious it would be going down this same path. Riot makes unique item that is overtuned for certain characters>they nerf the character and make them reliant on said items>nerf the item to trash tier dragging the nerfed champs with it.
People are still stuck years ago where 11 and 16 was a gigantic difference in power level. 16 is still a good spike but it's not what it was
    yup, kass comes online with items, not levels (need 11 ofc)

still u get 2,5 sec ult cd without malignance rn at 11 with some haste/Ultimate Hunter
Which is kinda weird, i remember the first times i played ahri a couple seasons ago i needed dematerializer at least on the mages, now q just insta clears them.
    Pretty sure that was the time where every midlaner went demat, so that wasn't just an ahri thing
It’s insane you’re downvoted for this lmao, the reason she’s broken is the threshold for her to full clear a wave with Q got much lower with the AP ratio increase. You’re completely correct and it’s bizarre you have any downvotes for it
Why is this comment downvoted lol? Ahri can just press q+w and be moving to bot/jungle already on any wave that is not cannon, that alone gives her so much pressure that allows her to do whatever she want in the map. Im sure that if ahri didn't have such a strong waveclear so early her winrate would drop even if malignance remains strong.
LegitKorea is who I’m referring too, I might be out of date then
The data is a bit skewed though, the playstyle for Malig first is different.

You likely only fight with your ult if it’s on such a short CD, whereas LB you can be aggro outside of the CD, which is arguably more difficult but could pay off better.
    Yeah  but the problem is that her fighting capabilities with malignance and ult are far superior.

Malignance gives a total of 45 AH to ult. If you get +5 from GM, 50AH translate into 33%CDR, for each 1 min of the ult, she will reduce it by 20 seconds. Consider Ahri's Ult, it's CD are 130/105/80. With malignance + gm now her ult CD is 87/70/53. She can pretty much get this before 11 mins. Now you have to deal with an ahri who can TF way more often. Outside malignance  she would need at least 2 items to achieve the same spam capability. God forbid she gets vantage in lane and she gets more items early, from lvl 11 onwards it becomes toxic getting sniped that easy. She will be able to use her ult just to kill you without i
objectives on map just because she can B, get back with more items and have her ult ON again.
    I have no idea why you’re mentioning LB to support Malignance data being off FOR AHRI which it should not be. Lolanalytics also puts put their methodology and it looks pretty solid to me. 

I have no opinion on what Malignance is like for champs that aren’t Ahri but for her the CDR on Ult gives her a cycle of 3+ dashes w/ passive damage that can proc her Lich Bane auto while she weaves in QWE.
        …..LB is LichBane shortened….. figured that would be obvious in the context of “items on Ahri”.

I’m just saying Malignance playstyle is different than Luden’s into Lich.
            OH! My mind immediately went to LeBlanc (probably because I used to OTP her a few years back). 

Also to clarify, I was saying Malignance INTO Lich Bane not necessarily Malignance is better than Lich Bane. Even though I think both Mal into LB and Mal > LB are both best/true atm.
                That’s definitely fair lol, I know it’s the same acronym for both, I coulda just said Lich like I did in the second response I guess :p

It’s really good on Ahri, even the damage is decent, I just tend to assume a 120AP item could outperform it in some situations, and if you’re going to take Luden’s you don’t need the extra mana > AP.
The data supports that there is very little to no difference between Malignance and other builds. It definitely isn't even 1% over ludens or something.

It's really not at all the reason Ahri gets nerfed or w/e. People acting like Ahri is the same as Teemo is crazy.
i think you are confused grandpa the op of this said championS not arhi
it was clearly a continuation of my original point
No but the context for them does. Just fucking remove the ability haste from maligma
    Buffs compound regardless. I agree that Malignance is overpowered but Ahri is also overtuned right now.
Ahri is not blind pickable. People keep saying that when she has straight counters Lock in Zed, Akali,Yasuo and she's in for a rough time.
    low elo ahri abuser detected, none of those are counters. and she doesnt have any real counter as she can neutralise any bad lane
        Sorry to break it to you 90% of the game is played in low elo not high elo. And the low elo is what brings in the money.
            Yes and high elo is what is balanced around 99% of the time. So whats the point in even bringing low elo up in a balance discussion? Almost never is a change aimed for them because things like meta don't even matter down there.
            People in low elo are humans who are capable of learning. It might take them a little longer, but they do it all the time. So if the reason something is strong or weak in low elo is lack of knowledge on the player's part, it is reasonable to ask that player to just learn.
    Ahri is very blind pickable, she’s good into zed and can control the wave easily against Akali/zed, she may struggle with yasuo but even then can still waveclear with no threat. She’s safe as hell with great waveclear and decent ways to lane into melee and ranged. Shes the definition of blind pickable
    Ahri wins or goes even in all of these matchups. Like you could not have picked worst champions to suggest as counters.
    ? not a single one of those champs give ahri a rough time.

she wins at least 51% of the time against every one of those champs if you look at the stats alone.

And just based of me playing ahri. None of those champs provide any problems in the slightest
        I agree with you but I also want to point out that a lot of these champions have less than 50% win rates because they’re mechanically intensive. So using statistics to determine what “should” happen might be a bit skewed because on average people are losing on these champs which makes ahri look better into them. (She’s still good into all of them, I just don’t love the Winrate metric)
            well neither do I usually but if the stats are 51-55% wr in pretty much all ranks, its a safe argument to make in my book.

 I should think that the ahris and zeds in master rank at least know how their champs work, yet its still almost 55% wr to ahri
                That’s fair! I think you’re right!
Shes an "assassin" with amazing wave clear and self sustain in lane.

no other assassin has that in an even game state, she shouldnt do as much dmg as assassins.

The reason she is nr 1 right now is because she can do assassin shit while have an extremely safe laning phase and managing 10/cs a min AND following roams, initiating roams and pulling off side lane ganks
    She’s not even number 1. Idk where this comes froms. She’s not the number 1 midlaner and all assassins out damage her. 

Ahri has good wave clear good roam and a great mobility but that’s where it ends. 

She’s literally rank 20 on LoL Analytics. 
Ahri is just the most popular midlaner because she’s 1. Cute 2 fox girl  3. Faker
        Shes rank 3 on lol analytics

Shes nr 1 on numerous high elo tier lists.

Also youre quoting third party stat sites but you still considering yasuo, akali, zed hard counters despite them saying otherwise? nothing youre saying makes sense mate, sorry
10% since her q has two dmg instances also she got an old e-CD nerf reverted on 14.2 aditionally it probably also helped that riot buffed malignance by 5AH in 14.4 and made it cheaper in 14.3.     
The cumulative amounts of buffs she and her items needed is honestly a testament to how shit they were.
    At the same time, Stormsurge also got nerfed 3 patches in a row from 14.1 hot fix to 14.3. This is also probably a reason as her matchups changed.
While this makes sense and would make them less usefull, Syndra's ult hits quite fast so I think most of it would still hit in the tiny field (at least on the edge of the field from each orb). But I may be wrong in that regard
    The orbs would all benefit from the bonus but you’d end up losing a lot of the AOE value from it. They’d take maybe 50(?) damage from Malignance puddle and the rest of your combo with Ult-start likely wouldn’t benefit from it.
        Maybe I played her wrong for the most part, but I usually ended the combo/skrimish with ult, but regardless, you are right that it wouldnt give enough value and certainly not for other skills. I wasnt saying that Malignance was significantly good on Syndra as I havent played her much since the changes and didnt look at the statistics, was just proposing that it is not as unusable as the original comment said.
It's mind-boggling how long it took for them to nerf Sunderer and even this new iteration of Sunderer is only being properly nerfed now in pbe despite it being so centralising.
    Yep, i dont play on pc anymore, but every support I play on wildrift builds titanic hydra & sunderer. If I played PC, I'd absolutely build sunderer on bard too it's just THAT good. Granted, I played bard as a tank, not an enchanter or "mage"
        Doesn't really work on PC, supports just don't really have the gold to get both titanic and sundered in a reasonable time frame. Supports usually sit on support item +1 completed item for awhile unless they snowball hard. This is especially the case for bruiser items as they tend to be pricier than support items by a significant margin (3300/3100 for titanic/sundered)
            Well.. top laners sit on two completed items for a while unless they snowball, too. Should they stop building bruisers' items, too? Jugglers sit on completed jungle item +1 completed item for a while as well. Should they stop building bruisers' items, too? Yes, it'll take longer to complete them. But if you're paying attention to the game state and your gold gain consistency across matches, you can easily adjust your playstyle and build order to better accommodate varying factors in the gold "deficit" that supports apparently have
                Top laners still consistently are getting gold to build more items. If supports and top laners build the same items, top laners will be building them significantly faster. (also many bruiser items scale well with base stats/champ level, which top laners will have more of).

Bruiser items frankly aren't that amazing when you are behind in items, but are really strong when you are ahead compared to any other class.

Theres also a big difference between titanic + sundered compared to like solstice sleigh + sundered.

There's a reason there are 0 supports right now that build bruiser items outside of camille (who isn't doing so hot since nerfs to bloodsong). And camille is mostly there because she abuses bloodsong harder than any other champ (best sheen user in the game)
except that for the ones who can build them current liandry + riftbaker are far worse than old liandry (+ demonic)

the only difference is that the mages who actually struggle against tanks have no option left
    Classically, tanks are supposed to counter mages for the most part. It was part of the reason the adc role existed was to kill tanks.

And idk, as much as gwen/morde is a pain to deal with as tanks, that is also heavily because of their kit (and I'd still rather play against them than play tanks on mythic item patches)
        liandry mostly helped to deal with bruisers,tanks stacking MR never really suffered from it

and while I agree on what you said there is a difference between being countered and having an hopeless matchup,liandry ensured it was only the latter

point is liandry was never problematic on the champion you are afraid would become too strong against tanks with it
            I disagree that liandries is decent into bruisers or tanks for that matter. I think wed see alot more mages top and mages splitpushing into enemy toplaners if it was. But we dont cause mages dont have the initial burst to kill through bruiser items and dont have the mobility to survive extended fights where liandries would see value.
            To an extent yes, however during mythic items, there wasn't much MR for tanks to build. Most of the MR items gave like 40 MR, and none of them were first items (only jak'sho had MR for first tank item). It's why rumble, despite getting much better liandry's and more anti-tank damage in his kit is largely performing much worse into tanks this season relatively.

As a tank player at least, it is far less painful to play into magic damage now, and you are drastically tankier (unless it's like brand/lillia/asol or some other %hp magic damage champ that also build liandrys)
I wonder if riot plans to change zed’s kit?
Sure, but it is in a state considerably weakened. And I don't think Stride removed the counterplay in the way you mean unless you are talking about the time when it had that dash, which point I'd agree totally.

I don't think Gore defines gameplay to a lesser extent than nerfed Stride or Malignance does if the former were to be nerfed in the manner items like Stride or Liandry were to.
    I have no idea what you’re talking about.

Stride rewards champs that want to stay close to you by slowing you, making it harder to get away - before this state, it gave you a dash which was broken and had to be removed.

I don’t understand what you mean with „weakend state“ it’s exactly the same as last seasons stride.

Gore defined your gameplay. You became a drain tank when you bought it, even though you weren’t supposed to be one. It changed your gameplay like old stride or galeforce by giving you tools that you weren’t supposed to have.

Malignance only makes your ult stronger just like Rabadons makes your abilities stronger. Everyone who likes to ult buys that item. Even malzahar, even though you named him in champs that don’t want to buy it (no idea why, it’s his most purchased item)

Liandries is supposed to be an anti tank item that also compliments champs that have dps in their kit.
        Agreein with you here, just clarifying


Stride helps you stick to people, not aproach people. It is there so that once you get close to someone, they cant get away. It doesnt help you get in if your champ can't do it already.

Something like gore made champs who couldnt normally sustain on longer fights be able to. Sundered sky does the same now too. They patch a weakness instead of amplifying your strenght
            Yea this
        > I don’t understand what you mean with „weakend state“ it’s exactly the same as last seasons stride.

No? It's slow is weaker considerably compared to it's mythic version, to the point where they had to go around and buff champs like Garen and Darius who used it who were now in the dumpster. It used to deal 175% total AD with a 40% slow for 3 seconds, not it deals %80 AD with a 35% slow that decays over 3 seconds, on top of having overall lower stats and not having haste anymore. 

> Gore defined your gameplay. You became a drain tank when you bought it, even though you weren’t supposed to be one. It changed your gameplay like old stride or galeforce by giving you tools that you weren’t supposed to have. 

Not really. Most of the champs who bought it were those who wanted to slug around in middle of the fight, those with both innate sustain or other means of surviving in the fight. It didn't change the fundamental gameplay of any champion outside of the situations where it was so strong that it could have the gameplay defining effect you describe, but those situations were short and were taken care of by Riot quickly.

> Even malzahar, even though you named him in champs that don’t want to buy it (no idea why, it’s his most purchased item)

He buys it, but he doesn't want to. Right now the optimal build, in terms of damage and utility, is manaless build of Liandry into Rylai into whatever, but because Malz cannot go manaless like Swain, Brand, etc. can, he HAS to buy Malignance. This is why Malz is much weaker this season compared to previous one, why his winrate fell by 2 percent, and why a Rioter came to Malz mains discord and asked his mains their opinions about changes they would make.

> Liandries is supposed to be an anti tank item that also compliments champs that have dps in their kit. 

Okay? That's not my point. My point is that I don't believe Gore would be that egregious if it's passive was nerfed considerably in the same way Stride and Liandry were nerfed to get in line as a legendary item.
> The truth is that it's an ultimate haste item.

It's an ultimate haste item but in a really wonky way, where it's good if you can use it to either spam your spammable ult more or if you can be like Ahri and abuse the ulti haste in a way where your ult can have almost no cooldown at all at later levels. 

I thought mage mythics were decent last season, and I definitely enjoyed the aspect of almost every mage having at least 3 different mythic options they could switch around to decent enough satisfaction depending on the situation. It was certainly better than our current situation of having to choose between different types of meh.

This is absolutely not my experience. Ludens by default is what I remember.
        Nah there were plenty of Liandry users (Viktor this season for instance is feeling shitty due to the loss of liandry mythic) or crown users. Lots of ROA users too (anivia, ryze, swain depending on game etc). As lux there were plenty of games where it was good to go either ludens or liandry
            Liandry users picked their Liandry and never looked at other items. Same with RoA users. If you weren't one of those, it was Ludens and you weren't excited about it. So Ludens by default.
                > Liandry users picked their Liandry and never looked at other items.

Swain could and would go Luden's into certain teams regularly. Similarly Cass could easily go Liandry into certain teams.
                    Swain could and would go liandries, ludens, and ROA lol.
                "ludens by default except for all the mages who didn't use Ludens which was probably more than half"
                    Well yes, that's the concept of default. If you had anything especially synergistic with your kit you'd pick that and you'd end up with Ludens if you didn't, which felt back. The new situation is exactly the same thing but with Malignance as one of the synergy options. They didn't solve anything for the champs that unhappily ended up buying Ludens but they also didn't make anything worse either. The situation being your kit picking the mana item for you or having to pick an unexciting one was already there.
                ? I don't know what elo you're in but there were a huge number of mages who could swap between Luden's and Liandry's last season, and you didn't need to have a special synergy to want Liandry's either. It was a common choice even on champions like Syndra, who made a decision between that and Luden's based on how squishy the enemy comp was and how much they needed the haste in a particular game.

The number of mages who were hard-locked into Luden's by lack of other options was extremely small. Almost every mage could opt into Liandry's if they felt like it.
                Syndra could go both
        My experience was that, which maybe skewed because I play these tanky battlemages like Swain, Vlad, Cass etc was that a lot of popular mages like Ori, Syndra, Viktor, Xerath etc. could opt for Liandry if there were enough health stackers because they got really good mileage out of the damage amp from bonus health, which at times could give up to 10 percent bonus damage on all damage. I would also regularly see some of them take Crown if the situation permitted it.
I understand what you are saying, but I disagree the effect is horrible on her. Unless I am misunderstanding an interaction here, her ult gets like 3 charges. Each charge fires a few bolts to nearby enemies. If she times her ult and is in a perfect scenario she can proc the pools 9 individual times. That's extra damage for free, as well as MR reduction for anyone in the pools. If she dashed in, landed a charm on you, you are now in a damage circle, with reduced MR against a decently strong burst. 

She may not be constantly procing the pool like Kassadin would, but she still can very easily benefit from the passive, along with the stats. 

Once again, I don't play Ahri, so if her ult doesn't actually proc the passive for someone reason, that's my bad.
    the 3 sec CD usually means she procs it twice at best (even only once per target if she doesn't space a lot between ults,it takes 2 seconds to use all casts for reference),what you're describing is an extremely unlikely scenario

her E makes them walk out of the pool already on its own + you usually either use it before or significantly after proccing malognace

it's not too unusual to get 60 damage or so per solo fight unless they're a sitting duck

it really sounds good on paper but in practice this item is awful on her,besides the broken stats
My fault, I should have clarified gold efficient *mage* items, I did in another thread about Ahri but forgot to say it in this comment.


Items like Rabadon's and Lich Bane (or its 2nd damage item equivalent on other champions) are always going to be the highest winrate items, but the very context of their purchase is those champions being ahead enough in the game to justify the purchase to begin with. Items like Rabadon's get picked lower and lower the higher elo you go (but the win rate also goes up, because when you're ahead enough to purchase a high elo player utilizes the spike better) regardless of whatever mage you're playing because the cost is simply not as justifiable in a standard build because of how it slows down your item spikes.

The problem with Ahri is that she can freely opt into low damage builds while simultaneously being able to capitalize on more damage oriented purchases if the game state allows it. Champions like Viktor and Syndra are stuck in a hole where they *have* to build damage because purchasing for example horizon focus 2nd even though it doesn't technically fit with their kit will butcher their usefulness in a game. Ahri can be set behind and not give a single fuck  while also being a total nightmare if she is ahead in any given game.
Ight I'll entertain you, what exactly bothers you/ do you think is wrong with teemo shrooms in aram?
    No pink wards or oracles anymore. You can't do anything but wait for a cannon minion to come by, which means it's impossible to push even after an ace and it slows the game down a ton. Same issue with shaco.
        Nah the longer the game goes on the more cannons spawn and if you get the inhib teemo becomes considerably weaker than before.
        That's a pretty gross exaggeration of shacos capabilities. Boxes die in 1 auto/ability and aren't able to 1 shot a wave. They also don't stay on map for very long and most a wave will hit 2 or 3. Boxes won't be able to stop a push. As for teems shrooms, what else does teemo do in aram? He blinds and throws shrooms. He doesn't have the same aeo dmg as other mages. He has far less range than other mages and marksmen. He is very squishy, has no cc other than blind. I think it's OK if he kills a wave after he dies.
            Shaco also has a box limit of 6 in aram iirc. Still obnoxious playing against him as a melee/tank since its impossible to engage him without cannon wave but not OP imo
            Sure, Shaco's not as bad and teemo is relatively easy to kill. You asked why people thought teemo wasn't fun to play against in aram, that's why. It's not about winrate, it's that the specific mechanics he relies on aren't fun to play against, at least for me.
                I think teemos shrooms are actually fun to play against. It's something different that you have to pay attention to. Like a mini game. Plus, should teemo be removed from a specific game mode just because they think it's unfun? Seems like a silly take imo.
        There are infinity cannons in aram…
    The optimal way to use them has become spamming them down the middle of lane where minions come. If your team is pushing, the enemies die if they chase past their own minions at all. If youre being pushed in, it just becomes a game of can the mushrooms stall long enough to get you back in. Either way theyre unfun for all players but the teemo, and even then its not fun putting 90% of them in one place, and thats on an ultimate ability, which are supposed to be the most exciting abilities to use.
    Local man can’t resist the allure of bushes or walking ahead of minions.
2-3 shrooms for melees isn't really wrecking and certainly not effective or efficient. 
> You can disagree, but that'd just show how clueless you are.

Yikes. In all honesty, I fully agree with your overall point about teemo in ARAM, but that's such a shitty attitude to have lol.

"If you disagree with me, it must be because you're stupid. I'm not going to listen to anyone who says anything else!" 

Get it together, bud.
    I would not mind arguing in good faith, but wtf is that :
"They deal like 0 dmg to minions, are easy to clear every other wave... like idk"

Either it's sarcasm, in which case he's missing the /s, either it's not worth talking about/with.

If I told you "Teemo is bad in ARAM because people don't use their ult", you'd be a fool to argue with me. It's pointless and fruitless.

Also, the league of legends subreddit is the last place on the internet I'd think of arguing on, regardless of what you actually say and how well you argue/document your point. People who disagree philosophically will not bother to read/educate themselves and will downvote into oblivion regardless.
Factually untrue. 2-3 shrooms for melees isn't really wrecking and certainly not effective or efficient. Just shows you don't play the game.
[49% W/R](https://lolalytics.com/lol/teemo/aram/build/?tier=all). The only rank where he is above 50% is iron, and his W/R falls as rank increases. If you can't win vs teemo on aram then that's on you bro.
Thats 100% true and 100% irrelevant at the same time depending on what Champion you play. Good luck avoiding a midlane karma hugging her ADC as melee midlaner
    Sure, but there’s plenty of other champs that shit on melee mid laners too. The fact that you get counterpicked sometimes does not make a champion OP.
        I did not say with one word that i think she is OP. I only said that she is absolutly atrocious to play against in mid and she should kindly piss off to botlane. I stand by that still 🤐
It really depends on what you need to be doing at the current moment. AP Shyv has the ability to seriously chunk and sometimes oneshot enemies from afar, in some situations you're getting more damage from ulting backward because you'll be alive long enough to deal more damage. I can think of a couple champs I'm just not ulting onto as glass cannon AP Shyv.
Just played with AP Shyv on ARAM that seemed to rely solely on the R damage. She jumped in, almost always landed just on Poppy and Pantheon, promptly died (who would have guessed) and started blaming everyone for not following up.
Ah Look. You are indeed able to form coherent sentences! Congratulation!

*edit also your whole Point is somehow extrapolating my opinion on whole classes of champions from my opinion on one (1) support being absolutly stupid to play against in mid. 

Interesting take to say the least.
    And you are able to read, congrats!

Karma was literally designed to be a midlaner but was pushed out of it like most other mages (zilean, velkoz, brand, zyra). And people always cry that people play mages as supports then people cry when people play mages in their original role. What if people would stop crying if a mage is able to play the game and also carry and not just be a wave clearing slave?
        You are making the biggest strawman Argument ive Seen in a while here. I have Not Said a single word about any mage support other than karma and not a single thing about another midlaner than karma. 

Since you cant stop putting words in my mouth i will just stop responding now. Maybe Go argue with the persons that allegedly hold the opinions you are arguing against, not with someone that has not said a single word of the above.
Rude
then maybe make ult cdr scale woth how much regular cdr you have?
    That's tough because I think Ability Haste is already in low supply. Could be wrong, but I see that potentially warping builds around it. It either warps builds or it gets forgotten about.
        It's not in low supply, it's just not on any of the big utility or burst items that make the big numbers happen or stop an enemy's big numbers from happening (BV, Zhonya's, Shadowflame, Stormsurge, Void, and Deathcap).

AA/Seraph's, Malignance, Cosmic Drive, and Luden's all give 25 normal haste. 4 items for 50% CDR is very good if spell slinging is your character's thing. That's a LOT of mana, too. Cryptbloom and Horizon Focus are also really good haste items.
            And out of 3 of those items, you're only building 1 because there's no need for multiple mana items unless you're Ryze
                You're trading raw damage for cooldowns. No one ever asked if building raw CDR was going to be the optimal choice or whether some stats are wasted. That's irrelevant here. The point is there is a ton of haste available if you want to go that route, and Seraph's makes sure the mana doesn't go completely to waste with a bigger shield and more AP.

We're not talking about need. But it's not like a set like this is bad in and of itself.

Luden/Malignance/seraph (whichever you need/want), Cosmic Drive, Horizon, Cryptbloom, DCap, Sorcs.

That's a total of 85 haste, which is 46% CDR. I honestly don't see the problem here. That's more than was ever achievable before ability haste existed. You can bump that to 50% if you're okay with letting sorcs slide...but probably shouldn't do that.
        Tbf, we really don’t need AH in the game atm. Cooldowns are already so low for most champs that the traditional counterplay of abusing openings is much more restricted. It’s IMO one of the poorer design philosophies Riot has picked up in the recent seasons. 

Everyone talks about the damage being the problem, but I’d prefer high damage rewarding landing skills, but being harshly punished for missing them. Doesn’t feel that way at the moment as rotations come back up pretty quickly.
    That gives it a quadratic scaling which is probably not what you want.

It would have to be balanced around builds with lots of haste, which would make it bad in all other cases.
        idk I was just throwing shit out ngl. Maybe you could give it a RoA type of deal where ult CD goes up per a certain time period to a cap? or give it something like Axiom Arc's passive but touch the numbers a bit and just remove the ult cd altogether? idk I'm literally just spitting out whayever comes to mind lmao
    There's already not a lot of it, and unlike lethality, it gets less effective the more you have
The second they announced that shit it was so obvious it would be going down this same path. Riot makes unique item that is overtuned for certain characters>they nerf the character and make them reliant on said items>nerf the item to trash tier dragging the nerfed champs with it.
yup, kass comes online with items, not levels (need 11 ofc)

still u get 2,5 sec ult cd without malignance rn at 11 with some haste/Ultimate Hunter
Pretty sure that was the time where every midlaner went demat, so that wasn't just an ahri thing
Yeah  but the problem is that her fighting capabilities with malignance and ult are far superior.

Malignance gives a total of 45 AH to ult. If you get +5 from GM, 50AH translate into 33%CDR, for each 1 min of the ult, she will reduce it by 20 seconds. Consider Ahri's Ult, it's CD are 130/105/80. With malignance + gm now her ult CD is 87/70/53. She can pretty much get this before 11 mins. Now you have to deal with an ahri who can TF way more often. Outside malignance  she would need at least 2 items to achieve the same spam capability. God forbid she gets vantage in lane and she gets more items early, from lvl 11 onwards it becomes toxic getting sniped that easy. She will be able to use her ult just to kill you without i
objectives on map just because she can B, get back with more items and have her ult ON again.
I have no idea why you’re mentioning LB to support Malignance data being off FOR AHRI which it should not be. Lolanalytics also puts put their methodology and it looks pretty solid to me. 

I have no opinion on what Malignance is like for champs that aren’t Ahri but for her the CDR on Ult gives her a cycle of 3+ dashes w/ passive damage that can proc her Lich Bane auto while she weaves in QWE.
    …..LB is LichBane shortened….. figured that would be obvious in the context of “items on Ahri”.

I’m just saying Malignance playstyle is different than Luden’s into Lich.
        OH! My mind immediately went to LeBlanc (probably because I used to OTP her a few years back). 

Also to clarify, I was saying Malignance INTO Lich Bane not necessarily Malignance is better than Lich Bane. Even though I think both Mal into LB and Mal > LB are both best/true atm.
            That’s definitely fair lol, I know it’s the same acronym for both, I coulda just said Lich like I did in the second response I guess :p

It’s really good on Ahri, even the damage is decent, I just tend to assume a 120AP item could outperform it in some situations, and if you’re going to take Luden’s you don’t need the extra mana > AP.
Buffs compound regardless. I agree that Malignance is overpowered but Ahri is also overtuned right now.
low elo ahri abuser detected, none of those are counters. and she doesnt have any real counter as she can neutralise any bad lane
    Sorry to break it to you 90% of the game is played in low elo not high elo. And the low elo is what brings in the money.
        Yes and high elo is what is balanced around 99% of the time. So whats the point in even bringing low elo up in a balance discussion? Almost never is a change aimed for them because things like meta don't even matter down there.
        People in low elo are humans who are capable of learning. It might take them a little longer, but they do it all the time. So if the reason something is strong or weak in low elo is lack of knowledge on the player's part, it is reasonable to ask that player to just learn.
Ahri is very blind pickable, she’s good into zed and can control the wave easily against Akali/zed, she may struggle with yasuo but even then can still waveclear with no threat. She’s safe as hell with great waveclear and decent ways to lane into melee and ranged. Shes the definition of blind pickable
Ahri wins or goes even in all of these matchups. Like you could not have picked worst champions to suggest as counters.
? not a single one of those champs give ahri a rough time.

she wins at least 51% of the time against every one of those champs if you look at the stats alone.

And just based of me playing ahri. None of those champs provide any problems in the slightest
    I agree with you but I also want to point out that a lot of these champions have less than 50% win rates because they’re mechanically intensive. So using statistics to determine what “should” happen might be a bit skewed because on average people are losing on these champs which makes ahri look better into them. (She’s still good into all of them, I just don’t love the Winrate metric)
        well neither do I usually but if the stats are 51-55% wr in pretty much all ranks, its a safe argument to make in my book.

 I should think that the ahris and zeds in master rank at least know how their champs work, yet its still almost 55% wr to ahri
            That’s fair! I think you’re right!
She’s not even number 1. Idk where this comes froms. She’s not the number 1 midlaner and all assassins out damage her. 

Ahri has good wave clear good roam and a great mobility but that’s where it ends. 

She’s literally rank 20 on LoL Analytics. 
Ahri is just the most popular midlaner because she’s 1. Cute 2 fox girl  3. Faker
    Shes rank 3 on lol analytics

Shes nr 1 on numerous high elo tier lists.

Also youre quoting third party stat sites but you still considering yasuo, akali, zed hard counters despite them saying otherwise? nothing youre saying makes sense mate, sorry
At the same time, Stormsurge also got nerfed 3 patches in a row from 14.1 hot fix to 14.3. This is also probably a reason as her matchups changed.
The orbs would all benefit from the bonus but you’d end up losing a lot of the AOE value from it. They’d take maybe 50(?) damage from Malignance puddle and the rest of your combo with Ult-start likely wouldn’t benefit from it.
    Maybe I played her wrong for the most part, but I usually ended the combo/skrimish with ult, but regardless, you are right that it wouldnt give enough value and certainly not for other skills. I wasnt saying that Malignance was significantly good on Syndra as I havent played her much since the changes and didnt look at the statistics, was just proposing that it is not as unusable as the original comment said.
Yep, i dont play on pc anymore, but every support I play on wildrift builds titanic hydra & sunderer. If I played PC, I'd absolutely build sunderer on bard too it's just THAT good. Granted, I played bard as a tank, not an enchanter or "mage"
    Doesn't really work on PC, supports just don't really have the gold to get both titanic and sundered in a reasonable time frame. Supports usually sit on support item +1 completed item for awhile unless they snowball hard. This is especially the case for bruiser items as they tend to be pricier than support items by a significant margin (3300/3100 for titanic/sundered)
        Well.. top laners sit on two completed items for a while unless they snowball, too. Should they stop building bruisers' items, too? Jugglers sit on completed jungle item +1 completed item for a while as well. Should they stop building bruisers' items, too? Yes, it'll take longer to complete them. But if you're paying attention to the game state and your gold gain consistency across matches, you can easily adjust your playstyle and build order to better accommodate varying factors in the gold "deficit" that supports apparently have
            Top laners still consistently are getting gold to build more items. If supports and top laners build the same items, top laners will be building them significantly faster. (also many bruiser items scale well with base stats/champ level, which top laners will have more of).

Bruiser items frankly aren't that amazing when you are behind in items, but are really strong when you are ahead compared to any other class.

Theres also a big difference between titanic + sundered compared to like solstice sleigh + sundered.

There's a reason there are 0 supports right now that build bruiser items outside of camille (who isn't doing so hot since nerfs to bloodsong). And camille is mostly there because she abuses bloodsong harder than any other champ (best sheen user in the game)
Classically, tanks are supposed to counter mages for the most part. It was part of the reason the adc role existed was to kill tanks.

And idk, as much as gwen/morde is a pain to deal with as tanks, that is also heavily because of their kit (and I'd still rather play against them than play tanks on mythic item patches)
    liandry mostly helped to deal with bruisers,tanks stacking MR never really suffered from it

and while I agree on what you said there is a difference between being countered and having an hopeless matchup,liandry ensured it was only the latter

point is liandry was never problematic on the champion you are afraid would become too strong against tanks with it
        I disagree that liandries is decent into bruisers or tanks for that matter. I think wed see alot more mages top and mages splitpushing into enemy toplaners if it was. But we dont cause mages dont have the initial burst to kill through bruiser items and dont have the mobility to survive extended fights where liandries would see value.
        To an extent yes, however during mythic items, there wasn't much MR for tanks to build. Most of the MR items gave like 40 MR, and none of them were first items (only jak'sho had MR for first tank item). It's why rumble, despite getting much better liandry's and more anti-tank damage in his kit is largely performing much worse into tanks this season relatively.

As a tank player at least, it is far less painful to play into magic damage now, and you are drastically tankier (unless it's like brand/lillia/asol or some other %hp magic damage champ that also build liandrys)
I have no idea what you’re talking about.

Stride rewards champs that want to stay close to you by slowing you, making it harder to get away - before this state, it gave you a dash which was broken and had to be removed.

I don’t understand what you mean with „weakend state“ it’s exactly the same as last seasons stride.

Gore defined your gameplay. You became a drain tank when you bought it, even though you weren’t supposed to be one. It changed your gameplay like old stride or galeforce by giving you tools that you weren’t supposed to have.

Malignance only makes your ult stronger just like Rabadons makes your abilities stronger. Everyone who likes to ult buys that item. Even malzahar, even though you named him in champs that don’t want to buy it (no idea why, it’s his most purchased item)

Liandries is supposed to be an anti tank item that also compliments champs that have dps in their kit.
    Agreein with you here, just clarifying


Stride helps you stick to people, not aproach people. It is there so that once you get close to someone, they cant get away. It doesnt help you get in if your champ can't do it already.

Something like gore made champs who couldnt normally sustain on longer fights be able to. Sundered sky does the same now too. They patch a weakness instead of amplifying your strenght
        Yea this
    > I don’t understand what you mean with „weakend state“ it’s exactly the same as last seasons stride.

No? It's slow is weaker considerably compared to it's mythic version, to the point where they had to go around and buff champs like Garen and Darius who used it who were now in the dumpster. It used to deal 175% total AD with a 40% slow for 3 seconds, not it deals %80 AD with a 35% slow that decays over 3 seconds, on top of having overall lower stats and not having haste anymore. 

> Gore defined your gameplay. You became a drain tank when you bought it, even though you weren’t supposed to be one. It changed your gameplay like old stride or galeforce by giving you tools that you weren’t supposed to have. 

Not really. Most of the champs who bought it were those who wanted to slug around in middle of the fight, those with both innate sustain or other means of surviving in the fight. It didn't change the fundamental gameplay of any champion outside of the situations where it was so strong that it could have the gameplay defining effect you describe, but those situations were short and were taken care of by Riot quickly.

> Even malzahar, even though you named him in champs that don’t want to buy it (no idea why, it’s his most purchased item)

He buys it, but he doesn't want to. Right now the optimal build, in terms of damage and utility, is manaless build of Liandry into Rylai into whatever, but because Malz cannot go manaless like Swain, Brand, etc. can, he HAS to buy Malignance. This is why Malz is much weaker this season compared to previous one, why his winrate fell by 2 percent, and why a Rioter came to Malz mains discord and asked his mains their opinions about changes they would make.

> Liandries is supposed to be an anti tank item that also compliments champs that have dps in their kit. 

Okay? That's not my point. My point is that I don't believe Gore would be that egregious if it's passive was nerfed considerably in the same way Stride and Liandry were nerfed to get in line as a legendary item.
> I thought mage mythics were decent last season, and I definitely enjoyed the aspect of almost every mage having at least 3 different mythic options they could switch around to decent enough satisfaction depending on the situation. It was certainly better than our current situation of having to choose between different types of meh.

This is absolutely not my experience. Ludens by default is what I remember.
    Nah there were plenty of Liandry users (Viktor this season for instance is feeling shitty due to the loss of liandry mythic) or crown users. Lots of ROA users too (anivia, ryze, swain depending on game etc). As lux there were plenty of games where it was good to go either ludens or liandry
        Liandry users picked their Liandry and never looked at other items. Same with RoA users. If you weren't one of those, it was Ludens and you weren't excited about it. So Ludens by default.
            > Liandry users picked their Liandry and never looked at other items.

Swain could and would go Luden's into certain teams regularly. Similarly Cass could easily go Liandry into certain teams.
                Swain could and would go liandries, ludens, and ROA lol.
            "ludens by default except for all the mages who didn't use Ludens which was probably more than half"
                Well yes, that's the concept of default. If you had anything especially synergistic with your kit you'd pick that and you'd end up with Ludens if you didn't, which felt back. The new situation is exactly the same thing but with Malignance as one of the synergy options. They didn't solve anything for the champs that unhappily ended up buying Ludens but they also didn't make anything worse either. The situation being your kit picking the mana item for you or having to pick an unexciting one was already there.
            ? I don't know what elo you're in but there were a huge number of mages who could swap between Luden's and Liandry's last season, and you didn't need to have a special synergy to want Liandry's either. It was a common choice even on champions like Syndra, who made a decision between that and Luden's based on how squishy the enemy comp was and how much they needed the haste in a particular game.

The number of mages who were hard-locked into Luden's by lack of other options was extremely small. Almost every mage could opt into Liandry's if they felt like it.
            Syndra could go both
    My experience was that, which maybe skewed because I play these tanky battlemages like Swain, Vlad, Cass etc was that a lot of popular mages like Ori, Syndra, Viktor, Xerath etc. could opt for Liandry if there were enough health stackers because they got really good mileage out of the damage amp from bonus health, which at times could give up to 10 percent bonus damage on all damage. I would also regularly see some of them take Crown if the situation permitted it.
the 3 sec CD usually means she procs it twice at best (even only once per target if she doesn't space a lot between ults,it takes 2 seconds to use all casts for reference),what you're describing is an extremely unlikely scenario

her E makes them walk out of the pool already on its own + you usually either use it before or significantly after proccing malognace

it's not too unusual to get 60 damage or so per solo fight unless they're a sitting duck

it really sounds good on paper but in practice this item is awful on her,besides the broken stats
No pink wards or oracles anymore. You can't do anything but wait for a cannon minion to come by, which means it's impossible to push even after an ace and it slows the game down a ton. Same issue with shaco.
    Nah the longer the game goes on the more cannons spawn and if you get the inhib teemo becomes considerably weaker than before.
    That's a pretty gross exaggeration of shacos capabilities. Boxes die in 1 auto/ability and aren't able to 1 shot a wave. They also don't stay on map for very long and most a wave will hit 2 or 3. Boxes won't be able to stop a push. As for teems shrooms, what else does teemo do in aram? He blinds and throws shrooms. He doesn't have the same aeo dmg as other mages. He has far less range than other mages and marksmen. He is very squishy, has no cc other than blind. I think it's OK if he kills a wave after he dies.
        Shaco also has a box limit of 6 in aram iirc. Still obnoxious playing against him as a melee/tank since its impossible to engage him without cannon wave but not OP imo
        Sure, Shaco's not as bad and teemo is relatively easy to kill. You asked why people thought teemo wasn't fun to play against in aram, that's why. It's not about winrate, it's that the specific mechanics he relies on aren't fun to play against, at least for me.
            I think teemos shrooms are actually fun to play against. It's something different that you have to pay attention to. Like a mini game. Plus, should teemo be removed from a specific game mode just because they think it's unfun? Seems like a silly take imo.
    There are infinity cannons in aram…
The optimal way to use them has become spamming them down the middle of lane where minions come. If your team is pushing, the enemies die if they chase past their own minions at all. If youre being pushed in, it just becomes a game of can the mushrooms stall long enough to get you back in. Either way theyre unfun for all players but the teemo, and even then its not fun putting 90% of them in one place, and thats on an ultimate ability, which are supposed to be the most exciting abilities to use.
Local man can’t resist the allure of bushes or walking ahead of minions.
I would not mind arguing in good faith, but wtf is that :
"They deal like 0 dmg to minions, are easy to clear every other wave... like idk"

Either it's sarcasm, in which case he's missing the /s, either it's not worth talking about/with.

If I told you "Teemo is bad in ARAM because people don't use their ult", you'd be a fool to argue with me. It's pointless and fruitless.

Also, the league of legends subreddit is the last place on the internet I'd think of arguing on, regardless of what you actually say and how well you argue/document your point. People who disagree philosophically will not bother to read/educate themselves and will downvote into oblivion regardless.
Sure, but there’s plenty of other champs that shit on melee mid laners too. The fact that you get counterpicked sometimes does not make a champion OP.
    I did not say with one word that i think she is OP. I only said that she is absolutly atrocious to play against in mid and she should kindly piss off to botlane. I stand by that still 🤐
And you are able to read, congrats!

Karma was literally designed to be a midlaner but was pushed out of it like most other mages (zilean, velkoz, brand, zyra). And people always cry that people play mages as supports then people cry when people play mages in their original role. What if people would stop crying if a mage is able to play the game and also carry and not just be a wave clearing slave?
    You are making the biggest strawman Argument ive Seen in a while here. I have Not Said a single word about any mage support other than karma and not a single thing about another midlaner than karma. 

Since you cant stop putting words in my mouth i will just stop responding now. Maybe Go argue with the persons that allegedly hold the opinions you are arguing against, not with someone that has not said a single word of the above.
That's tough because I think Ability Haste is already in low supply. Could be wrong, but I see that potentially warping builds around it. It either warps builds or it gets forgotten about.
    It's not in low supply, it's just not on any of the big utility or burst items that make the big numbers happen or stop an enemy's big numbers from happening (BV, Zhonya's, Shadowflame, Stormsurge, Void, and Deathcap).

AA/Seraph's, Malignance, Cosmic Drive, and Luden's all give 25 normal haste. 4 items for 50% CDR is very good if spell slinging is your character's thing. That's a LOT of mana, too. Cryptbloom and Horizon Focus are also really good haste items.
        And out of 3 of those items, you're only building 1 because there's no need for multiple mana items unless you're Ryze
            You're trading raw damage for cooldowns. No one ever asked if building raw CDR was going to be the optimal choice or whether some stats are wasted. That's irrelevant here. The point is there is a ton of haste available if you want to go that route, and Seraph's makes sure the mana doesn't go completely to waste with a bigger shield and more AP.

We're not talking about need. But it's not like a set like this is bad in and of itself.

Luden/Malignance/seraph (whichever you need/want), Cosmic Drive, Horizon, Cryptbloom, DCap, Sorcs.

That's a total of 85 haste, which is 46% CDR. I honestly don't see the problem here. That's more than was ever achievable before ability haste existed. You can bump that to 50% if you're okay with letting sorcs slide...but probably shouldn't do that.
    Tbf, we really don’t need AH in the game atm. Cooldowns are already so low for most champs that the traditional counterplay of abusing openings is much more restricted. It’s IMO one of the poorer design philosophies Riot has picked up in the recent seasons. 

Everyone talks about the damage being the problem, but I’d prefer high damage rewarding landing skills, but being harshly punished for missing them. Doesn’t feel that way at the moment as rotations come back up pretty quickly.
That gives it a quadratic scaling which is probably not what you want.

It would have to be balanced around builds with lots of haste, which would make it bad in all other cases.
    idk I was just throwing shit out ngl. Maybe you could give it a RoA type of deal where ult CD goes up per a certain time period to a cap? or give it something like Axiom Arc's passive but touch the numbers a bit and just remove the ult cd altogether? idk I'm literally just spitting out whayever comes to mind lmao

Doesn't really work on PC, supports just don't really have the gold to get both titanic and sundered in a reasonable time frame.

This is especially the case for bruiser items as they tend to be pricier than support items by a significant margin (3300/3100 for titanic/sundered)

Not really. Most of the champs who bought it were those who wanted to slug around in middle of the fight, those with both innate sustain or other means of surviving in the fight. It didn't change the fundamental gameplay of any champion outside of the situations where it was so strong that it could have the gameplay defining effect you describe, but those situations were short and were taken care of by Riot quickly.

> Even malzahar, even though you named him in champs that don’t want to buy it (no idea why, it’s his most purchased item)

He buys it, but he doesn't want to. Right now the optimal build, in terms of damage and utility, is manaless build of Liandry into Rylai into whatever, but because Malz cannot go manaless like Swain, Brand, etc. can, he HAS to buy Malignance. This is why Malz is much weaker this season compared to previous one, why his winrate fell by 2 percent, and why a Rioter came to Malz mains discord and asked his mains their opinions about changes they would make.

> Liandries is supposed to be an anti tank item that also compliments champs that have dps in their kit. 

Okay? That's not my point. My point is that I don't believe Gore would be that egregious if it's passive was nerfed considerably in the same way Stride and Liandry were nerfed to get in line as a legendary item.
Nah there were plenty of Liandry users (Viktor this season for instance is feeling shitty due to the loss of liandry mythic) or crown users. Lots of ROA users too (anivia, ryze, swain depending on game etc). As lux there were plenty of games where it was good to go either ludens or liandry
    Liandry users picked their Liandry and never looked at other items. Same with RoA users. If you weren't one of those, it was Ludens and you weren't excited about it. So Ludens by default.
        > Liandry users picked their Liandry and never looked at other items.

Swain could and would go Luden's into certain teams regularly. Similarly Cass could easily go Liandry into certain teams.
            Swain could and would go liandries, ludens, and ROA lol.
        "ludens by default except for all the mages who didn't use Ludens which was probably more than half"
            Well yes, that's the concept of default. If you had anything especially synergistic with your kit you'd pick that and you'd end up with Ludens if you didn't, which felt back. The new situation is exactly the same thing but with Malignance as one of the synergy options. They didn't solve anything for the champs that unhappily ended up buying Ludens but they also didn't make anything worse either. The situation being your kit picking the mana item for you or having to pick an unexciting one was already there.
        ? I don't know what elo you're in but there were a huge number of mages who could swap between Luden's and Liandry's last season, and you didn't need to have a special synergy to want Liandry's either. It was a common choice even on champions like Syndra, who made a decision between that and Luden's based on how squishy the enemy comp was and how much they needed the haste in a particular game.

The number of mages who were hard-locked into Luden's by lack of other options was extremely small. Almost every mage could opt into Liandry's if they felt like it.
        Syndra could go both
My experience was that, which maybe skewed because I play these tanky battlemages like Swain, Vlad, Cass etc was that a lot of popular mages like Ori, Syndra, Viktor, Xerath etc. could opt for Liandry if there were enough health stackers because they got really good mileage out of the damage amp from bonus health, which at times could give up to 10 percent bonus damage on all damage. I would also regularly see some of them take Crown if the situation permitted it.
Nah the longer the game goes on the more cannons spawn and if you get the inhib teemo becomes considerably weaker than before.
That's a pretty gross exaggeration of shacos capabilities. Boxes die in 1 auto/ability and aren't able to 1 shot a wave. They also don't stay on map for very long and most a wave will hit 2 or 3. Boxes won't be able to stop a push. As for teems shrooms, what else does teemo do in aram? He blinds and throws shrooms. He doesn't have the same aeo dmg as other mages. He has far less range than other mages and marksmen. He is very squishy, has no cc other than blind. I think it's OK if he kills a wave after he dies.
    Shaco also has a box limit of 6 in aram iirc. Still obnoxious playing against him as a melee/tank since its impossible to engage him without cannon wave but not OP imo
    Sure, Shaco's not as bad and teemo is relatively easy to kill. You asked why people thought teemo wasn't fun to play against in aram, that's why. It's not about winrate, it's that the specific mechanics he relies on aren't fun to play against, at least for me.
        I think teemos shrooms are actually fun to play against. It's something different that you have to pay attention to. Like a mini game. Plus, should teemo be removed from a specific game mode just because they think it's unfun? Seems like a silly take imo.
There are infinity cannons in aram…
I did not say with one word that i think she is OP. I only said that she is absolutly atrocious to play against in mid and she should kindly piss off to botlane. I stand by that still 🤐
You are making the biggest strawman Argument ive Seen in a while here. I have Not Said a single word about any mage support other than karma and not a single thing about another midlaner than karma. 

Since you cant stop putting words in my mouth i will just stop responding now. Maybe Go argue with the persons that allegedly hold the opinions you are arguing against, not with someone that has not said a single word of the above.
It's not in low supply, it's just not on any of the big utility or burst items that make the big numbers happen or stop an enemy's big numbers from happening (BV, Zhonya's, Shadowflame, Stormsurge, Void, and Deathcap).

AA/Seraph's, Malignance, Cosmic Drive, and Luden's all give 25 normal haste. 4 items for 50% CDR is very good if spell slinging is your character's thing. That's a LOT of mana, too. Cryptbloom and Horizon Focus are also really good haste items.
    And out of 3 of those items, you're only building 1 because there's no need for multiple mana items unless you're Ryze
        You're trading raw damage for cooldowns. No one ever asked if building raw CDR was going to be the optimal choice or whether some stats are wasted. That's irrelevant here. The point is there is a ton of haste available if you want to go that route, and Seraph's makes sure the mana doesn't go completely to waste with a bigger shield and more AP.

We're not talking about need. But it's not like a set like this is bad in and of itself.

Luden/Malignance/seraph (whichever you need/want), Cosmic Drive, Horizon, Cryptbloom, DCap, Sorcs.

That's a total of 85 haste, which is 46% CDR. I honestly don't see the problem here. That's more than was ever achievable before ability haste existed. You can bump that to 50% if you're okay with letting sorcs slide...but probably shouldn't do that.
Tbf, we really don’t need AH in the game atm. Cooldowns are already so low for most champs that the traditional counterplay of abusing openings is much more restricted. It’s IMO one of the poorer design philosophies Riot has picked up in the recent seasons. 

Everyone talks about the damage being the problem, but I’d prefer high damage rewarding landing skills, but being harshly punished for missing them. Doesn’t feel that way at the moment as rotations come back up pretty quickly.
idk I was just throwing shit out ngl. Maybe you could give it a RoA type of deal where ult CD goes up per a certain time period to a cap? or give it something like Axiom Arc's passive but touch the numbers a bit and just remove the ult cd altogether? idk I'm literally just spitting out whayever comes to mind lmao
OH! My mind immediately went to LeBlanc (probably because I used to OTP her a few years back). 

Also to clarify, I was saying Malignance INTO Lich Bane not necessarily Malignance is better than Lich Bane. Even though I think both Mal into LB and Mal > LB are both best/true atm.
    That’s definitely fair lol, I know it’s the same acronym for both, I coulda just said Lich like I did in the second response I guess :p

It’s really good on Ahri, even the damage is decent, I just tend to assume a 120AP item could outperform it in some situations, and if you’re going to take Luden’s you don’t need the extra mana > AP.
Yes and high elo is what is balanced around 99% of the time. So whats the point in even bringing low elo up in a balance discussion? Almost never is a change aimed for them because things like meta don't even matter down there.
People in low elo are humans who are capable of learning. It might take them a little longer, but they do it all the time. So if the reason something is strong or weak in low elo is lack of knowledge on the player's part, it is reasonable to ask that player to just learn.
well neither do I usually but if the stats are 51-55% wr in pretty much all ranks, its a safe argument to make in my book.

 I should think that the ahris and zeds in master rank at least know how their champs work, yet its still almost 55% wr to ahri
    That’s fair! I think you’re right!
Well.. top laners sit on two completed items for a while unless they snowball, too. Should they stop building bruisers' items, too? Jugglers sit on completed jungle item +1 completed item for a while as well. Should they stop building bruisers' items, too? Yes, it'll take longer to complete them. But if you're paying attention to the game state and your gold gain consistency across matches, you can easily adjust your playstyle and build order to better accommodate varying factors in the gold "deficit" that supports apparently have
    Top laners still consistently are getting gold to build more items. If supports and top laners build the same items, top laners will be building them significantly faster. (also many bruiser items scale well with base stats/champ level, which top laners will have more of).

Bruiser items frankly aren't that amazing when you are behind in items, but are really strong when you are ahead compared to any other class.

Theres also a big difference between titanic + sundered compared to like solstice sleigh + sundered.

There's a reason there are 0 supports right now that build bruiser items outside of camille (who isn't doing so hot since nerfs to bloodsong). And camille is mostly there because she abuses bloodsong harder than any other champ (best sheen user in the game)
I disagree that liandries is decent into bruisers or tanks for that matter. I think wed see alot more mages top and mages splitpushing into enemy toplaners if it was. But we dont cause mages dont have the initial burst to kill through bruiser items and dont have the mobility to survive extended fights where liandries would see value.
To an extent yes, however during mythic items, there wasn't much MR for tanks to build. Most of the MR items gave like 40 MR, and none of them were first items (only jak'sho had MR for first tank item). It's why rumble, despite getting much better liandry's and more anti-tank damage in his kit is largely performing much worse into tanks this season relatively.

As a tank player at least, it is far less painful to play into magic damage now, and you are drastically tankier (unless it's like brand/lillia/asol or some other %hp magic damage champ that also build liandrys)
Yea this
Liandry users picked their Liandry and never looked at other items. Same with RoA users. If you weren't one of those, it was Ludens and you weren't excited about it. So Ludens by default.
