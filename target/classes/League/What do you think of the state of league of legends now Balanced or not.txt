[[What do you think of the state of league of legends now Balanced or not]]


What do you think of the state of league of legends at the moment? Do you think it's fully balanced as if can be or other things outweight others in terms of balance?

How's the current balance team doing? Do you feel like their changes are the right changes for the game?

What do you think league needs?


Balanced on paper (over the course of 10s of thousands of games), but the combination of matchmaking, individual performance variance between matches, and game design means individual matches will very rarely feel balanced.
There have always been broken champs. I don’t think what’s going on currently is anything unique, really.

There will always be flavor of the week champs. There will always be champs who are bad. This is just the nature of having like.. 160+ champs. Naturally some are going to be worse when multiple champs fill the same niche/playstyle.


Everyone wants league to be like how it was when they first started playing.

I’m pretty much playing a different champ every game and I’m having tons of fun. Im going to run across a broken build or champ eventually, and that’s okay. I can just play something just as broken.

Riot is going to make balancing mistakes, they’re human. You can only hire so many people to test and develop a game. Bugs, broken mechanics…learn to have fun with them and the game becomes a lot more fun.
    Do you think they need to release less or more champions or as it is right now is fine?
        I’m not really an authority on that, but I can give my opinion:

New champs are fun to mess around with, new content is fun. Unfortunately it can make it harder to balance other champs, items and runes. Riot of course is a company and they exist to make money, so they’re gonna release new champs. If they release a champ, I’ll try it out. If I like it, I’ll play it for a while.


With that, I don’t know if they should release more or less. As long as they’re quality and at least bring something new/interesting to the table, I really can’t complain.
League is way more balanced than people like to admit, and is balanced better than most games more than people like to admit.
Target access has increased over time making it so bot has to be capable of doing redicusless damage early in the game which makes the whole game feel really bursty. In my opinion bringing down target access would allow them to reduce the overall damage and would make the game more fun.

But its in an alright state, im still playing after like 9 years or so.
    Lee used to be the king of non-ult engage and stick potential
His q range was rediculous for a gap closer. He also had his W for ANOTHER.
But lee gave up a ward, double cooldown, and his shield for the free dash AND had to hit his Q. 
Camille and yone merely want to be on you and your are too close. 
Camille can R you from 2 towers away(legit E, ward flash e2 R(+ any dash item now LOL) and you can't even escape. 
Yone E walk q3 R and bam longer engage range than xerath R. 
Lee used to miss Q and lose 60% of his burst. 
Yone fires his q3 and R without even attempting to hit them just for a gap closer to kill you anyway. Plus dash item. Flash. Ghost. Etc.
Too many champs need to be permabanned to even have a chance not to have a degenerate game
    Who would they be if you had more than 1 ban?
        Top: Illaoi/Malphite/Rumble, Jungle: Kindred, Eve, Khazix, Kayn, Reksai yadayadayada, Mid: Ahri, Neeko, Zed, Naafiri, Kata, AD: Ashe/Kai'Sa, Support: Xerath, Zyra, Rakan
Item Damage too high, Strategy too scarce.
    I don't think it's the items anymore, items have mostly eaten nerfs since the item rework. It's Champion base damage and Ratio's that have been endlessly buffed and it's less noticable because it goes gradually.
        Hashinshin Viewers be like.

It's both IMO, it's whatever Game sucks.
The game is balanced around everything having counterplay, but the counterplay required isnt always present which makes it feel unbalanced at times. A broad but good example of this is enemy team locking in yi or kata after you already picked ezreal, and your whole team locks in champs with no cc; well the yi or kata is gonna feel incredibly unbalanced when in reality they are balanced in the proper scenario. some champs leave fewer tools to counter them, or the answer isnt as obvious as gw vs soraka. Smurfs/poor mm along with the game being snowbally also warps the perception of what is balanced. Then you tie in psychology and the fact that players remember bad experiences more vividly then good experiences. But aside from a few outliers I think the game is in a pretty healthy state atm, nothing feels unbeatable, frustrating at times sure, but definitely manageable.
is it balanced ; not   


what it need ; balancing
I dont think there are any *useless* champs, everything has a niche somewhere that can be filled.


But there are most definitely flat out broken champs. Zed being simultaneously tanky, capable of one shotting when barely fed, very high mobility and extremely safe to do risky shit makes him feel like theres no downside to picking him. 


Other shit like karthus/sion who are literally encouraged to die to provide more value feel like a lose/lose situation where if you kill dont them they get value but if you do kill them they get value anyways... either way they can int and still provide immense value from existing.


Also toplane needs fixing, but other than this stuff i hardly have issues with league's balance
I just hate how damage focused we currently are. I hate AH because stacking it ends up being more damage than actual damage items. I hate that some champions cannot exist unless they buy one item and that's their identity.

It's almost balanced but there are things that need to be fixed. I wish this game wasn't 2 item powerspike. It's causing games to feel like you can't win until the enemy makes bad plays and that's not going to happen 90% of the time.
Bruiser In general are too strong ( champions kits but mostly botrk dd maw) 
But mostly my problem is with jungle. 
It was always the role with most impact on the game by default, which is fine.
Problem is in the later season they got too many tools and resources.
They basically get same gold and Xp as sololanes but they are not punished for mistakes nearly as much, let me explain.

Back in the day, if I'm syndra lv 6 enemy Jung ( let's say khaziz for example ) would be lower level but let's assume he was still same level as me.
He would gank, hit auto q w , chunk my hp to 50% and I had to burn flash, in return I hit him with full e q w ult combo and chunk 80% of his hp. 
From this point, my lane was fked (half HP and no flash) but me using all coldowns on him fked his Jung clear too because he couldn't go jungle to clear while being so low.
Nowadays he can clear raptors and gank me again at 80% HP 20 second later because for some reason now they heal in jungle. 
That's on top of:
Jungler get infinite mana hack nowdays
Champions as I said getting more xp and gold from jungle
Objectives being more worth than back in the day
And for some reason they also have XP catch up mechanics. 

If I'm a laner 3 lvl down my enemy would be almost impossible to catch up in XP unless enemy later fuck up HARD 
AS jungler no problem just go clear a couple of camps (I know it's getting rounded evenly next patch instead of always up)
I feel its pretty decent. Not great but for sure its far from the worst meta we got. I'd say is balanced in my opinion
So i started the Game in 2020 my thoughts are about a limeized time. I think the deletion of the smurfque was a mistake. I can understand, Riots view on it that many Players wich where coming back after a longertime (like a year), where fallsly put into it. The deletion resultet in toxic players and smurfs beeing seperatetd from other players , to be freed to all other players. An other thing we never find out the true about it, is the disperancy beetween visible rank and MMr. Would be interesting to new How the addition of Emerald and the bigger LP loss/gains affected the systems.
League will never be perfectly balanced. I think the game isn't nearly as unstable as we like to believe when we are having games where we get outperformed. The slow down on champion release is good. I do think items could use a bit of a tweak mainly in that I hate how much cross class dipping is happening with assassin items but at the same time there's actual trade offs in those games and I've watched lethality Aatrox get whooped enough times that it's clear to me that it's not as OP as people tend to act like it is. I also think the game rewards trying to bounce back more than it ever has while providing the tools to still stomp early if you make good decisions. There's a lot of user error in League and people hate admitting that.
    I think the issue stems from ranked/mmr not being accurate to true skill/impact. 
I have seen too many wins where I could have afked and won and other games where faker wouldn't be able to carry. 
Won games with a 0/15 top who also afked twice and actively tries to surrender no hope. 
The mid is 0/9+
Then jg is 1/7 and I am alistar.
Doesn't make sense.
They bent the game's balance completely out of shape for the sake of selling Naafiri, making her super exciting and high winrate while they were trying to sell her skin. It really felt like things were going in a good direction for a while before this, and then right at the start of the new split everything went to shit
Needs more nerfs than buffs
League (and other games for that matter) will never be balanced. It is also not the goal. 

League had a rolling meta of buffs and nerfs to various camps and items making some good and some bad.

It's not in a bad state though, for the average player most champs are at least playable.
My Problem as an Support at the Moment is when i got a fed Adc and the enemy Kha zix ( 2 Level behind) jumps on my adc and kinda oneshots him even i gave him a shield?

I see many Adc leaving the Role cause it feels in many Situation very unplayable. 

also many Tanks are able to 3-shot an Adc its just too much Health and too much Damage in the game. actually adc is the only class which dont got Health items in their builds! tbh atm caster are more tanky than adc which feels rly unpleasant if you get 2-shoted by spells of them.

i feel really helpless innmany situations as an support cause i cant prevent my adc from dying when the enemy got like 2-3 champs which are able to jump/oneshot him
Unbalanced, too much damage, too much gold 

game is barely a moba anymore, it's turned into an arena that i most cases is settled the first 5 minutes even sooner.
Balance... kept our powers wasted.
The issue with league is the mmr tries really hard to yield "balanced quick" games. 
Like apex legends. 2 preds 1 low rank vs diamond/plats. "Balanced".
The way you rank up, being based entirely on win/loss and mmr is bad for a game where only certain champions can end the game effectively.
Turrets. Minion lines. Enemy champions. Nexus. Inhib. Dragons. Barons. 
These all die via damage, and cc only matters vs the champions(no 10 sec minion stuns in league for tanks to cc lock push waves).
Tanks need to go damage/push to push towers. To end. To be threatening. To matter. 
Enchanters need ap/damage. To push waves. To take towers. To be relevant vs drag/baron.
If riot makes your low damage tank and low damage enchanter your 2 preds and everyone else your irons in a gold game, you lose. The yone simply splits with anti-magic build and hullbreaker after going 4/12. He just wins at some point and you don't.
Do you think they need to release less or more champions or as it is right now is fine?
