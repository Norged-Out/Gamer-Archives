[[Playing Twilight Princess for the first time. Loving it, wish Midna was less of a spoilsport though]]


So I just got the master sword, and with it the ability to transform whenever I want. The first thing I wanted to do, obviously, was to transform in front of the mayor and see him freak out.

Midna said no to that. Apparently I would "scare somebody" as if that wasn't precisely what I was aiming to do.

Also, just got done doing physically-improbable wolf backflips through castle town while people screamed. Nothing more terrifying than a wolf doing backflips. Midna wouldn't let me transform back even when nobody could see me until after I left the town.

I am having a great time doing things animals are not supposed to do, but Midna's here raining on my parade. It's not HER cursed crystal thing, why does SHE get to decide how I use it?

Total aside, one of the cats in castle town is a moron. Said he's looking for Telma's bar, I transform into a human and carry him there, he still doesn't know where the bar is.

Anyway, having a great time, wish I played this 17 years ago but better late than never.


Lol Midna's trying to keep you from breaking immersion. Love to hear about your shenanigans.
Midna is the GOAT of Zelda companions
    Y e s
    i agree
    She’s a great companion. That’s one of many things TP does best
    It's a pretty low bar
        True, but Midna is still great.
            I agree. It's also my favorite Amiibo
I mean, lore wise she's stopping you from being attacked yourself. If you're the mayor and you see Link, the helpful ranch hand who turned up a year or so back, suddenly turn into a beast before your eyes, wouldn't you never be able to trust him again? You'd probably get called a demon and killed or at least banished from the village.

Of course it would be funny gameplay wise as you’ve illustrated with your other shenanigans but I'm sure that's why the developers didn't let you do that. Not to be a spoil sport as well haha, just making a point.
    I mean, when I see a big dog show up in my yard that I don't know, as long as they're not being aggressive I don't mind. If I saw that dog suddenly stop being a human, I probably would be a little freaked out, but it wouldn't be cause to never trust that person again in my eyes?

Although based on how everyone is terrified of wolf link doing backflips through castle town, perhaps being a wolf is unpardonable in Hyrule.
        That's just it: it's a wolf. A predator. Not just a big dog. When you see wolves, it means they're likely hunting you or livestock or children and they're not usually alone. In a world of legend and magic, seeing a human transform into one is just as scary and you can't possibly trust someone who might have an instinct to kill you. There's general paranoia of beasts and monsters surrounding villages and attacking travellers.
        A group of monsters attacked the village and stole all of the children. The night you first transform and make it back to the village, they treat you like a monster. I feel like you’re leaving out some of the context when you consider how they’d feel about Link, a well known and loved villager, transforming into a beast.
Go to Castle Town, transform out of sight, run around, people get scared and run away especially if you attack. Have fun.
Midna becomes like the most interesting and beloved character in the series so you’ll come around lol
    I like her in general. I don't like her being my mom and telling me not to put my hand on the stove because it's hot, I want to burn my hand dang it
        Well that’s any Nintendo game lol
About that cat, i'm pretty sure he's just an npc with no sidequest
    Thanks, I figured it must be just flavor text but there was a cat earlier that wouldn't register as "home" until they ate a fish even if they were at home so I couldn't be sure
You’ll love Midna by the end. She’s like the one friend who’s love language is roasting people but like in a loving way.
    Oh yeah definitely a great character, a highlight of the game. She's just also the one that won't let me abuse magic that could scare others for my own amusement
Midna is by far the greatest Zelda character in the whole franchise
Midna not letting you transform is kind of a nod to Majoras mask where you could transform anywhere and no one would react to it.
I normally \*hate* mascot characters, midna though, just kinda hit me the right way, she's so far one of three mascots I don't dislike

She'll grow on you as you learn more about her
    I think I misrepresented how I feel about Midna.

I like the character. Like her personality, she's a little goober that is very much like some of my friends.

I do not like specifically the fact that she, as a video game character, is stopping me from making bad choices in a medium where the consequences cannot reach me. It's like if in GTA you had a fairy following you around that physically would not allow you to commit a crime.

From a worldbuilding and narrative standpoint, the goober that wouldn't think twice about harmless pranks putting her foot down at intentionally scaring people makes sense. She's not mean, and I can appreciate her being firm on that point.

But this is a video game, and as such I don't have to behave the same way I would in real life, so someone stopping me from making decisions I could only make in a game is not appreciated.
        Ah yea, I can get behind that, I think lorewise she doesn't want any unnecessary complications like people thinking you're just a monster and not being allowed to do anything in town, which is probably what would happen, counter to that, gameplay wise, developers couldn't code reactions to that with their budget 

But if they ever give it a full remake (unlikely) I bet there would be some goofy shenanigans with that happening
I know why they didn’t, but I wish the transformation into wolf form was treated like it was in Majora’s mask. Additionally, I also wish townsfolk just treated wolf Link like the good boy he is, instead of running away screaming. “That mark on his head is not natural in wolves, he’s probably domesticated.” Is what they’d think.
    Well Minda riding on wolf Link probably doesn’t help in them thinking it’s safe to be around Link, since they probably think a monster domesticated him like the Moblins and the hogs they ride
I wish Midna was bouncing on my shit fr man
    What the fu...
    Based
Yeah midna sucks
How very dare you!
This is entirely off topic, but I've randomly been recommended this post by Reddit. I played this game when I was a kid, but quit when I couldn't beat the mission where you need to defend the wagon from flaming arrows. Am I crazy or was that a hard mission?
    I didn't find it hard, but I first attempted it at age 22 so that probably helped.

The horse controls are really difficult and it took a while, but the wagon has so much HP that even after it got set on fire like 5 times I still finished the mission with it at like two thirds of its HP.

You say you played it as a kid - did you know how to read yet? Putting out the fires with a boomerang was the last thing on my mind until text showed up on screen to tell me.
        Lol that's probably it! I might have been able to read, but I likely missed the message entirely, I remember watching my wagon slowly burn down till I lost!
I wonder if there is an AR cheat code that would remove the flag that prevents you from transforming anywhere. I'd love to see that.
This was a great read lol
I had no opinion on Midna until the part where you have to race her to Zelda, after that she became and will always be the GOAT
My single complaint about Twilight Princess is that a lot of the early Wolf segments of the game have really strange lighting and if I play them in long bursts I get headaches. But even still this game is great and I recently got to play through it with my 10 year old son who loved the crap out of it. His first Zelda game was Breath of the Wild so the older more linear style was new to him.
If you ever are getting annoyed that she wont let you transform in castle town, theres some spots where you can transform in the cat yard (jovanis yard) or if you go through the doors towards the castle... maybe down by telmas bar... little nooks and crannies where the townspeople cant see you 

I feel like I remember running around castle town in wolf-mode aimlessly, enjoying all the shrieks and screams of the city folk, to the point where guards were showing up and jabbing at link with spears... and when I tried transforming back into a human midna was like "uuhh... you've really stirred these guys up, I think we need to lie low for awhile before you come back" and I always thought that was hilarious
To be fair, it makes more sense than putting a mask on in front of a guard and him being like "ah I didn't see you standing there before".
How dare you?!?
