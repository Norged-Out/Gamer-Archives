[[God bless the valve and respawn janitors]]





Not to mention that Overwatch just committed suicide.
    how come?
        Go look at what all the Overwatch content creators are saying. They know more about this than I do.
        They recently released the co-op mode that was supposed to be what made overwatch 2 overwatch 2 and not just an expansion of overwatch 1. Except they’re releasing it in chunks as paid DLC, they’re super easy to beat very quickly, and have virtually no replay value.
Actually both communities are filled with tumors : edgelords in tf2 and toxic fucks in tf|2.
    Winning against you and or teabagging is not toxic. It’s a game. Lighten up.
        Did you forget tf|2 has a chat?I never mentioned teabagging or wins
            Did you forget you can turn it off, or flat out ignore it? There’s never really gonna be good info coming from your team, and you’ll very, *very* rarely need to coordinate something to win a game. If someone specific is being irritating, mute them. I get that it’s still upsetting, but it comes right back around to the fact that it’s just a game. If they’re trashing on you for having a bad game, don’t worry about it. You’ll get em next time.
