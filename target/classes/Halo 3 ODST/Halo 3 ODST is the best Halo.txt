[[Halo 3 ODST is the best Halo]]


Playing through the MCC has been an interesting experience for me. The only games I'd played in the whole series were Reach and 4, so I didn't have the nostalgia for the series that most people have. Nevertheless I think all the Halo games are at least good (in the case of Combat Evolved, just OK) and are at best excellent. Halo 3 was my own favorite so far, but I wasn't ready for the experience that was ODST.

ODST is much smaller in scope and different in tone than any of the Halo games. Reach is what it's closest to in every respect, but even Noble Team is still a group of Spartans who can do anything. The rest of the Halo games are Master Chief going around winning the entire war against the Covenant in a day. ODST is about a group of people who've been fighting a losing battle for the whole war, and can only really be concerned with getting out of a city with their lives, and completing their mission if they're lucky.

The voice talent really shows its worth. ODST is better written and voiced than any other Halo game by far in my opinion. Its characters feel like real human beings rather than the Doomguy-with-a-voice Master Chief or whatever Arbiter is. I feel like the fact that half the cast is from Firefly makes them work together a bit better, too. 
The gunplay itself isn't too different from the mainline games, aside from the fact that your character is a little weaker and has night vision. The real change is the mission structure. Half the game is structured missions like regular old Halo, and all of them are excellent. The other portion is a semi-open world which has a few collectibles to find and is the place where all the main missions intersect at one point or another. It's not the best open world because there's not really anything to do aside from going from one mission to the next, but it's made better by the excellent moody music and the somber, quiet tone. 

Overall, ODST takes what's great about Halo and focuses it into a tight, well-written narrative about great characters doing their best to survive in a situation that Chief and Cortana would blaze through in about 2 levels. Literally. That's what they did in Halo 2.
9/10 would reccommend


Been playing the games as they come out. I agree with ODST being the best in the campaign though. Found a new hatred for Buck though. Whats the point of saying, "You drive, I'll shoot." if you never fucking shoot.
    It’s not that he doesn’t shoot, it’s that he’s not shooting at that ghost right in front of us cmon buck he’s shooting at me right now no wait why are you shooting that grunt on the other side of the bridge buck pls
        Oh, for me he just sat there and stared at stuff. My strategy was to drive him into the middle and then get into the turret myself.
    Yea but I mean, it’s Nathan Fillion though. His voice is too cool for me to hate
        He's charming as fuck in real life and in games

Love you, Cayde
    Hey it's better then letting them drive. I let one of them drive in Reach and all they did was go around in circles
ODST was always my favourite halo campaign. 3 was terrific too but ODST really just checked every box for me. Strangely though I hated reach back in the day but when I got MCC on pc launch I had a new found respect for the campaign at least.
Was thinking the same thing while playing ODST yesterday. Working your way through narrow streets, the darkened alleys, picking your battles with the covenant, and all with the small splashing of your footsteps in the cold wet night were all artfully executed. The jazzy somber music really adds into the atmosphere as well, but I do think majority of the tracks are a bit forgetful. There are two that really stand out.

I think the main campaign missions are a hit or miss, but they're definitely good overall. I think they're necessary to help with the pacing in the narrative. But, I do think the small hub streets is what steals the show.

The narrative with Rookie has him play out as a detective, but I wish it actually had some detective mechanics.

This is also has to be one of the easier games to play on Legendary. Mouse/Keyboard on PC definitely makes the Halo Legendary Difficulty a lot easier to do solo, but ODST has been the easiest of the games thus far.
    Yeah I think Rookie’s part of the game felt underdeveloped. Like I said the open world is cool but there’s not much to do in it.
100% agree.
Very chill, I think this one is on gamepass!

(Wow, requires 119 gigs of disc space!)
>about great characters

Man there's nothing great about any of these characters.

Rookie is more bland than Master Chief. Buck's only characterization is that he and Dare used to be a thing. Dutch is a really big, brash 12 year old. He sounds like a highly motivated member of McNamara's 100,000. And the other two are so forgettable I don't even have anything to write about them. There's no depth to any of these characters.

The characters in Noble Team are criticized for being a bit dull but they are still significantly better than ODST. The protagonist is again a pretty blank slate but at least we get a bit of info about how he was a lone wolf and is very competent. Carter is a strong leader, interacts professionally with his teammates and does everything he can to get the job done. Jorge is absolute beast but he's also the level-headed one, shows compassion towards civilians and gives his life for the team without hesistation. Jun and Kate are a bit dull I admit. Kat's kinda snappy but seemingly clever. And then Emil is aggressive with a 'I'm gonna take as many of you with me as I can personality.'  I would call these characters good but far from great, but still pretty much all of them besides Jun I find more interesting than anyone from ODST.

There's a lot of subjective stuff to reviewing a game. For example I find Mombasa Streets to be horribly bland but I can understand why some people might like the change of pace. But I really struggle to see how anyone would think of these characters as great or even interesting.
    I won't pretend ODST has stellar character development but it's got way more than Reach ever had.
        They have zero character development, absolutely none. Not one character evolves ot changes besides Dare who softens up a bit after being a hardass. But she is only around in the first 3 min and last couple missions of the game.

ODST at least we get a squad that dwindles down one by one from an unstoppable force to a unit trading lives to complete the mission. We get to watch the Spartans become mortal. ODST the mission happens, they get a bit tired, one of them is wounded but that's it. They do not develop at all.
This game was so much fun in co-op Legendary
I've come to realise my problem with Halo 3: ODST is that one shouldn't try to meet their heroes. I've always liked the characters one place lower on the coolness totem pole, such as the Imperial Guard to the Space Marines, the Warriors of Chaos to the Daemons of Chaos, and in the case of Halo, the ODSTs to the Spartans.

ODST's  good in everything it does, from the intervals scouring a city with detective skills, and the typical Halo stuff. I just felt that there wasn't enough of either though, and a whole game dedicated to one aspect or the other wouldn't have worked or would've ended up being my preferred Halo Reach.

But I'm not sure what I wanted from this. I still don't. On the one hand I think the ODSTs are well portrayed, and on the other I think they just feel too much like Spartans. I'm not sure what the developers could've done to satisfy someone like me, assuming of course, there's others who fanboi out over them as much as I did (do?). Honestly, I'm not quite sure who ODST was for, other than a test to see if something like Reach could've been done.

This is one of the few games I'd give anything to like. Perhaps if I went back to it without such a hardon for its protagonists, I might well enjoy it.
    That’s the issue with video game protagonists. In the other Halos the ODST’s are just reskins of regular marines and die just as easily. In the ODST game they are a bit better but still aren’t quite gung-ho walking tanks like Chief is.
OP definitely younger than 20 y.o. &/or never played Halo: Combat Evolved when it came out in 2001 ... if we're comparing games for their respective times, I can't agree with this.

its a solid game & probably a top 5 but not my #1
    I’m older than 20, I just never got an original Xbox. I think CE has some great gunplay and enemies, but a lot of things like level design and vehicle combat just get so much better in later games. Level design in particular. The back half of the game feels (and in many ways is) like a repeat of the first half with the flood and makes me wanna bang my head against a wall. Never had that same feeling with any other Halo game.
Reach multiplayer will always be my favorite flavor of Halo, but that ODST campaign will always be my favorite campaign of the series. Still love the soundtrack to this day too!
Looking forward to it. I only played halo 1 multiplayer and halo 3 campaign. Now starting the whole shebang, started Reach the other day :)
Gracia, now I. Gonna go back with a new perspective and actually finish it. This is why I'm on this sub. Your review was not in vain.
> Halo 3: ODST is the best Halo

you spelled Halo Reach wrong.
Sure if you have a very low baseline. I regret buying the mcc, so far i got 4 shit games when I could have bought the discounted shadow warrior 2 earlier.

I just finished downloading odst and stopped playing 30 after. Bullet sponge with regenerating shields and no hit reaction is disgusting, Bungie should stop developing games. The series is up there with new wolfenstein and battlefield as the worst action fps ive played.
    Maybe Halo isn’t for you
    Tell me more about your perfevt taste in games, cutie.
        Sure, have fun soaking your bullet sponge.
I wholeheartedly agree with you, I initially started off by assuming it was a lazily made game with minor tweaks to already existing Halo 3 assets but when I played it for the first time recently I fell in love with the story, characters, and everything about this gem. I find myself being so glad that I was wrong in my beliefs that this was a bad game, because at this point I consider it to be my favorite from the franchise and one of the best games I’ve played in a long time.
