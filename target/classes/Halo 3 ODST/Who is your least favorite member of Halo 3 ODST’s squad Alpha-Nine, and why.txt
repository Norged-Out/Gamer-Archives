[[Who is your least favorite member of Halo 3 ODST’s squad Alpha-Nine, and why]]





At one time I would have said Romeo because I find him obnoxious, but after reading New Blood, it’s >! Mickey !<
    What did he do again? Oh right, didn’t he turn on them?
        And got rookie killed. I feel 343 management likes to waste story telling and game potential on purpose.
            what stories could have been done with rookie that couldn’t be replaced by generic odst #30385?
                The problem isn't inherently him dying, it's that they did it in a fucking book
                    Tbf, how do you have a game with Rookie without you playing as him? He's a silent protagonist. 

So the only real issue from a gameplay standpoint isn't there - it's just the "why would you kill the player character avatar of a group in a fan driven media empire?"

It's a wider problem of the Halo 4-5 era: so many important things happen off screen in a book. And unlike Mass Effect (which had a similar issue) you can just do a simple exposition dump with a character explaining everything the vast majority of gamers who focus on standalone book empires if they read books at all.
                        Not just 4-5 era, Rubicon Protocol and Shadows of Reach are squarely in Infinite era. They’re still forwarding the plot in major ways offscreen.
                            Ah yes, I love having the most exciting thing to happen to the UNSC occur immediately before I start playing a game where I now have to pick up the pieces in set pieces that are no where near comparable to the destruction of the biggest vessel in the UNSC fleet.
                One where rookie goes to a coffee shop and talks about his unique life experiences?
                    > talks

can’t happen
                        He walks into the coffee shop, gives the cashier the exact amount of money for what he wants, and when he picks up his order he starts having flashbacks from someone else's POV about his own life.
                        One where he thinks?
                            i mean yeah he could think, not sure how you’d make an interesting halo story where one guy thinks sometimes
                Because the Rookie has character traits that are shown to the player rather than told. He has a history that can be referenced and used to inform his decision making. He's a blank slate in that we don't know specifics about him, but he has a character that relied exclusively on showing and not telling.
                    Not only that, but he was the camera through which we experienced ODST, even when you play as the other characters it's in a flashback after he finds something. So naturally the players are going to develop an attachment regardless of if he says anything, in fact him not saying anything is even better because it lets the atmosphere and the scenery tell the story.

His situation in the game is he woke up 9 hours after drop, the battle has already been fought and lost, he doesn't know where his squad is or if they're even alive, and the city is swarming with covies, mix that with the rain and that sweet sweet sax music and the detective noir aspect where he looks for clues, all the while finding areas where people made their last stand along the way. Beautiful story telling through the environment and atmosphere alone, and he is the lens through which the player experiences it.

Doomguy never said a damn thing either (until recently), and he was loved even before the 2016 game, just because the protagonist is silent doesn't mean they don't have character, actions speak louder than words.
Also something like 70% of communication is body language, you can mostly guess what he's feeling, what he's thinking during the cutscenes based on his movement and the way he carries himself, truly they did an outstanding job with him.
                Aside from killing off a player character. 

Who says he has to stay an odst? Why couldn't he go spartan4 and be playable in spartan ops in h4?
                Anything better than you ever written, that's for sure.
                    Idk how to cook or bake but I can easily tell when someone put dog turd between two buns and called it a sandvich, you don't need to be an expert to criticize

And they didn't say the book was bad, they said 343 wastes interesting hooks and it's true
                    bruh what i’m literally not a writer lmao, that’s not exactly a high bar
                    Going after the guy saying it won't transform bad 343 writing into good
            Brian reed approved
                That bastard was the start of the fall. You could argue that escalation was the catalyst.. being right after 4, and right when Reed took over, but wow he really goofed up a ton of projects. How he kept getting greenlit is beyond me.
            Actually wouldn't mind that story getting retconned a bit.
                “Somehow, the Rookie returned”
            I mean it’s a book, right? So couldn’t they ever con it, or at least change some of it so that buck still becomes a spartan (I haven’t played 5 that’s all I know) but
            343's storytelling is horrible, they're making the distiny mistake of rushing to show everything instead of leaving some mystery to players' imagination, as well as making strange story decisions that just seem like generic story beats incorporating any named character they can find and subsequently kind of ruining them...

that being said, there's still nothing getting close to touching the kilo 5 trilogy
            Died like a rookie too lol
            >And got rookie killed. I feel 343 management likes to waste story telling and game potential on purpose.

 Just because it made you mad doesn't mean the writing was bad or whatever. The entire cast of ODST is honestly a bunch of undisciplined shit heels so everything going badly wasn't all that surprising at all.
                [removed]
                    lol honey your acct is gonna get suspended
                        Good

Also, there's only one c in act go back to primary
            rookie's death was before mickey's defection
                Yes but it was his hesitation to shoot an Innie that allowed said Innie to shoot Rookie in the head.

Like that is actual guilt Mickey was carrying about that.
                    shit you're right, sorry lol
            Rookie wasn’t a character. 

He had less character than the odst that walks up to you at the start of delta halo

Less than any of the marines featured in any of the games
            Would've loved that as a Halo 5 spin off dlc campaign.
    Yeah, natch. 👍
    Yeah fuck >!Mickey!<
    This
    No
    All my homies hate Mickey.
    I just finished bad blood yesterday, if you haven’t read it, it’s crazy! Might give you a second opinion but that honestly is the correct choice, only by a little bit. It’s hard to hate Alpha 9.
Romeo, I don’t find him charming enough to get away with how much he runs his mouth
    Agreed. He is tolerable in the Helljumper comics because you get his internal monologue but it did not translate well to the game.
        I’ve never read it but now that you mention it, a lot of his dialogue I think is improved slightly by not imagining him say it. Like just it on paper
    That’s why he was punished by having to be the ambassadors guard on the “fart planet” which is the homeworld of the Unggoy following the war.
    Yeah. The things that make people not like Mickey at least make him a compelling character. Romeo is just an asshole.
        Romeo his constant running of his mouth.. complaining just to Complain.. in the skyline mission just always annoyed me more than Mickey's betrayal in the future... i can kinda understand his pov on his choice after he got Rookie killed because of his Decision to NOT kill a human
            Romeo just really does not want to be out there, last I checked he'd rather be either Sniping numb-nuts at range or seducing ladies. Urban Combat sucks major balls.

And I don't blame him since *he's the guy who got Shwacked with the back of a gravity hammer* and suffered internal bleeding in his lungs because of it. The man obviously likes having 200+ meters between him and whatever he's been sent to kill.
    Same, I got annoyed with him immediately with the "What am I supposed to do with this inside a Covenant ship?!" It's only one of the best weapons in the game and saved my ass during Halo in the Truth and Reconciliation.
        For sure. That’s just a smart comment to be a smart comment. ODSTs are the best of the best and should act like it. Sure they can have personalities, but Halo 3 ODST turned that up to 11.
    Agreed
    Yeah, but Romeo basically got exiled to Balaho for sleeping with an Admiral's wife. He's kinda like the Tucker from RvB of the ODST squad.
Mickey. Bitch ass traitor
Dare. Who doesn't tell their squad about a change in the mission when the operation commences?
    ONI, ONI does. ONI has a bad record of not properly informing or informing groups or organizations of things at all in the lore.
        Accurate to real life ONI.
    Intelligence-based decisions in the military are often like that.
    Dare.
    this, and let’s be honest, nobody would like dare if she didn’t have recon zzz
    Don't trust a spook to lead the ops
        Amen.
Mickey. You know why.
    All my New Blood homies hate Mickey
Rookie, he reminds me too much of myself and I kinda hate that guy
    The strong, silent type? Loud ass pansy
Mickey, aside from the whole "betrayal of the squad" thing in the books. I just found him rather annoying in the game. Really? Son of a gun? That's the best you've got. Also where do you THINK the fight is at genius.

Also why the hell does Dutch have to arm the explosives? That's literally YOUR freaking job.

His level itself was pretty fun though.
    This is complete fax ^

That being said Dutch, buck and Romeo levels are better
        Oh definitely agree everyone else's levels were better. Mickey's was still just me mechanically fun.

Honestly both of Dutch's levels were my favorite.
Mickey because obvious.
Buck > Rookie > Dutch > Romeo > Dare > Mickey
    The official lineup. Except Virgil and the golden hunter are ahead of Mickey
        Virgil is ahead of everyone
            Yeah, you passed 🫡
        The golden hunter?
    Good to see my boy Dutch in top 3
    L

Buck > Romeo > Rookie > Dare > Dutch > Mickey
Mickey one hundred percent
Just from playing the game and not reading any books it’d be mickey I honestly find him super forgettable like I can name a good scene with every other character other than him
    Like, seriously, you play as him, right? I honestly can't remember a single scene with him
        You might play as him if at any point you do I can’t remeber
        Kzingo Blvd
Romeo. I know he's the sniper and got injured, but he was just annoying to me.
mickey, traitor bastard
correction, its romeo because hes so anoying , my all time Favorite is dutch , he has the best lines , is a nice guy, and has the laser 😂
    As your least favorite?
        ah , crap, i fucked up with the Translation 😳😅 hes my all time Favorite, most hated is romeo because hes so anoying
Mickey was honestly forgettable in the game imo, struck me as “that guy with the hair and face,” and that was before reading what happens… well… later.
Mickley cus he's a fucking TRAITOR!
Rookie because he's literally not a character
    Well, he technically could have been if they had iterated on his experiences in *Dirt*, but alas.
    He's the player you silly goose
        Some people hate themselves 😂😂
        Exactly, not a character.
            I assume you feel the same about Noble 6? And any other character that you play as yourself?
                Yes? Although even Noble 6 gets some voice lines to personalize them a bit, Rookie has zilch.
                    I mean, when the character is supposed to be you, it's easier to have the character not speak as opposed to doing a Mass Effect style dialog option. Halo has never needed that.
                        Yes. That doesn't really have anything to do with the fact that I don't care about him because he's not a character.
                            Sure. But he is a character. The protagonist is quite literally the main character. Your option is you don't like him, the fact is he is a character.
                                Not really.
    This is blasphemy, prepare to be glassed innie!
From the game Romeo. Didn't like his attitude. 

From the books Mickey, as he got Rookie killed.
Mickey... Treacherous bastard whore son
Dare.

Like honestly, you land on humanity's homeworld, currently being invaded by genocidal aliens and the first thing you do is bitch about your ex boy friend???
In the game Def Romeo cause he's just an ass, after hearing about Mickey though it's Def him
Mickey. Make up your mind man.
Mickey that little shit!
Micky.

>!That fucking traitor.!<
Mickey not because of that dumbass book, just the least interesting imo. Idk why people hating on Romeo tho, he’s got charm and wit
    “- the hell am I supposed to do with this (wit) *inside* a Covenant ship?”
Based on the game? Buck. 

Based on the game and books? Buck and Romeo, with a splash of Mickey, Dutch, and Dare.
    Finally someone says Buck. Buck is cheesy AF in the game and Nathan Fillion is annoying to me because he is basically the same character in anything does.

Haven’t read the book so im sure that’s different because it isn’t Nathan Fillion
        My answer, my reason for posting this, is because I’ve realized recently that Buck is annoying and whiny. I don’t think his character makes sense for an infantry sergeant.
    Coastal Highway on Legendary made me hate Buck

Like he’d have a clear shot on a Banshee with a gauss turret and just…wouldn’t shoot. I’d have to drive back and forth hoping I’d hit the sweet spot where his AI would start shooting, and by that point Dare would already be blown up
Hot take but Rookie is such a non character, he’s just a vessel for the player.
    His death was perfect cause it showed how war doesn’t care who you are. It just takes lives without warning or ceremony
        Then do it in a game, not a fucking book
            Master Chief’s whole ass origin story is in a book, and it came out before CE. If you can’t be bothered to read that’s nobody’s problem but yours
                And yet it's completely and totally irrelevant to the Bungie games.
                    •_•
            They did that in Reach, doing it again with a less important ODST would just be lame
        I think Johnson just dying due to an "accident" conveys that better. He was an absolute fucking badass and seemed invincible

Then his internal organs got friend unexpectedly and his body is impossible to recover. At least he got a few sentences out before he went
            I mean, that too. Not like it’s a competition
Mickey before the betrayal. Most forgettable-ass character in all of Halo. But after the betrayal, he actually became nuanced and interesting
I always really liked Dutch.
    Yes, but who do you *dislike*?
        I misread. Mickey.
Dare, she doesn’t use an ODST helmet, yes that’s the only reason and yes it’s valid
    RIP Road To Recon
I'm the only person here that likes Mickey...even after reading the books...
Pre novels, Romeo. dude’s obnoxious and I’m glad he got humbled with a hammer to the chest. Post novels, fuck you Mickey. FUCK YOU.
Mickey. Stupid traitor who joined the very side that murdered his squadmate and friend in cold blood. Fuck that guy with a full load from a Needler.
Mickey, not even bc of the obvious, he’s just a bit boring.

People saying Romeo can fuck off, Romeo the goat
Mickey

    Y’all already know why
Dare.

You come into MY uppity squad of honest hell-jumpers, tell ALL of us that we're going to do what you say or get shot ALL without giving ANY of us a single detail on what the hell you're out here for.

God damn ONI spooks, I get why Buck is so irritable about her.
rookie. 
iz me
Mickey his jokes and commentary are annoying
Mickey. Fuck that guy. R.I.P Rookie!!!
Mickey, he betrayed them and killed Rookie.
    He didn't kill Rookie. IIRC he didn't even become an insurrectionist until AFTER Rookie died
    That's about the wrongest, most misleading way you could have put that.
    I swear the people saying this either didn't read the book or didn't understand the story.
    How did he betray them and get rookie killed?
In terms of the game I would say Rookie as he has no character. Strong silent type.

If I had to pick besides him then I would say Mickey due to the books.
After hearing what happened in New Blood  mickey for sure. 

But more to the point. 

Can we all give a shoutout to my man, Dutch, for being the only person who hasn't been nominated as least favorite. (Not yet anyways)
 Within the game probably Dutch. I'd say Romeo but I identify too much with him (I felt that when he bitched about taking the stairs). 

 Within the whole of the narrative it's gonna be Micky. His heart was in the right place, but his head was up his ass. I don't necessarily dislike any of the characters from Alpha-Nine though
    u/Forward_Juggernaut

This post, right here, officer. A DUTCH HATER
Dare cos I cant even remember them lol
    Dang, no road to Recon 😂
Nicky, the traitor
Rookie-doesn’t talk, just shoot
The Rookie, and it's not even a contest. He's literally not even a character. The most interesting thing he did is die
Mickey. Fucking traitor.
I forget Romeo exists. But Mickey is… Mickey. Rookie is the GOAT.
Rookie cause he held me back during the campaign
Rookie is my least favorite because he has no character whatsoever
Rookie, he kept getting killed by jackelals
Mickey cause he’s a god damn traitor!

Nah all jokes aside I love them all, but Rookie’s gotta take the bottom cause he’s not much of an actual character, he’s just the player. Still love the guy though
Dutch, because he's played by Adam Baldwin.
    Same. It's a shame he turned out to be a shitbag because he had great characters, but he's _such_ a shitbag it's difficult to separate them.

Also as usual, reddit thread asking for subjective opinions, but actually there's only one opinion you're allowed to have
    Is he a dickhead in real life? He usually plays assholes in his movie roles so maybe he’s a natural
    What’s wrong with Baldwin?
I only know him from FMJ, Halo 3, and ODST
        He's written columns for Breitbart

He's very pro gamergate, even implying that Brianna Wu was lying about getting death threats.

He's a climate change denier.

He's antivax.

He's all in on "political correctness is why society sucks"

He's anti-abortion.

Just overall a shitty person.
            O O F 

That’s pretty not-good (to me)

Maybe he *is* an Animal Mother
        Nothing is wrong with Adam, he's a talented actor and voice actor. He does a great job of Dutch.
            I mean he was an avid GamerGater (was the one who coined the term) and pretty frequently makes homophobic, racist, etc. comments. Plenty wrong with him depending on what your beliefs are.
                Oh dear, I did not know that. Well....
I’ve been thinking about it lately, and I realized that I think I’ve always felt that Buck was annoying. 

I think the characters work well in the narrative story-telling aspect of the game, but I think that Buck just doesn’t feel like an ODST sergeant.
    Damn that’s a hot take. 

Buck is great. Nathan Fillion is brilliant, and a treasure in Halo, Destiny, etc.
        I wish I could give you an award, but you know, reddit fucked that up.
        How is Nathan Fillion brilliant? He plays the same character in every role he plays.
            Boo this man. 

Cayde-6 and Buck are wildly different. 

Then add in his newest character John Nolan
    I kinda agree actually. I love the character, but he's not the average special forces NCO. No big deal though, still a good character.
    I get what you’re saying, as a standard odst he’d do much more, but the non canon reason is bungee devs loved a show he was in prior where he was a captain
        I agree. That’s why I said for the narrative story, he’s fine, but as a spec ops infantry sergeant, he doesn’t make sense.
I hate 343 industries lol. At this point they’re the the greatest villain in the series
    Odst was made by Bungie???
        Apparently a 343-era book makes Mickey turn insurrectionist
            Oh well I did some brief reading on it, and what's so bad about it
                It was a terrible writing decision that just unecessarily shits on bungie lore. The answer to this question is Mickey. Which is a result of 343s actions. And honestly I was just venting lol this picture triggered me. I hate 343 in general
        I know lol
I just did the campaign on Legendary for the first time last year and honestly couldn't name any aside from Buck lmao
Romeo cause after playing uncharted I could not see that voice as a black man
    I don't remember his voice but he got an ugly fucking mug for someone named Romeo lmao
Dare, she just doesn’t fit in and she thinks just because she walked in she can define what the squad is and the culture in it.
    Meh, she’s a ranking intelligence authority that took over the squad for a secret mission. That happens in the military.
        Still she adds nothing and only takes, she’s a cancer everyone else is based.
            She made the squad partake in a mission more important to saving humanity than ‘boarding a ship and killing Covenant’ 🤷🏻‍♂️
                I do kind of love that people have this opinion of Date though. You're not wrong, that's how it happens in military operations sometimes (kinda assuming here). But I wouldn't expect the people on the team to actually **like** that person though lol. So when someone talks about not liking Dare I feel like they just got perfectly immersed in being the Rookie.
Dare. It's better to be a traitor like Mickey than an Oni operative like Dare. She joins the squad, takes over, expects cooperation, doesn't tell anyone even the smallest detail of the real mission until one of them finds out by himself (not even a lie to make antrjing make sense), and she's working for the worst people in all of Halo. Even the prophets are better people(?) and they were ready to knowingly kill the whole galaxy because admitting they were wrong would have probably minor consequences. She's also just a bitch, but that might just be part of being Oni
DARE
Reason:
Woman
I honestly remembered everyone but dare
Ok I’d say buck because I hate his love problems but fuck Mickey
It’s gotta be Mickey for me he just blends into the background compared to the other members
Dare.... She's just so friggin' annoying....
Fuck Mickey
Just based on the game cause I haven’t seen any of the books or anything, Dare. She lied to the team and essentially abandoned them for the mission she kept hidden.
    True, but that’s what intelligence divisions in militaries do. If they told the squads/soldiers the truth, it would hinder the security of the missions/information.
Gotta be Romeo, nothing personal but he just seems stuck up. Hell of a Sniper tho. Everyone else seems fun, even DARE. What about Virgil??
    Virgil is a QT: no question
Dare. Sounds bossy and doesn’t like the rookie
    She's ONI, what do you expect?
        Still don’t like her
As someone who has never read New Blood, what does Mickey do in it to garner this hate?
    He apparently causes the death of one of the characters
    Froze up & got the self-insert killed. Later joined the rebels.
Dare
Romeo by far. I’m all about that long range low ammo high impact.
    As your *least* favorite?
        My bad. Mickey. I don’t remember a single thing about him
Dare is annoying as shit
Romeo. He's just kind of a dick, and not even in a way that makes him an interesting character. The opening cutscene of NMPD HQ really shows that. I'm not saying he deserved to get stabbed with a gravity hammer, but I'm also not saying he didn't deserve it.
Mickey, probably because we didn’t get much time with him.
I’d need to replay it to find out who it is now, but I remember it being Dare the first time I played.
Buck <3
Rookie
The one on the left. The Recon helmet makes them look like a bobble head. Also this isn’t the regular recon helmet from halo 3 is it? I remember it looking so much cooler! This looks like the ugly one that’s in infinite
Buck because he's assisting in the capture of my boy Master Chief
Buck, New Blood makes him unbearably annoying. Mickey should’ve killed him and peaced out
Dare. She just gave off that "I'm better than everyone" feeling.
dare because she wasnt very present throughout most of the levels

liked her armor though
Mickey, not cause of novels, but because I always forget about him.
Mickey all the way, just look at him. 
I still do a lil countdown here and there especially at red lights. 
Tank beats everything!

🤟✌🏼☝️✊🏼

Ooooh my bad I thought it said favorite 😂
    Well, who’s your *least* favorite?

The counting down thing is cool! I need to start doing that
        Go for it, it’s nice when you get it. 
But I thought it said FAVORITE lmao 
But least would probably be Dutch cause he’s old. I know that’s a horrible reason but I honestly like all of em.
            🥴😂

Sgt. Johnson is old, DO YOU HATE HIM?!
I never liked mickey. Even before you-know-what.
Buck. He seems like he wants to kill bad guys and go home, but the bad guys never end, and hes kinda tired of it all
Dutch was a real one and I loved Rookie but um...😔
Dare.  
The entire events of ODST could've been avoided if she wasn't a stuck up bitch towards buck
They did Mickey so dirty for no reason
*It's coming up, it's coming up, it's coming up, it's coming it's coming up, it's coming up...*

#It's Dare

*ohh~*
before it was Dare, then after all these years Mickey
we need new odst content, to move on from this depressive hole
Well dare has less screen time
The rookie he just like six
If your answer ISN’T Mickey, you can’t be a trooper.
I read the books and actually dislike romeo more than mickey because mickey was doing what he thought was right but romeo was shown to be rude all the time, just rubbed me wrong. Dutch is my favorite, salt of the earth
Mickey, and i think we all know why
Mickey, even before the heel turn. In-game he was just kinda forgettable
Mackey because he's a traitor.
Romeo by far.
Fuck Mickey.
Mickey
Romeo cause hes an asshole all the time
Definitely Micky. He used to be one of my favourites, but after New Blood, fuck Micky
“And why is it Mickey?” Is how the question should’ve ended lol
Dutch, purely, pettily, and baselessly because adam baldwin's lines in uplift reserve got annoying to hear grunted for the umpteenth time lmao
    u/Forward_Juggernaut

This post, right here, officer. A DUTCH HATER
*Soulful somber jazz noises*



PS The Rookie Lives!
Literally all of them except Buck. He is the only one that actually matters.
Mickey, because... reasons...
Never beaten Odst because i cant get pass first mission. 

Too damn confusing where to go
I always thought Mickey was annoying, and then New Blood happened... my opinion quickly escalated from annoyed to pure hatred.
Imagine if they remastered this like they did with halo 2
Buck - Nathan Fillion - nuff said.
    U don’t like Nathan Fillion?
        ohhh I totally misread that! Thank you! Buck is my favorite. Least I'll say Mickey because of the book.
Dare
I don't think I have a least favorite odst in Alpha-Nine.
Rookie duh
Mickey. He annoyed me a little from the get go, but his motivation in new blood just made no damn sense to me.
Dare, i just don’t like the character. Can’t specify, just doesn’t vibe with me I guess
I refuse to read that stupid fucking book so it's Romeo
I just li ok rookie….i dont know just seems like a alright guy…can I can just feel his pain just watching buck and dare…oh wait this is *least favourite* ohh….Romeo
I hate myself and Rookie is literally me.



so Rookie
Dutch because he paraphrases the bible the way in which Jesus intended.
    “Amen”
Buck. I call him Fuck. Killed “maybe one or two” Huragok my ass.
Dutch… naw I just kidding, fuck Mickey
Not taking into account the books, my least favourite is Dare. None of the characters are bad, some have their ups and downs but I found Dare to be the least likeable. She came across as a badass for the sake of it, a secret Oni affiliate who won't tell you the mission and still expects everyone to respect them and take orders. She becomes more likeable towards the end with Virgil and Buck but the first half of the game... eh.
Mickey without a doubt.
Mickey
I like the strong, silent type.
    But who do you *dislike*?
dare
Obviously Mickey  
but i'm surprised by how many people dislike Romeo.  
Like i understand he's annoying, but i think that works well with the story.  
Everyone is tired of him, but like it or not they're a team, so they \*have\* to work together.  
I think it just makes the ODSTs that much more human.
Bro I can’t keep defending Mickey he is my favorite 😭
without counting New Blood.  
for me is Veronica, i find her whole Oni mission completely unecessary for the plot. you can excise it from the game and it will probably be a good game. 

many people dislike Romeo, but i feel his role really fitting with the setting,  sure hes an asshole but he also got a brute cheiftain hammer-axe blow to the chest so its balanced.
FUCK MICKEY, no back bone, no bitches, no demolish rizz just trash.
In the game itself? Romeo is my least favorite. He’s a dickhead. In the lore? Probably Mickey for being a traitor to the UNSC.
Mickey. He betrayed the trust in his brothers.
Dare because she’s a damn spook.
Rookie has like zero character so him.
Romeo cus he always questioned orders
Probably Romeo like everybody else. I still enjoy him, just not as much as the others. 

I also dislike how their fates were decided in some book rather than getting another game or even a film/series.
Excluding Mickey next i dont really know who to induct because the others didnt betray and kill the Rookie, but in ODST game they all did good maybe Dare but not by much, its just like dang we know youre good but no need to lone wolf it aside from that shes cool
Aside from mickey, its romeo. He is just an asshole. In the games hes just kindve a douche but in the book he is perhaps the most insensitive human being on earth
I like all of them but why you gotta do that to our boy Mickey? Rookie didn’t deserve that.
I know it's basic but rookie
Definitely Dare. Obviously just kind of tacked on to the squad and overall just an annoying character blaming Buck for all her screw-ups.
Definitely Dare. Obviously just kind of tacked on to the squad and overall just an annoying character blaming Buck for all her screw-ups.
Mickey for spoiler reasons I can’t say. Just read the book new blood.
Mickey, he's a traitor
What did he do again? Oh right, didn’t he turn on them?
    And got rookie killed. I feel 343 management likes to waste story telling and game potential on purpose.
        what stories could have been done with rookie that couldn’t be replaced by generic odst #30385?
            The problem isn't inherently him dying, it's that they did it in a fucking book
                Tbf, how do you have a game with Rookie without you playing as him? He's a silent protagonist. 

So the only real issue from a gameplay standpoint isn't there - it's just the "why would you kill the player character avatar of a group in a fan driven media empire?"

It's a wider problem of the Halo 4-5 era: so many important things happen off screen in a book. And unlike Mass Effect (which had a similar issue) you can just do a simple exposition dump with a character explaining everything the vast majority of gamers who focus on standalone book empires if they read books at all.
                    Not just 4-5 era, Rubicon Protocol and Shadows of Reach are squarely in Infinite era. They’re still forwarding the plot in major ways offscreen.
                        Ah yes, I love having the most exciting thing to happen to the UNSC occur immediately before I start playing a game where I now have to pick up the pieces in set pieces that are no where near comparable to the destruction of the biggest vessel in the UNSC fleet.
            One where rookie goes to a coffee shop and talks about his unique life experiences?
                > talks

can’t happen
                    He walks into the coffee shop, gives the cashier the exact amount of money for what he wants, and when he picks up his order he starts having flashbacks from someone else's POV about his own life.
                    One where he thinks?
                        i mean yeah he could think, not sure how you’d make an interesting halo story where one guy thinks sometimes
            Because the Rookie has character traits that are shown to the player rather than told. He has a history that can be referenced and used to inform his decision making. He's a blank slate in that we don't know specifics about him, but he has a character that relied exclusively on showing and not telling.
                Not only that, but he was the camera through which we experienced ODST, even when you play as the other characters it's in a flashback after he finds something. So naturally the players are going to develop an attachment regardless of if he says anything, in fact him not saying anything is even better because it lets the atmosphere and the scenery tell the story.

His situation in the game is he woke up 9 hours after drop, the battle has already been fought and lost, he doesn't know where his squad is or if they're even alive, and the city is swarming with covies, mix that with the rain and that sweet sweet sax music and the detective noir aspect where he looks for clues, all the while finding areas where people made their last stand along the way. Beautiful story telling through the environment and atmosphere alone, and he is the lens through which the player experiences it.

Doomguy never said a damn thing either (until recently), and he was loved even before the 2016 game, just because the protagonist is silent doesn't mean they don't have character, actions speak louder than words.
Also something like 70% of communication is body language, you can mostly guess what he's feeling, what he's thinking during the cutscenes based on his movement and the way he carries himself, truly they did an outstanding job with him.
            Aside from killing off a player character. 

Who says he has to stay an odst? Why couldn't he go spartan4 and be playable in spartan ops in h4?
            Anything better than you ever written, that's for sure.
                Idk how to cook or bake but I can easily tell when someone put dog turd between two buns and called it a sandvich, you don't need to be an expert to criticize

And they didn't say the book was bad, they said 343 wastes interesting hooks and it's true
                bruh what i’m literally not a writer lmao, that’s not exactly a high bar
                Going after the guy saying it won't transform bad 343 writing into good
        Brian reed approved
            That bastard was the start of the fall. You could argue that escalation was the catalyst.. being right after 4, and right when Reed took over, but wow he really goofed up a ton of projects. How he kept getting greenlit is beyond me.
        Actually wouldn't mind that story getting retconned a bit.
            “Somehow, the Rookie returned”
        I mean it’s a book, right? So couldn’t they ever con it, or at least change some of it so that buck still becomes a spartan (I haven’t played 5 that’s all I know) but
        343's storytelling is horrible, they're making the distiny mistake of rushing to show everything instead of leaving some mystery to players' imagination, as well as making strange story decisions that just seem like generic story beats incorporating any named character they can find and subsequently kind of ruining them...

that being said, there's still nothing getting close to touching the kilo 5 trilogy
        Died like a rookie too lol
        >And got rookie killed. I feel 343 management likes to waste story telling and game potential on purpose.

 Just because it made you mad doesn't mean the writing was bad or whatever. The entire cast of ODST is honestly a bunch of undisciplined shit heels so everything going badly wasn't all that surprising at all.
            [removed]
                lol honey your acct is gonna get suspended
                    Good

Also, there's only one c in act go back to primary
        rookie's death was before mickey's defection
            Yes but it was his hesitation to shoot an Innie that allowed said Innie to shoot Rookie in the head.

Like that is actual guilt Mickey was carrying about that.
                shit you're right, sorry lol
        Rookie wasn’t a character. 

He had less character than the odst that walks up to you at the start of delta halo

Less than any of the marines featured in any of the games
        Would've loved that as a Halo 5 spin off dlc campaign.
Yeah, natch. 👍
Yeah fuck >!Mickey!<
This
No
All my homies hate Mickey.
I just finished bad blood yesterday, if you haven’t read it, it’s crazy! Might give you a second opinion but that honestly is the correct choice, only by a little bit. It’s hard to hate Alpha 9.
Agreed. He is tolerable in the Helljumper comics because you get his internal monologue but it did not translate well to the game.
    I’ve never read it but now that you mention it, a lot of his dialogue I think is improved slightly by not imagining him say it. Like just it on paper
That’s why he was punished by having to be the ambassadors guard on the “fart planet” which is the homeworld of the Unggoy following the war.
Yeah. The things that make people not like Mickey at least make him a compelling character. Romeo is just an asshole.
    Romeo his constant running of his mouth.. complaining just to Complain.. in the skyline mission just always annoyed me more than Mickey's betrayal in the future... i can kinda understand his pov on his choice after he got Rookie killed because of his Decision to NOT kill a human
        Romeo just really does not want to be out there, last I checked he'd rather be either Sniping numb-nuts at range or seducing ladies. Urban Combat sucks major balls.

And I don't blame him since *he's the guy who got Shwacked with the back of a gravity hammer* and suffered internal bleeding in his lungs because of it. The man obviously likes having 200+ meters between him and whatever he's been sent to kill.
Same, I got annoyed with him immediately with the "What am I supposed to do with this inside a Covenant ship?!" It's only one of the best weapons in the game and saved my ass during Halo in the Truth and Reconciliation.
    For sure. That’s just a smart comment to be a smart comment. ODSTs are the best of the best and should act like it. Sure they can have personalities, but Halo 3 ODST turned that up to 11.
Agreed
Yeah, but Romeo basically got exiled to Balaho for sleeping with an Admiral's wife. He's kinda like the Tucker from RvB of the ODST squad.
ONI, ONI does. ONI has a bad record of not properly informing or informing groups or organizations of things at all in the lore.
    Accurate to real life ONI.
Intelligence-based decisions in the military are often like that.
Dare.
this, and let’s be honest, nobody would like dare if she didn’t have recon zzz
Don't trust a spook to lead the ops
    Amen.
All my New Blood homies hate Mickey
The strong, silent type? Loud ass pansy
This is complete fax ^

That being said Dutch, buck and Romeo levels are better
    Oh definitely agree everyone else's levels were better. Mickey's was still just me mechanically fun.

Honestly both of Dutch's levels were my favorite.
The official lineup. Except Virgil and the golden hunter are ahead of Mickey
    Virgil is ahead of everyone
        Yeah, you passed 🫡
    The golden hunter?
Good to see my boy Dutch in top 3
L

Buck > Romeo > Rookie > Dare > Dutch > Mickey
Like, seriously, you play as him, right? I honestly can't remember a single scene with him
    You might play as him if at any point you do I can’t remeber
    Kzingo Blvd
As your least favorite?
    ah , crap, i fucked up with the Translation 😳😅 hes my all time Favorite, most hated is romeo because hes so anoying
Well, he technically could have been if they had iterated on his experiences in *Dirt*, but alas.
He's the player you silly goose
    Some people hate themselves 😂😂
    Exactly, not a character.
        I assume you feel the same about Noble 6? And any other character that you play as yourself?
            Yes? Although even Noble 6 gets some voice lines to personalize them a bit, Rookie has zilch.
                I mean, when the character is supposed to be you, it's easier to have the character not speak as opposed to doing a Mass Effect style dialog option. Halo has never needed that.
                    Yes. That doesn't really have anything to do with the fact that I don't care about him because he's not a character.
                        Sure. But he is a character. The protagonist is quite literally the main character. Your option is you don't like him, the fact is he is a character.
                            Not really.
This is blasphemy, prepare to be glassed innie!
“- the hell am I supposed to do with this (wit) *inside* a Covenant ship?”
Finally someone says Buck. Buck is cheesy AF in the game and Nathan Fillion is annoying to me because he is basically the same character in anything does.

Haven’t read the book so im sure that’s different because it isn’t Nathan Fillion
    My answer, my reason for posting this, is because I’ve realized recently that Buck is annoying and whiny. I don’t think his character makes sense for an infantry sergeant.
Coastal Highway on Legendary made me hate Buck

Like he’d have a clear shot on a Banshee with a gauss turret and just…wouldn’t shoot. I’d have to drive back and forth hoping I’d hit the sweet spot where his AI would start shooting, and by that point Dare would already be blown up
His death was perfect cause it showed how war doesn’t care who you are. It just takes lives without warning or ceremony
    Then do it in a game, not a fucking book
        Master Chief’s whole ass origin story is in a book, and it came out before CE. If you can’t be bothered to read that’s nobody’s problem but yours
            And yet it's completely and totally irrelevant to the Bungie games.
                •_•
        They did that in Reach, doing it again with a less important ODST would just be lame
    I think Johnson just dying due to an "accident" conveys that better. He was an absolute fucking badass and seemed invincible

Then his internal organs got friend unexpectedly and his body is impossible to recover. At least he got a few sentences out before he went
        I mean, that too. Not like it’s a competition
Yes, but who do you *dislike*?
    I misread. Mickey.
RIP Road To Recon
He didn't kill Rookie. IIRC he didn't even become an insurrectionist until AFTER Rookie died
That's about the wrongest, most misleading way you could have put that.
I swear the people saying this either didn't read the book or didn't understand the story.
How did he betray them and get rookie killed?
u/Forward_Juggernaut

This post, right here, officer. A DUTCH HATER
Dang, no road to Recon 😂
Same. It's a shame he turned out to be a shitbag because he had great characters, but he's _such_ a shitbag it's difficult to separate them.

Also as usual, reddit thread asking for subjective opinions, but actually there's only one opinion you're allowed to have
Is he a dickhead in real life? He usually plays assholes in his movie roles so maybe he’s a natural
What’s wrong with Baldwin?
I only know him from FMJ, Halo 3, and ODST
    He's written columns for Breitbart

He's very pro gamergate, even implying that Brianna Wu was lying about getting death threats.

He's a climate change denier.

He's antivax.

He's all in on "political correctness is why society sucks"

He's anti-abortion.

Just overall a shitty person.
        O O F 

That’s pretty not-good (to me)

Maybe he *is* an Animal Mother
    Nothing is wrong with Adam, he's a talented actor and voice actor. He does a great job of Dutch.
        I mean he was an avid GamerGater (was the one who coined the term) and pretty frequently makes homophobic, racist, etc. comments. Plenty wrong with him depending on what your beliefs are.
            Oh dear, I did not know that. Well....
Damn that’s a hot take. 

Buck is great. Nathan Fillion is brilliant, and a treasure in Halo, Destiny, etc.
    I wish I could give you an award, but you know, reddit fucked that up.
    How is Nathan Fillion brilliant? He plays the same character in every role he plays.
        Boo this man. 

Cayde-6 and Buck are wildly different. 

Then add in his newest character John Nolan
I kinda agree actually. I love the character, but he's not the average special forces NCO. No big deal though, still a good character.
I get what you’re saying, as a standard odst he’d do much more, but the non canon reason is bungee devs loved a show he was in prior where he was a captain
    I agree. That’s why I said for the narrative story, he’s fine, but as a spec ops infantry sergeant, he doesn’t make sense.
Odst was made by Bungie???
    Apparently a 343-era book makes Mickey turn insurrectionist
        Oh well I did some brief reading on it, and what's so bad about it
            It was a terrible writing decision that just unecessarily shits on bungie lore. The answer to this question is Mickey. Which is a result of 343s actions. And honestly I was just venting lol this picture triggered me. I hate 343 in general
    I know lol
I don't remember his voice but he got an ugly fucking mug for someone named Romeo lmao
Meh, she’s a ranking intelligence authority that took over the squad for a secret mission. That happens in the military.
    Still she adds nothing and only takes, she’s a cancer everyone else is based.
        She made the squad partake in a mission more important to saving humanity than ‘boarding a ship and killing Covenant’ 🤷🏻‍♂️
            I do kind of love that people have this opinion of Date though. You're not wrong, that's how it happens in military operations sometimes (kinda assuming here). But I wouldn't expect the people on the team to actually **like** that person though lol. So when someone talks about not liking Dare I feel like they just got perfectly immersed in being the Rookie.
True, but that’s what intelligence divisions in militaries do. If they told the squads/soldiers the truth, it would hinder the security of the missions/information.
Virgil is a QT: no question
She's ONI, what do you expect?
    Still don’t like her
He apparently causes the death of one of the characters
Froze up & got the self-insert killed. Later joined the rebels.
As your *least* favorite?
    My bad. Mickey. I don’t remember a single thing about him
Well, who’s your *least* favorite?

The counting down thing is cool! I need to start doing that
    Go for it, it’s nice when you get it. 
But I thought it said FAVORITE lmao 
But least would probably be Dutch cause he’s old. I know that’s a horrible reason but I honestly like all of em.
        🥴😂

Sgt. Johnson is old, DO YOU HATE HIM?!
u/Forward_Juggernaut

This post, right here, officer. A DUTCH HATER
U don’t like Nathan Fillion?
    ohhh I totally misread that! Thank you! Buck is my favorite. Least I'll say Mickey because of the book.
“Amen”
But who do you *dislike*?
And got rookie killed. I feel 343 management likes to waste story telling and game potential on purpose.

He's antivax.

He's all in on "political correctness is why society sucks"

He's anti-abortion.

Just overall a shitty person.
    O O F 

That’s pretty not-good (to me)

Maybe he *is* an Animal Mother
Nothing is wrong with Adam, he's a talented actor and voice actor. He does a great job of Dutch.
    I mean he was an avid GamerGater (was the one who coined the term) and pretty frequently makes homophobic, racist, etc. comments. Plenty wrong with him depending on what your beliefs are.
        Oh dear, I did not know that. Well....
I wish I could give you an award, but you know, reddit fucked that up.
How is Nathan Fillion brilliant? He plays the same character in every role he plays.
    Boo this man. 

Cayde-6 and Buck are wildly different. 

Then add in his newest character John Nolan
I agree. That’s why I said for the narrative story, he’s fine, but as a spec ops infantry sergeant, he doesn’t make sense.
Apparently a 343-era book makes Mickey turn insurrectionist
    Oh well I did some brief reading on it, and what's so bad about it
        It was a terrible writing decision that just unecessarily shits on bungie lore. The answer to this question is Mickey. Which is a result of 343s actions. And honestly I was just venting lol this picture triggered me. I hate 343 in general
I know lol
Still she adds nothing and only takes, she’s a cancer everyone else is based.
    She made the squad partake in a mission more important to saving humanity than ‘boarding a ship and killing Covenant’ 🤷🏻‍♂️
        I do kind of love that people have this opinion of Date though. You're not wrong, that's how it happens in military operations sometimes (kinda assuming here). But I wouldn't expect the people on the team to actually **like** that person though lol. So when someone talks about not liking Dare I feel like they just got perfectly immersed in being the Rookie.
Still don’t like her
My bad. Mickey. I don’t remember a single thing about him
Go for it, it’s nice when you get it. 
But I thought it said FAVORITE lmao 
But least would probably be Dutch cause he’s old. I know that’s a horrible reason but I honestly like all of em.
    🥴😂

Sgt. Johnson is old, DO YOU HATE HIM?!
ohhh I totally misread that! Thank you! Buck is my favorite. Least I'll say Mickey because of the book.
what stories could have been done with rookie that couldn’t be replaced by generic odst #30385?
    The problem isn't inherently him dying, it's that they did it in a fucking book
        Tbf, how do you have a game with Rookie without you playing as him? He's a silent protagonist. 

So the only real issue from a gameplay standpoint isn't there - it's just the "why would you kill the player character avatar of a group in a fan driven media empire?"

It's a wider problem of the Halo 4-5 era: so many important things happen off screen in a book. And unlike Mass Effect (which had a similar issue) you can just do a simple exposition dump with a character explaining everything the vast majority of gamers who focus on standalone book empires if they read books at all.
            Not just 4-5 era, Rubicon Protocol and Shadows of Reach are squarely in Infinite era. They’re still forwarding the plot in major ways offscreen.
                Ah yes, I love having the most exciting thing to happen to the UNSC occur immediately before I start playing a game where I now have to pick up the pieces in set pieces that are no where near comparable to the destruction of the biggest vessel in the UNSC fleet.
    One where rookie goes to a coffee shop and talks about his unique life experiences?
        > talks

can’t happen
            He walks into the coffee shop, gives the cashier the exact amount of money for what he wants, and when he picks up his order he starts having flashbacks from someone else's POV about his own life.
            One where he thinks?
                i mean yeah he could think, not sure how you’d make an interesting halo story where one guy thinks sometimes
    Because the Rookie has character traits that are shown to the player rather than told. He has a history that can be referenced and used to inform his decision making. He's a blank slate in that we don't know specifics about him, but he has a character that relied exclusively on showing and not telling.
        Not only that, but he was the camera through which we experienced ODST, even when you play as the other characters it's in a flashback after he finds something. So naturally the players are going to develop an attachment regardless of if he says anything, in fact him not saying anything is even better because it lets the atmosphere and the scenery tell the story.

His situation in the game is he woke up 9 hours after drop, the battle has already been fought and lost, he doesn't know where his squad is or if they're even alive, and the city is swarming with covies, mix that with the rain and that sweet sweet sax music and the detective noir aspect where he looks for clues, all the while finding areas where people made their last stand along the way. Beautiful story telling through the environment and atmosphere alone, and he is the lens through which the player experiences it.

Doomguy never said a damn thing either (until recently), and he was loved even before the 2016 game, just because the protagonist is silent doesn't mean they don't have character, actions speak louder than words.
Also something like 70% of communication is body language, you can mostly guess what he's feeling, what he's thinking during the cutscenes based on his movement and the way he carries himself, truly they did an outstanding job with him.
    Aside from killing off a player character. 

Who says he has to stay an odst? Why couldn't he go spartan4 and be playable in spartan ops in h4?
    Anything better than you ever written, that's for sure.
        Idk how to cook or bake but I can easily tell when someone put dog turd between two buns and called it a sandvich, you don't need to be an expert to criticize

And they didn't say the book was bad, they said 343 wastes interesting hooks and it's true
        bruh what i’m literally not a writer lmao, that’s not exactly a high bar
        Going after the guy saying it won't transform bad 343 writing into good
Brian reed approved
    That bastard was the start of the fall. You could argue that escalation was the catalyst.. being right after 4, and right when Reed took over, but wow he really goofed up a ton of projects. How he kept getting greenlit is beyond me.
Actually wouldn't mind that story getting retconned a bit.
    “Somehow, the Rookie returned”
I mean it’s a book, right? So couldn’t they ever con it, or at least change some of it so that buck still becomes a spartan (I haven’t played 5 that’s all I know) but
343's storytelling is horrible, they're making the distiny mistake of rushing to show everything instead of leaving some mystery to players' imagination, as well as making strange story decisions that just seem like generic story beats incorporating any named character they can find and subsequently kind of ruining them...

that being said, there's still nothing getting close to touching the kilo 5 trilogy
Died like a rookie too lol
>And got rookie killed. I feel 343 management likes to waste story telling and game potential on purpose.

 Just because it made you mad doesn't mean the writing was bad or whatever. The entire cast of ODST is honestly a bunch of undisciplined shit heels so everything going badly wasn't all that surprising at all.
    [removed]
        lol honey your acct is gonna get suspended
            Good

Also, there's only one c in act go back to primary
rookie's death was before mickey's defection
    Yes but it was his hesitation to shoot an Innie that allowed said Innie to shoot Rookie in the head.

Like that is actual guilt Mickey was carrying about that.
        shit you're right, sorry lol
Rookie wasn’t a character. 

He had less character than the odst that walks up to you at the start of delta halo

Less than any of the marines featured in any of the games
Would've loved that as a Halo 5 spin off dlc campaign.
Romeo just really does not want to be out there, last I checked he'd rather be either Sniping numb-nuts at range or seducing ladies. Urban Combat sucks major balls.

And I don't blame him since *he's the guy who got Shwacked with the back of a gravity hammer* and suffered internal bleeding in his lungs because of it. The man obviously likes having 200+ meters between him and whatever he's been sent to kill.
Yeah, you passed 🫡
I assume you feel the same about Noble 6? And any other character that you play as yourself?
    Yes? Although even Noble 6 gets some voice lines to personalize them a bit, Rookie has zilch.
        I mean, when the character is supposed to be you, it's easier to have the character not speak as opposed to doing a Mass Effect style dialog option. Halo has never needed that.
            Yes. That doesn't really have anything to do with the fact that I don't care about him because he's not a character.
                Sure. But he is a character. The protagonist is quite literally the main character. Your option is you don't like him, the fact is he is a character.
                    Not really.
Master Chief’s whole ass origin story is in a book, and it came out before CE. If you can’t be bothered to read that’s nobody’s problem but yours
    And yet it's completely and totally irrelevant to the Bungie games.
        •_•
They did that in Reach, doing it again with a less important ODST would just be lame
I mean, that too. Not like it’s a competition
O O F
