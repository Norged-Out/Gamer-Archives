[[Don't go in electrical alone boys]]





The little shrug he does makes me think orange is imagining it but just shrugs it off cause he cleared white already...right?
    I feel like this is one of those things that can be interpreted many ways, but I like your interpretation a lot.
    It felt like a *hairs on the back of your neck* moment that they shook off to me
    It's more like, "Did I hear a...? Nah it's probably nothing"
        Must have been the wind.
            Indeed, I believe so.
        Y'all out here being all speculative I just thought it was him reacting to the crisis. He's like "Oh damn the reactor! Oh, nevermind, someone got it already"
            That makes more sense
    White? I saw Yellow...
        Dude no, I was in nav ask cyan
            I was with cyan, didn’t see you there
                Guess we know who we're voting off now bois.
        Nah it was PANDA
    oh i looove this interpretation!
This is amazing! Did you animate this?
    yep! on my ipad heh, thank you btw :D
        Being on an iPad makes it even more impressive! It looks like professional work
            well, the iPad and Pencil are pretty much professional level tools for art these days
                I still live back in time :(
                I use phone, Autodesk Sketchbook and a mixture of stylus and fingers. I didn't know that those could be so professional when used correctly i thought you needed the expensive drawing tablets with the plug in stylus as well as a good drawing app
                    ipads are basically just mobile cintiqs.
                    Well the iPad Pro and pencil aren’t cheap. The Adobe suit has been updated a lot to work pretty well on iPad and Procreate has been quite good for a while.  If you already have a computer, you can get one of the cheaper Wacom tablets but the learning curve is steeper than ipad.
                    Try Adobe sketch, it's free and is great for drawing and stuff, not sure about animating though.
                        Ok I'll give it a try thank you for recommending it to me
                            No problem. I used it for alot of drawings a few years ago when I was in school. Each student had an ipad to use at school and it worked really good on iPad. I know it's on android too, but I've never tried it on android.
                                https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adobe.creativeapps.sketch is this it?
                                    Yes
                                Wow that sounds amazing I wish my school even allowed us to do digital art. We are stuck doing traditional art but I've been studying art since primary 7 so it's just revising stuff I know because in terms of what I know about art I'm ahead of my year. I just want to draw my original species but no I need to draw a lemon
                    Wow i use sketchbook alot i didnt realise you could animate in it though?
                        What I do is draw every frame then put it into an animation app like flipaclip
                            Ooooh. Ok... thought that I was maybe missing something there. But infact you are a very talented masochist lol
                                Thank you! The way I do it is I draw the key frames in sketchbook then do the movement ones in flipaclip
                    ibisPaint and Medibang are some really good free mobile apps, depending on what you’re looking for. I haven’t used Medibang in years, but it does a LOT. The drawback is that it’s a little cluttered imo. I like ibis because I can still do a lot, but I can also hide most of the UI so I can draw using the full screen
                You reckon it’s okay to start with an iPad and a pen if one was to get into drawing?
                    Absolutely. Another $10 gets you Procreate which continually releases new features and is at this point one of the best digital illustration applications on any platform. Or, of course, there’s the Adobe suite which they’ve been porting over.

Disclaimer: I’m not actually an artist myself, so if i’m exaggerating the capabilities of these things someone feel free to correct me. This is just what I’ve observed / heard from others. I do have procreate myself though and it’s a ton of fun.
                This better be the real early.

            thanks ! It took about a week because my hand kept hurting oof
                Carpal tunnel syndrome is a small price to pay for such a masterpiece.
                    A small price to pay for salvation.
                Awesome stuff, reminds me of The Thing
                hey just curious.  really want to get into this style of art.  quick looping gifs.  am a fan of sachin teng's work and stuff.  how many frames did you animate here?
                    there's 44 drawn frames but some of them are on "hold" (it's like longer exposure i think?) so if you want to include all the held frames, it would be 200+
                        gotcha, thanks!
        This is FANTASTIC!! What app did you use??
            OP used procreate
        What app did you use?
            Probably Procreate
                bingo!
            what app!!!!!!
        Well someone earned a follow
        Did you draw with a stylus or with your hands? I draw with my hands.
    [removed]
        They really do but they also get better every day as well
gif compression kinda messed some things up, so here's the [video version on my twitter](https://twitter.com/tecochet/status/1310621390060490752?s=20)! :")
    The compression intensifies the feel of the GIF. Excellent work!
        OH i never thought it that way! thank you :D
            [deleted]
                I cannot back up this comment enough! That's part of the appeal of subs like r/curseimages. The grainier the photo, the scarier.
                OH thank you for this! If I ever end up doing more, I'll definitely try to lean more into the spooky grainy effect !
    The GIF compression gives it some kind of classic-horror style. Suits it pretty well!
I got CARRION vibes and The Thing vibes
    It’s from the thing prequel
        Juliette to be exact
    Among Us is basically The Thing, you especially get that feel when you play in Polus
        I feel like Among Us and Deceit both added their cold/Arctic maps as a reference to The Thing. But then again, maybe they just added them cause the Arctic is cool
        Among Us is The Thing, but no matter how much you try to be MacReady, everyone wants to be Blair and go batshit crazy because of the knowledge that there *is* an imposter, not because they know who it is.
        My name is THE THING in the game, I thought people would make the connection real fast, but they don't. I guess most people haven't seen it?
    I was musing about how there should be some kind of crossover between the two games, or at least the narrative. Among Us can be a prequel to Carrion.
        Both are inspired by The Thing.
            Very much so!
    It’s pretty much the cover art of Carrion lol, that doesn’t take away from how dope this animation is though.
    More like Parasyte Maxim
Me not going alone at electrical 

But my teamate was the imposter and killed me
    Every fucking time I swear.
    I usually walk in there with two other people
        The two imposters:
            Well, the chance is still lower
    Nothing like the reactor having a meltdown when you and your best bro are alone together in a dark corner next to a vent.
    Or waiting for a companion only to be labeled sus and kicked.
        “ThEY weRe foLloWiNG mE! ItS orAnGe!”

Bruh, we were both trying to fix the wires... don’t even try to blame me when we all know green was offed wayyy over in weapons!
    "ah thank god there's two people here. Guess I'll do my tasks right quick. What are the odds they're both imposters?" 

Narrator: They both were imposters.
That's narly dude. Pretty awesome art.
    thank you :)
Holy shit I love it, gives me huge The Thing vibes
    It’s from the thing prequel
This looks great, what program did you use to animate it on?
    i used Procreate on ipad pro, was a bit of a doozy bc it only allowed me up to 53 layers
        thank you
        how did you do it then?
            i had to animate the crewmate and the impostor on different files, and then combine it later after it's all coloured and done... not the most efficient way to do it oof
            Well the gif only has 53 unique frames max then. Its about three seconds long so if its at 24 fps, with some filler still frames in there then viola you have a gif.
This is incredible. As someone who knows absolutely nothing about animation, well done.
    thanks!! this community has come up with suuuch amazing animations, i had to give it a try too :D
I do not fear electrical
    i do :(
    You should. Personally, I usually ask for people I know are safe to follow me into electrical
That’s so awesome!!!
I love it :DDD

I love the detail! And it has a nice mood to it
white lookin kinda god tier tho
then he self reports and says red vented
Yo this is amazing! Great job!
omg best one yet
the animation is NUTS on this. even the little shrug at the end is masterfully crafted
What happens in Electrical, stays in Electrical
That's really cool but I actually had a cool among us gif idea (Just an idea). What if it was like this but the lights go out and you can see a tongue come out of the darkness (or what ever you want to do, like a knife, gun, hand ect) and when the lights come back on it disappears. Just a cool thought nothing serious
Getting some really strong The Thing vibes. This is amazing looking dude! Bravo 👏🏻
Why didn't I use my free award on this piece of art ;-;
The fan art for this game is amazing
I love fan art of the imposter as an Eldritch being
    Happy cakeday!

^(Beep boop I'm a bot. Check this bot's page for developer contact if you have a question. Upvote if you like this, downvote if you do not.)
Idk reds kinda sus
THIS is why i always call a meeting to have someone follow me to electric
    Emergency calls are pretty annoying though, people will probably vote you out because you are interrupting their business
        Yeah, people get annoyed even when the meeting was called with a good reason. Saw someone vent, so I called a meeting and ended up getting voted by 3 players because it was annoying
    I just always sprint into electrical while the game is starting at the shhhh screen. You end up in there finishing tasks before their intial kill cooldown is over.
        Huge brain
Woah
Amazing work!
Hey, did you post this on Tumblr? I just saw this video on Tumblr, and if it's not you then I think someone stole your work

What the fuuuuuck
this is so cool (sorry for ruining the 69 comments)
I played Among Us for the first time a couple hours ago. I went to electrical alone. 

Less than 2 minutes into it and I was already dead... :(
[Looks familiar...](https://imgur.com/gallery/eJKu39M)
I know this has already been said but you did really good
Thats so fucking cool. It's just a game where you play as some blob but talented people like you come up with such amazing things!
OP, what brushes did you use in Procreate and what size is the artboard?
    I used the Syrup (under inking) brush for lineart and 3780 x 2480 pixels canvas
Why we always gotta do our killin' in electrical?
This made the impostor seem like real evil, i don't know why but no other animation has done that to me. To me the impostor has always been like a bit comical almost but never evil.
How did you create the focusing effect?
    nice catch! yes i blurred the background and then inverse the blur to focus on the imposter during the light change :)
Well fucking done! Those suits really match the in-game ones. Don't get me wrong, Space suits are cool, but in my opinion, they always looked like Hazmat suits. But these are a great blend of both!
I hate electrical...
esta increible ,super bueno me encanto
This is so damn good, are you a professional? I need a micro web series or something of this.
    HAH i wish! Making animations as a career sounds nice :")
That’s scary as hell!! But so cool as well
The best Among Us art/animation I’ve seen so far! Incredible. Love your designs for the crewmate and impostor.
r/vredditdownloader
Each passing day, electrical gives me ever increasing anxiety. 

Great job on the gif though, looks very nice!
Reminds me of carrion
Very high quality animation
This is so awsome im in awe
i could never get close to even drawing one of these frames! gg dude
Yo how can I download this
reminds me of Akira. Really nice work. I hope your skills lead you to success if they have not already.
I love the line quality holy shit. And the depth of field? Incredible. You're incredibly skilled, that must have taken so much work and practice to get to this point.
the blinking lights are the cherry on top the ominous energy and tension is PERFECT

That is so cool!
Damn ur good at making art
D... Does his tongue have teeth?
    yes i'm not sure why i did that, but i was at frame 16 when i realized maybe it was a mistake... might as well commit  :"D
That bit at the end tho serious chills
Same with reactor
It reminds me of the carrion trailer
Hey I saw this on Twitter and I wanted to say nice work!
Kinda reminds me of that one episode from Futurama where there’s a mimic alien that swallows each crewmate.
This is fucking amazing
That looks so cool! You did amazing
    so... ...where’d you get killed
Low-key scared to play among us again
That’s talent right there
Oh man we’re heading towards the point of people animating these at this level now? Wonder how long until we see a 2 min long at this quality!! God I love this so much
So I do eletrical with sombody 

Im like ok im safe

They are just the imposter waiting to kill me
I always do my electrical tasks first to avoid going there later on
I don’t know why but the animation reminds me of like anime type. Mostly like Tokyo ghoul
That’s such a smooth animation!!
Dude this is amazing it looks like a Among Us movie
I do, I always do and almost never die. Just speedrun to electrical
Man this is one hell of an animation! Did you use procreate for this?
u/vredditdownloader
Whenever I'm imposter on a server with low kill refresh (or anytime really), I love to turn out the lights, wait in the hallway, and kill someone. Then wait for the next person and kill them too.  I've had bodies piled 3 and 4 high a few times now.  One game I got imposter 4 times in a row and did this the first three games.  Lost game 3 at final 3 because the last two entered together.  Game 4 I played slower and hung out with people, letting my teammate do the killing. Gotta love electrical :D
This is really cool! Keep up the good work!
You should post this to r/imsorryeveryone
This is why I go to electrical right off the bat
Among us anime maybe?
Jaek Tegal?
This is good
~~I do enjoy how the game never explicitly explains what the imposter is. (To my knowledge)~~

~~Based on kill animations, they might be a spy, someone committing espionage, a "The Thing" type monster, or whatever.~~

~~Just fun that you're just an "imposter" among the crew and you can roleplay in your head whatever that means.~~

Edit: ignore all of this I don't know how to Google
Yoooo this is badass omg!!!!!
Oooh fuck! This is the best unexpected so far
This is badass, reminds me of the Reverse-Horror Carrion with the mind control and Among Us at the same time, keep up the good work!!
That is some next level animation bro. amazing work!
Frickin how
Has a Heavy Metal vibe to it, I dig it
I love all this fan art
Woah I didn’t know Juliette from The Thing was in Among us! /s
    Still my favorite 2 monster movies.
This is equivalent to 

"Don't mine at night."

Edit: Typos
This basically looks like a transformation from the thing.
Wow, this is incredible work!
Wow this is really fucking cool
feel like its carrion on that last part.

&#x200B;

neat job
I think of Unfortunate Spaceman honestly
this is insane! I love the artstyle and atmosphere!

really well animated :D
I've never actually played *Among Us*; I'm only familiar with it via memes. Is it canon that the "Imposters" are actually horrifying alien monsters in disguise? Or is that just a fan thing?
Holy shit
u/vredditdownloader
Reminds me of last game I played. White killed someone in front of orange and then pinned it on him, orange was voted out. I started an emergency meeting to call white out and then they voted me out. Then when there were three people left one guy who was left sided with white and then we lost... I feel like I’m constantly playing with 8 year olds
I almost crapped myself when the mouth opened
Once I went in electrical, all scared. But then I see purple and let out a sigh thinking i was safe. I stood behind purpple fixing the wires

That bitch was waiting out his cooldown and snapped my body in half as soon as I was done. 

Electrical is not safe, even with all 10 of us in there!
It makes me think about Carrion
This is really great!!!
*Sluuuuurrrp*
reminds me of carrion
How long did it take to do this :^)
reminds me of parasyte
So Among Us is the Parasyte the Maxim game we never got
u/vredditdownloader
I haven't played this game, but I'm looking forward to the film.
Holy crap, I'm in love.
why is every kill in electrical tho lol
u/vredditdownloader
That gave me some Carrion vibes ngl
What is this game even about? Something about imposters? Someone please explain.
You get a follow since I don’t have an award
I always go in electricity alone, rarely killed there
Amazing
Someone needs to make a horror movie
WTF why is this community so talented?!
I'm not alone though! I have my good friend white to accompany me!
That seamless loop is what gets me. Absolutely amazing!
Let me guess.. so there is 3 different types of Impostor one is a murderer with a knife, 2nd is like a secret assassin, and 3rd the monster
Electric is big time death room
This game’s design is cute and simple, but the concept of the story has potential to be turned into one of those horror movies that even as an adult, terrify you to such an extent that whenever your alone, you don’t feel like you’re alone
Orange sus.
Amazing
Seems to always be electrical. Sometimes when I'm calibrating. lol
They should new roles into the game.
He wasn't alone he was with white
my mom says its my turn to repost this in a month
I haven't even got a funny quip; that's just really cool
Admin is just as bad. -.- once everyone was in admin doing a task and red came up last and started killing everyone. I was faking doing the task but before I could run I was killed too. :'3
The thing is one of my favorite movies. This animation is a great example of why I love this game so much
ORANGE LOOK OUT OH GOD HE CANT HEAR US
I saw one of these but I was about This dude and his kid and every since I’ve never killed them if they had a kid
I haven't played this game. I see a lot of memes about electrical specifically as opposed to any of the other rooms. Why is that?
Or the file download, if i had a dollar everytime.. or those minute long tasks that get reset with a meeting at 8 seconds..
this is godly what-
I went into electrical at the start of the matcha and I should’ve known that that is a hotspot for imposters because sure enough the imposter followed me there and killed me
Thanks I just died there.
Beautiful. Glorious. 127/10. IF this clip had a paywall, 'd pay to watch it ngl.
Orange is sus
Holy fuck this is good

This looks more like Carrion
What program did you use?
I'm getting some major The Thing vibes

Animation is spectacular btw really pleasing to my eyes (I did animation as part of my college course and developed an "eye" - meaning any animation that looks even slightly wrong, I can see it so to speak)
I thought they only had one bone how does this work
That is the best among us animation I have ever seen people like you deserve scholarships
I love how orange is trying to connect the red wire with the blue (or green) wire
It is best to bring 3 people in there at the same time

It's imposter Mezoth
Holy hell o-o

I love the body horror among us art I keep seeing!
Reminds me of [that one episode](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_on_the_Planet_Express) of Futurama
Gives me “THE THING” vibes.
He gunn eat em
Devil man cry baby likes this
This makes me think of Unfortunate Spacemen (also available on steam) more than Among Us, nice job on this tho
Orange is taking too long doing wiring, he's sus
Bruh this looks like some shit straight out of r/imsorryjon
White lookin kinda sus at the end there ngl
Wow! That’s incredible! :0
Uh oh he has a ghoul
Holy crap
Mandatory I've seen enough hentai to know where this is going
Wow! This is beautiful!
Among us more like a horror game
Nice
I guess the girls can go to electrical alone.
Delicious
This is creepier then what the inside of Fall Guys look like. Check the Fall Guys Twitter, they posted official lure
This is amazing! It’s also the thing reference correct?
yo this shit is amazing man! props on your talent :))
Reminds me of The Thing!  Excellent job.
Mmm, tasty
So much awards and no real ones
We’re slowly getting into Unfortunate Spacemen territory
That imposter is low key high key terrifying
thats super good, is it supposed to be orange's imagination as he seems to shrug it off?
I'm new to the game, but one thing I've used a couple time was to stand in electrical by the front box where you fix the lights, (as long as I wasn't seen going in) and just wait for some to walk in alone, then shut the doors on them. Kill, then vent out to medical or something. Any veterans out there want to tell me the flaws in that plan? Things I think of are that I can't see the whole med bay when venting, and can't be sure nobody saw me go into electrical. Also, the body isn't hidden very well. Still learning the ropes as an impostor lol. And it gets my heart racing every time I am.

Great artwork by the way. Sorry for going odd topic here lol.
Would love to see the penetrate scene
It wasn't me bro, pink saw, right pink?

Pink: Cyan sus
(Me when my sister takes my yogurt)
INCREDIBLE
That's really good art
I would watch this movie intently.
Anyone watch the anime Parasyte
It loops so perfectly. Good job
Oh! The perfect loop, 10/10.
. I'm,, I'm no we
one of my friend always camps in storage. as soon as he sees someone enter electrical, he goes behind them and kills them.
We need more of this content
I really like the animation
That’s fucking sick
Major CARRION vibes, also holy shit this is amazing
Orange seems kinda sus
Love the spacesuit design here
This is some The Thing shit right here
This is amazing!!! The animation is gorgeous and I love the style.
Orange sus that’s all I’m sayin

Alright i vote for an among us anime. This looks amazing. Please make a short pilot if you could, and I would also be happy to voice act in it (i have a RODE NT1 which delivers very good quality) i also know a couple producers i could get to produce original music for it. This needs to happen
***Dead body reported***

Blue: Where

White: Where

Green: Who

Yellow: Where

Red: White vented. I found orange in electrical and he entered the vent as I came in.

Blue: White, defense?

White: Red sus. He's accusing me for no reason.

Blue: that's true, vote red guys, if it's not him we vote white.

Red: White fucking vented you dumbasses.

Blue: sounds like something the imposter would say.

***Red was not the imposter***

*2 Imposters remaining*

#*Defeat (White, Green.)*

I always feel bad when I am the imposter and someone is in electrical alone
Well done.
That's Awesome, Besides the Part Where Orange Y'know.
Reminds me of the thing
It took me a moment to realise that’s White not Red
And then they jump in a vent, go to med, and turn the lights off so no one suspects them

The good news: I always go in electrical with a crewmate

The bad news: it's pink
This reminds me of Parasite!
Its always electrical

"Good thing white is watching me, purple told me he saw white scan."
Oml I just got out of a game where I baited somebody into killing me in electrical. Don't be there alone folks, it's dangerous.
My god, the characters are perfect.
This is awesome! I love this!!!
I love how perfectly this loops. Looks fantastic! I definitely love the horror take on Among Us
These drawings are just nightmare fuel
I'll be sleeping well tonight! \*nervous laughter\*
I wanna see a thing version of among us like an animation or something
These animations are getting more and more disturbing.
Okay...I never going there now.
OP, what program did you use? photoshop sucks for animating with multiple subjects
Good bye boys.    I’m heading to electrical. 😰😢😭
great edits with sound advice
Honestly, this isn’t that good. I don’t have any experience animating or drawing but I could do this easily😂
Is this game based on the thing?
this is dope! you should cross-post this to /r/ImSorryJon
Among Us community is the best. Change my mind! ❤️
damn
Am i the only one that almost never dies at electrical? No? Just me? Aight.
I love how these tongue impostor animations and fan arts always have a The Thing vibes. I love it.
You’re insanely skilled!! I love this so so much! Your other animation of Azula is amazing as well, I love the flickering effects c:
"You see, what we're talkin' about here is an organism that imitates other life-forms, *and it imitates* '*em perfectly"*
holy shit thats gnarly
Do y’all guys ever laugh at the fact that these characters are indeed three foot tall. Like I could punt the imposter
I still have nightmares from this.
U know its over when its just the two of you left
Incredible!! This is so neat!!!1
Orange seems kinda sus, white said he saw him vent
F
FACTS!!! Lol that corner is some spooky shit
u/vredditdownloader
Goddamn that's cool!
Amazing good job
Yea well, I got four tasks there four times in a row four times in seperate lobbies.
By far the most common place to be killed
Sick work.
Carrion X Among us
what did you use for animating this?
So....when is Among Us gonna hire you?
Me: Can someone go into electrical w me, I’m scared

Imp: 😏
u/VredditDownloader
*FNAF power outage them intensifies*
Is their sound, if so I have no idea how to turn it on, I just got reddit.
Love how among us is just "the thing" the game.
wow this is really good
Holy shit that’s wicked
Yeahhhhh I'm ready for a live action movie, c'mon with it already
This is an amazing animation
I know this wont be seen but can you guys help me find my friend adrelix i cant post because of my karma thank you.

This is the best Among Us fan content yet.

This is so fucking creepy....
That's Awesome and electrical is such a demon

Shite, that’s what Among us would look like if it mad by triple A game company. Look sick
Reminds me of Carrion

this gives me The Thing flashbacks
Electrical: **The place where bad juju starts to happen**
u/vredditdownloader
Makes me wish we had more "The Thing" type of kills.
Okay, but this is actually terrifying as fuck
This is like Among Us but it's an anime
This reminds me of The Thing. Well done.
This shit scared me
This is some anime level stuff
S...sweats in monsterfucker.

This is what we’ve all been waiting for
I really like the suit designs
Yellow sus
This reminds me of the thing
Its always f*cking electrical. I finally formed up a simp squad...of like 4 people....we never died.... -3- and we just slowly moved from one room to the next doing tasks
I'm getting mad Carrion vibes from this
I don't think going to electrical with less than 5 people is safe
u/vredditdownloader
And I never went in electrical again...
***To Be Continued***

*Roundabout begins playing*
I love the design of the crewmate
Holy fucking shut that’s insane
Ouuu nicee work!!
I mean... He's not alone.
I go to electric to die
Ok, this is awesome. I’ve been trying to play this game and it’s kinda garbage, but the creativity it has spawned in the meme culture is amazing. No idea why this is the game of all games that spawned all this content, but it’s amazing.
*im pennywise, would you like to play a game?*
Perfect content for /r/imsorryjon
This gives me evangelion vibes
That’s looks soo good you are very talented
This reminds me of a futurama season 10 episode 11. It is just like this.

Goddamn electrical

proceeds to report
But I was in freaking medbay!
This is awesome, I love the little shrug
wtf this is so cool but the little, adorable beans being depicted this way creeps me out
"He just wants to play!"
This animation is probably the coolest and creative works I’ve ever seen. Well done! Definitely reminds me of the thing prequel like others have said.
I feel like this is one of those things that can be interpreted many ways, but I like your interpretation a lot.
It felt like a *hairs on the back of your neck* moment that they shook off to me
It's more like, "Did I hear a...? Nah it's probably nothing"
    Must have been the wind.
        Indeed, I believe so.
    Y'all out here being all speculative I just thought it was him reacting to the crisis. He's like "Oh damn the reactor! Oh, nevermind, someone got it already"
        That makes more sense
White? I saw Yellow...
    Dude no, I was in nav ask cyan
        I was with cyan, didn’t see you there
            Guess we know who we're voting off now bois.
    Nah it was PANDA
oh i looove this interpretation!
yep! on my ipad heh, thank you btw :D
    Being on an iPad makes it even more impressive! It looks like professional work
        well, the iPad and Pencil are pretty much professional level tools for art these days
            I still live back in time :(
            I use phone, Autodesk Sketchbook and a mixture of stylus and fingers. I didn't know that those could be so professional when used correctly i thought you needed the expensive drawing tablets with the plug in stylus as well as a good drawing app
                ipads are basically just mobile cintiqs.
                Well the iPad Pro and pencil aren’t cheap. The Adobe suit has been updated a lot to work pretty well on iPad and Procreate has been quite good for a while.  If you already have a computer, you can get one of the cheaper Wacom tablets but the learning curve is steeper than ipad.
                Try Adobe sketch, it's free and is great for drawing and stuff, not sure about animating though.
                    Ok I'll give it a try thank you for recommending it to me
                        No problem. I used it for alot of drawings a few years ago when I was in school. Each student had an ipad to use at school and it worked really good on iPad. I know it's on android too, but I've never tried it on android.
                            https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adobe.creativeapps.sketch is this it?
                                Yes
                            Wow that sounds amazing I wish my school even allowed us to do digital art. We are stuck doing traditional art but I've been studying art since primary 7 so it's just revising stuff I know because in terms of what I know about art I'm ahead of my year. I just want to draw my original species but no I need to draw a lemon
                Wow i use sketchbook alot i didnt realise you could animate in it though?
                    What I do is draw every frame then put it into an animation app like flipaclip
                        Ooooh. Ok... thought that I was maybe missing something there. But infact you are a very talented masochist lol
                            Thank you! The way I do it is I draw the key frames in sketchbook then do the movement ones in flipaclip
                ibisPaint and Medibang are some really good free mobile apps, depending on what you’re looking for. I haven’t used Medibang in years, but it does a LOT. The drawback is that it’s a little cluttered imo. I like ibis because I can still do a lot, but I can also hide most of the UI so I can draw using the full screen
            You reckon it’s okay to start with an iPad and a pen if one was to get into drawing?
                Absolutely. Another $10 gets you Procreate which continually releases new features and is at this point one of the best digital illustration applications on any platform. Or, of course, there’s the Adobe suite which they’ve been porting over.

Disclaimer: I’m not actually an artist myself, so if i’m exaggerating the capabilities of these things someone feel free to correct me. This is just what I’ve observed / heard from others. I do have procreate myself though and it’s a ton of fun.
            This better be the real early.

        thanks ! It took about a week because my hand kept hurting oof
            Carpal tunnel syndrome is a small price to pay for such a masterpiece.
                A small price to pay for salvation.
            Awesome stuff, reminds me of The Thing
            hey just curious.  really want to get into this style of art.  quick looping gifs.  am a fan of sachin teng's work and stuff.  how many frames did you animate here?
                there's 44 drawn frames but some of them are on "hold" (it's like longer exposure i think?) so if you want to include all the held frames, it would be 200+
                    gotcha, thanks!
    This is FANTASTIC!! What app did you use??
        OP used procreate
    What app did you use?
        Probably Procreate
            bingo!
        what app!!!!!!
    Well someone earned a follow
    Did you draw with a stylus or with your hands? I draw with my hands.
[removed]
    They really do but they also get better every day as well
The compression intensifies the feel of the GIF. Excellent work!
    OH i never thought it that way! thank you :D
        [deleted]
            I cannot back up this comment enough! That's part of the appeal of subs like r/curseimages. The grainier the photo, the scarier.
            OH thank you for this! If I ever end up doing more, I'll definitely try to lean more into the spooky grainy effect !
The GIF compression gives it some kind of classic-horror style. Suits it pretty well!
It’s from the thing prequel
    Juliette to be exact
Among Us is basically The Thing, you especially get that feel when you play in Polus
    I feel like Among Us and Deceit both added their cold/Arctic maps as a reference to The Thing. But then again, maybe they just added them cause the Arctic is cool
    Among Us is The Thing, but no matter how much you try to be MacReady, everyone wants to be Blair and go batshit crazy because of the knowledge that there *is* an imposter, not because they know who it is.
    My name is THE THING in the game, I thought people would make the connection real fast, but they don't. I guess most people haven't seen it?
I was musing about how there should be some kind of crossover between the two games, or at least the narrative. Among Us can be a prequel to Carrion.
    Both are inspired by The Thing.
        Very much so!
It’s pretty much the cover art of Carrion lol, that doesn’t take away from how dope this animation is though.
More like Parasyte Maxim
Every fucking time I swear.
I usually walk in there with two other people
    The two imposters:
        Well, the chance is still lower
Nothing like the reactor having a meltdown when you and your best bro are alone together in a dark corner next to a vent.
Or waiting for a companion only to be labeled sus and kicked.
    “ThEY weRe foLloWiNG mE! ItS orAnGe!”

Bruh, we were both trying to fix the wires... don’t even try to blame me when we all know green was offed wayyy over in weapons!
"ah thank god there's two people here. Guess I'll do my tasks right quick. What are the odds they're both imposters?" 

Narrator: They both were imposters.
thank you :)
It’s from the thing prequel
i used Procreate on ipad pro, was a bit of a doozy bc it only allowed me up to 53 layers
    thank you
    how did you do it then?
        i had to animate the crewmate and the impostor on different files, and then combine it later after it's all coloured and done... not the most efficient way to do it oof
        Well the gif only has 53 unique frames max then. Its about three seconds long so if its at 24 fps, with some filler still frames in there then viola you have a gif.
thanks!! this community has come up with suuuch amazing animations, i had to give it a try too :D
i do :(
You should. Personally, I usually ask for people I know are safe to follow me into electrical
Happy cakeday!

Emergency calls are pretty annoying though, people will probably vote you out because you are interrupting their business
    Yeah, people get annoyed even when the meeting was called with a good reason. Saw someone vent, so I called a meeting and ended up getting voted by 3 players because it was annoying
I just always sprint into electrical while the game is starting at the shhhh screen. You end up in there finishing tasks before their intial kill cooldown is over.
    Huge brain
i did post it on tumblr! if it's from tecochet, then it's definitely me :")
Alright, I got this

I used the Syrup (under inking) brush for lineart and 3780 x 2480 pixels canvas
nice catch! yes i blurred the background and then inverse the blur to focus on the imposter during the light change :)
HAH i wish! Making animations as a career sounds nice :")
Rip
yes i'm not sure why i did that, but i was at frame 16 when i realized maybe it was a mistake... might as well commit  :"D
so... ...where’d you get killed
Still my favorite 2 monster movies.

We are stuck doing traditional art but I've been studying art since primary 7 so it's just revising stuff I know because in terms of what I know about art I'm ahead of my year. I just want to draw my original species but no I need to draw a lemon
    Wow i use sketchbook alot i didnt realise you could animate in it though?
        What I do is draw every frame then put it into an animation app like flipaclip
            Ooooh. Ok... thought that I was maybe missing something there. But infact you are a very talented masochist lol
                Thank you! The way I do it is I draw the key frames in sketchbook then do the movement ones in flipaclip
    ibisPaint and Medibang are some really good free mobile apps, depending on what you’re looking for. I haven’t used Medibang in years, but it does a LOT. The drawback is that it’s a little cluttered imo. I like ibis because I can still do a lot, but I can also hide most of the UI so I can draw using the full screen
You reckon it’s okay to start with an iPad and a pen if one was to get into drawing?
    Absolutely. Another $10 gets you Procreate which continually releases new features and is at this point one of the best digital illustration applications on any platform. Or, of course, there’s the Adobe suite which they’ve been porting over.

Disclaimer: I’m not actually an artist myself, so if i’m exaggerating the capabilities of these things someone feel free to correct me. This is just what I’ve observed / heard from others. I do have procreate myself though and it’s a ton of fun.
This better be the real early.
Carpal tunnel syndrome is a small price to pay for such a masterpiece.
    A small price to pay for salvation.
Awesome stuff, reminds me of The Thing
hey just curious.  really want to get into this style of art.  quick looping gifs.  am a fan of sachin teng's work and stuff.  how many frames did you animate here?
    there's 44 drawn frames but some of them are on "hold" (it's like longer exposure i think?) so if you want to include all the held frames, it would be 200+
        gotcha, thanks!
bingo!
I cannot back up this comment enough! That's part of the appeal of subs like r/curseimages. The grainier the photo, the scarier.
OH thank you for this! If I ever end up doing more, I'll definitely try to lean more into the spooky grainy effect !
ipads are basically just mobile cintiqs.
Well the iPad Pro and pencil aren’t cheap. The Adobe suit has been updated a lot to work pretty well on iPad and Procreate has been quite good for a while.  If you already have a computer, you can get one of the cheaper Wacom tablets but the learning curve is steeper than ipad.
Try Adobe sketch, it's free and is great for drawing and stuff, not sure about animating though.
    Ok I'll give it a try thank you for recommending it to me
        No problem. I used it for alot of drawings a few years ago when I was in school. Each student had an ipad to use at school and it worked really good on iPad. I know it's on android too, but I've never tried it on android.
