[[What is do you think is the main reason you lose imposter games.]]


I think not being around crewmates to build trust is my weakness. I don’t like to hang around groups as an imp or even a crewmate.


Often bad luck or I’m being too aggressive, usually both
    Same, I hate playing the long games. I’ve done it in the past and have won but it’s honestly just annoying and stressful.
My impostor partner gets spotted 1 minute into the game, the lobby has low number of tasks so I can't clutch  
or  
I focus on marination and don't kill fast enough. I like being partnered with players who I know will go on a killing spree because somehow i start killing like up to 3 times faster with them? I don't get how that works but I'll take it xD
I actually carried a few imposter rounds myself, in one game 1 of my partner left and other one was voted out with 5 remaining, i had to kill 3 in a row without others noticing. 

A few times i was stupid and got caught red handed. 

2 times i was ratted out.

My game was hacked and the hacker killed me. 

But now I am suffering drought, i haven't had an imposter game for over 50 games 😮‍💨
    I commend you for staying in that solo game. I’ve done it aswell but I’m left just feeling stressed out after the whole thing. You have to talk a lot to not get caught in solo.
Same i hate grouping up as a crewmate because the game just becomes way too easy
I think I'm a good imp mechanically, as in I know how to kill without witnesses, but I am really trash at the chat portion of the ruse. I am a hardcore introvert, and really clam up in social situations (including Among Us). Nothing looks more sus than being quiet in those final rounds.
I’m a sloppy killer. I don’t strategize my kills at all. Just kind of wait for that decisive moment to strike and I go for it! And then somebody walks up behind me. 😤
I don’t have it on me to lie
Forgot the question mark 😭
    1: Having a shit partner who’s the SS, gets caught, and they sabotage everything leaving me to suffer.

2: Going solo cause your partner leaves, or isn’t the SS, but what’s the point in being the SS if you’re going to shift in the most obvious places.

3: Your partner getting caught venting and is silent when asked the vent CD, or says they’re in the areas that imps always say they are (Upper, reactor, comms, or nav) and gets caught when players are there.

4: Or them just killing in front of everyone claiming it was SS, when they clearly did it, then they lie about where they were, thus (Very rarely.), they rat you out.

5: The casual noob you get partnered up with who fakes a visual or common task, or says they’re doing scan or trash when there’s 0 long tasks. Though I’ve had some high levels give themselves up like that too, so it’s not every low level.

Usually what I do when I’m imp; I fake tasks, (If the task bar is meetings only.), and I usually kill in between faking tasks when there’s no one around, then once the next round is going, I fake download so the kill CD matches the download time, and then play it safe in between kills.

^ It works wonders, but gotta be mindful of engineers and who’s safe. Though, I don’t have long tasks, so having vent clean in a lobby is random.
Being impatient and making wrong moves at wrong time.
Cheaters, bad luck, losing arguments.
Because I'm stupid, mostly
not aggressive enough, I always think that I’m going to get caught so I don’t kill that many people
I personally when I am imposter I usually start to troll in chats like I killed 6 out of 7 where my partner killed only one and all but still I manage to win all the time lol
Because of kids teaming and trowing out the Impostors immediatly already / mostly knowing who is Impostor(s) at start.
Bad luck, I guess.
Mostly either bad luck or playing with wannabe psychics.
Depends on the lobby, but I don’t feel that having visual tasks make it a game anymore. Especially in lobbies with lots of tasks it just means everyone has a visual and it’s a race to show your visual vs being killed.
Usually it’s only if both me and my partner or not. 
But way too often my partner gets caught and then they just straight up tell them it’s me
I'm a little too passive. I may think theres someone else around thatll see me or smth and when i eventually fo decide to kill, there actually IS someone around or the tasks are almost done.

I'd say unfortunate voting but that happens more as crewmate, I somehow look more shifty when I'm innocent than not.
Because I’m horrible at it? Lol
Because rose always fks it up …..sigh
My bad luck of being the imposter is that my imposter teammate ratted me out or something I did would be stupid
i usually crack under pressure or too pressured to do anything 

orrrr i just wing it. either usually gets me caught, any other way is just bullshit lmao
Process of elimination and acting like an impostor too much.
i lose them a lot for “talking too much” apparently it’s suspicious how much i talk in meetings but i talk just as much when im a crewmate because i actually like when there are answers
Its only when i’m shapeshifting. They ask where i was at randomly and someone will go “well i was already there” and vote me out based off of 1/15ppls opinion.
Bad luck/timing mostly.
Metagaming and voice chat. 

Before you downvote me and say "Oh you just suck!", no. It's metagaming. 

I end up with games where someone says "Hey I'm on discord with that player and they said OP is imposter" all the time. And if I join organised games over discord? I either don't join the voice chat and get voted out on basis of not being in VC, someone "forgets" to leave when they are eliminated and "accidentally" says "OP is imposter", someone shouts my name as I eliminate them from the game, someone figures out that someone leaves the voice call the second I or another imposter follows them into the room, a spiteful imposter shouts at me for voting for them to "confirm" myself as imposter, some dingus "accidentally" says I am also imposter...
My main reason is that I go for risky kills
i barely talk + i'm never around other people
I'm bad at lying and afraid to be caught. So I just do nothing or give up and confess. Usually my impostor partner carries me
is ut just me or does litterally everyone leave when i am imposter?
Because I suck lol I blame it on the fact I don't play often and don't have the skill, but the truth is that I genuinely am very bad at being imp 😈
I kill too slow, and either forget or am unable to kill people who are cleared
I have absolutely zero social skills, and it shows during discussions.

So my only viable tactic is to speedrun as imp before I'm caught.
Usually my partners get caught early in the game
They always clear eachother
When I’m playing really good it’s coz of visual tasks almost all the crewmates have one and it’s near impossible to win at 4 or 3 players left.

But most the time it’s carelessness
Me getting accused of something I didn’t do or pure gut instinct
It’s honestly when I’m being too cautious, idk why but when I kill without giving a fuck I actually do good
