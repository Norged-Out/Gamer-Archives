[[When you're imposter and the dead body is kinda sus]]





Your post has been marked with the quality content flair
The kill cooldown flipping from 8 to infinity when the screen glitched/ flickered was a nice touch!
    Uuh nice, i noticed the infinity symbol, but not the transition
        same
I got an embarrassing amount of the way in before realizing this was a fan animation and not a glitch
    Ikr, I thought it was just netcode problems! Well done OP with the subtlety
    Ha imagine the lore of the imposter always seeing the crewmates body lurking around 

*always watching*
        I'd love for an option to have the imposter see ghosts. Let him be haunted by those he killed (or were wrongfully ejected).
            Fuck that, I just got some Doctor Who PTSD of the weeping angels from this. If I turned a corner and saw half a dude just standing there I'd probably poo a little.
                OH imagine how creepy it would be if they worked like the weeping angels and could only move when you can't see them!
                    Oh god, suddenly the lights going out become way stronger.
                        Hey, who turned out the lights? 💀
                            Hey, who turned out the lights?
                                Hey who turned out the--- *dead*

You're stronger than I am.
            I wish imps could see the ghost chat. I always wanna see what people say about me when I’m the imp.
            You know this might be a nice feature cause then that would add extra stress to the impostor
            Halloween event for this would be epic.
        Miiiiiiike Wazowski.
    Same lmao. I was like NOPE NOPE NOPE DONT LIKE THIS ONE BIT😳😳😳

😂
    I though Red was cheating
        Honestly I thought it was the body moving to where the ghost was
        I would use a hack like this to screw with my friends. Would be fucking hilarious, but would be lame if done too much.
    I was thinking hack at one point for sure.
    It was the screen glitches that tipped me off.
    Ditto, but now I really want this glitch to be real for Halloween
    Lmaooo me toooo oh goshhh
    (y)same
    Same.
    Ditto, but now I really want this glitch to be real for Halloween
Terrifying..... but still an amazing animation 😅!!!
    Thank you!!
        Well the amount of animations among us has inspired is very good and you are probably one of the top tier ones
            I liked it.
                Me too.

            Me too! Or a hack
            Ass out?

        This had such a high r/imsorryjon potential, bravo!
        So good i thought the guy used hacks!!!
        Did you make this?

Edit, just saw your other comment saying you did. Awesome work dude, I think it's the best among us animation I've seen yet!
        U really deserve an award, here is one
        HAHA I have Night mares now
    I was half expecting the body to swing itself about by the bone.
        I was half expecting the bone to become some kind of weapon
            I was expecting the mini crewmate to beat the hell out of it like a baseball bat
    This is an animation? I could have sworn it was just an in game glitch

Edit: okay I didn’t watch it all. Obviously it’s an animation. An amazing one tho!
    If his name was Fred, it could be more terrifying
Wtf was that? A cyborg mini crewmate?
    What if the mini crewmate has another mini crewmate controlling it
        Its like those dolls when you open theres a smaller version of it inside
            Matrioshka dolls or however you spell that word
                Matrioshka I believe
                    I thought it was matryoshka
                        That’s what I’d go with; it’s the closest transliteration of матрёшка
                    Thanks I edited it
            Mamushkas?
                Babushki?
                    Babushka?
            I hate those things; they're so full of themselves...
        It's mini crewmates all the way down.

    What's the music at 0:33 from??
        I'm wondering if you're just joking because it seems like you're asking about the [Among Us main menu music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq2mpQ_0JuE).
            Ok I wasn't joking but I feel like I've heard it somewhere else... Thanks though

    Ejecting himself was hilarious. Now I’m going to wonder which part of the ship someone is getting ejected from each time.
    Amazing work, what software did you use to make it all come together?
        appreciate it, I used after effects!
At first I thought this was just a really bad ping issue but was mistaken
    Terribly terribly mistaken.
all the winning crewmates backing into the corner on the victory screen really completes the scene
    I have actually forgot it was a crewmate
    that cartoon scaredy shaking sound is just perfect
        Yes! I loved that! I wonder where OP found the sound effects for this. I tried searching "scared shaking rattling cartoon sound effect" but nothing came up.

            Lemme see that backpage though
This is terrifying. Holy crap. I woulda crapped my pants if a dead body just started walking in game.
    Yeah, absolutely. Silliness aside, that opening bit was really creepypasta-esque.
        You got that right!
There should be some sort of way to do kills as imposter by throwing someone out of the garbage chute.
    Chute* not shoot
        Shoot 'em out of the chute.
    It could be really cool if each task had a specific animation if you get killed while you're doing it. Some tasks like download would be pretty much impossible to do but imagine dying of electric choc when you're fixing wirings or something.
Reminds me of those horror stories where a murder would kill someone, then the ghost of the victim would terrorise the murderer
I was legitimately worried we were about to have a "What are you doing, step bro!?" moment at the end of that. 

Great animation!
    LMAO
    I'm stuck step sus
What did the mini crewmate do to his own parent?
    Not his parent, his robot.
        why not both.
            But they created the robot, so in a way, that's their child, or dare I say, Mega Crewmate.
Guys, I think this is fake. Impostor can't do tasks.
    They learned pretty quick when faced with that predicament.

Gotta say, really had me in the first half.
You ever walk up to another imposters kill and you don’t know if you should report or vent away
    Report. If someone saw you walk in there, you're going down for it.
I really thought this was going to be another bug in the game. Then I see the kill countdown change to infinity and I'm like, wtf is that another glitch? Then the creepy music starts and red pulls out his own bone and that's when I realize it's an animation. Nicely done!

Damn bro, among us 2 lookin kinda wack.
*pulls out back bone* 

IVE GOTTA BONE TO PICK WITH YOU
Muscle memory got me .. I heard the music at the end and the "play again" button popped up. I tried pressing it ..
Bro the way Red was slapping that bone against his hand that's some fucking Baldi's Basics shit!!
This should have 7.7B updoots
I was like "Stupid cheaters" but then I watched the rest of the video and I was like, "Pixar animation studios play Among Us too?"
All honesty that should be an update for Halloween where the bodies can run around after they have been
Killed
Welp that’s what I git for following among us on Reddit
Dude... how are ya'll so creative???
When you have to wonder if you're really the imposter
This deserves a second gold so here take one
Take my gold 🤧
Red’s Dead Redemption
Yo I thought this was a glitch! Good job OP, this was fun to watch
This is perfect for this time of year and is really well animated. I hate it!
THIS 👏IS👏SO👏FREAKING👏COOL👏

OH MY GOD, THE DEAD BODY JUST GETTING UP IN THE CONER OF THE EYE IS JUST GREAT. A BIT OF SPOOPS, BEFORE REVEALING THE TWIST AT THE END LOL, ANYWAYS GOOD SHIT MAN 😩👍
Well, looks like Red had a BONE to pick with Blue!

Alright, I’ll see myself out.
No way this must be made by the same studio who made made the game i can swear. If I’m wrong well done whoever made this and thank you
Damm people are so talented. Seeing how creative people are is worth living.
If I coins I’d 100% give this platinum
For a sec there I thought this was a glitch
Well that's me not sleeping tonight
I dont think we can top this
This is amazing! My favorite parts were the impostor going out the chute and the crewmates huddling in fear at the end lol
Hahaha! That was amazing and the end victory with everyone shaking LOOL.. Epic
that's REALLY some quality content my friend
This is some good stuff, well done dude
Wow I thought that was a bug for a while there. Well done
This made my day. Thank you.
This is amazing. Love the subtleties you added along the way
My phone died at the same time red showed up and the sound played. Room dark and the sound was playing in my head. How is it possible among us is scaring me? Damn!
If that happened to me I’d be soooo freaked out haha great video!
For a minute I legit thought it was real
Wow. Made me smile like a dummy by how amazing this is. Thanks for that. Do more!!
This is very well made! What software do you use or how on earth do you make something like this? xD
    Thanks! And I used after effects :)
I was really hopinh red would’ve pulled out zabuzas sword
This scared me a lot more than I’d like to admit LOL
I honestly thought it was the legit game at first
The horror mode for Among Us
Nice Editing Skills Brudda
It’s the throbbing calfs for me lmao 😂
Omg, what a fresh concept! Something I never would have come up with. What a stellar animation!
Mini crewmate after pulling bone out be like:

**YOUR FREE TRIAL OF HAVING KNEE CAPS HAS EXPIRED**
I'd be scared shitless if I would see that too, I would eject myself too
Red Dead Redemption
they should make this a temporary update for halloween kinda like the april fools updates of minecraft
in soviet russia you don’t kill the victim the victim kills you
I was about to admit that that was actually a cool hack.
OP you beautiful bastard
The sus thing is that the quit button is gone.
This was really awesome
Mini-Red's Revenge!
This is one of the best posts I've ever seen in my life, Bravo. Bravo.
This is amazing. Have some silver, its the most i can do sorry
It would be soo cool if out of nowhere , they synced the dead bodies and the ghost's movement for the Halloween update and after killing the ghosts move as half bodies
“Creepy and Unnecessary, but kinda Cool”
- Jacksfilms (I think the quote fits this post pretty well)
Thought this was gonna be one of those terrible jokes when someone says the dead person is sus, but it ended up being amazing!
I hate when I eject my self .I’m actually typing this in the fabric of space rn .it’s rlly nice up here kinda chilly tho.
Wow, this is so cool and real looking! I love the animation!
Actually pretty terrifying
This is the type of Among Us content we need
He is an excellent artist with his own style. His style is unique.
Red kinda sus
You drew and made all the backgrounds and props by hand?!
This happened to me too once
If that's was real it would have been pretty scary
    I mean real in Among Us, not real in real life
Ping has left the chat
I came on reddit at 4:30am trying to sleep but you know what? Fuck it
It’s so terrifyingly good I love it!

Well done!
Some real “I’m Sorry Jon” vibes.
Of course it’s red
Holy shit, that’s scary. If that happened to me i would have just killed my self.
Ok that baby crewmate really be lookin kinda sus
This actually sick!
holy shit that was horrifyingly epic
Nobody questions the elevated one.
if i had an award ill give it to u

the last time i checked, no awards.
That bone part reminds me of attack on titan somehow...
"I found a copy of among us at a garage sale"
That is so terrifying 

I hate this

And I love it
I’ve got a bone to pick with you
What are you doing step-imposter? 0:56
Mom I’m scared come pick me up
Amazing job!!
This is so creative and cool ! Good job man

Nice one! Super great animation dude, red is always sus tbh.
You had me in the first half not gonna lie
This sub is full of so much garbage that I was hesitant to watch... but this was great.
Everyone gangster til' the corpse starts walking 🚶‍♂️
THAT WAS GREAT IT WAS SCARY AT THE START AND HILARIOUS AT THE END!!!
Why is the walking so smooth?
Wish I had an award to give you, dude.
When it’s October 👆🏽
**ultra instinct theme starts playing**
*Red was kicked from the game*
Was prob a dev in your game
First i tought someone was going to report the body and accises him then i tought that was a bug that the dead body moves and now...
That was ummm yeah. Time for some coffee and cookies and hope for sweet dreams 🤣
**sqwombs has ejected himself.**
Took me a second to realize this was animated lol I was SO confused when red started walking 😅🤦 nice job though :)
The part where he ran away reminded me of Ao Oni
I came here for a fun game, not a horror movie
Lmao this is literally a work of art
Just imagine that happening in a real game of among us-
That’s one way to get rid of an Imposter
If my calculations are correct, at the time of this posting, 382 awards were received. Also at the time of me posting this comment: this person has recieved 16405 coins, and like 15000 was from there being 2 party trains. 2 party trains may not seem like much but 380 awards makes it super powerful.
    In other words, this dude won't run out of coins anytime soon. Congrats. You're a rich person.
When the cooldown goes on infinity
Every copy of Among Us is personalized...
I thought it was a glitch at first
Imagine a mechanic similar to this existed in game the imposter could see the glimpses of the ghosts of everyone they’ve killed in the match
What in the actually fxxk is this lmao
Well, someone's got a bone to pick with you.
Fucking hackers
Bruh, I literally went “wtf” when I saw the body move and then I went “karma, ever heard of her?” Good animation tho! Perfect for spook-tober 👌
Animation was spot on
not me literally thinking this was a hacker at first. this was so well done, holy crap.
This was amazing...
I like to imagine animations for this game and many others that contradict how they actually play (like those 1 vs 99 animations) mess up the game on an internal level, and the glitches to the hud really emphasizes that it's something out of the ordinary and makes this more terrifying. Great job.
Now this, this is epic
"But it refused."
This is amazing, love the ominous music as well got Left 4 Dead vibes from it
I felt like i was actually watching a horror game.This is amazing
thats a LOT of awards
brings me back some DDLC vibes. awesome job!
that is so well made!
I thought this was real at first and got freaked out
I though it was gameplay at first
Lmao I actually though it was happening in game
I love this maybe too much
I WAS LOOKING FOR THIS FOR 30 MINUTES AND I FINALLY FOUND IT AGAIN

THIS IS GOOD SHIT

How spooky, take my updoot!
If you put more Hyperrealistic blood and you crying at the end then this would’ve been a shitty Creepypasta
excuse me for being dumb but HOW
    it's an animation
That's terrifying. I love it.
    why is it downvoted?
        Because the reddit hive mind has decided
            the reddit hivemind is scary

    No shit sherlock. It only takes 2 braincells to find out this was not done in among us

    what?
        Now we are getting hacker accusations on animations
If this is a joke it's not funny
            1. Sorry I made such a terrible joke, and I was aware it was an animation 2. You replied to the wrong comment fuckstick
                The second point was unnecessarily rude
                    No shit Sherlock
            this is funny
I can't wait for this game to be a dead body
    let me guess, another person hating on the game just because its popular?
        He came from hating on Fall Guys, now be hates on Among Us.
        I paid for the game just being sus brah
Did the mini crewmate just pull a rick and Morty?
Nice animation

aw man i once ejected myself at prom it was really embarassing
He’s got a bone to pick with blue
Is no one bout to talk about this the fuckin .25 speed he’s got here lmao
That was awesome. Great animation. Had me in the first half not eem gonna lie.
i would have sabotaged lol

If I was the impostor and it did that shit I'd probably uninstall the game.

AMONG US CREEPYPASTA
Red Dead Redemption
What a masterpiece
Is this the update?
I still think that the imposter should be able to see ghosts. They are always haunted by the ones they killed.
This felt like the basis of modern video game creepypasta honestly, I love it.
It’s my personal belief that the character I control is actually controlled by my little buddy, who uses it as a meat shield and to reach higher up tasks.
Why did I try to press play again... smh
I thought there was gonna be a Skewer on the other side of the bone
I guess red had a... ***bone to pick with blue***
Halloween update.
I love this! It reminds me of a Creepypasta.
We're those Metroid Fusion sound effects? The steps definitely sounded like the Samus-X encounters.
This animation was so well done I thought it was a modded game. This really oughtta inspire a new gamemode. Quality work!

holy crap its baldi
Okay, this is top quality.
This has to be my favorite one yet!
Uuh nice, i noticed the infinity symbol, but not the transition
    same
Ikr, I thought it was just netcode problems! Well done OP with the subtlety
Ha imagine the lore of the imposter always seeing the crewmates body lurking around 

*always watching*
    I'd love for an option to have the imposter see ghosts. Let him be haunted by those he killed (or were wrongfully ejected).
        Fuck that, I just got some Doctor Who PTSD of the weeping angels from this. If I turned a corner and saw half a dude just standing there I'd probably poo a little.
            OH imagine how creepy it would be if they worked like the weeping angels and could only move when you can't see them!
                Oh god, suddenly the lights going out become way stronger.

        I wish imps could see the ghost chat. I always wanna see what people say about me when I’m the imp.
        You know this might be a nice feature cause then that would add extra stress to the impostor
        Halloween event for this would be epic.

Same lmao. I was like NOPE NOPE NOPE DONT LIKE THIS ONE BIT😳😳😳

😂
I though Red was cheating
    Honestly I thought it was the body moving to where the ghost was
    I would use a hack like this to screw with my friends. Would be fucking hilarious, but would be lame if done too much.
I was thinking hack at one point for sure.
It was the screen glitches that tipped me off.
Ditto, but now I really want this glitch to be real for Halloween
Lmaooo me toooo oh goshhh

Edit, just saw your other comment saying you did. Awesome work dude, I think it's the best among us animation I've seen yet!
    U really deserve an award, here is one
    HAHA I have Night mares now
I was half expecting the body to swing itself about by the bone.
    I was half expecting the bone to become some kind of weapon
        I was expecting the mini crewmate to beat the hell out of it like a baseball bat
This is an animation? I could have sworn it was just an in game glitch

Edit: okay I didn’t watch it all. Obviously it’s an animation. An amazing one tho!
If his name was Fred, it could be more terrifying
What if the mini crewmate has another mini crewmate controlling it
    Its like those dolls when you open theres a smaller version of it inside
        Matrioshka dolls or however you spell that word
            Matrioshka I believe
                I thought it was matryoshka
                    That’s what I’d go with; it’s the closest transliteration of матрёшка

Ejecting himself was hilarious. Now I’m going to wonder which part of the ship someone is getting ejected from each time.
Amazing work, what software did you use to make it all come together?
    appreciate it, I used after effects!
Terribly terribly mistaken.
I have actually forgot it was a crewmate
that cartoon scaredy shaking sound is just perfect
    Yes! I loved that! I wonder where OP found the sound effects for this. I tried searching "scared shaking rattling cartoon sound effect" but nothing came up.

Yeah, absolutely. Silliness aside, that opening bit was really creepypasta-esque.
    You got that right!
Chute* not shoot
    Shoot 'em out of the chute.
It could be really cool if each task had a specific animation if you get killed while you're doing it. Some tasks like download would be pretty much impossible to do but imagine dying of electric choc when you're fixing wirings or something.
LMAO
I'm stuck step sus
Not his parent, his robot.
    why not both.
        But they created the robot, so in a way, that's their child, or dare I say, Mega Crewmate.
They learned pretty quick when faced with that predicament.

it's an animation
why is it downvoted?
