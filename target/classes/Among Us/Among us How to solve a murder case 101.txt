[[Among us How to solve a murder case 101]]





HAHAHAHAH the little scream at the end killed me. Loved the hand details too.

Honestly knowing the location of most people as an innocent really shoots me in the foot so now I keep my mouth shut.
    Won me a game once. As Impostor that is. I killed someone in security, vented over to electrical and then passed by yellow in lower engine (impostor vision was like 5 and crewmate was 0.75 so I saw yellow coming a mile away and went to lower engine to pretend I was doing a task and didn't just walk out of electric yellow was coming from storage) then yi went through storage to get to admin to check where everyone was so I could wait out my kill-countdown and murderize one more person to win. Anyways yellow finds the body and immediately mentions how they were at admin and how they saw that one person was in navigation, one was in admin and two were in security. Then one person disappeared from security then another one and then immediately after a person appeared in electric (only 3 crewmates left so everyone was in a room at the time) and then they say how I was the only one who could have been it because black was literally on the opposite side of the map.

My defense was "You were checking admin? That's pretty sus..." and it fucking worked. And I just want to say I shouldn't have won that game. I should not have won that.
        I dressed up in the blue cop hat, blue pants, and blue pet dog, as purple.

I killed someone right in front of another guy.  He saw me do it.  He says "blue did it".

Someone else said "but blue is already dead"

"Oh then I don't know who"

The guy saw me murder right in front of him lol
            Pay to win!
                But it's all free
                    The pants and pet?
                        Yeah man, I don't know what the dollar sign is for cause i just click and have them all
                            I can use pants for free, I have to pay for pets tho
                                Mobile users have to pay for skins
            I always wear the suit and yellow hard hat as a red character so if I murderize someone and I’m barely seen above or below the wrong color will get reported
            Big ooof on his part lol
        LOL that's a GG right there, bud.
        Yellow must have been ready to give up on humanity after that

Edit for typo
            Nah she's fine. I apologized to her too (yellow was a friend and we were in vc, the other player was a rando)
        That's something taken straight out of the Death Note
            Same level of asspull
        I had a game the other night where we were down to final four, other imposter gone, tasks were nearly done. I was shitting myself, thinking how am I going to kill two more before task victory without being seen or sussed. On impulse I followed black after the meeting, like a buddy system. Black goes straight to security. We sit there on cams. I’m trying to decide what to do when suddenly a meeting is called. Ok, at least black saw me the whole time, I’ll have an ally at this meeting.

Wait a minute...pink is dead. They must have logged off. But the other two didn’t *see* them log off.

Relieved, black and I vote off the dangerous imposter yellow.

Black turns at the wet sound of my head unfolding...
        I want to give yellow a hug :(
        All you have to say is sus and whoever you are going against gets kicked out
        I won one that I shouldn't have. Only had the time because one ghost didn't know to complete their tasks. But everyone was clumped on top of eachother (me included), so I just hit the kill button. No one could tell who did it. Managed to vote out some bystander. Then last kill was easy, hit the reactor follow them out there and as soon as the kill cooldown resets, get a kill before the emergency meeting cooldown resets.
Admin is right next to storage
    i’eah i’ou could pretty easily just walk down the hallway and have all the statements line up lol
        How do you know what map he’s talking about?
            To be fair, distributor calibration is only on The Skeld
                what even is that lol
                    [calibrate distributor](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmongUs/comments/ifmqwi/calibrate_distributor_task_is_a_pain_i_have_never/?utm_source=amp&utm_medium=&utm_content=post_num_comments)
                        I've never ever had this task while playing. Am I just absurdly unlucky?
                            No, you're absurdly *lucky*

This task is a pain in the asscheeks, and you get killed easily while doing it
                                I don’t know how people think it’s a pain. It’s easy as fuck for me.
                                    Same here but I get it almost every time I play so I’ve just memorized the speeds of each wheel
                                    Wow, you must be a really talented gamer pro
                                    yellow sus
                                Do people really have trouble with this task? Imo it's the second fastest electrical task after the divert power task.
                                    What about wires, those are easy af
                                I don’t get why people are saying this is hard, this is a fast task if you just hit each button one after another since the circles often line themselves up
                                    I’ve never had them line up properly for that
                                I thought it was quick and easy. Worst is meteors because they don't send them out fast enough, so even doing it perfectly takes awhile. Been killed during meteors soooo many times.
                                Distributor is fine, it's doing up/download in electrical that wracks my nerves.
                                Download task is far more annoying imo.

But I still don't know how to fix sabotaged Comms.
                                Simon says takes waay longer and flthe fuel task is more annoying.
                                Do y’all not have timing? You just click as soon as it connects.
                                really? ive always found all of the electrical tasks to be easy.
                            If anything you're absurdly *lucky*, calibrate distributor is so easy to get stuck on for ages
                            Me too! It took probably over 30 games before I got it. Now I get it a lot 😞.
                        ah, i stand corrected.
            distributor calibration+the only map with “storage” as a common callout, at least among the group of people i play with. i’m looking at the map now and yeah I didn’t realize there were other places called storage on different maps, but ive heard that called closet and gas on mira and polus respectively
                those are probably named after the most common task you got to do in there. the watering can (part 1)  in mira hq and fuel engines or whatever on polus
            To be fair, red was thrown into space at the ejection at the end, suggesting it’s the skeld
                Big brain
                    Not really, it's pretty obvious
            Uh red gets thrown out of skeld?
            The space ejection is only in skeld
            Calibrate distributor is only on skeld
                Been told already
        **HOLD IT**

If so how could red have known the body is in electrical is blue didn’t specify?
            If you're looking at admin, you could see the body disappear from electrical. You could then end up in storage walking to the body to see if you pass by anyone along the way.
                Don't dead bodies stay on admin don't they?
                    I'm not sure how admin works exactly. I've been told that if you're watching admin and a kill happens, the body count will flicker down and back.
                        off topic, but this reminds me of my friend's 2000IQ move. he was watching in admin, saw 3 of us were in electrical, and saw the 5th person move immediately between two places connected by a vent. called a meeting and asked which 3 of us were in electrical and convinced us to vote out the other.
                **OBJECTION**

Then why wouldn’t you report?
                    If you're in admin walking to electrical to find the body but the report happened before you arrived at electrical, you would be in storage.

Of course, this still goes against the initial claim of "I was in storage doing a task"
                        **HOLD IT**

    Yeah on Skeld. Not the same their maps.
    It could be a map other then the spaceship
        Only map with the elecetric ring thing task
            That one really sucks but fair point, objection overruled
        It literally shows what map it is
    And when did he specify what map it was on?! Lime is the impostor
        Once again, only map with a specified electric task
        At the end, when red gets ejected, it's not that hard.
    Not on MIRA or Polus
        Mira and Polus don't have Calibrate Distributors, meaning it has to be The Skeld.
Blue sus.

                                    Oh, I think they do.
                                    [removed]
                                Fine, but vote green next round.
                                    Greens dead
                                This was very entertaining
                                    That’s sus
                    Can you even fake scan? I've gone there as the impostor and can't do it.
                        I think you used to be able to, but now you can't
                            Yeah, they patched it a long time ago. Imposter could get scan task and complete it
                            You can still turn off visual task confirms. But then if you wanna fake scan you gotta stand Riiight in the middle.
                                And do the little trot up onto it where it takes over and does a few steps.
                        Once I accused because I saw someone standing on the scanner but didn't see the scan. I thought for sure I was about to nail this imposter but like two other people saw it happen and were like 'bruh, you watched him scan'.

Then I got thrown out the airlock.
                            > Then I got thrown out the airlock.

Finally, some sweet justice.
                        What’s up with your book?
                        You just overlay while another scsns
                            Would that work with a ghost helping you?
                                Iirc ghosts don't have a visible scan ever
                                    You could do it with the asteroid shooter. I know that it fires when a ghost does it. That’s how I found out someone was dead before anyone found the body. Poor red
                                I doubt it
                        No you can’t
                        Its kinda simple thanks to the task animation visibility toggle update no one can confirm you did or didn't actually scan unless they actually have scan and it doesn't show they're waiting in a queue for you to finish or someone watches the task bar like a hawk. And it's even more easy if there are two impostors. You can both just say you watched each other on the scan queue and as long as no one can tell for sure the rises on the task bar aren't from your scan tasks you can be clear of suspicion for a good minute or more unless your whole lobby is full of YOLO voters
                no its not yellow
                Yellow vented
                Black was ejected. 

“Guys I literally just said Black scanned, why did you vote him??”

“...”

You were ejected.

            Wasn’t me, I was in vents
                Understandable have a nice day
            "Wtf you idiots I told you blue scanned at the beginning of the game, y'all are fkn dumb"
            Why does the game always capitalize "An" snd "The"
                It looks more dramatic I guess
                Idk why but when I read it, in my mind I put more emphasis on "An" and "Imposter" because the first letters are capitalized.

            Damn the stars make it seem real
            Aight who suggested we vote blue? They are obviously the imposter
        That is the realistic version of this
    *PTSD flashback to my first game*

I had no idea what I was doing, so I was wondering the ship, looking for my tasks, but then someone called an emergency meeting, told everyone to kick me because "Blue is sus" 

I didn't even have time to type before they voted me out and then the game suddenly said "imposter wins" even though there were like 8 other players left. 

I still need to learn how to play this thing.
        If the game suddenly says imposter wins with 8 players alive, that's a bug, or the host quit.
            hey guys,  


Blue is sus.
        That was my experience last night...
            >  didn't even have time to type before they voted me out

Yep, that was my experience. Decided it was not very fun. Might play again with family or friends down the line.

Ninja* Missed the word "not".
                I'd say definitely play with friends or family, it's much more fun than playing with strangers
                I've only played with friends in voice chat and it's wonderful, but I can't imagine trying to have a game typing with randos, wouldn't be a shred of fun.
    Would have been funnier if it said "Red Was Not The Imposter"
        Would have been funnier if they ejected cyan
            It's not funny when my printer does it.
        I was thinking the same thing. When you're so sure someone is the imposter but it turns out they weren't.
    *cyan
        thank you! i scrolled all the way down looking for this.
    Watch him pull an updated autopsy report out of his ass
    Voted blue. Who needs proof.


Sorry blue. Green.
    Blue: “I’m dead”
    Then everyone kicks dark blue instead of CYAN
    Toast has entered the chat
    Ikr, he shouldn’t be so critical, he could’ve blown his cover if he was imposter...
    I hate it when that's their argument and everyone goes with it


Especially if you've done Every. Single. Task. So far, Because APPARENTLY drawing a line from one side to the other to fix wires is VERY COMPLICATED and SWIPING A CARD IS OF COURSE SOMETHING NO ONE ELSE COULD DO 

AAAANNNNNDDD.....
    Red saw me scan in medical.

And Green was with me when the lights were out.
        Wait..but red was in storage..
            He was at some point, true. The scanning happened, like, a meeting and a half ago.
                That’s not true, I didn’t see you scan when I was watching you from the *vents* a bit ago.
                    NANI?!

Also pls don't download this and post it elsewhere without giving credit; I have other socials too where I post my stuff, and people stealing is happening pretty often lately
edit: here's the yt link https://youtu.be/_lLmodkv8R4
    Good thing u watermark the video
        Gonna just slap a big 😂 over it and get those sweet internet bucks
            🤣LMAO SO TRUE 🤣 in a big white bar.
                🤣 this is literally me🤣
                    🤣🤣WHO DID THIS🤣🤣
                        It was red. They sus
                            "red was not An Impostor"
                                FUCK
                        🤣🤣man I just wanna be loved🤣🤣
            Oh shit, is that why they do that? Never realized
                Naw its not but now they got the idea
                    Trust me the idea has been out there for a while. That’s why people started having more intrusive watermarks like memetang or funwaa so they just slap some huge logo over someone else’s memes. 

Ebaumsworld was doing this pre-emoji so the practice has definitely been out for at least a decade.

    well surely i wouldnt do that, but red might
        kinda sus that you're blaming others without proof
    I will ensure I give credit, also, you have a watermark on this, so It wouldn't be easy to steal anyway
    Don't worry. This will absolutely be stolen and spread without credit.

It has a watermark that can't be cropped out, so you should be fine on that department.
    I’ll share the link with my friends cause this was great lmao
    Why did you make Cyan‘s name Blue
    Welcome to the internet young padawan !
    There's like 5 download bot comments from a quick scroll in the comments already.
Fully expected this video to end with blue being accused for self reporting the body.
    That's the way it goes
        \>be me

\>see green kill red

\>report what i saw

\>get vented

rinse and repeat
            Crewmates that play 2nd and 3rd imposter are to blame for that.

            Hey, I saw (you) in vents
            I've started only speaking up if i'm positive who did it, then I say it's them, kick me after if not.  That seems to work >75% of the time.
            >be me

                Sounds about right, and this was a game where I wasnt with randoms. I see the killer remove a guys head, report, and after telling the rest I just watched him do it, all it took for me to get vented (after doing visual tasks with other people) was "Bull shit, I saw you come out of the vent and kill him."

Then the imposters almost won because after ANOTHER person accused him of venting, these people nearly voted the guy who called the meeting.
    Yeah I expected that too but it's already a bit of a stale punchline at this point, so I appreciated the purity of this.
    I quit reporting bodies, I just run away from them if no one is with me to confirm I didn’t kill them. What sucks is when people see you fleeing from it and think you killed them. It’s very hard to win
        Well doesn't that make you lose more often?
            It depends. I’m still figuring out if I’m better off risking getting caught fleeing or getting “seems like a self report”-ed.
                Well it might make you more likely to die but also more likely to win.  IF no one reports then the Imposters have more time to make more kills and longer for the body to be cold
                you're better off risking the self report. If they don't believe you and vote you out, that's on them that they lost. if you run away and get caught, that's basically another free kill for the imposter, and if you lose, it's on you.
        Dont do that lol that just makes shit more confusing. You still win if teammates win even if u dead.
damn this is really cool. see you in hot

    Top all time in the sub.
    See you at top post of this entire sub
    It's going to the TOP I'm telling you
This is beautiful and very well made, it really fits so well. also it's very realistic with people always mistaking cyan for blue. other than that it's my eternal dream to have a high-iq discussion like that in a game
    i always use cyan, unless anyone else got it before i entered the room, and ive heard people say turquoise, light blue, baby blue, cyan, teal, and blue. Im like, can you all just say cyan

&#x200B;

edit: forgot teal
        and to any smartass going to type "no it's light blue", do this:

* pick whatever the f the thing's color is
* go to med scan and scan urself
* look at the your stats, you should find out ur age, blood type AND ESPECIALLY COLOR
        Never teal?
        That's a good strategy. People are less likely to talk about you if they don't know what to call you.
        i have seen 'aqua'
    play with friends consistently and youll all be so good at the game you will have high IQ conversations like that
Dude I wish games were like this. Actual deduction, plot twists, and drama. Not just random accusations.
    No you need to mash emergency meeting 10 seconds into the game and then randomly accuse anyone or even yourself.
        Had people do this in a recent game. I was the impostor and didn't kill anyone and they kept accusing each other and ejecting each other. I waited till there was three left, killed one, blamed one guy and I surprisingly got away with it. They killed each other of for me haha
            Today I had a fellow impostor call an emergency meeting and immediately say that they and me were the impostors... first time I was an impostor today and my ass was immediately ejected after.
                what an asshole
                Fuck that guy
    I had to put the discussion timer up to like 90 seconds and voting to 30 seconds so people actually discuss but they just end up complaining
        Oh my God I wondered why people had huge discussion times. I will never leave again.
            What discussion time do you normally play with? The lobbies I join are always either 90 or 120, mostly 90 though.
                90
        I know i get full lobby but everybody leaves when they realize discussion time is 60s

Good thing its still fun with friends on discord
This is too high quality for this page, great job OP!
    Ikr I've heard so much about this game, but when I finally tried my first round everyone just starting spamming blue is gay and then cyan got voted off.
        Dude I swear I don't know what the hell kinda lobbies you all playing on, this **never** happens to me
        Lol
    This sub has actually some of the most high quality gaming content I’ve ever seen.
>Name is blue

>Color is cyan
    Ikr I was confused at first
        Why are your upvote downvote icons different
            I don’t see anything different, so I can’t help you.
                They're the imposter.
Mr Red almost won that argument. Better luck next time I guess
    Little White must be so sad right now.
how do I go into the vents like red tho
    Honestly the amount of times i see this....
        Honestly when I see someone say that it makes me think imposter right away now haha
    I thought stuff like that was just a meme, but someone actually was like “why is my name red???” I actually took a screenshot of it
        once i and someone else were imposter.
 they asked why are teal and mine names red.
        people say that shit in like every other match tho.
            Well I’ve never seen it outside of Reddit memes until then
        One time I said “This is only my second game. What does it mean when my names red” every one started throwing lols and explaining it. I wasn’t even the imposter. I was just doing it for shit and giggles. Then when they started dying each one asked why I lied lol.

How matches in public are:

Blue: Guys red vented

**Yellow voted**

**Blue voted**

**White voted**

**Green voted**

**Lime voted**

***Orange*** ***was not the impostor***
    Why would Orange get voted if the accusation is on Red ?

I love how the crewmates have the same mannerisms as phoenix and edgeworth
    Black also has Mia’s movements, and Yellow Franziska’s
    I think that's the point
What game is this again....I want it now.
    The one these animations are based on? It's called Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney. I'd reccomend the Trilogy on 3DS/Steam/All current gen systems.
        Such an incredible game. Never played the other games although I own the trilogy on iPhone
        You can also get it on iOS if that boats your float.
    Ace attorney series. 

The first game in the series is called phoenix wright ace attorney.

10/10 would recommend playing it.
the only flaw about this is that cyan is named blue while we accepted that the darker one is called blue, everything else is perfect

Thats such a cool video! Thats why i love when discussion time is 60 sec
The good old days
Epic
Beautiful.
the best thing I've seen all day
What the f**k is the name of that game?
    Ace attorney
If only the game was like this
This is so good but black sus
Well if it was on The Skeld, it'd be possible
I love that the imposter was actually caught instead of reusing the "u sus tho" ending twist that's been so overused lately
I love this
Lmao. They would have voted black.
What lobbies are y’all in cause this does not happen at all! More like blue seems sus let’s vote him out even though we have zero proof.
Great animation but how didn't you notice the entier time that you mixed-up blue and cyan?
u/VredditDownloader
Im surprised that red didn't say thats something like, Thats what a impostor would say or blue sounds kinda sus.
No, they would’ve voted cyan out instead
r/perfectlycutscreams would love this
Why is this so popular? I don't even. Know what's about lmao
When someone is acting sus, should I report or wait for more proof(Didn't vote the imp last vote, doesn't do tasks, etc.)? Usually, when I wait, I get killed in electrical for fixing the lights or  everyone else gets killed.
r/aceshitposts
I’m really feeling that Synthwave music
Hey no I'm not!
How come they have noses sometimes and not others....or is that big circle a mouth maybe.
This is seriously so good, great job
Plot twist: Red was not the impostor.
i wish my group was like this they play like “oh your sus” then they kill me
There’s one thing that’s the clincher in murder cases-the location of the crime. Only the killer and the one who discovered the body know the location. If anyone else knows the location, they’re the killer.
I really thought they were gonna send blue out
This was very impressive...
Damn what kind of People do you play with that have such civil discussions and doesnt Just scream
It should've been in the end

Red: blue is kinda sus

*Blue was not the imposter*
I'd people actually played like this
Yeah but in game it's never like this, it usually goes like this: 'it's red' "red was not the impostor", I hate this game because randos don't even provide or demand proof they play among us just like they gamble.
Congrats for reaching r/all/top/ (of the day, top 25) with your post!

Idk who the fuck gave this man ternion but god damn they deserve it

    Just have discussion time at like 60 seconds and voting at 15. Boom your problem is solved
        I do that, but nobody talks and we all just there waiting and everyone randomly votes. Not all the time but usually
Wait on skeld the storage and admin are in the same place

On Mira they are far apart but based on the ejection screen he was on skeld, Mayb blue sus after all
This was really good but everyone would be like: Cyan sus
How people imagine Among Us lobbies to be:

Wait, what? Storage is 1 room away from Admin in the Skeld, and it looks like Red was thrown out of a spaceship, so I'm pretty sure they were playing on the Skeld.
If only the real random game can be like this... it be super intense yet interesting. Most of the time was just sus-ing each other just because i say so and "trust me" lmao

The number of awards this thing was is more money then I have in my bank account

Hi
what's this court meme called because I've seen it lately and I was thinking where it came from
    It's from the Ace Attorney series, all of the trials took place in this court room. The animations that the crewmates do in this video reference specific characters form those games. Blue = Phoenix, Red = Edgeworth, etc.
feels more like danganronpa
    It's Ace Attorney.
Lmao, what's the sound at the end?
    "I like ya cut g"
Oh my god 😂😂😂
This was satisfying, take me free award
Holy shit this is the BEST thing
This was intense
I shall see this in hot my friend. Excellent job
Having this situation is the best when your playing the game
this is really cool
That guys red he’s kinda sus
I like to think their pets are sitting in the back of the court room
I was waiting for this to come out, I knew it would happen some day and thank god it didn't dissapoint.
Red sus all the time
more like

blue: i found brown's bo-

yellow: where

red: where

blue: it was in e-

black: where
this is legendary
this is perfect XD
now I wanna see a danganronpa version
This is bloody fantastic
Thank you for making this, op. I needed this in my life.
Loved the ending noise of a slap and scream lol
Damn, I love it! If only it was like that in the game and they wouldn’t vote me out all the goddamn time even tho I was a crewmate!

OBJECTION!
STORAGE AND ADMIN ARE RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER ON THE MAP!
Admin is right next to storage right? I guess It's a different map
This has a danganrompa scrum debate vibe too it
It’s more like this-
“Red sus”
End of voting
This gave me a good chuckle
They scream at the end lmao
u/vredditdownloader
it should've ended with someone else who didn't say anything before saying "idk blue kinda sus" and him getting ejected instead
The quality level of this sub's posts is WAAAAY to high damn
This gave me flashbacks to my first impostor game with my experienced friends, I can still feel the stress from my entire excuse tearing down
Beautiful
Man I fucking love this
THAT WAS SO GOOD OMGGGGGG 💖💖💖

anyways this reminds me of a time when this one guy was being bossy and kept having emergency meetings, but then we voted him off and he turned out to be the impostor.

Post this to r/gaming, they’ll love it
that really needed to end with "not the imposter" and reiterate that everyone is a smooth brain and everything they said was wrong. Or atleast red confusing names/locations
I would be funnier if at the end red saved himself by saying “yellow sus” and yellow gets  ejected, it’s more realistic lol
holy shit this is literally the funniest fucking post I've ever seen
Thats Cyan, that aint me!
u/vredditdownloader
For once an among us meme but not with its template
I like ya cut g
How did you get the backgrounds and sound effects for this?
Unrealistic, all red had to say was self rep and everyone wouldve voted blue out even if they saw him med scan
That body report is...

*Outdated*

No but seriously Ace Attorney fits pretty well with Among Us lmao
You should crosspost this to /r/AceAttorney, this is amazing!
This except it ends with Red was not an Imposter...
Most conversations do go like this, but end up with Blue getting voted out somehow
Wait those are mouths? I thought they had little helmet bubbles.
Red could have easily saved himself. All he had to say was “Blue sus.”

r/perfectlycutscreams
Won me a game once. As Impostor that is. I killed someone in security, vented over to electrical and then passed by yellow in lower engine (impostor vision was like 5 and crewmate was 0.75 so I saw yellow coming a mile away and went to lower engine to pretend I was doing a task and didn't just walk out of electric yellow was coming from storage) then yi went through storage to get to admin to check where everyone was so I could wait out my kill-countdown and murderize one more person to win. Anyways yellow finds the body and immediately mentions how they were at admin and how they saw that one person was in navigation, one was in admin and two were in security. Then one person disappeared from security then another one and then immediately after a person appeared in electric (only 3 crewmates left so everyone was in a room at the time) and then they say how I was the only one who could have been it because black was literally on the opposite side of the map.

My defense was "You were checking admin? That's pretty sus..." and it fucking worked. And I just want to say I shouldn't have won that game. I should not have won that.
    I dressed up in the blue cop hat, blue pants, and blue pet dog, as purple.

I killed someone right in front of another guy.  He saw me do it.  He says "blue did it".

Someone else said "but blue is already dead"

"Oh then I don't know who"

The guy saw me murder right in front of him lol
        Pay to win!
            But it's all free
                The pants and pet?
                    Yeah man, I don't know what the dollar sign is for cause i just click and have them all
                        I can use pants for free, I have to pay for pets tho
                            Mobile users have to pay for skins
        I always wear the suit and yellow hard hat as a red character so if I murderize someone and I’m barely seen above or below the wrong color will get reported
        Big ooof on his part lol
    LOL that's a GG right there, bud.
    Yellow must have been ready to give up on humanity after that

Edit for typo
        Nah she's fine. I apologized to her too (yellow was a friend and we were in vc, the other player was a rando)
    That's something taken straight out of the Death Note
        Same level of asspull
    I had a game the other night where we were down to final four, other imposter gone, tasks were nearly done. I was shitting myself, thinking how am I going to kill two more before task victory without being seen or sussed. On impulse I followed black after the meeting, like a buddy system. Black goes straight to security. We sit there on cams. I’m trying to decide what to do when suddenly a meeting is called. Ok, at least black saw me the whole time, I’ll have an ally at this meeting.

Wait a minute...pink is dead. They must have logged off. But the other two didn’t *see* them log off.

Relieved, black and I vote off the dangerous imposter yellow.

Black turns at the wet sound of my head unfolding...
    I want to give yellow a hug :(
    All you have to say is sus and whoever you are going against gets kicked out
    I won one that I shouldn't have. Only had the time because one ghost didn't know to complete their tasks. But everyone was clumped on top of eachother (me included), so I just hit the kill button. No one could tell who did it. Managed to vote out some bystander. Then last kill was easy, hit the reactor follow them out there and as soon as the kill cooldown resets, get a kill before the emergency meeting cooldown resets.
i’eah i’ou could pretty easily just walk down the hallway and have all the statements line up lol
    How do you know what map he’s talking about?
        To be fair, distributor calibration is only on The Skeld
            what even is that lol
                [calibrate distributor](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmongUs/comments/ifmqwi/calibrate_distributor_task_is_a_pain_i_have_never/?utm_source=amp&utm_medium=&utm_content=post_num_comments)
                    I've never ever had this task while playing. Am I just absurdly unlucky?
                        No, you're absurdly *lucky*

This task is a pain in the asscheeks, and you get killed easily while doing it
                            I don’t know how people think it’s a pain. It’s easy as fuck for me.
                                Same here but I get it almost every time I play so I’ve just memorized the speeds of each wheel
                                Wow, you must be a really talented gamer pro
                                yellow sus
                            Do people really have trouble with this task? Imo it's the second fastest electrical task after the divert power task.
                                What about wires, those are easy af
                            I don’t get why people are saying this is hard, this is a fast task if you just hit each button one after another since the circles often line themselves up
                                I’ve never had them line up properly for that
                            I thought it was quick and easy. Worst is meteors because they don't send them out fast enough, so even doing it perfectly takes awhile. Been killed during meteors soooo many times.
                            Distributor is fine, it's doing up/download in electrical that wracks my nerves.
                            Download task is far more annoying imo.

But I still don't know how to fix sabotaged Comms.
                            Simon says takes waay longer and flthe fuel task is more annoying.
                            Do y’all not have timing? You just click as soon as it connects.
                            really? ive always found all of the electrical tasks to be easy.
                        If anything you're absurdly *lucky*, calibrate distributor is so easy to get stuck on for ages
                        Me too! It took probably over 30 games before I got it. Now I get it a lot 😞.
                    ah, i stand corrected.
        distributor calibration+the only map with “storage” as a common callout, at least among the group of people i play with. i’m looking at the map now and yeah I didn’t realize there were other places called storage on different maps, but ive heard that called closet and gas on mira and polus respectively
            those are probably named after the most common task you got to do in there. the watering can (part 1)  in mira hq and fuel engines or whatever on polus
        To be fair, red was thrown into space at the ejection at the end, suggesting it’s the skeld
            Big brain
                Not really, it's pretty obvious
        Uh red gets thrown out of skeld?
        The space ejection is only in skeld
        Calibrate distributor is only on skeld
            Been told already
    **HOLD IT**

If so how could red have known the body is in electrical is blue didn’t specify?
        If you're looking at admin, you could see the body disappear from electrical. You could then end up in storage walking to the body to see if you pass by anyone along the way.
            Don't dead bodies stay on admin don't they?
                I'm not sure how admin works exactly. I've been told that if you're watching admin and a kill happens, the body count will flicker down and back.
                    off topic, but this reminds me of my friend's 2000IQ move. he was watching in admin, saw 3 of us were in electrical, and saw the 5th person move immediately between two places connected by a vent. called a meeting and asked which 3 of us were in electrical and convinced us to vote out the other.
            **OBJECTION**

Then why wouldn’t you report?
                If you're in admin walking to electrical to find the body but the report happened before you arrived at electrical, you would be in storage.

Of course, this still goes against the initial claim of "I was in storage doing a task"
                    **HOLD IT**

Yeah on Skeld. Not the same their maps.
It could be a map other then the spaceship
    Only map with the elecetric ring thing task
        That one really sucks but fair point, objection overruled
    It literally shows what map it is
And when did he specify what map it was on?! Lime is the impostor
    Once again, only map with a specified electric task
    At the end, when red gets ejected, it's not that hard.
Not on MIRA or Polus
    Mira and Polus don't have Calibrate Distributors, meaning it has to be The Skeld.

                                Oh, I think they do.
                                [removed]
                            Fine, but vote green next round.
                                Greens dead
                            This was very entertaining
                                That’s sus
                Can you even fake scan? I've gone there as the impostor and can't do it.
                    I think you used to be able to, but now you can't
                        Yeah, they patched it a long time ago. Imposter could get scan task and complete it
                        You can still turn off visual task confirms. But then if you wanna fake scan you gotta stand Riiight in the middle.
                            And do the little trot up onto it where it takes over and does a few steps.
                    Once I accused because I saw someone standing on the scanner but didn't see the scan. I thought for sure I was about to nail this imposter but like two other people saw it happen and were like 'bruh, you watched him scan'.

Then I got thrown out the airlock.
                        > Then I got thrown out the airlock.

Finally, some sweet justice.
                    What’s up with your book?
                    You just overlay while another scsns
                        Would that work with a ghost helping you?
                            Iirc ghosts don't have a visible scan ever
                                You could do it with the asteroid shooter. I know that it fires when a ghost does it. That’s how I found out someone was dead before anyone found the body. Poor red
                            I doubt it
                    No you can’t
                    Its kinda simple thanks to the task animation visibility toggle update no one can confirm you did or didn't actually scan unless they actually have scan and it doesn't show they're waiting in a queue for you to finish or someone watches the task bar like a hawk. And it's even more easy if there are two impostors. You can both just say you watched each other on the scan queue and as long as no one can tell for sure the rises on the task bar aren't from your scan tasks you can be clear of suspicion for a good minute or more unless your whole lobby is full of YOLO voters
            no its not yellow
            Yellow vented
            Black was ejected. 

“Guys I literally just said Black scanned, why did you vote him??”

“...”

You were ejected.

        "Wtf you idiots I told you blue scanned at the beginning of the game, y'all are fkn dumb"
        Why does the game always capitalize "An" snd "The"
            It looks more dramatic I guess
            Idk why but when I read it, in my mind I put more emphasis on "An" and "Imposter" because the first letters are capitalized.

        Damn the stars make it seem real
        Aight who suggested we vote blue? They are obviously the imposter
    That is the realistic version of this
*PTSD flashback to my first game*

I had no idea what I was doing, so I was wondering the ship, looking for my tasks, but then someone called an emergency meeting, told everyone to kick me because "Blue is sus" 

I didn't even have time to type before they voted me out and then the game suddenly said "imposter wins" even though there were like 8 other players left. 

I still need to learn how to play this thing.
    If the game suddenly says imposter wins with 8 players alive, that's a bug, or the host quit.
        hey guys,  


Blue is sus.
    That was my experience last night...
        >  didn't even have time to type before they voted me out

Yep, that was my experience. Decided it was not very fun. Might play again with family or friends down the line.

Ninja* Missed the word "not".
            I'd say definitely play with friends or family, it's much more fun than playing with strangers
            I've only played with friends in voice chat and it's wonderful, but I can't imagine trying to have a game typing with randos, wouldn't be a shred of fun.
Would have been funnier if it said "Red Was Not The Imposter"
    Would have been funnier if they ejected cyan
        It's not funny when my printer does it.
    I was thinking the same thing. When you're so sure someone is the imposter but it turns out they weren't.
*cyan
    thank you! i scrolled all the way down looking for this.
Watch him pull an updated autopsy report out of his ass
Voted blue. Who needs proof.


Sorry blue. Green.
Blue: “I’m dead”
Then everyone kicks dark blue instead of CYAN
Toast has entered the chat
Ikr, he shouldn’t be so critical, he could’ve blown his cover if he was imposter...
I hate it when that's their argument and everyone goes with it


Especially if you've done Every. Single. Task. So far, Because APPARENTLY drawing a line from one side to the other to fix wires is VERY COMPLICATED and SWIPING A CARD IS OF COURSE SOMETHING NO ONE ELSE COULD DO 

AAAANNNNNDDD.....
Red saw me scan in medical.

And Green was with me when the lights were out.
    Wait..but red was in storage..
        He was at some point, true. The scanning happened, like, a meeting and a half ago.
            That’s not true, I didn’t see you scan when I was watching you from the *vents* a bit ago.
                NANI?!

        Oh shit, is that why they do that? Never realized
            Naw its not but now they got the idea
                Trust me the idea has been out there for a while. That’s why people started having more intrusive watermarks like memetang or funwaa so they just slap some huge logo over someone else’s memes. 

Ebaumsworld was doing this pre-emoji so the practice has definitely been out for at least a decade.
                    [Friendly Ebaumsworld reminder.](https://youtu.be/BijChf8ROJU)
well surely i wouldnt do that, but red might
    kinda sus that you're blaming others without proof
I will ensure I give credit, also, you have a watermark on this, so It wouldn't be easy to steal anyway
Don't worry. This will absolutely be stolen and spread without credit.

It has a watermark that can't be cropped out, so you should be fine on that department.
I’ll share the link with my friends cause this was great lmao

        Hey, I saw (you) in vents
        I've started only speaking up if i'm positive who did it, then I say it's them, kick me after if not.  That seems to work >75% of the time.
        >be me

>he yells

>"not enough information".jpeg

>kills in front of me and everyone else

>report and call out

>get voted out 

>imposters win
            Sounds about right, and this was a game where I wasnt with randoms. I see the killer remove a guys head, report, and after telling the rest I just watched him do it, all it took for me to get vented (after doing visual tasks with other people) was "Bull shit, I saw you come out of the vent and kill him."

Then the imposters almost won because after ANOTHER person accused him of venting, these people nearly voted the guy who called the meeting.
Yeah I expected that too but it's already a bit of a stale punchline at this point, so I appreciated the purity of this.
I quit reporting bodies, I just run away from them if no one is with me to confirm I didn’t kill them. What sucks is when people see you fleeing from it and think you killed them. It’s very hard to win
    Well doesn't that make you lose more often?
        It depends. I’m still figuring out if I’m better off risking getting caught fleeing or getting “seems like a self report”-ed.
            Well it might make you more likely to die but also more likely to win.  IF no one reports then the Imposters have more time to make more kills and longer for the body to be cold
            you're better off risking the self report. If they don't believe you and vote you out, that's on them that they lost. if you run away and get caught, that's basically another free kill for the imposter, and if you lose, it's on you.
    Dont do that lol that just makes shit more confusing. You still win if teammates win even if u dead.

Top all time in the sub.
See you at top post of this entire sub
It's going to the TOP I'm telling you
i always use cyan, unless anyone else got it before i entered the room, and ive heard people say turquoise, light blue, baby blue, cyan, teal, and blue. Im like, can you all just say cyan

&#x200B;

edit: forgot teal
    and to any smartass going to type "no it's light blue", do this:

* pick whatever the f the thing's color is
* go to med scan and scan urself
* look at the your stats, you should find out ur age, blood type AND ESPECIALLY COLOR
    Never teal?
    That's a good strategy. People are less likely to talk about you if they don't know what to call you.
    i have seen 'aqua'
play with friends consistently and youll all be so good at the game you will have high IQ conversations like that
No you need to mash emergency meeting 10 seconds into the game and then randomly accuse anyone or even yourself.
    Had people do this in a recent game. I was the impostor and didn't kill anyone and they kept accusing each other and ejecting each other. I waited till there was three left, killed one, blamed one guy and I surprisingly got away with it. They killed each other of for me haha
        Today I had a fellow impostor call an emergency meeting and immediately say that they and me were the impostors... first time I was an impostor today and my ass was immediately ejected after.
            what an asshole
            Fuck that guy
I had to put the discussion timer up to like 90 seconds and voting to 30 seconds so people actually discuss but they just end up complaining
    Oh my God I wondered why people had huge discussion times. I will never leave again.
        What discussion time do you normally play with? The lobbies I join are always either 90 or 120, mostly 90 though.
            90
    I know i get full lobby but everybody leaves when they realize discussion time is 60s

Good thing its still fun with friends on discord
Ikr I've heard so much about this game, but when I finally tried my first round everyone just starting spamming blue is gay and then cyan got voted off.
    Dude I swear I don't know what the hell kinda lobbies you all playing on, this **never** happens to me
    Lol
This sub has actually some of the most high quality gaming content I’ve ever seen.
Ikr I was confused at first
    Why are your upvote downvote icons different
        I don’t see anything different, so I can’t help you.
            They're the imposter.
Little White must be so sad right now.
Honestly the amount of times i see this....
    Honestly when I see someone say that it makes me think imposter right away now haha
I thought stuff like that was just a meme, but someone actually was like “why is my name red???” I actually took a screenshot of it
    once i and someone else were imposter.
 they asked why are teal and mine names red.
    people say that shit in like every other match tho.
        Well I’ve never seen it outside of Reddit memes until then
    One time I said “This is only my second game. What does it mean when my names red” every one started throwing lols and explaining it. I wasn’t even the imposter. I was just doing it for shit and giggles. Then when they started dying each one asked why I lied lol.

The one these animations are based on? It's called Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney. I'd reccomend the Trilogy on 3DS/Steam/All current gen systems.
    Such an incredible game. Never played the other games although I own the trilogy on iPhone
    You can also get it on iOS if that boats your float.
Ace attorney series. 

The first game in the series is called phoenix wright ace attorney.

Ace attorney
Just have discussion time at like 60 seconds and voting at 15. Boom your problem is solved
    I do that, but nobody talks and we all just there waiting and everyone randomly votes. Not all the time but usually
It's from the Ace Attorney series, all of the trials took place in this court room. The animations that the crewmates do in this video reference specific characters form those games. Blue = Phoenix, Red = Edgeworth, etc.
It's Ace Attorney.

                    I love this comunity
I dressed up in the blue cop hat, blue pants, and blue pet dog, as purple.

I killed someone right in front of another guy.  He saw me do it.  He says "blue did it".

Someone else said "but blue is already dead"

"Oh then I don't know who"

The guy saw me murder right in front of him lol
    Pay to win!
        But it's all free
            The pants and pet?
                Yeah man, I don't know what the dollar sign is for cause i just click and have them all
                    I can use pants for free, I have to pay for pets tho
                        Mobile users have to pay for skins
    I always wear the suit and yellow hard hat as a red character so if I murderize someone and I’m barely seen above or below the wrong color will get reported
    Big ooof on his part lol
LOL that's a GG right there, bud.
Yellow must have been ready to give up on humanity after that

Edit for typo
    Nah she's fine. I apologized to her too (yellow was a friend and we were in vc, the other player was a rando)
That's something taken straight out of the Death Note
    Same level of asspull
I had a game the other night where we were down to final four, other imposter gone, tasks were nearly done. I was shitting myself, thinking how am I going to kill two more before task victory without being seen or sussed. On impulse I followed black after the meeting, like a buddy system. Black goes straight to security. We sit there on cams. I’m trying to decide what to do when suddenly a meeting is called. Ok, at least black saw me the whole time, I’ll have an ally at this meeting.

Wait a minute...pink is dead. They must have logged off. But the other two didn’t *see* them log off.

Relieved, black and I vote off the dangerous imposter yellow.

Black turns at the wet sound of my head unfolding...
I want to give yellow a hug :(
All you have to say is sus and whoever you are going against gets kicked out
I won one that I shouldn't have. Only had the time because one ghost didn't know to complete their tasks. But everyone was clumped on top of eachother (me included), so I just hit the kill button. No one could tell who did it. Managed to vote out some bystander. Then last kill was easy, hit the reactor follow them out there and as soon as the kill cooldown resets, get a kill before the emergency meeting cooldown resets.
How do you know what map he’s talking about?
    To be fair, distributor calibration is only on The Skeld
        what even is that lol
            [calibrate distributor](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmongUs/comments/ifmqwi/calibrate_distributor_task_is_a_pain_i_have_never/?utm_source=amp&utm_medium=&utm_content=post_num_comments)
                I've never ever had this task while playing. Am I just absurdly unlucky?
                    No, you're absurdly *lucky*

This task is a pain in the asscheeks, and you get killed easily while doing it
                        I don’t know how people think it’s a pain. It’s easy as fuck for me.
                            Same here but I get it almost every time I play so I’ve just memorized the speeds of each wheel
                            Wow, you must be a really talented gamer pro
                            yellow sus
                        Do people really have trouble with this task? Imo it's the second fastest electrical task after the divert power task.
                            What about wires, those are easy af
                        I don’t get why people are saying this is hard, this is a fast task if you just hit each button one after another since the circles often line themselves up
                            I’ve never had them line up properly for that
                        I thought it was quick and easy. Worst is meteors because they don't send them out fast enough, so even doing it perfectly takes awhile. Been killed during meteors soooo many times.
                        Distributor is fine, it's doing up/download in electrical that wracks my nerves.
                        Download task is far more annoying imo.

But I still don't know how to fix sabotaged Comms.
                        Simon says takes waay longer and flthe fuel task is more annoying.
                        Do y’all not have timing? You just click as soon as it connects.
                        really? ive always found all of the electrical tasks to be easy.
                    If anything you're absurdly *lucky*, calibrate distributor is so easy to get stuck on for ages
                    Me too! It took probably over 30 games before I got it. Now I get it a lot 😞.
                ah, i stand corrected.
    distributor calibration+the only map with “storage” as a common callout, at least among the group of people i play with. i’m looking at the map now and yeah I didn’t realize there were other places called storage on different maps, but ive heard that called closet and gas on mira and polus respectively
        those are probably named after the most common task you got to do in there. the watering can (part 1)  in mira hq and fuel engines or whatever on polus
    To be fair, red was thrown into space at the ejection at the end, suggesting it’s the skeld
        Big brain
            Not really, it's pretty obvious
    Uh red gets thrown out of skeld?
    The space ejection is only in skeld
    Calibrate distributor is only on skeld
        Been told already
**HOLD IT**

If so how could red have known the body is in electrical is blue didn’t specify?
    If you're looking at admin, you could see the body disappear from electrical. You could then end up in storage walking to the body to see if you pass by anyone along the way.
        Don't dead bodies stay on admin don't they?
            I'm not sure how admin works exactly. I've been told that if you're watching admin and a kill happens, the body count will flicker down and back.
                off topic, but this reminds me of my friend's 2000IQ move. he was watching in admin, saw 3 of us were in electrical, and saw the 5th person move immediately between two places connected by a vent. called a meeting and asked which 3 of us were in electrical and convinced us to vote out the other.
        **OBJECTION**

Then why wouldn’t you report?
            If you're in admin walking to electrical to find the body but the report happened before you arrived at electrical, you would be in storage.

Of course, this still goes against the initial claim of "I was in storage doing a task"
                **HOLD IT**

It literally shows what map it is
Once again, only map with a specified electric task
At the end, when red gets ejected, it's not that hard.
Mira and Polus don't have Calibrate Distributors, meaning it has to be The Skeld.

    Alright, I saw black scan, I think its yellow
        Black faked scan
            Little orange sus

                    I already voted skip
                        You have no idea how often this happens
                            Oh, I think they do.

                        Fine, but vote green next round.
                            Greens dead
                        This was very entertaining
                            That’s sus
            Can you even fake scan? I've gone there as the impostor and can't do it.
                I think you used to be able to, but now you can't
                    Yeah, they patched it a long time ago. Imposter could get scan task and complete it
                    You can still turn off visual task confirms. But then if you wanna fake scan you gotta stand Riiight in the middle.
                        And do the little trot up onto it where it takes over and does a few steps.
                Once I accused because I saw someone standing on the scanner but didn't see the scan. I thought for sure I was about to nail this imposter but like two other people saw it happen and were like 'bruh, you watched him scan'.

Then I got thrown out the airlock.
                    > Then I got thrown out the airlock.

Finally, some sweet justice.
                What’s up with your book?
                You just overlay while another scsns
                    Would that work with a ghost helping you?
                        Iirc ghosts don't have a visible scan ever
                            You could do it with the asteroid shooter. I know that it fires when a ghost does it. That’s how I found out someone was dead before anyone found the body. Poor red
                        I doubt it
                No you can’t
                Its kinda simple thanks to the task animation visibility toggle update no one can confirm you did or didn't actually scan unless they actually have scan and it doesn't show they're waiting in a queue for you to finish or someone watches the task bar like a hawk. And it's even more easy if there are two impostors. You can both just say you watched each other on the scan queue and as long as no one can tell for sure the rises on the task bar aren't from your scan tasks you can be clear of suspicion for a good minute or more unless your whole lobby is full of YOLO voters
        no its not yellow
        Yellow vented
        Black was ejected. 

“Guys I literally just said Black scanned, why did you vote him??”

“...”

You were ejected.

    "Wtf you idiots I told you blue scanned at the beginning of the game, y'all are fkn dumb"
    Why does the game always capitalize "An" snd "The"
        It looks more dramatic I guess
        Idk why but when I read it, in my mind I put more emphasis on "An" and "Imposter" because the first letters are capitalized.

    Damn the stars make it seem real
    Aight who suggested we vote blue? They are obviously the imposter
That is the realistic version of this
If the game suddenly says imposter wins with 8 players alive, that's a bug, or the host quit.
    hey guys,  


Blue is sus.
That was my experience last night...
    >  didn't even have time to type before they voted me out

Yep, that was my experience. Decided it was not very fun. Might play again with family or friends down the line.

Ninja* Missed the word "not".
        I'd say definitely play with friends or family, it's much more fun than playing with strangers
        I've only played with friends in voice chat and it's wonderful, but I can't imagine trying to have a game typing with randos, wouldn't be a shred of fun.
Would have been funnier if they ejected cyan
    It's not funny when my printer does it.
I was thinking the same thing. When you're so sure someone is the imposter but it turns out they weren't.
thank you! i scrolled all the way down looking for this.
Wait..but red was in storage..
    He was at some point, true. The scanning happened, like, a meeting and a half ago.
        That’s not true, I didn’t see you scan when I was watching you from the *vents* a bit ago.
            NANI?!

    Oh shit, is that why they do that? Never realized
        Naw its not but now they got the idea
            Trust me the idea has been out there for a while. That’s why people started having more intrusive watermarks like memetang or funwaa so they just slap some huge logo over someone else’s memes. 

Ebaumsworld was doing this pre-emoji so the practice has definitely been out for at least a decade.

kinda sus that you're blaming others without proof

\>report what i saw

\>get vented

rinse and repeat
    Crewmates that play 2nd and 3rd imposter are to blame for that.
        1 imposter maps master race
    Hey, I saw (you) in vents
    I've started only speaking up if i'm positive who did it, then I say it's them, kick me after if not.  That seems to work >75% of the time.
    >be me

>last imposter jumps out of vent in front of me

>press button while they chase me

>he yells

>"not enough information".jpeg

>kills in front of me and everyone else

>report and call out

>get voted out 

>imposters win
        Sounds about right, and this was a game where I wasnt with randoms. I see the killer remove a guys head, report, and after telling the rest I just watched him do it, all it took for me to get vented (after doing visual tasks with other people) was "Bull shit, I saw you come out of the vent and kill him."

Then the imposters almost won because after ANOTHER person accused him of venting, these people nearly voted the guy who called the meeting.
Well doesn't that make you lose more often?
    It depends. I’m still figuring out if I’m better off risking getting caught fleeing or getting “seems like a self report”-ed.
        Well it might make you more likely to die but also more likely to win.  IF no one reports then the Imposters have more time to make more kills and longer for the body to be cold
        you're better off risking the self report. If they don't believe you and vote you out, that's on them that they lost. if you run away and get caught, that's basically another free kill for the imposter, and if you lose, it's on you.
Dont do that lol that just makes shit more confusing. You still win if teammates win even if u dead.

        This is actually hilarious. Thank you for that.
it’s in r/all now
and to any smartass going to type "no it's light blue", do this:

* pick whatever the f the thing's color is
* go to med scan and scan urself
* look at the your stats, you should find out ur age, blood type AND ESPECIALLY COLOR
Never teal?
That's a good strategy. People are less likely to talk about you if they don't know what to call you.
i have seen 'aqua'
Had people do this in a recent game. I was the impostor and didn't kill anyone and they kept accusing each other and ejecting each other. I waited till there was three left, killed one, blamed one guy and I surprisingly got away with it. They killed each other of for me haha
    Today I had a fellow impostor call an emergency meeting and immediately say that they and me were the impostors... first time I was an impostor today and my ass was immediately ejected after.
        what an asshole
        Fuck that guy
Oh my God I wondered why people had huge discussion times. I will never leave again.
    What discussion time do you normally play with? The lobbies I join are always either 90 or 120, mostly 90 though.
        90
I know i get full lobby but everybody leaves when they realize discussion time is 60s

Good thing its still fun with friends on discord
Dude I swear I don't know what the hell kinda lobbies you all playing on, this **never** happens to me
Lol
Why are your upvote downvote icons different
    I don’t see anything different, so I can’t help you.
        They're the imposter.
Honestly when I see someone say that it makes me think imposter right away now haha
once i and someone else were imposter.
 they asked why are teal and mine names red.
people say that shit in like every other match tho.
    Well I’ve never seen it outside of Reddit memes until then
One time I said “This is only my second game. What does it mean when my names red” every one started throwing lols and explaining it. I wasn’t even the imposter. I was just doing it for shit and giggles. Then when they started dying each one asked why I lied lol.

                        yellow sus
                    Do people really have trouble with this task? Imo it's the second fastest electrical task after the divert power task.
                        What about wires, those are easy af
                    I don’t get why people are saying this is hard, this is a fast task if you just hit each button one after another since the circles often line themselves up
                        I’ve never had them line up properly for that
                    I thought it was quick and easy. Worst is meteors because they don't send them out fast enough, so even doing it perfectly takes awhile. Been killed during meteors soooo many times.
                    Distributor is fine, it's doing up/download in electrical that wracks my nerves.
                    Download task is far more annoying imo.

But I still don't know how to fix sabotaged Comms.
                    Simon says takes waay longer and flthe fuel task is more annoying.
                    Do y’all not have timing? You just click as soon as it connects.
                    really? ive always found all of the electrical tasks to be easy.
                If anything you're absurdly *lucky*, calibrate distributor is so easy to get stuck on for ages
                Me too! It took probably over 30 games before I got it. Now I get it a lot 😞.
            ah, i stand corrected.
distributor calibration+the only map with “storage” as a common callout, at least among the group of people i play with. i’m looking at the map now and yeah I didn’t realize there were other places called storage on different maps, but ive heard that called closet and gas on mira and polus respectively
    those are probably named after the most common task you got to do in there. the watering can (part 1)  in mira hq and fuel engines or whatever on polus
To be fair, red was thrown into space at the ejection at the end, suggesting it’s the skeld
    Big brain
        Not really, it's pretty obvious
Uh red gets thrown out of skeld?
The space ejection is only in skeld
Calibrate distributor is only on skeld
    Been told already
If you're looking at admin, you could see the body disappear from electrical. You could then end up in storage walking to the body to see if you pass by anyone along the way.
    Don't dead bodies stay on admin don't they?
        I'm not sure how admin works exactly. I've been told that if you're watching admin and a kill happens, the body count will flicker down and back.
            off topic, but this reminds me of my friend's 2000IQ move. he was watching in admin, saw 3 of us were in electrical, and saw the 5th person move immediately between two places connected by a vent. called a meeting and asked which 3 of us were in electrical and convinced us to vote out the other.
    **OBJECTION**

Then why wouldn’t you report?
        If you're in admin walking to electrical to find the body but the report happened before you arrived at electrical, you would be in storage.

Of course, this still goes against the initial claim of "I was in storage doing a task"
            **HOLD IT**

        Can you even fake scan? I've gone there as the impostor and can't do it.
            I think you used to be able to, but now you can't
                Yeah, they patched it a long time ago. Imposter could get scan task and complete it
                You can still turn off visual task confirms. But then if you wanna fake scan you gotta stand Riiight in the middle.
                    And do the little trot up onto it where it takes over and does a few steps.
            Once I accused because I saw someone standing on the scanner but didn't see the scan. I thought for sure I was about to nail this imposter but like two other people saw it happen and were like 'bruh, you watched him scan'.

Then I got thrown out the airlock.

                        You could do it with the asteroid shooter. I know that it fires when a ghost does it. That’s how I found out someone was dead before anyone found the body. Poor red
                    I doubt it
            No you can’t
            Its kinda simple thanks to the task animation visibility toggle update no one can confirm you did or didn't actually scan unless they actually have scan and it doesn't show they're waiting in a queue for you to finish or someone watches the task bar like a hawk. And it's even more easy if there are two impostors. You can both just say you watched each other on the scan queue and as long as no one can tell for sure the rises on the task bar aren't from your scan tasks you can be clear of suspicion for a good minute or more unless your whole lobby is full of YOLO voters
    no its not yellow

    Black was ejected. 

“Guys I literally just said Black scanned, why did you vote him??”

“...”

"Wtf you idiots I told you blue scanned at the beginning of the game, y'all are fkn dumb"
Why does the game always capitalize "An" snd "The"
    It looks more dramatic I guess
    Idk why but when I read it, in my mind I put more emphasis on "An" and "Imposter" because the first letters are capitalized.

Aight who suggested we vote blue? They are obviously the imposter
hey guys,  


Blue is sus.
>  didn't even have time to type before they voted me out

Yep, that was my experience. Decided it was not very fun. Might play again with family or friends down the line.

Ninja* Missed the word "not".
    I'd say definitely play with friends or family, it's much more fun than playing with strangers
    I've only played with friends in voice chat and it's wonderful, but I can't imagine trying to have a game typing with randos, wouldn't be a shred of fun.
It's not funny when my printer does it.
He was at some point, true. The scanning happened, like, a meeting and a half ago.
    That’s not true, I didn’t see you scan when I was watching you from the *vents* a bit ago.

Oh shit, is that why they do that? Never realized
    Naw its not but now they got the idea
        Trust me the idea has been out there for a while. That’s why people started having more intrusive watermarks like memetang or funwaa so they just slap some huge logo over someone else’s memes. 

Ebaumsworld was doing this pre-emoji so the practice has definitely been out for at least a decade.

Hey, I saw (you) in vents
I've started only speaking up if i'm positive who did it, then I say it's them, kick me after if not.  That seems to work >75% of the time.
>be me

>last imposter jumps out of vent in front of me

>press button while they chase me

>he yells

>"not enough information".jpeg

>kills in front of me and everyone else

>report and call out

>get voted out 

>imposters win
    Sounds about right, and this was a game where I wasnt with randoms. I see the killer remove a guys head, report, and after telling the rest I just watched him do it, all it took for me to get vented (after doing visual tasks with other people) was "Bull shit, I saw you come out of the vent and kill him."

Then the imposters almost won because after ANOTHER person accused him of venting, these people nearly voted the guy who called the meeting.
It depends. I’m still figuring out if I’m better off risking getting caught fleeing or getting “seems like a self report”-ed.
    Well it might make you more likely to die but also more likely to win.  IF no one reports then the Imposters have more time to make more kills and longer for the body to be cold
    you're better off risking the self report. If they don't believe you and vote you out, that's on them that they lost. if you run away and get caught, that's basically another free kill for the imposter, and if you lose, it's on you.

    This is actually hilarious. Thank you for that.

I'm not sure how admin works exactly. I've been told that if you're watching admin and a kill happens, the body count will flicker down and back.
    off topic, but this reminds me of my friend's 2000IQ move. he was watching in admin, saw 3 of us were in electrical, and saw the 5th person move immediately between two places connected by a vent. called a meeting and asked which 3 of us were in electrical and convinced us to vote out the other.
If you're in admin walking to electrical to find the body but the report happened before you arrived at electrical, you would be in storage.

Of course, this still goes against the initial claim of "I was in storage doing a task"

            You have no idea how often this happens
                Oh, I think they do.

            Fine, but vote green next round.

            This was very entertaining
                That’s sus
Can you even fake scan? I've gone there as the impostor and can't do it.
    I think you used to be able to, but now you can't
        Yeah, they patched it a long time ago. Imposter could get scan task and complete it
        You can still turn off visual task confirms. But then if you wanna fake scan you gotta stand Riiight in the middle.
            And do the little trot up onto it where it takes over and does a few steps.
    Once I accused because I saw someone standing on the scanner but didn't see the scan. I thought for sure I was about to nail this imposter but like two other people saw it happen and were like 'bruh, you watched him scan'.

Then I got thrown out the airlock.
        > Then I got thrown out the airlock.

Finally, some sweet justice.
    What’s up with your book?
    You just overlay while another scsns
        Would that work with a ghost helping you?
            Iirc ghosts don't have a visible scan ever
                You could do it with the asteroid shooter. I know that it fires when a ghost does it. That’s how I found out someone was dead before anyone found the body. Poor red
            I doubt it
    No you can’t
    Its kinda simple thanks to the task animation visibility toggle update no one can confirm you did or didn't actually scan unless they actually have scan and it doesn't show they're waiting in a queue for you to finish or someone watches the task bar like a hawk. And it's even more easy if there are two impostors. You can both just say you watched each other on the scan queue and as long as no one can tell for sure the rises on the task bar aren't from your scan tasks you can be clear of suspicion for a good minute or more unless your whole lobby is full of YOLO voters

            FUCK
    🤣🤣man I just wanna be loved🤣🤣
Trust me the idea has been out there for a while. That’s why people started having more intrusive watermarks like memetang or funwaa so they just slap some huge logo over someone else’s memes. 

Ebaumsworld was doing this pre-emoji so the practice has definitely been out for at least a decade.

    I love this comunity
Yeah man, I don't know what the dollar sign is for cause i just click and have them all
    I can use pants for free, I have to pay for pets tho
        Mobile users have to pay for skins
I've never ever had this task while playing. Am I just absurdly unlucky?
    No, you're absurdly *lucky*

This task is a pain in the asscheeks, and you get killed easily while doing it
        I don’t know how people think it’s a pain. It’s easy as fuck for me.
            Same here but I get it almost every time I play so I’ve just memorized the speeds of each wheel
            Wow, you must be a really talented gamer pro
            yellow sus
        Do people really have trouble with this task? Imo it's the second fastest electrical task after the divert power task.
            What about wires, those are easy af
        I don’t get why people are saying this is hard, this is a fast task if you just hit each button one after another since the circles often line themselves up
            I’ve never had them line up properly for that
        I thought it was quick and easy. Worst is meteors because they don't send them out fast enough, so even doing it perfectly takes awhile. Been killed during meteors soooo many times.
        Distributor is fine, it's doing up/download in electrical that wracks my nerves.
        Download task is far more annoying imo.

But I still don't know how to fix sabotaged Comms.
        Simon says takes waay longer and flthe fuel task is more annoying.
        Do y’all not have timing? You just click as soon as it connects.
        really? ive always found all of the electrical tasks to be easy.
    If anything you're absurdly *lucky*, calibrate distributor is so easy to get stuck on for ages
    Me too! It took probably over 30 games before I got it. Now I get it a lot 😞.
