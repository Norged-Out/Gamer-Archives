[[I am once again asking you to let others enjoy the game]]





Always happens. 

The best part is when we all vote them out and kick them.
    Still ruins the game if you vote him out as the game would have also ended if they let you win by killing everyone
        People have started doing this, and lying, just to ruin the game.

Just this morning, I was one of two impostors. I killed blue first, and lime starts spewing out “I’m friends with blue and he told me black did it!!!!” even though black was definitely not an impostor. 

We voted out lime and he left after cussing up a storm and telling us to kill ourselves, but the game was still ruined because people still suspected black based on lime’s baseless accusation. Combined with the standard 1-2 people leaving as soon as the game starts, by the end it was just too easy of a win and not fun at all for anyone.

After the game, blue said that he had no idea who lime was, so that idiot was literally just there to ruin other people’s fun. Fucking douchebag.

                From what I understand the dev is working on an account system exactly so they can ban people like that.
                    Idk how it isn’t a thing already. I get this has been a smaller game for the past couple years and there was probably just a code of honor in place, but I’ve played enough Gmod to know how much of a problem meta gaming and ghosting can be.
                        You don't always foresee these type of issues..
                            You shouldn't have to plan around the lowest common denominator...but we do.

If people can fuck something up, there's some asshole out there willing to try
                            Happy cake day
                        they were intending the game for groups of friends mostly. who may even be on a couch together. and the online play was a bit of an afterthought, afaik. so they never thought that would be such a problem
                Petition for this bruh! Where should I sign
            The innersloth official discord has rooms for among us, negating this problem
            The worst part is the fact he tried to tell your group to kill themselves. That messed up and it should be a crime
                It actually is, at least where I’m from
                    Welp now we have a reason to arrest that douchebag
            if he was imposter it would have been alright ,but he wasnt
        That’s when everyone needs to be on the same page. Continue playing without voting anyone off and without reporting bodies. Everyone tries to finish their tasks without getting killed
            Still ruined.

                    bruh
                        I'll skate to the beach! And I'll look better gettin' there.
                    Angel Dust was a sick album!
                    Is that supposed to be a dollar store version of a rickroll
                        HAHAHA!
                    Lmao when the drummer starts playing the lead singer.
                Like with spoilers in Twitch chat you all have to pre-emptively and continuously spam the chat with false accusations to drown out the real ones. Only option.
                    I hate twitch.

I also like twitch.
                        No one likes Twitch. It's a terrible blight. 

Anyways, gotta go. My Twitch stream starts in 5 minutes!
                    Most streamers I watch play the game turn their chats on emote only when they are playing and they go back to regular text chats when they are in the lobbies
                    *Laughs in emote only
                Username sounds very familiar...


...János.
                Not necessarily. Just turn it into Alien vs Crewmate.
(Hide and Seek, https://youtu.be/abYgE5TdOm0)
                Not ruined if u turn it into hide and seek
            Whats even the point then
                It keeps the game going without completely ruining it for the poor bastard that finally got imposter after probably waiting over an hour
                    But why continue. All the fun of the game is lost even if it is a shame that the imposter was revealed by a cheat
                        Because then it becomes a different game. Plenty of folks play variations like this anyway.
                            Yes but the entire premise is to find the imposter and everyone knows who the imposter is then why would you play? It's not gonna be hard for the imposter to just kill everyone if they deliberately don't vote him off. Just end the match, kick the cheat and move on to the next one lmfao
                                It turns into hide and seek which is actually pretty fun. The entire point is knowing the seeker/imposter and avoiding them while doing tasks at the same time. It kinda becomes dead by daylight in a way.
                                    Would be good to have a "hide-and-seek" voting option down next to skip.  When this sort of thing happens and a majority vote hide-and-seek the game changes modes, reduces vision and increases movement speed for crewmates (and the inverse for imposter), reduces kill timer, disables the emergency button and reporting, and away you go.
                                    I applaud the duck out of you guys who don’t let a cheater ruin your gaming experience.
                                The premise is to NOT BE KILLED, not to find the imposter.  That is why you can easily win games (if everyone isn’t a dumbass) by doing your tasks.  

The objective is to live and get your team out of that area, not to necessarily find the imposter.
                                    EvErYoNe WhO dOeSn'T PlAy LiKe I dO iS a DuMbAsS....

The objective is to have fun, it's a game.  Winning easily isn't always the route one would want to take.  Others disagree.
                                No the point is to get all the tasks done or eject the imposter.
                        I wouldn’t say it’s lost. It can still be fun that way considering it’ll become more of a hide & seek from that point forward. It sucks that it was ruined, but that’s an easy way to salvage the game
        Happened to me once and they didn't wanted to vote me cuz felt bad :((( 

Still made them vote me so we can play another one
        I had a really fun game where I was imposter. Other imposter got caught and named me before he was voted off. Everyone understood, and just pretended they didn’t know. 
It got really obvious near the end I was just killing whoever and everyone was ignoring the bodies.
            That’s so fucked. Sorry that game was ruined.
                But that’s the thing, we didn’t let them ruin the game. We just had fun with it.
        You're supposed to mute your mic between meetings. Playing like they are is ruining the game.
    I try to defend the accused. I just massively doubt them. Often I get voted out as well, even if not the impostor, but I try to put it back on them. Nobody can corroborate that they were actually in Discord with that person. Why should we trust that statement?

What if Purple was the impostor blaming Cyan for their kill? What if confirms are off? Youd never know.
        your good for that dude
        Precisely why I like playing with confirm off. The stakes are much higher not having any real argument.
            I wont because I'm not a dick, but I want to start faking being in Discord with someone. I mostly play solo. So I join a game with confirms off. When I'm impostor, just be like [dead color] told me [alive color] did it. We are in Discord. I'd be flat out lying, but everyone just believes that shit. I'm so tempted to try it.
                I would say to only use it after someone else has said it.  
  
"Red told me Yellow killed him through Discord!"

"What are you talking about? Red just told me it was you who killed him, how could you lie about that!"
                    That's a good one!
                    Ooh, I like it.  Countering with their own shit.  Might buy some time, and even if the metagaming guy was crew and correct that yellow was imposter he deserves to get spaced anyway for metagaming
                May as well. Not like most random lobbies have players with an attention span longer than 15 seconds with confirm on. “White was not an imposter “ - “welp, guess we’ll just forget red fully lied about seeing him kill yellow.”

Win so many games as imposter that way.
                    That just leads to "vote them and if not vote me" argument which is also stupid. Suiciding as an impostor is great if there are multiples. 

Imagine there are 2 impostors. You get caught in a kill and get a crewmember vented before you and you just took out at least 2 people. That leaves the other impostor 6v1, which isnt great, but not bad given how quickly some other random impostors get murdered.

Now imagine you take out before you suicide vent, your teammate and you take out 4 people. Then plus the vented crewmember you used "vote them and if not vote me" on, your lone teammate is at a 1v4. I really like those odds if I'm the lone impostor.
                        That’s why I just do “I saw them kill x right in front of me.” Just as soon as the chat box comes up. With 2 imposters and no confirm I can make it work at least twice.

But I used the “saw them kill right in front of me” tactic 9v1 with confirm on and the one guy who stuck around too call a meeting after ejecting an innocent was the next victim. Next meeting was down to 3 and there was no accusation even leveled resulting in a skip vote. Had the other two remembered 5 minutes prior I would have lost.
                            I was 1v3 and got seen killing. Blamed the other guy, saying "if not him then vote me next." 1v2, I'm hoping I can get the last kill before they can call the meeting. Right after, I check the meeting cooldown, it's 3 seconds shorter than my kill cooldown. Crap, I just lost. Except the 2 dumbasses immediately run off to do missions. Okay, I'll wait by the button and sabotage 02. As soon as they clear the emergency, I duck down to admin for the win.  
Like come on.. See the bigger picture. You know I'm the only imposter and I only need one more kill. If you call the meeting, you win. If my cooldown is shorter, you lose. If you don't hit the #@&$ button, you lose!
                Yea people get all on about honor and stuff in this game trying to play it like fucking sherlock holmes. Nah go full puppet master, just claim people are faking tasks, say "vote me out if I'm wrong" then next time around self report and urgently blame someone else.
                i did somthing similar once by fake ratting out the other imposter ,of sadly the innocent who i blamed got really mad and i got kicked after the game
                I play like this tbh, and it's pretty effective. I haven't tried the "I'm in discord, it's him" claim yet, but I'm definitely going too now. The big one I like doing is fake snitching on my other impostor when I'm blatantly busted. Like 2 people see me kill on cams, so I know I'm going out the airlock, but I'll fake being salty about it, pick a quiet crew member, claim they're an idiot and not helping me, and say to eject them too. %60 of the time it works every time, especially if my real other impostor isn't sus and piles on.

EDIT: You shouldn't even feel like a dick playing like this either. The point of being impostor is to mess with crew to throw sus off you, and anything goes that way. Lying about being in discord with a dead guy isn't any different then lying about not killing them in the first place.
                What I can tell you is after seeing a bunch of butthurt imposters get caught call out the other imposters in chat before they get ejected, I've started doing the same.

Except I call out some random innocent guy, and so far 100% of the time that guy will get immediately ejected. I feel bad about it but was hoping to spread doubt in the community of just believing these dickheads. 

So go for it. They will absolutely eject them without a second thought because most people are idiots.
        Chaotic good
        One startegy I do is "*killed person* is my friend, I'm in a discord call with them, they told me it's *random person I decide to accuse*".

Doesn't really work because I play with a group of friends over discord, but it's the thought that counts.
            This was my idea and I play as a solo. I'd feel bad about "ruining" a game, even though I'm just fake ruining it. But I want to see how many times everyone would believe me lol
                Exact same problem here. I only do it as a joke among my friends because I'm too scared to do it in a public lobby
                Yeah I've been tempted to pull that in a public lobby myself, but it just ends up feeling *wrong* to me and stop before going through with it
    Except when they aren't stupid enough to tell them they are cheating. Like this guy yesterday who said I killed and vented in front of him when I closed both doors and double checked there wasn't anyone in those rooms. So I confessed being the impostor after everyone voted but the guy is talking with the dead because he had no way to see me kill or vent but they didn't believe me :c
        This happened to me yesterday.  I killed someone in electric and vented to medbay immediately as noone walked into either room. Literally like 3 seconds later someone called a meeting and said they saw me kill and vent from electric. There is no way they would've gotten from electric to the cafeteria at the same as me venting to medbay, unless they were lying and already in the cafe, but of course randoms vote quick as hell without hearing reasoning or defenses so I was ejected.
            The vent animation shows up even if you don't have direct line of sight to the vent. If you are standing in security you can see the vents in both electrical and medbay. With that it's pretty easy to run by and see who is leaving the room that was vented to.

You can also see the vent in electrical from the behind the first wall in electrical. If you know who was on the other side before seeing the vent animation then you know who the imposter is.
                Notice how it took longer than 3 seconds to get to the button. The point im trying to make is none of the things that everyone is saying explains the speed in which he called the meeting so fast that you cant even make a move after getting out of the vent. Its not like I hovered in the vent either. I went in and out of the vent immediately after killing.
            Lets say I'm getting gas to refuel the engines, and I see you walk into electrical. I decide to stop by electrical to do wires on my way to the engine, but you're not there, and there's a dead body. I didn't see you come out, so the only logical assumption is that you killed them and fled the scene through a vent.

You don't have to directly witness something to figure out what happened.
                To be fair, he did say that he called a meeting, as opposed to reporting the body, and said he was in the cafe (which confirms that).  There is still one viable possibility, though, without knowing more details:  Maybe he was watching Admin, and saw a user disappear from electric, at the same time one appeared in MedBay  (i.e. "saw you vent"), and when he went towards cafe to confirm, saw you coming from MedBay?  I've heard there's a way to "see" kills on admin (the icon flickers or something?)
                    I do this, admin is incredibly useful when people are randomly wandering around to see if it was a self report by the killer, 2 blips, 1 blip and a report and you know they just self reported.
                        Dead bodies still show up in admin on Skeld though, right? So how does this help?
                            If there are only 2 blips and its reported the one that reported had to be the one that did it if nothing else has moved since.
                                Yeah what I’m saying is you would have to sit and wait for a while. A dead body and someone who has three tasks in electrical look very similar unless you just sit at admin. Even then, someone walking in after and reporting would fit your criteria as it would appear as if two people were in there when they walked into a room with a dead body. 

This is assuming I am right about bodies appearing on admin map, which I’m fairly sure is right.
                                    He reported right when I popped out of the vent so it was in the span of like 3 seconds
        I was an imposter but hadn't killed anyone yet. I was on the opposite side of the map when a crewmate was killed and someone (not other imposter) starts telling everyone they saw *me* do it. I was so pissed they voted for me because they felt vindicated, but they were fucking wrong.
            I hate it when this happens
            I was in a game where after a dead body was found and it turned out to be the 2nd body, they were all, "This imposter seems far more competent. Vote Tathas out."  

I mean, it was me, but nobody had any actual proof.
                Only thing to do is haunt their asses
        Yeah this has happened to me before, I always called them out for cheating. Sadly no one cares
    I got stuck with one group where all of them were on discord. I told them why not set the game to private then? And they kicked me and I wasnt even the imp.
        Their dicks
            What about their dicks?
                They are small
        Sounds like my "friend" group. Stopped playing with them right away
    This is why I host games myself. If someone says they are on discord with their buddy I ask who their buddy is and I kick them both. I don't like being THAT guy but it's just not fair on anyone else. 

I mean if you want to play with your buddies on discord host a game and discord or join a game with a discord but when it's just you and your buddy with randoms it gives you an unfair advantage as both the imposter and as a crew mate.
        I'd love being that guy. Fuck em
        I’m always on discord with my friends. We don’t cheat or tell who killed us. Kicking people just because they are on discord is dumb. Everyone using discord doesn’t cheat. We want to play the game and removing any challenge from the game removes the fun.
            I play on Discord with my friends, but I dislike it for public matches. Even if the Discord group isn't cheating, they seldom talk to the rest of the players. I was in a game where half the players voted for one guy with no discussion. When I asked, they told me they were in Discord. So it's a crappy thing to do if you aren't communicating with the players who are not in your Discord.
                We use the in game chat as well.
                    This is how my friends play in public as well, I make sure my friends are typing in chat what we're saying in voice.
                        [deleted]
                            We use an xbox chat cuz we don't all have discord but it's because there's only 2-4 of us, too small for a game. We have a code of honor though where we only speak during discussion rounds and make sure to type in the chat the things we suspect.
                                Pretty much the same for us but we talk the whole time about non game related stuff and talk game stuff during votes. No reason to stay silent might as well have a convo.
                That literally just happened to me. Nobody said anything and all of a sudden everyone voted me.
            Maybe you and your buddy play like that but i don't know if you have some sort of honour system or a cheating system going on.

Literally the only time anyone ever mentions being on discord in among us is to inform who the imposter was by speaking to their buddy. If you don't do that then I'll never know you are on discord and you wont ket kicked.
    if it happens in a lobby i'm in, i just say "vote kick them out of the game for cheating, and their friend"
    I have still yet to see that happen
    Ban em. I kicked one and they came right back. Didn't notice until the game started again. Now I just ban one of them.
    Public lobbies are messed up
    Or when everyone is on discord but you and start voting without saying anything.
    𝘌𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘺𝘰𝘯𝘦 𝘭𝘪𝘬𝘦𝘥 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵
    Stop Playing public lobbies and join official discord’s, game is so much more enjoyable
        Some people dont have friends or are too shy to join a discord
People who cheat with discord have a special place in hell, followed closely by people who won’t kick them and just want an easy win
    There was a brother and sister I presume who made a lobby themselves to cheat and I’m like wtf?

Called them bitches and left
        As is the standard practice, of course.
            I've had this a lot...
            Yes
        I played with people like that and when they claimed I killed their sister I just said he was simping and trying to cover the fact that he is imposter
            Lmao
            I had a husband-wife playing that were cool until one was imp and the other wasn’t. Came down to the 3 of us, with wife killing #4 in front of us. Husband covers for her anyway. So not cool.
        Damn, was that my kids (8 and 10)? I gave them an earful after realizing what was going on.
            Damn, I wish my parents played video games with me when I was younger.
            Idk tbh

It was a random game and hey were blue and white
        dayum.
        Hate when people do that, I make lobby’s with my sister, but we ignore each other except for when we can use the chat and talk to everyone and never say anything we shouldn’t
        My wife and I play in the same room, the second the match starts to when it’s over we are silent. I don’t get why people cheat on this game
        Lol they’re probably kids or something why are you calling them bitches

Like I get leaving once you realize what’s going on but you don’t have to be a dick too. If anything just send a message that says “please don’t cheat” or something like that

Edit: my point is you can call them out without being a total asshole about it lmao maybe talk to them before “calling them bitches and leaving” bc that accomplishes literally nothing
            >  If anything just send a message that says “please don’t cheat” or something like that

Is this your first online game or what
                I’m just saying you can approach it without being a dick
                [https://youtu.be/wTuhMUja7us](https://youtu.be/wTuhMUja7us)
            We makes mistakes in the heat of ANGER Jimbo
            Yeah saying please don’t cheat is so helpful
            If they’re such little pussies that they can actively ruin peoples fun but can’t take getting called a bitch because of it then they can get off the computer and go hop on the youtube kids app on their ipad and watch some metrosexual weirdo with purple hair play the game completely curse free.
                Sounds like you’re having a heated gamer moment
                    im gonna say it
                        the gamer word
                            MRS OBAMA, GET DOWN
            This entire subreddit is 15 year olds 

You’re talking to a child
                This implies we're all children now

I'm afraid
                    This is terrible news for my spouse.
            Kids need to learn that cheating is bad and wrong. We need a newer, stronger word for cheating in among us.
            [removed]
        So my SO and I play together. If 1 of us is the imposter we let each other know. The other doesnt add anything to the chat and doesnt defend themselves or the imp.

If we are both crewmates. We identify that and go about our mission. If one of us gets killed you might hear "gosh darn saggy balls" "u ded?" "...ya" and dont identify the killer.

Still fun and able to connect with my SO fairly.
        I had this happen with cousins
            That’s fucking hot bro
    [deleted]
        And then they’ll be back at it next game. Really don’t understand the hesitation in kicking.
    I use discord for civil talk when in Pubs, I don't cheat, we just use it as faster forms of communication while telling the people not in our call what we think. Again, we don't say who killed each other. Is that ok?
        This has been the norm for years.  In games where info is important and have a separate dead chat, if you get killed you don't talk about how on outside comms, or at least until everyone is dead or end of round.
        Yes Mr. Cake man
        Yeah honestly, I play it where I often have 5 friends in discord then fill with random, but we don't cheat. If important info gets relayed in discord we post it in the chat too and also if any of us dies we don't say anything in discord, like its supposed to be.

Though I suppose it wouldn't make much sense for a 5 person discord to cheat because we mostly want to play against each other and that would spoil it for everyone.
        I dunno. The odds of you being able to type out all of the info you said out loud is unlikely.

But it's not as bad as people who do this, *don't* type anything, and then just vote without a word.
        Why? That’s just redundant
    The game doesn't even track stats. There's no point to padding your win loss. Just have fun, jeez.
        Technically it does track stats but not publicly, so there are no bragging rights included.
            Well if the stats aren't public who cares? It's a black box, if nobody can see em there's no reason to think about them
    people who cheat-cheat (double kills, insta vote, skip vote, etc) must have an extra special place then.
    Amen
    Cheating in among us makes no sense. At least in other games with experience or a battle pass there is a tangible benefit. 

This has no value other than being a dick.

    So far I've only played with friends in discord and the only time we've ever done anything like this was when it was obvious that an imposter and crewmate were working together (An example, I was killed, I didn't say anything to my team until I saw my killer kill someone else right in front of a confirmed crewmate then hop into a vent, then the confirmed crewmate claimed that he was with him and didn't kill anyone. )

Outside of that, it's bullshit when people use discord like that.
    Or hosts who kick ppl who vote them out as an imp
        Y e s. This. I got kicked from a lobby after making friends and being friendly withe everyone, then when I said it was the host (I think he was like lime or smthn, doesn't really matter) and he got voted out, it was him, then he kicks me from the lobby for voting him out. Like what.
    And people wonder why I don't allow mics at ALL, even during emergency meetings.
    I sister keeps on telling me who she is when I play with her on mobile and keeps on asking for me to tell her my role. It’s stupidly annoying.
    and what is even the point of a win?  You can't even see any stats about how good you are.
    I don't understand the point. The game revolves around the imposter being a secret.

What purpose is there in playing if it's not?
    The community has 3 types of players. 

1: public lobbies following the rules  
2: private lobbies using discord to chat with friends during meetings     
 3:privte lobbies using discord to talk and yell the entire time "if I die I'm with red"

        Because it’s blatant cheating? The whole point of the game is to figure out who the imposter is through detective work. If your friend is telling you who it is, both of you are cheating and ruining the game for everyone else.
            [deleted]
                No, the dead can’t actually talk to the living in the game. They can see what the living are saying, but the dead can only talk to each other.

If the dead could tell who killed them, the game would be over really quickly, and the imposters would lose 99% of the time.
                    That makes perfect sense, cool. Definitely glad I picked it up, it looks really fun
                        Let me give you a tip: Search for a discord with an active playerbase rather quickly.

It'll be much better than random players (more logical conclusions, less random voting, less cheaters)
    you can’t kick during discussion anyway
        You can but everyone has to vote to kick them
    When I'm in discord even if we know who it i,we don't vote them or anything without real evidence.

                    One time I had a game where someone was cheating and they thought that was how you were supposed to play. I also had one where there were these 2 people just holding the lobby hostage cause one was imposter and there was 3 people.
                        Among us public servers suck, just play it with friends or find a lobby on discord servers.
                            Aye, since if no-one's cheating, you can't report anything.
"Hi so I saw black venting" (he was)
*instantly voted off*
                        The people in your first example were probably young children. Like when you play 100% luck boardgames with them and you're like "Wow you're really good in this game" and they really believe they have skill in rolling the dice, that's how old they probably were.
                    Thats why my username is Big PP so people know before hand.
            That way you can climb the leaderboards and unlock all the best armor.
        Imagine cheating in a game where there are absolutely no benefits to winning
        Imagine cheating
            Cheating single-player is fine, godmode with explosive bullets in far cry 5 is so fun. Multi-player cheating ruins it for everyone.
                Facts
        Imagine cheating on your girl
        Some people don't care about fun, they care about winning at any cost
    You know what's worse? Cheating on games that have no consequences. Literally 0. I could understand if it had a leader board or unlocks or a ranking system or level ups or stats but this game literally doesn't have any of this as of now. There is no incentive to play aside from having fun.

Why people do this is beyond me.
        Yes and it's also the worst when you call them out for cheating and they're just like "lol you're getting butt hurt over a game" or "I didn't realize you could cheat in this game"
        It's just people who lose all the time and are salty about it so they get their power trip by cheating. They also say things like "everyone hacks anyways" so they can rationalize how badly they play.
        I joined a game where one person had hacked the game to make themself the imposter every time and set it to instantly kill the other 9 players simultaneously as soon as the game started and they were doing it over and over... I was just like what’s the point? Like if there was a leaderboard ok but they were just waiting for the lobby to fill every time to win in one second
        Because the game is full of kids and kids are stupid
        They have fun by hurting others.
    I got ejected the other day because the other imposter didn’t have time to play anymore so he called an emergency meeting and told everyone that we were the two imposters and then left the game. I had already survived one round of voting and killed two crewmates. Literally nobody suspected me

Edit: am I The only one who constantly gets in games with people following around other characters saying “I love you” in chat and asking for their Snapchat?

            Wtf is that about? There was a guy who was following around one of the other players never did a single task and repeatedly would only say in chat shit like 

“I love you white” “ I love white” “i’m in love with white” 

I bailed on the lobby because this Dingus was just deadweight and like 10 minutes later I ended up in another lobby were somebody else was doing the same thing except he kept saying “I fucked pink”
        > Edit: am I The only one who constantly gets in games with people following around other characters saying “I love you” in chat and asking for their Snapchat?

Not snapchat, but I had someone praising me for being good and asking for my discord.
            Yeah I seem to keep finding these people who follow a character around and keep saying “ what’s your snap?/Can I have your snap?/Snap please”
    Or hacking in a party game like fall guys
    Cheatings wrong but i wish i could toggle never being imposter. Ive gotten many imposter wins but it just gives me so much anxiety.

        Lol the last game I played someone said the saw me vent but I wasn’t an imposter and they weren’t either... I was like wtf why??
            Sometimes you see a vent animation and then you see someone. Sometimes you mistake someone's colour because they're wearing a suit. Sometimes your brain plays tricks with you. Shit happens.
                They were standing right next to me in caf with nobody else and we weren’t by a vent so idk 🤷‍♀️
                    He was probably 9 years old and thought it was funny.
            Occasionally I’ll get lag where people blip in and out of existence. If that happens when you’re over a vent, I could see how a new player might think it was a venting.
            I played a game today where I couldn't find lime anywhere. I ran around the whole map and didn't see them, everyone else was done in cams. So I called a meeting. Said they were sus, they got voted and were an impostor. Then I saw orange do shields but there was no animation so I knew they faked it but I was out of meeting calls
            People do that all the time.  Had someone walk away from a deadbody and I reported it and they said it must be me.  We voted them off and they were innocent.  Its like whyyy??
        I haven't played the game but is saying you saw them vent (if they actually did) a valid reason? Or is that cheating like this post?
            [deleted]
        Oh that shits infuriating. I was imposter and walked my ass to security to watch some people and someone called a meeting and said I vented. Nothing I could do would change those peoples minds so I got ejected.
        I always say that ("I saw red vent"), when for example, I see them doing a common task that nobody has.
            Why not just say tht then if they kick red and hes not imp theyre gonna kick u and then ur down 2 ppl
                Cause public people don't understand common tasks
                    But its not the same as venting at all calling out  a vent is supposed to be 100% because u saw then vent. Common tasks arent 100% proof
    "if not red vote me next"
        That's the worst.  It's the confidence that sells it.

If it's a two imp game I normally type out something like "God dammit Gary (even if they're not Gary IRL), why are you such a little bitch?!  Hey all, he's the other imp."
            I try to sell it with fake salt.  "Man I ALWAYS get caught when I'm imp!  Screw this game!  Gray is other impo.  Fuck this."  I don't do it every time but any time you're solidly identified as imp right off the top it's an avenue for advantage.  Can't tell you how many times I've seen a group react to that with like 2 crew drops and then a vote to eject a crew member.
        Ughhh I hate this! And “not me, I have scan/trash”
        And then nobody votes them next
        [deleted]
    “He said Shhh at the beginning”
    Or cheating with mods.  This happened to me:
Guy runs into security where I am playing the fool, then goes sprinting out to call emergency meeting.

"It's yellow, I saw them vent into security.". Me-"that's a complete lie.  Clearly hacking since I haven't vented or killed anyone"
        I play on mobile, and I have had something similar happen almost every time I'm impostor. Don't kill or vent someone pushes the button and knows who both impostors are
        I'm upset to see these people out here.
    This is the fucking worst because everyone else is like “they probably saw them. Just vote.”
    Trust
    I had some saying exacly what happened, that they were told on discord etc.
And they would not accept that this was cheating.
I was told I should view it like the imposter was seen when he killed.
I would have killed them in real life if I have had the chance.
I wish they would permanently ban those people
    How, though?

            Link Steam account would be pretty easy
                The only problem with that is a lot of people play on mobile and not everyone has a steam account. Maybe they could have multiple options like steam, Google, facebook, instagram, etc.
                    Steam app on phone. But yeah, all the login options are good, so do all of them XD
                        You’re an idiot.
                        Not everyone has a steam account or wants one. The game is very popular among normal people aswell.
                    You can have a steam account without owning a pc. And steam has a mobile app.
                        I know but how many people do you think are going to go out and make a steam account just to play among us
                "easy"

You are clearly not a developer. Linking steam is not convenient for the developer. 

For the user? Yes. It's awesome.

For developers it is hell on Earth getting that shit to work
        They could probably add subtitles to the account? Cheater title for anyone who does this a certain number of times. And if they persist have a repeat offender title.
            Make them be the color cream and where the word shame around their necks.
            And what would check if they cheated? Manual review? AI? Both solutions are very unlikely to happen for a *3 people dev team.*
        [I proposed a solution on a post that got largely ignored.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmongUs/comments/j96eca/i_propose_we_rename_the_game_to_quiting_simulator/g8hpcun/) I think it would end the problem at least mitigate it. There is no need to make accounts , but steam games can store your id. And that would make punishments like this increasingly bad.
            Much like the Low Priority Queue that Dota 2 uses. If you quit X amount of games you get placed into the LPQ and have to finish a number of games in that queue to be released back into the wild. If you’re in the LPQ you can’t team up with friends and play ranked until you’re out and you also don’t gain any rank when playing LPQ a games.
                I actually thought of this concept for fixing Among Us and didn’t know it already existed. Cool!
                    The only downside to it in Dota is that it’s pretty harsh so if you have a few accidental disconnects in a row you’re stuck in a queue with the most toxic people in the game until you get out. But I’d much rather pay that price for accidental inclusion than let it go unpunished lol.
                        Dota is much higher stakes than Among Us isn't it? I think Among Us could have a system that just measures your average against the global average. If your rank is within the upper standard deviation, then you're good, so a few random disconnects shouldn't matter as long as you have a good track record of finishing games. In Dota it probably needs to be more strict because I imagine people would be selling their "good rep" accounts, though I don't imagine people doing that for Among Us.
        IP ban. Then hey have to use a different device or wifi network to play. Kids who use discord to cheat almost certainly don’t have a VPN so bypass is unlikely
        ip address or sum. that’s how growtopia did it. no one could play at my house lmao
            When Valve first introduced trust factor into CSGO people were reporting kow trust because of shares IPs (valve didnt confirm if it was true or not) where people in university or somewhere with a large group of people living together would all have low trust because someone else on that same ip had been banned before.

        I like how they think that banning you is some kind of threat or punishment. 

Dude, if you’re going to be that way then I’m going to be leaving the lobby on my own after the game is over.
    just leave and find a new lobby it’s not that serious
Host says to kick purple for cheating.
    But purple still cheated and the game is pretty much ruined
        Nah, nah. Eject purple and let the impostor win. Purple will probably ragequit. If they don’t, ban them.
            You assume the cheaters don’t make their own lobby’s
                [deleted]
                    I was in a lobby, killed someone with lights out and no one else around and their friend hit the emergency button and said “it’s purple I saw them kill and vent!”

I didn’t vent so I knew they were lying. I accused them of cheating and when the round ended we were back in the lobby. I asked “how did you see me?” And the host kicked me. I joined right back in and asked again “I’m sorry, you must have hit the wrong button by accident. How did you see me? There was no one around when I killed them.”

They responded by banning me. I was just hoping to get a confession that they were cheating but didn’t dignify that with a response. Oh well, I joined another lobby with people that actually played correctly
                    Idk, I always host the lobby and people still join and cheat all the time
                    I only play among us on the discord now
                    Pretty sure if enough people vote to kick the host it still works. 

Gotta do it in game though
                    My gf and I host our own lobby and cheaters still join.

The good news is, once you ban 1, the others usually leave too.
            Wow I never thought of this
            Still ruins the game.  
Just hopefully ruins it for the cheater more.
            Game still ruined no matter what you do. It's so frustrating when you finally get imposter and some cheating fuck ruins it
    [deleted]
    I wish I could blacklist them. Never see games hosted by them, they never see games hosted by me and if they are in a game I can see it is red before joining.
    Don't forget to also kick the dead guy who told purple
Its getting bad. Its getting to the point where all you get is "vote red, Trust"   and that's the only explanation then find out end of round, Discord, next to person or kick you for complaining in their group. I need a higher caliber of randos to play with.
    Also the game is so popular now that a lot of young kids/teens are playing and don't know/don't care about the etiquette of it. So one person cheats and the younger ones go along with it because they don't know who else to vote for. 

So it's not just that randoms suck, it's that some are literally children.
        That’s the story of any popular game tbf. Small game gets popular, attracts little kids, they ruin it for the other players.
            Hey I’m a kid and I play fairly and don’t randomly vote someone just cos someone else did😢 I hate it when other ppl just vote off somebody just cos one person voted even tho he didn’t say anything😒
Should be 100% a ban for this, happened to me last night. Infuriating, especially when you get Imp 1/20 times.
    Im pretty dumb but, wouldn't you have a 1/5 chance since with 1 imp there is a 1/10 and a 2/10 chance with 2 imps, and we shorten the 2/10 down to a 1/5.
Correct me if im wrong. (:
        Lol, I wasn’t trying to put in actual math figures, I was more using 1/20 more as an embellishment because it feels like that sometimes. Your math is right though.
            Ohhh i understand, yea i does feel really like you never get imp and when the chance is 20% its so wierd.
                That's entirely valid. Statistics say:

Over a large number of games, your observed number of impostor games should end up near 1/5, coming closer to 1/5 the more games you played.

But on the other hand, streaks are possible. There is still a (4/5)^n chance that your next n games will be crewmate. That's still n=1 80%, n=2 64%, 51%, 40%, 32%, .... So yeah, for a sequence of 3 games, it's just a coin flip to gain imposter once and it's quite likely to be crew "all the time". Especially because you remember things you dislike better.
                    I have a friend who only plays like 3 games and quits if hes not imposter by the 3rd game. So weve played 4 times and hes not been imposter and complains about it.

Hes like "well thats the 12th game without imposter". Yeah but you also dont really give it a chance to be imposter. Im fairly certain if he played all the rounds we played in a row, he wouldve been imposter atleast once. If you play 3 and quit, odds technically dont change but its like leaving one slot machine for another, its like theres a reset.
                Well the thing is it is a chance, it is totally possible that you just have a ton of rounds where you are not impostor or a ton of rounds where you are always impostor. It has to be completely random unfortunately.
                    True. Flip a coin 100 times, and in those flips you statistically would have had 7 heads or 7 tails in a row at some point. Tell a person to estimate a coin flip 100 times, and they probably wont do seven in a row at any point. 

People are really bad at imagining randomness
                    I was thinking about a way to improve on pure randomness. This way would require all players to make accounts.

A raffle system would work.

You could give each player account an extra ticket for every non imposter game they play out, and reset it when they play imposter. Give out negative chance to be imposter to punish quitting early for folks who just want to play imposter and quit every game they aren't.

So if you've played imposter last game or never played the game before, you have 10 tickets in the pool. In a ten person game that's the 10% baseline. But if you've played 5 non-imp games in a row you have 15 tickets.

Every game you quit, you lose a ticket for 24 hours. A strategy to ban quitter accounts and use cooldowns for accounts on quitter IPs could be implemented to beat people just trying to use 20 accounts to get around the restriction.

Streakiness is reduced and quitters are punished.
                    I played for four hours straight and didn't get impostor once. I should have recorded it. Probably set a record. Was playing 2 impostor lobbies as well.
        I have played 30 games straight without getting imposter once.
        Well yes but actually no
        But each games is it's own 1 or 2 out of 10.

Flipping a coin 100 times and they could all land heads. Doesn't meant the chance isnt still 50/50.
when u get the wild card but everyone else has the +2

    Honestly this game is broken for me now. between discord cheaters and people who leave because they weren't imposter, I haven't had a decent game in about a week now. Ah well, fun while it lasted
        I have never played Among Us but have been entertained by watching people play in private games who clearly respect the rules. I knew from watching it that playing public games would be a complete waste of time as it’s just wide open to cheaters. Unfortunately the lowest common denominator will always fuck up the honour system for everyone else.
            I’ve found that watching the settings can help get better games. Cheaters and people that drop because they didn’t get imposter tends to prefer really unbalanced settings. 

Some of my best games have been one off public servers. Having friends in discord makes it more fun to play for 5 hours straight, but they start to learn your play style and that makes it harder as imposter.
            Honestly, most games are not as filled with cheaters as some would have you believe. It does happen and will happen to you, but I wouldn't say I run into that every day. I have 10ish hours of playtime and ran into that maybe 3 or 4 times.

The actual common one that happens in, what feels like half the games, is 1-2 people leaving right at the start because they didn't get impostor. That stings, because IF you have a 10/10 full lobby and that happens, you pretty much need to vote one of the impostors out in that first meeting. If it wasn't a full lobby, or if 3 people quit, you might as well all quit and join a new lobby.

All of the games issues go away when you play with a group of friends though. The game is definitely best enjoyed with friends, or at least in a Discord call of rule-abiding people
            It was fine in the beginning, but it's gotten completely out of control recently. Just uninstalled
            I recommend joining the r/AmongUs discord and playing over voice chat. Sure, you encounter cheaters and bad sports once in a while, but the game quality is 10x better than playing over text imo.
        Well if it helps, I’ve heard there’s an among us discord server you could join and find people to play with, that way you don’t have to deal with all the crap you usually deal with in Public lobbies
        I find it best to at least have two other friends. Best if it's 5-6. You find decent randoms pretty quickly, who we invite to the discord... rinse and repeat each night someone plays. Once the room is full with decent people, all of this bullshit is unnecessary.

This is why I use discord for among us only now 

Screw asshole randoms
    I cant imagine buying this game and only playing publics
        I only play public when my group is offline. I wish my group was on more.
        I only play public (I’m on the free mobile version) because I can’t get my friends to play and the ones who do are on different work schedules than me so if I want to play it’s public or bust. If I don’t like a game or I can tell it’s discord run then I leave and find a new one! I’ve had a lot of fun actually in some public ones.
            Same. I mainly play on Mira now too. I just want a quick 10 minutes of fun between work assignments throughout the day. Public is the easiest. If I hate a lobby, I bounce.
            Join any of the public discords (some are full, but new ones always pop up. It took me about 15 mins to find one that worked). It's the same random lobby type experience but when everyone has to actually talk to each other you get a lot fewer people ruining the game.
        I could only stand the garbage of public lobbies for 20 minutes before rage quitting. I only play when my friends are online now sadly
        If you don't have discord and aren't used to it, it feels kinda daunting to figure out at first. I powered through it this week so I could find lobbies and I'm so glad I did
        I don't have friends
            Theres plenty of discord servers for matchmaking if you're on PC
                Yeah true but I'm too lazy for that lmfaoooo
    EL5, there's another way to play besides public lobbies? Help a brother out? I feel so old
        You gotta join a dedicated among us discord. There is an official Innersloth discord but I heard it's full. But there are plenty private ones, just ask on the subreddit or sth. Playing eith randoms is cancer, dont do it to your blood pressure.
        This subreddit has a discord.

Download discord and make an account. Do all the activation stuff. Follow the link in the sidebar to go to the server.

Do the reaction in the main thread then you can access the LFG (looking for game) threads. There, people post links to games that need a player where you can join and do voice chat. They also have no mic LFG lobbies if you want the silent experience.

Trust, I felt old too trying to figure this out.
Happened to me just 10 minutes ago it’s so annoying had to hit them with the little bitch then I got banned
    Same here. The discord cheater was the host, so when I called her on the cheating (the rest of the group voted me out) I just got kicked.  What a cun.t.
        This just happened to me! I hate being the impostor, but I was doing a little better. (I just started playing and I’m not sneaky) I finally made a kill and they had suspected everyone but me... and someone says “I’m on the phone with them and it’s [me].” It was the room host so I left the game. Just when I was starting to get better at being imp they ruined it for me.
            Oh they don't just ruin it for the imposter, they ruin the game for everyone.  No matter what happens (play it out or quit) the game is wasted.
                Exactly! I had played another room where there were 2 cousins on the phone and they kept it pretty fair from what I can remember. This was my first encounter with cheating that blatant, and it definitely deflated the fun.
This literally happened to me and we kicked out the cheater
    I joined a random lobby today and 10 seconds in an emergency meeting was called. Without a spoken word from any of the other players, they voted me off. Every single person. 

Wasn't even the imposter either
        oh crap I think that was my discord group. my bad dude. I kept telling them that we shouldn’t make the server public because it’s annoying and randoms hate it. for some reason, they insisted.
I want to take the time to appreciate that the meme text is written in cyan. An unnecessary touh that adds to the meme. Good meme.
    Thank you lol, figured changing the font color was easier on the eyes than making a cheap phone edit to have Bernie be cyan
* that was the other imposter*

* everyone votes him out and now trusts you *
Hmmmmm.... Purple kinda sus...
    That's something that only an imposter would say!
        :)  :D
“Hey guys Im cheating! Isn’t that so cool???”
    I've seen cheaters who actually seem proud of it, like wtf are they thinking
You do that, automatically vote you out.
You know whats worse... getting killed by your fellow imposter cause he said in chat i got voted out because the imposter straight up said “ white is the iimposter” if you see this amy fuck you
My own teammate fucked me up one time because he was in the same room or discord with two other people, the one I killed, and the one accusing me for venting after I killed the body and he “saw me”. All he had to do was vote red with me and we would’ve won
Called an emergency meeting last night to vote out the cheater and got voted out myself for "wasting everyone's time", sometimes you just can't win...
Honestly, WHY... like this game is much much forgiving for “killed” person. You still able to walk, do your task, and watch the game. There are tons of game like this where when you get killed, you have 0 thing do.

Then, this game does not have any level or season pass, so why the fuck do you cheat.

You, yes you, discord cheater

You, FUCK YOU
I hate teamers and hackers so bad.
Even worse when they call a meeting before you even did anything and they call you out.
imagine cheating in a game where the only reward is the enjoyment you get out of it.
    I don't get it! There is no reward for winning! Why cheat?
        To feel powerful.

That's literally all they need and is the reason why most are cheating. Not to pad some statistic, they know it's fake. It's only to dominate others most of the time.
        bc they're kids who are too young to understand why they are playing what they are playing and too dumb to play the game legitimately, so they feel the need to cheat to "win". saves them the brain power of actually having to determine who the impostor is genuinely.
When people falsely accuse you because their friend told them they usually say it a bit after when the meeting started. So I usually say “if you saw me (their reason) then why didn’t you bring it up in the first place and why didn’t you call an emergency meeting/report the body?” Usually fucks them up and we catch them cheating, unless dumbasses who vote off of the first accusation vote you
    That's a good point, but as someone said, randoms vote pretty quickly and don't listen to alibis or defenses.
"____ sus" as literally the whole lobby already voted for you and no one has said a damned thing. fun times
I hate those people. They ruin the game.
    Happy cakeday!

Soooo much hate for snitchers. I got one yesterday where I had to explain how it was against the rules. He then asked where are the rules at and my reply was, "Well, it's in the 'How To Play' section, it's on the website, and the big red guy saying 'Shhhhhhhh' at the beginning of every round is telling you TO KEEP YOUR GODDAMN MOUTH SHUT."

He then banned me from the server.
[deleted]
    I had people running around for SIX MINUTES and 2/3 task bars full. Third guy did no tasks... Impostor wanted us to win but the stupid player actively didn't do any tasks.
        [deleted]
            Played ina  discord server last night and kept getting voted out because I would finish my tasks first and late game people would ask me to do a task to prove I'm a crewmate. Like bitch, it takes 4 minutes to do 5 tasks its not my fault you guys don't know how to play.
        If that guy wasnt the host then the host should have kicked him so they had a chance of winning
Still just vote out purple fuck that guy and his friend if they do that
If I were crewmate when that happened I’d vote out the cheater and try and let the imposter win so they won’t get the satisfaction of winning
The problem with that is they never say why they know, they just go It's cyan trust me, he killed black. And then as lobby host you have to wait till you get imposter, make sure you get black or purple alone then kill one of them to see if they are cheating. So you have to throw your imposter game, sus out discord users then ban them when you get back to the lobby. On the plus side as someone who normally sets good game settings and waits for full lobbies a group of players will normally stick around a while, and kick cheaters during the game when you sus them out.
    > So you have to throw your imposter game, sus out discord users then ban them when you get back to the lobby. 

This sounds like a meta Among Us game. :D
        There are 2 cheaters among us
Even just looking at this makes me pissed

Not the meme the meme is good
My go to response is "you're either lying or cheating so I say everyone vote you first for ruining the game.  Then you all can vote me next round"

It really is frustrating when it happens
I had one where there was a hacker and he immediately called an emergency meeting and said it was me...
Is there a report cheating button? If not, why not??
    Because it's literally a 2 year old game that only got popular in the last 2 months. Things take time to implement mate.
Wait, I think I was cyan. Purple also accused me some time ago
    White was the one I killed
I see Bernie, I upvote.
    I hope you went and voted too!
        I did. Also maxed donations and was on his texting team. Still didn't matter :(
            I am so jaded now. I just don't care anymore. We are ruled by corrupt cynics, and lobbyists for big oil and the arms dealers trying to make a quick buck. 

Whatever, we're all gonna be dead in 100 years from climate change anyways, may as well try to enjoy my life while I can instead of parasocially obsessing over shit I have no control over. I'm trying to cut out politics from my media diet, and it bothers me how prominent it is on Reddit, it makes me consider leaving the site. It is like taking a weed whacker to your mental health.
                Sounds like a good response. Be sure to take care of yourself first for sure.
            It absolutely mattered you need to lose that mindset man, had bernie not campaigned as hard as he did and made it as far as he did this platform would look a lot different.  You're effort and work forced concessions and made compromises and that's the cornerstone to democracy.

It reminds me of a quote by a shitty super scientist it is heavy-handed in its brow beating but the message rings true:


"I get it I suddenly get it you're children. That's why my dad put you in the pool and made you duke it out. News flash: my dad was a shitty parent! But when my boys cry about Fairness I remind them that fairness is the philosophical Tooth Fairy! There is no fairness!  

You won't get everything but you will get something, enough with this fairness crap and make some compromises and you get to go home to your friends in their costumes and brag about how much you got em', or you can go back and go "oh we didn't get everything we wanted so we took nothing."
                Until I see any change, I will keep my mindset. We don't have time to take babysteps to appease corrupt CEOs and the selfish moronic masses. People are dying and the earth is getting hotter. 

And I dont trust Biden to make any meaningful changes. If he does great, glad I voted for him. But im not holding my breath.  Let's hope there is a world for your kids to enjoy.

Global warming doesn't give a shit about your concessions. All the species now extinct dont give a shit about compromises. Thousands upon thousands dying due to lack of Healthcare shouldn't be told "hey cheer up, we made some headway!". Catering to selfish assholes is not progress. Progress is progress.
                    You already made the compromise you voted for him becuase you saw him as the better choice of the two at some level you do understand the need for compromise for progress to move forward.  I know you're angry and it's justified we're in deep shit but I'm sorry you need to grow the fuck up if you think compromise doesn't lead to progress. 

A political minority has no right to try to and bowl over everyone else to just thier style of thinking.  You want to come to the table?  You better be willing to give as much as you take.
                        Lol, we already cater to the minority. Republicans. 

And you need to grow up if you think the last 40 years of compromise has lead to meaning progress. Sure, guys can marry now, but what else. How is the money difference between rich and poor any better. How many people have been saved by lasting Healthcare that wasn't immediately overturned.  

If you want to roll over and show your belly cause it makes you feel better fine, but don't try and act like we are making progress. Once your grow up and learn something you will see how only one side is compromising. 

In a working country yes compromise works and leads to progress. America is not a functioning country by any metric.
                            Hey outside of our argument I peeped your profile and I apologize for misgendering you in the second reply and rectified the problem won't happen again.

And compromise isn't showing your belly and it's that exact mentality that leads others to think compromise is a bad word.  Look no further then virginia to see where small incremental change led to a blue virginia.  Shit sucks and I'm sorry it's not fixed right now this second BUT I will not support a movement who claims to have all the answers to fix all our problems and is unwilling to compromise with people.  That's what we got right now and I just really don't think it's as simple as: the other guy has all the answers.
            Well i meant i hope you voted for Biden. I am a bernie supporter too but my main goal right now is get trump out of office
                Agreed
I hate people like purple
Yeah, technically, if they're dead, they shouldn't speak, even on discord.

It saps the fun and drama out, yet people take it way too seriously.

Such as the people that say: "F\*%# You! Impostor!"
    Some people are desperate for a win
Vote for purple first because purple ruined the game
The Cyan lettering was chef's kiss.
Can we please Normalize kicking people who do this?
"Guys it just how I want to play the game"
They vote purple out
“You are the enemy of the people.”
Randoms. I fucking hate them.
I lost a game when there were 3 crewmates and 2 impostors left and I had perfectly framed someone else. But no dumb discord cheaters have to ruin it all :(
This happens to me all the time and I admit to being the imposter and ask to vote them out but no one listens
Unfortunately its not possible to have a random lobby and nobody leaving it
Or when the whole lobby is like "skip then??" No hoes we voting purple cuz hes a cheater
I’ve had this happen twice in end game scenarios and I always win cause nobody believes them.
I had one game where the imposter was kicked without anything in the chat happening. Followed by an emergency meeting, again, nothing in the chat, and the second imposter was kicked. Worst game ever.
As I always say:  
Among Us is 5% fun, 95% frustration...
This and also when someone falsely accuses you of venting when your imposter even though you never did! This happens one out of like 3 games where I'm imposter.
    I think its a cover for cheaters. It almost has to be. I had someone do that when I didn't vent into a room and wasn't standing near the vent. Of course they were right, because I just killed across the map and booked it
Just happened to me. I was imposter doing super good, and they just randomly press emergency and insta vote me. I asked why and they said they were on discord. It was 4 people.....I told them to play in a private server and they cursed me out and banned me. Game is kind of unplayable right now with all the cheating and hacking.
Lol I saw someone kill but just stood there like are you going to report or am I going to report? I don't want to get too close to you... are we becoming friends? will you spare me until we get down to the last couple of people?
So I got imposter and this happened to me, no one in the group defended me and instead hesitated a little to believe the cheater. Mind you he completely admitted to having a friend irl. They then trusted him and I kept saying “that’s cheating”. In the lobby, I was shocked, no one considered it cheating and I felt like I was in the twilight zone.
I had something like that happen. We were all so annoyed that we voted that guy off even though he’d ratted me out. Won the game with that vote.
[Purple gets voted out](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/it/8/8e/Parabola_%28Tool%29.png)
They need to stop giving people the option to say whether or not they ejected the imposter. 

I feel like if they did that, there would be a lot more hesitancy to just eject someone with no evidence or convincing.
So sad when dead people tell others who killed them\*

&#x200B;

\*this sentence makes very little sense anywhere except on this subreddit.
I just play 1 impostor games in public matches cuz if it's 2 impostor one or two are gonna leave the game anyways so impostors have 4 people to kill and they kill 2 in stack and one guy atleast will be blamed wrong while the other they kill so ez win for impostors always. Unlike 1 impostor games where even if 2 people leave and 1 is blamed the solo impostor still has to kill 4 people to get a guaranteed win
Anytime this happens, if the lobby doesn't immediately kick the cheater i just leave. Im tired of it
Imagine being this idiot kid seeing everyone pissed at him for ruining the game
Yesterday I was playing and there were two people on that were together irl. One was an imposter and the crew mate friend was helping the imposter and kept voting for randoms to save them. We lost that game because of you, pink. 😡
You just vote'em out for cheating. That's all.
Or another type of hacker joins, that teleports all of you all around the map, and then insta votes out one of the impostors the milisecond voting starts
Ikr or when u lock the doors and kill and suddenly someone calls an emergency meeting saying they “saw you kill” and everyone just believes them
Dude I was in that game with you I remember the name Eitiost. I remember him saying he was online on discord with his friends.I can’t believe I found this lol it’s a small world
These people are typically children who watched their favorite YouTuber play it and think they can do the same thing
Once this kid knew it was me because he was looking at his friend's iPad and they all voted me out. People like that suck.
I don’t play public games but doesn’t this sound like something an imposter would do? 

You claim to be crew and in discord with the guy who died that can’t confirm your wild accusation so that another crew member gets kicked immediately and in your mind you cleared yourself as crew... it baffles me that this continues to ruin games and has not become standard imposter practice that would now be invalidated. An imposter would know the second someone died and could immediately self report with this claim. Turn it back on the reporter and continue the game. Do people in public games not realize that people are often lying? It’s kind of the whole point of the game.
Had that happen to me, some kid was saying that I killed his sister and he saw on her phone, when it was 3 or 4 people. I said that would be cheating and then he/she said I was cheating because I was lying (wtf?).  Still managed to convince the others it wasnt me somehow and won. Public lobbies are shit.
I one got imposter but was afk and I watched and people were around me watching me stand there and purple hit the emergency meeting so I said what like everyone else and purple claimed they saw me vent even tho I was being watched by majority of the crew and they believed him so I said I was the impostor but I never vented lied so next match the owner kicked them for lying.
I just had this happen to me I do hate it when this happens
This keeps happening to me. I get a perfect kill, no one sees me from cams, no one sees me run away, no one sees me vent but when the body is reported someone says my colour and I get voted off by the entire lobby. So triggering especially when it takes 5 games to get impostor.
I’m the 69th awarder nice
its cyan trust.

why?

just trust
Honestly. You immediately ruin the game and i hate it
Bruh moment
Once had a guy who didn’t stop saying I was imp bc “he was sitting next to me and saw it on my phone”. I was home alone. Why the fuck would anyone do this
This happen to me yesterday =\_= I killed a guy and immediately there was an emergency meeting. No body found no one in my area after I made the kill and the guy says "Orange you're so stupid. It's orange, He killed my friend" 

I'M STUPID?!! Learn how to play the game!
I was imp recently and someone called a meeting to ask everyone to follow their tiktok, and I had to sit and wait for them and two others to stop talking about how many followers they had and how inspirational the meeting caller was, it was agony. Then this time wasting dunce decided to call ANOTHER meeting to CONTINUE TALKING about FLIPPIN TIKTOK, and when I started to chew them out they voted me off for no other reason than that I wanted to play the game instead of listen to these idiots slobber over tiktok and each other and won. I hate people sometimes.
i once joined a lobby where it was three other people and as soon as i joined they started and i got impostor. one of them called an emergency meeting almost immediately and they voted me off without saying anything :( this was when i was really new at the game too so i was super confused but they likely were on a discord call or smthn looking back at it
this game isn't even enjoyable as a somewhat mindless time passer anymore with all the asshole kids on it
Kinda dick move ngl
I hate these pieces of crap players.
Or “fuck you guys, the other imposter is cyan”
This is something that I hope they can address in Among Us 2, but the truth is people can cheat if they really want to. They should have an option to kick players off the game if they were found to be cheating though, otherwise there is no deterrent against it.
this is why you shoudl be able to make games WITHOUT codes

so friends CANT join
    This is the best idea I’ve seen on here. If you select that option, you’ll also be placed into a random lobby based on your preferences (that way friends can’t find the same game in their search somehow)
Congrats for reaching r/all/top/ (of the day, top 25) with your post!

I Uninstalled because of this. Devs need to at least make it known this is cheating because many people don't seem to think they're doing anything wrong.

Oh well. Its a fun idea, but this happens to me seemingly every game
They should add a Block button so more time they play like that they will play with no one
This happens so often i hate it. At least do something funny
Why can’t people understand that using Discord in games like Among Us is the ultimate dick move?
what if you did that when you were an imposter 

it could be a good trick
While I do play with  my friend on discord we have two rules 

1:Never tell the other who did it when you die

2:Never give hints on who did it when you die
So true! I feel this lol
For as often as I see this meme over and over, I've only ever had this happen to me once.
coloring the text cyan, that's a smart way to hint that you are the cyan purple is referring to
People like this made me stop playing.
Lmao I always reply with : bro everyone knows that meme it's not even that funny
Delete purple
Honestly, I’m interested in the game, but haven’t gotten it because of this. Same thing happened in Dead by Daylight. Discord chat ruins the game and makes it unplayable. If I can get a group together I’ll probably pick it up, but not for blind players.
Repost from r/memes
    Nah check the time stamps. The bot even notified me that it was reposted there
discord the the greatest alibi tho
This is why I hate playing with randoms. They either leave the game immediately after finding out they're not imposter or they cheat. Seriously want to refund the game.
    K
    The game is $5 dude, just play with friends.
        We all have vastly different schedules so even when we do play together we still have to play with randos who cheat.
            There's like hundreds of discord servers for Among Us out there which you can join and most semi-decently sized ones can get a full lobby within 5-30min, depending on your luck.
    Join a discord group and play
        That's not an option for everyone
            Uhhhh, yes it is?
            Why?
            [deleted]
            Just join the r/amongus discord or the Among Us LFG discord
it makes me sad ): some lobbies give u the win, but i don’t want it that way. someone did this yesterday, and thought we couldn’t kick them bcs “they were owner!!”. i tried to explain how the kick system works, but we didn’t have time to get it together and they won.
THIS IS KARMA FARMING AND IT WORKED-
Who tf plays with randoms lol
    The majority of people who doesnt have friends
        Oh, sad.
Why even play with strangers it's not fun at all
    Cause not all of us has friends that play the game
Still ruins the game if you vote him out as the game would have also ended if they let you win by killing everyone
    People have started doing this, and lying, just to ruin the game.

Just this morning, I was one of two impostors. I killed blue first, and lime starts spewing out “I’m friends with blue and he told me black did it!!!!” even though black was definitely not an impostor. 

We voted out lime and he left after cussing up a storm and telling us to kill ourselves, but the game was still ruined because people still suspected black based on lime’s baseless accusation. Combined with the standard 1-2 people leaving as soon as the game starts, by the end it was just too easy of a win and not fun at all for anyone.

After the game, blue said that he had no idea who lime was, so that idiot was literally just there to ruin other people’s fun. Fucking douchebag.
        [deleted]
            From what I understand the dev is working on an account system exactly so they can ban people like that.
                Idk how it isn’t a thing already. I get this has been a smaller game for the past couple years and there was probably just a code of honor in place, but I’ve played enough Gmod to know how much of a problem meta gaming and ghosting can be.
                    You don't always foresee these type of issues..
                        You shouldn't have to plan around the lowest common denominator...but we do.

If people can fuck something up, there's some asshole out there willing to try
                        Happy cake day
                    they were intending the game for groups of friends mostly. who may even be on a couch together. and the online play was a bit of an afterthought, afaik. so they never thought that would be such a problem
            Petition for this bruh! Where should I sign
        The innersloth official discord has rooms for among us, negating this problem
        The worst part is the fact he tried to tell your group to kill themselves. That messed up and it should be a crime
            It actually is, at least where I’m from
                Welp now we have a reason to arrest that douchebag
        if he was imposter it would have been alright ,but he wasnt
    That’s when everyone needs to be on the same page. Continue playing without voting anyone off and without reporting bodies. Everyone tries to finish their tasks without getting killed
        Still ruined.
            [deleted]
                bruh
                    I'll skate to the beach! And I'll look better gettin' there.
                Angel Dust was a sick album!
                Is that supposed to be a dollar store version of a rickroll
                    HAHAHA!
                Lmao when the drummer starts playing the lead singer.
            Like with spoilers in Twitch chat you all have to pre-emptively and continuously spam the chat with false accusations to drown out the real ones. Only option.
                I hate twitch.

I also like twitch.
                    No one likes Twitch. It's a terrible blight. 

Anyways, gotta go. My Twitch stream starts in 5 minutes!
                Most streamers I watch play the game turn their chats on emote only when they are playing and they go back to regular text chats when they are in the lobbies
                *Laughs in emote only
            Username sounds very familiar...


...János.
            Not necessarily. Just turn it into Alien vs Crewmate.
(Hide and Seek, https://youtu.be/abYgE5TdOm0)
            Not ruined if u turn it into hide and seek
        Whats even the point then
            It keeps the game going without completely ruining it for the poor bastard that finally got imposter after probably waiting over an hour
                But why continue. All the fun of the game is lost even if it is a shame that the imposter was revealed by a cheat
                    Because then it becomes a different game. Plenty of folks play variations like this anyway.
                        Yes but the entire premise is to find the imposter and everyone knows who the imposter is then why would you play? It's not gonna be hard for the imposter to just kill everyone if they deliberately don't vote him off. Just end the match, kick the cheat and move on to the next one lmfao
                            It turns into hide and seek which is actually pretty fun. The entire point is knowing the seeker/imposter and avoiding them while doing tasks at the same time. It kinda becomes dead by daylight in a way.
                                Would be good to have a "hide-and-seek" voting option down next to skip.  When this sort of thing happens and a majority vote hide-and-seek the game changes modes, reduces vision and increases movement speed for crewmates (and the inverse for imposter), reduces kill timer, disables the emergency button and reporting, and away you go.
                                I applaud the duck out of you guys who don’t let a cheater ruin your gaming experience.
                            The premise is to NOT BE KILLED, not to find the imposter.  That is why you can easily win games (if everyone isn’t a dumbass) by doing your tasks.  

The objective is to live and get your team out of that area, not to necessarily find the imposter.
                                EvErYoNe WhO dOeSn'T PlAy LiKe I dO iS a DuMbAsS....

The objective is to have fun, it's a game.  Winning easily isn't always the route one would want to take.  Others disagree.
                            No the point is to get all the tasks done or eject the imposter.
                    I wouldn’t say it’s lost. It can still be fun that way considering it’ll become more of a hide & seek from that point forward. It sucks that it was ruined, but that’s an easy way to salvage the game
    Happened to me once and they didn't wanted to vote me cuz felt bad :((( 

Still made them vote me so we can play another one
    I had a really fun game where I was imposter. Other imposter got caught and named me before he was voted off. Everyone understood, and just pretended they didn’t know. 
It got really obvious near the end I was just killing whoever and everyone was ignoring the bodies.
        That’s so fucked. Sorry that game was ruined.
            But that’s the thing, we didn’t let them ruin the game. We just had fun with it.
    You're supposed to mute your mic between meetings. Playing like they are is ruining the game.
I try to defend the accused. I just massively doubt them. Often I get voted out as well, even if not the impostor, but I try to put it back on them. Nobody can corroborate that they were actually in Discord with that person. Why should we trust that statement?

What if Purple was the impostor blaming Cyan for their kill? What if confirms are off? Youd never know.
    your good for that dude
    Precisely why I like playing with confirm off. The stakes are much higher not having any real argument.
        I wont because I'm not a dick, but I want to start faking being in Discord with someone. I mostly play solo. So I join a game with confirms off. When I'm impostor, just be like [dead color] told me [alive color] did it. We are in Discord. I'd be flat out lying, but everyone just believes that shit. I'm so tempted to try it.
            I would say to only use it after someone else has said it.  
  
"Red told me Yellow killed him through Discord!"

"What are you talking about? Red just told me it was you who killed him, how could you lie about that!"
                That's a good one!
                Ooh, I like it.  Countering with their own shit.  Might buy some time, and even if the metagaming guy was crew and correct that yellow was imposter he deserves to get spaced anyway for metagaming
            May as well. Not like most random lobbies have players with an attention span longer than 15 seconds with confirm on. “White was not an imposter “ - “welp, guess we’ll just forget red fully lied about seeing him kill yellow.”

Win so many games as imposter that way.
                That just leads to "vote them and if not vote me" argument which is also stupid. Suiciding as an impostor is great if there are multiples. 

Imagine there are 2 impostors. You get caught in a kill and get a crewmember vented before you and you just took out at least 2 people. That leaves the other impostor 6v1, which isnt great, but not bad given how quickly some other random impostors get murdered.

Now imagine you take out before you suicide vent, your teammate and you take out 4 people. Then plus the vented crewmember you used "vote them and if not vote me" on, your lone teammate is at a 1v4. I really like those odds if I'm the lone impostor.
                    That’s why I just do “I saw them kill x right in front of me.” Just as soon as the chat box comes up. With 2 imposters and no confirm I can make it work at least twice.

But I used the “saw them kill right in front of me” tactic 9v1 with confirm on and the one guy who stuck around too call a meeting after ejecting an innocent was the next victim. Next meeting was down to 3 and there was no accusation even leveled resulting in a skip vote. Had the other two remembered 5 minutes prior I would have lost.
                        I was 1v3 and got seen killing. Blamed the other guy, saying "if not him then vote me next." 1v2, I'm hoping I can get the last kill before they can call the meeting. Right after, I check the meeting cooldown, it's 3 seconds shorter than my kill cooldown. Crap, I just lost. Except the 2 dumbasses immediately run off to do missions. Okay, I'll wait by the button and sabotage 02. As soon as they clear the emergency, I duck down to admin for the win.  
Like come on.. See the bigger picture. You know I'm the only imposter and I only need one more kill. If you call the meeting, you win. If my cooldown is shorter, you lose. If you don't hit the #@&$ button, you lose!
            Yea people get all on about honor and stuff in this game trying to play it like fucking sherlock holmes. Nah go full puppet master, just claim people are faking tasks, say "vote me out if I'm wrong" then next time around self report and urgently blame someone else.
            i did somthing similar once by fake ratting out the other imposter ,of sadly the innocent who i blamed got really mad and i got kicked after the game
            I play like this tbh, and it's pretty effective. I haven't tried the "I'm in discord, it's him" claim yet, but I'm definitely going too now. The big one I like doing is fake snitching on my other impostor when I'm blatantly busted. Like 2 people see me kill on cams, so I know I'm going out the airlock, but I'll fake being salty about it, pick a quiet crew member, claim they're an idiot and not helping me, and say to eject them too. %60 of the time it works every time, especially if my real other impostor isn't sus and piles on.

EDIT: You shouldn't even feel like a dick playing like this either. The point of being impostor is to mess with crew to throw sus off you, and anything goes that way. Lying about being in discord with a dead guy isn't any different then lying about not killing them in the first place.
            What I can tell you is after seeing a bunch of butthurt imposters get caught call out the other imposters in chat before they get ejected, I've started doing the same.

Except I call out some random innocent guy, and so far 100% of the time that guy will get immediately ejected. I feel bad about it but was hoping to spread doubt in the community of just believing these dickheads. 

So go for it. They will absolutely eject them without a second thought because most people are idiots.
    Chaotic good
    One startegy I do is "*killed person* is my friend, I'm in a discord call with them, they told me it's *random person I decide to accuse*".

Doesn't really work because I play with a group of friends over discord, but it's the thought that counts.
        This was my idea and I play as a solo. I'd feel bad about "ruining" a game, even though I'm just fake ruining it. But I want to see how many times everyone would believe me lol
            Exact same problem here. I only do it as a joke among my friends because I'm too scared to do it in a public lobby
            Yeah I've been tempted to pull that in a public lobby myself, but it just ends up feeling *wrong* to me and stop before going through with it
Except when they aren't stupid enough to tell them they are cheating. Like this guy yesterday who said I killed and vented in front of him when I closed both doors and double checked there wasn't anyone in those rooms. So I confessed being the impostor after everyone voted but the guy is talking with the dead because he had no way to see me kill or vent but they didn't believe me :c
    This happened to me yesterday.  I killed someone in electric and vented to medbay immediately as noone walked into either room. Literally like 3 seconds later someone called a meeting and said they saw me kill and vent from electric. There is no way they would've gotten from electric to the cafeteria at the same as me venting to medbay, unless they were lying and already in the cafe, but of course randoms vote quick as hell without hearing reasoning or defenses so I was ejected.
        The vent animation shows up even if you don't have direct line of sight to the vent. If you are standing in security you can see the vents in both electrical and medbay. With that it's pretty easy to run by and see who is leaving the room that was vented to.

You can also see the vent in electrical from the behind the first wall in electrical. If you know who was on the other side before seeing the vent animation then you know who the imposter is.
            Notice how it took longer than 3 seconds to get to the button. The point im trying to make is none of the things that everyone is saying explains the speed in which he called the meeting so fast that you cant even make a move after getting out of the vent. Its not like I hovered in the vent either. I went in and out of the vent immediately after killing.
        Lets say I'm getting gas to refuel the engines, and I see you walk into electrical. I decide to stop by electrical to do wires on my way to the engine, but you're not there, and there's a dead body. I didn't see you come out, so the only logical assumption is that you killed them and fled the scene through a vent.

You don't have to directly witness something to figure out what happened.
            To be fair, he did say that he called a meeting, as opposed to reporting the body, and said he was in the cafe (which confirms that).  There is still one viable possibility, though, without knowing more details:  Maybe he was watching Admin, and saw a user disappear from electric, at the same time one appeared in MedBay  (i.e. "saw you vent"), and when he went towards cafe to confirm, saw you coming from MedBay?  I've heard there's a way to "see" kills on admin (the icon flickers or something?)
                I do this, admin is incredibly useful when people are randomly wandering around to see if it was a self report by the killer, 2 blips, 1 blip and a report and you know they just self reported.
                    Dead bodies still show up in admin on Skeld though, right? So how does this help?
                        If there are only 2 blips and its reported the one that reported had to be the one that did it if nothing else has moved since.
                            Yeah what I’m saying is you would have to sit and wait for a while. A dead body and someone who has three tasks in electrical look very similar unless you just sit at admin. Even then, someone walking in after and reporting would fit your criteria as it would appear as if two people were in there when they walked into a room with a dead body. 

This is assuming I am right about bodies appearing on admin map, which I’m fairly sure is right.
                                He reported right when I popped out of the vent so it was in the span of like 3 seconds
    I was an imposter but hadn't killed anyone yet. I was on the opposite side of the map when a crewmate was killed and someone (not other imposter) starts telling everyone they saw *me* do it. I was so pissed they voted for me because they felt vindicated, but they were fucking wrong.
        I hate it when this happens
        I was in a game where after a dead body was found and it turned out to be the 2nd body, they were all, "This imposter seems far more competent. Vote Tathas out."  

I mean, it was me, but nobody had any actual proof.
            Only thing to do is haunt their asses
    Yeah this has happened to me before, I always called them out for cheating. Sadly no one cares
I got stuck with one group where all of them were on discord. I told them why not set the game to private then? And they kicked me and I wasnt even the imp.
    Their dicks
        What about their dicks?
            They are small
    Sounds like my "friend" group. Stopped playing with them right away
This is why I host games myself. If someone says they are on discord with their buddy I ask who their buddy is and I kick them both. I don't like being THAT guy but it's just not fair on anyone else. 

I mean if you want to play with your buddies on discord host a game and discord or join a game with a discord but when it's just you and your buddy with randoms it gives you an unfair advantage as both the imposter and as a crew mate.
    I'd love being that guy. Fuck em
    I’m always on discord with my friends. We don’t cheat or tell who killed us. Kicking people just because they are on discord is dumb. Everyone using discord doesn’t cheat. We want to play the game and removing any challenge from the game removes the fun.
        I play on Discord with my friends, but I dislike it for public matches. Even if the Discord group isn't cheating, they seldom talk to the rest of the players. I was in a game where half the players voted for one guy with no discussion. When I asked, they told me they were in Discord. So it's a crappy thing to do if you aren't communicating with the players who are not in your Discord.
            We use the in game chat as well.
                This is how my friends play in public as well, I make sure my friends are typing in chat what we're saying in voice.
                    [deleted]
                        We use an xbox chat cuz we don't all have discord but it's because there's only 2-4 of us, too small for a game. We have a code of honor though where we only speak during discussion rounds and make sure to type in the chat the things we suspect.
                            Pretty much the same for us but we talk the whole time about non game related stuff and talk game stuff during votes. No reason to stay silent might as well have a convo.
            That literally just happened to me. Nobody said anything and all of a sudden everyone voted me.
        Maybe you and your buddy play like that but i don't know if you have some sort of honour system or a cheating system going on.

Literally the only time anyone ever mentions being on discord in among us is to inform who the imposter was by speaking to their buddy. If you don't do that then I'll never know you are on discord and you wont ket kicked.
if it happens in a lobby i'm in, i just say "vote kick them out of the game for cheating, and their friend"
I have still yet to see that happen
Ban em. I kicked one and they came right back. Didn't notice until the game started again. Now I just ban one of them.
Public lobbies are messed up
Or when everyone is on discord but you and start voting without saying anything.
𝘌𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘺𝘰𝘯𝘦 𝘭𝘪𝘬𝘦𝘥 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵
Stop Playing public lobbies and join official discord’s, game is so much more enjoyable
    Some people dont have friends or are too shy to join a discord
There was a brother and sister I presume who made a lobby themselves to cheat and I’m like wtf?

Called them bitches and left
    As is the standard practice, of course.
        I've had this a lot...
        Yes
    I played with people like that and when they claimed I killed their sister I just said he was simping and trying to cover the fact that he is imposter
        Lmao
        I had a husband-wife playing that were cool until one was imp and the other wasn’t. Came down to the 3 of us, with wife killing #4 in front of us. Husband covers for her anyway. So not cool.
    Damn, was that my kids (8 and 10)? I gave them an earful after realizing what was going on.
        Damn, I wish my parents played video games with me when I was younger.
        Idk tbh

It was a random game and hey were blue and white
    dayum.
    Hate when people do that, I make lobby’s with my sister, but we ignore each other except for when we can use the chat and talk to everyone and never say anything we shouldn’t
    My wife and I play in the same room, the second the match starts to when it’s over we are silent. I don’t get why people cheat on this game
    Lol they’re probably kids or something why are you calling them bitches

Like I get leaving once you realize what’s going on but you don’t have to be a dick too. If anything just send a message that says “please don’t cheat” or something like that

Edit: my point is you can call them out without being a total asshole about it lmao maybe talk to them before “calling them bitches and leaving” bc that accomplishes literally nothing
        >  If anything just send a message that says “please don’t cheat” or something like that

Is this your first online game or what
            I’m just saying you can approach it without being a dick
            [https://youtu.be/wTuhMUja7us](https://youtu.be/wTuhMUja7us)
        We makes mistakes in the heat of ANGER Jimbo
        Yeah saying please don’t cheat is so helpful
        If they’re such little pussies that they can actively ruin peoples fun but can’t take getting called a bitch because of it then they can get off the computer and go hop on the youtube kids app on their ipad and watch some metrosexual weirdo with purple hair play the game completely curse free.
            Sounds like you’re having a heated gamer moment
                im gonna say it
                    the gamer word
                        MRS OBAMA, GET DOWN
        This entire subreddit is 15 year olds 

You’re talking to a child
            This implies we're all children now

I'm afraid
                This is terrible news for my spouse.
        Kids need to learn that cheating is bad and wrong. We need a newer, stronger word for cheating in among us.
        [removed]
    So my SO and I play together. If 1 of us is the imposter we let each other know. The other doesnt add anything to the chat and doesnt defend themselves or the imp.

If we are both crewmates. We identify that and go about our mission. If one of us gets killed you might hear "gosh darn saggy balls" "u ded?" "...ya" and dont identify the killer.

Still fun and able to connect with my SO fairly.
    I had this happen with cousins
        That’s fucking hot bro
[deleted]
    And then they’ll be back at it next game. Really don’t understand the hesitation in kicking.
I use discord for civil talk when in Pubs, I don't cheat, we just use it as faster forms of communication while telling the people not in our call what we think. Again, we don't say who killed each other. Is that ok?
    This has been the norm for years.  In games where info is important and have a separate dead chat, if you get killed you don't talk about how on outside comms, or at least until everyone is dead or end of round.
    Yes Mr. Cake man
    Yeah honestly, I play it where I often have 5 friends in discord then fill with random, but we don't cheat. If important info gets relayed in discord we post it in the chat too and also if any of us dies we don't say anything in discord, like its supposed to be.

Though I suppose it wouldn't make much sense for a 5 person discord to cheat because we mostly want to play against each other and that would spoil it for everyone.
    I dunno. The odds of you being able to type out all of the info you said out loud is unlikely.

But it's not as bad as people who do this, *don't* type anything, and then just vote without a word.
    Why? That’s just redundant
The game doesn't even track stats. There's no point to padding your win loss. Just have fun, jeez.
    Technically it does track stats but not publicly, so there are no bragging rights included.
        Well if the stats aren't public who cares? It's a black box, if nobody can see em there's no reason to think about them
people who cheat-cheat (double kills, insta vote, skip vote, etc) must have an extra special place then.
Amen
Cheating in among us makes no sense. At least in other games with experience or a battle pass there is a tangible benefit. 

This has no value other than being a dick.

*The deepest pit of hell has opened to swallow you whole so don’t keep the devil waiting~~, old friend~~*
    I'm sorry EnderSkoom
    Ayyy, exactly what I thought
So far I've only played with friends in discord and the only time we've ever done anything like this was when it was obvious that an imposter and crewmate were working together (An example, I was killed, I didn't say anything to my team until I saw my killer kill someone else right in front of a confirmed crewmate then hop into a vent, then the confirmed crewmate claimed that he was with him and didn't kill anyone. )

Outside of that, it's bullshit when people use discord like that.
Or hosts who kick ppl who vote them out as an imp
    Y e s. This. I got kicked from a lobby after making friends and being friendly withe everyone, then when I said it was the host (I think he was like lime or smthn, doesn't really matter) and he got voted out, it was him, then he kicks me from the lobby for voting him out. Like what.
And people wonder why I don't allow mics at ALL, even during emergency meetings.
I sister keeps on telling me who she is when I play with her on mobile and keeps on asking for me to tell her my role. It’s stupidly annoying.
and what is even the point of a win?  You can't even see any stats about how good you are.
I don't understand the point. The game revolves around the imposter being a secret.

What purpose is there in playing if it's not?
The community has 3 types of players. 

1: public lobbies following the rules  
2: private lobbies using discord to chat with friends during meetings     
 3:privte lobbies using discord to talk and yell the entire time "if I die I'm with red"
[deleted]
    Because it’s blatant cheating? The whole point of the game is to figure out who the imposter is through detective work. If your friend is telling you who it is, both of you are cheating and ruining the game for everyone else.
        [deleted]
            No, the dead can’t actually talk to the living in the game. They can see what the living are saying, but the dead can only talk to each other.

If the dead could tell who killed them, the game would be over really quickly, and the imposters would lose 99% of the time.
                That makes perfect sense, cool. Definitely glad I picked it up, it looks really fun
                    Let me give you a tip: Search for a discord with an active playerbase rather quickly.

It'll be much better than random players (more logical conclusions, less random voting, less cheaters)
you can’t kick during discussion anyway
    You can but everyone has to vote to kick them
When I'm in discord even if we know who it i,we don't vote them or anything without real evidence.
Imagine cheating in a game where the fun comes in the unknown

        Yeah so everybody compliments how smart you are.
            [deleted]
                One time I had a game where someone was cheating and they thought that was how you were supposed to play. I also had one where there were these 2 people just holding the lobby hostage cause one was imposter and there was 3 people.
                    Among us public servers suck, just play it with friends or find a lobby on discord servers.
                        Aye, since if no-one's cheating, you can't report anything.
"Hi so I saw black venting" (he was)
*instantly voted off*
                    The people in your first example were probably young children. Like when you play 100% luck boardgames with them and you're like "Wow you're really good in this game" and they really believe they have skill in rolling the dice, that's how old they probably were.
                Thats why my username is Big PP so people know before hand.
        That way you can climb the leaderboards and unlock all the best armor.
    Imagine cheating in a game where there are absolutely no benefits to winning
    Imagine cheating
        Cheating single-player is fine, godmode with explosive bullets in far cry 5 is so fun. Multi-player cheating ruins it for everyone.
            Facts
    Imagine cheating on your girl
    Some people don't care about fun, they care about winning at any cost
You know what's worse? Cheating on games that have no consequences. Literally 0. I could understand if it had a leader board or unlocks or a ranking system or level ups or stats but this game literally doesn't have any of this as of now. There is no incentive to play aside from having fun.

Why people do this is beyond me.
    Yes and it's also the worst when you call them out for cheating and they're just like "lol you're getting butt hurt over a game" or "I didn't realize you could cheat in this game"
    It's just people who lose all the time and are salty about it so they get their power trip by cheating. They also say things like "everyone hacks anyways" so they can rationalize how badly they play.
    I joined a game where one person had hacked the game to make themself the imposter every time and set it to instantly kill the other 9 players simultaneously as soon as the game started and they were doing it over and over... I was just like what’s the point? Like if there was a leaderboard ok but they were just waiting for the lobby to fill every time to win in one second
    Because the game is full of kids and kids are stupid
    They have fun by hurting others.
I got ejected the other day because the other imposter didn’t have time to play anymore so he called an emergency meeting and told everyone that we were the two imposters and then left the game. I had already survived one round of voting and killed two crewmates. Literally nobody suspected me

Edit: am I The only one who constantly gets in games with people following around other characters saying “I love you” in chat and asking for their Snapchat?
    Send them to horny jail
        *B O N K*
    [deleted]
        Wtf is that about? There was a guy who was following around one of the other players never did a single task and repeatedly would only say in chat shit like 

“I love you white” “ I love white” “i’m in love with white” 

I bailed on the lobby because this Dingus was just deadweight and like 10 minutes later I ended up in another lobby were somebody else was doing the same thing except he kept saying “I fucked pink”
    > Edit: am I The only one who constantly gets in games with people following around other characters saying “I love you” in chat and asking for their Snapchat?

Not snapchat, but I had someone praising me for being good and asking for my discord.
        Yeah I seem to keep finding these people who follow a character around and keep saying “ what’s your snap?/Can I have your snap?/Snap please”
Or hacking in a party game like fall guys
Cheatings wrong but i wish i could toggle never being imposter. Ive gotten many imposter wins but it just gives me so much anxiety.

    Lol the last game I played someone said the saw me vent but I wasn’t an imposter and they weren’t either... I was like wtf why??
        Sometimes you see a vent animation and then you see someone. Sometimes you mistake someone's colour because they're wearing a suit. Sometimes your brain plays tricks with you. Shit happens.
            They were standing right next to me in caf with nobody else and we weren’t by a vent so idk 🤷‍♀️
                He was probably 9 years old and thought it was funny.
        Occasionally I’ll get lag where people blip in and out of existence. If that happens when you’re over a vent, I could see how a new player might think it was a venting.
        I played a game today where I couldn't find lime anywhere. I ran around the whole map and didn't see them, everyone else was done in cams. So I called a meeting. Said they were sus, they got voted and were an impostor. Then I saw orange do shields but there was no animation so I knew they faked it but I was out of meeting calls
        People do that all the time.  Had someone walk away from a deadbody and I reported it and they said it must be me.  We voted them off and they were innocent.  Its like whyyy??
    I haven't played the game but is saying you saw them vent (if they actually did) a valid reason? Or is that cheating like this post?
        [deleted]
    Oh that shits infuriating. I was imposter and walked my ass to security to watch some people and someone called a meeting and said I vented. Nothing I could do would change those peoples minds so I got ejected.
    I always say that ("I saw red vent"), when for example, I see them doing a common task that nobody has.
        Why not just say tht then if they kick red and hes not imp theyre gonna kick u and then ur down 2 ppl
            Cause public people don't understand common tasks
                But its not the same as venting at all calling out  a vent is supposed to be 100% because u saw then vent. Common tasks arent 100% proof
"if not red vote me next"
    That's the worst.  It's the confidence that sells it.

If it's a two imp game I normally type out something like "God dammit Gary (even if they're not Gary IRL), why are you such a little bitch?!  Hey all, he's the other imp."
        I try to sell it with fake salt.  "Man I ALWAYS get caught when I'm imp!  Screw this game!  Gray is other impo.  Fuck this."  I don't do it every time but any time you're solidly identified as imp right off the top it's an avenue for advantage.  Can't tell you how many times I've seen a group react to that with like 2 crew drops and then a vote to eject a crew member.
    Ughhh I hate this! And “not me, I have scan/trash”
    And then nobody votes them next
    [deleted]
“He said Shhh at the beginning”
Or cheating with mods.  This happened to me:
Guy runs into security where I am playing the fool, then goes sprinting out to call emergency meeting.

"It's yellow, I saw them vent into security.". Me-"that's a complete lie.  Clearly hacking since I haven't vented or killed anyone"
    I play on mobile, and I have had something similar happen almost every time I'm impostor. Don't kill or vent someone pushes the button and knows who both impostors are
    I'm upset to see these people out here.
This is the fucking worst because everyone else is like “they probably saw them. Just vote.”
Trust
I had some saying exacly what happened, that they were told on discord etc.
And they would not accept that this was cheating.
I was told I should view it like the imposter was seen when he killed.
I would have killed them in real life if I have had the chance.
How, though?

        Link Steam account would be pretty easy
            The only problem with that is a lot of people play on mobile and not everyone has a steam account. Maybe they could have multiple options like steam, Google, facebook, instagram, etc.
                Steam app on phone. But yeah, all the login options are good, so do all of them XD
                    You’re an idiot.
                    Not everyone has a steam account or wants one. The game is very popular among normal people aswell.
                You can have a steam account without owning a pc. And steam has a mobile app.
                    I know but how many people do you think are going to go out and make a steam account just to play among us
            "easy"

You are clearly not a developer. Linking steam is not convenient for the developer. 

For the user? Yes. It's awesome.

For developers it is hell on Earth getting that shit to work
    They could probably add subtitles to the account? Cheater title for anyone who does this a certain number of times. And if they persist have a repeat offender title.
        Make them be the color cream and where the word shame around their necks.
        And what would check if they cheated? Manual review? AI? Both solutions are very unlikely to happen for a *3 people dev team.*
    [I proposed a solution on a post that got largely ignored.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmongUs/comments/j96eca/i_propose_we_rename_the_game_to_quiting_simulator/g8hpcun/) I think it would end the problem at least mitigate it. There is no need to make accounts , but steam games can store your id. And that would make punishments like this increasingly bad.
        Much like the Low Priority Queue that Dota 2 uses. If you quit X amount of games you get placed into the LPQ and have to finish a number of games in that queue to be released back into the wild. If you’re in the LPQ you can’t team up with friends and play ranked until you’re out and you also don’t gain any rank when playing LPQ a games.
            I actually thought of this concept for fixing Among Us and didn’t know it already existed. Cool!
                The only downside to it in Dota is that it’s pretty harsh so if you have a few accidental disconnects in a row you’re stuck in a queue with the most toxic people in the game until you get out. But I’d much rather pay that price for accidental inclusion than let it go unpunished lol.
                    Dota is much higher stakes than Among Us isn't it? I think Among Us could have a system that just measures your average against the global average. If your rank is within the upper standard deviation, then you're good, so a few random disconnects shouldn't matter as long as you have a good track record of finishing games. In Dota it probably needs to be more strict because I imagine people would be selling their "good rep" accounts, though I don't imagine people doing that for Among Us.
    IP ban. Then hey have to use a different device or wifi network to play. Kids who use discord to cheat almost certainly don’t have a VPN so bypass is unlikely
    ip address or sum. that’s how growtopia did it. no one could play at my house lmao
        When Valve first introduced trust factor into CSGO people were reporting kow trust because of shares IPs (valve didnt confirm if it was true or not) where people in university or somewhere with a large group of people living together would all have low trust because someone else on that same ip had been banned before.

    I like how they think that banning you is some kind of threat or punishment. 

Dude, if you’re going to be that way then I’m going to be leaving the lobby on my own after the game is over.
just leave and find a new lobby it’s not that serious
But purple still cheated and the game is pretty much ruined
    Nah, nah. Eject purple and let the impostor win. Purple will probably ragequit. If they don’t, ban them.
        You assume the cheaters don’t make their own lobby’s
            [deleted]
                I was in a lobby, killed someone with lights out and no one else around and their friend hit the emergency button and said “it’s purple I saw them kill and vent!”

I didn’t vent so I knew they were lying. I accused them of cheating and when the round ended we were back in the lobby. I asked “how did you see me?” And the host kicked me. I joined right back in and asked again “I’m sorry, you must have hit the wrong button by accident. How did you see me? There was no one around when I killed them.”

They responded by banning me. I was just hoping to get a confession that they were cheating but didn’t dignify that with a response. Oh well, I joined another lobby with people that actually played correctly
                Idk, I always host the lobby and people still join and cheat all the time
                I only play among us on the discord now
                Pretty sure if enough people vote to kick the host it still works. 

Gotta do it in game though
                My gf and I host our own lobby and cheaters still join.

The good news is, once you ban 1, the others usually leave too.
        Wow I never thought of this
        Still ruins the game.  
Just hopefully ruins it for the cheater more.
        Game still ruined no matter what you do. It's so frustrating when you finally get imposter and some cheating fuck ruins it
[deleted]
I wish I could blacklist them. Never see games hosted by them, they never see games hosted by me and if they are in a game I can see it is red before joining.
Don't forget to also kick the dead guy who told purple
Also the game is so popular now that a lot of young kids/teens are playing and don't know/don't care about the etiquette of it. So one person cheats and the younger ones go along with it because they don't know who else to vote for. 

So it's not just that randoms suck, it's that some are literally children.
    That’s the story of any popular game tbf. Small game gets popular, attracts little kids, they ruin it for the other players.
        Hey I’m a kid and I play fairly and don’t randomly vote someone just cos someone else did😢 I hate it when other ppl just vote off somebody just cos one person voted even tho he didn’t say anything😒
Im pretty dumb but, wouldn't you have a 1/5 chance since with 1 imp there is a 1/10 and a 2/10 chance with 2 imps, and we shorten the 2/10 down to a 1/5.
Correct me if im wrong. (:
    Lol, I wasn’t trying to put in actual math figures, I was more using 1/20 more as an embellishment because it feels like that sometimes. Your math is right though.
        Ohhh i understand, yea i does feel really like you never get imp and when the chance is 20% its so wierd.
            That's entirely valid. Statistics say:

Over a large number of games, your observed number of impostor games should end up near 1/5, coming closer to 1/5 the more games you played.

But on the other hand, streaks are possible. There is still a (4/5)^n chance that your next n games will be crewmate. That's still n=1 80%, n=2 64%, 51%, 40%, 32%, .... So yeah, for a sequence of 3 games, it's just a coin flip to gain imposter once and it's quite likely to be crew "all the time". Especially because you remember things you dislike better.
                I have a friend who only plays like 3 games and quits if hes not imposter by the 3rd game. So weve played 4 times and hes not been imposter and complains about it.

Hes like "well thats the 12th game without imposter". Yeah but you also dont really give it a chance to be imposter. Im fairly certain if he played all the rounds we played in a row, he wouldve been imposter atleast once. If you play 3 and quit, odds technically dont change but its like leaving one slot machine for another, its like theres a reset.
            Well the thing is it is a chance, it is totally possible that you just have a ton of rounds where you are not impostor or a ton of rounds where you are always impostor. It has to be completely random unfortunately.
                True. Flip a coin 100 times, and in those flips you statistically would have had 7 heads or 7 tails in a row at some point. Tell a person to estimate a coin flip 100 times, and they probably wont do seven in a row at any point. 

People are really bad at imagining randomness
                I was thinking about a way to improve on pure randomness. This way would require all players to make accounts.

A raffle system would work.

You could give each player account an extra ticket for every non imposter game they play out, and reset it when they play imposter. Give out negative chance to be imposter to punish quitting early for folks who just want to play imposter and quit every game they aren't.

So if you've played imposter last game or never played the game before, you have 10 tickets in the pool. In a ten person game that's the 10% baseline. But if you've played 5 non-imp games in a row you have 15 tickets.

Every game you quit, you lose a ticket for 24 hours. A strategy to ban quitter accounts and use cooldowns for accounts on quitter IPs could be implemented to beat people just trying to use 20 accounts to get around the restriction.

Streakiness is reduced and quitters are punished.
                I played for four hours straight and didn't get impostor once. I should have recorded it. Probably set a record. Was playing 2 impostor lobbies as well.
    I have played 30 games straight without getting imposter once.
    Well yes but actually no
    But each games is it's own 1 or 2 out of 10.

Flipping a coin 100 times and they could all land heads. Doesn't meant the chance isnt still 50/50.
Honestly this game is broken for me now. between discord cheaters and people who leave because they weren't imposter, I haven't had a decent game in about a week now. Ah well, fun while it lasted
    I have never played Among Us but have been entertained by watching people play in private games who clearly respect the rules. I knew from watching it that playing public games would be a complete waste of time as it’s just wide open to cheaters. Unfortunately the lowest common denominator will always fuck up the honour system for everyone else.
        I’ve found that watching the settings can help get better games. Cheaters and people that drop because they didn’t get imposter tends to prefer really unbalanced settings. 

Some of my best games have been one off public servers. Having friends in discord makes it more fun to play for 5 hours straight, but they start to learn your play style and that makes it harder as imposter.
        Honestly, most games are not as filled with cheaters as some would have you believe. It does happen and will happen to you, but I wouldn't say I run into that every day. I have 10ish hours of playtime and ran into that maybe 3 or 4 times.

The actual common one that happens in, what feels like half the games, is 1-2 people leaving right at the start because they didn't get impostor. That stings, because IF you have a 10/10 full lobby and that happens, you pretty much need to vote one of the impostors out in that first meeting. If it wasn't a full lobby, or if 3 people quit, you might as well all quit and join a new lobby.

All of the games issues go away when you play with a group of friends though. The game is definitely best enjoyed with friends, or at least in a Discord call of rule-abiding people
        It was fine in the beginning, but it's gotten completely out of control recently. Just uninstalled
        I recommend joining the r/AmongUs discord and playing over voice chat. Sure, you encounter cheaters and bad sports once in a while, but the game quality is 10x better than playing over text imo.
    Well if it helps, I’ve heard there’s an among us discord server you could join and find people to play with, that way you don’t have to deal with all the crap you usually deal with in Public lobbies
    I find it best to at least have two other friends. Best if it's 5-6. You find decent randoms pretty quickly, who we invite to the discord... rinse and repeat each night someone plays. Once the room is full with decent people, all of this bullshit is unnecessary.

        Yeah this is big brain time
I cant imagine buying this game and only playing publics
    I only play public when my group is offline. I wish my group was on more.
    I only play public (I’m on the free mobile version) because I can’t get my friends to play and the ones who do are on different work schedules than me so if I want to play it’s public or bust. If I don’t like a game or I can tell it’s discord run then I leave and find a new one! I’ve had a lot of fun actually in some public ones.
        Same. I mainly play on Mira now too. I just want a quick 10 minutes of fun between work assignments throughout the day. Public is the easiest. If I hate a lobby, I bounce.
        Join any of the public discords (some are full, but new ones always pop up. It took me about 15 mins to find one that worked). It's the same random lobby type experience but when everyone has to actually talk to each other you get a lot fewer people ruining the game.
    I could only stand the garbage of public lobbies for 20 minutes before rage quitting. I only play when my friends are online now sadly
    If you don't have discord and aren't used to it, it feels kinda daunting to figure out at first. I powered through it this week so I could find lobbies and I'm so glad I did
    I don't have friends
        Theres plenty of discord servers for matchmaking if you're on PC
            Yeah true but I'm too lazy for that lmfaoooo
EL5, there's another way to play besides public lobbies? Help a brother out? I feel so old
    You gotta join a dedicated among us discord. There is an official Innersloth discord but I heard it's full. But there are plenty private ones, just ask on the subreddit or sth. Playing eith randoms is cancer, dont do it to your blood pressure.
    This subreddit has a discord.

Download discord and make an account. Do all the activation stuff. Follow the link in the sidebar to go to the server.

Do the reaction in the main thread then you can access the LFG (looking for game) threads. There, people post links to games that need a player where you can join and do voice chat. They also have no mic LFG lobbies if you want the silent experience.

Trust, I felt old too trying to figure this out.
Same here. The discord cheater was the host, so when I called her on the cheating (the rest of the group voted me out) I just got kicked.  What a cun.t.
    This just happened to me! I hate being the impostor, but I was doing a little better. (I just started playing and I’m not sneaky) I finally made a kill and they had suspected everyone but me... and someone says “I’m on the phone with them and it’s [me].” It was the room host so I left the game. Just when I was starting to get better at being imp they ruined it for me.
        Oh they don't just ruin it for the imposter, they ruin the game for everyone.  No matter what happens (play it out or quit) the game is wasted.
            Exactly! I had played another room where there were 2 cousins on the phone and they kept it pretty fair from what I can remember. This was my first encounter with cheating that blatant, and it definitely deflated the fun.
I joined a random lobby today and 10 seconds in an emergency meeting was called. Without a spoken word from any of the other players, they voted me off. Every single person. 

Wasn't even the imposter either
    oh crap I think that was my discord group. my bad dude. I kept telling them that we shouldn’t make the server public because it’s annoying and randoms hate it. for some reason, they insisted.
Thank you lol, figured changing the font color was easier on the eyes than making a cheap phone edit to have Bernie be cyan
That's something that only an imposter would say!
    :)  :D
I've seen cheaters who actually seem proud of it, like wtf are they thinking
I don't get it! There is no reward for winning! Why cheat?
    To feel powerful.

That's literally all they need and is the reason why most are cheating. Not to pad some statistic, they know it's fake. It's only to dominate others most of the time.
    bc they're kids who are too young to understand why they are playing what they are playing and too dumb to play the game legitimately, so they feel the need to cheat to "win". saves them the brain power of actually having to determine who the impostor is genuinely.
That's a good point, but as someone said, randoms vote pretty quickly and don't listen to alibis or defenses.
Happy cakeday!

I had people running around for SIX MINUTES and 2/3 task bars full. Third guy did no tasks... Impostor wanted us to win but the stupid player actively didn't do any tasks.
    [deleted]
        Played ina  discord server last night and kept getting voted out because I would finish my tasks first and late game people would ask me to do a task to prove I'm a crewmate. Like bitch, it takes 4 minutes to do 5 tasks its not my fault you guys don't know how to play.
    If that guy wasnt the host then the host should have kicked him so they had a chance of winning
> So you have to throw your imposter game, sus out discord users then ban them when you get back to the lobby. 

This sounds like a meta Among Us game. :D
    There are 2 cheaters among us
Because it's literally a 2 year old game that only got popular in the last 2 months. Things take time to implement mate.
White was the one I killed
I hope you went and voted too!
    I did. Also maxed donations and was on his texting team. Still didn't matter :(
        I am so jaded now. I just don't care anymore. We are ruled by corrupt cynics, and lobbyists for big oil and the arms dealers trying to make a quick buck. 

Whatever, we're all gonna be dead in 100 years from climate change anyways, may as well try to enjoy my life while I can instead of parasocially obsessing over shit I have no control over. I'm trying to cut out politics from my media diet, and it bothers me how prominent it is on Reddit, it makes me consider leaving the site. It is like taking a weed whacker to your mental health.
            Sounds like a good response. Be sure to take care of yourself first for sure.
        It absolutely mattered you need to lose that mindset man, had bernie not campaigned as hard as he did and made it as far as he did this platform would look a lot different.  You're effort and work forced concessions and made compromises and that's the cornerstone to democracy.

It reminds me of a quote by a shitty super scientist it is heavy-handed in its brow beating but the message rings true:


"I get it I suddenly get it you're children. That's why my dad put you in the pool and made you duke it out. News flash: my dad was a shitty parent! But when my boys cry about Fairness I remind them that fairness is the philosophical Tooth Fairy! There is no fairness!  

You won't get everything but you will get something, enough with this fairness crap and make some compromises and you get to go home to your friends in their costumes and brag about how much you got em', or you can go back and go "oh we didn't get everything we wanted so we took nothing."
            Until I see any change, I will keep my mindset. We don't have time to take babysteps to appease corrupt CEOs and the selfish moronic masses. People are dying and the earth is getting hotter. 

And I dont trust Biden to make any meaningful changes. If he does great, glad I voted for him. But im not holding my breath.  Let's hope there is a world for your kids to enjoy.

Global warming doesn't give a shit about your concessions. All the species now extinct dont give a shit about compromises. Thousands upon thousands dying due to lack of Healthcare shouldn't be told "hey cheer up, we made some headway!". Catering to selfish assholes is not progress. Progress is progress.
                You already made the compromise you voted for him becuase you saw him as the better choice of the two at some level you do understand the need for compromise for progress to move forward.  I know you're angry and it's justified we're in deep shit but I'm sorry you need to grow the fuck up if you think compromise doesn't lead to progress. 

A political minority has no right to try to and bowl over everyone else to just thier style of thinking.  You want to come to the table?  You better be willing to give as much as you take.
                    Lol, we already cater to the minority. Republicans. 

And you need to grow up if you think the last 40 years of compromise has lead to meaning progress. Sure, guys can marry now, but what else. How is the money difference between rich and poor any better. How many people have been saved by lasting Healthcare that wasn't immediately overturned.  

If you want to roll over and show your belly cause it makes you feel better fine, but don't try and act like we are making progress. Once your grow up and learn something you will see how only one side is compromising. 

In a working country yes compromise works and leads to progress. America is not a functioning country by any metric.
                        Hey outside of our argument I peeped your profile and I apologize for misgendering you in the second reply and rectified the problem won't happen again.

And compromise isn't showing your belly and it's that exact mentality that leads others to think compromise is a bad word.  Look no further then virginia to see where small incremental change led to a blue virginia.  Shit sucks and I'm sorry it's not fixed right now this second BUT I will not support a movement who claims to have all the answers to fix all our problems and is unwilling to compromise with people.  That's what we got right now and I just really don't think it's as simple as: the other guy has all the answers.
        Well i meant i hope you voted for Biden. I am a bernie supporter too but my main goal right now is get trump out of office
            Agreed
Some people are desperate for a win
I think its a cover for cheaters. It almost has to be. I had someone do that when I didn't vent into a room and wasn't standing near the vent. Of course they were right, because I just killed across the map and booked it
This is the best idea I’ve seen on here. If you select that option, you’ll also be placed into a random lobby based on your preferences (that way friends can’t find the same game in their search somehow)
Nah check the time stamps. The bot even notified me that it was reposted there
K
The game is $5 dude, just play with friends.
    We all have vastly different schedules so even when we do play together we still have to play with randos who cheat.
        There's like hundreds of discord servers for Among Us out there which you can join and most semi-decently sized ones can get a full lobby within 5-30min, depending on your luck.
Join a discord group and play
    That's not an option for everyone
        Uhhhh, yes it is?
        Why?
        [deleted]
        Just join the r/amongus discord or the Among Us LFG discord
The majority of people who doesnt have friends
    Oh, sad.
Cause not all of us has friends that play the game
People have started doing this, and lying, just to ruin the game.

Just this morning, I was one of two impostors. I killed blue first, and lime starts spewing out “I’m friends with blue and he told me black did it!!!!” even though black was definitely not an impostor. 

We voted out lime and he left after cussing up a storm and telling us to kill ourselves, but the game was still ruined because people still suspected black based on lime’s baseless accusation. Combined with the standard 1-2 people leaving as soon as the game starts, by the end it was just too easy of a win and not fun at all for anyone.

After the game, blue said that he had no idea who lime was, so that idiot was literally just there to ruin other people’s fun. Fucking douchebag.
    [deleted]
        From what I understand the dev is working on an account system exactly so they can ban people like that.
            Idk how it isn’t a thing already. I get this has been a smaller game for the past couple years and there was probably just a code of honor in place, but I’ve played enough Gmod to know how much of a problem meta gaming and ghosting can be.
                You don't always foresee these type of issues..
                    You shouldn't have to plan around the lowest common denominator...but we do.

If people can fuck something up, there's some asshole out there willing to try
                    Happy cake day
                they were intending the game for groups of friends mostly. who may even be on a couch together. and the online play was a bit of an afterthought, afaik. so they never thought that would be such a problem
        Petition for this bruh! Where should I sign
    The innersloth official discord has rooms for among us, negating this problem
    The worst part is the fact he tried to tell your group to kill themselves. That messed up and it should be a crime
        It actually is, at least where I’m from
            Welp now we have a reason to arrest that douchebag
    if he was imposter it would have been alright ,but he wasnt
That’s when everyone needs to be on the same page. Continue playing without voting anyone off and without reporting bodies. Everyone tries to finish their tasks without getting killed
    Still ruined.

I also like twitch.
                No one likes Twitch. It's a terrible blight. 

Anyways, gotta go. My Twitch stream starts in 5 minutes!
            Most streamers I watch play the game turn their chats on emote only when they are playing and they go back to regular text chats when they are in the lobbies
            *Laughs in emote only
        Username sounds very familiar...


...János.
        Not necessarily. Just turn it into Alien vs Crewmate.
(Hide and Seek, https://youtu.be/abYgE5TdOm0)
        Not ruined if u turn it into hide and seek
    Whats even the point then
        It keeps the game going without completely ruining it for the poor bastard that finally got imposter after probably waiting over an hour
            But why continue. All the fun of the game is lost even if it is a shame that the imposter was revealed by a cheat
                Because then it becomes a different game. Plenty of folks play variations like this anyway.
                    Yes but the entire premise is to find the imposter and everyone knows who the imposter is then why would you play? It's not gonna be hard for the imposter to just kill everyone if they deliberately don't vote him off. Just end the match, kick the cheat and move on to the next one lmfao
                        It turns into hide and seek which is actually pretty fun. The entire point is knowing the seeker/imposter and avoiding them while doing tasks at the same time. It kinda becomes dead by daylight in a way.
                            Would be good to have a "hide-and-seek" voting option down next to skip.  When this sort of thing happens and a majority vote hide-and-seek the game changes modes, reduces vision and increases movement speed for crewmates (and the inverse for imposter), reduces kill timer, disables the emergency button and reporting, and away you go.
                            I applaud the duck out of you guys who don’t let a cheater ruin your gaming experience.
                        The premise is to NOT BE KILLED, not to find the imposter.  That is why you can easily win games (if everyone isn’t a dumbass) by doing your tasks.  

The objective is to live and get your team out of that area, not to necessarily find the imposter.
                            EvErYoNe WhO dOeSn'T PlAy LiKe I dO iS a DuMbAsS....

The objective is to have fun, it's a game.  Winning easily isn't always the route one would want to take.  Others disagree.
                        No the point is to get all the tasks done or eject the imposter.
                I wouldn’t say it’s lost. It can still be fun that way considering it’ll become more of a hide & seek from that point forward. It sucks that it was ruined, but that’s an easy way to salvage the game
Happened to me once and they didn't wanted to vote me cuz felt bad :((( 

Still made them vote me so we can play another one
I had a really fun game where I was imposter. Other imposter got caught and named me before he was voted off. Everyone understood, and just pretended they didn’t know. 
It got really obvious near the end I was just killing whoever and everyone was ignoring the bodies.
    That’s so fucked. Sorry that game was ruined.
        But that’s the thing, we didn’t let them ruin the game. We just had fun with it.
You're supposed to mute your mic between meetings. Playing like they are is ruining the game.
your good for that dude
Precisely why I like playing with confirm off. The stakes are much higher not having any real argument.
    I wont because I'm not a dick, but I want to start faking being in Discord with someone. I mostly play solo. So I join a game with confirms off. When I'm impostor, just be like [dead color] told me [alive color] did it. We are in Discord. I'd be flat out lying, but everyone just believes that shit. I'm so tempted to try it.
        I would say to only use it after someone else has said it.  
  
"Red told me Yellow killed him through Discord!"

"What are you talking about? Red just told me it was you who killed him, how could you lie about that!"
            That's a good one!
            Ooh, I like it.  Countering with their own shit.  Might buy some time, and even if the metagaming guy was crew and correct that yellow was imposter he deserves to get spaced anyway for metagaming
        May as well. Not like most random lobbies have players with an attention span longer than 15 seconds with confirm on. “White was not an imposter “ - “welp, guess we’ll just forget red fully lied about seeing him kill yellow.”

Win so many games as imposter that way.
            That just leads to "vote them and if not vote me" argument which is also stupid. Suiciding as an impostor is great if there are multiples. 

Imagine there are 2 impostors. You get caught in a kill and get a crewmember vented before you and you just took out at least 2 people. That leaves the other impostor 6v1, which isnt great, but not bad given how quickly some other random impostors get murdered.

Now imagine you take out before you suicide vent, your teammate and you take out 4 people. Then plus the vented crewmember you used "vote them and if not vote me" on, your lone teammate is at a 1v4. I really like those odds if I'm the lone impostor.
                That’s why I just do “I saw them kill x right in front of me.” Just as soon as the chat box comes up. With 2 imposters and no confirm I can make it work at least twice.

But I used the “saw them kill right in front of me” tactic 9v1 with confirm on and the one guy who stuck around too call a meeting after ejecting an innocent was the next victim. Next meeting was down to 3 and there was no accusation even leveled resulting in a skip vote. Had the other two remembered 5 minutes prior I would have lost.
                    I was 1v3 and got seen killing. Blamed the other guy, saying "if not him then vote me next." 1v2, I'm hoping I can get the last kill before they can call the meeting. Right after, I check the meeting cooldown, it's 3 seconds shorter than my kill cooldown. Crap, I just lost. Except the 2 dumbasses immediately run off to do missions. Okay, I'll wait by the button and sabotage 02. As soon as they clear the emergency, I duck down to admin for the win.  
Like come on.. See the bigger picture. You know I'm the only imposter and I only need one more kill. If you call the meeting, you win. If my cooldown is shorter, you lose. If you don't hit the #@&$ button, you lose!
        Yea people get all on about honor and stuff in this game trying to play it like fucking sherlock holmes. Nah go full puppet master, just claim people are faking tasks, say "vote me out if I'm wrong" then next time around self report and urgently blame someone else.
        i did somthing similar once by fake ratting out the other imposter ,of sadly the innocent who i blamed got really mad and i got kicked after the game
        I play like this tbh, and it's pretty effective. I haven't tried the "I'm in discord, it's him" claim yet, but I'm definitely going too now. The big one I like doing is fake snitching on my other impostor when I'm blatantly busted. Like 2 people see me kill on cams, so I know I'm going out the airlock, but I'll fake being salty about it, pick a quiet crew member, claim they're an idiot and not helping me, and say to eject them too. %60 of the time it works every time, especially if my real other impostor isn't sus and piles on.

EDIT: You shouldn't even feel like a dick playing like this either. The point of being impostor is to mess with crew to throw sus off you, and anything goes that way. Lying about being in discord with a dead guy isn't any different then lying about not killing them in the first place.
        What I can tell you is after seeing a bunch of butthurt imposters get caught call out the other imposters in chat before they get ejected, I've started doing the same.

Except I call out some random innocent guy, and so far 100% of the time that guy will get immediately ejected. I feel bad about it but was hoping to spread doubt in the community of just believing these dickheads. 

So go for it. They will absolutely eject them without a second thought because most people are idiots.
Chaotic good
One startegy I do is "*killed person* is my friend, I'm in a discord call with them, they told me it's *random person I decide to accuse*".

Doesn't really work because I play with a group of friends over discord, but it's the thought that counts.
    This was my idea and I play as a solo. I'd feel bad about "ruining" a game, even though I'm just fake ruining it. But I want to see how many times everyone would believe me lol
        Exact same problem here. I only do it as a joke among my friends because I'm too scared to do it in a public lobby
        Yeah I've been tempted to pull that in a public lobby myself, but it just ends up feeling *wrong* to me and stop before going through with it
This happened to me yesterday.  I killed someone in electric and vented to medbay immediately as noone walked into either room. Literally like 3 seconds later someone called a meeting and said they saw me kill and vent from electric. There is no way they would've gotten from electric to the cafeteria at the same as me venting to medbay, unless they were lying and already in the cafe, but of course randoms vote quick as hell without hearing reasoning or defenses so I was ejected.
    The vent animation shows up even if you don't have direct line of sight to the vent. If you are standing in security you can see the vents in both electrical and medbay. With that it's pretty easy to run by and see who is leaving the room that was vented to.

You can also see the vent in electrical from the behind the first wall in electrical. If you know who was on the other side before seeing the vent animation then you know who the imposter is.
        Notice how it took longer than 3 seconds to get to the button. The point im trying to make is none of the things that everyone is saying explains the speed in which he called the meeting so fast that you cant even make a move after getting out of the vent. Its not like I hovered in the vent either. I went in and out of the vent immediately after killing.
    Lets say I'm getting gas to refuel the engines, and I see you walk into electrical. I decide to stop by electrical to do wires on my way to the engine, but you're not there, and there's a dead body. I didn't see you come out, so the only logical assumption is that you killed them and fled the scene through a vent.

You don't have to directly witness something to figure out what happened.
        To be fair, he did say that he called a meeting, as opposed to reporting the body, and said he was in the cafe (which confirms that).  There is still one viable possibility, though, without knowing more details:  Maybe he was watching Admin, and saw a user disappear from electric, at the same time one appeared in MedBay  (i.e. "saw you vent"), and when he went towards cafe to confirm, saw you coming from MedBay?  I've heard there's a way to "see" kills on admin (the icon flickers or something?)
            I do this, admin is incredibly useful when people are randomly wandering around to see if it was a self report by the killer, 2 blips, 1 blip and a report and you know they just self reported.
                Dead bodies still show up in admin on Skeld though, right? So how does this help?
                    If there are only 2 blips and its reported the one that reported had to be the one that did it if nothing else has moved since.
                        Yeah what I’m saying is you would have to sit and wait for a while. A dead body and someone who has three tasks in electrical look very similar unless you just sit at admin. Even then, someone walking in after and reporting would fit your criteria as it would appear as if two people were in there when they walked into a room with a dead body. 

This is assuming I am right about bodies appearing on admin map, which I’m fairly sure is right.
                            He reported right when I popped out of the vent so it was in the span of like 3 seconds
I was an imposter but hadn't killed anyone yet. I was on the opposite side of the map when a crewmate was killed and someone (not other imposter) starts telling everyone they saw *me* do it. I was so pissed they voted for me because they felt vindicated, but they were fucking wrong.
    I hate it when this happens
    I was in a game where after a dead body was found and it turned out to be the 2nd body, they were all, "This imposter seems far more competent. Vote Tathas out."  

I mean, it was me, but nobody had any actual proof.
        Only thing to do is haunt their asses
Yeah this has happened to me before, I always called them out for cheating. Sadly no one cares
Their dicks
    What about their dicks?
        They are small
Sounds like my "friend" group. Stopped playing with them right away
I'd love being that guy. Fuck em
I’m always on discord with my friends. We don’t cheat or tell who killed us. Kicking people just because they are on discord is dumb. Everyone using discord doesn’t cheat. We want to play the game and removing any challenge from the game removes the fun.
    I play on Discord with my friends, but I dislike it for public matches. Even if the Discord group isn't cheating, they seldom talk to the rest of the players. I was in a game where half the players voted for one guy with no discussion. When I asked, they told me they were in Discord. So it's a crappy thing to do if you aren't communicating with the players who are not in your Discord.
        We use the in game chat as well.
            This is how my friends play in public as well, I make sure my friends are typing in chat what we're saying in voice.
                [deleted]
                    We use an xbox chat cuz we don't all have discord but it's because there's only 2-4 of us, too small for a game. We have a code of honor though where we only speak during discussion rounds and make sure to type in the chat the things we suspect.
                        Pretty much the same for us but we talk the whole time about non game related stuff and talk game stuff during votes. No reason to stay silent might as well have a convo.
        That literally just happened to me. Nobody said anything and all of a sudden everyone voted me.
    Maybe you and your buddy play like that but i don't know if you have some sort of honour system or a cheating system going on.

Literally the only time anyone ever mentions being on discord in among us is to inform who the imposter was by speaking to their buddy. If you don't do that then I'll never know you are on discord and you wont ket kicked.
Some people dont have friends or are too shy to join a discord
As is the standard practice, of course.
    I've had this a lot...
    Yes
I played with people like that and when they claimed I killed their sister I just said he was simping and trying to cover the fact that he is imposter
    Lmao
    I had a husband-wife playing that were cool until one was imp and the other wasn’t. Came down to the 3 of us, with wife killing #4 in front of us. Husband covers for her anyway. So not cool.
Damn, was that my kids (8 and 10)? I gave them an earful after realizing what was going on.
    Damn, I wish my parents played video games with me when I was younger.
    Idk tbh

It was a random game and hey were blue and white
dayum.
Hate when people do that, I make lobby’s with my sister, but we ignore each other except for when we can use the chat and talk to everyone and never say anything we shouldn’t
My wife and I play in the same room, the second the match starts to when it’s over we are silent. I don’t get why people cheat on this game
Lol they’re probably kids or something why are you calling them bitches

Like I get leaving once you realize what’s going on but you don’t have to be a dick too. If anything just send a message that says “please don’t cheat” or something like that

Edit: my point is you can call them out without being a total asshole about it lmao maybe talk to them before “calling them bitches and leaving” bc that accomplishes literally nothing
    >  If anything just send a message that says “please don’t cheat” or something like that

Is this your first online game or what
        I’m just saying you can approach it without being a dick
        [https://youtu.be/wTuhMUja7us](https://youtu.be/wTuhMUja7us)
    We makes mistakes in the heat of ANGER Jimbo
    Yeah saying please don’t cheat is so helpful
    If they’re such little pussies that they can actively ruin peoples fun but can’t take getting called a bitch because of it then they can get off the computer and go hop on the youtube kids app on their ipad and watch some metrosexual weirdo with purple hair play the game completely curse free.
        Sounds like you’re having a heated gamer moment
            im gonna say it
                the gamer word
                    MRS OBAMA, GET DOWN
    This entire subreddit is 15 year olds 

You’re talking to a child
        This implies we're all children now

I'm afraid
            This is terrible news for my spouse.
    Kids need to learn that cheating is bad and wrong. We need a newer, stronger word for cheating in among us.
    [removed]
So my SO and I play together. If 1 of us is the imposter we let each other know. The other doesnt add anything to the chat and doesnt defend themselves or the imp.

If we are both crewmates. We identify that and go about our mission. If one of us gets killed you might hear "gosh darn saggy balls" "u ded?" "...ya" and dont identify the killer.

Still fun and able to connect with my SO fairly.
I had this happen with cousins
    That’s fucking hot bro
And then they’ll be back at it next game. Really don’t understand the hesitation in kicking.
This has been the norm for years.  In games where info is important and have a separate dead chat, if you get killed you don't talk about how on outside comms, or at least until everyone is dead or end of round.
Yes Mr. Cake man
Yeah honestly, I play it where I often have 5 friends in discord then fill with random, but we don't cheat. If important info gets relayed in discord we post it in the chat too and also if any of us dies we don't say anything in discord, like its supposed to be.

Though I suppose it wouldn't make much sense for a 5 person discord to cheat because we mostly want to play against each other and that would spoil it for everyone.
I dunno. The odds of you being able to type out all of the info you said out loud is unlikely.

But it's not as bad as people who do this, *don't* type anything, and then just vote without a word.
Why? That’s just redundant
Technically it does track stats but not publicly, so there are no bragging rights included.
    Well if the stats aren't public who cares? It's a black box, if nobody can see em there's no reason to think about them
I'm sorry EnderSkoom
Ayyy, exactly what I thought
Y e s. This. I got kicked from a lobby after making friends and being friendly withe everyone, then when I said it was the host (I think he was like lime or smthn, doesn't really matter) and he got voted out, it was him, then he kicks me from the lobby for voting him out. Like what.
Because it’s blatant cheating? The whole point of the game is to figure out who the imposter is through detective work. If your friend is telling you who it is, both of you are cheating and ruining the game for everyone else.
    [deleted]
        No, the dead can’t actually talk to the living in the game. They can see what the living are saying, but the dead can only talk to each other.

If the dead could tell who killed them, the game would be over really quickly, and the imposters would lose 99% of the time.
            That makes perfect sense, cool. Definitely glad I picked it up, it looks really fun
                Let me give you a tip: Search for a discord with an active playerbase rather quickly.

It'll be much better than random players (more logical conclusions, less random voting, less cheaters)
You can but everyone has to vote to kick them
[deleted]
    Yeah so everybody compliments how smart you are.
        [deleted]
            One time I had a game where someone was cheating and they thought that was how you were supposed to play. I also had one where there were these 2 people just holding the lobby hostage cause one was imposter and there was 3 people.
                Among us public servers suck, just play it with friends or find a lobby on discord servers.
                    Aye, since if no-one's cheating, you can't report anything.
"Hi so I saw black venting" (he was)
*instantly voted off*
                The people in your first example were probably young children. Like when you play 100% luck boardgames with them and you're like "Wow you're really good in this game" and they really believe they have skill in rolling the dice, that's how old they probably were.
            Thats why my username is Big PP so people know before hand.
    That way you can climb the leaderboards and unlock all the best armor.
Imagine cheating in a game where there are absolutely no benefits to winning
Imagine cheating
    Cheating single-player is fine, godmode with explosive bullets in far cry 5 is so fun. Multi-player cheating ruins it for everyone.
        Facts
Imagine cheating on your girl
Some people don't care about fun, they care about winning at any cost
Yes and it's also the worst when you call them out for cheating and they're just like "lol you're getting butt hurt over a game" or "I didn't realize you could cheat in this game"
It's just people who lose all the time and are salty about it so they get their power trip by cheating. They also say things like "everyone hacks anyways" so they can rationalize how badly they play.
I joined a game where one person had hacked the game to make themself the imposter every time and set it to instantly kill the other 9 players simultaneously as soon as the game started and they were doing it over and over... I was just like what’s the point? Like if there was a leaderboard ok but they were just waiting for the lobby to fill every time to win in one second
Because the game is full of kids and kids are stupid
They have fun by hurting others.
Send them to horny jail

    Wtf is that about? There was a guy who was following around one of the other players never did a single task and repeatedly would only say in chat shit like 

“I love you white” “ I love white” “i’m in love with white” 

I bailed on the lobby because this Dingus was just deadweight and like 10 minutes later I ended up in another lobby were somebody else was doing the same thing except he kept saying “I fucked pink”
> Edit: am I The only one who constantly gets in games with people following around other characters saying “I love you” in chat and asking for their Snapchat?

Not snapchat, but I had someone praising me for being good and asking for my discord.
    Yeah I seem to keep finding these people who follow a character around and keep saying “ what’s your snap?/Can I have your snap?/Snap please”
Imagine 🤔 cheating 🤥 on 🔛 a murder 🔪 mystery ❓ game 🎮
    Good bot.
Lol the last game I played someone said the saw me vent but I wasn’t an imposter and they weren’t either... I was like wtf why??
    Sometimes you see a vent animation and then you see someone. Sometimes you mistake someone's colour because they're wearing a suit. Sometimes your brain plays tricks with you. Shit happens.
        They were standing right next to me in caf with nobody else and we weren’t by a vent so idk 🤷‍♀️
            He was probably 9 years old and thought it was funny.
    Occasionally I’ll get lag where people blip in and out of existence. If that happens when you’re over a vent, I could see how a new player might think it was a venting.
    I played a game today where I couldn't find lime anywhere. I ran around the whole map and didn't see them, everyone else was done in cams. So I called a meeting. Said they were sus, they got voted and were an impostor. Then I saw orange do shields but there was no animation so I knew they faked it but I was out of meeting calls
    People do that all the time.  Had someone walk away from a deadbody and I reported it and they said it must be me.  We voted them off and they were innocent.  Its like whyyy??
I haven't played the game but is saying you saw them vent (if they actually did) a valid reason? Or is that cheating like this post?
    [deleted]
Oh that shits infuriating. I was imposter and walked my ass to security to watch some people and someone called a meeting and said I vented. Nothing I could do would change those peoples minds so I got ejected.
I always say that ("I saw red vent"), when for example, I see them doing a common task that nobody has.
    Why not just say tht then if they kick red and hes not imp theyre gonna kick u and then ur down 2 ppl
        Cause public people don't understand common tasks
            But its not the same as venting at all calling out  a vent is supposed to be 100% because u saw then vent. Common tasks arent 100% proof
That's the worst.  It's the confidence that sells it.

If it's a two imp game I normally type out something like "God dammit Gary (even if they're not Gary IRL), why are you such a little bitch?!  Hey all, he's the other imp."
    I try to sell it with fake salt.  "Man I ALWAYS get caught when I'm imp!  Screw this game!  Gray is other impo.  Fuck this."  I don't do it every time but any time you're solidly identified as imp right off the top it's an avenue for advantage.  Can't tell you how many times I've seen a group react to that with like 2 crew drops and then a vote to eject a crew member.
Ughhh I hate this! And “not me, I have scan/trash”
And then nobody votes them next
[deleted]
I play on mobile, and I have had something similar happen almost every time I'm impostor. Don't kill or vent someone pushes the button and knows who both impostors are
I'm upset to see these people out here.

    Link Steam account would be pretty easy
        The only problem with that is a lot of people play on mobile and not everyone has a steam account. Maybe they could have multiple options like steam, Google, facebook, instagram, etc.
            Steam app on phone. But yeah, all the login options are good, so do all of them XD
                You’re an idiot.
                Not everyone has a steam account or wants one. The game is very popular among normal people aswell.
            You can have a steam account without owning a pc. And steam has a mobile app.
                I know but how many people do you think are going to go out and make a steam account just to play among us
        "easy"

You are clearly not a developer. Linking steam is not convenient for the developer. 

For the user? Yes. It's awesome.

For developers it is hell on Earth getting that shit to work
They could probably add subtitles to the account? Cheater title for anyone who does this a certain number of times. And if they persist have a repeat offender title.
    Make them be the color cream and where the word shame around their necks.
    And what would check if they cheated? Manual review? AI? Both solutions are very unlikely to happen for a *3 people dev team.*
[I proposed a solution on a post that got largely ignored.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmongUs/comments/j96eca/i_propose_we_rename_the_game_to_quiting_simulator/g8hpcun/) I think it would end the problem at least mitigate it. There is no need to make accounts , but steam games can store your id. And that would make punishments like this increasingly bad.
    Much like the Low Priority Queue that Dota 2 uses. If you quit X amount of games you get placed into the LPQ and have to finish a number of games in that queue to be released back into the wild. If you’re in the LPQ you can’t team up with friends and play ranked until you’re out and you also don’t gain any rank when playing LPQ a games.
        I actually thought of this concept for fixing Among Us and didn’t know it already existed. Cool!
            The only downside to it in Dota is that it’s pretty harsh so if you have a few accidental disconnects in a row you’re stuck in a queue with the most toxic people in the game until you get out. But I’d much rather pay that price for accidental inclusion than let it go unpunished lol.
                Dota is much higher stakes than Among Us isn't it? I think Among Us could have a system that just measures your average against the global average. If your rank is within the upper standard deviation, then you're good, so a few random disconnects shouldn't matter as long as you have a good track record of finishing games. In Dota it probably needs to be more strict because I imagine people would be selling their "good rep" accounts, though I don't imagine people doing that for Among Us.
IP ban. Then hey have to use a different device or wifi network to play. Kids who use discord to cheat almost certainly don’t have a VPN so bypass is unlikely
ip address or sum. that’s how growtopia did it. no one could play at my house lmao
    When Valve first introduced trust factor into CSGO people were reporting kow trust because of shares IPs (valve didnt confirm if it was true or not) where people in university or somewhere with a large group of people living together would all have low trust because someone else on that same ip had been banned before.
[deleted]
I like how they think that banning you is some kind of threat or punishment. 

Dude, if you’re going to be that way then I’m going to be leaving the lobby on my own after the game is over.
Nah, nah. Eject purple and let the impostor win. Purple will probably ragequit. If they don’t, ban them.
    You assume the cheaters don’t make their own lobby’s
        [deleted]
            I was in a lobby, killed someone with lights out and no one else around and their friend hit the emergency button and said “it’s purple I saw them kill and vent!”

I didn’t vent so I knew they were lying. I accused them of cheating and when the round ended we were back in the lobby. I asked “how did you see me?” And the host kicked me. I joined right back in and asked again “I’m sorry, you must have hit the wrong button by accident. How did you see me? There was no one around when I killed them.”

They responded by banning me. I was just hoping to get a confession that they were cheating but didn’t dignify that with a response. Oh well, I joined another lobby with people that actually played correctly
            Idk, I always host the lobby and people still join and cheat all the time
            I only play among us on the discord now
            Pretty sure if enough people vote to kick the host it still works. 

Gotta do it in game though
            My gf and I host our own lobby and cheaters still join.

The good news is, once you ban 1, the others usually leave too.
    Wow I never thought of this
    Still ruins the game.  
Just hopefully ruins it for the cheater more.
    Game still ruined no matter what you do. It's so frustrating when you finally get imposter and some cheating fuck ruins it
That’s the story of any popular game tbf. Small game gets popular, attracts little kids, they ruin it for the other players.
    Hey I’m a kid and I play fairly and don’t randomly vote someone just cos someone else did😢 I hate it when other ppl just vote off somebody just cos one person voted even tho he didn’t say anything😒
Lol, I wasn’t trying to put in actual math figures, I was more using 1/20 more as an embellishment because it feels like that sometimes. Your math is right though.
    Ohhh i understand, yea i does feel really like you never get imp and when the chance is 20% its so wierd.
        That's entirely valid. Statistics say:

Over a large number of games, your observed number of impostor games should end up near 1/5, coming closer to 1/5 the more games you played.

But on the other hand, streaks are possible. There is still a (4/5)^n chance that your next n games will be crewmate. That's still n=1 80%, n=2 64%, 51%, 40%, 32%, .... So yeah, for a sequence of 3 games, it's just a coin flip to gain imposter once and it's quite likely to be crew "all the time". Especially because you remember things you dislike better.
            I have a friend who only plays like 3 games and quits if hes not imposter by the 3rd game. So weve played 4 times and hes not been imposter and complains about it.

Hes like "well thats the 12th game without imposter". Yeah but you also dont really give it a chance to be imposter. Im fairly certain if he played all the rounds we played in a row, he wouldve been imposter atleast once. If you play 3 and quit, odds technically dont change but its like leaving one slot machine for another, its like theres a reset.
        Well the thing is it is a chance, it is totally possible that you just have a ton of rounds where you are not impostor or a ton of rounds where you are always impostor. It has to be completely random unfortunately.
            True. Flip a coin 100 times, and in those flips you statistically would have had 7 heads or 7 tails in a row at some point. Tell a person to estimate a coin flip 100 times, and they probably wont do seven in a row at any point. 

People are really bad at imagining randomness
            I was thinking about a way to improve on pure randomness. This way would require all players to make accounts.

A raffle system would work.

You could give each player account an extra ticket for every non imposter game they play out, and reset it when they play imposter. Give out negative chance to be imposter to punish quitting early for folks who just want to play imposter and quit every game they aren't.

So if you've played imposter last game or never played the game before, you have 10 tickets in the pool. In a ten person game that's the 10% baseline. But if you've played 5 non-imp games in a row you have 15 tickets.

Every game you quit, you lose a ticket for 24 hours. A strategy to ban quitter accounts and use cooldowns for accounts on quitter IPs could be implemented to beat people just trying to use 20 accounts to get around the restriction.

Streakiness is reduced and quitters are punished.
            I played for four hours straight and didn't get impostor once. I should have recorded it. Probably set a record. Was playing 2 impostor lobbies as well.
I have played 30 games straight without getting imposter once.
Well yes but actually no
But each games is it's own 1 or 2 out of 10.

Flipping a coin 100 times and they could all land heads. Doesn't meant the chance isnt still 50/50.
I have never played Among Us but have been entertained by watching people play in private games who clearly respect the rules. I knew from watching it that playing public games would be a complete waste of time as it’s just wide open to cheaters. Unfortunately the lowest common denominator will always fuck up the honour system for everyone else.
    I’ve found that watching the settings can help get better games. Cheaters and people that drop because they didn’t get imposter tends to prefer really unbalanced settings. 

Some of my best games have been one off public servers. Having friends in discord makes it more fun to play for 5 hours straight, but they start to learn your play style and that makes it harder as imposter.
    Honestly, most games are not as filled with cheaters as some would have you believe. It does happen and will happen to you, but I wouldn't say I run into that every day. I have 10ish hours of playtime and ran into that maybe 3 or 4 times.

The actual common one that happens in, what feels like half the games, is 1-2 people leaving right at the start because they didn't get impostor. That stings, because IF you have a 10/10 full lobby and that happens, you pretty much need to vote one of the impostors out in that first meeting. If it wasn't a full lobby, or if 3 people quit, you might as well all quit and join a new lobby.

All of the games issues go away when you play with a group of friends though. The game is definitely best enjoyed with friends, or at least in a Discord call of rule-abiding people
    It was fine in the beginning, but it's gotten completely out of control recently. Just uninstalled
    I recommend joining the r/AmongUs discord and playing over voice chat. Sure, you encounter cheaters and bad sports once in a while, but the game quality is 10x better than playing over text imo.
Well if it helps, I’ve heard there’s an among us discord server you could join and find people to play with, that way you don’t have to deal with all the crap you usually deal with in Public lobbies
I find it best to at least have two other friends. Best if it's 5-6. You find decent randoms pretty quickly, who we invite to the discord... rinse and repeat each night someone plays. Once the room is full with decent people, all of this bullshit is unnecessary.
TIL "SHHHHHHHHHH" has 5 syllables
    Yeah this is big brain time
I only play public when my group is offline. I wish my group was on more.
I only play public (I’m on the free mobile version) because I can’t get my friends to play and the ones who do are on different work schedules than me so if I want to play it’s public or bust. If I don’t like a game or I can tell it’s discord run then I leave and find a new one! I’ve had a lot of fun actually in some public ones.
    Same. I mainly play on Mira now too. I just want a quick 10 minutes of fun between work assignments throughout the day. Public is the easiest. If I hate a lobby, I bounce.
    Join any of the public discords (some are full, but new ones always pop up. It took me about 15 mins to find one that worked). It's the same random lobby type experience but when everyone has to actually talk to each other you get a lot fewer people ruining the game.
I could only stand the garbage of public lobbies for 20 minutes before rage quitting. I only play when my friends are online now sadly
If you don't have discord and aren't used to it, it feels kinda daunting to figure out at first. I powered through it this week so I could find lobbies and I'm so glad I did
I don't have friends
    Theres plenty of discord servers for matchmaking if you're on PC
        Yeah true but I'm too lazy for that lmfaoooo
You gotta join a dedicated among us discord. There is an official Innersloth discord but I heard it's full. But there are plenty private ones, just ask on the subreddit or sth. Playing eith randoms is cancer, dont do it to your blood pressure.
This subreddit has a discord.

Download discord and make an account. Do all the activation stuff. Follow the link in the sidebar to go to the server.

Do the reaction in the main thread then you can access the LFG (looking for game) threads. There, people post links to games that need a player where you can join and do voice chat. They also have no mic LFG lobbies if you want the silent experience.

Trust, I felt old too trying to figure this out.
This just happened to me! I hate being the impostor, but I was doing a little better. (I just started playing and I’m not sneaky) I finally made a kill and they had suspected everyone but me... and someone says “I’m on the phone with them and it’s [me].” It was the room host so I left the game. Just when I was starting to get better at being imp they ruined it for me.
    Oh they don't just ruin it for the imposter, they ruin the game for everyone.  No matter what happens (play it out or quit) the game is wasted.
        Exactly! I had played another room where there were 2 cousins on the phone and they kept it pretty fair from what I can remember. This was my first encounter with cheating that blatant, and it definitely deflated the fun.
oh crap I think that was my discord group. my bad dude. I kept telling them that we shouldn’t make the server public because it’s annoying and randoms hate it. for some reason, they insisted.
:)  :D
To feel powerful.

That's literally all they need and is the reason why most are cheating. Not to pad some statistic, they know it's fake. It's only to dominate others most of the time.
bc they're kids who are too young to understand why they are playing what they are playing and too dumb to play the game legitimately, so they feel the need to cheat to "win". saves them the brain power of actually having to determine who the impostor is genuinely.
[deleted]
    Played ina  discord server last night and kept getting voted out because I would finish my tasks first and late game people would ask me to do a task to prove I'm a crewmate. Like bitch, it takes 4 minutes to do 5 tasks its not my fault you guys don't know how to play.
If that guy wasnt the host then the host should have kicked him so they had a chance of winning
There are 2 cheaters among us
I did. Also maxed donations and was on his texting team. Still didn't matter :(
    I am so jaded now. I just don't care anymore. We are ruled by corrupt cynics, and lobbyists for big oil and the arms dealers trying to make a quick buck. 

Whatever, we're all gonna be dead in 100 years from climate change anyways, may as well try to enjoy my life while I can instead of parasocially obsessing over shit I have no control over. I'm trying to cut out politics from my media diet, and it bothers me how prominent it is on Reddit, it makes me consider leaving the site. It is like taking a weed whacker to your mental health.
        Sounds like a good response. Be sure to take care of yourself first for sure.
    It absolutely mattered you need to lose that mindset man, had bernie not campaigned as hard as he did and made it as far as he did this platform would look a lot different.  You're effort and work forced concessions and made compromises and that's the cornerstone to democracy.

It reminds me of a quote by a shitty super scientist it is heavy-handed in its brow beating but the message rings true:


"I get it I suddenly get it you're children. That's why my dad put you in the pool and made you duke it out. News flash: my dad was a shitty parent! But when my boys cry about Fairness I remind them that fairness is the philosophical Tooth Fairy! There is no fairness!  

You won't get everything but you will get something, enough with this fairness crap and make some compromises and you get to go home to your friends in their costumes and brag about how much you got em', or you can go back and go "oh we didn't get everything we wanted so we took nothing."
        Until I see any change, I will keep my mindset. We don't have time to take babysteps to appease corrupt CEOs and the selfish moronic masses. People are dying and the earth is getting hotter. 

And I dont trust Biden to make any meaningful changes. If he does great, glad I voted for him. But im not holding my breath.  Let's hope there is a world for your kids to enjoy.

Global warming doesn't give a shit about your concessions. All the species now extinct dont give a shit about compromises. Thousands upon thousands dying due to lack of Healthcare shouldn't be told "hey cheer up, we made some headway!". Catering to selfish assholes is not progress. Progress is progress.
            You already made the compromise you voted for him becuase you saw him as the better choice of the two at some level you do understand the need for compromise for progress to move forward.  I know you're angry and it's justified we're in deep shit but I'm sorry you need to grow the fuck up if you think compromise doesn't lead to progress. 

A political minority has no right to try to and bowl over everyone else to just thier style of thinking.  You want to come to the table?  You better be willing to give as much as you take.
                Lol, we already cater to the minority. Republicans. 

And you need to grow up if you think the last 40 years of compromise has lead to meaning progress. Sure, guys can marry now, but what else. How is the money difference between rich and poor any better. How many people have been saved by lasting Healthcare that wasn't immediately overturned.  

If you want to roll over and show your belly cause it makes you feel better fine, but don't try and act like we are making progress. Once your grow up and learn something you will see how only one side is compromising. 

In a working country yes compromise works and leads to progress. America is not a functioning country by any metric.
                    Hey outside of our argument I peeped your profile and I apologize for misgendering you in the second reply and rectified the problem won't happen again.

And compromise isn't showing your belly and it's that exact mentality that leads others to think compromise is a bad word.  Look no further then virginia to see where small incremental change led to a blue virginia.  Shit sucks and I'm sorry it's not fixed right now this second BUT I will not support a movement who claims to have all the answers to fix all our problems and is unwilling to compromise with people.  That's what we got right now and I just really don't think it's as simple as: the other guy has all the answers.
    Well i meant i hope you voted for Biden. I am a bernie supporter too but my main goal right now is get trump out of office
        Agreed
We all have vastly different schedules so even when we do play together we still have to play with randos who cheat.
    There's like hundreds of discord servers for Among Us out there which you can join and most semi-decently sized ones can get a full lobby within 5-30min, depending on your luck.
That's not an option for everyone
    Uhhhh, yes it is?
    Why?
    [deleted]
    Just join the r/amongus discord or the Among Us LFG discord
Oh, sad.
[deleted]
    From what I understand the dev is working on an account system exactly so they can ban people like that.
        Idk how it isn’t a thing already. I get this has been a smaller game for the past couple years and there was probably just a code of honor in place, but I’ve played enough Gmod to know how much of a problem meta gaming and ghosting can be.
            You don't always foresee these type of issues..
                You shouldn't have to plan around the lowest common denominator...but we do.

If people can fuck something up, there's some asshole out there willing to try
                Happy cake day
            they were intending the game for groups of friends mostly. who may even be on a couch together. and the online play was a bit of an afterthought, afaik. so they never thought that would be such a problem
    Petition for this bruh! Where should I sign
The innersloth official discord has rooms for among us, negating this problem
The worst part is the fact he tried to tell your group to kill themselves. That messed up and it should be a crime
    It actually is, at least where I’m from
        Welp now we have a reason to arrest that douchebag
if he was imposter it would have been alright ,but he wasnt
Still ruined.
    [deleted]
        bruh
            I'll skate to the beach! And I'll look better gettin' there.
        Angel Dust was a sick album!
        Is that supposed to be a dollar store version of a rickroll
            HAHAHA!
        Lmao when the drummer starts playing the lead singer.
    Like with spoilers in Twitch chat you all have to pre-emptively and continuously spam the chat with false accusations to drown out the real ones. Only option.
        I hate twitch.

I also like twitch.
            No one likes Twitch. It's a terrible blight. 

Anyways, gotta go. My Twitch stream starts in 5 minutes!
        Most streamers I watch play the game turn their chats on emote only when they are playing and they go back to regular text chats when they are in the lobbies
        *Laughs in emote only
    Username sounds very familiar...


...János.
    Not necessarily. Just turn it into Alien vs Crewmate.
(Hide and Seek, https://youtu.be/abYgE5TdOm0)
    Not ruined if u turn it into hide and seek
Whats even the point then
    It keeps the game going without completely ruining it for the poor bastard that finally got imposter after probably waiting over an hour
        But why continue. All the fun of the game is lost even if it is a shame that the imposter was revealed by a cheat
            Because then it becomes a different game. Plenty of folks play variations like this anyway.
                Yes but the entire premise is to find the imposter and everyone knows who the imposter is then why would you play? It's not gonna be hard for the imposter to just kill everyone if they deliberately don't vote him off. Just end the match, kick the cheat and move on to the next one lmfao
                    It turns into hide and seek which is actually pretty fun. The entire point is knowing the seeker/imposter and avoiding them while doing tasks at the same time. It kinda becomes dead by daylight in a way.
                        Would be good to have a "hide-and-seek" voting option down next to skip.  When this sort of thing happens and a majority vote hide-and-seek the game changes modes, reduces vision and increases movement speed for crewmates (and the inverse for imposter), reduces kill timer, disables the emergency button and reporting, and away you go.
                        I applaud the duck out of you guys who don’t let a cheater ruin your gaming experience.
                    The premise is to NOT BE KILLED, not to find the imposter.  That is why you can easily win games (if everyone isn’t a dumbass) by doing your tasks.  

The objective is to live and get your team out of that area, not to necessarily find the imposter.
                        EvErYoNe WhO dOeSn'T PlAy LiKe I dO iS a DuMbAsS....

The objective is to have fun, it's a game.  Winning easily isn't always the route one would want to take.  Others disagree.
                    No the point is to get all the tasks done or eject the imposter.
            I wouldn’t say it’s lost. It can still be fun that way considering it’ll become more of a hide & seek from that point forward. It sucks that it was ruined, but that’s an easy way to salvage the game
That’s so fucked. Sorry that game was ruined.
    But that’s the thing, we didn’t let them ruin the game. We just had fun with it.
I wont because I'm not a dick, but I want to start faking being in Discord with someone. I mostly play solo. So I join a game with confirms off. When I'm impostor, just be like [dead color] told me [alive color] did it. We are in Discord. I'd be flat out lying, but everyone just believes that shit. I'm so tempted to try it.
    I would say to only use it after someone else has said it.  
  
"Red told me Yellow killed him through Discord!"

"What are you talking about? Red just told me it was you who killed him, how could you lie about that!"
        That's a good one!
        Ooh, I like it.  Countering with their own shit.  Might buy some time, and even if the metagaming guy was crew and correct that yellow was imposter he deserves to get spaced anyway for metagaming
    May as well. Not like most random lobbies have players with an attention span longer than 15 seconds with confirm on. “White was not an imposter “ - “welp, guess we’ll just forget red fully lied about seeing him kill yellow.”

Win so many games as imposter that way.
        That just leads to "vote them and if not vote me" argument which is also stupid. Suiciding as an impostor is great if there are multiples. 

Imagine there are 2 impostors. You get caught in a kill and get a crewmember vented before you and you just took out at least 2 people. That leaves the other impostor 6v1, which isnt great, but not bad given how quickly some other random impostors get murdered.

Now imagine you take out before you suicide vent, your teammate and you take out 4 people. Then plus the vented crewmember you used "vote them and if not vote me" on, your lone teammate is at a 1v4. I really like those odds if I'm the lone impostor.
            That’s why I just do “I saw them kill x right in front of me.” Just as soon as the chat box comes up. With 2 imposters and no confirm I can make it work at least twice.

But I used the “saw them kill right in front of me” tactic 9v1 with confirm on and the one guy who stuck around too call a meeting after ejecting an innocent was the next victim. Next meeting was down to 3 and there was no accusation even leveled resulting in a skip vote. Had the other two remembered 5 minutes prior I would have lost.
                I was 1v3 and got seen killing. Blamed the other guy, saying "if not him then vote me next." 1v2, I'm hoping I can get the last kill before they can call the meeting. Right after, I check the meeting cooldown, it's 3 seconds shorter than my kill cooldown. Crap, I just lost. Except the 2 dumbasses immediately run off to do missions. Okay, I'll wait by the button and sabotage 02. As soon as they clear the emergency, I duck down to admin for the win.  
Like come on.. See the bigger picture. You know I'm the only imposter and I only need one more kill. If you call the meeting, you win. If my cooldown is shorter, you lose. If you don't hit the #@&$ button, you lose!
    Yea people get all on about honor and stuff in this game trying to play it like fucking sherlock holmes. Nah go full puppet master, just claim people are faking tasks, say "vote me out if I'm wrong" then next time around self report and urgently blame someone else.
    i did somthing similar once by fake ratting out the other imposter ,of sadly the innocent who i blamed got really mad and i got kicked after the game
    I play like this tbh, and it's pretty effective. I haven't tried the "I'm in discord, it's him" claim yet, but I'm definitely going too now. The big one I like doing is fake snitching on my other impostor when I'm blatantly busted. Like 2 people see me kill on cams, so I know I'm going out the airlock, but I'll fake being salty about it, pick a quiet crew member, claim they're an idiot and not helping me, and say to eject them too. %60 of the time it works every time, especially if my real other impostor isn't sus and piles on.

EDIT: You shouldn't even feel like a dick playing like this either. The point of being impostor is to mess with crew to throw sus off you, and anything goes that way. Lying about being in discord with a dead guy isn't any different then lying about not killing them in the first place.
    What I can tell you is after seeing a bunch of butthurt imposters get caught call out the other imposters in chat before they get ejected, I've started doing the same.

Except I call out some random innocent guy, and so far 100% of the time that guy will get immediately ejected. I feel bad about it but was hoping to spread doubt in the community of just believing these dickheads. 

So go for it. They will absolutely eject them without a second thought because most people are idiots.
This was my idea and I play as a solo. I'd feel bad about "ruining" a game, even though I'm just fake ruining it. But I want to see how many times everyone would believe me lol
    Exact same problem here. I only do it as a joke among my friends because I'm too scared to do it in a public lobby
    Yeah I've been tempted to pull that in a public lobby myself, but it just ends up feeling *wrong* to me and stop before going through with it
The vent animation shows up even if you don't have direct line of sight to the vent. If you are standing in security you can see the vents in both electrical and medbay. With that it's pretty easy to run by and see who is leaving the room that was vented to.

You can also see the vent in electrical from the behind the first wall in electrical. If you know who was on the other side before seeing the vent animation then you know who the imposter is.
    Notice how it took longer than 3 seconds to get to the button. The point im trying to make is none of the things that everyone is saying explains the speed in which he called the meeting so fast that you cant even make a move after getting out of the vent. Its not like I hovered in the vent either. I went in and out of the vent immediately after killing.
Lets say I'm getting gas to refuel the engines, and I see you walk into electrical. I decide to stop by electrical to do wires on my way to the engine, but you're not there, and there's a dead body. I didn't see you come out, so the only logical assumption is that you killed them and fled the scene through a vent.

You don't have to directly witness something to figure out what happened.
    To be fair, he did say that he called a meeting, as opposed to reporting the body, and said he was in the cafe (which confirms that).  There is still one viable possibility, though, without knowing more details:  Maybe he was watching Admin, and saw a user disappear from electric, at the same time one appeared in MedBay  (i.e. "saw you vent"), and when he went towards cafe to confirm, saw you coming from MedBay?  I've heard there's a way to "see" kills on admin (the icon flickers or something?)
        I do this, admin is incredibly useful when people are randomly wandering around to see if it was a self report by the killer, 2 blips, 1 blip and a report and you know they just self reported.
            Dead bodies still show up in admin on Skeld though, right? So how does this help?
                If there are only 2 blips and its reported the one that reported had to be the one that did it if nothing else has moved since.
                    Yeah what I’m saying is you would have to sit and wait for a while. A dead body and someone who has three tasks in electrical look very similar unless you just sit at admin. Even then, someone walking in after and reporting would fit your criteria as it would appear as if two people were in there when they walked into a room with a dead body. 

This is assuming I am right about bodies appearing on admin map, which I’m fairly sure is right.
                        He reported right when I popped out of the vent so it was in the span of like 3 seconds
I hate it when this happens
I was in a game where after a dead body was found and it turned out to be the 2nd body, they were all, "This imposter seems far more competent. Vote Tathas out."  

I mean, it was me, but nobody had any actual proof.
    Only thing to do is haunt their asses
What about their dicks?
    They are small
I play on Discord with my friends, but I dislike it for public matches. Even if the Discord group isn't cheating, they seldom talk to the rest of the players. I was in a game where half the players voted for one guy with no discussion. When I asked, they told me they were in Discord. So it's a crappy thing to do if you aren't communicating with the players who are not in your Discord.
    We use the in game chat as well.
        This is how my friends play in public as well, I make sure my friends are typing in chat what we're saying in voice.
            [deleted]
                We use an xbox chat cuz we don't all have discord but it's because there's only 2-4 of us, too small for a game. We have a code of honor though where we only speak during discussion rounds and make sure to type in the chat the things we suspect.
                    Pretty much the same for us but we talk the whole time about non game related stuff and talk game stuff during votes. No reason to stay silent might as well have a convo.
    That literally just happened to me. Nobody said anything and all of a sudden everyone voted me.
Maybe you and your buddy play like that but i don't know if you have some sort of honour system or a cheating system going on.

Literally the only time anyone ever mentions being on discord in among us is to inform who the imposter was by speaking to their buddy. If you don't do that then I'll never know you are on discord and you wont ket kicked.
I've had this a lot...
Yes
Lmao
I had a husband-wife playing that were cool until one was imp and the other wasn’t. Came down to the 3 of us, with wife killing #4 in front of us. Husband covers for her anyway. So not cool.
Damn, I wish my parents played video games with me when I was younger.
Idk tbh

It was a random game and hey were blue and white
>  If anything just send a message that says “please don’t cheat” or something like that

Is this your first online game or what
    I’m just saying you can approach it without being a dick
    [https://youtu.be/wTuhMUja7us](https://youtu.be/wTuhMUja7us)
We makes mistakes in the heat of ANGER Jimbo
Yeah saying please don’t cheat is so helpful
If they’re such little pussies that they can actively ruin peoples fun but can’t take getting called a bitch because of it then they can get off the computer and go hop on the youtube kids app on their ipad and watch some metrosexual weirdo with purple hair play the game completely curse free.
    Sounds like you’re having a heated gamer moment
        im gonna say it
            the gamer word
                MRS OBAMA, GET DOWN
This entire subreddit is 15 year olds 

You’re talking to a child
    This implies we're all children now

I'm afraid
        This is terrible news for my spouse.
Kids need to learn that cheating is bad and wrong. We need a newer, stronger word for cheating in among us.

That’s fucking hot bro
Well if the stats aren't public who cares? It's a black box, if nobody can see em there's no reason to think about them
[deleted]
    No, the dead can’t actually talk to the living in the game. They can see what the living are saying, but the dead can only talk to each other.

If the dead could tell who killed them, the game would be over really quickly, and the imposters would lose 99% of the time.
        That makes perfect sense, cool. Definitely glad I picked it up, it looks really fun
            Let me give you a tip: Search for a discord with an active playerbase rather quickly.

It'll be much better than random players (more logical conclusions, less random voting, less cheaters)
Yeah so everybody compliments how smart you are.

        One time I had a game where someone was cheating and they thought that was how you were supposed to play. I also had one where there were these 2 people just holding the lobby hostage cause one was imposter and there was 3 people.
            Among us public servers suck, just play it with friends or find a lobby on discord servers.
                Aye, since if no-one's cheating, you can't report anything.
"Hi so I saw black venting" (he was)
*instantly voted off*
            The people in your first example were probably young children. Like when you play 100% luck boardgames with them and you're like "Wow you're really good in this game" and they really believe they have skill in rolling the dice, that's how old they probably were.
        Thats why my username is Big PP so people know before hand.
That way you can climb the leaderboards and unlock all the best armor.
Cheating single-player is fine, godmode with explosive bullets in far cry 5 is so fun. Multi-player cheating ruins it for everyone.
    Facts
*B O N K*
Wtf is that about? There was a guy who was following around one of the other players never did a single task and repeatedly would only say in chat shit like 

“I love you white” “ I love white” “i’m in love with white” 

I bailed on the lobby because this Dingus was just deadweight and like 10 minutes later I ended up in another lobby were somebody else was doing the same thing except he kept saying “I fucked pink”
Yeah I seem to keep finding these people who follow a character around and keep saying “ what’s your snap?/Can I have your snap?/Snap please”
Good bot.
Sometimes you see a vent animation and then you see someone. Sometimes you mistake someone's colour because they're wearing a suit. Sometimes your brain plays tricks with you. Shit happens.
    They were standing right next to me in caf with nobody else and we weren’t by a vent so idk 🤷‍♀️
        He was probably 9 years old and thought it was funny.
Occasionally I’ll get lag where people blip in and out of existence. If that happens when you’re over a vent, I could see how a new player might think it was a venting.
I played a game today where I couldn't find lime anywhere. I ran around the whole map and didn't see them, everyone else was done in cams. So I called a meeting. Said they were sus, they got voted and were an impostor. Then I saw orange do shields but there was no animation so I knew they faked it but I was out of meeting calls
People do that all the time.  Had someone walk away from a deadbody and I reported it and they said it must be me.  We voted them off and they were innocent.  Its like whyyy??
[deleted]
Why not just say tht then if they kick red and hes not imp theyre gonna kick u and then ur down 2 ppl
    Cause public people don't understand common tasks
        But its not the same as venting at all calling out  a vent is supposed to be 100% because u saw then vent. Common tasks arent 100% proof
I try to sell it with fake salt.  "Man I ALWAYS get caught when I'm imp!  Screw this game!  Gray is other impo.  Fuck this."  I don't do it every time but any time you're solidly identified as imp right off the top it's an avenue for advantage.  Can't tell you how many times I've seen a group react to that with like 2 crew drops and then a vote to eject a crew member.
Link Steam account would be pretty easy
    The only problem with that is a lot of people play on mobile and not everyone has a steam account. Maybe they could have multiple options like steam, Google, facebook, instagram, etc.
        Steam app on phone. But yeah, all the login options are good, so do all of them XD
            You’re an idiot.
            Not everyone has a steam account or wants one. The game is very popular among normal people aswell.
        You can have a steam account without owning a pc. And steam has a mobile app.
            I know but how many people do you think are going to go out and make a steam account just to play among us
    "easy"

You are clearly not a developer. Linking steam is not convenient for the developer. 

For the user? Yes. It's awesome.

For developers it is hell on Earth getting that shit to work
Make them be the color cream and where the word shame around their necks.
And what would check if they cheated? Manual review? AI? Both solutions are very unlikely to happen for a *3 people dev team.*
Much like the Low Priority Queue that Dota 2 uses. If you quit X amount of games you get placed into the LPQ and have to finish a number of games in that queue to be released back into the wild. If you’re in the LPQ you can’t team up with friends and play ranked until you’re out and you also don’t gain any rank when playing LPQ a games.
    I actually thought of this concept for fixing Among Us and didn’t know it already existed. Cool!
        The only downside to it in Dota is that it’s pretty harsh so if you have a few accidental disconnects in a row you’re stuck in a queue with the most toxic people in the game until you get out. But I’d much rather pay that price for accidental inclusion than let it go unpunished lol.
            Dota is much higher stakes than Among Us isn't it? I think Among Us could have a system that just measures your average against the global average. If your rank is within the upper standard deviation, then you're good, so a few random disconnects shouldn't matter as long as you have a good track record of finishing games. In Dota it probably needs to be more strict because I imagine people would be selling their "good rep" accounts, though I don't imagine people doing that for Among Us.
When Valve first introduced trust factor into CSGO people were reporting kow trust because of shares IPs (valve didnt confirm if it was true or not) where people in university or somewhere with a large group of people living together would all have low trust because someone else on that same ip had been banned before.
You assume the cheaters don’t make their own lobby’s
    [deleted]
        I was in a lobby, killed someone with lights out and no one else around and their friend hit the emergency button and said “it’s purple I saw them kill and vent!”

I didn’t vent so I knew they were lying. I accused them of cheating and when the round ended we were back in the lobby. I asked “how did you see me?” And the host kicked me. I joined right back in and asked again “I’m sorry, you must have hit the wrong button by accident. How did you see me? There was no one around when I killed them.”

They responded by banning me. I was just hoping to get a confession that they were cheating but didn’t dignify that with a response. Oh well, I joined another lobby with people that actually played correctly
        Idk, I always host the lobby and people still join and cheat all the time
        I only play among us on the discord now
        Pretty sure if enough people vote to kick the host it still works. 

Gotta do it in game though
        My gf and I host our own lobby and cheaters still join.

The good news is, once you ban 1, the others usually leave too.
Wow I never thought of this
Still ruins the game.  
Just hopefully ruins it for the cheater more.
Game still ruined no matter what you do. It's so frustrating when you finally get imposter and some cheating fuck ruins it
Hey I’m a kid and I play fairly and don’t randomly vote someone just cos someone else did😢 I hate it when other ppl just vote off somebody just cos one person voted even tho he didn’t say anything😒
Ohhh i understand, yea i does feel really like you never get imp and when the chance is 20% its so wierd.
    That's entirely valid. Statistics say:

Over a large number of games, your observed number of impostor games should end up near 1/5, coming closer to 1/5 the more games you played.

But on the other hand, streaks are possible. There is still a (4/5)^n chance that your next n games will be crewmate. That's still n=1 80%, n=2 64%, 51%, 40%, 32%, .... So yeah, for a sequence of 3 games, it's just a coin flip to gain imposter once and it's quite likely to be crew "all the time". Especially because you remember things you dislike better.
        I have a friend who only plays like 3 games and quits if hes not imposter by the 3rd game. So weve played 4 times and hes not been imposter and complains about it.

Hes like "well thats the 12th game without imposter". Yeah but you also dont really give it a chance to be imposter. Im fairly certain if he played all the rounds we played in a row, he wouldve been imposter atleast once. If you play 3 and quit, odds technically dont change but its like leaving one slot machine for another, its like theres a reset.
    Well the thing is it is a chance, it is totally possible that you just have a ton of rounds where you are not impostor or a ton of rounds where you are always impostor. It has to be completely random unfortunately.
        True. Flip a coin 100 times, and in those flips you statistically would have had 7 heads or 7 tails in a row at some point. Tell a person to estimate a coin flip 100 times, and they probably wont do seven in a row at any point. 

People are really bad at imagining randomness
        I was thinking about a way to improve on pure randomness. This way would require all players to make accounts.

A raffle system would work.

You could give each player account an extra ticket for every non imposter game they play out, and reset it when they play imposter. Give out negative chance to be imposter to punish quitting early for folks who just want to play imposter and quit every game they aren't.

So if you've played imposter last game or never played the game before, you have 10 tickets in the pool. In a ten person game that's the 10% baseline. But if you've played 5 non-imp games in a row you have 15 tickets.

Every game you quit, you lose a ticket for 24 hours. A strategy to ban quitter accounts and use cooldowns for accounts on quitter IPs could be implemented to beat people just trying to use 20 accounts to get around the restriction.

Streakiness is reduced and quitters are punished.
        I played for four hours straight and didn't get impostor once. I should have recorded it. Probably set a record. Was playing 2 impostor lobbies as well.
I’ve found that watching the settings can help get better games. Cheaters and people that drop because they didn’t get imposter tends to prefer really unbalanced settings. 

Some of my best games have been one off public servers. Having friends in discord makes it more fun to play for 5 hours straight, but they start to learn your play style and that makes it harder as imposter.
Honestly, most games are not as filled with cheaters as some would have you believe. It does happen and will happen to you, but I wouldn't say I run into that every day. I have 10ish hours of playtime and ran into that maybe 3 or 4 times.

The actual common one that happens in, what feels like half the games, is 1-2 people leaving right at the start because they didn't get impostor. That stings, because IF you have a 10/10 full lobby and that happens, you pretty much need to vote one of the impostors out in that first meeting. If it wasn't a full lobby, or if 3 people quit, you might as well all quit and join a new lobby.

All of the games issues go away when you play with a group of friends though. The game is definitely best enjoyed with friends, or at least in a Discord call of rule-abiding people
It was fine in the beginning, but it's gotten completely out of control recently. Just uninstalled
I recommend joining the r/AmongUs discord and playing over voice chat. Sure, you encounter cheaters and bad sports once in a while, but the game quality is 10x better than playing over text imo.
Yeah this is big brain time
Same. I mainly play on Mira now too. I just want a quick 10 minutes of fun between work assignments throughout the day. Public is the easiest. If I hate a lobby, I bounce.
Join any of the public discords (some are full, but new ones always pop up. It took me about 15 mins to find one that worked). It's the same random lobby type experience but when everyone has to actually talk to each other you get a lot fewer people ruining the game.
Theres plenty of discord servers for matchmaking if you're on PC
    Yeah true but I'm too lazy for that lmfaoooo
Oh they don't just ruin it for the imposter, they ruin the game for everyone.  No matter what happens (play it out or quit) the game is wasted.
    Exactly! I had played another room where there were 2 cousins on the phone and they kept it pretty fair from what I can remember. This was my first encounter with cheating that blatant, and it definitely deflated the fun.
Played ina  discord server last night and kept getting voted out because I would finish my tasks first and late game people would ask me to do a task to prove I'm a crewmate. Like bitch, it takes 4 minutes to do 5 tasks its not my fault you guys don't know how to play.
I am so jaded now. I just don't care anymore. We are ruled by corrupt cynics, and lobbyists for big oil and the arms dealers trying to make a quick buck. 

Whatever, we're all gonna be dead in 100 years from climate change anyways, may as well try to enjoy my life while I can instead of parasocially obsessing over shit I have no control over. I'm trying to cut out politics from my media diet, and it bothers me how prominent it is on Reddit, it makes me consider leaving the site. It is like taking a weed whacker to your mental health.
    Sounds like a good response. Be sure to take care of yourself first for sure.
It absolutely mattered you need to lose that mindset man, had bernie not campaigned as hard as he did and made it as far as he did this platform would look a lot different.  You're effort and work forced concessions and made compromises and that's the cornerstone to democracy.

It reminds me of a quote by a shitty super scientist it is heavy-handed in its brow beating but the message rings true:


"I get it I suddenly get it you're children. That's why my dad put you in the pool and made you duke it out. News flash: my dad was a shitty parent! But when my boys cry about Fairness I remind them that fairness is the philosophical Tooth Fairy! There is no fairness!  

You won't get everything but you will get something, enough with this fairness crap and make some compromises and you get to go home to your friends in their costumes and brag about how much you got em', or you can go back and go "oh we didn't get everything we wanted so we took nothing."
    Until I see any change, I will keep my mindset. We don't have time to take babysteps to appease corrupt CEOs and the selfish moronic masses. People are dying and the earth is getting hotter. 

And I dont trust Biden to make any meaningful changes. If he does great, glad I voted for him. But im not holding my breath.  Let's hope there is a world for your kids to enjoy.

Global warming doesn't give a shit about your concessions. All the species now extinct dont give a shit about compromises. Thousands upon thousands dying due to lack of Healthcare shouldn't be told "hey cheer up, we made some headway!". Catering to selfish assholes is not progress. Progress is progress.
        You already made the compromise you voted for him becuase you saw him as the better choice of the two at some level you do understand the need for compromise for progress to move forward.  I know you're angry and it's justified we're in deep shit but I'm sorry you need to grow the fuck up if you think compromise doesn't lead to progress. 

A political minority has no right to try to and bowl over everyone else to just thier style of thinking.  You want to come to the table?  You better be willing to give as much as you take.
            Lol, we already cater to the minority. Republicans. 

And you need to grow up if you think the last 40 years of compromise has lead to meaning progress. Sure, guys can marry now, but what else. How is the money difference between rich and poor any better. How many people have been saved by lasting Healthcare that wasn't immediately overturned.  

If you want to roll over and show your belly cause it makes you feel better fine, but don't try and act like we are making progress. Once your grow up and learn something you will see how only one side is compromising. 

In a working country yes compromise works and leads to progress. America is not a functioning country by any metric.
                Hey outside of our argument I peeped your profile and I apologize for misgendering you in the second reply and rectified the problem won't happen again.

And compromise isn't showing your belly and it's that exact mentality that leads others to think compromise is a bad word.  Look no further then virginia to see where small incremental change led to a blue virginia.  Shit sucks and I'm sorry it's not fixed right now this second BUT I will not support a movement who claims to have all the answers to fix all our problems and is unwilling to compromise with people.  That's what we got right now and I just really don't think it's as simple as: the other guy has all the answers.
Well i meant i hope you voted for Biden. I am a bernie supporter too but my main goal right now is get trump out of office
    Agreed
There's like hundreds of discord servers for Among Us out there which you can join and most semi-decently sized ones can get a full lobby within 5-30min, depending on your luck.
Uhhhh, yes it is?
Why?
[deleted]
Just join the r/amongus discord or the Among Us LFG discord
From what I understand the dev is working on an account system exactly so they can ban people like that.
    Idk how it isn’t a thing already. I get this has been a smaller game for the past couple years and there was probably just a code of honor in place, but I’ve played enough Gmod to know how much of a problem meta gaming and ghosting can be.
        You don't always foresee these type of issues..
            You shouldn't have to plan around the lowest common denominator...but we do.

If people can fuck something up, there's some asshole out there willing to try
            Happy cake day
        they were intending the game for groups of friends mostly. who may even be on a couch together. and the online play was a bit of an afterthought, afaik. so they never thought that would be such a problem
Petition for this bruh! Where should I sign

Like with spoilers in Twitch chat you all have to pre-emptively and continuously spam the chat with false accusations to drown out the real ones. Only option.
    I hate twitch.

I also like twitch.
        No one likes Twitch. It's a terrible blight. 

Anyways, gotta go. My Twitch stream starts in 5 minutes!
    Most streamers I watch play the game turn their chats on emote only when they are playing and they go back to regular text chats when they are in the lobbies
    *Laughs in emote only
Username sounds very familiar...


...János.
Not necessarily. Just turn it into Alien vs Crewmate.
(Hide and Seek, https://youtu.be/abYgE5TdOm0)
Not ruined if u turn it into hide and seek
It keeps the game going without completely ruining it for the poor bastard that finally got imposter after probably waiting over an hour
    But why continue. All the fun of the game is lost even if it is a shame that the imposter was revealed by a cheat
        Because then it becomes a different game. Plenty of folks play variations like this anyway.
            Yes but the entire premise is to find the imposter and everyone knows who the imposter is then why would you play? It's not gonna be hard for the imposter to just kill everyone if they deliberately don't vote him off. Just end the match, kick the cheat and move on to the next one lmfao
                It turns into hide and seek which is actually pretty fun. The entire point is knowing the seeker/imposter and avoiding them while doing tasks at the same time. It kinda becomes dead by daylight in a way.
                    Would be good to have a "hide-and-seek" voting option down next to skip.  When this sort of thing happens and a majority vote hide-and-seek the game changes modes, reduces vision and increases movement speed for crewmates (and the inverse for imposter), reduces kill timer, disables the emergency button and reporting, and away you go.
                    I applaud the duck out of you guys who don’t let a cheater ruin your gaming experience.
                The premise is to NOT BE KILLED, not to find the imposter.  That is why you can easily win games (if everyone isn’t a dumbass) by doing your tasks.  

The objective is to live and get your team out of that area, not to necessarily find the imposter.
                    EvErYoNe WhO dOeSn'T PlAy LiKe I dO iS a DuMbAsS....

The objective is to have fun, it's a game.  Winning easily isn't always the route one would want to take.  Others disagree.
                No the point is to get all the tasks done or eject the imposter.
        I wouldn’t say it’s lost. It can still be fun that way considering it’ll become more of a hide & seek from that point forward. It sucks that it was ruined, but that’s an easy way to salvage the game
But that’s the thing, we didn’t let them ruin the game. We just had fun with it.
I would say to only use it after someone else has said it.  
  
"Red told me Yellow killed him through Discord!"

"What are you talking about? Red just told me it was you who killed him, how could you lie about that!"
    That's a good one!
    Ooh, I like it.  Countering with their own shit.  Might buy some time, and even if the metagaming guy was crew and correct that yellow was imposter he deserves to get spaced anyway for metagaming
May as well. Not like most random lobbies have players with an attention span longer than 15 seconds with confirm on. “White was not an imposter “ - “welp, guess we’ll just forget red fully lied about seeing him kill yellow.”

Win so many games as imposter that way.
    That just leads to "vote them and if not vote me" argument which is also stupid. Suiciding as an impostor is great if there are multiples. 

Imagine there are 2 impostors. You get caught in a kill and get a crewmember vented before you and you just took out at least 2 people. That leaves the other impostor 6v1, which isnt great, but not bad given how quickly some other random impostors get murdered.

Now imagine you take out before you suicide vent, your teammate and you take out 4 people. Then plus the vented crewmember you used "vote them and if not vote me" on, your lone teammate is at a 1v4. I really like those odds if I'm the lone impostor.
        That’s why I just do “I saw them kill x right in front of me.” Just as soon as the chat box comes up. With 2 imposters and no confirm I can make it work at least twice.

But I used the “saw them kill right in front of me” tactic 9v1 with confirm on and the one guy who stuck around too call a meeting after ejecting an innocent was the next victim. Next meeting was down to 3 and there was no accusation even leveled resulting in a skip vote. Had the other two remembered 5 minutes prior I would have lost.
            I was 1v3 and got seen killing. Blamed the other guy, saying "if not him then vote me next." 1v2, I'm hoping I can get the last kill before they can call the meeting. Right after, I check the meeting cooldown, it's 3 seconds shorter than my kill cooldown. Crap, I just lost. Except the 2 dumbasses immediately run off to do missions. Okay, I'll wait by the button and sabotage 02. As soon as they clear the emergency, I duck down to admin for the win.  
Like come on.. See the bigger picture. You know I'm the only imposter and I only need one more kill. If you call the meeting, you win. If my cooldown is shorter, you lose. If you don't hit the #@&$ button, you lose!
Yea people get all on about honor and stuff in this game trying to play it like fucking sherlock holmes. Nah go full puppet master, just claim people are faking tasks, say "vote me out if I'm wrong" then next time around self report and urgently blame someone else.
i did somthing similar once by fake ratting out the other imposter ,of sadly the innocent who i blamed got really mad and i got kicked after the game
I play like this tbh, and it's pretty effective. I haven't tried the "I'm in discord, it's him" claim yet, but I'm definitely going too now. The big one I like doing is fake snitching on my other impostor when I'm blatantly busted. Like 2 people see me kill on cams, so I know I'm going out the airlock, but I'll fake being salty about it, pick a quiet crew member, claim they're an idiot and not helping me, and say to eject them too. %60 of the time it works every time, especially if my real other impostor isn't sus and piles on.

EDIT: You shouldn't even feel like a dick playing like this either. The point of being impostor is to mess with crew to throw sus off you, and anything goes that way. Lying about being in discord with a dead guy isn't any different then lying about not killing them in the first place.
What I can tell you is after seeing a bunch of butthurt imposters get caught call out the other imposters in chat before they get ejected, I've started doing the same.

Except I call out some random innocent guy, and so far 100% of the time that guy will get immediately ejected. I feel bad about it but was hoping to spread doubt in the community of just believing these dickheads. 

So go for it. They will absolutely eject them without a second thought because most people are idiots.
Exact same problem here. I only do it as a joke among my friends because I'm too scared to do it in a public lobby
Yeah I've been tempted to pull that in a public lobby myself, but it just ends up feeling *wrong* to me and stop before going through with it
Notice how it took longer than 3 seconds to get to the button. The point im trying to make is none of the things that everyone is saying explains the speed in which he called the meeting so fast that you cant even make a move after getting out of the vent. Its not like I hovered in the vent either. I went in and out of the vent immediately after killing.
To be fair, he did say that he called a meeting, as opposed to reporting the body, and said he was in the cafe (which confirms that).  There is still one viable possibility, though, without knowing more details:  Maybe he was watching Admin, and saw a user disappear from electric, at the same time one appeared in MedBay  (i.e. "saw you vent"), and when he went towards cafe to confirm, saw you coming from MedBay?  I've heard there's a way to "see" kills on admin (the icon flickers or something?)
    I do this, admin is incredibly useful when people are randomly wandering around to see if it was a self report by the killer, 2 blips, 1 blip and a report and you know they just self reported.
        Dead bodies still show up in admin on Skeld though, right? So how does this help?
            If there are only 2 blips and its reported the one that reported had to be the one that did it if nothing else has moved since.
                Yeah what I’m saying is you would have to sit and wait for a while. A dead body and someone who has three tasks in electrical look very similar unless you just sit at admin. Even then, someone walking in after and reporting would fit your criteria as it would appear as if two people were in there when they walked into a room with a dead body. 

This is assuming I am right about bodies appearing on admin map, which I’m fairly sure is right.
                    He reported right when I popped out of the vent so it was in the span of like 3 seconds
Only thing to do is haunt their asses
They are small
We use the in game chat as well.
    This is how my friends play in public as well, I make sure my friends are typing in chat what we're saying in voice.
        [deleted]
            We use an xbox chat cuz we don't all have discord but it's because there's only 2-4 of us, too small for a game. We have a code of honor though where we only speak during discussion rounds and make sure to type in the chat the things we suspect.
                Pretty much the same for us but we talk the whole time about non game related stuff and talk game stuff during votes. No reason to stay silent might as well have a convo.
That literally just happened to me. Nobody said anything and all of a sudden everyone voted me.
I’m just saying you can approach it without being a dick

Sounds like you’re having a heated gamer moment
    im gonna say it
        the gamer word
            MRS OBAMA, GET DOWN
This implies we're all children now

I'm afraid
    This is terrible news for my spouse.
No, the dead can’t actually talk to the living in the game. They can see what the living are saying, but the dead can only talk to each other.

If the dead could tell who killed them, the game would be over really quickly, and the imposters would lose 99% of the time.
    That makes perfect sense, cool. Definitely glad I picked it up, it looks really fun
        Let me give you a tip: Search for a discord with an active playerbase rather quickly.

It'll be much better than random players (more logical conclusions, less random voting, less cheaters)
[deleted]
    One time I had a game where someone was cheating and they thought that was how you were supposed to play. I also had one where there were these 2 people just holding the lobby hostage cause one was imposter and there was 3 people.
        Among us public servers suck, just play it with friends or find a lobby on discord servers.
            Aye, since if no-one's cheating, you can't report anything.
"Hi so I saw black venting" (he was)
*instantly voted off*
        The people in your first example were probably young children. Like when you play 100% luck boardgames with them and you're like "Wow you're really good in this game" and they really believe they have skill in rolling the dice, that's how old they probably were.
    Thats why my username is Big PP so people know before hand.
Facts
They were standing right next to me in caf with nobody else and we weren’t by a vent so idk 🤷‍♀️
    He was probably 9 years old and thought it was funny.
Cause public people don't understand common tasks
    But its not the same as venting at all calling out  a vent is supposed to be 100% because u saw then vent. Common tasks arent 100% proof
The only problem with that is a lot of people play on mobile and not everyone has a steam account. Maybe they could have multiple options like steam, Google, facebook, instagram, etc.
    Steam app on phone. But yeah, all the login options are good, so do all of them XD
        You’re an idiot.
        Not everyone has a steam account or wants one. The game is very popular among normal people aswell.
    You can have a steam account without owning a pc. And steam has a mobile app.
        I know but how many people do you think are going to go out and make a steam account just to play among us
"easy"

You are clearly not a developer. Linking steam is not convenient for the developer. 

For the user? Yes. It's awesome.

For developers it is hell on Earth getting that shit to work
I actually thought of this concept for fixing Among Us and didn’t know it already existed. Cool!
    The only downside to it in Dota is that it’s pretty harsh so if you have a few accidental disconnects in a row you’re stuck in a queue with the most toxic people in the game until you get out. But I’d much rather pay that price for accidental inclusion than let it go unpunished lol.
        Dota is much higher stakes than Among Us isn't it? I think Among Us could have a system that just measures your average against the global average. If your rank is within the upper standard deviation, then you're good, so a few random disconnects shouldn't matter as long as you have a good track record of finishing games. In Dota it probably needs to be more strict because I imagine people would be selling their "good rep" accounts, though I don't imagine people doing that for Among Us.

    I was in a lobby, killed someone with lights out and no one else around and their friend hit the emergency button and said “it’s purple I saw them kill and vent!”

I didn’t vent so I knew they were lying. I accused them of cheating and when the round ended we were back in the lobby. I asked “how did you see me?” And the host kicked me. I joined right back in and asked again “I’m sorry, you must have hit the wrong button by accident. How did you see me? There was no one around when I killed them.”

They responded by banning me. I was just hoping to get a confession that they were cheating but didn’t dignify that with a response. Oh well, I joined another lobby with people that actually played correctly
    Idk, I always host the lobby and people still join and cheat all the time
    I only play among us on the discord now
    Pretty sure if enough people vote to kick the host it still works. 

Gotta do it in game though
    My gf and I host our own lobby and cheaters still join.

The good news is, once you ban 1, the others usually leave too.
That's entirely valid. Statistics say:

Over a large number of games, your observed number of impostor games should end up near 1/5, coming closer to 1/5 the more games you played.

But on the other hand, streaks are possible. There is still a (4/5)^n chance that your next n games will be crewmate. That's still n=1 80%, n=2 64%, 51%, 40%, 32%, .... So yeah, for a sequence of 3 games, it's just a coin flip to gain imposter once and it's quite likely to be crew "all the time". Especially because you remember things you dislike better.
    I have a friend who only plays like 3 games and quits if hes not imposter by the 3rd game. So weve played 4 times and hes not been imposter and complains about it.

Hes like "well thats the 12th game without imposter". Yeah but you also dont really give it a chance to be imposter. Im fairly certain if he played all the rounds we played in a row, he wouldve been imposter atleast once. If you play 3 and quit, odds technically dont change but its like leaving one slot machine for another, its like theres a reset.
Well the thing is it is a chance, it is totally possible that you just have a ton of rounds where you are not impostor or a ton of rounds where you are always impostor. It has to be completely random unfortunately.
    True. Flip a coin 100 times, and in those flips you statistically would have had 7 heads or 7 tails in a row at some point. Tell a person to estimate a coin flip 100 times, and they probably wont do seven in a row at any point. 

People are really bad at imagining randomness
    I was thinking about a way to improve on pure randomness. This way would require all players to make accounts.

A raffle system would work.

You could give each player account an extra ticket for every non imposter game they play out, and reset it when they play imposter. Give out negative chance to be imposter to punish quitting early for folks who just want to play imposter and quit every game they aren't.

So if you've played imposter last game or never played the game before, you have 10 tickets in the pool. In a ten person game that's the 10% baseline. But if you've played 5 non-imp games in a row you have 15 tickets.

Every game you quit, you lose a ticket for 24 hours. A strategy to ban quitter accounts and use cooldowns for accounts on quitter IPs could be implemented to beat people just trying to use 20 accounts to get around the restriction.

Streakiness is reduced and quitters are punished.
    I played for four hours straight and didn't get impostor once. I should have recorded it. Probably set a record. Was playing 2 impostor lobbies as well.
Yeah true but I'm too lazy for that lmfaoooo
Exactly! I had played another room where there were 2 cousins on the phone and they kept it pretty fair from what I can remember. This was my first encounter with cheating that blatant, and it definitely deflated the fun.
Sounds like a good response. Be sure to take care of yourself first for sure.
Until I see any change, I will keep my mindset. We don't have time to take babysteps to appease corrupt CEOs and the selfish moronic masses. People are dying and the earth is getting hotter. 

And I dont trust Biden to make any meaningful changes. If he does great, glad I voted for him. But im not holding my breath.  Let's hope there is a world for your kids to enjoy.

Global warming doesn't give a shit about your concessions. All the species now extinct dont give a shit about compromises. Thousands upon thousands dying due to lack of Healthcare shouldn't be told "hey cheer up, we made some headway!". Catering to selfish assholes is not progress. Progress is progress.
    You already made the compromise you voted for him becuase you saw him as the better choice of the two at some level you do understand the need for compromise for progress to move forward.  I know you're angry and it's justified we're in deep shit but I'm sorry you need to grow the fuck up if you think compromise doesn't lead to progress. 

A political minority has no right to try to and bowl over everyone else to just thier style of thinking.  You want to come to the table?  You better be willing to give as much as you take.
        Lol, we already cater to the minority. Republicans. 

And you need to grow up if you think the last 40 years of compromise has lead to meaning progress. Sure, guys can marry now, but what else. How is the money difference between rich and poor any better. How many people have been saved by lasting Healthcare that wasn't immediately overturned.  

If you want to roll over and show your belly cause it makes you feel better fine, but don't try and act like we are making progress. Once your grow up and learn something you will see how only one side is compromising. 

In a working country yes compromise works and leads to progress. America is not a functioning country by any metric.
            Hey outside of our argument I peeped your profile and I apologize for misgendering you in the second reply and rectified the problem won't happen again.

And compromise isn't showing your belly and it's that exact mentality that leads others to think compromise is a bad word.  Look no further then virginia to see where small incremental change led to a blue virginia.  Shit sucks and I'm sorry it's not fixed right now this second BUT I will not support a movement who claims to have all the answers to fix all our problems and is unwilling to compromise with people.  That's what we got right now and I just really don't think it's as simple as: the other guy has all the answers.
Agreed
Idk how it isn’t a thing already. I get this has been a smaller game for the past couple years and there was probably just a code of honor in place, but I’ve played enough Gmod to know how much of a problem meta gaming and ghosting can be.
    You don't always foresee these type of issues..
        You shouldn't have to plan around the lowest common denominator...but we do.

If people can fuck something up, there's some asshole out there willing to try
        Happy cake day
    they were intending the game for groups of friends mostly. who may even be on a couch together. and the online play was a bit of an afterthought, afaik. so they never thought that would be such a problem
Welp now we have a reason to arrest that douchebag
bruh
    I'll skate to the beach! And I'll look better gettin' there.
Angel Dust was a sick album!
Is that supposed to be a dollar store version of a rickroll
    HAHAHA!
Lmao when the drummer starts playing the lead singer.
I hate twitch.

I also like twitch.
    No one likes Twitch. It's a terrible blight. 

Anyways, gotta go. My Twitch stream starts in 5 minutes!
Most streamers I watch play the game turn their chats on emote only when they are playing and they go back to regular text chats when they are in the lobbies
*Laughs in emote only
But why continue. All the fun of the game is lost even if it is a shame that the imposter was revealed by a cheat
    Because then it becomes a different game. Plenty of folks play variations like this anyway.
        Yes but the entire premise is to find the imposter and everyone knows who the imposter is then why would you play? It's not gonna be hard for the imposter to just kill everyone if they deliberately don't vote him off. Just end the match, kick the cheat and move on to the next one lmfao
            It turns into hide and seek which is actually pretty fun. The entire point is knowing the seeker/imposter and avoiding them while doing tasks at the same time. It kinda becomes dead by daylight in a way.
                Would be good to have a "hide-and-seek" voting option down next to skip.  When this sort of thing happens and a majority vote hide-and-seek the game changes modes, reduces vision and increases movement speed for crewmates (and the inverse for imposter), reduces kill timer, disables the emergency button and reporting, and away you go.
                I applaud the duck out of you guys who don’t let a cheater ruin your gaming experience.
            The premise is to NOT BE KILLED, not to find the imposter.  That is why you can easily win games (if everyone isn’t a dumbass) by doing your tasks.  

The objective is to live and get your team out of that area, not to necessarily find the imposter.
                EvErYoNe WhO dOeSn'T PlAy LiKe I dO iS a DuMbAsS....

The objective is to have fun, it's a game.  Winning easily isn't always the route one would want to take.  Others disagree.
            No the point is to get all the tasks done or eject the imposter.
    I wouldn’t say it’s lost. It can still be fun that way considering it’ll become more of a hide & seek from that point forward. It sucks that it was ruined, but that’s an easy way to salvage the game
That's a good one!
Ooh, I like it.  Countering with their own shit.  Might buy some time, and even if the metagaming guy was crew and correct that yellow was imposter he deserves to get spaced anyway for metagaming
That just leads to "vote them and if not vote me" argument which is also stupid. Suiciding as an impostor is great if there are multiples. 

Imagine there are 2 impostors. You get caught in a kill and get a crewmember vented before you and you just took out at least 2 people. That leaves the other impostor 6v1, which isnt great, but not bad given how quickly some other random impostors get murdered.

Now imagine you take out before you suicide vent, your teammate and you take out 4 people. Then plus the vented crewmember you used "vote them and if not vote me" on, your lone teammate is at a 1v4. I really like those odds if I'm the lone impostor.
    That’s why I just do “I saw them kill x right in front of me.” Just as soon as the chat box comes up. With 2 imposters and no confirm I can make it work at least twice.

But I used the “saw them kill right in front of me” tactic 9v1 with confirm on and the one guy who stuck around too call a meeting after ejecting an innocent was the next victim. Next meeting was down to 3 and there was no accusation even leveled resulting in a skip vote. Had the other two remembered 5 minutes prior I would have lost.
        I was 1v3 and got seen killing. Blamed the other guy, saying "if not him then vote me next." 1v2, I'm hoping I can get the last kill before they can call the meeting. Right after, I check the meeting cooldown, it's 3 seconds shorter than my kill cooldown. Crap, I just lost. Except the 2 dumbasses immediately run off to do missions. Okay, I'll wait by the button and sabotage 02. As soon as they clear the emergency, I duck down to admin for the win.  
Like come on.. See the bigger picture. You know I'm the only imposter and I only need one more kill. If you call the meeting, you win. If my cooldown is shorter, you lose. If you don't hit the #@&$ button, you lose!
I do this, admin is incredibly useful when people are randomly wandering around to see if it was a self report by the killer, 2 blips, 1 blip and a report and you know they just self reported.
    Dead bodies still show up in admin on Skeld though, right? So how does this help?
        If there are only 2 blips and its reported the one that reported had to be the one that did it if nothing else has moved since.
            Yeah what I’m saying is you would have to sit and wait for a while. A dead body and someone who has three tasks in electrical look very similar unless you just sit at admin. Even then, someone walking in after and reporting would fit your criteria as it would appear as if two people were in there when they walked into a room with a dead body. 

This is assuming I am right about bodies appearing on admin map, which I’m fairly sure is right.
                He reported right when I popped out of the vent so it was in the span of like 3 seconds
This is how my friends play in public as well, I make sure my friends are typing in chat what we're saying in voice.

        We use an xbox chat cuz we don't all have discord but it's because there's only 2-4 of us, too small for a game. We have a code of honor though where we only speak during discussion rounds and make sure to type in the chat the things we suspect.
            Pretty much the same for us but we talk the whole time about non game related stuff and talk game stuff during votes. No reason to stay silent might as well have a convo.

And compromise isn't showing your belly and it's that exact mentality that leads others to think compromise is a bad word.  Look no further then virginia to see where small incremental change led to a blue virginia.  Shit sucks and I'm sorry it's not fixed right now this second BUT I will not support a movement who claims to have all the answers to fix all our problems and is unwilling to compromise with people.  That's what we got right now and I just really don't think it's as simple as: the other guy has all the answers.
You shouldn't have to plan around the lowest common denominator...but we do.

If people can fuck something up, there's some asshole out there willing to try
Happy cake day
Yes but the entire premise is to find the imposter and everyone knows who the imposter is then why would you play? It's not gonna be hard for the imposter to just kill everyone if they deliberately don't vote him off. Just end the match, kick the cheat and move on to the next one lmfao
    It turns into hide and seek which is actually pretty fun. The entire point is knowing the seeker/imposter and avoiding them while doing tasks at the same time. It kinda becomes dead by daylight in a way.
        Would be good to have a "hide-and-seek" voting option down next to skip.  When this sort of thing happens and a majority vote hide-and-seek the game changes modes, reduces vision and increases movement speed for crewmates (and the inverse for imposter), reduces kill timer, disables the emergency button and reporting, and away you go.
        I applaud the duck out of you guys who don’t let a cheater ruin your gaming experience.
    The premise is to NOT BE KILLED, not to find the imposter.  That is why you can easily win games (if everyone isn’t a dumbass) by doing your tasks.  

The objective is to live and get your team out of that area, not to necessarily find the imposter.
        EvErYoNe WhO dOeSn'T PlAy LiKe I dO iS a DuMbAsS....

The objective is to have fun, it's a game.  Winning easily isn't always the route one would want to take.  Others disagree.
    No the point is to get all the tasks done or eject the imposter.
I was 1v3 and got seen killing. Blamed the other guy, saying "if not him then vote me next." 1v2, I'm hoping I can get the last kill before they can call the meeting. Right after, I check the meeting cooldown, it's 3 seconds shorter than my kill cooldown. Crap, I just lost. Except the 2 dumbasses immediately run off to do missions. Okay, I'll wait by the button and sabotage 02. As soon as they clear the emergency, I duck down to admin for the win.  
Like come on.. See the bigger picture. You know I'm the only imposter and I only need one more kill. If you call the meeting, you win. If my cooldown is shorter, you lose. If you don't hit the #@&$ button, you lose!
If there are only 2 blips and its reported the one that reported had to be the one that did it if nothing else has moved since.
    Yeah what I’m saying is you would have to sit and wait for a while. A dead body and someone who has three tasks in electrical look very similar unless you just sit at admin. Even then, someone walking in after and reporting would fit your criteria as it would appear as if two people were in there when they walked into a room with a dead body. 

This is assuming I am right about bodies appearing on admin map, which I’m fairly sure is right.
        He reported right when I popped out of the vent so it was in the span of like 3 seconds
We use an xbox chat cuz we don't all have discord but it's because there's only 2-4 of us, too small for a game. We have a code of honor though where we only speak during discussion rounds and make sure to type in the chat the things we suspect.
    Pretty much the same for us but we talk the whole time about non game related stuff and talk game stuff during votes. No reason to stay silent might as well have a convo.
MRS OBAMA, GET DOWN
Aye, since if no-one's cheating, you can't report anything.
"Hi so I saw black venting" (he was)
