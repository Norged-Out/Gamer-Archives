[[How to catch the impostor.]]





This is funny until the imposter joins you behind the weapons task and kills one of you
    Not really, these 3 guys are buddies and did this to make a video. You can see all 3 of them have blank names while the rest of the people names are seen through the satellite. They must have tried this for a few games to get this clip.
        So lame. Had people chatting in discord yesterday. 2 people who would just relay who the killer is if one of them died.

*EMERGENCY MEETING*

Blue: "It was Black. I'm talking to Orange and he said Black killed him. Vote Black out. "

How is that fun???
            It’s so stupid lmao. I play with 3 friends on discord and if you die you stay muted the rest of the game. Why even play if you are just going to ruin the entire game.
                The weirdest thing is there's no incentive to winning either?? It's just for fun. No ranks or anything so what's the point of cheating?

                        some people cant handle not being the best and cheat their way to get there
                    You can say the same thing with bullying, there's no point except feeling proud to yourself

                    I’m pretty sure people do this so that they can end the game and continue playing with their friends, I don’t understand the fun of it either.
                Eh we let the dead talk but not about the game.
                    But it's kinda a mood breaker when everyone is focused on doing their tasks being silent n all and ghost people be like "so what did you guys have for dinner cause I made some amazing lasagne" or some shit
                        damn did they provide the recipe tho
                When I play with my friends, we stay muted except during meetings, and if you're dead you don't talk
                Whenever I come across this grossness, I try to convince the group to vote the spoiler out. 

This has mixed results. I think I’ve been ejected more because of it than any spoilers, sadly. 

But that’s what I get for playing public servers. Shrug emoji.
            Better than that one guy that had 5 friends in discord vote whoever he said (he was impostor) and then bragged about his win in the lobby after the game
            That's when you vote Blue because having information you're not supposed to have is sus.
            I love playing with friends and randoms at the same time but that shit is fucked up
            This happened to me as imposter, but one of them was the other imposter. 

I killed one and the other called a meeting and said "wtf white just killed my friend." 

So pointless.
            A few days ago I was in a game where an impostor messaged one of the dead innocents on discord to help them fake trash so we all saw the animation. Everyone else thought it was genius but I thought it was a bit shitty.
    Ooooh thank you!
how’d you make your names empty
    They don't have any names cause they are sus
        AmongSus
        Honestly it's an unintended mechanic that's not much fun. I'd rather name myself after people who ran for president so Al Gore or Grover Cleveland can be the imposter.
            *Abe Lincoln was not the imposter*

John Booths: Guys, I swear I saw him vent
                I've been sticking to less remarkable presidents actually. For some reason they make it even funnier to me.
            I joined a lobby with Hitler and a player named Soviet. They didn’t know each other. When they got imposter together NO ONE SUSPECTED THEM, one of the greatest wins I have witnessed
        what's sus?

new to among us. I started playing yesterday.
            Means you doing something suspect. They don't trust ya.
                Pretty sure it's short for suspicious but to be honest it doesn't matter what it's short for as long as we all know what it means.
                    I don't know. That's why i asked. it matters.

does it mean suspicious or suspect..


both words are different.
                        You are a suspect for doing something suspicius.
                        Depends on the sentence

I sus read -> suspect  
Red is sus -> suspicious
            It’s slang for being suspicious. Been around long before the game
            It's short for suspicious, and the term is used regularly in everyday speech among Australians.
    Emoji maybe

            Wait what
                ‍ 
Copy the test from my previous reply and you can paste it into your name box. It’s a blank space. Hopefully it’ll work in the game
                    is it the `&nbsp;` character? (no break space)
                        It is just a #
                            No, he typed something else, # only works with reddit comments
                                That’s my bad, i forgot the person was asking about the among us name. Sorry
                                    Understandable have a nice day
                                    That’s okay!

                            that will definitely not work
                        I use a blank character to name my folders on my iPhone. I just Google “blank text for iPhone” to get the character. 

[This site has it. ](https://iempty.tooliphone.net/copy-empty-text)
                        U+200D : ZERO WIDTH JOINER [ZWJ]
                        I dunno. Try &zwnj
                        I use Braille pattern dots zero (⠀) when I want to have a blank string because it is not counted as whitespace.
                            Just tried this and it doesn’t work

Edit: I just copied a Hangal Filler character from [**here**](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+3164) and pasted it in iOS and it worked
                    Doesn’t allow me to use it as a name

Edit:
This “ㅤ” works
                        ㅤ
                        Thanks that one works, and also I just copied the hangal filler character from [**here**](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+3164) and pasted it in iOS and it worked

                                Weird, worked for me
                        This should help: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2208399565
                    Works for me
                    Doesn’t work in game for me
                        it doesn't work on pc

            I know you can do this with a hashtag, but I don't see it when I reply. What is this sorcery?

            Think I found a hidden role one can play - ninja
            Only possible on phone? not pc?
                This guide shows you how to do it on PC: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2208399565
    Look up the character “Hangul Filler”. That should work.
        Thanks, I just copied it from [**here**](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+3164) and pasted it in iOS and it worked
        i dont see why you got 0 upvotes/downvotes, that does work and i tried it a few days ago

(btw with my upvote youre back to 1, positive)
            i dont see why you got -1 upvotes/downvotes, you were right about it working and I tried it just now

(btw with my upvote youre back to 0, positive)
        Thx korea
    idk if its the same thing but if you look up 'instagram blank space' and copy & paste it should work :)
    Just put ... as your  name, the game only does letters
    I would leave any lobby when I can't see proper names. I know it's funny as a meme but as a player meh.
        This is the first actual gameplay I have seen of this game, and I am very happy to hear that. I was confused why some of them could just hide there and it seemed like a big oversight.
            I think it could actually be a cool mechanic if your name disappeared after you hold still a second. Then anyone can hide and you’re on equal footing, not some people getting leg up with an unintended mechanic.
        Why do names matter? New to the game, just curious.
    This currently works
“ㅤ”
        “ㅤ” also works
            How many spaces are there?

Copy the "space" in-between the parentheses and paste it into the name column. This only works on mobile version as far as I know.

    Hello
Meanwhile I'm laughing because of their name "crot dalem", which is basically indonesian for creampie.
    Fucking incredible
        Fucking inedible
            No it’s very edible
                You give them to [children](https://youtu.be/KSXJfqkT36M)?!
            I am ~~inevitable~~ inedible
        Incredible fucking
    I’ve noticed something like half the people on public servers are Indonesian
        Never played public anymore after seeing how dumb the human race can be once.
            Unfortunately I don't have enough friends to play privately
            Pfft, watching the paranoia / chaos / mistrust / false hopes in public servers is all part of the joy.  Just roll with it and participate in the chaos.
        Nobody expects the ***Penjajahan Indonesia***
    huh
i used this with crewmate and won. When i used it to kill and hide...it worked so its also another way to get away with murder
    but how u get invisible username
        Just Google invisible characters. It's like some weird combination of alt + a number code like other special characters that aren't on the keyboard

Edit: alt+255
and if that doesnt work this site has all the unicode and html codes for different blank characters https://emptycharacter.com/

    Only works on mobile
        If it only works on mobile, would it work on bluestacks Pc?
            Nvm, got it working on pc by editing the file with your name
i do that all the time ive gotten like 15 imposters caught venting or killing

edit: shit I got so many upvotes lol
    Wow bush camper

            Bro copy that and search on google and tap the image tab. WTF is going on?

            Finally one that works. Thank you!
            thanks!
    Have you ever been caught with this as an imposter yourself?
        nope its worked for me but when you do it wait for imposter to leave or they might have killcooldown on 0 so dont run out as soon as you see them vent

            ... sus
    Lemon tree
        I damn love this song
    Lemon Tree from Fools Garden. It was one of my mothers favorite songs :)
    How does anyone NOT know that song though
noice
    Toit
I’d do it maybe once but it’d take the fun outta the game eventually
    Basically just an accepted form of cheating so
        There is just an easy counter you go behind as well as imPoster wait a little and kill one them hiding
Then you get a group where you all hide behind the disk and someone gets killed in the group
u/vredditdownloader
That is why I ban no name people
    But... its a great strat?
        It is an exploit
            Can't disagree with that
            So is going behind the dish with them as impostor and killing one of them right there.
                The no name people should get banned
Ngl Orange was actin sus anyways... any purple users here lol
‍
[deleted]
    Didn't know people were into that. But I don't judge. The song is called Lemon Tree and it's illegal for something to be such a vibe
        Strangely enough, that song seems to be very popular in Vietnam, which confused me as an American who never heard of it before and some friends asked me to sing it for karaoke.
            We literally translated this song's lyrics on my English classes at school. I was super weirded out to find out later in life that my bf doesn't know this song (we're from different countries).
            They play this song in Asia to teach English from what I've heard
                Interesting, if that's true, that would explain it.
Or you could just wait there and murder everyone that goes there. Even if they report the body, they might not see you hiding there.
    Pretty sure the name plate would still show through.  Then again you could just run a blank name like the guys in the gif.
        for me personally that doesn’t sound so much fun though.
            Then don't do it?  I was just telling someone else the plan would only work with a specific name.  I wasn't saying you had to do it.
I’ve always wanted to do that.
Its funny but its also cheating if you ask me. I mean this just takes all the fun out of the game if you allways do stuf like this
on PC you can open '%USERPROFILE% \\AppData\\LocalLow\\Innersloth\\**Among Us**\\playerprefs' with Notepad (or any text editor) and change your name (before first semicolon) to "ㅤ" (like below)  
`ㅤ,1,2,1,False,False,False,0,False,False,28,34,0,1,0,7,0,False,4,False`
Can anyone tell me how to get no name
    ‍
Yellow kinda sus though, just ran straight past the body.

I turn it turn it turn it around, and all that I can see, was just another lemon tree. Favourite song for a while
Me and my friends did this, but instead of hiding behind something, we all went to one spot in the cafeteria so our sprites would overlap perfectly. Then we scattered away from the body and laughed our asses off during the debate.
Am sure TSM Myth well debate and win

Lool. Once an imposter vented in cafeteria in front of everyone. Not even two minutes in game and it’s over.
how could you possibly coordinate this

I don't understand what happened
    They hid behind the satellite dish so it looked like an easy kill for the imposter. But they were really watching the whole time.

the music fits soo well
I saw one similar where *everyone* hid behind a guy in electrical and when the imposter killed him not only was one revealed, but many more. It was hilarious.
I had this happen in the security room where I stood on top of my Buddy so they couldn’t see more than one dude was there. Impostor popped in and murdled me and my buddy was left standing there to report.
Ayyyaaaa
How do you get no username???

Who made this video? Creds?
Something similar happened to me before,  two were standing on the same spot and appeared as one,  I killed one of them,  then saw the other one and my heart beats went from 0 to 100000, yet that idiot didn't see me and I won.
 ‍
Story: Saw a dude vent, he saw me and I raced back to emergency report. He killed me at the same time I pressed the button.

Will someone explain what’s going on?

Why is it funny seeing the imposter kill someone but then later other crewmates came out of hiding?

Not really, these 3 guys are buddies and did this to make a video. You can see all 3 of them have blank names while the rest of the people names are seen through the satellite. They must have tried this for a few games to get this clip.
    So lame. Had people chatting in discord yesterday. 2 people who would just relay who the killer is if one of them died.

*EMERGENCY MEETING*

Blue: "It was Black. I'm talking to Orange and he said Black killed him. Vote Black out. "

How is that fun???
        It’s so stupid lmao. I play with 3 friends on discord and if you die you stay muted the rest of the game. Why even play if you are just going to ruin the entire game.
            The weirdest thing is there's no incentive to winning either?? It's just for fun. No ranks or anything so what's the point of cheating?
                [deleted]
                    some people cant handle not being the best and cheat their way to get there
                You can say the same thing with bullying, there's no point except feeling proud to yourself
                [deleted]
                I’m pretty sure people do this so that they can end the game and continue playing with their friends, I don’t understand the fun of it either.
            Eh we let the dead talk but not about the game.
                But it's kinda a mood breaker when everyone is focused on doing their tasks being silent n all and ghost people be like "so what did you guys have for dinner cause I made some amazing lasagne" or some shit
                    damn did they provide the recipe tho
            When I play with my friends, we stay muted except during meetings, and if you're dead you don't talk
            Whenever I come across this grossness, I try to convince the group to vote the spoiler out. 

This has mixed results. I think I’ve been ejected more because of it than any spoilers, sadly. 

But that’s what I get for playing public servers. Shrug emoji.
        Better than that one guy that had 5 friends in discord vote whoever he said (he was impostor) and then bragged about his win in the lobby after the game
        That's when you vote Blue because having information you're not supposed to have is sus.
        I love playing with friends and randoms at the same time but that shit is fucked up
        This happened to me as imposter, but one of them was the other imposter. 

I killed one and the other called a meeting and said "wtf white just killed my friend." 

So pointless.
        A few days ago I was in a game where an impostor messaged one of the dead innocents on discord to help them fake trash so we all saw the animation. Everyone else thought it was genius but I thought it was a bit shitty.
Ooooh thank you!
They don't have any names cause they are sus
    AmongSus
    Honestly it's an unintended mechanic that's not much fun. I'd rather name myself after people who ran for president so Al Gore or Grover Cleveland can be the imposter.
        *Abe Lincoln was not the imposter*

John Booths: Guys, I swear I saw him vent
            I've been sticking to less remarkable presidents actually. For some reason they make it even funnier to me.
        I joined a lobby with Hitler and a player named Soviet. They didn’t know each other. When they got imposter together NO ONE SUSPECTED THEM, one of the greatest wins I have witnessed
    what's sus?

new to among us. I started playing yesterday.
        Means you doing something suspect. They don't trust ya.
            Pretty sure it's short for suspicious but to be honest it doesn't matter what it's short for as long as we all know what it means.
                I don't know. That's why i asked. it matters.

does it mean suspicious or suspect..


both words are different.
                    You are a suspect for doing something suspicius.
                    Depends on the sentence

I sus read -> suspect  
Red is sus -> suspicious
        It’s slang for being suspicious. Been around long before the game
        It's short for suspicious, and the term is used regularly in everyday speech among Australians.
Emoji maybe
     ‍
        Wait what
            ‍ 
Copy the test from my previous reply and you can paste it into your name box. It’s a blank space. Hopefully it’ll work in the game
                is it the `&nbsp;` character? (no break space)
                    It is just a #
                        No, he typed something else, # only works with reddit comments
                            That’s my bad, i forgot the person was asking about the among us name. Sorry
                                Understandable have a nice day
                                That’s okay!

                        that will definitely not work
                    I use a blank character to name my folders on my iPhone. I just Google “blank text for iPhone” to get the character. 

[This site has it. ](https://iempty.tooliphone.net/copy-empty-text)
                    U+200D : ZERO WIDTH JOINER [ZWJ]
                    I dunno. Try &zwnj
                    I use Braille pattern dots zero (⠀) when I want to have a blank string because it is not counted as whitespace.
                        Just tried this and it doesn’t work

Edit: I just copied a Hangal Filler character from [**here**](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+3164) and pasted it in iOS and it worked
                Doesn’t allow me to use it as a name

    i dont see why you got 0 upvotes/downvotes, that does work and i tried it a few days ago

(btw with my upvote youre back to 1, positive)
        i dont see why you got -1 upvotes/downvotes, you were right about it working and I tried it just now

(btw with my upvote youre back to 0, positive)
    Thx korea
idk if its the same thing but if you look up 'instagram blank space' and copy & paste it should work :)
Just put ... as your  name, the game only does letters
I would leave any lobby when I can't see proper names. I know it's funny as a meme but as a player meh.
    This is the first actual gameplay I have seen of this game, and I am very happy to hear that. I was confused why some of them could just hide there and it seemed like a big oversight.
        I think it could actually be a cool mechanic if your name disappeared after you hold still a second. Then anyone can hide and you’re on equal footing, not some people getting leg up with an unintended mechanic.
    Why do names matter? New to the game, just curious.
This currently works

Copy the "space" in-between the parentheses and paste it into the name column. This only works on mobile version as far as I know.

        I am ~~inevitable~~ inedible
    Incredible fucking
I’ve noticed something like half the people on public servers are Indonesian
    Never played public anymore after seeing how dumb the human race can be once.
        Unfortunately I don't have enough friends to play privately
        Pfft, watching the paranoia / chaos / mistrust / false hopes in public servers is all part of the joy.  Just roll with it and participate in the chaos.
    Nobody expects the ***Penjajahan Indonesia***
huh
but how u get invisible username
    Just Google invisible characters. It's like some weird combination of alt + a number code like other special characters that aren't on the keyboard

Edit: alt+255
and if that doesnt work this site has all the unicode and html codes for different blank characters https://emptycharacter.com/

Have you ever been caught with this as an imposter yourself?
    nope its worked for me but when you do it wait for imposter to leave or they might have killcooldown on 0 so dont run out as soon as you see them vent

Lemon tree
    I damn love this song
Lemon Tree from Fools Garden. It was one of my mothers favorite songs :)
How does anyone NOT know that song though
Toit
Basically just an accepted form of cheating so
    There is just an easy counter you go behind as well as imPoster wait a little and kill one them hiding
But... its a great strat?
    It is an exploit
        Can't disagree with that
        So is going behind the dish with them as impostor and killing one of them right there.
            The no name people should get banned
Didn't know people were into that. But I don't judge. The song is called Lemon Tree and it's illegal for something to be such a vibe
    Strangely enough, that song seems to be very popular in Vietnam, which confused me as an American who never heard of it before and some friends asked me to sing it for karaoke.
        We literally translated this song's lyrics on my English classes at school. I was super weirded out to find out later in life that my bf doesn't know this song (we're from different countries).
        They play this song in Asia to teach English from what I've heard
            Interesting, if that's true, that would explain it.
Pretty sure the name plate would still show through.  Then again you could just run a blank name like the guys in the gif.
    for me personally that doesn’t sound so much fun though.
        Then don't do it?  I was just telling someone else the plan would only work with a specific name.  I wasn't saying you had to do it.
‍

Copy and paste what is above
Fools Garden - Lemon Tree
    Thanks
Copy and paste that blank comment according to others on the thread
They hid behind the satellite dish so it looked like an easy kill for the imposter. But they were really watching the whole time.
So lame. Had people chatting in discord yesterday. 2 people who would just relay who the killer is if one of them died.

*EMERGENCY MEETING*

Blue: "It was Black. I'm talking to Orange and he said Black killed him. Vote Black out. "

How is that fun???
    It’s so stupid lmao. I play with 3 friends on discord and if you die you stay muted the rest of the game. Why even play if you are just going to ruin the entire game.
        The weirdest thing is there's no incentive to winning either?? It's just for fun. No ranks or anything so what's the point of cheating?
            [deleted]
                some people cant handle not being the best and cheat their way to get there
            You can say the same thing with bullying, there's no point except feeling proud to yourself
            [deleted]
            I’m pretty sure people do this so that they can end the game and continue playing with their friends, I don’t understand the fun of it either.
        Eh we let the dead talk but not about the game.
            But it's kinda a mood breaker when everyone is focused on doing their tasks being silent n all and ghost people be like "so what did you guys have for dinner cause I made some amazing lasagne" or some shit
                damn did they provide the recipe tho
        When I play with my friends, we stay muted except during meetings, and if you're dead you don't talk
        Whenever I come across this grossness, I try to convince the group to vote the spoiler out. 

This has mixed results. I think I’ve been ejected more because of it than any spoilers, sadly. 

But that’s what I get for playing public servers. Shrug emoji.
    Better than that one guy that had 5 friends in discord vote whoever he said (he was impostor) and then bragged about his win in the lobby after the game
    That's when you vote Blue because having information you're not supposed to have is sus.
    I love playing with friends and randoms at the same time but that shit is fucked up
    This happened to me as imposter, but one of them was the other imposter. 

I killed one and the other called a meeting and said "wtf white just killed my friend." 

So pointless.
    A few days ago I was in a game where an impostor messaged one of the dead innocents on discord to help them fake trash so we all saw the animation. Everyone else thought it was genius but I thought it was a bit shitty.
AmongSus
Honestly it's an unintended mechanic that's not much fun. I'd rather name myself after people who ran for president so Al Gore or Grover Cleveland can be the imposter.
    *Abe Lincoln was not the imposter*

John Booths: Guys, I swear I saw him vent
        I've been sticking to less remarkable presidents actually. For some reason they make it even funnier to me.
    I joined a lobby with Hitler and a player named Soviet. They didn’t know each other. When they got imposter together NO ONE SUSPECTED THEM, one of the greatest wins I have witnessed
what's sus?

new to among us. I started playing yesterday.
    Means you doing something suspect. They don't trust ya.
        Pretty sure it's short for suspicious but to be honest it doesn't matter what it's short for as long as we all know what it means.
            I don't know. That's why i asked. it matters.

does it mean suspicious or suspect..


both words are different.
                You are a suspect for doing something suspicius.
                Depends on the sentence

I sus read -> suspect  
Red is sus -> suspicious
    It’s slang for being suspicious. Been around long before the game
    It's short for suspicious, and the term is used regularly in everyday speech among Australians.
 ‍
    Wait what
        ‍ 
Copy the test from my previous reply and you can paste it into your name box. It’s a blank space. Hopefully it’ll work in the game
            is it the `&nbsp;` character? (no break space)
                It is just a #
                    No, he typed something else, # only works with reddit comments
                        That’s my bad, i forgot the person was asking about the among us name. Sorry
                            Understandable have a nice day
                            That’s okay!

                I use a blank character to name my folders on my iPhone. I just Google “blank text for iPhone” to get the character.

    i dont see why you got -1 upvotes/downvotes, you were right about it working and I tried it just now

Thx korea
This is the first actual gameplay I have seen of this game, and I am very happy to hear that. I was confused why some of them could just hide there and it seemed like a big oversight.
    I think it could actually be a cool mechanic if your name disappeared after you hold still a second. Then anyone can hide and you’re on equal footing, not some people getting leg up with an unintended mechanic.
Why do names matter? New to the game, just curious.
“ㅤ” also works
    How many spaces are there?
What so bad about being named hit

Copy the "space" in-between the parentheses and paste it into the name column. This only works on mobile version as far as I know.

Incredible fucking
Never played public anymore after seeing how dumb the human race can be once.
    Unfortunately I don't have enough friends to play privately
    Pfft, watching the paranoia / chaos / mistrust / false hopes in public servers is all part of the joy.  Just roll with it and participate in the chaos.
Nobody expects the ***Penjajahan Indonesia***
Just Google invisible characters. It's like some weird combination of alt + a number code like other special characters that aren't on the keyboard

Edit: alt+255
and if that doesnt work this site has all the unicode and html codes for different blank characters https://emptycharacter.com/

If it only works on mobile, would it work on bluestacks Pc?

    thanks!
nope its worked for me but when you do it wait for imposter to leave or they might have killcooldown on 0 so dont run out as soon as you see them vent
bruh my comment is not a video
/u/vredditdownloader
It's not a rickroll
    Even if it’s not, this comment makes it seem like it is...
    ... sus
I damn love this song
There is just an easy counter you go behind as well as imPoster wait a little and kill one them hiding
It is an exploit
    Can't disagree with that
    So is going behind the dish with them as impostor and killing one of them right there.
        The no name people should get banned
Strangely enough, that song seems to be very popular in Vietnam, which confused me as an American who never heard of it before and some friends asked me to sing it for karaoke.
    We literally translated this song's lyrics on my English classes at school. I was super weirded out to find out later in life that my bf doesn't know this song (we're from different countries).
    They play this song in Asia to teach English from what I've heard
        Interesting, if that's true, that would explain it.
for me personally that doesn’t sound so much fun though.
    Then don't do it?  I was just telling someone else the plan would only work with a specific name.  I wasn't saying you had to do it.
Thanks
It’s so stupid lmao. I play with 3 friends on discord and if you die you stay muted the rest of the game. Why even play if you are just going to ruin the entire game.
    The weirdest thing is there's no incentive to winning either?? It's just for fun. No ranks or anything so what's the point of cheating?
        [deleted]
            some people cant handle not being the best and cheat their way to get there
        You can say the same thing with bullying, there's no point except feeling proud to yourself
        [deleted]
        I’m pretty sure people do this so that they can end the game and continue playing with their friends, I don’t understand the fun of it either.
    Eh we let the dead talk but not about the game.
        But it's kinda a mood breaker when everyone is focused on doing their tasks being silent n all and ghost people be like "so what did you guys have for dinner cause I made some amazing lasagne" or some shit
            damn did they provide the recipe tho
    When I play with my friends, we stay muted except during meetings, and if you're dead you don't talk
    Whenever I come across this grossness, I try to convince the group to vote the spoiler out. 

This has mixed results. I think I’ve been ejected more because of it than any spoilers, sadly. 

But that’s what I get for playing public servers. Shrug emoji.
Better than that one guy that had 5 friends in discord vote whoever he said (he was impostor) and then bragged about his win in the lobby after the game
That's when you vote Blue because having information you're not supposed to have is sus.
I love playing with friends and randoms at the same time but that shit is fucked up
This happened to me as imposter, but one of them was the other imposter. 

I killed one and the other called a meeting and said "wtf white just killed my friend." 

So pointless.
A few days ago I was in a game where an impostor messaged one of the dead innocents on discord to help them fake trash so we all saw the animation. Everyone else thought it was genius but I thought it was a bit shitty.
*Abe Lincoln was not the imposter*

John Booths: Guys, I swear I saw him vent
    I've been sticking to less remarkable presidents actually. For some reason they make it even funnier to me.
I joined a lobby with Hitler and a player named Soviet. They didn’t know each other. When they got imposter together NO ONE SUSPECTED THEM, one of the greatest wins I have witnessed
Means you doing something suspect. They don't trust ya.
    Pretty sure it's short for suspicious but to be honest it doesn't matter what it's short for as long as we all know what it means.
        I don't know. That's why i asked. it matters.

does it mean suspicious or suspect..


both words are different.
            You are a suspect for doing something suspicius.
            Depends on the sentence

I sus read -> suspect  
Red is sus -> suspicious
It’s slang for being suspicious. Been around long before the game
It's short for suspicious, and the term is used regularly in everyday speech among Australians.
Wait what
    ‍ 
Copy the test from my previous reply and you can paste it into your name box. It’s a blank space. Hopefully it’ll work in the game
        is it the `&nbsp;` character? (no break space)
            It is just a #
                No, he typed something else, # only works with reddit comments
                    That’s my bad, i forgot the person was asking about the among us name. Sorry
                        Understandable have a nice day
                        That’s okay!

            I use a blank character to name my folders on my iPhone. I just Google “blank text for iPhone” to get the character. 

[This site has it. ](https://iempty.tooliphone.net/copy-empty-text)

            I dunno. Try &zwnj
            I use Braille pattern dots zero (⠀) when I want to have a blank string because it is not counted as whitespace.

Edit: I just copied a Hangal Filler character from [**here**](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+3164) and pasted it in iOS and it worked

Think I found a hidden role one can play - ninja
Only possible on phone? not pc?
    This guide shows you how to do it on PC: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2208399565
i dont see why you got -1 upvotes/downvotes, you were right about it working and I tried it just now

(btw with my upvote youre back to 0, positive)
I think it could actually be a cool mechanic if your name disappeared after you hold still a second. Then anyone can hide and you’re on equal footing, not some people getting leg up with an unintended mechanic.
How many spaces are there?

    The no name people should get banned
We literally translated this song's lyrics on my English classes at school. I was super weirded out to find out later in life that my bf doesn't know this song (we're from different countries).
They play this song in Asia to teach English from what I've heard
    Interesting, if that's true, that would explain it.
Then don't do it?  I was just telling someone else the plan would only work with a specific name.  I wasn't saying you had to do it.
The weirdest thing is there's no incentive to winning either?? It's just for fun. No ranks or anything so what's the point of cheating?

    I’m pretty sure people do this so that they can end the game and continue playing with their friends, I don’t understand the fun of it either.
Eh we let the dead talk but not about the game.
    But it's kinda a mood breaker when everyone is focused on doing their tasks being silent n all and ghost people be like "so what did you guys have for dinner cause I made some amazing lasagne" or some shit
        damn did they provide the recipe tho
When I play with my friends, we stay muted except during meetings, and if you're dead you don't talk
Whenever I come across this grossness, I try to convince the group to vote the spoiler out. 

This has mixed results. I think I’ve been ejected more because of it than any spoilers, sadly. 

But that’s what I get for playing public servers. Shrug emoji.
I've been sticking to less remarkable presidents actually. For some reason they make it even funnier to me.
Pretty sure it's short for suspicious but to be honest it doesn't matter what it's short for as long as we all know what it means.
    I don't know. That's why i asked. it matters.

does it mean suspicious or suspect..


both words are different.
        You are a suspect for doing something suspicius.
        Depends on the sentence

I sus read -> suspect  
Red is sus -> suspicious
‍ 
Copy the test from my previous reply and you can paste it into your name box. It’s a blank space. Hopefully it’ll work in the game
    is it the `&nbsp;` character? (no break space)
        It is just a #
            No, he typed something else, # only works with reddit comments
                That’s my bad, i forgot the person was asking about the among us name. Sorry
                    Understandable have a nice day
                    That’s okay!

        I use a blank character to name my folders on my iPhone. I just Google “blank text for iPhone” to get the character.

I use a blank character to name my folders on my iPhone. I just Google “blank text for iPhone” to get the character. 

[This site has it. ](https://iempty.tooliphone.net/copy-empty-text)
U+200D : ZERO WIDTH JOINER [ZWJ]
I dunno. Try &zwnj
I use Braille pattern dots zero (⠀) when I want to have a blank string because it is not counted as whitespace.
    Just tried this and it doesn’t work

Edit: I just copied a Hangal Filler character from [**here**](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+3164) and pasted it in iOS and it worked
