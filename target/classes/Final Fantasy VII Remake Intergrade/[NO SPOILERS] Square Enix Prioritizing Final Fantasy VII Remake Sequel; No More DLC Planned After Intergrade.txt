I'm glad about that. I'd rather they focus on the main story anyways. I don't want another FFXV incident. Having small bits of content between installments are okay, but not necessary.
    Usually dev teams split after a big release, with part of the team making DLC using assets from the original game, while the rest of the team sets up the groundwork for the sequel. So they're not unnecessary either.
    I want a mode where you play the original story as a remake and then the new spin is new game+
        This would amazing. Two games in one essentially lol
    Didnt they get content cancelled they promised?  or did they actually deliver?  Was bout to start playing that yesterday actually lol.  But ADD too powerful ._.
        Yeah FFXV had a ton of content cut out of the main game with the promise of a ton of dlc, that also got cut in half.
        There were 3 dlc cancelled with one being turned into a light novel, due to the director leaving Square Enix pretty abruptly. It wasn't originally planned for the game, as it was a second season pass announced pretty far out after the game released. The original planned season pass along with a myriad of patches, free content, and the Royal expansion was still added to the game over the first couple years. So the extra content that got cancelled was just DLC conceptualised far after release in the first place, not so much stuff that they promised from before launch or anything vital to the game
            Thought he left becauuuuuuuuuse they were cancelled? O_O
                Wouldn't hold my breath for a definitive answer from Square Enix about that situation, they are a japanese company, and Tabata probably signed a non disclosure agreement upon leaving.

We will never know if Square decided to cancel the second season pass and Tabata felt that was unacceptable because it was promised to fans already after so many issues, or if it was the other way around, Tabata deciding to just leave which made Square cancel the remaining DLCs.

Personally I feel the first one is more plausible since most content post Ignis was made without Tabata as a director anyway, they could have clearly worked without him, I mean the project continued without Nomura in the first place anyway.
                    Yeah I think it's the first as they are probably trying to make us believe something to be true even it isn't to prevent backlash and Tabata can't say a word because non disclosure agreement. Necessary evil those non disclosure agreements are.
                        Doesnt he still work under square just running the luminous engine Studios that square owns? I wouldnt expect there to have been some big fallout where he had to sign a NDA since technically he is still employed through SE
                            He left both Square and Luminous Productions, Square was aparently impressed with his performance with FFXV, he took a project on the verge of being cancelled, rebooted it, released it in only 3 years of development with the new engine and came out with a success (despite it's flaws of course). So around the time of release of Episode Prompto or Episode Ignis, Square created Luminous Productions and made him the leading guy of that team. Really nice position, which makes his departure so strange. He left at the time of the new wave of DLCs being cancelled for unconfirmed reasons.
                                Why do you think those reasons are unconfirmed though? My mom always said if you had nothing good to say don't say anything at all.
                                    Just how big companies handle things, they don't usually talk about why someone left or was let go, despite all the brand damage Don Mattrick did to Xbox he was still simply "transfered" to Zynga, not fired. The original director for version 1.0 of FFXIV wasn't fired either, he was simply moved to a different position.

There are so many possible reasons for him leaving and so little to go from. Maybe there was drama, maybe there was none at all and it was simply Tabata wanting to pursue a different career path. Maybe they wanted to cancel the DLCs  for a while, and Tabata leaving was the perfect excuse. Who knows.
                            You always signed a Non Disclosure agreement with a company when making something like a video game. Keeps you from leaking the game out or telling too much about it that won't be in the game. I really don't think Square Enix didn't want to put anymore funds in the game.
                                Yea I agree. Even though I love the game, I think SE and the majority of the fan base was ready to move on. Cant wait to see what they have in store for Forspoken. Wish they would have just kept the name Project Athia. Sounds better to me
                                    I mean some fans actually thought they were going to "finish" the game though even if it had a very unrealistic amount of work. Some fans thought of it as a promise with unrealistic expectations. How about not having a game go into development hell? You could say that "Well they needed all hands on deck to fix FF14!" which again is also Square Enix's in a way. Why should other projects suffer because someone else messed up? I just think it's wrong.
            yeah when they announced season 2 i was really surprised because I thought all was said and done for the game at that point.
    I couldn't agree more. The main game itself could've been so much better if they hadn't broken the idea of it into an anime and other stuff. I wish they had just found a way to combine it all together.
    Nono, you're good, they don't release unfinished messes and patch in relevant story parts later behind paywalls... Hajime tabata left a few years ago

*airhorn soundeffect*

*runs away*
        To be fair it wasn't all Tabata's fault. He was getting an average of 2 hours of sleep and upper management was not nice to him. (That's what I've heard anyways)

But you have a point that this isn't the same team in any way. Yet it is still a concern for many. Fans were burned badly so some will be worried naturally.
            Heheh it was more of a silly joke on my part, plus it always surprised me how nomura gets so much shit for his style, yet every game he's credited on are wild successes, while excuses were being made (and rightly so, I just felt the same should be extended nomura, which it rarely is) for tabata who's credits are generally among the least popular games
                To be fair considering FFXV's development hell, Tabata only got put in the position he did because Nomura kept changing things up, which delayed KH3, XV, *and* 7r. He had to make due with what he had.

Going by KH3's re:Mind DLC ending, Nomura is still very salty over being removed from XV.
                    Ngl, I lost interest in KH3 halfway between games, I dunno how cause I used to love the series, but I own it, just can't bring myself to finish it, so I haven't seen re:mind.

But having gorged on all available info on 15 and the dev history of it, I can definitely understand why he is salty. I know its never ever going to happen, but I would've loved a XV Nomura cut heheh.

And yeah, Tabata definitely had an uphill battle, and it's understandable why the game shipped in the state it did, HOWEVER, if I worked on a script, outline, functioning engine that needed a lot of work for nearly a decade, and our bosses takes that from me and gives it to you telling you you have 1 year to finish it, would your solution be to scrap a decade of work, and just start over?

Point is, Tabata didn't have nearly enough time, but he kinda threw the baby out with the bathwater, it'd take way less time to untangle the mess 2 console generations had done with the engine and just finish it, than do it all on an unrealistic schedule.

Even annual games are only able to be annual because they switch up studios or reuse assets like crazy, they don't build an entire 50hr rpg with cutting edge tech from scratch
Square handled this very well. I also have to give them credit for making the PS5 upgrade free. I honestly wasn't expecting that. Obviously DLC content like Yuffie you expect to have to pay for. I'm really looking forward to playing it again when all of this is released.
    I have no issue paying for the DLC if the content is good.
        TBH I was planning on buying the PS5 version even if it came without DLC because I'm a simp for FF7, so this is great news. 

Hopefully this kind of approach from SE shows that they're being bold, pragmatic and innovative with FF7R rather than going a more cautious, traditional route - which would've been understandable given the OG's legacy.
            i mean dlc thats worth 2 chapters (est 2 hours) of content? which you can squeeze and grind out to more? i agree dlc gonna be dope
        I can already tell you now it's going to be good. But the chances are high that it's not going to be technically worth it considering how much it adds and price/playtime wise. Like I expect to be done with it 8 times faster and pay about 2/5 of the main game. DLC is in my eyes made to squeeze money from the fans, such as myself who cannot resist more content.
        No question. It's safe to say this will be.
            [deleted]
                Indeed. With Intergrade, FFXVI, Forspoken, Outriders and the continuation of the Remake, these next couple of years are going to be gold for Square. Are they "back"? Time will tell, but I am hopeful.
                    FF14 has been amazing too since 2015 with all the expansions, a mile better than the base game.
                        FF14 is not just amazing - it’s honestly become one of my favorite entries in the entire franchise. It’s something special.

I feel like such a fool for thinking of it as “just another MMO” for years before I started playing.
                            I heard people say that for years and it kept me persisting with the game, I struggled through ARR and especially the inbetween quests before Heavensward. Then you get a flying mount and the writing dramatically improves and suddenly it's incredible. I wish they would cut out more of ARR so its easier to get into, like cut 50% more.
                                With a fairly recent patch, they did remove quite a bit of the “filler” from the base game and the epilogue leading into Heavensward! That content is still nowhere near as excellent as everything which follows it, but it’s definitely more streamlined now. 

Like you said though, Heavensward is when the game really began to hit its stride. The storytelling from that point on is not just the best I’ve seen in an MMO, it’s some of the best I’ve seen in an RPG, period.
                        Yes. That's why I'm honestly not at all worried about XVI not being quality. I think at the very *least* it will be good.
                            I just hope the combat takes influence from 7R.
                                We’ll see. As a DmC vet tho, watching that trailer gave me some hardcore DMC/Bayonetta vibes. I’m hoping they take the DMC5 route and have multiple playable characters all who feel different from eachother
                                It might. Although with the combat director being of DMC fame, it might lean more towards that. A hybrid of the two isn't out of the question.
                                    It just has to have a playable party and strategy in combat. I assume SE realise that after the reception to 7R, but I'm a little nervous.
                    Nier Automata, DQXI, KH3+Remind and FFVIIR. For me they came back.
                        Yeah, fair enough. They did a great job with the re-release of DQXI. They added *a lot* to it. Hopefully it continues and there's another Golden Age ahead for them here.
                    Don't forget!!! Dragon Quest XII is also in development currently so expect that within the next year or two, honestly can't wait!
                        That soon? Nice! DQXI was my first game of the series and I really enjoyed it. I loved the locations and it just had a lot of charm to it. At the time I was really in the mood for a turn based RPG and this game really scratched that itch.

                        Same. Some of my best early gaming memories were courtesy of Squaresoft.
                    It’s certainly improvement from PS3 era.
                        Yeah, that was rock bottom for them, even though I thought the XIII games were alright, but definitely not the quality we had been used to.
                    And the Nier remaster/remake! AAAAAAaaaaaa 24 days left
                        Yes! So other than the protagonist being the brother and not the father, are there any other changes in Replicant? Do thinks play out exactly the same otherwise?
                            It should. Combat is remade from the ground up and the soundtrack and voice acting are redone but story and locations should be mostly the same. I do hope that the word system is changed but we'll have to see.
                                OK. Yeah, I'm really looking forward to going back in. It's been such a long time since I played the original Nier and it was a unique experience. I'm really glad Square is bringing Replicant over.
        Exactly. You'll never hear me complain about paying for Hearts of Stone or Blood and Wine. They were worth every penny, and everything that DLC should aspire to be. If Integrade comes even close to living up to either of those I am 100% thrilled. I mean hell, Blood and Wine was my GotY as an expansion, lol.
        And not just good.. a genuine supplement to the game, rather than part of the game that should have been there without the extra charge.  I paid for the DLC for Horizon: Zero Dawn and was satisfied, but I don't feel the same way about Yuffie because she was in the original game, sidequest or not.  I'm glad they're not taking that further.
        You will if it delays part 2 for 3 more years
            They have said they’re going to focus on part 2 rather than DLC.
        New and Good and correctly adds to story
    They haven’t had a single miss on the remake stuff yet honestly. The core game was awesome, the PS5 upgrade is amazing, and the Yuffie DLC seems like it will be juuuuust enough and lets us get familiar with a new character’s mechanics before they join in P2.
        Plus a proper Super Boss in the form of Weiss for pure fan-service and giving us that kind of KH Final Mix type of challenge where we can test our skills against secret bosses that hint at the next game and story beats, etc. I always loved the Final Mixes so having a sort of FF VII Final Mix in between each game is honestly perfect.
            Yo I did not even think of the final mix parallel with secret super bosses. Let Weiss be as challenging as Lingering Will was the first time I tried it. Please SE...
            >I always loved the Final Mixes so having a sort of FF VII Final Mix in between each game is honestly perfect.

But that won't happen anymore. He just told us this. 😐
                Uhhhh...no...no he didn't. He just said there will be no more DLC after Intergrade and they're focusing on Part 2. And then I 100% guarantee that after Part 2, it will also have another in-between version similar to Intergrade which will be its "Final Mix." 

Intergrade is already a Final Mix, it has new story beats, cutscenes, some enhancements here and there, fixes, new areas and new Post-Game content (like secret bosses, hence why they added Weiss into it.) 

It's exactly the same thing, it's from the same director. I always assumed he would do this between games because it keeps people a bit satiated until the next game. He hasn't ruled out doing this for every single part at all, all he stated was that they are now focusing on Part 2 and Intergrade is the only DLC coming for Part 1...which makes complete and total sense.
                    Wrong.

Nomura: "The roadwork we have laid out to complete the entire story takes priority, and if we are to ever add DLC, it will not be until after everything has been done."

The entire story. Not just a portion of the story(Part 2), but the entire thing.
                        You read into it waaaayyyy too much but feel free to remind me in a couple years when I'm inevitably right and we get a Part 2 equivalent of Intergrade.
        Yeah, actually, in my initial post, I didn't even mention the great job they've already done with the first part. 😆 But, yeah, it'll be nice to get some "hold over" content. I'm even including Ever Crisis in that which could be really good. Battle royal games like First Soldier aren't really my cup of tea, but I hope it does alright.
    I'm pretty sure you still have to pay for the Yuffie DLC. Only the PS5 upgrade is free.
        Yes, I said that. 😏
            Oh, yes, you did!
        Do you really? I thought it was included with the PS5 upgrade for free
            If you upgrade from a ps4 version it's not included
                Everything I had read said only the free ps plus version wasn’t free? I can’t find anything clarifying it either way so now I’m confused
                You’re right, just found an article that specified that
    Except they didn't handle it well, because all the people who bought the game can't buy the DLC due to it being on PS5. I'm still pissed off about that.
        Understandable. This was basically Square ripping off the bandaid and saying that the rest of the parts are not going to be on PS4. That is not surprising since the old hardware held back the first game (it's still a good looking game, though). But, people have the right to be upset as the PS4 is a large user base to ignore. With the PS5 launch being what it is, hopefully in another year or so PS5s will be more readily available. I mean, I get they wanted to use this to show off experiment with PS5 features, but it is odd to just not release a PS4 version as well. This could've been partly a SONY decision to help move more PS5 units.
        considering the PS4 version had awful load time and egregious texture disparities that were actually a bug they couldn't fix, why would you expect them to release DLC with the same problems due to the console it's on?
            Well they released the actual game on PS4 so obviously that stuff didn't matter to them, right?
                It was a sacrifice due to technical limitation that 100% bothered them lol. It’s like feeling ok about showing up to work in sweat pants just because you’re also wearing a dress shirt and tie... why limit themselves with the problems of last gen when they can solve the issues and get people to buy the console they will need for the next game in the series?
    >Obviously DLC content like Yuffie you expect to have to pay for.

No, Yuffie was part of the original game, with no extra charge.  I only expect to pay more now because that's where companies are heading more and more, and it's infuriating.
        She was in the original game, but really wasn't a major character. She will be now and she's getting more exposition, and we'll see how her actions in Midgar had an affect on the story for the first part that we didn't see. I think the fact they're taking the time to make a minor character in the original and actually have her have a bigger impact in the story is worth it. We'll probably get something similar for the next part, perhaps with Vincent.
        The OG was a single 40-80 hour game. The Remake series is not the same amount of content, not even close, drawing equivalence like that is silly.
        Well, yes, but she was extra content and completely missable. The end FMV doesn't have her for that reason. If VII was made today, she would be a dlc character through and through.

Same with Vincent. You can cut both out and not lose out on the VII experience. 

Yuffie is one of my favorites so I'm glad she got her own DLC and she's in the game, but she isn't a core part of the original.
    Why would content for Yuffie *obviously* be a paid DLC?  They’re taking creative liberties with this new remake so why would her remake story cost more than the base $180 we are already going to be paying?  Shiittt, they should be throwing extra content at ya for that price lol.  I’m a FF7 simp and a half but paid DLC is a ridiculous notion for what amounts to a $180 story.
        "ridiculous notion"? you want a product, you have to pay for it. they have to pay the people that put in the time to make this product. they do not owe you anything just because you paid them $60 a year ago.
            ....And that’s your opinion.
        It could be worse, it could be the FFXV model. Yeah, they're going to milk you with this. I think everyone saw this coming. If you have the PS4 version, you're getting the upgrade for free and paying a bit extra for a few more hours of story. I really don't think it's that big of a deal. This is all they're doing. They are working hard on the next part.
    If I had FF7R downloaded on my PS4, then set it aside and have a PS5 now, how will I be able to download the upgraded game and/or DLC on the PS5? My account will be recognized as purchasing the PS4 version and just download automatically once I go to the download page and select download PS5 version?

Also then you have a game that doesn't have my save files etc on a PS5 now? I have to replay the game on PS5 just to access DLC?
        So, you don't have the PS4 installed now? If not, redownload it, then it'll upgrade when the update is released. The only version of the game that's not eligible for the upgrade is the free one that was made available through PS recently.

If you don't have a save anywhere then you're going to have to start over. The PS4 saves will work for the PS5 version after the upgrade.
            Nope, we moved and I figured I had no need for the PS4 anymore so it's been in storage.

Thanks for the info -- 

1) re-download on PS5 through my existing account/prior PS4 purchase. (will have my saves)  
2) Game will auto update when PS5 update comes and I can buy DLC.

Is this accurate?
                Yes.
                    Great, thanks for the help.
I think the Intergrade also wasn't planned as DLC, however, they did want to upgrade the Remake to PS5, and just a plain upgrade wasn't probably worth the time, so the upgrade was wrapped into a DLC. I wonder just how much extra playtime there is...
    This and also the DLC will he a testing ground for features on ps5 going forward.
        It's a good way to figure out fixes to the original and allows them to play with some new ideas for the next part. I noticed there seem to be team-up moves that were not present in the base game. Probably seeing what might work so the next game will rock.
    It's very very normal for developers to have part of the main team make DLC between installments, there's no reason to think this wasn't planned.
        Well typically game companies dont outright lie, only on rare occasions. They stated there would be no DLC before part 1 dropped, yet here we are. 

Technically you cant buy it separately so I guess it's not actually DLC but added content to the ps5 version
            Huh I never saw that statement, any idea how to find it? I'm very surprised I missed it.
    > I think the Intergrade also wasn't planned as DLC...

Hmmm... I don't know for sure, of course, but I am thinking they plan to do DLC for both Yuffie and Vincent. That way they can flesh out their related stories on the side without affecting the A plot of FF7R.

Neither of them are integral to the A plot and they could have them join up with the main party during the final part of FF7R, likely without the DLC being a necessity. 

Definitely some wishful thinking here on my part. (Please keep that Deepground shit far away from me lol.) I never cared for either characters in OGFF7 so I could skip the DLCs if they play it this way.

That's my hot take~

EDIT: Whelp, after the news today that theory/hope is busted. 😬
    I think it was mentioned in a previous interview with Nomura that Intergrade will only be 2 chapters long, but I'm not sure if it was confirmed that the chapters would be the same length as in Remake. I'd assume a 2-5 hour run would be expected. Post-episode content not yet confirmed, though.
i'm glad there's only 1 dlc
    I'm gonna mark this as spoilers just in case but, >!we still have another optional character, Vincent, so I suspect we will continue receiving DLC at least for him in later parts!<
        To be fair >!I sort of doubt either Yuffie or Vincent will be optional this time around. There was a charm to older Final Fantasies that had optional/secret characters, but I imagine with how much work it is to implement fully voiced, playable characters and how much more complicated the storytelling is, especially if they continue to pull in spin-offs where Yuffie and Vincent weren't optional, then there's no logical way they can be optional secret characters in Remake.!<

If there's more DLC, though, it could be a great way to start working with characters we probably won't see for awhile. >!I don't know how they'd do it, but it could be a way to raise hype about Cid, or Vincent, or even Cait Sith if we're not going to see them for awhile.!< Could also be fun to have DLC that explores some of the backstories of the characters we already have. I would've thought it'd be cool to have a Red XIII DLC that goes into his >!pre-Midgar solo adventure and ends with him getting captured by Hojo.!<
            Fair points, and I don't think any character will be optional this time, but I wanted to point out that Bioware has def laid the groundwork for how to do awesome, fully realized party members with storylines who are optional.
                Oh, for sure. I personally love secret/optional characters. I remember playing Dragon Age Origins >!and my brother was shocked that I had Wynne in my party. He thought she was just some random old lady you were supposed to kill when you encountered her in the tower.!< I also miss the days of like, Final Fantasy VI when there were TONS of optional characters, I don't think I ever would've found some of them if not for a guide.
        There is no way that yuffie/vincent will be optional characters.
            I mean considering Yuffie is already DLC, its plausible
I recently watched a Did You Know Gaming episode for Remake, and while many of the findings covered familiar topics with the development of the game, one revelation that stuck with me was that Nomura realized the team’s mortality—and how with Nojima and Kitase being much older than him, any further delays with the project could have affected the quality of the project and therefore, necessitated the original team to work on it along with the younger staff.

So, it’s good to get a confirmation that the Remake sequel, or sequels perhaps, will be prioritized while keeping this context in mind. They want to pour in all of their efforts before age and time catch up to them and affect their work output. Perhaps the entire Remake project will become their magnum opus. And if this is the case, I’ll support them however I can.
    Yep, that was part of the motivation for them to start the Remake project in the first place. It was a "now or never" situation.

I forget who said this, but another famous game developer said something similar that us consumers never really consider. There are only so many games that a developer gets to work on in one lifetime. Working on even one project that you're not passionate about or one that fails to deliver can feel like years wasted. Even in a long 30 or 40-year career, that has to be extremely painful. It's definitely given me greater appreciation for the good things that games do so that I focus less on the things that I dislike or think are lacking. Sometimes I feel like some gamers focus way too much on the negative and end up disregarding the positives.
This is the absolute correct choice and other studios should follow this example.
Nothing too shocking here, but it's good to have it officially confirmed. Yuffie's chapter definitely feels like it is meant to encourage a second playthrough on PS5 and wet your appetite for further games; it definitely doesn't look like it would be the new way of distributing FF7 content or anything.
I think the best thing about this dlc is that it's on ps5.

Before you hate me, let me explain. 

I'm not going to be able to afford a ps5 for this dlc so you think I would be salty. Definitely not, as this is an excellent way to test what they can pull out of the bag on ps5. A poor DLC is nowhere near as bad publicity as a poor full game. First time on ps5, if they make any bad decisions I want it to be found in a dlc, and fixed before part 2 comes out.
    I disagree that this is going to show what a PS5 is capable of considering they are using a PS4 game for the DLC. 

I do agree however that they can test some ideas out. For example Yuffie. Incase there are issue with the character's gameplay they can make it better for the main game. 

Also maybe they can tweak current systems or test new ones.
        Yea exactly, the first games on a new system never come close to the ones at the end of its life (I'm sure there are exceptions) put breath of fire 3 against FFIX on ps1 for example, obviously things have come a long way but if square enix can get a foot in the door from this DLC to work out some kinks, it's worth it.
            > ...this is an excellent way to test what they can pull out of the bag on ps5.

I thought you were saying the dlc was gonna show off what the PS5 is capable of with this comment. My bad if I misrepresented your opinion. 

My expectations for the DLC is that the most "power" we are going to get from the PS5 is the resolution and fps upgrades already stated.
it sucks that i bought a physical copy of FF7R and the discless ps5...

Now I have to buy ff7R again just to play the dlc...
    isn’t it currently free on psn plus?
        the ps plus version won't get the upgrade to the ps5 version. this and ps plus requires an ongoing subscription.
            well that sucks!
I figured the original launch for PS4 was a little rocky due to the looming pandemic. With the exclusitivity over and the ports coming, a nice DLC upgrade is a nice way of showing they want this to be a big deal. It's a cool way of getting everybody excited for the second launch a lot smoother this time around.

That said. I would love all hands on deck to just focus on making the second part live up to the first. Not quickly but effectively. Cyberpunk 2077 showed us what happens when you dont have good management and push it out the door.
    >That said. I would love all hands on deck to just focus on making the second part live up to the first. Not quickly but effectively. Cyberpunk 2077 showed us what happens when you dont have good management and push it out the door.

Don't worry. They are only foccusing on Part 2 right now(no more DLCs). And I read some previous interviews that are pretty reassuring. For example, one of them told they want the second part to feel as big/epic and awe-inspiring as the first one(they said that they want people to feel in Part 2, the same way they felt in Part 1, when looking up at the plates above the slums). And in another interview about Part 2, one of them said that adapting the OG into a modern game, is huge work, because of all the new scenes they have to add in between the events of the OG, to give it a better pacing.

So it looks like they're giving their all.
Great news
Probably for the best. By the time all the parts are done, this is going to be one EXPENSIVE experience.
    And absolutely worth it.
It's good that they made this announcement. I took the DLC to be a sign that they were at least developing the movesets of the new characters and perhaps even adding in an additional feature that allows us to synergize ally attacks. The statement seems to suggest that SE is aware that all the announcements of the mobile games (though most likely headed by another development team that specializes in mobile games) and the DLC made it look like SE was distracted.

At this point at least, I'm hopeful that they are making progress... and that cross-generation development and whatever development issues that they have experienced should no longer be a huge concern. Bonus that we get a free PS5 upgrade if we bought the base game on PS4, now if I can get a hold of a PS5, lol.
This is good to hear! Originally felt like with Retrograde, we would keep getting DLC like additions that slow down the main story’s release. With that “priority” I can see less than 10 years now, unless the series goes over 3 installments...
Bruh if they made a DLC full game w Yuffie and then another one as the Turks or whoever the fuck else ill buy all the shits tbh lol.
I was upset that the DLC won't come in ps4.. but if they focus on the main story I may buy a ps5 it would be worth it
It doesn't surprise me how much priority is shifted towards 7, the amount of money they've made already is madness if you try and guess
Does anybody know of any word about a PC release anytime soon?
This is the one game where SE had full access to my wallet but they aren't taking my money, lol.
I feel like the introduction of Yuffie is all the DLC we need
Except for ya know, the mobile gacha and battle royal games.
    probably not the same division working on those
        If the battle royale team was working on Part 2 I'd be worried.
        Definitely not. While I appreciate that Square listened to the side of fans who wanted a more legitimate *remake* more in line with the original presentation, the split up of the stories as well as the gross gacha element is pretty disgusting. Far removed from the team making the remake.
            While I hate gacha mobile games, they’re absolutely huge in Japan, so to a certain extent, I can’t really blame SE for catering at least something to those gamers.
    Being made by completely different teams with zero relevance to the Remake...
        Do we have any confirmation of that?  I'm genuinely asking.  Genshin Impact made a billion dollars. . .so far.  Its a different world now.  I hope you're right but honestly it wouldn't surprise me if they dropped literally everything and scrambled to mobile gacha up their most popular franchise.
            > Creative Business Unit I is led by Yoshinori Kitase who was the head of Business Division 1 and focuses on Final Fantasy single player titles, spin-offs, and Kingdom Hearts games. The department comprises the former Business Division 1 (Mainline single player Final Fantasy series), Business Division 3 (Kingdom Hearts, Final Fantasy spin-offs, The World Ends with You, SaGa series), and Business Division 4 (Final Fantasy spin-offs produced with external companies, e.g., Dissidia Final Fantasy NT, Theatrhythm Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy Record Keeper).

> Creative Business Unit IV is led by Hirokazu Nishikado and focuses on the Mana series, along with remasters, ports, and mobile games.

You have it here. Regardless on how they define Ever Crisis/First Soldier,(either a mobile game of a spin-off) they're both separated from the main team.

Even if they're in the same Creative Division and Share Kitase as a lead, it's still 2 completely different teams. The former BD1 is working on the remake while the former BD4 is working on the mobile games. With Mobius FF shutting down a while ago, they had openings for new projects
Sigh, getting a PS5 is still very hard in the Philippines, I wish they release the intergrade and the sequel in PS4.
Darn that means they won't give us the scrapped Tifa chapter
    Scrapped Tifa Chapter?
        They were supposedly(don't recall the source, just people talking about it) going to have a chapter on Tifa's activities post reactor 5 until Corneo.
            Based on the Yuffie trailer, it seems like we will be seeing at least some of that content.
Good?
Okay, but like, after Part 2 though
All I hope is the second part brings over all your content from the first game.

Like old school final fantasy you are just changing disk's
    X for doubt.......................... If you played the game yourself and know what kind of gear you get in the hardmode, you know it's impossible to bring that over cause it would break part 2 completely from the start (>!the acc from the optional super boss that gives a full limit break bar at the start of every fight!<)
Yes please, more fan service at the cost of story cohesion.

Are there any indicators in the original story that yuffie would have been in midgar during the events of the game?
    I mean, in the original you can >!find her outside Junon...which is kind of close to midgar?!<
    > Are there any indicators in the original story that yuffie would have been in midgar during the events of the game?

Nope. It's not impossible, I suppose, since we don't know specifically what Yuffie was up to before we recruit her (besides that she's on a materia-stealing quest) but there's definitely never any suggestion that she was in Midgar.
    Nothing about the Yuffie episode seems to hurt cohesion with the story of remake.  


It also doesn't seem to contradict anything in OG but that's not really important.
Honestly, idgaf about intergrade because of PS5 availability. Just get the sequel done and quit fuckin' around beating a dead horse. Not that it's dead or anything, but...
    Part 2 is going to be next gen anyway.
        Yeah but if they'd have focused their resources it would be released sooner (hopefully by the time I can get a console!). I remember when FF7r dropped and they said they weren't going to do DLC or anything, just moving on to part 2
            It's better they cut their PS5 developing teeth on this than part 2.
Yeah too bad the DLC they released is PS5 EXCLUSIVE. When the base game was released on PS4.

Fucking bull.
    I understand your frustration but they just can't make a cutting edge game like they want to when dealing with obsolete hardware. They did what they could with FF7 R part 1 and many people complained it looked wack. It's for the best.
        [deleted]
            Base PS4 is at the end of its lifetime, came out 2014 its been 8 years. Obviously PC isn't, nobody said so. Do you want to wait double the time for them to develop the game for Ps4/Ps5 and even then would you be happy playing a much inferior graphical version that people will make fun of how bad it looks?
                [deleted]
                    Saying obsolete was probably an exaggeration, I agree. However it does seem like Squenix wants to always deliver the best ground breaking graphics with every installment and they just can't anymore on the PS4. They also may have signed a deal with Sony to help them boost PS5 sales... but that's another story. One thing for sure is that games developed specifically for one system tend to look and feel immensely better than the multiplat ones which also require a lot more manpower to port to the other platforms.
                    >who puts graphics as secondary to gameplay and story

But the gameplay was also negatively affected by being on last gen hardware.
                        [deleted]
                            The world design was most limited by last gen hardware, along with forcing characters through small cracks constantly to hide loading screens.
                                Yeah this - The major difference between PS4/PS5 is the PS5s ability to just load stuff at speed. PS4 has been around for a longtime now, and when you make a game on the 4 you have to assume your player is going to be using the original unit, not the pro. So you have to build your game around those specs. When you exlude your game to the PS5 it can change how you structure the entire experience because you don't have to worry nearly so much about loading things in.
        And they should have made the DLC available on PS4 and continued the remake on PS5. Or not released the base game at all on PS4. 

Ya'll can downvote me all you want, I will fucking die on this hill.
            Not much valid reasons to demand that it should be on PS4 based on the reviews the game got in the PS4. To solve this, they went after PS5 and used the faster platform to add more features and the DLC for a better experience.

And yeah, I think you will fucking die of your PS5 thirst because don't act like it is THAT essential and it is Part 2. You will get a PS5 before Part 2 unless you don't actually buy it.
    As much as I'm annoyed about it too, gonna hafta upgrade for the sake of the second part anyways.
        Yeah, if you can fucking get a ps5.
    Boo hoo
I thought SE stated that there was gonna be three installments? Oh well, I'm not complaining, only surprised.
    they never definitively said that, but also what exactly are you surprised about here?
        Yeah I guess you're right. They said "multiple parts". But, I'm surprised they are only planning to do one additional one and that's all. Wasn't there talk of remaking crisis core, etc.
            ever crisis encompasses the crisis core remake.

also, the language that is used doesn't mean only one sequel.
                Ahh okay awesome. Thanks!
    They're saying there'll only be one DLC for Part 1, this isn't about Part 2 or what comes later.
        Oh okay gotcha
i am surprised that there will be new summons in a DLC ! will those carry over to ff7r2 you think?
    I think their plan was to continue the same save file throughout? Maybe I’m wrong, but I thought that was the case
        Balancing that would be insane.
Thank god.
Yaaaasss thank you. Can’t wait to see my Gold Saucer!
Will it ever drop on Xbox?
This and they're likely wanting to stuff the game and content into one package when sold for PC & Xbox.
Well, not until the entire game is done is what it seems like. So there could potentially be some way later down the line. But that's just my speculation
I think the DLC was most likely needed because if part 2 goes past the section of story where yuffie is normally found in the original game then it's a great way to introduce her before that part, maybe at the end of the DLC she ends up at that section of the game waiting for the team
Hopefully by the time they are finished I will have found a ps5
    You will be looking for a PS6
Good.
I was under the impression that subsequent episodes are the DCLs.
[deleted]
    The game is complete.
Thank god
Sequel? So there will be a Final Fantasy VIII Remake?
    No final fantasy 7 remake part 2
        What? Do people have to pay for part 2?
            Yes part two will be a full and complete game much like part 1.
                So you are basically paying 120 dollars for a 60 dollars game?
                    Why do you say it’s a 60 dollar game?
                        Why do we have to pay for part 2?
                            The same reason you have to play for uncharted part 2, Uncharted 4 and the new god of war.

The remake is the first game in  a series, each part is a fully complete game.
                            It will be a full release much like the recent remake. The original game is being remade as a trilogy.
                                So they are dividing up 1 game into 3 games for 60 dollars each? Are you saying that they are basically selling a 60 dollar game for 180 dollars? The original version is like 15 dollars on Steam right now...
                                    Video game development has changed a lot since the days of the original. There have been many advancements which have improved the gaming experience is areas such as graphics, animations, gameplay and much more. Compare the number of polygons, textures, detail and roughly hours long it would take to create cloud for the current gen vs the original. These differences apply to all aspects of game development. 

If you want extra clarification on anything I’ve mentioned please feel free to ask.
                                    Feel free to play the original instead then. But just so you know the original ff7 was not $15 when it first came out more than 20 years ago.
                                    Yes... that's the same thing Blizzard did with Starcraft 2. The Terran, Zerg, & Protoss campaigns were all separate releases $60 each.
I'll be honest; I'm still wondering what -- if *anything* -- will carry over into "Part 2". It felt super bizarre to me that each character only got 6 weapons, when there's a clear space in the UI for a 7th weapon. I had hoped, if Part 1 got DLC, it would've added new weapons for the crew. With this being Yuffie's DLC adventure, I imagine that's not going to happen.

Now, I imagine the adventure will end with Yuffie stealing everyone's materia (or maybe Part 2 will *begin* with that), just to justify not having us start off in god-mode. also, with the max level being 50, I can't imagine levels carrying over, either. And a couple of accessories were also pretty OP.

So... will *anything* carry forward?

I would honestly be kind of bummed if *nothing* did, but at the same time, just looking at the situation, I can't imagine what *would*.

That would be awesome.

If they want to reset everyone's levels, the story can just say something "funky" happened in that weird pocket universe where you fought Sephiroth and everyone is back down to normal instead of ultra-badass lol
        If we don't get levels carried over why do the characters keep getting exp then? I hope they explain that if this unfolds.
What’s the over/under on FFVII Remake making it’s way to Xbox? I was expecting this in yesterday’s show and was surprised it wasn’t announced. I know it was a one year exclusive and that should be over in April.

I have the game on PS4, just prefer to play on Xbox (not to mention I have a Series X and NOT a PS5...yet).
I just don’t like that the dlc is PS5 exclusive since it’s such a new system. Even DMC5 had the Virgil DLC on both
From what I gather: 

FF7R:Intergrade was meant to be the PS5 release attached with a Yuffie story for incentive to re-purchase the game for PS5.

This has likely been the plan for a long while (likely before Covid happened) 

So, when Covid hit, and PS5 console shortage happened, scalping got really bad, and they probably reworked this plan. 

Making the PS5 upgrade free, and Yuffie story as a DLC?
I kinda wish that the DLC they went for would be Tifa coming to Midgar with Zangan and then telling her story from there.
I’m surprised they did this at all. I would have thought it was full speed ahead for part 2 like surely could have introduced her there
Usually dev teams split after a big release, with part of the team making DLC using assets from the original game, while the rest of the team sets up the groundwork for the sequel. So they're not unnecessary either.
I want a mode where you play the original story as a remake and then the new spin is new game+
    This would amazing. Two games in one essentially lol
Didnt they get content cancelled they promised?  or did they actually deliver?  Was bout to start playing that yesterday actually lol.  But ADD too powerful ._.
    Yeah FFXV had a ton of content cut out of the main game with the promise of a ton of dlc, that also got cut in half.
    There were 3 dlc cancelled with one being turned into a light novel, due to the director leaving Square Enix pretty abruptly. It wasn't originally planned for the game, as it was a second season pass announced pretty far out after the game released. The original planned season pass along with a myriad of patches, free content, and the Royal expansion was still added to the game over the first couple years. So the extra content that got cancelled was just DLC conceptualised far after release in the first place, not so much stuff that they promised from before launch or anything vital to the game
        Thought he left becauuuuuuuuuse they were cancelled? O_O
            Wouldn't hold my breath for a definitive answer from Square Enix about that situation, they are a japanese company, and Tabata probably signed a non disclosure agreement upon leaving.

We will never know if Square decided to cancel the second season pass and Tabata felt that was unacceptable because it was promised to fans already after so many issues, or if it was the other way around, Tabata deciding to just leave which made Square cancel the remaining DLCs.

Personally I feel the first one is more plausible since most content post Ignis was made without Tabata as a director anyway, they could have clearly worked without him, I mean the project continued without Nomura in the first place anyway.
                Yeah I think it's the first as they are probably trying to make us believe something to be true even it isn't to prevent backlash and Tabata can't say a word because non disclosure agreement. Necessary evil those non disclosure agreements are.
                    Doesnt he still work under square just running the luminous engine Studios that square owns? I wouldnt expect there to have been some big fallout where he had to sign a NDA since technically he is still employed through SE
                        He left both Square and Luminous Productions, Square was aparently impressed with his performance with FFXV, he took a project on the verge of being cancelled, rebooted it, released it in only 3 years of development with the new engine and came out with a success (despite it's flaws of course). So around the time of release of Episode Prompto or Episode Ignis, Square created Luminous Productions and made him the leading guy of that team. Really nice position, which makes his departure so strange. He left at the time of the new wave of DLCs being cancelled for unconfirmed reasons.
                            Why do you think those reasons are unconfirmed though? My mom always said if you had nothing good to say don't say anything at all.
                                Just how big companies handle things, they don't usually talk about why someone left or was let go, despite all the brand damage Don Mattrick did to Xbox he was still simply "transfered" to Zynga, not fired. The original director for version 1.0 of FFXIV wasn't fired either, he was simply moved to a different position.

There are so many possible reasons for him leaving and so little to go from. Maybe there was drama, maybe there was none at all and it was simply Tabata wanting to pursue a different career path. Maybe they wanted to cancel the DLCs  for a while, and Tabata leaving was the perfect excuse. Who knows.
                        You always signed a Non Disclosure agreement with a company when making something like a video game. Keeps you from leaking the game out or telling too much about it that won't be in the game. I really don't think Square Enix didn't want to put anymore funds in the game.
                            Yea I agree. Even though I love the game, I think SE and the majority of the fan base was ready to move on. Cant wait to see what they have in store for Forspoken. Wish they would have just kept the name Project Athia. Sounds better to me
                                I mean some fans actually thought they were going to "finish" the game though even if it had a very unrealistic amount of work. Some fans thought of it as a promise with unrealistic expectations. How about not having a game go into development hell? You could say that "Well they needed all hands on deck to fix FF14!" which again is also Square Enix's in a way. Why should other projects suffer because someone else messed up? I just think it's wrong.
        yeah when they announced season 2 i was really surprised because I thought all was said and done for the game at that point.
I couldn't agree more. The main game itself could've been so much better if they hadn't broken the idea of it into an anime and other stuff. I wish they had just found a way to combine it all together.
Nono, you're good, they don't release unfinished messes and patch in relevant story parts later behind paywalls... Hajime tabata left a few years ago

*airhorn soundeffect*

*runs away*
    To be fair it wasn't all Tabata's fault. He was getting an average of 2 hours of sleep and upper management was not nice to him. (That's what I've heard anyways)

But you have a point that this isn't the same team in any way. Yet it is still a concern for many. Fans were burned badly so some will be worried naturally.
        Heheh it was more of a silly joke on my part, plus it always surprised me how nomura gets so much shit for his style, yet every game he's credited on are wild successes, while excuses were being made (and rightly so, I just felt the same should be extended nomura, which it rarely is) for tabata who's credits are generally among the least popular games
            To be fair considering FFXV's development hell, Tabata only got put in the position he did because Nomura kept changing things up, which delayed KH3, XV, *and* 7r. He had to make due with what he had.

Going by KH3's re:Mind DLC ending, Nomura is still very salty over being removed from XV.
                Ngl, I lost interest in KH3 halfway between games, I dunno how cause I used to love the series, but I own it, just can't bring myself to finish it, so I haven't seen re:mind.

But having gorged on all available info on 15 and the dev history of it, I can definitely understand why he is salty. I know its never ever going to happen, but I would've loved a XV Nomura cut heheh.

And yeah, Tabata definitely had an uphill battle, and it's understandable why the game shipped in the state it did, HOWEVER, if I worked on a script, outline, functioning engine that needed a lot of work for nearly a decade, and our bosses takes that from me and gives it to you telling you you have 1 year to finish it, would your solution be to scrap a decade of work, and just start over?

Point is, Tabata didn't have nearly enough time, but he kinda threw the baby out with the bathwater, it'd take way less time to untangle the mess 2 console generations had done with the engine and just finish it, than do it all on an unrealistic schedule.

Even annual games are only able to be annual because they switch up studios or reuse assets like crazy, they don't build an entire 50hr rpg with cutting edge tech from scratch
I have no issue paying for the DLC if the content is good.
    TBH I was planning on buying the PS5 version even if it came without DLC because I'm a simp for FF7, so this is great news. 

Hopefully this kind of approach from SE shows that they're being bold, pragmatic and innovative with FF7R rather than going a more cautious, traditional route - which would've been understandable given the OG's legacy.
        i mean dlc thats worth 2 chapters (est 2 hours) of content? which you can squeeze and grind out to more? i agree dlc gonna be dope
    I can already tell you now it's going to be good. But the chances are high that it's not going to be technically worth it considering how much it adds and price/playtime wise. Like I expect to be done with it 8 times faster and pay about 2/5 of the main game. DLC is in my eyes made to squeeze money from the fans, such as myself who cannot resist more content.
    No question. It's safe to say this will be.
        [deleted]
            Indeed. With Intergrade, FFXVI, Forspoken, Outriders and the continuation of the Remake, these next couple of years are going to be gold for Square. Are they "back"? Time will tell, but I am hopeful.
                FF14 has been amazing too since 2015 with all the expansions, a mile better than the base game.
                    FF14 is not just amazing - it’s honestly become one of my favorite entries in the entire franchise. It’s something special.

I feel like such a fool for thinking of it as “just another MMO” for years before I started playing.
                        I heard people say that for years and it kept me persisting with the game, I struggled through ARR and especially the inbetween quests before Heavensward. Then you get a flying mount and the writing dramatically improves and suddenly it's incredible. I wish they would cut out more of ARR so its easier to get into, like cut 50% more.
                            With a fairly recent patch, they did remove quite a bit of the “filler” from the base game and the epilogue leading into Heavensward! That content is still nowhere near as excellent as everything which follows it, but it’s definitely more streamlined now. 

Like you said though, Heavensward is when the game really began to hit its stride. The storytelling from that point on is not just the best I’ve seen in an MMO, it’s some of the best I’ve seen in an RPG, period.
                    Yes. That's why I'm honestly not at all worried about XVI not being quality. I think at the very *least* it will be good.
                        I just hope the combat takes influence from 7R.
                            We’ll see. As a DmC vet tho, watching that trailer gave me some hardcore DMC/Bayonetta vibes. I’m hoping they take the DMC5 route and have multiple playable characters all who feel different from eachother
                            It might. Although with the combat director being of DMC fame, it might lean more towards that. A hybrid of the two isn't out of the question.
                                It just has to have a playable party and strategy in combat. I assume SE realise that after the reception to 7R, but I'm a little nervous.
                Nier Automata, DQXI, KH3+Remind and FFVIIR. For me they came back.
                    Yeah, fair enough. They did a great job with the re-release of DQXI. They added *a lot* to it. Hopefully it continues and there's another Golden Age ahead for them here.
                Don't forget!!! Dragon Quest XII is also in development currently so expect that within the next year or two, honestly can't wait!
                    That soon? Nice! DQXI was my first game of the series and I really enjoyed it. I loved the locations and it just had a lot of charm to it. At the time I was really in the mood for a turn based RPG and this game really scratched that itch.

                    Same. Some of my best early gaming memories were courtesy of Squaresoft.
                It’s certainly improvement from PS3 era.
                    Yeah, that was rock bottom for them, even though I thought the XIII games were alright, but definitely not the quality we had been used to.
                And the Nier remaster/remake! AAAAAAaaaaaa 24 days left
                    Yes! So other than the protagonist being the brother and not the father, are there any other changes in Replicant? Do thinks play out exactly the same otherwise?
                        It should. Combat is remade from the ground up and the soundtrack and voice acting are redone but story and locations should be mostly the same. I do hope that the word system is changed but we'll have to see.
                            OK. Yeah, I'm really looking forward to going back in. It's been such a long time since I played the original Nier and it was a unique experience. I'm really glad Square is bringing Replicant over.
    Exactly. You'll never hear me complain about paying for Hearts of Stone or Blood and Wine. They were worth every penny, and everything that DLC should aspire to be. If Integrade comes even close to living up to either of those I am 100% thrilled. I mean hell, Blood and Wine was my GotY as an expansion, lol.
    And not just good.. a genuine supplement to the game, rather than part of the game that should have been there without the extra charge.  I paid for the DLC for Horizon: Zero Dawn and was satisfied, but I don't feel the same way about Yuffie because she was in the original game, sidequest or not.  I'm glad they're not taking that further.
    You will if it delays part 2 for 3 more years
        They have said they’re going to focus on part 2 rather than DLC.
    New and Good and correctly adds to story
They haven’t had a single miss on the remake stuff yet honestly. The core game was awesome, the PS5 upgrade is amazing, and the Yuffie DLC seems like it will be juuuuust enough and lets us get familiar with a new character’s mechanics before they join in P2.
    Plus a proper Super Boss in the form of Weiss for pure fan-service and giving us that kind of KH Final Mix type of challenge where we can test our skills against secret bosses that hint at the next game and story beats, etc. I always loved the Final Mixes so having a sort of FF VII Final Mix in between each game is honestly perfect.
        Yo I did not even think of the final mix parallel with secret super bosses. Let Weiss be as challenging as Lingering Will was the first time I tried it. Please SE...
        >I always loved the Final Mixes so having a sort of FF VII Final Mix in between each game is honestly perfect.

But that won't happen anymore. He just told us this. 😐
            Uhhhh...no...no he didn't. He just said there will be no more DLC after Intergrade and they're focusing on Part 2. And then I 100% guarantee that after Part 2, it will also have another in-between version similar to Intergrade which will be its "Final Mix." 

Intergrade is already a Final Mix, it has new story beats, cutscenes, some enhancements here and there, fixes, new areas and new Post-Game content (like secret bosses, hence why they added Weiss into it.) 

It's exactly the same thing, it's from the same director. I always assumed he would do this between games because it keeps people a bit satiated until the next game. He hasn't ruled out doing this for every single part at all, all he stated was that they are now focusing on Part 2 and Intergrade is the only DLC coming for Part 1...which makes complete and total sense.
                Wrong.

Nomura: "The roadwork we have laid out to complete the entire story takes priority, and if we are to ever add DLC, it will not be until after everything has been done."

The entire story. Not just a portion of the story(Part 2), but the entire thing.
                    You read into it waaaayyyy too much but feel free to remind me in a couple years when I'm inevitably right and we get a Part 2 equivalent of Intergrade.
    Yeah, actually, in my initial post, I didn't even mention the great job they've already done with the first part. 😆 But, yeah, it'll be nice to get some "hold over" content. I'm even including Ever Crisis in that which could be really good. Battle royal games like First Soldier aren't really my cup of tea, but I hope it does alright.
I'm pretty sure you still have to pay for the Yuffie DLC. Only the PS5 upgrade is free.
    Yes, I said that. 😏
        Oh, yes, you did!
    Do you really? I thought it was included with the PS5 upgrade for free
        If you upgrade from a ps4 version it's not included
            Everything I had read said only the free ps plus version wasn’t free? I can’t find anything clarifying it either way so now I’m confused
            You’re right, just found an article that specified that
Except they didn't handle it well, because all the people who bought the game can't buy the DLC due to it being on PS5. I'm still pissed off about that.
    Understandable. This was basically Square ripping off the bandaid and saying that the rest of the parts are not going to be on PS4. That is not surprising since the old hardware held back the first game (it's still a good looking game, though). But, people have the right to be upset as the PS4 is a large user base to ignore. With the PS5 launch being what it is, hopefully in another year or so PS5s will be more readily available. I mean, I get they wanted to use this to show off experiment with PS5 features, but it is odd to just not release a PS4 version as well. This could've been partly a SONY decision to help move more PS5 units.
    considering the PS4 version had awful load time and egregious texture disparities that were actually a bug they couldn't fix, why would you expect them to release DLC with the same problems due to the console it's on?
        Well they released the actual game on PS4 so obviously that stuff didn't matter to them, right?
            It was a sacrifice due to technical limitation that 100% bothered them lol. It’s like feeling ok about showing up to work in sweat pants just because you’re also wearing a dress shirt and tie... why limit themselves with the problems of last gen when they can solve the issues and get people to buy the console they will need for the next game in the series?
>Obviously DLC content like Yuffie you expect to have to pay for.

No, Yuffie was part of the original game, with no extra charge.  I only expect to pay more now because that's where companies are heading more and more, and it's infuriating.
    She was in the original game, but really wasn't a major character. She will be now and she's getting more exposition, and we'll see how her actions in Midgar had an affect on the story for the first part that we didn't see. I think the fact they're taking the time to make a minor character in the original and actually have her have a bigger impact in the story is worth it. We'll probably get something similar for the next part, perhaps with Vincent.
    The OG was a single 40-80 hour game. The Remake series is not the same amount of content, not even close, drawing equivalence like that is silly.
    Well, yes, but she was extra content and completely missable. The end FMV doesn't have her for that reason. If VII was made today, she would be a dlc character through and through.

Same with Vincent. You can cut both out and not lose out on the VII experience. 

Yuffie is one of my favorites so I'm glad she got her own DLC and she's in the game, but she isn't a core part of the original.
Why would content for Yuffie *obviously* be a paid DLC?  They’re taking creative liberties with this new remake so why would her remake story cost more than the base $180 we are already going to be paying?  Shiittt, they should be throwing extra content at ya for that price lol.  I’m a FF7 simp and a half but paid DLC is a ridiculous notion for what amounts to a $180 story.
    "ridiculous notion"? you want a product, you have to pay for it. they have to pay the people that put in the time to make this product. they do not owe you anything just because you paid them $60 a year ago.
        ....And that’s your opinion.
    It could be worse, it could be the FFXV model. Yeah, they're going to milk you with this. I think everyone saw this coming. If you have the PS4 version, you're getting the upgrade for free and paying a bit extra for a few more hours of story. I really don't think it's that big of a deal. This is all they're doing. They are working hard on the next part.
If I had FF7R downloaded on my PS4, then set it aside and have a PS5 now, how will I be able to download the upgraded game and/or DLC on the PS5? My account will be recognized as purchasing the PS4 version and just download automatically once I go to the download page and select download PS5 version?

Also then you have a game that doesn't have my save files etc on a PS5 now? I have to replay the game on PS5 just to access DLC?
    So, you don't have the PS4 installed now? If not, redownload it, then it'll upgrade when the update is released. The only version of the game that's not eligible for the upgrade is the free one that was made available through PS recently.

If you don't have a save anywhere then you're going to have to start over. The PS4 saves will work for the PS5 version after the upgrade.
        Nope, we moved and I figured I had no need for the PS4 anymore so it's been in storage.

Thanks for the info -- 

1) re-download on PS5 through my existing account/prior PS4 purchase. (will have my saves)  
2) Game will auto update when PS5 update comes and I can buy DLC.

Is this accurate?
            Yes.
                Great, thanks for the help.
This and also the DLC will he a testing ground for features on ps5 going forward.
    It's a good way to figure out fixes to the original and allows them to play with some new ideas for the next part. I noticed there seem to be team-up moves that were not present in the base game. Probably seeing what might work so the next game will rock.
It's very very normal for developers to have part of the main team make DLC between installments, there's no reason to think this wasn't planned.
    Well typically game companies dont outright lie, only on rare occasions. They stated there would be no DLC before part 1 dropped, yet here we are. 

Technically you cant buy it separately so I guess it's not actually DLC but added content to the ps5 version
        Huh I never saw that statement, any idea how to find it? I'm very surprised I missed it.
> I think the Intergrade also wasn't planned as DLC...

Hmmm... I don't know for sure, of course, but I am thinking they plan to do DLC for both Yuffie and Vincent. That way they can flesh out their related stories on the side without affecting the A plot of FF7R.

Neither of them are integral to the A plot and they could have them join up with the main party during the final part of FF7R, likely without the DLC being a necessity. 

Definitely some wishful thinking here on my part. (Please keep that Deepground shit far away from me lol.) I never cared for either characters in OGFF7 so I could skip the DLCs if they play it this way.

That's my hot take~

EDIT: Whelp, after the news today that theory/hope is busted. 😬
I think it was mentioned in a previous interview with Nomura that Intergrade will only be 2 chapters long, but I'm not sure if it was confirmed that the chapters would be the same length as in Remake. I'd assume a 2-5 hour run would be expected. Post-episode content not yet confirmed, though.
I'm gonna mark this as spoilers just in case but, >!we still have another optional character, Vincent, so I suspect we will continue receiving DLC at least for him in later parts!<
    To be fair >!I sort of doubt either Yuffie or Vincent will be optional this time around. There was a charm to older Final Fantasies that had optional/secret characters, but I imagine with how much work it is to implement fully voiced, playable characters and how much more complicated the storytelling is, especially if they continue to pull in spin-offs where Yuffie and Vincent weren't optional, then there's no logical way they can be optional secret characters in Remake.!<

If there's more DLC, though, it could be a great way to start working with characters we probably won't see for awhile. >!I don't know how they'd do it, but it could be a way to raise hype about Cid, or Vincent, or even Cait Sith if we're not going to see them for awhile.!< Could also be fun to have DLC that explores some of the backstories of the characters we already have. I would've thought it'd be cool to have a Red XIII DLC that goes into his >!pre-Midgar solo adventure and ends with him getting captured by Hojo.!<
        Fair points, and I don't think any character will be optional this time, but I wanted to point out that Bioware has def laid the groundwork for how to do awesome, fully realized party members with storylines who are optional.
            Oh, for sure. I personally love secret/optional characters. I remember playing Dragon Age Origins >!and my brother was shocked that I had Wynne in my party. He thought she was just some random old lady you were supposed to kill when you encountered her in the tower.!< I also miss the days of like, Final Fantasy VI when there were TONS of optional characters, I don't think I ever would've found some of them if not for a guide.
    There is no way that yuffie/vincent will be optional characters.
        I mean considering Yuffie is already DLC, its plausible
Yep, that was part of the motivation for them to start the Remake project in the first place. It was a "now or never" situation.

I forget who said this, but another famous game developer said something similar that us consumers never really consider. There are only so many games that a developer gets to work on in one lifetime. Working on even one project that you're not passionate about or one that fails to deliver can feel like years wasted. Even in a long 30 or 40-year career, that has to be extremely painful. It's definitely given me greater appreciation for the good things that games do so that I focus less on the things that I dislike or think are lacking. Sometimes I feel like some gamers focus way too much on the negative and end up disregarding the positives.
I disagree that this is going to show what a PS5 is capable of considering they are using a PS4 game for the DLC. 

I do agree however that they can test some ideas out. For example Yuffie. Incase there are issue with the character's gameplay they can make it better for the main game. 

Also maybe they can tweak current systems or test new ones.
    Yea exactly, the first games on a new system never come close to the ones at the end of its life (I'm sure there are exceptions) put breath of fire 3 against FFIX on ps1 for example, obviously things have come a long way but if square enix can get a foot in the door from this DLC to work out some kinks, it's worth it.
        > ...this is an excellent way to test what they can pull out of the bag on ps5.

I thought you were saying the dlc was gonna show off what the PS5 is capable of with this comment. My bad if I misrepresented your opinion. 

My expectations for the DLC is that the most "power" we are going to get from the PS5 is the resolution and fps upgrades already stated.
isn’t it currently free on psn plus?
    the ps plus version won't get the upgrade to the ps5 version. this and ps plus requires an ongoing subscription.
        well that sucks!
>That said. I would love all hands on deck to just focus on making the second part live up to the first. Not quickly but effectively. Cyberpunk 2077 showed us what happens when you dont have good management and push it out the door.

Don't worry. They are only foccusing on Part 2 right now(no more DLCs). And I read some previous interviews that are pretty reassuring. For example, one of them told they want the second part to feel as big/epic and awe-inspiring as the first one(they said that they want people to feel in Part 2, the same way they felt in Part 1, when looking up at the plates above the slums). And in another interview about Part 2, one of them said that adapting the OG into a modern game, is huge work, because of all the new scenes they have to add in between the events of the OG, to give it a better pacing.

So it looks like they're giving their all.
And absolutely worth it.
probably not the same division working on those
    If the battle royale team was working on Part 2 I'd be worried.
    Definitely not. While I appreciate that Square listened to the side of fans who wanted a more legitimate *remake* more in line with the original presentation, the split up of the stories as well as the gross gacha element is pretty disgusting. Far removed from the team making the remake.
        While I hate gacha mobile games, they’re absolutely huge in Japan, so to a certain extent, I can’t really blame SE for catering at least something to those gamers.
Being made by completely different teams with zero relevance to the Remake...
    Do we have any confirmation of that?  I'm genuinely asking.  Genshin Impact made a billion dollars. . .so far.  Its a different world now.  I hope you're right but honestly it wouldn't surprise me if they dropped literally everything and scrambled to mobile gacha up their most popular franchise.
        > Creative Business Unit I is led by Yoshinori Kitase who was the head of Business Division 1 and focuses on Final Fantasy single player titles, spin-offs, and Kingdom Hearts games. The department comprises the former Business Division 1 (Mainline single player Final Fantasy series), Business Division 3 (Kingdom Hearts, Final Fantasy spin-offs, The World Ends with You, SaGa series), and Business Division 4 (Final Fantasy spin-offs produced with external companies, e.g., Dissidia Final Fantasy NT, Theatrhythm Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy Record Keeper).

> Creative Business Unit IV is led by Hirokazu Nishikado and focuses on the Mana series, along with remasters, ports, and mobile games.

You have it here. Regardless on how they define Ever Crisis/First Soldier,(either a mobile game of a spin-off) they're both separated from the main team.

Even if they're in the same Creative Division and Share Kitase as a lead, it's still 2 completely different teams. The former BD1 is working on the remake while the former BD4 is working on the mobile games. With Mobius FF shutting down a while ago, they had openings for new projects
Scrapped Tifa Chapter?
    They were supposedly(don't recall the source, just people talking about it) going to have a chapter on Tifa's activities post reactor 5 until Corneo.
        Based on the Yuffie trailer, it seems like we will be seeing at least some of that content.
X for doubt.......................... If you played the game yourself and know what kind of gear you get in the hardmode, you know it's impossible to bring that over cause it would break part 2 completely from the start (>!the acc from the optional super boss that gives a full limit break bar at the start of every fight!<)
I mean, in the original you can >!find her outside Junon...which is kind of close to midgar?!<
> Are there any indicators in the original story that yuffie would have been in midgar during the events of the game?

Nope. It's not impossible, I suppose, since we don't know specifically what Yuffie was up to before we recruit her (besides that she's on a materia-stealing quest) but there's definitely never any suggestion that she was in Midgar.
Nothing about the Yuffie episode seems to hurt cohesion with the story of remake.  


It also doesn't seem to contradict anything in OG but that's not really important.
Part 2 is going to be next gen anyway.
    Yeah but if they'd have focused their resources it would be released sooner (hopefully by the time I can get a console!). I remember when FF7r dropped and they said they weren't going to do DLC or anything, just moving on to part 2
        It's better they cut their PS5 developing teeth on this than part 2.
I understand your frustration but they just can't make a cutting edge game like they want to when dealing with obsolete hardware. They did what they could with FF7 R part 1 and many people complained it looked wack. It's for the best.
    [deleted]
        Base PS4 is at the end of its lifetime, came out 2014 its been 8 years. Obviously PC isn't, nobody said so. Do you want to wait double the time for them to develop the game for Ps4/Ps5 and even then would you be happy playing a much inferior graphical version that people will make fun of how bad it looks?
            [deleted]
                Saying obsolete was probably an exaggeration, I agree. However it does seem like Squenix wants to always deliver the best ground breaking graphics with every installment and they just can't anymore on the PS4. They also may have signed a deal with Sony to help them boost PS5 sales... but that's another story. One thing for sure is that games developed specifically for one system tend to look and feel immensely better than the multiplat ones which also require a lot more manpower to port to the other platforms.
                >who puts graphics as secondary to gameplay and story

But the gameplay was also negatively affected by being on last gen hardware.
                    [deleted]
                        The world design was most limited by last gen hardware, along with forcing characters through small cracks constantly to hide loading screens.
                            Yeah this - The major difference between PS4/PS5 is the PS5s ability to just load stuff at speed. PS4 has been around for a longtime now, and when you make a game on the 4 you have to assume your player is going to be using the original unit, not the pro. So you have to build your game around those specs. When you exlude your game to the PS5 it can change how you structure the entire experience because you don't have to worry nearly so much about loading things in.
    And they should have made the DLC available on PS4 and continued the remake on PS5. Or not released the base game at all on PS4. 

Ya'll can downvote me all you want, I will fucking die on this hill.
        Not much valid reasons to demand that it should be on PS4 based on the reviews the game got in the PS4. To solve this, they went after PS5 and used the faster platform to add more features and the DLC for a better experience.

And yeah, I think you will fucking die of your PS5 thirst because don't act like it is THAT essential and it is Part 2. You will get a PS5 before Part 2 unless you don't actually buy it.
As much as I'm annoyed about it too, gonna hafta upgrade for the sake of the second part anyways.
    Yeah, if you can fucking get a ps5.
Boo hoo
they never definitively said that, but also what exactly are you surprised about here?
    Yeah I guess you're right. They said "multiple parts". But, I'm surprised they are only planning to do one additional one and that's all. Wasn't there talk of remaking crisis core, etc.
        ever crisis encompasses the crisis core remake.

also, the language that is used doesn't mean only one sequel.
            Ahh okay awesome. Thanks!
They're saying there'll only be one DLC for Part 1, this isn't about Part 2 or what comes later.
    Oh okay gotcha
I think their plan was to continue the same save file throughout? Maybe I’m wrong, but I thought that was the case
    Balancing that would be insane.
You will be looking for a PS6
The game is complete.
No final fantasy 7 remake part 2
    What? Do people have to pay for part 2?
        Yes part two will be a full and complete game much like part 1.
            So you are basically paying 120 dollars for a 60 dollars game?
                Why do you say it’s a 60 dollar game?
                    Why do we have to pay for part 2?
                        The same reason you have to play for uncharted part 2, Uncharted 4 and the new god of war.

The remake is the first game in  a series, each part is a fully complete game.
                        It will be a full release much like the recent remake. The original game is being remade as a trilogy.
                            So they are dividing up 1 game into 3 games for 60 dollars each? Are you saying that they are basically selling a 60 dollar game for 180 dollars? The original version is like 15 dollars on Steam right now...
                                Video game development has changed a lot since the days of the original. There have been many advancements which have improved the gaming experience is areas such as graphics, animations, gameplay and much more. Compare the number of polygons, textures, detail and roughly hours long it would take to create cloud for the current gen vs the original. These differences apply to all aspects of game development. 

If you want extra clarification on anything I’ve mentioned please feel free to ask.
                                Feel free to play the original instead then. But just so you know the original ff7 was not $15 when it first came out more than 20 years ago.
                                Yes... that's the same thing Blizzard did with Starcraft 2. The Terran, Zerg, & Protoss campaigns were all separate releases $60 each.
> Now, I imagine the adventure will end with Yuffie stealing everyone's materia (or maybe Part 2 will begin with that), just to justify not having us start off in god-mode. also, with the max level being 50, I can't imagine levels carrying over, either. And a couple of accessories were also pretty OP.

That would be awesome.

If they want to reset everyone's levels, the story can just say something "funky" happened in that weird pocket universe where you fought Sephiroth and everyone is back down to normal instead of ultra-badass lol
    If we don't get levels carried over why do the characters keep getting exp then? I hope they explain that if this unfolds.
This would amazing. Two games in one essentially lol
Yeah FFXV had a ton of content cut out of the main game with the promise of a ton of dlc, that also got cut in half.
There were 3 dlc cancelled with one being turned into a light novel, due to the director leaving Square Enix pretty abruptly. It wasn't originally planned for the game, as it was a second season pass announced pretty far out after the game released. The original planned season pass along with a myriad of patches, free content, and the Royal expansion was still added to the game over the first couple years. So the extra content that got cancelled was just DLC conceptualised far after release in the first place, not so much stuff that they promised from before launch or anything vital to the game
    Thought he left becauuuuuuuuuse they were cancelled? O_O
        Wouldn't hold my breath for a definitive answer from Square Enix about that situation, they are a japanese company, and Tabata probably signed a non disclosure agreement upon leaving.

We will never know if Square decided to cancel the second season pass and Tabata felt that was unacceptable because it was promised to fans already after so many issues, or if it was the other way around, Tabata deciding to just leave which made Square cancel the remaining DLCs.

Personally I feel the first one is more plausible since most content post Ignis was made without Tabata as a director anyway, they could have clearly worked without him, I mean the project continued without Nomura in the first place anyway.
            Yeah I think it's the first as they are probably trying to make us believe something to be true even it isn't to prevent backlash and Tabata can't say a word because non disclosure agreement. Necessary evil those non disclosure agreements are.
                Doesnt he still work under square just running the luminous engine Studios that square owns? I wouldnt expect there to have been some big fallout where he had to sign a NDA since technically he is still employed through SE
                    He left both Square and Luminous Productions, Square was aparently impressed with his performance with FFXV, he took a project on the verge of being cancelled, rebooted it, released it in only 3 years of development with the new engine and came out with a success (despite it's flaws of course). So around the time of release of Episode Prompto or Episode Ignis, Square created Luminous Productions and made him the leading guy of that team. Really nice position, which makes his departure so strange. He left at the time of the new wave of DLCs being cancelled for unconfirmed reasons.
                        Why do you think those reasons are unconfirmed though? My mom always said if you had nothing good to say don't say anything at all.
                            Just how big companies handle things, they don't usually talk about why someone left or was let go, despite all the brand damage Don Mattrick did to Xbox he was still simply "transfered" to Zynga, not fired. The original director for version 1.0 of FFXIV wasn't fired either, he was simply moved to a different position.

There are so many possible reasons for him leaving and so little to go from. Maybe there was drama, maybe there was none at all and it was simply Tabata wanting to pursue a different career path. Maybe they wanted to cancel the DLCs  for a while, and Tabata leaving was the perfect excuse. Who knows.
                    You always signed a Non Disclosure agreement with a company when making something like a video game. Keeps you from leaking the game out or telling too much about it that won't be in the game. I really don't think Square Enix didn't want to put anymore funds in the game.
                        Yea I agree. Even though I love the game, I think SE and the majority of the fan base was ready to move on. Cant wait to see what they have in store for Forspoken. Wish they would have just kept the name Project Athia. Sounds better to me
                            I mean some fans actually thought they were going to "finish" the game though even if it had a very unrealistic amount of work. Some fans thought of it as a promise with unrealistic expectations. How about not having a game go into development hell? You could say that "Well they needed all hands on deck to fix FF14!" which again is also Square Enix's in a way. Why should other projects suffer because someone else messed up? I just think it's wrong.
    yeah when they announced season 2 i was really surprised because I thought all was said and done for the game at that point.
To be fair it wasn't all Tabata's fault. He was getting an average of 2 hours of sleep and upper management was not nice to him. (That's what I've heard anyways)

But you have a point that this isn't the same team in any way. Yet it is still a concern for many. Fans were burned badly so some will be worried naturally.
    Heheh it was more of a silly joke on my part, plus it always surprised me how nomura gets so much shit for his style, yet every game he's credited on are wild successes, while excuses were being made (and rightly so, I just felt the same should be extended nomura, which it rarely is) for tabata who's credits are generally among the least popular games
        To be fair considering FFXV's development hell, Tabata only got put in the position he did because Nomura kept changing things up, which delayed KH3, XV, *and* 7r. He had to make due with what he had.

Going by KH3's re:Mind DLC ending, Nomura is still very salty over being removed from XV.
            Ngl, I lost interest in KH3 halfway between games, I dunno how cause I used to love the series, but I own it, just can't bring myself to finish it, so I haven't seen re:mind.

But having gorged on all available info on 15 and the dev history of it, I can definitely understand why he is salty. I know its never ever going to happen, but I would've loved a XV Nomura cut heheh.

And yeah, Tabata definitely had an uphill battle, and it's understandable why the game shipped in the state it did, HOWEVER, if I worked on a script, outline, functioning engine that needed a lot of work for nearly a decade, and our bosses takes that from me and gives it to you telling you you have 1 year to finish it, would your solution be to scrap a decade of work, and just start over?

Point is, Tabata didn't have nearly enough time, but he kinda threw the baby out with the bathwater, it'd take way less time to untangle the mess 2 console generations had done with the engine and just finish it, than do it all on an unrealistic schedule.

Even annual games are only able to be annual because they switch up studios or reuse assets like crazy, they don't build an entire 50hr rpg with cutting edge tech from scratch
TBH I was planning on buying the PS5 version even if it came without DLC because I'm a simp for FF7, so this is great news. 

Hopefully this kind of approach from SE shows that they're being bold, pragmatic and innovative with FF7R rather than going a more cautious, traditional route - which would've been understandable given the OG's legacy.
    i mean dlc thats worth 2 chapters (est 2 hours) of content? which you can squeeze and grind out to more? i agree dlc gonna be dope
I can already tell you now it's going to be good. But the chances are high that it's not going to be technically worth it considering how much it adds and price/playtime wise. Like I expect to be done with it 8 times faster and pay about 2/5 of the main game. DLC is in my eyes made to squeeze money from the fans, such as myself who cannot resist more content.
No question. It's safe to say this will be.

        Indeed. With Intergrade, FFXVI, Forspoken, Outriders and the continuation of the Remake, these next couple of years are going to be gold for Square. Are they "back"? Time will tell, but I am hopeful.
            FF14 has been amazing too since 2015 with all the expansions, a mile better than the base game.
                FF14 is not just amazing - it’s honestly become one of my favorite entries in the entire franchise. It’s something special.

I feel like such a fool for thinking of it as “just another MMO” for years before I started playing.
                    I heard people say that for years and it kept me persisting with the game, I struggled through ARR and especially the inbetween quests before Heavensward. Then you get a flying mount and the writing dramatically improves and suddenly it's incredible. I wish they would cut out more of ARR so its easier to get into, like cut 50% more.
                        With a fairly recent patch, they did remove quite a bit of the “filler” from the base game and the epilogue leading into Heavensward! That content is still nowhere near as excellent as everything which follows it, but it’s definitely more streamlined now. 

Like you said though, Heavensward is when the game really began to hit its stride. The storytelling from that point on is not just the best I’ve seen in an MMO, it’s some of the best I’ve seen in an RPG, period.
                Yes. That's why I'm honestly not at all worried about XVI not being quality. I think at the very *least* it will be good.
                    I just hope the combat takes influence from 7R.
                        We’ll see. As a DmC vet tho, watching that trailer gave me some hardcore DMC/Bayonetta vibes. I’m hoping they take the DMC5 route and have multiple playable characters all who feel different from eachother
                        It might. Although with the combat director being of DMC fame, it might lean more towards that. A hybrid of the two isn't out of the question.
                            It just has to have a playable party and strategy in combat. I assume SE realise that after the reception to 7R, but I'm a little nervous.
            Nier Automata, DQXI, KH3+Remind and FFVIIR. For me they came back.
                Yeah, fair enough. They did a great job with the re-release of DQXI. They added *a lot* to it. Hopefully it continues and there's another Golden Age ahead for them here.
            Don't forget!!! Dragon Quest XII is also in development currently so expect that within the next year or two, honestly can't wait!
                That soon? Nice! DQXI was my first game of the series and I really enjoyed it. I loved the locations and it just had a lot of charm to it. At the time I was really in the mood for a turn based RPG and this game really scratched that itch.
            [deleted]
                Same. Some of my best early gaming memories were courtesy of Squaresoft.
            It’s certainly improvement from PS3 era.
                Yeah, that was rock bottom for them, even though I thought the XIII games were alright, but definitely not the quality we had been used to.
            And the Nier remaster/remake! AAAAAAaaaaaa 24 days left
                Yes! So other than the protagonist being the brother and not the father, are there any other changes in Replicant? Do thinks play out exactly the same otherwise?
                    It should. Combat is remade from the ground up and the soundtrack and voice acting are redone but story and locations should be mostly the same. I do hope that the word system is changed but we'll have to see.
                        OK. Yeah, I'm really looking forward to going back in. It's been such a long time since I played the original Nier and it was a unique experience. I'm really glad Square is bringing Replicant over.
Exactly. You'll never hear me complain about paying for Hearts of Stone or Blood and Wine. They were worth every penny, and everything that DLC should aspire to be. If Integrade comes even close to living up to either of those I am 100% thrilled. I mean hell, Blood and Wine was my GotY as an expansion, lol.
And not just good.. a genuine supplement to the game, rather than part of the game that should have been there without the extra charge.  I paid for the DLC for Horizon: Zero Dawn and was satisfied, but I don't feel the same way about Yuffie because she was in the original game, sidequest or not.  I'm glad they're not taking that further.
You will if it delays part 2 for 3 more years
    They have said they’re going to focus on part 2 rather than DLC.
New and Good and correctly adds to story
Plus a proper Super Boss in the form of Weiss for pure fan-service and giving us that kind of KH Final Mix type of challenge where we can test our skills against secret bosses that hint at the next game and story beats, etc. I always loved the Final Mixes so having a sort of FF VII Final Mix in between each game is honestly perfect.
    Yo I did not even think of the final mix parallel with secret super bosses. Let Weiss be as challenging as Lingering Will was the first time I tried it. Please SE...
    >I always loved the Final Mixes so having a sort of FF VII Final Mix in between each game is honestly perfect.

But that won't happen anymore. He just told us this. 😐
        Uhhhh...no...no he didn't. He just said there will be no more DLC after Intergrade and they're focusing on Part 2. And then I 100% guarantee that after Part 2, it will also have another in-between version similar to Intergrade which will be its "Final Mix." 

Intergrade is already a Final Mix, it has new story beats, cutscenes, some enhancements here and there, fixes, new areas and new Post-Game content (like secret bosses, hence why they added Weiss into it.) 

It's exactly the same thing, it's from the same director. I always assumed he would do this between games because it keeps people a bit satiated until the next game. He hasn't ruled out doing this for every single part at all, all he stated was that they are now focusing on Part 2 and Intergrade is the only DLC coming for Part 1...which makes complete and total sense.
            Wrong.

Nomura: "The roadwork we have laid out to complete the entire story takes priority, and if we are to ever add DLC, it will not be until after everything has been done."

The entire story. Not just a portion of the story(Part 2), but the entire thing.
                You read into it waaaayyyy too much but feel free to remind me in a couple years when I'm inevitably right and we get a Part 2 equivalent of Intergrade.
Yeah, actually, in my initial post, I didn't even mention the great job they've already done with the first part. 😆 But, yeah, it'll be nice to get some "hold over" content. I'm even including Ever Crisis in that which could be really good. Battle royal games like First Soldier aren't really my cup of tea, but I hope it does alright.
Yes, I said that. 😏
    Oh, yes, you did!
Do you really? I thought it was included with the PS5 upgrade for free
    If you upgrade from a ps4 version it's not included
        Everything I had read said only the free ps plus version wasn’t free? I can’t find anything clarifying it either way so now I’m confused
        You’re right, just found an article that specified that
Understandable. This was basically Square ripping off the bandaid and saying that the rest of the parts are not going to be on PS4. That is not surprising since the old hardware held back the first game (it's still a good looking game, though). But, people have the right to be upset as the PS4 is a large user base to ignore. With the PS5 launch being what it is, hopefully in another year or so PS5s will be more readily available. I mean, I get they wanted to use this to show off experiment with PS5 features, but it is odd to just not release a PS4 version as well. This could've been partly a SONY decision to help move more PS5 units.
considering the PS4 version had awful load time and egregious texture disparities that were actually a bug they couldn't fix, why would you expect them to release DLC with the same problems due to the console it's on?
    Well they released the actual game on PS4 so obviously that stuff didn't matter to them, right?
        It was a sacrifice due to technical limitation that 100% bothered them lol. It’s like feeling ok about showing up to work in sweat pants just because you’re also wearing a dress shirt and tie... why limit themselves with the problems of last gen when they can solve the issues and get people to buy the console they will need for the next game in the series?
She was in the original game, but really wasn't a major character. She will be now and she's getting more exposition, and we'll see how her actions in Midgar had an affect on the story for the first part that we didn't see. I think the fact they're taking the time to make a minor character in the original and actually have her have a bigger impact in the story is worth it. We'll probably get something similar for the next part, perhaps with Vincent.
The OG was a single 40-80 hour game. The Remake series is not the same amount of content, not even close, drawing equivalence like that is silly.
Well, yes, but she was extra content and completely missable. The end FMV doesn't have her for that reason. If VII was made today, she would be a dlc character through and through.

Same with Vincent. You can cut both out and not lose out on the VII experience. 

Yuffie is one of my favorites so I'm glad she got her own DLC and she's in the game, but she isn't a core part of the original.
"ridiculous notion"? you want a product, you have to pay for it. they have to pay the people that put in the time to make this product. they do not owe you anything just because you paid them $60 a year ago.
    ....And that’s your opinion.
It could be worse, it could be the FFXV model. Yeah, they're going to milk you with this. I think everyone saw this coming. If you have the PS4 version, you're getting the upgrade for free and paying a bit extra for a few more hours of story. I really don't think it's that big of a deal. This is all they're doing. They are working hard on the next part.
So, you don't have the PS4 installed now? If not, redownload it, then it'll upgrade when the update is released. The only version of the game that's not eligible for the upgrade is the free one that was made available through PS recently.

If you don't have a save anywhere then you're going to have to start over. The PS4 saves will work for the PS5 version after the upgrade.
    Nope, we moved and I figured I had no need for the PS4 anymore so it's been in storage.

Thanks for the info -- 

1) re-download on PS5 through my existing account/prior PS4 purchase. (will have my saves)  
2) Game will auto update when PS5 update comes and I can buy DLC.

Is this accurate?
        Yes.
            Great, thanks for the help.
It's a good way to figure out fixes to the original and allows them to play with some new ideas for the next part. I noticed there seem to be team-up moves that were not present in the base game. Probably seeing what might work so the next game will rock.
Well typically game companies dont outright lie, only on rare occasions. They stated there would be no DLC before part 1 dropped, yet here we are. 

Technically you cant buy it separately so I guess it's not actually DLC but added content to the ps5 version
    Huh I never saw that statement, any idea how to find it? I'm very surprised I missed it.
To be fair >!I sort of doubt either Yuffie or Vincent will be optional this time around. There was a charm to older Final Fantasies that had optional/secret characters, but I imagine with how much work it is to implement fully voiced, playable characters and how much more complicated the storytelling is, especially if they continue to pull in spin-offs where Yuffie and Vincent weren't optional, then there's no logical way they can be optional secret characters in Remake.!<

If there's more DLC, though, it could be a great way to start working with characters we probably won't see for awhile. >!I don't know how they'd do it, but it could be a way to raise hype about Cid, or Vincent, or even Cait Sith if we're not going to see them for awhile.!< Could also be fun to have DLC that explores some of the backstories of the characters we already have. I would've thought it'd be cool to have a Red XIII DLC that goes into his >!pre-Midgar solo adventure and ends with him getting captured by Hojo.!<
    Fair points, and I don't think any character will be optional this time, but I wanted to point out that Bioware has def laid the groundwork for how to do awesome, fully realized party members with storylines who are optional.
        Oh, for sure. I personally love secret/optional characters. I remember playing Dragon Age Origins >!and my brother was shocked that I had Wynne in my party. He thought she was just some random old lady you were supposed to kill when you encountered her in the tower.!< I also miss the days of like, Final Fantasy VI when there were TONS of optional characters, I don't think I ever would've found some of them if not for a guide.
There is no way that yuffie/vincent will be optional characters.
    I mean considering Yuffie is already DLC, its plausible
Yea exactly, the first games on a new system never come close to the ones at the end of its life (I'm sure there are exceptions) put breath of fire 3 against FFIX on ps1 for example, obviously things have come a long way but if square enix can get a foot in the door from this DLC to work out some kinks, it's worth it.
    > ...this is an excellent way to test what they can pull out of the bag on ps5.

I thought you were saying the dlc was gonna show off what the PS5 is capable of with this comment. My bad if I misrepresented your opinion. 

My expectations for the DLC is that the most "power" we are going to get from the PS5 is the resolution and fps upgrades already stated.
the ps plus version won't get the upgrade to the ps5 version. this and ps plus requires an ongoing subscription.
    well that sucks!
If the battle royale team was working on Part 2 I'd be worried.
Definitely not. While I appreciate that Square listened to the side of fans who wanted a more legitimate *remake* more in line with the original presentation, the split up of the stories as well as the gross gacha element is pretty disgusting. Far removed from the team making the remake.
    While I hate gacha mobile games, they’re absolutely huge in Japan, so to a certain extent, I can’t really blame SE for catering at least something to those gamers.
Do we have any confirmation of that?  I'm genuinely asking.  Genshin Impact made a billion dollars. . .so far.  Its a different world now.  I hope you're right but honestly it wouldn't surprise me if they dropped literally everything and scrambled to mobile gacha up their most popular franchise.
    > Creative Business Unit I is led by Yoshinori Kitase who was the head of Business Division 1 and focuses on Final Fantasy single player titles, spin-offs, and Kingdom Hearts games. The department comprises the former Business Division 1 (Mainline single player Final Fantasy series), Business Division 3 (Kingdom Hearts, Final Fantasy spin-offs, The World Ends with You, SaGa series), and Business Division 4 (Final Fantasy spin-offs produced with external companies, e.g., Dissidia Final Fantasy NT, Theatrhythm Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy Record Keeper).

> Creative Business Unit IV is led by Hirokazu Nishikado and focuses on the Mana series, along with remasters, ports, and mobile games.

You have it here. Regardless on how they define Ever Crisis/First Soldier,(either a mobile game of a spin-off) they're both separated from the main team.

Even if they're in the same Creative Division and Share Kitase as a lead, it's still 2 completely different teams. The former BD1 is working on the remake while the former BD4 is working on the mobile games. With Mobius FF shutting down a while ago, they had openings for new projects
They were supposedly(don't recall the source, just people talking about it) going to have a chapter on Tifa's activities post reactor 5 until Corneo.
    Based on the Yuffie trailer, it seems like we will be seeing at least some of that content.
Yeah but if they'd have focused their resources it would be released sooner (hopefully by the time I can get a console!). I remember when FF7r dropped and they said they weren't going to do DLC or anything, just moving on to part 2
    It's better they cut their PS5 developing teeth on this than part 2.
[deleted]
    Base PS4 is at the end of its lifetime, came out 2014 its been 8 years. Obviously PC isn't, nobody said so. Do you want to wait double the time for them to develop the game for Ps4/Ps5 and even then would you be happy playing a much inferior graphical version that people will make fun of how bad it looks?
        [deleted]
            Saying obsolete was probably an exaggeration, I agree. However it does seem like Squenix wants to always deliver the best ground breaking graphics with every installment and they just can't anymore on the PS4. They also may have signed a deal with Sony to help them boost PS5 sales... but that's another story. One thing for sure is that games developed specifically for one system tend to look and feel immensely better than the multiplat ones which also require a lot more manpower to port to the other platforms.
            >who puts graphics as secondary to gameplay and story

But the gameplay was also negatively affected by being on last gen hardware.
                [deleted]
                    The world design was most limited by last gen hardware, along with forcing characters through small cracks constantly to hide loading screens.
                        Yeah this - The major difference between PS4/PS5 is the PS5s ability to just load stuff at speed. PS4 has been around for a longtime now, and when you make a game on the 4 you have to assume your player is going to be using the original unit, not the pro. So you have to build your game around those specs. When you exlude your game to the PS5 it can change how you structure the entire experience because you don't have to worry nearly so much about loading things in.
And they should have made the DLC available on PS4 and continued the remake on PS5. Or not released the base game at all on PS4. 

Ya'll can downvote me all you want, I will fucking die on this hill.
    Not much valid reasons to demand that it should be on PS4 based on the reviews the game got in the PS4. To solve this, they went after PS5 and used the faster platform to add more features and the DLC for a better experience.

And yeah, I think you will fucking die of your PS5 thirst because don't act like it is THAT essential and it is Part 2. You will get a PS5 before Part 2 unless you don't actually buy it.
Yeah, if you can fucking get a ps5.
Yeah I guess you're right. They said "multiple parts". But, I'm surprised they are only planning to do one additional one and that's all. Wasn't there talk of remaking crisis core, etc.
    ever crisis encompasses the crisis core remake.

also, the language that is used doesn't mean only one sequel.
        Ahh okay awesome. Thanks!
Oh okay gotcha
Balancing that would be insane.
What? Do people have to pay for part 2?
    Yes part two will be a full and complete game much like part 1.
        So you are basically paying 120 dollars for a 60 dollars game?
            Why do you say it’s a 60 dollar game?
                Why do we have to pay for part 2?
                    The same reason you have to play for uncharted part 2, Uncharted 4 and the new god of war.

The remake is the first game in  a series, each part is a fully complete game.
                    It will be a full release much like the recent remake. The original game is being remade as a trilogy.
                        So they are dividing up 1 game into 3 games for 60 dollars each? Are you saying that they are basically selling a 60 dollar game for 180 dollars? The original version is like 15 dollars on Steam right now...
                            Video game development has changed a lot since the days of the original. There have been many advancements which have improved the gaming experience is areas such as graphics, animations, gameplay and much more. Compare the number of polygons, textures, detail and roughly hours long it would take to create cloud for the current gen vs the original. These differences apply to all aspects of game development. 

If you want extra clarification on anything I’ve mentioned please feel free to ask.
                            Feel free to play the original instead then. But just so you know the original ff7 was not $15 when it first came out more than 20 years ago.
                            Yes... that's the same thing Blizzard did with Starcraft 2. The Terran, Zerg, & Protoss campaigns were all separate releases $60 each.
If we don't get levels carried over why do the characters keep getting exp then? I hope they explain that if this unfolds.
Thought he left becauuuuuuuuuse they were cancelled? O_O
    Wouldn't hold my breath for a definitive answer from Square Enix about that situation, they are a japanese company, and Tabata probably signed a non disclosure agreement upon leaving.

We will never know if Square decided to cancel the second season pass and Tabata felt that was unacceptable because it was promised to fans already after so many issues, or if it was the other way around, Tabata deciding to just leave which made Square cancel the remaining DLCs.

Personally I feel the first one is more plausible since most content post Ignis was made without Tabata as a director anyway, they could have clearly worked without him, I mean the project continued without Nomura in the first place anyway.
        Yeah I think it's the first as they are probably trying to make us believe something to be true even it isn't to prevent backlash and Tabata can't say a word because non disclosure agreement. Necessary evil those non disclosure agreements are.
            Doesnt he still work under square just running the luminous engine Studios that square owns? I wouldnt expect there to have been some big fallout where he had to sign a NDA since technically he is still employed through SE
                He left both Square and Luminous Productions, Square was aparently impressed with his performance with FFXV, he took a project on the verge of being cancelled, rebooted it, released it in only 3 years of development with the new engine and came out with a success (despite it's flaws of course). So around the time of release of Episode Prompto or Episode Ignis, Square created Luminous Productions and made him the leading guy of that team. Really nice position, which makes his departure so strange. He left at the time of the new wave of DLCs being cancelled for unconfirmed reasons.
                    Why do you think those reasons are unconfirmed though? My mom always said if you had nothing good to say don't say anything at all.
                        Just how big companies handle things, they don't usually talk about why someone left or was let go, despite all the brand damage Don Mattrick did to Xbox he was still simply "transfered" to Zynga, not fired. The original director for version 1.0 of FFXIV wasn't fired either, he was simply moved to a different position.

There are so many possible reasons for him leaving and so little to go from. Maybe there was drama, maybe there was none at all and it was simply Tabata wanting to pursue a different career path. Maybe they wanted to cancel the DLCs  for a while, and Tabata leaving was the perfect excuse. Who knows.
                You always signed a Non Disclosure agreement with a company when making something like a video game. Keeps you from leaking the game out or telling too much about it that won't be in the game. I really don't think Square Enix didn't want to put anymore funds in the game.
                    Yea I agree. Even though I love the game, I think SE and the majority of the fan base was ready to move on. Cant wait to see what they have in store for Forspoken. Wish they would have just kept the name Project Athia. Sounds better to me
                        I mean some fans actually thought they were going to "finish" the game though even if it had a very unrealistic amount of work. Some fans thought of it as a promise with unrealistic expectations. How about not having a game go into development hell? You could say that "Well they needed all hands on deck to fix FF14!" which again is also Square Enix's in a way. Why should other projects suffer because someone else messed up? I just think it's wrong.
yeah when they announced season 2 i was really surprised because I thought all was said and done for the game at that point.
Heheh it was more of a silly joke on my part, plus it always surprised me how nomura gets so much shit for his style, yet every game he's credited on are wild successes, while excuses were being made (and rightly so, I just felt the same should be extended nomura, which it rarely is) for tabata who's credits are generally among the least popular games
    To be fair considering FFXV's development hell, Tabata only got put in the position he did because Nomura kept changing things up, which delayed KH3, XV, *and* 7r. He had to make due with what he had.

Going by KH3's re:Mind DLC ending, Nomura is still very salty over being removed from XV.
        Ngl, I lost interest in KH3 halfway between games, I dunno how cause I used to love the series, but I own it, just can't bring myself to finish it, so I haven't seen re:mind.

But having gorged on all available info on 15 and the dev history of it, I can definitely understand why he is salty. I know its never ever going to happen, but I would've loved a XV Nomura cut heheh.

And yeah, Tabata definitely had an uphill battle, and it's understandable why the game shipped in the state it did, HOWEVER, if I worked on a script, outline, functioning engine that needed a lot of work for nearly a decade, and our bosses takes that from me and gives it to you telling you you have 1 year to finish it, would your solution be to scrap a decade of work, and just start over?

Point is, Tabata didn't have nearly enough time, but he kinda threw the baby out with the bathwater, it'd take way less time to untangle the mess 2 console generations had done with the engine and just finish it, than do it all on an unrealistic schedule.

Even annual games are only able to be annual because they switch up studios or reuse assets like crazy, they don't build an entire 50hr rpg with cutting edge tech from scratch
i mean dlc thats worth 2 chapters (est 2 hours) of content? which you can squeeze and grind out to more? i agree dlc gonna be dope
[deleted]
    Indeed. With Intergrade, FFXVI, Forspoken, Outriders and the continuation of the Remake, these next couple of years are going to be gold for Square. Are they "back"? Time will tell, but I am hopeful.
        FF14 has been amazing too since 2015 with all the expansions, a mile better than the base game.
            FF14 is not just amazing - it’s honestly become one of my favorite entries in the entire franchise. It’s something special.

I feel like such a fool for thinking of it as “just another MMO” for years before I started playing.
                I heard people say that for years and it kept me persisting with the game, I struggled through ARR and especially the inbetween quests before Heavensward. Then you get a flying mount and the writing dramatically improves and suddenly it's incredible. I wish they would cut out more of ARR so its easier to get into, like cut 50% more.
                    With a fairly recent patch, they did remove quite a bit of the “filler” from the base game and the epilogue leading into Heavensward! That content is still nowhere near as excellent as everything which follows it, but it’s definitely more streamlined now. 

Like you said though, Heavensward is when the game really began to hit its stride. The storytelling from that point on is not just the best I’ve seen in an MMO, it’s some of the best I’ve seen in an RPG, period.
            Yes. That's why I'm honestly not at all worried about XVI not being quality. I think at the very *least* it will be good.
                I just hope the combat takes influence from 7R.
                    We’ll see. As a DmC vet tho, watching that trailer gave me some hardcore DMC/Bayonetta vibes. I’m hoping they take the DMC5 route and have multiple playable characters all who feel different from eachother
                    It might. Although with the combat director being of DMC fame, it might lean more towards that. A hybrid of the two isn't out of the question.
                        It just has to have a playable party and strategy in combat. I assume SE realise that after the reception to 7R, but I'm a little nervous.
        Nier Automata, DQXI, KH3+Remind and FFVIIR. For me they came back.
            Yeah, fair enough. They did a great job with the re-release of DQXI. They added *a lot* to it. Hopefully it continues and there's another Golden Age ahead for them here.
        Don't forget!!! Dragon Quest XII is also in development currently so expect that within the next year or two, honestly can't wait!
            That soon? Nice! DQXI was my first game of the series and I really enjoyed it. I loved the locations and it just had a lot of charm to it. At the time I was really in the mood for a turn based RPG and this game really scratched that itch.
        [deleted]
            Same. Some of my best early gaming memories were courtesy of Squaresoft.
        It’s certainly improvement from PS3 era.
            Yeah, that was rock bottom for them, even though I thought the XIII games were alright, but definitely not the quality we had been used to.
        And the Nier remaster/remake! AAAAAAaaaaaa 24 days left
            Yes! So other than the protagonist being the brother and not the father, are there any other changes in Replicant? Do thinks play out exactly the same otherwise?
                It should. Combat is remade from the ground up and the soundtrack and voice acting are redone but story and locations should be mostly the same. I do hope that the word system is changed but we'll have to see.
                    OK. Yeah, I'm really looking forward to going back in. It's been such a long time since I played the original Nier and it was a unique experience. I'm really glad Square is bringing Replicant over.
They have said they’re going to focus on part 2 rather than DLC.
Yo I did not even think of the final mix parallel with secret super bosses. Let Weiss be as challenging as Lingering Will was the first time I tried it. Please SE...
>I always loved the Final Mixes so having a sort of FF VII Final Mix in between each game is honestly perfect.

But that won't happen anymore. He just told us this. 😐
    Uhhhh...no...no he didn't. He just said there will be no more DLC after Intergrade and they're focusing on Part 2. And then I 100% guarantee that after Part 2, it will also have another in-between version similar to Intergrade which will be its "Final Mix." 

Intergrade is already a Final Mix, it has new story beats, cutscenes, some enhancements here and there, fixes, new areas and new Post-Game content (like secret bosses, hence why they added Weiss into it.) 

It's exactly the same thing, it's from the same director. I always assumed he would do this between games because it keeps people a bit satiated until the next game. He hasn't ruled out doing this for every single part at all, all he stated was that they are now focusing on Part 2 and Intergrade is the only DLC coming for Part 1...which makes complete and total sense.
        Wrong.

Nomura: "The roadwork we have laid out to complete the entire story takes priority, and if we are to ever add DLC, it will not be until after everything has been done."

The entire story. Not just a portion of the story(Part 2), but the entire thing.
            You read into it waaaayyyy too much but feel free to remind me in a couple years when I'm inevitably right and we get a Part 2 equivalent of Intergrade.
Oh, yes, you did!
If you upgrade from a ps4 version it's not included
    Everything I had read said only the free ps plus version wasn’t free? I can’t find anything clarifying it either way so now I’m confused
    You’re right, just found an article that specified that
Well they released the actual game on PS4 so obviously that stuff didn't matter to them, right?
    It was a sacrifice due to technical limitation that 100% bothered them lol. It’s like feeling ok about showing up to work in sweat pants just because you’re also wearing a dress shirt and tie... why limit themselves with the problems of last gen when they can solve the issues and get people to buy the console they will need for the next game in the series?
....And that’s your opinion.
Nope, we moved and I figured I had no need for the PS4 anymore so it's been in storage.

Thanks for the info -- 

1) re-download on PS5 through my existing account/prior PS4 purchase. (will have my saves)  
2) Game will auto update when PS5 update comes and I can buy DLC.

Is this accurate?
    Yes.
        Great, thanks for the help.
Huh I never saw that statement, any idea how to find it? I'm very surprised I missed it.
Fair points, and I don't think any character will be optional this time, but I wanted to point out that Bioware has def laid the groundwork for how to do awesome, fully realized party members with storylines who are optional.
    Oh, for sure. I personally love secret/optional characters. I remember playing Dragon Age Origins >!and my brother was shocked that I had Wynne in my party. He thought she was just some random old lady you were supposed to kill when you encountered her in the tower.!< I also miss the days of like, Final Fantasy VI when there were TONS of optional characters, I don't think I ever would've found some of them if not for a guide.
I mean considering Yuffie is already DLC, its plausible
> ...this is an excellent way to test what they can pull out of the bag on ps5.

I thought you were saying the dlc was gonna show off what the PS5 is capable of with this comment. My bad if I misrepresented your opinion. 

My expectations for the DLC is that the most "power" we are going to get from the PS5 is the resolution and fps upgrades already stated.
well that sucks!
While I hate gacha mobile games, they’re absolutely huge in Japan, so to a certain extent, I can’t really blame SE for catering at least something to those gamers.
> Creative Business Unit I is led by Yoshinori Kitase who was the head of Business Division 1 and focuses on Final Fantasy single player titles, spin-offs, and Kingdom Hearts games. The department comprises the former Business Division 1 (Mainline single player Final Fantasy series), Business Division 3 (Kingdom Hearts, Final Fantasy spin-offs, The World Ends with You, SaGa series), and Business Division 4 (Final Fantasy spin-offs produced with external companies, e.g., Dissidia Final Fantasy NT, Theatrhythm Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy Record Keeper).

> Creative Business Unit IV is led by Hirokazu Nishikado and focuses on the Mana series, along with remasters, ports, and mobile games.

You have it here. Regardless on how they define Ever Crisis/First Soldier,(either a mobile game of a spin-off) they're both separated from the main team.

Even if they're in the same Creative Division and Share Kitase as a lead, it's still 2 completely different teams. The former BD1 is working on the remake while the former BD4 is working on the mobile games. With Mobius FF shutting down a while ago, they had openings for new projects
Based on the Yuffie trailer, it seems like we will be seeing at least some of that content.
It's better they cut their PS5 developing teeth on this than part 2.
Base PS4 is at the end of its lifetime, came out 2014 its been 8 years. Obviously PC isn't, nobody said so. Do you want to wait double the time for them to develop the game for Ps4/Ps5 and even then would you be happy playing a much inferior graphical version that people will make fun of how bad it looks?
    [deleted]
        Saying obsolete was probably an exaggeration, I agree. However it does seem like Squenix wants to always deliver the best ground breaking graphics with every installment and they just can't anymore on the PS4. They also may have signed a deal with Sony to help them boost PS5 sales... but that's another story. One thing for sure is that games developed specifically for one system tend to look and feel immensely better than the multiplat ones which also require a lot more manpower to port to the other platforms.
        >who puts graphics as secondary to gameplay and story

But the gameplay was also negatively affected by being on last gen hardware.
            [deleted]
                The world design was most limited by last gen hardware, along with forcing characters through small cracks constantly to hide loading screens.
                    Yeah this - The major difference between PS4/PS5 is the PS5s ability to just load stuff at speed. PS4 has been around for a longtime now, and when you make a game on the 4 you have to assume your player is going to be using the original unit, not the pro. So you have to build your game around those specs. When you exlude your game to the PS5 it can change how you structure the entire experience because you don't have to worry nearly so much about loading things in.
Not much valid reasons to demand that it should be on PS4 based on the reviews the game got in the PS4. To solve this, they went after PS5 and used the faster platform to add more features and the DLC for a better experience.

And yeah, I think you will fucking die of your PS5 thirst because don't act like it is THAT essential and it is Part 2. You will get a PS5 before Part 2 unless you don't actually buy it.
ever crisis encompasses the crisis core remake.

also, the language that is used doesn't mean only one sequel.
    Ahh okay awesome. Thanks!
Yes part two will be a full and complete game much like part 1.
    So you are basically paying 120 dollars for a 60 dollars game?
        Why do you say it’s a 60 dollar game?
            Why do we have to pay for part 2?
                The same reason you have to play for uncharted part 2, Uncharted 4 and the new god of war.

The remake is the first game in  a series, each part is a fully complete game.
                It will be a full release much like the recent remake. The original game is being remade as a trilogy.
                    So they are dividing up 1 game into 3 games for 60 dollars each? Are you saying that they are basically selling a 60 dollar game for 180 dollars? The original version is like 15 dollars on Steam right now...
                        Video game development has changed a lot since the days of the original. There have been many advancements which have improved the gaming experience is areas such as graphics, animations, gameplay and much more. Compare the number of polygons, textures, detail and roughly hours long it would take to create cloud for the current gen vs the original. These differences apply to all aspects of game development. 

If you want extra clarification on anything I’ve mentioned please feel free to ask.
                        Feel free to play the original instead then. But just so you know the original ff7 was not $15 when it first came out more than 20 years ago.
                        Yes... that's the same thing Blizzard did with Starcraft 2. The Terran, Zerg, & Protoss campaigns were all separate releases $60 each.
Wouldn't hold my breath for a definitive answer from Square Enix about that situation, they are a japanese company, and Tabata probably signed a non disclosure agreement upon leaving.

We will never know if Square decided to cancel the second season pass and Tabata felt that was unacceptable because it was promised to fans already after so many issues, or if it was the other way around, Tabata deciding to just leave which made Square cancel the remaining DLCs.

Personally I feel the first one is more plausible since most content post Ignis was made without Tabata as a director anyway, they could have clearly worked without him, I mean the project continued without Nomura in the first place anyway.
    Yeah I think it's the first as they are probably trying to make us believe something to be true even it isn't to prevent backlash and Tabata can't say a word because non disclosure agreement. Necessary evil those non disclosure agreements are.
        Doesnt he still work under square just running the luminous engine Studios that square owns? I wouldnt expect there to have been some big fallout where he had to sign a NDA since technically he is still employed through SE
            He left both Square and Luminous Productions, Square was aparently impressed with his performance with FFXV, he took a project on the verge of being cancelled, rebooted it, released it in only 3 years of development with the new engine and came out with a success (despite it's flaws of course). So around the time of release of Episode Prompto or Episode Ignis, Square created Luminous Productions and made him the leading guy of that team. Really nice position, which makes his departure so strange. He left at the time of the new wave of DLCs being cancelled for unconfirmed reasons.
                Why do you think those reasons are unconfirmed though? My mom always said if you had nothing good to say don't say anything at all.
                    Just how big companies handle things, they don't usually talk about why someone left or was let go, despite all the brand damage Don Mattrick did to Xbox he was still simply "transfered" to Zynga, not fired. The original director for version 1.0 of FFXIV wasn't fired either, he was simply moved to a different position.

There are so many possible reasons for him leaving and so little to go from. Maybe there was drama, maybe there was none at all and it was simply Tabata wanting to pursue a different career path. Maybe they wanted to cancel the DLCs  for a while, and Tabata leaving was the perfect excuse. Who knows.
            You always signed a Non Disclosure agreement with a company when making something like a video game. Keeps you from leaking the game out or telling too much about it that won't be in the game. I really don't think Square Enix didn't want to put anymore funds in the game.
                Yea I agree. Even though I love the game, I think SE and the majority of the fan base was ready to move on. Cant wait to see what they have in store for Forspoken. Wish they would have just kept the name Project Athia. Sounds better to me
                    I mean some fans actually thought they were going to "finish" the game though even if it had a very unrealistic amount of work. Some fans thought of it as a promise with unrealistic expectations. How about not having a game go into development hell?

Going by KH3's re:Mind DLC ending, Nomura is still very salty over being removed from XV.
    Ngl, I lost interest in KH3 halfway between games, I dunno how cause I used to love the series, but I own it, just can't bring myself to finish it, so I haven't seen re:mind.

But having gorged on all available info on 15 and the dev history of it, I can definitely understand why he is salty. I know its never ever going to happen, but I would've loved a XV Nomura cut heheh.

    Doesnt he still work under square just running the luminous engine Studios that square owns? I wouldnt expect there to have been some big fallout where he had to sign a NDA since technically he is still employed through SE
        He left both Square and Luminous Productions, Square was aparently impressed with his performance with FFXV, he took a project on the verge of being cancelled, rebooted it, released it in only 3 years of development with the new engine and came out with a success (despite it's flaws of course). So around the time of release of Episode Prompto or Episode Ignis, Square created Luminous Productions and made him the leading guy of that team. Really nice position, which makes his departure so strange. He left at the time of the new wave of DLCs being cancelled for unconfirmed reasons.
            Why do you think those reasons are unconfirmed though? My mom always said if you had nothing good to say don't say anything at all.
                Just how big companies handle things, they don't usually talk about why someone left or was let go, despite all the brand damage Don Mattrick did to Xbox he was still simply "transfered" to Zynga, not fired. The original director for version 1.0 of FFXIV wasn't fired either, he was simply moved to a different position.

There are so many possible reasons for him leaving and so little to go from. Maybe there was drama, maybe there was none at all and it was simply Tabata wanting to pursue a different career path. Maybe they wanted to cancel the DLCs  for a while, and Tabata leaving was the perfect excuse. Who knows.
        You always signed a Non Disclosure agreement with a company when making something like a video game. Keeps you from leaking the game out or telling too much about it that won't be in the game. I really don't think Square Enix didn't want to put anymore funds in the game.
            Yea I agree. Even though I love the game, I think SE and the majority of the fan base was ready to move on. Cant wait to see what they have in store for Forspoken. Wish they would have just kept the name Project Athia. Sounds better to me
                I mean some fans actually thought they were going to "finish" the game though even if it had a very unrealistic amount of work. Some fans thought of it as a promise with unrealistic expectations. How about not having a game go into development hell? You could say that "Well they needed all hands on deck to fix FF14!" which again is also Square Enix's in a way. Why should other projects suffer because someone else messed up? I just think it's wrong.
Ngl, I lost interest in KH3 halfway between games, I dunno how cause I used to love the series, but I own it, just can't bring myself to finish it, so I haven't seen re:mind.

But having gorged on all available info on 15 and the dev history of it, I can definitely understand why he is salty. I know its never ever going to happen, but I would've loved a XV Nomura cut heheh.

And yeah, Tabata definitely had an uphill battle, and it's understandable why the game shipped in the state it did, HOWEVER, if I worked on a script, outline, functioning engine that needed a lot of work for nearly a decade, and our bosses takes that from me and gives it to you telling you you have 1 year to finish it, would your solution be to scrap a decade of work, and just start over?

Point is, Tabata didn't have nearly enough time, but he kinda threw the baby out with the bathwater, it'd take way less time to untangle the mess 2 console generations had done with the engine and just finish it, than do it all on an unrealistic schedule.

Even annual games are only able to be annual because they switch up studios or reuse assets like crazy, they don't build an entire 50hr rpg with cutting edge tech from scratch
FF14 has been amazing too since 2015 with all the expansions, a mile better than the base game.
    FF14 is not just amazing - it’s honestly become one of my favorite entries in the entire franchise. It’s something special.

I feel like such a fool for thinking of it as “just another MMO” for years before I started playing.
        I heard people say that for years and it kept me persisting with the game, I struggled through ARR and especially the inbetween quests before Heavensward. Then you get a flying mount and the writing dramatically improves and suddenly it's incredible. I wish they would cut out more of ARR so its easier to get into, like cut 50% more.
            With a fairly recent patch, they did remove quite a bit of the “filler” from the base game and the epilogue leading into Heavensward! That content is still nowhere near as excellent as everything which follows it, but it’s definitely more streamlined now. 

Like you said though, Heavensward is when the game really began to hit its stride. The storytelling from that point on is not just the best I’ve seen in an MMO, it’s some of the best I’ve seen in an RPG, period.
    Yes. That's why I'm honestly not at all worried about XVI not being quality. I think at the very *least* it will be good.
        I just hope the combat takes influence from 7R.
            We’ll see. As a DmC vet tho, watching that trailer gave me some hardcore DMC/Bayonetta vibes. I’m hoping they take the DMC5 route and have multiple playable characters all who feel different from eachother
            It might. Although with the combat director being of DMC fame, it might lean more towards that. A hybrid of the two isn't out of the question.
                It just has to have a playable party and strategy in combat. I assume SE realise that after the reception to 7R, but I'm a little nervous.
Nier Automata, DQXI, KH3+Remind and FFVIIR. For me they came back.
    Yeah, fair enough. They did a great job with the re-release of DQXI. They added *a lot* to it. Hopefully it continues and there's another Golden Age ahead for them here.
Don't forget!!! Dragon Quest XII is also in development currently so expect that within the next year or two, honestly can't wait!
    That soon? Nice! DQXI was my first game of the series and I really enjoyed it. I loved the locations and it just had a lot of charm to it. At the time I was really in the mood for a turn based RPG and this game really scratched that itch.

    Same. Some of my best early gaming memories were courtesy of Squaresoft.
It’s certainly improvement from PS3 era.
    Yeah, that was rock bottom for them, even though I thought the XIII games were alright, but definitely not the quality we had been used to.
And the Nier remaster/remake! AAAAAAaaaaaa 24 days left
    Yes! So other than the protagonist being the brother and not the father, are there any other changes in Replicant? Do thinks play out exactly the same otherwise?
        It should. Combat is remade from the ground up and the soundtrack and voice acting are redone but story and locations should be mostly the same. I do hope that the word system is changed but we'll have to see.
            OK. Yeah, I'm really looking forward to going back in. It's been such a long time since I played the original Nier and it was a unique experience. I'm really glad Square is bringing Replicant over.
Wrong.

Nomura: "The roadwork we have laid out to complete the entire story takes priority, and if we are to ever add DLC, it will not be until after everything has been done."

The entire story. Not just a portion of the story(Part 2), but the entire thing.
    You read into it waaaayyyy too much but feel free to remind me in a couple years when I'm inevitably right and we get a Part 2 equivalent of Intergrade.
Great, thanks for the help.
Saying obsolete was probably an exaggeration, I agree. However it does seem like Squenix wants to always deliver the best ground breaking graphics with every installment and they just can't anymore on the PS4. They also may have signed a deal with Sony to help them boost PS5 sales... but that's another story. One thing for sure is that games developed specifically for one system tend to look and feel immensely better than the multiplat ones which also require a lot more manpower to port to the other platforms.
>who puts graphics as secondary to gameplay and story

But the gameplay was also negatively affected by being on last gen hardware.
    [deleted]
        The world design was most limited by last gen hardware, along with forcing characters through small cracks constantly to hide loading screens.
            Yeah this - The major difference between PS4/PS5 is the PS5s ability to just load stuff at speed. PS4 has been around for a longtime now, and when you make a game on the 4 you have to assume your player is going to be using the original unit, not the pro. So you have to build your game around those specs. When you exlude your game to the PS5 it can change how you structure the entire experience because you don't have to worry nearly so much about loading things in.
Why do you say it’s a 60 dollar game?
    Why do we have to pay for part 2?
        The same reason you have to play for uncharted part 2, Uncharted 4 and the new god of war.

The remake is the first game in  a series, each part is a fully complete game.
        It will be a full release much like the recent remake. The original game is being remade as a trilogy.
            So they are dividing up 1 game into 3 games for 60 dollars each? Are you saying that they are basically selling a 60 dollar game for 180 dollars? The original version is like 15 dollars on Steam right now...
                Video game development has changed a lot since the days of the original. There have been many advancements which have improved the gaming experience is areas such as graphics, animations, gameplay and much more. Compare the number of polygons, textures, detail and roughly hours long it would take to create cloud for the current gen vs the original. These differences apply to all aspects of game development. 

If you want extra clarification on anything I’ve mentioned please feel free to ask.
                Feel free to play the original instead then. But just so you know the original ff7 was not $15 when it first came out more than 20 years ago.
                Yes... that's the same thing Blizzard did with Starcraft 2. The Terran, Zerg, & Protoss campaigns were all separate releases $60 each.
