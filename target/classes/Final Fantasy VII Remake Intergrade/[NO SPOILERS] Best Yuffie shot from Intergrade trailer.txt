[[[NO SPOILERS] Best Yuffie shot from Intergrade trailer]]





I get major "Princess Garnet kidnapping disguise" vibes from these shots.
    I can't tell you what I'd give for a 9 remake to the level of 7R...
        Samesies. 9 is my most played FF game. Beaten it about 8 or 9 times. The PC mods for it make it even better.
            Mine too, recently got it on steam and installed Moguri mod and wowee! I've been having such a great time :')
            I bought this on PC recently. What mods would you recommend?
            Can you drop what mods you use? I'm intrigued.
    YES THANK YOU!!! She doesn't have the spunk Yuffie has, but the garb just lends itself to Sarah's character (lil Easter egg for vet IX players).  

Another company bought the rights to remake multiple games from a Square Japanese IP, which could mean a IX remake.  It could also mean a lot of other things.  But tbh, after seeing this trailer, it really did get my hopes up a bit thinking this could be Garnet.
I like this more than I should.
Yuffie is not impressed.
    “Am I joke to you?”

You’re wearing a moogle suit.
Her smug aura mocks me
    I do NOT like this painting CHOLLIE
Yuffie was a permanent member in my og team, hope they do justice to her fast-paced fighting in this game, if done right she'll probably be the most fun to play as out of everyone.
    Her combat definitely looks fun from what little we’ve seen.
    Until we get a sephiroth episode and get to play as him (please Square, pleeeease)
        I'm hoping the next installment opens in the Kalm flashback, rolling down the street in the truck with Sephiroth and Cloud, and that Sephiroth is controllable in combat.

But I imagine he likely won't. It'll be like Red XIII, or the original scene in FF7 where you control Cloud and Sephiroth just does his own thing.
             I agree with you, but it's a matter of time before modders get their hands on the pc version and make it possible.
    She was my favorite as well (female, Barret is the best character in the original).

I actually hope her and Vincent don't join the main cast in VIiR. But continue to get their own side games and they, essentially, roll DoC into FF VIIR proper and let them deal with Hojo and Weis.

They can meet the team, and have small playable parts, but I want them to go their own ways... Even if Yuffie and Cloud are motion sick buddies.
Mean muggin'

        Y'all both missed it. Mean Moggin'.
            +1
Hard mode = trying to get a PS5 before Episode Yuffie comes out.
    Oh wow, thank you for the medal! :o
"thuggg liiiiiffee"
No one:

This screenshot: PS4 users when they find out it's only going to PS5.
Thug life.
    *Mog life.
I’m continually impressed by the redesigns. The faces are impeccable.
I e seen the trailer 3 times, and I can't figure out at what time frame this happen.

Look closely at 1:15
        This is a completely different trailer.  Awesome!
I need to find this
Ok I looked it up. Lol
"Meh."
My face when I wake up in the morning and there's still no Ps5 on my desk.
I'm so excited.
    *bonk*
        (ｕ_ｕ*)
Yuffie is a fucking mood.
Yuffie looks high af there lol
So I’ll need the ps5 or can I play it on 4? Is this a side game of the next piece of the remake?
    It’s a DLC for part one. Or more specifically, it’s a DLC for the PS5-upgraded version of part one. So you’ll need a PS5 to play it.
        i wonder if i can copy over my achievements and progress from the ps4 version
            Yeah, that's all part of the package
            You can copy your save data, but it will have a separate trophy list most likely.
                The trophies will copy over as well.
                    Source? Can’t find any official news on the trophies specifically and many on this sub have speculated that it will have a separate list, as this has been the case for most if not all PS5 upgrades.
                        There's a Synchronise trophies function.
                            Vouch.  I did this the minute I got my PS5.  Good luck to all in here still trying to get theirs.
        Ohhh, no wonder I couldn’t buy it from my PS4 COPY that I used on my PS5.
            yeah if you already have the game you'll need to just wait until June 10th to upgrade and buy the DLC.
                Thanks for clearing that up. I thought it would have me buy the whole game again.
I hate that I'm getting Noctis from this.
    ?
        She looks like noctis from FF15 in this picture.
            What, how? Need an example cause I don't see it.
    No hate.
This bullshit is exactly why I didn't want an episodic release. Now they're going to shoe horn all sorts of mini dlc's and we'll never get a singular complete game.
    I'm a 100% sure than we'll get a complete re-release on PS6.
        They could have just upgraded the original.
            Go ahead and play Ever Crisis when it comes out then.
            They already did. It's called Ever Crisis. Enjoy.
                >Ever Crisis

I'll pass on a mobile game. Thanks.
                    You could always emulate it on Bluestacks.
                        At that point, why don't I just find one of the fan made upgrades and play?

Edit: And it's "episodic"
                            How many terabytes do you think a single game can hold? Not reality, dude.
That moogle head looks creepy as f.
ngl that moogle thing looks comfy as fuck
Honest question: why is she wearing that?
    She wore it in Dirge of Cerberus.  That’s not *really* an answer, but here we are.
I want a Yuffie now
I used this for a thumbnail and it fit the topic well! "Why yuffie dlc is not coming to Ps4."
That's prime Yuff right there
EXCITEEDDD more ffvii
