[[My most Calculated. goal of all time - my controller died and I somehow hit a ceiling shot out of it]]





Lmaoo that’s pretty nuts
    DUDE SERIOUSLY. lmaooooooooo I would call this fake if nameplates weren't on and they weren't already dominating, but to get TWO hits (notice his controller died right when he got the first hit) in, one in midair as a pass and into GOAL falling from driving with 0 boost *during a match*. Jesus truly took the wheel as u/ Dim said.
        I genuinely love your enthusiasm
            Thanks for being happy with me, by the way, even if people want to make it weird. 🖤 forgot to reply to the most important comment with all the commotion.

:D
            Smells like satire
                It was true, I mean what are the chances you touch the ball twice and score driving perfectly straight with no boost lmao its so hilarious
                [removed]
                    Why yes, if I may
                    bruh....ok maybe, actually. l 

edit: Sorry, I have no idea what I was saying here. I had to put my phone away. probably that I may be on the spectrum idk.
                    Yo, let’s not just call people autistic for simply getting enthusiastic about shit maybe? Really not cool for people who actually have it. Thanks!
                        As someone that actually has it, I find it hilarious.
                            Cool! As someone who also is on the spectrum, I don’t! This whole normalization of “is he acoustic” and “maybe he has the tism” could really be done without, and many of my autistic friends also feel the same! So maybe default to not doing it, just like we’ve strayed away from calling people retarded.
                                Agreed despite them possibly being right. No one should be assumed to have a disorder just because they show weird behavior while excited or stressed. (but they may be right. regardless, what are the chances of this clip, I mean come on!)?
                        You say this as if there are other morally acceptable times to call a non-autistic person autistic lol
                            That’s not at all what I said, but okay. My take is just don’t call people autistic, don’t call people retarded, just don’t. Is that clear enough for you?
                                It's not what you said, it's the funny implications that could reasonably be misinterpreted by what you said. I'm just saying it was funny is all lol.
                                    Got it, my bad then!
                        I literally have autism…
                            I literally do to, and I’m asking you to maybe not normalize this :) wild that this is a big ask.
                                Alright guys let’s wrap up the autism competition. Congrats you all won.
                                    There’s a competition? Now I have to go min/max my autistic traits, thanks a LOT
                                    Was not intended to be one. Just frustrating when someone uses that as a “since I have it and I’m okay with it, it must mean everyone is ok with it!” I’ve no intent of ill will, it’s just something that is better left unsaid.
                                    Ha, that gave me a good laugh
                                    Take my upvote sir
                                as someone who doesn't have the 'tism, i find it hilarious. 

therefore, the jokes are allowed. thanks!
        this is the energy everyone needs. i can vibe with you unlike all these other comments
            Thanks bruv.
        Controller died on kickoff
            He made a flip tho, so THREE times then?!
    Me when the homie shows me his balls after telling me a joke
Why not just start the clip from the kickoff? I was so confused at first 😂 nice shot, big assist to the man upstairs taking the wheel
    Yeah, and he didn't show the replay which I wanted to see
        I wasn't recording. This is a saved replay unfortunately.
            It’s called editing the clip
                Many people are tech illiterate
                It’s called in-game replays don’t show up in saved replays
                    It’s called editing it after the fact? It’s not that hard.
                        My brother in Christ
                        How the fuck is he gonna edit the replay into the video
                            Dude you’re fucking dense. I’m just saying cut off the first 16 seconds of this video.

>	Why not just start the clip from the kickoff?
                                Most people are taking your comment as you saying you can show the replay of the goal (you know the one where the scorers anthem plays and the players have to skip it in game, that one.) just by editing the saved replay which removes those goal replays completely
                                    damn, i guess most people are stupid then
                                I know what you’re saying but that’s irrelevant to the comment he was replying to.
                                    WDYM??? It’s not in any way. U just can’t admit ur wrong now
                                    You can make your own replay in the saved replays. Do another angle of your own making. It's not that hard.
                            Not that that's the point, but a freestyler was literally caught doing that. It's pretty easy. You can alter car/ball positions and velocities and then have the game simulate your desired replay.
    His keyboard died while editing
        Underrated.
    I was kind of just showing the exact point when the controller died 😂
        I think we would've understood given the caption and the clip 😁 if this happens again, name the kickoff strat "Playing Opossum"
            He actually hit it twice, once right when controller died, but he still could have shortened it a bit.
In one million years you will never hit that shot again. Insanity
    Statistically, you’re almost certainly wrong.
        Statistically, he’d be long dead by then therefore OP is almost certainly correct. 

Two can play at that game
            Touché.
            Statistically it only took him up to 8 years (less depending on when he started playing).
        "You are technically correct, which is the best kind of correct!" - Futurama bureaucrat guy
            He's the top bureaucrat. Don't quote him regulations!
        Shut up nerd
            How to sound stupid!   
By: Average redditor
        depending on how many times his battery dies in game with an input on, i'd say he's quite right
edit: unless you mean it would be less likely
        I disagree. The ‘same’ shot would be defined as:

A goal made after hitting the ball initially, his controller then dying within 1 second after his initial touch, his car then driving up the wall without being bumped off its path by another player, the ball then being passed toward his car, his car then falling on it in order to cause it to be sent into net without it being blocked by someone from the opposing team, and without it being touched by another player on his own team.

That’s a *lot* of conditions to be satisfied. The two main factors that dramatically affect the likelihood of it happening within 1 million years are:

1. The probability of his controller ‘dying’. 

How often does his controller lose its connection relative to the time it operates without issue? 

2. The frequency of play. 

If he plays Rocket League once a year for an hour, you are most certainly wrong. If he plays 16 hours a day, every day, you may be right.
            Nah you’re almost certainly still wrong. Even with just an hour a day, every day, for one million years, would yield ~365 million playable hours (~42,000 playable years) in which to hit this shot. 

Considering this game has been out for ~10 years and OP hit this shot within this time frame, we can estimate the probability of such a shot occurring as 1 in every 10 years (or 4,200 times in every 42,000 years). This corresponds to a probability of 0.1 shots every 1 year. 

Therefore, the probability of the shot NOT occurring again after 42,000 years is approximately (1 - 0.1)^42,000 which is *extremely* close to zero. If the probability of something NOT occurring is essentially zero, then it is essentially guaranteed that it WILL happen.

Q.E.D.
                > Considering this game has been out for ~10 years and OP hit this shot within this time frame, we can estimate the probability of such a shot occurring as 1 in every 10 years (or 4,200 times in every 42,000 years). This corresponds to a probability of 0.1 shots every 1 year. 

This is remarkably-bad reasoning. This would be like saying that because someone won the lottery after playing for 10 years, that we could expect them to hit the lottery every 10 years.

The fact that a single event has occurred, tells us *nothing* about its likelihood of occurring.
                    Fair, I apologize for the tone in my previous comment. As soon as I posted it I realized something was off and have been trying to find a way to rephrase it, but you responded before I had a chance to tweak the logic.

Let’s make some rough assumptions about the number of goals one could reasonably make in one hour:

Assuming an average game length of 8 minutes (accounting for regulation time, replays, and queuing) and an average of 1.5 goals per game, we should expect an average of 7.5 games per hour * 1.5 goals per game = 11.25 goals per hour. I’ll round this to 11 to make the math relatively more simple.

Therefore, 11 goals per hour * 365 million hours (again, this is assuming 1 hour of play per day, every day, for 1 million years) = ~4 billion goals.

Now, according to a 2020 [article](https://www.pcgamer.com/rocket-league-players-have-scored-29-billion-goals/) posted by PCGamer.com, there had been approximately 29 billion total goals made by Rocket League players since the game’s release. Since this is a few years old, let’s assume approximately 50 billion total goals across the entirety of the Rocket League player base have been made to-date.

This means that the probability of this goal occurring is 1 in 50 billion (also assuming this goal has never been made before, which maybe it has - who knows). That is, every 50 billion goals, we’d expect the OP’s goal to occur 1 time.

Therefore, the probability that the OP could hit this goal again (with one hour per day, every day, for 1 million years) would be 4 billion / 50 billion = 0.08 = 8%

While small, this is still far from 0.

I don’t claim this is a perfect estimate, but it seems reasonable enough assuming an improbably long life expectancy.

Also my head hurts. I should probably do something with my day now. 😅
                        > Fair, I apologize for the tone in my previous comment.

Oh not at all. In fact it's funny that you mention tone, because I thought mine was a bit rude in my response. I love debating stuff, and it's rare you get to do it with everyone staying polite.

It seems to me that you have taken your original argument and fleshed it out with more detail, but the fundamental reasoning is the same.

I think the fact that this event has happened, doesn't help us in any way determine its likelihood of occurrence.

But perhaps I'll expand on my original argument with some absurdism in order to illustrate the framing that I think get's us closer to an answer.

OP said that his controller 'died'. Now this could mean that his batteries were low, or it could mean that the Bluetooth service on his PC failed for some reason. For argument's sake, let's exclude battery failure as the culprit (I say this knowing full-well that battery failure was most likely the cause for his controller dying). Let's say that Bluetooth on Windows PC is ridiculously robust. Let's say that Bluetooth fails only once for every 1,000,000 hours of use. Now let's say that OP here only plays for one hour a year... just one hour on his birthday and that's it. For this argument, OP is also immortal. Now, we know that his controller should fail only once over the next million years, *and none of the other elements are guaranteed to be present*. So if we take the 'Bluetooth failure' variable and increase its likelihood of occurring, we can double, triple, or multiply by it 1,000,000. And if we increase OP's time played per year by a thousand hours, we increase the total number of possible starting conditions. But this *still* doesn't ensure that OP's controller will fail within a second of him touching the ball on kickoff... nor are the are the other laundry-list of conditions necessarily present.

I think attempting to estimate the probability of:

(controllerFailure)\*(kickoffCondition)\*(properSpeed)\*(properAngle)\*(unobstructedPathToWall)\*(ballPassedToOP)\*(OP'sTouchPutsBallOnTarget)\*(ballEntersNetWithoutBeingSaved)\*(ballEntersNetWithoutBeingTouchedByTeammate)

...gets us a number that would be very, *very* small... and might be unlikely to happen in a million years.
                            I’ll concede that hitting this *exact* shot is probably unlikely, but even with all variables accounted for, something in my gut tells me a million years should be more than enough to hit something at least somewhat comparable - as well as a host of other whacky clip-worthy shots. It just feels like far too much time for it *not* to happen. That said, rigorously quantifying the odds might take even longer. 😂 Thanks for indulging in this ridiculous thought experiment with me. I’d like to think we have collectively added something - what that something is idk - but something to the greater body of Rocket League knowledge and lore. 🤝
                                lol absolutely! Thank you as well! One last note on our intuitions; if OP had instead said: “I started setting my controller down right after kickoff just for fun! Now that this has happened I think I’ll do it every time!” I wouldn’t be defending the ‘million year’ claim at all. My entire argument really hinges on what I think is a very rare occurrence, matched with a very specific time that it must occur. 

Good talking to you!
                                    I love this.
                Some dipshit killjoy downvoted this whole thread; can we get these two gentlemen's karma back to where it should be?
This is Rocket League! Nice shot... I think? Does it count still if Jesus takes the wheel?
    this is..jesus’s wheel?
    Jesus is pretty good at RL, apparently.
What a play! lol that was awesome
This is Rocket League!
Opposing players in my rank up games be like...

LMAO awesome clip!
That was sick lol
Might be the nuttiest clip I’ve seen on this sub. Calculated.
just better tbh
Okay this is actually so sick lmaooo
This might be my new favorite post on this sub
This has gotta be one of the best shots ive ever seen on this sub lmao
Fucking awesome
lmfao that's ridiculous
That tm8 rn…
    My redirect actually got us the goal because they were gonna save it. If you watch close you can see the guy ready for the save.
        No I wasn’t saying that you stole his goal I am just saying about his instant surprise in how you positioned yourself perfectly in order to hit the insane redirect.
            Gotcha gotcha. Thanks bro
Replay must have looked hilarious
yo 🤣 that’s pretty nutty.

“rOcKeT lEaGuE iS sO hArD”

(it is)
This is the greatest thing to ever happen in rocket league... no one will change my mind.
Just your luck
That was fuckin wild
That’s crazy! Go buy yourself a lotto ticket sir
How did he flip over if the controller died? Should have landed on the roof of the car!!!
    He got bumped
        Where
            Right when he touches the ball at the end after he comes off the ceiling
                Look again. No one near him
                    How are you guys this blind.  He gets bumped into the ball.  How tf do you not see that.
                The bump would never roll you over that perfectly... He got control exactly the moment he  hits the ball, you would be blind to not see it...
                    i literally just reviewed the clip because i noticed that the first time around as well, the ball bumps the car about 45-60 deg, then the ground rolls the car over the rest of the way.  


...you would have to be kind of stupid to assume that the ball didn't cause the rollover (In other words, don't be a dick)
    The 3rd player.
OMG! Holy cow that was funny :D
Nice
Every good pass is just a missed shot
lmaoooo that is never gonna be recreated again cuz its so lucky
Go buy yourself a lottery ticket asap
Amazing shot! That reminds me of my save that I got [in this clip](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/s/Iszyl87vOC)
New afk strat dropped
This fucking game
Looks like you’re better when not playing bud… lol kidding killer lucky clip loved it.
This is like the DVD logo hitting the direct corner of the TV.
    but even rarer
Amazing!
That’s crazy

Hahaha hell yea! Right place right time x100!
i would buy a lottery ticket after this, holy
Holy shit lol
ive seen a lot of clips. this ones crazy
Legendary
Everyone in the lobby must’ve been so bamboozled by that shot.
That was the most ridiculous accidental read and redirect I’ve ever seen.
Hahaha its funny to think that you wouldn't have done that if you were actually trying to pull it off
I will start disconnecting my controller after every kickoff.
How the…
Legendary
High IQ
You also made a nice pass to your corner/ teammate off the kickoff which started an insane passing play to ceiling shot with a dead controller. Crazy...
This is the best goal I've ever seen, bar none.
Is this Fortnite?
    No this is Patrick
        Hahahahaha
Wow thats the sickest RL clip I’ve seen
What's the opposite of "skill issue" this is insane
    Skill excess.
Top 5 sub Reddit clip fr
Bro this was incredible to watch
The prophecy is true
This has to be the luckiest shot in RL history lamoooo
Wow this is incredible
I’ve been playing Rocket league since 2015 and sarpbc before that and this is the best thing I’ve ever seen
Funny part is, if you had control over the car you probably wouldn’t have hit that shot lol
if my controller disconnected id probably just end up scoring it in my own goal somehow lol
Sensational.
This may be the greatest goal of all time... in all of gaming ... ever... 

maybe not - but it's top 5 for sure
I do better when im not paying attention sometimes 

Im not joking
lol, that was great.
Holy cow!

No way!

This is Rocket League!
Hit the casino. We have ourselves a winner.
Woah, r/rocketleague on r/all! Now that's a nice christmas present
I just imagine you being all stressed and pissed bc ur controller died and then you see this happening, instant happiness
    I didn't even know what happened because I was scrambling to get the controller plugged in. Had to watch the replay after the game
        Lol, even better, how suprised must you have been
Has u/sledge98 seen this yet?
Jesus take the wheel
How?

people still use wireless controllers ?
The day I learnt how to pass """
Funny goal, but this coulda been 15s long
Amazing, but why tf did I have to watch 20 seconds of an unrelated boring goal to get to it?

Why are people always doing this to me? Just crop your goddamn videos to the interesting part.
    Showing when the controller died
        Still a bit too much.
I reckon u might’ve even got more upvotes if u cut out more at the start, ya know- attention spans…
        The title already told me your controller died.

Did you think I wouldn't actually believe you unless you showed it working before or something?
You also stole that man’s great goal
    Looks like it would have been saved w/out the redirect.
Of course rocket league players dont know how to edit a video...
    I was showing where the controller died dude chill
        Just a joke from my end
nice but this clip didnt need to be so long.
    Oh come on, you wasted more time typing this comment than watching the first goal.
“My controller died”
Continues to do shit after the goal and in the victory screen. 
You’re the worst
    No clue what you're talking about
I can’t believe people still play this game
    I can't believe you still come to this subreddit if you don't play the game
        i reckon you hit /all with this many upvotes
            I'm a reddit newbie idk how to do that lol or is it just something that happens?
                if a post gets popular enough it will get to /all or /popular or whatever it's called now. so this user was likely commenting from there. still a rather useless comment regardless of that fact but maybe they're having a bad day.
Lmao this is unreal.
That is absolutely hilarious 😂

Had a very calculated moment recently to which someone in the other team said “That’s RL as fuck”…..but I believe you may have it beat. This is peak RL
    I had a similar clip to this that I posted a while back! Same story, batteries died and Jesus took the wheel lol. It was a save though, not a goal. 

I’m not trying to steal OPs spotlight, because that is very much deserved. I already had mine😂

[Here is the clip if you’re interested!](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/s/Iszyl87vOC)
        What a save! Lol yes it counts
What a pass!
Go play the lottery right now
This Is Rocket League!
Maybe the craziest thing ever
When my controller dies, my teamate just lets up goals
This is actually crazy😆😆
Lmao this has gotta be the subreddit’s best shot of the year
That's the most hilarious thing I have seen in this game XD
Oh my goodness!
No freakin way
Holy shit that’s nuts. Actually peaked when you weren’t even playing.
That’s fucking awesome!
Wow!

Dang need to join justice league with that sort of play.
This right here is why people think this game is rigged lol. The odds….
Calculated!
😂😂😂😂 that was great!
😭😭
Wow that’s legit.

I can’t even take ceiling shots if I tried… 🥲
How are you psychos so good at this game???
The assist was a dime too
LMFAOO this is the literal definition of less is more in this game
Looked to me like it was going to go in anyway, before you touched it again.
I get that it’s an amazing happenstance, but the ball would have gone in regardless?
    It wouldn't have though there was a defender in position to make the save.
    Watch one more time
        Oh, so the red was going to block it but he blocked the red car from blocking it?
            That kind of made it better but the shot is like a one in a million anyway
                Oh yeah definitely, the fact his controller went dead and managed to hit the ball again at all is insane.
Top left too. Good shot even without the controller shenanigans.
I mean, thats pretty much how rocket league works. When you stop hitting every goddam button for the sake of it, you start to actually control the car.

Nice gol.
I giggled
What are the fuckin odds
Lmao wtf
Incredible.
actually the best clip I've seen here in years. are you actually kidding me what are the chances
Reminds me of [this](https://youtu.be/UylSAK0wsiU?t=505) old clip of someone playing RL for the first time and hitting a similar shot while falling off the ceiling on accident. I remember that blowing my mind when I first saw it
That’s ‘Sick!’
So good it’s sickening 😁
That's insane

Don’t the gas stops too when your controller dies ?
 why do you keep the seconds before the first goal in but not the replay of the actual goal
Is dropshot back yet?
Savage
No way!
THIS. IS. ROCKET. LEAGUE!
What a save!
This is actually insane
That is actually insane
Since the latest update my Xbox controller on PC dies. Happens in the first minute or so of my first match. After unplugging the controller and plugging it in it works fine the rest of the matches. Anyone else has this problem?
Lmaoao
Another episode of clips that could’ve been 14 seconds shorter. Still a nice shot though.
But wasn't the ball gonna go in anyways?!?
    It actually wasn't. There is a defender there ready to save it
        All the more impressive then.
Everthing is planned.
 That’s amazing. Thanks for sharing this gem.
Let go and let god
That’s amazing

That’s crazy fair play bro
No way bro, lol
This is Rocket league
That was... not impressive, but legitimately, it's a miracle.  The amount of luck involved is ridiculous.  Good on you.
Nah this is insane. 

Man just casually hits some people's career goals with the controller disconnected. LMFAO
DUDE SERIOUSLY. lmaooooooooo I would call this fake if nameplates weren't on and they weren't already dominating, but to get TWO hits (notice his controller died right when he got the first hit) in, one in midair as a pass and into GOAL falling from driving with 0 boost *during a match*.

                    As someone that actually has it, I find it hilarious.
                        Cool! As someone who also is on the spectrum, I don’t! This whole normalization of “is he acoustic” and “maybe he has the tism” could really be done without, and many of my autistic friends also feel the same! So maybe default to not doing it, just like we’ve strayed away from calling people retarded.
                            Agreed despite them possibly being right. No one should be assumed to have a disorder just because they show weird behavior while excited or stressed. (but they may be right. regardless, what are the chances of this clip, I mean come on!)?
                    You say this as if there are other morally acceptable times to call a non-autistic person autistic lol
                        That’s not at all what I said, but okay. My take is just don’t call people autistic, don’t call people retarded, just don’t. Is that clear enough for you?
                            It's not what you said, it's the funny implications that could reasonably be misinterpreted by what you said. I'm just saying it was funny is all lol.
                                Got it, my bad then!
                    I literally have autism…
                        I literally do to, and I’m asking you to maybe not normalize this :) wild that this is a big ask.
                            Alright guys let’s wrap up the autism competition. Congrats you all won.
                                There’s a competition? Now I have to go min/max my autistic traits, thanks a LOT
                                Was not intended to be one. Just frustrating when someone uses that as a “since I have it and I’m okay with it, it must mean everyone is ok with it!” I’ve no intent of ill will, it’s just something that is better left unsaid.
                                Ha, that gave me a good laugh
                                Take my upvote sir
                            as someone who doesn't have the 'tism, i find it hilarious. 

therefore, the jokes are allowed. thanks!
    this is the energy everyone needs. i can vibe with you unlike all these other comments
        Thanks bruv.
    Controller died on kickoff
        He made a flip tho, so THREE times then?!
Me when the homie shows me his balls after telling me a joke
Yeah, and he didn't show the replay which I wanted to see
    I wasn't recording. This is a saved replay unfortunately.
        It’s called editing the clip
            Many people are tech illiterate
            It’s called in-game replays don’t show up in saved replays
                It’s called editing it after the fact? It’s not that hard.
                    My brother in Christ
                    How the fuck is he gonna edit the replay into the video
                        Dude you’re fucking dense. I’m just saying cut off the first 16 seconds of this video.

>	Why not just start the clip from the kickoff?
                            Most people are taking your comment as you saying you can show the replay of the goal (you know the one where the scorers anthem plays and the players have to skip it in game, that one.) just by editing the saved replay which removes those goal replays completely
                                damn, i guess most people are stupid then
                            I know what you’re saying but that’s irrelevant to the comment he was replying to.
                                WDYM??? It’s not in any way. U just can’t admit ur wrong now
                                You can make your own replay in the saved replays. Do another angle of your own making. It's not that hard.
                        Not that that's the point, but a freestyler was literally caught doing that. It's pretty easy. You can alter car/ball positions and velocities and then have the game simulate your desired replay.
His keyboard died while editing
    Underrated.
I was kind of just showing the exact point when the controller died 😂
    I think we would've understood given the caption and the clip 😁 if this happens again, name the kickoff strat "Playing Opossum"
        He actually hit it twice, once right when controller died, but he still could have shortened it a bit.
Statistically, you’re almost certainly wrong.
    Statistically, he’d be long dead by then therefore OP is almost certainly correct. 

Two can play at that game
        Touché.
        Statistically it only took him up to 8 years (less depending on when he started playing).

        How to sound stupid!   
By: Average redditor
    depending on how many times his battery dies in game with an input on, i'd say he's quite right
edit: unless you mean it would be less likely
    I disagree. The ‘same’ shot would be defined as:

A goal made after hitting the ball initially, his controller then dying within 1 second after his initial touch, his car then driving up the wall without being bumped off its path by another player, the ball then being passed toward his car, his car then falling on it in order to cause it to be sent into net without it being blocked by someone from the opposing team, and without it being touched by another player on his own team.

That’s a *lot* of conditions to be satisfied. The two main factors that dramatically affect the likelihood of it happening within 1 million years are:

1. The probability of his controller ‘dying’. 

How often does his controller lose its connection relative to the time it operates without issue? 

2. The frequency of play. 

If he plays Rocket League once a year for an hour, you are most certainly wrong. If he plays 16 hours a day, every day, you may be right.
        Nah you’re almost certainly still wrong. Even with just an hour a day, every day, for one million years, would yield ~365 million playable hours (~42,000 playable years) in which to hit this shot. 

Considering this game has been out for ~10 years and OP hit this shot within this time frame, we can estimate the probability of such a shot occurring as 1 in every 10 years (or 4,200 times in every 42,000 years). This corresponds to a probability of 0.1 shots every 1 year. 

Therefore, the probability of the shot NOT occurring again after 42,000 years is approximately (1 - 0.1)^42,000 which is *extremely* close to zero. If the probability of something NOT occurring is essentially zero, then it is essentially guaranteed that it WILL happen.

Q.E.D.
            > Considering this game has been out for ~10 years and OP hit this shot within this time frame, we can estimate the probability of such a shot occurring as 1 in every 10 years (or 4,200 times in every 42,000 years). This corresponds to a probability of 0.1 shots every 1 year. 

This is remarkably-bad reasoning. This would be like saying that because someone won the lottery after playing for 10 years, that we could expect them to hit the lottery every 10 years.

The fact that a single event has occurred, tells us *nothing* about its likelihood of occurring.
                Fair, I apologize for the tone in my previous comment. As soon as I posted it I realized something was off and have been trying to find a way to rephrase it, but you responded before I had a chance to tweak the logic.

Let’s make some rough assumptions about the number of goals one could reasonably make in one hour:

Assuming an average game length of 8 minutes (accounting for regulation time, replays, and queuing) and an average of 1.5 goals per game, we should expect an average of 7.5 games per hour * 1.5 goals per game = 11.25 goals per hour. I’ll round this to 11 to make the math relatively more simple.

Therefore, 11 goals per hour * 365 million hours (again, this is assuming 1 hour of play per day, every day, for 1 million years) = ~4 billion goals.

Now, according to a 2020 [article](https://www.pcgamer.com/rocket-league-players-have-scored-29-billion-goals/) posted by PCGamer.com, there had been approximately 29 billion total goals made by Rocket League players since the game’s release. Since this is a few years old, let’s assume approximately 50 billion total goals across the entirety of the Rocket League player base have been made to-date.

This means that the probability of this goal occurring is 1 in 50 billion (also assuming this goal has never been made before, which maybe it has - who knows). That is, every 50 billion goals, we’d expect the OP’s goal to occur 1 time.

Therefore, the probability that the OP could hit this goal again (with one hour per day, every day, for 1 million years) would be 4 billion / 50 billion = 0.08 = 8%

While small, this is still far from 0.

I don’t claim this is a perfect estimate, but it seems reasonable enough assuming an improbably long life expectancy.

Also my head hurts. I should probably do something with my day now. 😅
                    > Fair, I apologize for the tone in my previous comment.

Oh not at all. In fact it's funny that you mention tone, because I thought mine was a bit rude in my response. I love debating stuff, and it's rare you get to do it with everyone staying polite.

It seems to me that you have taken your original argument and fleshed it out with more detail, but the fundamental reasoning is the same.

I think the fact that this event has happened, doesn't help us in any way determine its likelihood of occurrence.

But perhaps I'll expand on my original argument with some absurdism in order to illustrate the framing that I think get's us closer to an answer.

OP said that his controller 'died'. Now this could mean that his batteries were low, or it could mean that the Bluetooth service on his PC failed for some reason. For argument's sake, let's exclude battery failure as the culprit (I say this knowing full-well that battery failure was most likely the cause for his controller dying). Let's say that Bluetooth on Windows PC is ridiculously robust. Let's say that Bluetooth fails only once for every 1,000,000 hours of use. Now let's say that OP here only plays for one hour a year... just one hour on his birthday and that's it. For this argument, OP is also immortal. Now, we know that his controller should fail only once over the next million years, *and none of the other elements are guaranteed to be present*. So if we take the 'Bluetooth failure' variable and increase its likelihood of occurring, we can double, triple, or multiply by it 1,000,000. And if we increase OP's time played per year by a thousand hours, we increase the total number of possible starting conditions. But this *still* doesn't ensure that OP's controller will fail within a second of him touching the ball on kickoff... nor are the are the other laundry-list of conditions necessarily present.

I think attempting to estimate the probability of:

(controllerFailure)\*(kickoffCondition)\*(properSpeed)\*(properAngle)\*(unobstructedPathToWall)\*(ballPassedToOP)\*(OP'sTouchPutsBallOnTarget)\*(ballEntersNetWithoutBeingSaved)\*(ballEntersNetWithoutBeingTouchedByTeammate)

...gets us a number that would be very, *very* small... and might be unlikely to happen in a million years.
                        I’ll concede that hitting this *exact* shot is probably unlikely, but even with all variables accounted for, something in my gut tells me a million years should be more than enough to hit something at least somewhat comparable - as well as a host of other whacky clip-worthy shots. It just feels like far too much time for it *not* to happen. That said, rigorously quantifying the odds might take even longer. 😂 Thanks for indulging in this ridiculous thought experiment with me. I’d like to think we have collectively added something - what that something is idk - but something to the greater body of Rocket League knowledge and lore. 🤝
                            lol absolutely! Thank you as well! One last note on our intuitions; if OP had instead said: “I started setting my controller down right after kickoff just for fun! Now that this has happened I think I’ll do it every time!” I wouldn’t be defending the ‘million year’ claim at all. My entire argument really hinges on what I think is a very rare occurrence, matched with a very specific time that it must occur. 

Good talking to you!
                                I love this.
            Some dipshit killjoy downvoted this whole thread; can we get these two gentlemen's karma back to where it should be?
this is..jesus’s wheel?
Jesus is pretty good at RL, apparently.
My redirect actually got us the goal because they were gonna save it. If you watch close you can see the guy ready for the save.
    No I wasn’t saying that you stole his goal I am just saying about his instant surprise in how you positioned yourself perfectly in order to hit the insane redirect.
        Gotcha gotcha. Thanks bro
He got bumped
    Where
        Right when he touches the ball at the end after he comes off the ceiling
            Look again. No one near him
                How are you guys this blind.  He gets bumped into the ball.  How tf do you not see that.
            The bump would never roll you over that perfectly... He got control exactly the moment he  hits the ball, you would be blind to not see it...
                i literally just reviewed the clip because i noticed that the first time around as well, the ball bumps the car about 45-60 deg, then the ground rolls the car over the rest of the way.  


...you would have to be kind of stupid to assume that the ball didn't cause the rollover (In other words, don't be a dick)
The 3rd player.
but even rarer
No this is Patrick
    Hahahahaha
Skill excess.
I didn't even know what happened because I was scrambling to get the controller plugged in. Had to watch the replay after the game
    Lol, even better, how suprised must you have been
Showing when the controller died
    Still a bit too much.
I reckon u might’ve even got more upvotes if u cut out more at the start, ya know- attention spans…
    The title already told me your controller died.

Did you think I wouldn't actually believe you unless you showed it working before or something?
Looks like it would have been saved w/out the redirect.
I was showing where the controller died dude chill
    Just a joke from my end
Oh come on, you wasted more time typing this comment than watching the first goal.
No clue what you're talking about
I can't believe you still come to this subreddit if you don't play the game
    i reckon you hit /all with this many upvotes
        I'm a reddit newbie idk how to do that lol or is it just something that happens?
            if a post gets popular enough it will get to /all or /popular or whatever it's called now. so this user was likely commenting from there. still a rather useless comment regardless of that fact but maybe they're having a bad day.
I had a similar clip to this that I posted a while back! Same story, batteries died and Jesus took the wheel lol. It was a save though, not a goal. 

I’m not trying to steal OPs spotlight, because that is very much deserved. I already had mine😂

[Here is the clip if you’re interested!](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/s/Iszyl87vOC)
    What a save! Lol yes it counts
It wouldn't have though there was a defender in position to make the save.
Watch one more time
    Oh, so the red was going to block it but he blocked the red car from blocking it?
        That kind of made it better but the shot is like a one in a million anyway
            Oh yeah definitely, the fact his controller went dead and managed to hit the ball again at all is insane.
It actually wasn't. There is a defender there ready to save it
    All the more impressive then.
I genuinely love your enthusiasm
    Thanks for being happy with me, by the way, even if people want to make it weird. 🖤 forgot to reply to the most important comment with all the commotion.
        r/humansbeingfriends  
:D
    Smells like satire
        It was true, I mean what are the chances you touch the ball twice and score driving perfectly straight with no boost lmao its so hilarious
        [removed]
            Why yes, if I may
            bruh....ok maybe, actually. l 

edit: Sorry, I have no idea what I was saying here. I had to put my phone away. probably that I may be on the spectrum idk.
            Yo, let’s not just call people autistic for simply getting enthusiastic about shit maybe? Really not cool for people who actually have it. Thanks!

But this *still* doesn't ensure that OP's controller will fail within a second of him touching the ball on kickoff... nor are the are the other laundry-list of conditions necessarily present.

I think attempting to estimate the probability of:

(controllerFailure)\*(kickoffCondition)\*(properSpeed)\*(properAngle)\*(unobstructedPathToWall)\*(ballPassedToOP)\*(OP'sTouchPutsBallOnTarget)\*(ballEntersNetWithoutBeingSaved)\*(ballEntersNetWithoutBeingTouchedByTeammate)

...gets us a number that would be very, *very* small... and might be unlikely to happen in a million years.
                    I’ll concede that hitting this *exact* shot is probably unlikely, but even with all variables accounted for, something in my gut tells me a million years should be more than enough to hit something at least somewhat comparable - as well as a host of other whacky clip-worthy shots. It just feels like far too much time for it *not* to happen. That said, rigorously quantifying the odds might take even longer. 😂 Thanks for indulging in this ridiculous thought experiment with me. I’d like to think we have collectively added something - what that something is idk - but something to the greater body of Rocket League knowledge and lore. 🤝
                        lol absolutely! Thank you as well! One last note on our intuitions; if OP had instead said: “I started setting my controller down right after kickoff just for fun! Now that this has happened I think I’ll do it every time!” I wouldn’t be defending the ‘million year’ claim at all. My entire argument really hinges on what I think is a very rare occurrence, matched with a very specific time that it must occur. 

Good talking to you!
                            I love this.
        Some dipshit killjoy downvoted this whole thread; can we get these two gentlemen's karma back to where it should be?
No I wasn’t saying that you stole his goal I am just saying about his instant surprise in how you positioned yourself perfectly in order to hit the insane redirect.
    Gotcha gotcha. Thanks bro
Where
    Right when he touches the ball at the end after he comes off the ceiling
        Look again. No one near him
            How are you guys this blind.  He gets bumped into the ball.  How tf do you not see that.
        The bump would never roll you over that perfectly... He got control exactly the moment he  hits the ball, you would be blind to not see it...
            i literally just reviewed the clip because i noticed that the first time around as well, the ball bumps the car about 45-60 deg, then the ground rolls the car over the rest of the way.  


...you would have to be kind of stupid to assume that the ball didn't cause the rollover (In other words, don't be a dick)
Hahahahaha
Lol, even better, how suprised must you have been
Still a bit too much.
I reckon u might’ve even got more upvotes if u cut out more at the start, ya know- attention spans…
The title already told me your controller died.

Did you think I wouldn't actually believe you unless you showed it working before or something?
Just a joke from my end
i reckon you hit /all with this many upvotes
    I'm a reddit newbie idk how to do that lol or is it just something that happens?
        if a post gets popular enough it will get to /all or /popular or whatever it's called now. so this user was likely commenting from there. still a rather useless comment regardless of that fact but maybe they're having a bad day.
What a save! Lol yes it counts
Oh, so the red was going to block it but he blocked the red car from blocking it?
    That kind of made it better but the shot is like a one in a million anyway
        Oh yeah definitely, the fact his controller went dead and managed to hit the ball again at all is insane.
All the more impressive then.
Thanks for being happy with me, by the way, even if people want to make it weird. 🖤 forgot to reply to the most important comment with all the commotion.
    r/humansbeingfriends  
:D
Smells like satire
    It was true, I mean what are the chances you touch the ball twice and score driving perfectly straight with no boost lmao its so hilarious
    [removed]
        Why yes, if I may
        bruh....ok maybe, actually. l 

edit: Sorry, I have no idea what I was saying here. I had to put my phone away. probably that I may be on the spectrum idk.
        Yo, let’s not just call people autistic for simply getting enthusiastic about shit maybe? Really not cool for people who actually have it. Thanks!
            As someone that actually has it, I find it hilarious.
                Cool! As someone who also is on the spectrum, I don’t! This whole normalization of “is he acoustic” and “maybe he has the tism” could really be done without, and many of my autistic friends also feel the same! So maybe default to not doing it, just like we’ve strayed away from calling people retarded.
                    Agreed despite them possibly being right. No one should be assumed to have a disorder just because they show weird behavior while excited or stressed. (but they may be right. regardless, what are the chances of this clip, I mean come on!)?
            You say this as if there are other morally acceptable times to call a non-autistic person autistic lol
                That’s not at all what I said, but okay. My take is just don’t call people autistic, don’t call people retarded, just don’t. Is that clear enough for you?
                    It's not what you said, it's the funny implications that could reasonably be misinterpreted by what you said. I'm just saying it was funny is all lol.
                        Got it, my bad then!
            I literally have autism…
                I literally do to, and I’m asking you to maybe not normalize this :) wild that this is a big ask.
                    Alright guys let’s wrap up the autism competition. Congrats you all won.
                        There’s a competition? Now I have to go min/max my autistic traits, thanks a LOT
                        Was not intended to be one. Just frustrating when someone uses that as a “since I have it and I’m okay with it, it must mean everyone is ok with it!” I’ve no intent of ill will, it’s just something that is better left unsaid.
                        Ha, that gave me a good laugh
                        Take my upvote sir
                    as someone who doesn't have the 'tism, i find it hilarious. 

therefore, the jokes are allowed. thanks!
Thanks bruv.
He made a flip tho, so THREE times then?!
It’s called editing the clip
    Many people are tech illiterate
    It’s called in-game replays don’t show up in saved replays
        It’s called editing it after the fact? It’s not that hard.
            My brother in Christ
            How the fuck is he gonna edit the replay into the video
                Dude you’re fucking dense. I’m just saying cut off the first 16 seconds of this video.

>	Why not just start the clip from the kickoff?
                    Most people are taking your comment as you saying you can show the replay of the goal (you know the one where the scorers anthem plays and the players have to skip it in game, that one.) just by editing the saved replay which removes those goal replays completely
                        damn, i guess most people are stupid then
                    I know what you’re saying but that’s irrelevant to the comment he was replying to.
                        WDYM??? It’s not in any way. U just can’t admit ur wrong now
                        You can make your own replay in the saved replays. Do another angle of your own making. It's not that hard.
                Not that that's the point, but a freestyler was literally caught doing that. It's pretty easy. You can alter car/ball positions and velocities and then have the game simulate your desired replay.
He actually hit it twice, once right when controller died, but he still could have shortened it a bit.
Touché.
Statistically it only took him up to 8 years (less depending on when he started playing).
He's the top bureaucrat. Don't quote him regulations!
How to sound stupid!   
By: Average redditor
Nah you’re almost certainly still wrong. Even with just an hour a day, every day, for one million years, would yield ~365 million playable hours (~42,000 playable years) in which to hit this shot. 

Considering this game has been out for ~10 years and OP hit this shot within this time frame, we can estimate the probability of such a shot occurring as 1 in every 10 years (or 4,200 times in every 42,000 years). This corresponds to a probability of 0.1 shots every 1 year. 

Therefore, the probability of the shot NOT occurring again after 42,000 years is approximately (1 - 0.1)^42,000 which is *extremely* close to zero. If the probability of something NOT occurring is essentially zero, then it is essentially guaranteed that it WILL happen.

Q.E.D.
    > Considering this game has been out for ~10 years and OP hit this shot within this time frame, we can estimate the probability of such a shot occurring as 1 in every 10 years (or 4,200 times in every 42,000 years). This corresponds to a probability of 0.1 shots every 1 year. 

This is remarkably-bad reasoning. This would be like saying that because someone won the lottery after playing for 10 years, that we could expect them to hit the lottery every 10 years.

The fact that a single event has occurred, tells us *nothing* about its likelihood of occurring.
        Fair, I apologize for the tone in my previous comment. As soon as I posted it I realized something was off and have been trying to find a way to rephrase it, but you responded before I had a chance to tweak the logic.

Let’s make some rough assumptions about the number of goals one could reasonably make in one hour:

Assuming an average game length of 8 minutes (accounting for regulation time, replays, and queuing) and an average of 1.5 goals per game, we should expect an average of 7.5 games per hour * 1.5 goals per game = 11.25 goals per hour. I’ll round this to 11 to make the math relatively more simple.

Therefore, 11 goals per hour * 365 million hours (again, this is assuming 1 hour of play per day, every day, for 1 million years) = ~4 billion goals.

Now, according to a 2020 [article](https://www.pcgamer.com/rocket-league-players-have-scored-29-billion-goals/) posted by PCGamer.com, there had been approximately 29 billion total goals made by Rocket League players since the game’s release. Since this is a few years old, let’s assume approximately 50 billion total goals across the entirety of the Rocket League player base have been made to-date.

This means that the probability of this goal occurring is 1 in 50 billion (also assuming this goal has never been made before, which maybe it has - who knows). That is, every 50 billion goals, we’d expect the OP’s goal to occur 1 time.

Therefore, the probability that the OP could hit this goal again (with one hour per day, every day, for 1 million years) would be 4 billion / 50 billion = 0.08 = 8%

While small, this is still far from 0.

I don’t claim this is a perfect estimate, but it seems reasonable enough assuming an improbably long life expectancy.

Also my head hurts. I should probably do something with my day now. 😅
            > Fair, I apologize for the tone in my previous comment.

Oh not at all. In fact it's funny that you mention tone, because I thought mine was a bit rude in my response. I love debating stuff, and it's rare you get to do it with everyone staying polite.

It seems to me that you have taken your original argument and fleshed it out with more detail, but the fundamental reasoning is the same.

I think the fact that this event has happened, doesn't help us in any way determine its likelihood of occurrence.

But perhaps I'll expand on my original argument with some absurdism in order to illustrate the framing that I think get's us closer to an answer.

OP said that his controller 'died'. Now this could mean that his batteries were low, or it could mean that the Bluetooth service on his PC failed for some reason. For argument's sake, let's exclude battery failure as the culprit (I say this knowing full-well that battery failure was most likely the cause for his controller dying). Let's say that Bluetooth on Windows PC is ridiculously robust. Let's say that Bluetooth fails only once for every 1,000,000 hours of use. Now let's say that OP here only plays for one hour a year... just one hour on his birthday and that's it. For this argument, OP is also immortal. Now, we know that his controller should fail only once over the next million years, *and none of the other elements are guaranteed to be present*. So if we take the 'Bluetooth failure' variable and increase its likelihood of occurring, we can double, triple, or multiply by it 1,000,000. And if we increase OP's time played per year by a thousand hours, we increase the total number of possible starting conditions. But this *still* doesn't ensure that OP's controller will fail within a second of him touching the ball on kickoff... nor are the are the other laundry-list of conditions necessarily present.

(controllerFailure)\*(kickoffCondition)\*(properSpeed)\*(properAngle)\*(unobstructedPathToWall)\*(ballPassedToOP)\*(OP'sTouchPutsBallOnTarget)\*(ballEntersNetWithoutBeingSaved)\*(ballEntersNetWithoutBeingTouchedByTeammate)

                Was not intended to be one. Just frustrating when someone uses that as a “since I have it and I’m okay with it, it must mean everyone is ok with it!” I’ve no intent of ill will, it’s just something that is better left unsaid.
                Ha, that gave me a good laugh
                Take my upvote sir
            as someone who doesn't have the 'tism, i find it hilarious. 

therefore, the jokes are allowed. thanks!
It’s called editing it after the fact? It’s not that hard.

    How the fuck is he gonna edit the replay into the video
        Dude you’re fucking dense. I’m just saying cut off the first 16 seconds of this video.

>	Why not just start the clip from the kickoff?
            Most people are taking your comment as you saying you can show the replay of the goal (you know the one where the scorers anthem plays and the players have to skip it in game, that one.) just by editing the saved replay which removes those goal replays completely
                damn, i guess most people are stupid then
            I know what you’re saying but that’s irrelevant to the comment he was replying to.
                WDYM??? It’s not in any way. U just can’t admit ur wrong now
                You can make your own replay in the saved replays. Do another angle of your own making. It's not that hard.
        Not that that's the point, but a freestyler was literally caught doing that. It's pretty easy. You can alter car/ball positions and velocities and then have the game simulate your desired replay.
Fair, I apologize for the tone in my previous comment. As soon as I posted it I realized something was off and have been trying to find a way to rephrase it, but you responded before I had a chance to tweak the logic.

Let’s make some rough assumptions about the number of goals one could reasonably make in one hour:

Assuming an average game length of 8 minutes (accounting for regulation time, replays, and queuing) and an average of 1.5 goals per game, we should expect an average of 7.5 games per hour * 1.5 goals per game = 11.25 goals per hour. I’ll round this to 11 to make the math relatively more simple.

Therefore, 11 goals per hour * 365 million hours (again, this is assuming 1 hour of play per day, every day, for 1 million years) = ~4 billion goals.

Now, according to a 2020 [article](https://www.pcgamer.com/rocket-league-players-have-scored-29-billion-goals/) posted by PCGamer.com, there had been approximately 29 billion total goals made by Rocket League players since the game’s release. Since this is a few years old, let’s assume approximately 50 billion total goals across the entirety of the Rocket League player base have been made to-date.

This means that the probability of this goal occurring is 1 in 50 billion (also assuming this goal has never been made before, which maybe it has - who knows). That is, every 50 billion goals, we’d expect the OP’s goal to occur 1 time.

Therefore, the probability that the OP could hit this goal again (with one hour per day, every day, for 1 million years) would be 4 billion / 50 billion = 0.08 = 8%

While small, this is still far from 0.

I don’t claim this is a perfect estimate, but it seems reasonable enough assuming an improbably long life expectancy.

Also my head hurts. I should probably do something with my day now. 😅
    > Fair, I apologize for the tone in my previous comment.

Oh not at all. In fact it's funny that you mention tone, because I thought mine was a bit rude in my response. I love debating stuff, and it's rare you get to do it with everyone staying polite.

It seems to me that you have taken your original argument and fleshed it out with more detail, but the fundamental reasoning is the same.

I think the fact that this event has happened, doesn't help us in any way determine its likelihood of occurrence.

But perhaps I'll expand on my original argument with some absurdism in order to illustrate the framing that I think get's us closer to an answer.

OP said that his controller 'died'. Now this could mean that his batteries were low, or it could mean that the Bluetooth service on his PC failed for some reason. For argument's sake, let's exclude battery failure as the culprit (I say this knowing full-well that battery failure was most likely the cause for his controller dying). Let's say that Bluetooth on Windows PC is ridiculously robust. Let's say that Bluetooth fails only once for every 1,000,000 hours of use. Now let's say that OP here only plays for one hour a year... just one hour on his birthday and that's it. For this argument, OP is also immortal. Now, we know that his controller should fail only once over the next million years, *and none of the other elements are guaranteed to be present*. So if we take the 'Bluetooth failure' variable and increase its likelihood of occurring, we can double, triple, or multiply by it 1,000,000. And if we increase OP's time played per year by a thousand hours, we increase the total number of possible starting conditions. But this *still* doesn't ensure that OP's controller will fail within a second of him touching the ball on kickoff... nor are the are the other laundry-list of conditions necessarily present.

I think attempting to estimate the probability of:

(controllerFailure)\*(kickoffCondition)\*(properSpeed)\*(properAngle)\*(unobstructedPathToWall)\*(ballPassedToOP)\*(OP'sTouchPutsBallOnTarget)\*(ballEntersNetWithoutBeingSaved)\*(ballEntersNetWithoutBeingTouchedByTeammate)

...gets us a number that would be very, *very* small... and might be unlikely to happen in a million years.
        I’ll concede that hitting this *exact* shot is probably unlikely, but even with all variables accounted for, something in my gut tells me a million years should be more than enough to hit something at least somewhat comparable - as well as a host of other whacky clip-worthy shots. It just feels like far too much time for it *not* to happen. That said, rigorously quantifying the odds might take even longer. 😂 Thanks for indulging in this ridiculous thought experiment with me. I’d like to think we have collectively added something - what that something is idk - but something to the greater body of Rocket League knowledge and lore. 🤝
            lol absolutely! Thank you as well! One last note on our intuitions; if OP had instead said: “I started setting my controller down right after kickoff just for fun! Now that this has happened I think I’ll do it every time!” I wouldn’t be defending the ‘million year’ claim at all. My entire argument really hinges on what I think is a very rare occurrence, matched with a very specific time that it must occur. 

Good talking to you!
                I love this.
How are you guys this blind.  He gets bumped into the ball.  How tf do you not see that.
i literally just reviewed the clip because i noticed that the first time around as well, the ball bumps the car about 45-60 deg, then the ground rolls the car over the rest of the way.  


...you would have to be kind of stupid to assume that the ball didn't cause the rollover (In other words, don't be a dick)
As someone that actually has it, I find it hilarious.
    Cool! As someone who also is on the spectrum, I don’t! This whole normalization of “is he acoustic” and “maybe he has the tism” could really be done without, and many of my autistic friends also feel the same! So maybe default to not doing it, just like we’ve strayed away from calling people retarded.
        Agreed despite them possibly being right. No one should be assumed to have a disorder just because they show weird behavior while excited or stressed. (but they may be right. regardless, what are the chances of this clip, I mean come on!)?
You say this as if there are other morally acceptable times to call a non-autistic person autistic lol
    That’s not at all what I said, but okay. My take is just don’t call people autistic, don’t call people retarded, just don’t. Is that clear enough for you?
        It's not what you said, it's the funny implications that could reasonably be misinterpreted by what you said. I'm just saying it was funny is all lol.
            Got it, my bad then!
I literally have autism…
    I literally do to, and I’m asking you to maybe not normalize this :) wild that this is a big ask.
        Alright guys let’s wrap up the autism competition. Congrats you all won.
            There’s a competition? Now I have to go min/max my autistic traits, thanks a LOT
