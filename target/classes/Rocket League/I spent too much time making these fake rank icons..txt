                Why'd you even have that tho
                    [deleted]
                        Not to be that guy, but nazi stuff isn't joking material. Nowadays you really don't know who's saying dumb shit for laughs or for real. Just the other day I was playing bfv and some dude with a nordic myth name started to spew nazi shit and white supremacy links, never know when it's for real. 


Besides the fact that nazis were shitheads who killed millions. Idk. My thoughts.


Edit: man, didn't expect people would get triggered over this, lol
                            I don't disagree, Joking about something like the holocaust is something I certainly would never do, or laugh over. However I don't necessarily have a problem with jokes about the Third Reich in general. Same with other countries.

Basically "" was only an expression used by the Nazis to express victory and it doesn't show how bad they really were by raising a right hand 60 degrees up

Nevertheless I understand your concern. Trust me, White supremacists, (Neo-)Nazis would be a lot more obvious to spot by how obnoxious they are, and I hate them as much as you.
                                Yeah I understand. It wasn't something as fucked like a holocaust joke or smth but still, that deleted comment responding to mine up top was a dickwad repeating that shit. So, yk... People have to guess wether whoever wrote that is edgy, an asshole, or a nazi so... Yeah. Gave you the benefit of the doubt and I'm glad you feel the way you do. There are some rotten folks out there.
                            Joking about any dark subject can be considered "not joking mateial" for different people depending on their sense of humour. There's no right or wrong with dark humour - the scale of darkness that is acceptable entirely depends on how parties take dark jokes. 

Because of this I agree that it was quite silly of him to have a flair with that in a public subreddit where loads of people will see it - he has no idea who will be offended and who will find it funny, so it's dangerous to assume everyone will find it funny.

But also, it's important to understand that not everyone has the same sense of humour! Dark humour makes fun of these terrible things, and whilst I understand this crosses the line for some people, for others, it is acceptable and this DOES NOT MEAN THEY ARE SICK PEOPLE WITH CRAZY BELIEFS. Last part is important, some people seem to believe that if you laugh at nazi jokes, find films like Borat funny, then you are somehow a horrid person - no.
                                There's a difference between joking about it in person, with people that know you're joking, and doing it on the internet where intent is extremely hard to judge. This is especially true when joking about extremist beliefs like neo Nazi ideology, nationalist fascism, sexism, racism, etc because people use the internet as a safe place to share these ideas and try to find like minded individuals. 

And unfortunately people are highly impressionable. If you see enough comments extolling white supremecy, it plants seeds. Some or even most of those comments may be jokes, but again it's hard to tell and the jokers could end up having a hand in solidifying the beliefs of a person who is starting to tend towards extremism. 

It's perfectly fine and normal to have a dark sense of humor. But the internet generally isn't a great place for casual dark humor especially when the humor centers around extremist political ideologies the people actually believe in.
                                    Very good point. When you reach a large audience you don't know who's reading what you're writing and how they'll take that in
                                Oh yeah I understand. Places like truestl and chapotraphouse (rip) made some really fucked up jokes sometimes, but it was understood anything written there, wasn't forreal (doubly so for TrueSTL). Still, /r/rocketleague is kept pretty clean and aside from the occasional joke you don't really expect to come here for humor. Context, yk. 


I don't really get the really edgy humor (yk like big mouth or some of the fucked up rick and morty jokes) but I understand why someone could find em funny. I dont mean to say that people who make edgy jokes are assholes, it just depends on how aware the person telling the joke is of who might hear/read it (and obvious really heinous stuff that absolutely should not be joked about, like slavery, holocaust, famine, etc., but that should go w/o saying).
                                    Big mouth and rick and morty are edgy to you?
                            *Proceeds to be that guy*
                            Thank you joke police

                                    WHOA you know the secret code too?? I've never seen someone else who knew it before 

But seriously you know absolutely no context to that guy's joke but still decided to start the virtue signaling early huh. I probably wouldn't make a joke like that myself but telling someone else not to without any context is ridiculous.
                            The Nazis are so bad that the guy who killed Hitler is actually my hero!
                            Is this a copy pasta?
                            Everything is joking material, with the correct build up and punch line. You can't go around being sensitive on the internet.

        What the fuck is up with the dog water insult, it’s so dumb.
            My buddy and I sarcastically call people goat water or other animal water when people call us dog water, pretty funny
                nice.
            Yea my dogs drink filtered tap
                My dog's don't even really drink it out of a bowl they have a little water fountain
                Wait I thought this was referencing hot dog water? Like gross bad meat flavored water left behind when you boil hotdogs
            It’s a new “trend”
        I’m just waste 😂
        Have you considered relocating to a new city? Business is booming here!
        According to my teammates I'm "I f ucked your mom last night."
        Apparently I'm Uninstall I
        I'm casual 1. I'm not even allowed in ranked.

        link to comment?
        It’s good to stay off sino/genzedong etc to keep your sanity. It’s also good to stay off PCM, but that’s not as big of a worry.
    Wait until you hit Rubbish 3.  
That's the real shit.
        Bro Rubbish 3 is so toxic tho
    So would champ be dumpster and grandchamp be dumpster juice
        SSL is Landfill.
    I'm turd rank 1, not even worth being called garbage.
        [deleted]
            Aw dude! I loved that film. :D I think I even still have it on DVD.
    I would easily be Trash 1 if I didn't keep getting paired with terrible teammates. I swear most of them should really be Dogshit 2 or lower.
    I'm tinfoil 3 rn
    I just passed Trash 3 and now I'm at Dumpster 1, it's tough in here
    I’ve been described as the “Platinum 2 of Own Goaling” so let me know if you need any tips, I’m sure I can help you make the next step!
    Lucky! Im still at "your trash kid uninstall the game" III.
    I’m aiming for recycle 1 this season.
    Nice! I’m hoping to push into Trash Ass 2 myself!
    Garbage 3? You gotta take those black bags and dump into the trash, one level at a time, before your sorry ass will be situated firmly in the Trash 3 tank.
    I'm "delet game now plz" IV
    Dumpster Fire is top tier stuff guys
    Lucky, I’m still at Shit 2
        Just keep on doing your worst and you'll get there🍻
    Garbage, Trash,  dumpster,  dumpster fire.
    I audibly laughed at this
    thinking we need a black trash bag as garbage rank
    i barely ever have played rocket league but this thread makes me wanna do it even less
    Nice Shot!

Great Pass!
    bruh I'm stuck at dust getting to trash is gonna take some commitment
Ah finally the rank I deserve
    I played three hours of 1v1 yesterday and was so bad I genuinely considered deranking to gold 1 or smth to match my skill level
        We all have those days man, just turn the game off for a few days and play when you feel like you miss it. Helps me to enjoy the game more and not think so much about winning and losing. Surprisingly, I play better as well.
            Yeah it's insane how some days I can barely score open goals and some days I feel like an unstoppable God
                yeah its so annoying tho, when i feel like i wanna play im garbage, but when i open it up out of boredom im godlike
                I noticed this tendency as well, and it largely relies on if its a weekend/peaktime part of the week(like evenings etc) or when the grinders be playing who play more serious and are more matching with the rank they are playing in. someone can have a time when plays the game real frequent, gets better, goes all the way up to lets say dia 3 then misses out on playing, becomes a bit inconsistent, and in dia being inconsistent with things like clears/passes can cost you matches etc and if you get those players as oppositions you win easier but if you get them as mates, you need to do more work
            I just power through the pain and tank my rank because I know the next time I come online I can kick some ass
            So true, that’s why I come back it’s so much fun ! When ur not worried about losing....
            Happy to see I’m not the only one who can feel once like god and some days after like a pile a garbage
        1s are way harder for me at least, I'm not good mechanically so I can't really dribble and make a lot of solo goals. Last time I played 1s was when I was dia 2 and I got gold 3 in my 1s placement.
    I am not even Trash 3

    Yo can u tell me the font u used plss. I've been looking for the exact same font which u used for a long time.
        I believe Rocket League uses the *Bourgeois* fonts for most of written stuff
            Oh OK.

Edit: Yes it is Bourgeois
            commies take another L
            Ya and GoGo Poster Punch for the logo
        My previous reply didn't appear for some reason, but yeah it's Bourgeois
            Ahhh so it was a problem of reddit then. Anyways thanks man. Appreciate ur work.
        I found it on an old thread from this subreddit. It's called Bourgeois
    Sick, will use them definitely :) thx man
        No problem! I can disable the outer glow if you need it
            Would probably work better for me but you don’t have to go through the effort. Can you also dm me your socials or something were I can shout you out? Or are you only on reddit?
                The no glow versions are on the album now
                Ok, I'll edit it later then. And yeah I'm only on reddit.
    finally i can show my true rank on this sub
    That's awesome, but to be fair I think that it would look better for trash 2 to be symmetric, so one line on the left, no middle and one on the right. Great job !
        I've tried that, and it looks weird for me. Then I took a peek at the diamond icons and said "f it I'll just do it that way"
            Your choice was aesthetically correct with the rest of the rank symbols. Personally, I find it nice that you can differentiate the ranks easily when they're small just by the single negative space. But that's just the graphic designer in me. Congrats on such a successful design, well deserved.
        I agree, and maybe with Trash I centered.
    100% I could see Sizz or Rizzo or someone in that orbit using this. Good stuff.
    They look great man! Did you make them with Illustrator?
        Yes
    Make grand trash. Like grand plat.
    You BET I'll use them. If I ever finish a game.
    I'm not involved with this community, but graphic design is my passion. Wouldn't it be better-looking and more symmetrical like this:   
Trash 1 |\_|\_|   
Trash 2 | |_| |   
Trash 3 | | | | |  
Like, have the first bar in the middle, the second two on the edges.
        Maybe but it matches with the real other rank icons when.its like this
        It’s not symmetric because other rank icons aren’t either. It’s just being consistent.
            Ah, ok. As I said, don't know this community.
                That’s fine mate, just wanted to explain why it looks ”weird”

Hey /u/sanikfast,


This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
    what the hell
        True. Opened on all and this was first

Nice one!
        Siiick!
        r/gaming is a weird community that mostly upvotes Imgur style posts, but could be worth trying to cross post this there because the subject matter applies to other video games with ranking systems.
        true
I need these as user flairs.

Edit: Well boys we did it.
    [deleted]
        Let's goo
        Hell yeah
Finally a rank I feel like I belong
    Hundreds of hours of play and I still do the same dumb shit. 

Clear path to the ball with a wide open net?

Better boost like a maniac so I lose all steering finesse and boom the ball 30 feet off-target
        Bro this made me laugh. I’m glad I’m not the only one😂😂
I'm only trash 2. Any tips to help me get to trash 3?
    Always boost. Constantly. Never stop accelerating. That way you'll be fast and reach the ball before anyone else.
    Set your camera so that you only see a small tunnel with the ball. Only use ball cam. Always go for tge ball. Good thing you just changed your camera setting and won't get bothered by your teammate as you don't see them. When they're right in front of you, just bump them away. Go for solo plays that end up i passing the ball to the opponent.

Oh, and be toxic. It motivates your teammate.
        You forgot, always make sure your camera shake is on.
            Put your PC or console on top of a heater to get Cinematic™ mode, where it drops to 24 or lower fps. Burning through hardware is just the price for the pursuit of perfection
                Jokes aside, would that actually do anything on console? My ps4 is in a very awkward position, so it always gets very hot when playing afternoon, but I never noticed a frame drop
        spoken like a true diamond
    Fill your bin
    Basically stay away from your teammates bc if you dont the ball will fly over your head, also if you miss the ball just drive away back to net bc you can get in the way of your tm8 who is already flying at the ball
And the title you get ist S3 Trash Master
    If u spelt that right it woulda been funnier
        I swear the letter just changed. I hit S
        Lol says the moron who typed “u”
            That was my first thought. How are you going to correct somebody's typing when you use shorthand u?
Next april fools they should replace every rank other than SSL with these. It would be pretty funny.
    SSL: Super Sanitation Legend
Im Grand trash 2 pretty solid imo.
Wow. Top post on all. Deep down we are all made of the same trash.
This should be given to smurfs and the game should make them play against each other for 1 week
    Add people who abandon ranked games.
        Depending on the person most people abandon ranked games because their wifi goes down.
            I’m skeptical, I just queued into 2s and my rando and I got two kickoff goals and one of the opponents left after he missed the save leaving the other dude to play for a minute and a half alone. Don’t be that person people.
            Is it coincidence that their wifi goes down right after their team conceded a goal?
    [removed]
        Do you just throw every game?

I mean at some point the players might get so bad you have to stop them from own-goaling.
            Actually you’re right hahaha some of them are not even comparable to bots. They look like they *just* picked up the game and it’s their first time holding a controller.

Sometimes I mess up with them a bit before forfeiting, but most of the time I just forfeit
        Wait its possible to have negative MMR?
[deleted]
Fake? I've been in these ranks for years
    Same
Why you gotta do like that, iam at legit bronze...! :(
    You have the most fun tho, no toxic shits in bronze
        Nope there is, 4/10 of my games in Bronze 3/Silver 1 either say "EZZZZZZZZ" or "Delete the game." or at least something along these lines, I've also been called a few rather... racist terms as well.
            Bruh, fr? Thats bs you are a bronze/silver you are basically the lowest players, 90% of all players will absolutely destroy you, thats so stupid, being toxic in silver
                Good thing about matchmaking systems is that they're competitive at any level. Aside from the top pros in SSL, there's no such thing as absolute skill in RL, just relative skill compared to the players you happen to get matched with.

Bad thing about that is it means there's always someone to compare yourself to, and players who have a really, deeply insecure ego are going to do that *constantly*.

>!Good thing about *that*, though, is that [I find it really really funny to get under their skin, win or lose](https://i.imgur.com/gQ97eNt.png)!<
                    Yea but i mean like just in general, they are very low skilled players so you shouldnt shittalk bc you arent the best
            I would love to play some games there, losing anything on purpose and if they start trashtalking just crush them.
                Smurf?
                    Is it smurfing tho if you only punish toxic people?
                        It's smurfing for a just cause
                        I have a smurf (so my rank doesnt get obliterated when playing with friends) but if you start a new account you start as a bronze so its easy to get in bronze
When you learn that GC is actually "Garbage Can"
Your design is garbage (in a good way)
And you get a steam award for demoing someone with this rank; "Taking out the trash!"
So are you worse if you're on trash 1 or trash 3?
    Exactly, almost thought nobody is asking the important questions. 

My take is that it just goes below Bronze, so trash 1 is the worst.
Like a green plat
    Yes
Grand Trashmaster
Trash  
Traash  
Traaash
This is where you should get sent for toxic or racist behaviour instead of 24hr ban
Graphic design grad here.. Never made a career out of it and just do it as a hobby now.

Can you elaborate on how you achieved the double gradient? I attempted making one of these and that gave me the most grief.. Yours turned out sick by the way!

Most people never understand the drive to spend way too long on something for others to just say 'Cool' haha but I will tell you these came out dope 😎
    I don't really understand what you meant by double gradient, but if you want to know how I made it see my reply [here](https://reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/nspn9o/i_spent_too_much_time_making_these_fake_rank_icons/h0omqgr/)

Edit: seems like the link is broken
        Oh like there's a gradient/glow effect on the bottom left corner of the bin, and a diagonal cut across the middle, and another gradient towards the top right. I was having trouble achieving that effect on my design :) thanks for the reply
Finally I'm the best at something
    1v1 me bro, guarantee I'm more trash
        Well well well, I finally met someone that might pose a challenge for my shitty dribbling skills, I don't even know what it means. Our battle will be legendary!
The question remains, is Trash III better or worse?
Finally the flair i needed
In trash 4 can tipped over on its side
Community ranks!! Like in other games, ppl can give you a title/rank/property after a match. Yeah… definetly would not get out of hand
Maybe I could finally win a tournament...
trash 4 should be the lid open with the trash dude from the Muppets
    Oscar the grouch, perhaps?
Bro I just got to trash II what are u gonna do?
Huh, I feel like a lot of my random teammates have these already. Are you sure you just made them?
some of my teammates think im this rank and just keep the ball away form me XD (great icon design btw)
I think you have too much time on your hands! You might wanna use it more wisely! Keep in mind... TIME is your worst enemy!!!
[deleted]
    I can share the raw file later, but essentially at first I tried to remake the diamond 1 icon, to get how thick the lines should be. Then I just make the basic garbage shape with that same thickness, while keeping in mind how the 2nd and 3rd icon would be different on the outside. Then, I set up a gradient fill from the bottom left to top right (I think it's 60 degree from the horizontal line), going from normal green -> dark green -> normal green -> almost white bright yellow. Then I set up a rectangle with super dark green gradient fading from the edge and rotate it and mask it to the shape to make the reflection thingy. Then I copy the main shape and put it above and set up a white inner glow with color dodge blend mode. Lastly, I give it an outer glow to better match the official icons. I hope this is helpful!
    [removed]
I got inspired and tried to recreate the style :D https://i.imgur.com/kATiOr9.png

I'm not a graphics guy but I think I got quite close. Your icons look great btw :)
Damn and I thought my wood 2 is bad
I love these way too much. Great job op!!
Thank you. I'll use it with pride!
THEY MADE IT INTO FLAIRS LMAOO
Trash 3 div 4 I’m almost out guys, almost 😂
I feel like it’d be opposite, or negatives, that trash 1 is better than trash 3
I didn't know they re-did the logos for platinum
Nice
Just out of curiosity: is trash 3 "better" than trash 1? Or are you "more trash" then?
I made a Telegram Sticker Pack with these icons:

https://t.me/addstickers/RLTrash
Psyonix please make this a thing, i'm sick of people thinking i'm platinum.
Beautiful
Your graphic made it into this Sunless Khan video right at 37 seconds. You are famous! [https://youtu.be/sNqU1tddlK4?t=35](https://youtu.be/sNqU1tddlK4?t=35)
    Oh nice, thanks for informing me man
I can't be the only person who instantly sent this to my friends lol.
Finally a rank that reflects my skill level!
Yeah well your drawings are trash.

EDIT: Wow everyone's pun detection is off today.
    k
        It was a dry humor joke, I'm assuming. Its Literally a drawing of trash cans, so it would be correct to say the drawings are trash, because that's what they are a drawing of, containers of trash.
            Pretty sure OP got it
    You dont like how it's designed your rank?
How wow they added a new rank above curry lll nice
I could sacrifice my silver for this colour of a rank
[deleted]
i fucked your mom 3 div 4
Im trash 2.6
Fake ?
That would be great as an april fools joke
I'm gonna have a Word page open with the link to this so I can "show my teammate something" next time :)
These should be the only ranks from diamond and below
    are you trying to say I have transcended being trash? I'll have you know that I whiff more shots than a bronze and open nets are my greatest enemy.
    SSL and below*
    Nah, I'm still trash.
I love it 😆
time well spent! :D
Wait, that's my rank!
Guess it’s for bad sport players
Wow. It looks cool for noobs
TrashCan't 1
>Trash 2
>>TrashCan 3
This is funny, imma save this one
Dumpster fire 2 👍
Yes
This i need! Someday you just want to give it up and grab your Title de Trash 🏆
I'm plastic 2
That’s pretty brilliant, well done.
Mods please add this to the subreddit flairs?
Finally, a worthy rank for me
This is the best thing I've seen today, and the best thing I will see today.
Finally i belong somewhere
This is Gold.
Why can't my teammates say TM8 UR GRAND CHAMPION II
this is a gem
Brilliant
These are amazing but you gotta use some of the suggested ones to make a full suite of ranks up to SSL now!
Perfect for us trash taste connoisseurs
Does this mean that at Trash III you're worse than at Trash I?
These need to be added as flairs for this sub
How do I add these to my flare?
These have to become flairs on this sub
Bruh I told you to not show my face in your fanart :(
Wait, that's my rank! Can we please have it at least as Reddit flyer?
I am Dumpster III, hoping to get Trash 1 soon
I'm at piece of crap -1, hope to at least get to garbage I by the next 5 seasons
Every plat ever
This should be a flair lolll
Came out pretty well
That's awesome.

And too accurate
Yesterday I FINALLY reached back ally dumpster 2, hope I can reach trash 1 soon!!
NICE
Fucking love this 😁
Hahaha that’s pretty good! I would rock that if I could.
Should be the rank you have to get out of when you’re a toxic player
Fake icons? Pretty sure I have the rewards for trash rank
That's Ranking for random teammates
NEXT APRIL FOOLS PLEASEEE
Is there a radioactive waste 0 rank? Cause that’s how I feel. About to uninstall.
wow hope i reach those ranks soon
Yes lol
Do they go backwards?  Like, the worse you are the higher your trash rank?
Those ranks are reserved for people who enable "wow!" And "#!$#" to their chat and use them exclusively from the first second of a match they are losing
Ah yes, finally, the rank toxic players should have
So much surprised Rose
Platinum rank I see
It looks great, but maybe you could arrange it so that it follows the more traditional rules of rank symbols. Meaning, the bars being arranged centered and not "progressing" from left to right.
It should be backwards, I guess
I would love to see those ranks haha (eventhough I could be hard stuck in them)
Would be hilarious if someone made a bakkesmod plug in that changes all the ranked icons & names in game to these like the April fools option 😂
Wich rank is higher? Trash 1 or trash 3?
I’m on please uninstall 2 hoping to get to trash soon
[deleted]
Im useless 3 trying to make it to dog shit 1
I’m trash 2 division3 and hope to get trash 3 soon
I wish I could start here. I'm peeking at Plat 2. It's frustrating to me that I get hate messages about how bad I am, when I already know I'm bad. And if you really feel the need to message me then do some self reflection. I'm bad, and we're the same skill rank, so what does that make you?
god damn finally my teammates can have a suiting rank

- every single player in CASUAL 3v3
After ranking up from trash 3, then we get the dogshit rank
change every single rank
Oh god, i probably wouldnt even be able to get to trash 3..
What?! I’m still on dirt 2 you guys are too sweaty...
Ggg
Ahh, my fellow tribesmen. I await you all with open arms at the summit of this giant heap: 🗑 Grand Trashpion III
I hope this is the rank which replaces champ
Finally a Rank I can see myself fit in
Bronze.       Trash

Silver.          Garbage

Gold.           Braindead

Plat.             Grand Plat

Diamond.    Ballchaser

Champ.       Mediocre

Gc.               Meh...

Ssl.               Super Sonic Trash
I deserve trash III, and I'm not exaggerating, just watch me play and you might wanna make trash IV
Imagine your rank is trash 3 and you flexing on people who are they trash 1 😂
This is fake, it happens for real.
This should be the new Diamond replacement since half of the lobbies are just trash
I hope they do this for April fools in the future.
not relatable
Should be trash 1 trash 2 and trashcan
Is there some sort of bronze variant of trash 1 that could be applicable to me? Or maybe some lesser material like aluminium foil or cardboard?
Trash 1: kill a teammate 

Trash 2: lose 10 games

Trash 3: break a controller
Finally, a rank that describes me.
Something removed all the corners from my icons!
so who's the worst here? is trash III the worst of them all or is it trash I ?
These look like trash
Almost at Trash 2,wish me luck boys
I think I'm on trash 2
Why so i see them when i look at my rank 

(Btw they look fucking amazing!)
Psyonix plis
Im proud of my rank
Maybe someday I’ll reach such prestigious ranks...
I'm the tier below, stuck in diamond for about 3 years now.
According to my experience, I am a dog poo disgrace to humanity 1
Please let this be the level after GC
I am trash can 1 and i cant wait to teamed up with a trash can 3 so they can blame me for everything.
I guess next rank up from this is recycling since then your useful for something!
.
Xd new rank for ball cheaser
I think this rank could easily replace platinum and diamond tbh
Looks like trash 🗑 not gonna lie
It's trash
Nice
New platnium ranks?
Nice work.
10th Prestige
Are these able to be used across the platform?
I’m trash 2 I’d say
#ROCKETLEAGUE
I'm rolling on the floor laughing my ass off. These should be implemented under bronze so the toxic noobs know where they belong.
Tm8 got called a paper 3 by the other team, pain...
find me in the 3rd bin
When I’m on controller, give me trash 2
Nice
I'm trash in game too. Gg
Finally, a rank I can actually fit into properly...
Could you imagine everybody ranks changing to this on April's Fool
This is beautiful. Please telle you're a graphic designer. If not, maybe you should be.
Finally I feel represented
Worth it!
These fit right in between bronze and GC.
Lmao
Shoot take me straight to the landfill cause there no returning from how bad I am.
Should be the trash equivalent of SSL called trash can.
Now I can accurately display my skill on this sub
I need this in my life!
If I had the option, I’d wear it with pride
Not 2 brag but I ranked up to trash
 Trash II) Some people see the trash can as half full. Some see it as half empty.
Finally, the rank that I deserve
Ah yes the veteran tag
Is dog water above or below trash l
Most of the time people call me "trade?"

Not sure what that is
Shoulda filled up from bottom to top with the lines.  Opportunity missed.
I wanna suck more just to get these ranks. 😆
LFG
 Nice icons
why does trash 1 not have "legs" but the other 2 do?
Alr, time to change plat icons with bakkes mod and these incons
I need this!
Is compost heap higher or lower than trash I forget
Love it, I've been looking for flair that represents me as a player
gonna need verifiable proof that you're not a Psyonix graphic designer
Where are the Houston Astros? I think they might want to consider these
these are so cool!
Those are real ranks
I hope the next batch is a Dumpster during its various stages of flammability.
Those are for me!
Feels like 1 and 2 should be in centered / symmetrical.
Welp I guess I know what rank up to.
These ranks are awesome 😁😁😁
Grand trash can comes next.
Waste 1 for me
The toxicity of this game remains unmatched lmao
Test
So in between gold and plat?
Trash 3 looks like a shopping cart from a certain perspective
Totally worth it tho
Looks like it makes a good recycle bin skin even shows when it's full
I hope rl changes the rank icons like this for the next april fools.
What app and/or website did you use to make these?
How great, they added more leagues that I’ll never be able to reach. Oh well, I’ll stay stuck on the homescreen and cry
Best chin of all time?!
Lol
Next tier is landfill
Finally I can rank up by playing like shit
Is trash 3 better or worse than trash 1?
just changing my flair don’t mind me
this belongs to anyone below plat lmao
Oh yeah
I’ve never changed my flair before..... but now... I have no choice not to rep
Thanks for the flair amigo!
Thats quite the pog i must say
I wish I could create one. I want moth rank : _ (
Why would I use that when I have the champ 1 flair which serves the same purpose?
Nice
So do you think is spent in crazy mode
This should definitely go into the game lmao. I've actually seem people who were worse than the lowest rank a couple times.
What is this?
Lol
After a 6 lose streak, finally reached trash rank
People just call me bee bee sea liquid
Complete garbage at the game uninstall 2 div 4
Stuck in dumpster 3 pls give advice
No, you’ve just made ranks for half the player base
If it's an SVG please send it my way.
Don't mind me
It's dragon's lair:   1 is the nes version   2 is the snes version and the 3 is the gameboy version.
Can we get Plastic I, II, III next please? Thanks in advance
Sick!
Where's wood 1 wood 2 and wood 3?
Finally, a flair that suits me better than bronze
I like this.
if only the rank system started at 3 because then you can have the trash slowly emptying
These need to be quick chat options.
Y’all hit trash 3, I’m still wet napkin 2
U sir just made an amazing meme template
I definitely feel represented now thank you OP
bruh I'm still at dog water 2 according to my most recent teammate
    The boys around competitive call me... "Uninstall" 😎
        Well they call me "Suicide"

I'm honoured to receive such lengthy titles from my opponents.
                Yh I am at "Don't go for that you always miss 3 div 2" but I am improving! Hope I will reach "Teammate noob" before the season ends

                    You watch your mouth !
                    Me: Ur just…special.

Too collective Reddit: Special talents??

You know…you chase the ball, like…super fast. Always just behind the play.
                I bow to ye, oh titled one. May thou goals and team mates be nigh of perfection.
                They tell me that “it was a sad day for my mother when I slithered out of the abortion bucket”….
                My favorite thing i’ve ever been called was “trash bump kid”. 

As you might be able to guess, we won the match.
            They call me "i hope you die by canc*r!"

            they call me "Forfeiter"
        The call me " go back to fortnite "
            They call me "Go back to mario"
        I thought I was the only one.
        They call me ***. Who knows what that means.
    Bruh what's up with your flair?

Edit: for reference, guy had "sieg heil" there.
        fuck I forgot to change it back
            Why'd you even have that tho
                [deleted]
                    Not to be that guy, but nazi stuff isn't joking material. Nowadays you really don't know who's saying dumb shit for laughs or for real. Just the other day I was playing bfv and some dude with a nordic myth name started to spew nazi shit and white supremacy links, never know when it's for real. 


Besides the fact that nazis were shitheads who killed millions. Idk. My thoughts.


Edit: man, didn't expect people would get triggered over this, lol
                        I don't disagree, Joking about something like the holocaust is something I certainly would never do, or laugh over. However I don't necessarily have a problem with jokes about the Third Reich in general. Same with other countries.

Basically "" was only an expression used by the Nazis to express victory and it doesn't show how bad they really were by raising a right hand 60 degrees up

Nevertheless I understand your concern. Trust me, White supremacists, (Neo-)Nazis would be a lot more obvious to spot by how obnoxious they are, and I hate them as much as you.
                            Yeah I understand. It wasn't something as fucked like a holocaust joke or smth but still, that deleted comment responding to mine up top was a dickwad repeating that shit. So, yk... People have to guess wether whoever wrote that is edgy, an asshole, or a nazi so... Yeah. Gave you the benefit of the doubt and I'm glad you feel the way you do. There are some rotten folks out there.
                        Joking about any dark subject can be considered "not joking mateial" for different people depending on their sense of humour. There's no right or wrong with dark humour - the scale of darkness that is acceptable entirely depends on how parties take dark jokes. 

Because of this I agree that it was quite silly of him to have a flair with that in a public subreddit where loads of people will see it - he has no idea who will be offended and who will find it funny, so it's dangerous to assume everyone will find it funny.

But also, it's important to understand that not everyone has the same sense of humour! Dark humour makes fun of these terrible things, and whilst I understand this crosses the line for some people, for others, it is acceptable and this DOES NOT MEAN THEY ARE SICK PEOPLE WITH CRAZY BELIEFS. Last part is important, some people seem to believe that if you laugh at nazi jokes, find films like Borat funny, then you are somehow a horrid person - no.
                            There's a difference between joking about it in person, with people that know you're joking, and doing it on the internet where intent is extremely hard to judge. This is especially true when joking about extremist beliefs like neo Nazi ideology, nationalist fascism, sexism, racism, etc because people use the internet as a safe place to share these ideas and try to find like minded individuals. 

And unfortunately people are highly impressionable. If you see enough comments extolling white supremecy, it plants seeds. Some or even most of those comments may be jokes, but again it's hard to tell and the jokers could end up having a hand in solidifying the beliefs of a person who is starting to tend towards extremism. 

It's perfectly fine and normal to have a dark sense of humor. But the internet generally isn't a great place for casual dark humor especially when the humor centers around extremist political ideologies the people actually believe in.
                                Very good point. When you reach a large audience you don't know who's reading what you're writing and how they'll take that in
                            Oh yeah I understand. Places like truestl and chapotraphouse (rip) made some really fucked up jokes sometimes, but it was understood anything written there, wasn't forreal (doubly so for TrueSTL). Still, /r/rocketleague is kept pretty clean and aside from the occasional joke you don't really expect to come here for humor. Context, yk. 


I don't really get the really edgy humor (yk like big mouth or some of the fucked up rick and morty jokes) but I understand why someone could find em funny. I dont mean to say that people who make edgy jokes are assholes, it just depends on how aware the person telling the joke is of who might hear/read it (and obvious really heinous stuff that absolutely should not be joked about, like slavery, holocaust, famine, etc., but that should go w/o saying).
                                Big mouth and rick and morty are edgy to you?
                        *Proceeds to be that guy*
                        Thank you joke police
                            [removed]
                                WHOA you know the secret code too?? I've never seen someone else who knew it before 

But seriously you know absolutely no context to that guy's joke but still decided to start the virtue signaling early huh. I probably wouldn't make a joke like that myself but telling someone else not to without any context is ridiculous.
                        The Nazis are so bad that the guy who killed Hitler is actually my hero!
                        Is this a copy pasta?
                        Everything is joking material, with the correct build up and punch line. You can't go around being sensitive on the internet.

    What the fuck is up with the dog water insult, it’s so dumb.
        My buddy and I sarcastically call people goat water or other animal water when people call us dog water, pretty funny
            nice.
        Yea my dogs drink filtered tap
            My dog's don't even really drink it out of a bowl they have a little water fountain
            Wait I thought this was referencing hot dog water? Like gross bad meat flavored water left behind when you boil hotdogs
        It’s a new “trend”
    I’m just waste 😂
    Have you considered relocating to a new city? Business is booming here!
    According to my teammates I'm "I f ucked your mom last night."
    Apparently I'm Uninstall I
    I'm casual 1. I'm not even allowed in ranked.

    link to comment?
    It’s good to stay off sino/genzedong etc to keep your sanity. It’s also good to stay off PCM, but that’s not as big of a worry.
Wait until you hit Rubbish 3.  
That's the real shit.
    Bro Rubbish 3 is so toxic tho
So would champ be dumpster and grandchamp be dumpster juice
    SSL is Landfill.
I'm turd rank 1, not even worth being called garbage.
    [deleted]
        Aw dude! I loved that film. :D I think I even still have it on DVD.
I would easily be Trash 1 if I didn't keep getting paired with terrible teammates. I swear most of them should really be Dogshit 2 or lower.
I'm tinfoil 3 rn
I just passed Trash 3 and now I'm at Dumpster 1, it's tough in here
I’ve been described as the “Platinum 2 of Own Goaling” so let me know if you need any tips, I’m sure I can help you make the next step!
Lucky! Im still at "your trash kid uninstall the game" III.
I’m aiming for recycle 1 this season.
Nice! I’m hoping to push into Trash Ass 2 myself!
Garbage 3? You gotta take those black bags and dump into the trash, one level at a time, before your sorry ass will be situated firmly in the Trash 3 tank.
I'm "delet game now plz" IV
Dumpster Fire is top tier stuff guys
Lucky, I’m still at Shit 2
    Just keep on doing your worst and you'll get there🍻
Garbage, Trash,  dumpster,  dumpster fire.
I audibly laughed at this
thinking we need a black trash bag as garbage rank
i barely ever have played rocket league but this thread makes me wanna do it even less
Nice Shot!

Great Pass!
bruh I'm stuck at dust getting to trash is gonna take some commitment
I played three hours of 1v1 yesterday and was so bad I genuinely considered deranking to gold 1 or smth to match my skill level
    We all have those days man, just turn the game off for a few days and play when you feel like you miss it. Helps me to enjoy the game more and not think so much about winning and losing. Surprisingly, I play better as well.
        Yeah it's insane how some days I can barely score open goals and some days I feel like an unstoppable God
            yeah its so annoying tho, when i feel like i wanna play im garbage, but when i open it up out of boredom im godlike
            I noticed this tendency as well, and it largely relies on if its a weekend/peaktime part of the week(like evenings etc) or when the grinders be playing who play more serious and are more matching with the rank they are playing in. someone can have a time when plays the game real frequent, gets better, goes all the way up to lets say dia 3 then misses out on playing, becomes a bit inconsistent, and in dia being inconsistent with things like clears/passes can cost you matches etc and if you get those players as oppositions you win easier but if you get them as mates, you need to do more work
        I just power through the pain and tank my rank because I know the next time I come online I can kick some ass
        So true, that’s why I come back it’s so much fun ! When ur not worried about losing....
        Happy to see I’m not the only one who can feel once like god and some days after like a pile a garbage
    1s are way harder for me at least, I'm not good mechanically so I can't really dribble and make a lot of solo goals. Last time I played 1s was when I was dia 2 and I got gold 3 in my 1s placement.
I am not even Trash 3
Yo can u tell me the font u used plss. I've been looking for the exact same font which u used for a long time.
    I believe Rocket League uses the *Bourgeois* fonts for most of written stuff
        Oh OK.

Edit: Yes it is Bourgeois
        commies take another L
        Ya and GoGo Poster Punch for the logo
    My previous reply didn't appear for some reason, but yeah it's Bourgeois
        Ahhh so it was a problem of reddit then. Anyways thanks man. Appreciate ur work.
    I found it on an old thread from this subreddit. It's called Bourgeois
Sick, will use them definitely :) thx man
    No problem! I can disable the outer glow if you need it
        Would probably work better for me but you don’t have to go through the effort. Can you also dm me your socials or something were I can shout you out? Or are you only on reddit?
            The no glow versions are on the album now
            Ok, I'll edit it later then. And yeah I'm only on reddit.
finally i can show my true rank on this sub
That's awesome, but to be fair I think that it would look better for trash 2 to be symmetric, so one line on the left, no middle and one on the right. Great job !
    I've tried that, and it looks weird for me. Then I took a peek at the diamond icons and said "f it I'll just do it that way"
        Your choice was aesthetically correct with the rest of the rank symbols. Personally, I find it nice that you can differentiate the ranks easily when they're small just by the single negative space. But that's just the graphic designer in me. Congrats on such a successful design, well deserved.
    I agree, and maybe with Trash I centered.
100% I could see Sizz or Rizzo or someone in that orbit using this. Good stuff.
They look great man! Did you make them with Illustrator?
    Yes
Make grand trash. Like grand plat.
You BET I'll use them. If I ever finish a game.
I'm not involved with this community, but graphic design is my passion. Wouldn't it be better-looking and more symmetrical like this:   
Trash 1 |\_|\_|   
Trash 2 | |_| |   
Trash 3 | | | | |  
Like, have the first bar in the middle, the second two on the edges.
    Maybe but it matches with the real other rank icons when.its like this
    It’s not symmetric because other rank icons aren’t either. It’s just being consistent.
        Ah, ok. As I said, don't know this community.
            That’s fine mate, just wanted to explain why it looks ”weird”
what the hell
    True. Opened on all and this was first

Nice one!
    Siiick!
    r/gaming is a weird community that mostly upvotes Imgur style posts, but could be worth trying to cross post this there because the subject matter applies to other video games with ranking systems.
    true
[deleted]
    Let's goo
    Hell yeah
Hundreds of hours of play and I still do the same dumb shit. 

Clear path to the ball with a wide open net?

Better boost like a maniac so I lose all steering finesse and boom the ball 30 feet off-target
    Bro this made me laugh. I’m glad I’m not the only one😂😂
Always boost. Constantly. Never stop accelerating. That way you'll be fast and reach the ball before anyone else.
Set your camera so that you only see a small tunnel with the ball. Only use ball cam. Always go for tge ball. Good thing you just changed your camera setting and won't get bothered by your teammate as you don't see them. When they're right in front of you, just bump them away. Go for solo plays that end up i passing the ball to the opponent.

Oh, and be toxic. It motivates your teammate.
    You forgot, always make sure your camera shake is on.
        Put your PC or console on top of a heater to get Cinematic™ mode, where it drops to 24 or lower fps. Burning through hardware is just the price for the pursuit of perfection
            Jokes aside, would that actually do anything on console? My ps4 is in a very awkward position, so it always gets very hot when playing afternoon, but I never noticed a frame drop
    spoken like a true diamond
Fill your bin
Basically stay away from your teammates bc if you dont the ball will fly over your head, also if you miss the ball just drive away back to net bc you can get in the way of your tm8 who is already flying at the ball
If u spelt that right it woulda been funnier
    I swear the letter just changed. I hit S
    Lol says the moron who typed “u”
        That was my first thought. How are you going to correct somebody's typing when you use shorthand u?

Add people who abandon ranked games.
    Depending on the person most people abandon ranked games because their wifi goes down.
        I’m skeptical, I just queued into 2s and my rando and I got two kickoff goals and one of the opponents left after he missed the save leaving the other dude to play for a minute and a half alone. Don’t be that person people.
        Is it coincidence that their wifi goes down right after their team conceded a goal?
[removed]
    Do you just throw every game?

I mean at some point the players might get so bad you have to stop them from own-goaling.
        Actually you’re right hahaha some of them are not even comparable to bots. They look like they *just* picked up the game and it’s their first time holding a controller.

Sometimes I mess up with them a bit before forfeiting, but most of the time I just forfeit
    Wait its possible to have negative MMR?
Same
You have the most fun tho, no toxic shits in bronze
    Nope there is, 4/10 of my games in Bronze 3/Silver 1 either say "EZZZZZZZZ" or "Delete the game." or at least something along these lines, I've also been called a few rather... racist terms as well.
        Bruh, fr? Thats bs you are a bronze/silver you are basically the lowest players, 90% of all players will absolutely destroy you, thats so stupid, being toxic in silver
            Good thing about matchmaking systems is that they're competitive at any level. Aside from the top pros in SSL, there's no such thing as absolute skill in RL, just relative skill compared to the players you happen to get matched with.

Bad thing about that is it means there's always someone to compare yourself to, and players who have a really, deeply insecure ego are going to do that *constantly*.

>!Good thing about *that*, though, is that [I find it really really funny to get under their skin, win or lose](https://i.imgur.com/gQ97eNt.png)!<
                Yea but i mean like just in general, they are very low skilled players so you shouldnt shittalk bc you arent the best
        I would love to play some games there, losing anything on purpose and if they start trashtalking just crush them.
            Smurf?
                Is it smurfing tho if you only punish toxic people?
                    It's smurfing for a just cause
                    I have a smurf (so my rank doesnt get obliterated when playing with friends) but if you start a new account you start as a bronze so its easy to get in bronze
Exactly, almost thought nobody is asking the important questions. 

My take is that it just goes below Bronze, so trash 1 is the worst.
Yes
I don't really understand what you meant by double gradient, but if you want to know how I made it see my reply [here](https://reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/nspn9o/i_spent_too_much_time_making_these_fake_rank_icons/h0omqgr/)

Edit: seems like the link is broken
    Oh like there's a gradient/glow effect on the bottom left corner of the bin, and a diagonal cut across the middle, and another gradient towards the top right. I was having trouble achieving that effect on my design :) thanks for the reply
1v1 me bro, guarantee I'm more trash
    Well well well, I finally met someone that might pose a challenge for my shitty dribbling skills, I don't even know what it means. Our battle will be legendary!
Oscar the grouch, perhaps?
I can share the raw file later, but essentially at first I tried to remake the diamond 1 icon, to get how thick the lines should be. Then I just make the basic garbage shape with that same thickness, while keeping in mind how the 2nd and 3rd icon would be different on the outside. Then, I set up a gradient fill from the bottom left to top right (I think it's 60 degree from the horizontal line), going from normal green -> dark green -> normal green -> almost white bright yellow. Then I set up a rectangle with super dark green gradient fading from the edge and rotate it and mask it to the shape to make the reflection thingy. Then I copy the main shape and put it above and set up a white inner glow with color dodge blend mode. Lastly, I give it an outer glow to better match the official icons. I hope this is helpful!

Oh nice, thanks for informing me man

    It was a dry humor joke, I'm assuming. Its Literally a drawing of trash cans, so it would be correct to say the drawings are trash, because that's what they are a drawing of, containers of trash.

You dont like how it's designed your rank?
are you trying to say I have transcended being trash? I'll have you know that I whiff more shots than a bronze and open nets are my greatest enemy.

                Not to be that guy, but nazi stuff isn't joking material. Nowadays you really don't know who's saying dumb shit for laughs or for real. Just the other day I was playing bfv and some dude with a nordic myth name started to spew nazi shit and white supremacy links, never know when it's for real. 


Besides the fact that nazis were shitheads who killed millions. Idk. My thoughts.


Edit: man, didn't expect people would get triggered over this, lol
                    I don't disagree, Joking about something like the holocaust is something I certainly would never do, or laugh over. However I don't necessarily have a problem with jokes about the Third Reich in general. Same with other countries.

Basically "" was only an expression used by the Nazis to express victory and it doesn't show how bad they really were by raising a right hand 60 degrees up

Nevertheless I understand your concern. Trust me, White supremacists, (Neo-)Nazis would be a lot more obvious to spot by how obnoxious they are, and I hate them as much as you.
                        Yeah I understand. It wasn't something as fucked like a holocaust joke or smth but still, that deleted comment responding to mine up top was a dickwad repeating that shit. So, yk... People have to guess wether whoever wrote that is edgy, an asshole, or a nazi so... Yeah. Gave you the benefit of the doubt and I'm glad you feel the way you do. There are some rotten folks out there.
                    Joking about any dark subject can be considered "not joking mateial" for different people depending on their sense of humour. There's no right or wrong with dark humour - the scale of darkness that is acceptable entirely depends on how parties take dark jokes. 

Because of this I agree that it was quite silly of him to have a flair with that in a public subreddit where loads of people will see it - he has no idea who will be offended and who will find it funny, so it's dangerous to assume everyone will find it funny.

But also, it's important to understand that not everyone has the same sense of humour! Dark humour makes fun of these terrible things, and whilst I understand this crosses the line for some people, for others, it is acceptable and this DOES NOT MEAN THEY ARE SICK PEOPLE WITH CRAZY BELIEFS. Last part is important, some people seem to believe that if you laugh at nazi jokes, find films like Borat funny, then you are somehow a horrid person - no.
                        There's a difference between joking about it in person, with people that know you're joking, and doing it on the internet where intent is extremely hard to judge. This is especially true when joking about extremist beliefs like neo Nazi ideology, nationalist fascism, sexism, racism, etc because people use the internet as a safe place to share these ideas and try to find like minded individuals. 

And unfortunately people are highly impressionable. If you see enough comments extolling white supremecy, it plants seeds. Some or even most of those comments may be jokes, but again it's hard to tell and the jokers could end up having a hand in solidifying the beliefs of a person who is starting to tend towards extremism. 

It's perfectly fine and normal to have a dark sense of humor. But the internet generally isn't a great place for casual dark humor especially when the humor centers around extremist political ideologies the people actually believe in.
                            Very good point. When you reach a large audience you don't know who's reading what you're writing and how they'll take that in
                        Oh yeah I understand. Places like truestl and chapotraphouse (rip) made some really fucked up jokes sometimes, but it was understood anything written there, wasn't forreal (doubly so for TrueSTL). Still, /r/rocketleague is kept pretty clean and aside from the occasional joke you don't really expect to come here for humor. Context, yk. 


I don't really get the really edgy humor (yk like big mouth or some of the fucked up rick and morty jokes) but I understand why someone could find em funny. I dont mean to say that people who make edgy jokes are assholes, it just depends on how aware the person telling the joke is of who might hear/read it (and obvious really heinous stuff that absolutely should not be joked about, like slavery, holocaust, famine, etc., but that should go w/o saying).
                            Big mouth and rick and morty are edgy to you?
                    *Proceeds to be that guy*

But seriously you know absolutely no context to that guy's joke but still decided to start the virtue signaling early huh. I probably wouldn't make a joke like that myself but telling someone else not to without any context is ridiculous.
                    The Nazis are so bad that the guy who killed Hitler is actually my hero!
                    Is this a copy pasta?
                    Everything is joking material, with the correct build up and punch line. You can't go around being sensitive on the internet.

    Aw dude! I loved that film. :D I think I even still have it on DVD.
Just keep on doing your worst and you'll get there🍻
We all have those days man, just turn the game off for a few days and play when you feel like you miss it. Helps me to enjoy the game more and not think so much about winning and losing. Surprisingly, I play better as well.
    Yeah it's insane how some days I can barely score open goals and some days I feel like an unstoppable God
        yeah its so annoying tho, when i feel like i wanna play im garbage, but when i open it up out of boredom im godlike
        I noticed this tendency as well, and it largely relies on if its a weekend/peaktime part of the week(like evenings etc) or when the grinders be playing who play more serious and are more matching with the rank they are playing in. someone can have a time when plays the game real frequent, gets better, goes all the way up to lets say dia 3 then misses out on playing, becomes a bit inconsistent, and in dia being inconsistent with things like clears/passes can cost you matches etc and if you get those players as oppositions you win easier but if you get them as mates, you need to do more work
    I just power through the pain and tank my rank because I know the next time I come online I can kick some ass
    So true, that’s why I come back it’s so much fun ! When ur not worried about losing....
    Happy to see I’m not the only one who can feel once like god and some days after like a pile a garbage
1s are way harder for me at least, I'm not good mechanically so I can't really dribble and make a lot of solo goals. Last time I played 1s was when I was dia 2 and I got gold 3 in my 1s placement.

No problem! I can disable the outer glow if you need it
    Would probably work better for me but you don’t have to go through the effort. Can you also dm me your socials or something were I can shout you out? Or are you only on reddit?
        The no glow versions are on the album now
        Ok, I'll edit it later then. And yeah I'm only on reddit.
I've tried that, and it looks weird for me. Then I took a peek at the diamond icons and said "f it I'll just do it that way"
    Your choice was aesthetically correct with the rest of the rank symbols. Personally, I find it nice that you can differentiate the ranks easily when they're small just by the single negative space. But that's just the graphic designer in me. Congrats on such a successful design, well deserved.
I agree, and maybe with Trash I centered.
Yes
Maybe but it matches with the real other rank icons when.its like this
It’s not symmetric because other rank icons aren’t either. It’s just being consistent.
    Ah, ok. As I said, don't know this community.
        That’s fine mate, just wanted to explain why it looks ”weird”
True. Opened on all and this was first

                        WHOA you know the secret code too?? I've never seen someone else who knew it before 

But seriously you know absolutely no context to that guy's joke but still decided to start the virtue signaling early huh. I probably wouldn't make a joke like that myself but telling someone else not to without any context is ridiculous.
                The Nazis are so bad that the guy who killed Hitler is actually my hero!
                Is this a copy pasta?
                Everything is joking material, with the correct build up and punch line. You can't go around being sensitive on the internet.

            Nah. Fuck nazis.
                Tbf, getting laid is more of an accomplishment than I would manage in their position.
My buddy and I sarcastically call people goat water or other animal water when people call us dog water, pretty funny
    nice.
Yea my dogs drink filtered tap
    My dog's don't even really drink it out of a bowl they have a little water fountain
    Wait I thought this was referencing hot dog water? Like gross bad meat flavored water left behind when you boil hotdogs
It’s a new “trend”
Aw dude! I loved that film. :D I think I even still have it on DVD.
Yeah it's insane how some days I can barely score open goals and some days I feel like an unstoppable God
    yeah its so annoying tho, when i feel like i wanna play im garbage, but when i open it up out of boredom im godlike
    I noticed this tendency as well, and it largely relies on if its a weekend/peaktime part of the week(like evenings etc) or when the grinders be playing who play more serious and are more matching with the rank they are playing in. someone can have a time when plays the game real frequent, gets better, goes all the way up to lets say dia 3 then misses out on playing, becomes a bit inconsistent, and in dia being inconsistent with things like clears/passes can cost you matches etc and if you get those players as oppositions you win easier but if you get them as mates, you need to do more work
I just power through the pain and tank my rank because I know the next time I come online I can kick some ass
So true, that’s why I come back it’s so much fun ! When ur not worried about losing....
Happy to see I’m not the only one who can feel once like god and some days after like a pile a garbage
Oh OK.

Edit: Yes it is Bourgeois
commies take another L
Ya and GoGo Poster Punch for the logo
Ahhh so it was a problem of reddit then. Anyways thanks man. Appreciate ur work.
Would probably work better for me but you don’t have to go through the effort. Can you also dm me your socials or something were I can shout you out? Or are you only on reddit?
    The no glow versions are on the album now
    Ok, I'll edit it later then. And yeah I'm only on reddit.
Your choice was aesthetically correct with the rest of the rank symbols. Personally, I find it nice that you can differentiate the ranks easily when they're small just by the single negative space. But that's just the graphic designer in me. Congrats on such a successful design, well deserved.
Ah, ok. As I said, don't know this community.
    That’s fine mate, just wanted to explain why it looks ”weird”
Put your PC or console on top of a heater to get Cinematic™ mode, where it drops to 24 or lower fps. Burning through hardware is just the price for the pursuit of perfection
    Jokes aside, would that actually do anything on console? My ps4 is in a very awkward position, so it always gets very hot when playing afternoon, but I never noticed a frame drop
That was my first thought. How are you going to correct somebody's typing when you use shorthand u?
I’m skeptical, I just queued into 2s and my rando and I got two kickoff goals and one of the opponents left after he missed the save leaving the other dude to play for a minute and a half alone. Don’t be that person people.
Is it coincidence that their wifi goes down right after their team conceded a goal?
Actually you’re right hahaha some of them are not even comparable to bots. They look like they *just* picked up the game and it’s their first time holding a controller.

Sometimes I mess up with them a bit before forfeiting, but most of the time I just forfeit
Bruh, fr? Thats bs you are a bronze/silver you are basically the lowest players, 90% of all players will absolutely destroy you, thats so stupid, being toxic in silver
    Good thing about matchmaking systems is that they're competitive at any level. Aside from the top pros in SSL, there's no such thing as absolute skill in RL, just relative skill compared to the players you happen to get matched with.

Bad thing about that is it means there's always someone to compare yourself to, and players who have a really, deeply insecure ego are going to do that *constantly*.

>!Good thing about *that*, though, is that [I find it really really funny to get under their skin, win or lose](https://i.imgur.com/gQ97eNt.png)!<
        Yea but i mean like just in general, they are very low skilled players so you shouldnt shittalk bc you arent the best
I would love to play some games there, losing anything on purpose and if they start trashtalking just crush them.
    Smurf?
        Is it smurfing tho if you only punish toxic people?
            It's smurfing for a just cause
            I have a smurf (so my rank doesnt get obliterated when playing with friends) but if you start a new account you start as a bronze so its easy to get in bronze
Pretty sure OP got it

As you might be able to guess, we won the match.

        Not to be that guy, but nazi stuff isn't joking material. Nowadays you really don't know who's saying dumb shit for laughs or for real. Just the other day I was playing bfv and some dude with a nordic myth name started to spew nazi shit and white supremacy links, never know when it's for real. 


Besides the fact that nazis were shitheads who killed millions. Idk. My thoughts.


Edit: man, didn't expect people would get triggered over this, lol
            I don't disagree, Joking about something like the holocaust is something I certainly would never do, or laugh over. However I don't necessarily have a problem with jokes about the Third Reich in general. Same with other countries.

Basically "" was only an expression used by the Nazis to express victory and it doesn't show how bad they really were by raising a right hand 60 degrees up

Nevertheless I understand your concern. Trust me, White supremacists, (Neo-)Nazis would be a lot more obvious to spot by how obnoxious they are, and I hate them as much as you.
                Yeah I understand. It wasn't something as fucked like a holocaust joke or smth but still, that deleted comment responding to mine up top was a dickwad repeating that shit. So, yk... People have to guess wether whoever wrote that is edgy, an asshole, or a nazi so... Yeah. Gave you the benefit of the doubt and I'm glad you feel the way you do. There are some rotten folks out there.
            Joking about any dark subject can be considered "not joking mateial" for different people depending on their sense of humour. There's no right or wrong with dark humour - the scale of darkness that is acceptable entirely depends on how parties take dark jokes. 

Because of this I agree that it was quite silly of him to have a flair with that in a public subreddit where loads of people will see it - he has no idea who will be offended and who will find it funny, so it's dangerous to assume everyone will find it funny.

But also, it's important to understand that not everyone has the same sense of humour! Dark humour makes fun of these terrible things, and whilst I understand this crosses the line for some people, for others, it is acceptable and this DOES NOT MEAN THEY ARE SICK PEOPLE WITH CRAZY BELIEFS. Last part is important, some people seem to believe that if you laugh at nazi jokes, find films like Borat funny, then you are somehow a horrid person - no.
                There's a difference between joking about it in person, with people that know you're joking, and doing it on the internet where intent is extremely hard to judge. This is especially true when joking about extremist beliefs like neo Nazi ideology, nationalist fascism, sexism, racism, etc because people use the internet as a safe place to share these ideas and try to find like minded individuals. 

And unfortunately people are highly impressionable. If you see enough comments extolling white supremecy, it plants seeds. Some or even most of those comments may be jokes, but again it's hard to tell and the jokers could end up having a hand in solidifying the beliefs of a person who is starting to tend towards extremism. 

It's perfectly fine and normal to have a dark sense of humor. But the internet generally isn't a great place for casual dark humor especially when the humor centers around extremist political ideologies the people actually believe in.
                    Very good point. When you reach a large audience you don't know who's reading what you're writing and how they'll take that in
                Oh yeah I understand. Places like truestl and chapotraphouse (rip) made some really fucked up jokes sometimes, but it was understood anything written there, wasn't forreal (doubly so for TrueSTL). Still, /r/rocketleague is kept pretty clean and aside from the occasional joke you don't really expect to come here for humor. Context, yk. 


I don't really get the really edgy humor (yk like big mouth or some of the fucked up rick and morty jokes) but I understand why someone could find em funny. I dont mean to say that people who make edgy jokes are assholes, it just depends on how aware the person telling the joke is of who might hear/read it (and obvious really heinous stuff that absolutely should not be joked about, like slavery, holocaust, famine, etc., but that should go w/o saying).
                    Big mouth and rick and morty are edgy to you?

It's perfectly fine and normal to have a dark sense of humor. But the internet generally isn't a great place for casual dark humor especially when the humor centers around extremist political ideologies the people actually believe in.
        Very good point. When you reach a large audience you don't know who's reading what you're writing and how they'll take that in
    Oh yeah I understand. Places like truestl and chapotraphouse (rip) made some really fucked up jokes sometimes, but it was understood anything written there, wasn't forreal (doubly so for TrueSTL). Still, /r/rocketleague is kept pretty clean and aside from the occasional joke you don't really expect to come here for humor. Context, yk. 


I don't really get the really edgy humor (yk like big mouth or some of the fucked up rick and morty jokes) but I understand why someone could find em funny. I dont mean to say that people who make edgy jokes are assholes, it just depends on how aware the person telling the joke is of who might hear/read it (and obvious really heinous stuff that absolutely should not be joked about, like slavery, holocaust, famine, etc., but that should go w/o saying).
        Big mouth and rick and morty are edgy to you?
*Proceeds to be that guy*
Thank you joke police

        WHOA you know the secret code too?? I've never seen someone else who knew it before 

But seriously you know absolutely no context to that guy's joke but still decided to start the virtue signaling early huh. I probably wouldn't make a joke like that myself but telling someone else not to without any context is ridiculous.
The Nazis are so bad that the guy who killed Hitler is actually my hero!
Is this a copy pasta?
Everything is joking material, with the correct build up and punch line. You can't go around being sensitive on the internet.

Nazis were cringe because they didn’t kill your grandparents and you ended up being born. Not pog at all 😡
Tbf, getting laid is more of an accomplishment than I would manage in their position.
Yeah I understand. It wasn't something as fucked like a holocaust joke or smth but still, that deleted comment responding to mine up top was a dickwad repeating that shit. So, yk... People have to guess wether whoever wrote that is edgy, an asshole, or a nazi so... Yeah. Gave you the benefit of the doubt and I'm glad you feel the way you do. There are some rotten folks out there.
There's a difference between joking about it in person, with people that know you're joking, and doing it on the internet where intent is extremely hard to judge. This is especially true when joking about extremist beliefs like neo Nazi ideology, nationalist fascism, sexism, racism, etc because people use the internet as a safe place to share these ideas and try to find like minded individuals.
