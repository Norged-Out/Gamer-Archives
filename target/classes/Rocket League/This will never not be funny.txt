    The only good excuse
        And the only good boi
            Also the only good scenario.
    It‚Äôs understandable.

        Hey friend! I'm now where near your level but would love to 1v1 someday!
    Hey I‚Äôm a puppy*

Work on your grammar buddy boy, then you can start posting on reddit, okay? Thanks.
        ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm a puppy.‚Äù

Your grammar could use some work too.
            don‚Äôt feed the trolls :(
            also, Reddit*
        I just downvoted your comment.
 
# FAQ
 
## What does this mean?
 
The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.
 
## Why did you do this?
 
There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:
 
* Rudeness towards other Redditors,
* Spreading incorrect information,
* Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a `/s`.
 
## Am I banned from the Reddit?
 
No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.
 
## I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?
 
Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.
 
## How can I prevent this from happening in the future?
 
Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.
            Hahahaha this is beautiful
            Hey, just a heads up but I'm stealing this, thanks.
                This is a copypasta. And a damn good one too

        Wtf
        Reddit is a proper noun, please use capitalization correctly.
        This guy is either a terrible troll account, or someone that needs a little help.
            Troll accounts ARE people that need help.
        You don‚Äôt understand how usernames work; do you?
        That input was unneeded you deserve my downvote.
        Ah, so you have chosen...downvote
        I thought it was funny
        Mate, just shush lmao no one cares about this person or that person's grammar and spelling.

Browsing r/all and saw this. I only know the reference because I've seen maybe 2 clips of this game before. Can confirm this is still funny.
    It will be free to play very soon! End of the month hopefully. You should give it a try.
        And to anyone afraid they'll be entering the game too late:
I entered very late.
200 hours played now.
It's my favorite online competitive game now lol.
        I won't. Video games are not a great interest of mine. But thank you.
            [removed]
                It used to be going to play table top games at my FLGS on Saturdays because I didn't have much free time. Before that I played sports and went geocaching. I am struggling right now.
I played with someone called something like "Am Dog" and the profile pic was a cute dog. When they scored I typed a woof woof in chat. Made my day.
Thanks I'm taking this for my profile idea, you'll see some more ballchasers ingame soon :)
    I'm in this gif and I don't like it
Epic funny
Air Bud would've been good too!

A perfect border doesn‚Äôt exi-
Dog, professional ball chaser
If only there was a feature in bakkes mod to make the ball look like a tennis ball.
Good Boi
I'd be mad if I had ure name
I finally got The Mercurial so people will have to look up the definition of my title to understand my play style.

I hate how I have this on epic and they don't do pictures, they are 3rd world
I could play consecutive 0 to 0 games and every one is defensive. The ball would literally never move.
But this is funny
    That's the point.
That is actually pretty funny
I love this
