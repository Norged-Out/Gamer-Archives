[[My closest friend and 2s partner past away this week. I'll miss you buddy]]





Do you have any saved replays with them?
    I have some, not a lot, it's not my habit to save replays. He used to save more replays cause he actually scored some cool goals, but I don't have access to it now =/
        Check ballchasing.com and calculated.gg! You can search for his steam id/gamertag and find any uploaded replays with him in them. There may not be many but it's worth a go
            Thanks for the tip.. Hope I can find some nice goals so I can make a little montage
                [removed]
                    Calculated.gg has more recent matches.. I'll try to watch some of them tomorrow

                        Close one!
                If you decide to make a montage, I'm still learning how to edit, but would be more than happy to edit it for free.
                    I would also be open to taking a crack :)
                        This is really cool, guys.  You got my view and like if it gets done.
                            Let’s see if he can manage to get the clips together first! Then we can let my noob editor skills loose ;P
                That sounds really fcking awesome actually, you should do it.

            Didn't know these sites existed, 

searched myself, 1 result from 2015 :)

Lost 5-1 :(
            Holy shit, I didn't know about this. Super cool.
                Yup this is actually So Dope
            Wow, I didn't know this existed and I appear in 388 of other peoples replays lol.
                Oh shit, you get demo’d in 247 of them!
        Sorry to hear about your friend. :(


DM me, I may be able to locate some recent replay files.
            You didn't answer my DMs =(

Edit: guys, he answered :)
                Might take some time. Be patient, friend.
                Bruhh
                Feels bad man... Psyonix please
                hoping you found those replays buddy.
            Thank you.

I just sent you a DM
                Hey did you find the replays? u/rodrigoa1990
                    Not really... Just the ones from calculated.gg and Devin sent me our last 10 matches, but tbh there wasn't much there.. 

And I'm still kinda awkward about asking his sister to go through his computer to send me the files so idk if I'll ever do that
        psyonix, give this man his replay files!
        I'm sure you could find a good ammount of replays on ballchasing.com. Some poeple auto-upload replays with bakkesmod so i usually find multiple replays of whoever i'm looking for.

*passed away

Thanks for the condolences guys.. It really means a lot in this difficult time

We bought RL back in 2015 and we used to play for like 2 hours almost every day for the past 2 years. Talking a bunch of random nonsense on discord while we played. It's gonna be hard, suddenly not being able to talk to him =(

He was a great player and an even better person.

&nbsp;

Edit: Thanks for the offers to party up and play together. But honestly, I don't think I can play RL anytime soon, specially 2s... Also, I play on the south american server, and most of you guys are probably in north america or europe.. But I appreciate the offers :)
    My condolences.

I feel you mate, my 2s partner committed suicide two months ago.

I use his car-setup from time to time and it helped me honestly. RL is not the same anymore, tho.

*sending virtual hug*
        Shit bro that’s deep wish I could say something that would help but I’m not good with words. To both of ur duo partners RIP 💔
        Damn, that's tough.. I'm sorry for your loss

Virtual hugs to you too, mate
        I also feel you guys. My only friend who played rocket league died of brain cancer a couple weeks ago.  He was my partner and we had the same rank. It was really hard to play ranked twos for the first time without him. People are always here for you and your never alone feel free to give me a message.
        Rest In Peace.
        Beyond the Grey Sky by 311 is a relevant song that, in a situation like yours, helped me process and deal. I hope it does the same for you. It's hard. I'm so sorry.

https://youtu.be/5Izea0vj9wo
        You guys should team up, it won't be the same, but at least you both are coming from a common place. Who knows what could happen.
        I’m so sorry.
        RIP to both of your duos partners. You made me cry....
    I’m sorry bro..that’s really rough, you got this tho man! stay strong. Continue you’re guy’s legacy and get to GC for him!
    Dang I can only imagine what you must be feeling right about now

Squad up. Im sorry for your loss, it looks like yall had a blast together.
    [deleted]
        When I go, I hope my brothers can play  whatever save files I have left. Something weird about gaming as a hobby is that we can back up stuff. My hockey stick doesn't have unfinished games, my guitar won't have any more of my own songs to write. But you bet your ass that there's still some golden bananas left to collect on DK isle.

I hope there's tears at every bongo drums lol
            Amen brother.
        Gamers don't die. We respawn.
    Equip his antenna bro
    Damn man, condolences.
    I'm sorry for your loss, i offer you my condolences.
    I had the same type of friend in Destiny and the amount of fun we had together still stands out way above any other fun had.  His skill enabled us to sherpa a lot of Destiny folks.
I was able to have some closure and meet his family and let them see what a positive impact he had on the world outside his small community and home.  I just wanted to see I'm there with you in those feelings and have my condolences.
        Rest in Peace.
    Sorry for your loss bro, I know the feeling me and my friend got the game when it was free on PS and we managed to get to platinum together, he passed away 2 years ago and I miss him a lot, I’m diamond now nearly champion so I like to think that he would be too if he was still here
    Aw no man 😭 Hope you feel better man!😢😢 I Think My Eyes Are Sweating
    You’re a good friend, I can only hope I have as good as friends as you are. My condolences. I’ve been playing RL since 2016 and I couldn’t imagine losing my best bud and 2s partner. God bless you I hope you find a small beam happiness for this bad time.
    I am incredibly sorry for you
    Hey, he had you till the end.
    I normally roll my eyes at posts like this because circlejerk has ruined me, but something about the simplicity of this image hit me like a punch to the gut. I've been through this same thing before and you got me crying first thing in the morning. I feel for you bud. Game friendships are very real. I can't imagine knowing the person on the other side of the headset left this world.
    Sorry for your loss. Don't forget, you can always visit your friend in your memories.
    I played against you both not so long ago, I do remember. 

I'm sorry pal, sending some love from France.
    Bro I'm so sorry for what happened. 
You can do it tho. 
If u need to talk or play we're all here for ya.
    He was a gamer. We all know he'll already have respawned in heaven by now. You know he's in a good place now.
    He’s stealing your boost in spirit
    Scully I swear I’ve played with you before. My condolences :(
    May he score in heaven!
R.I.P. Wagnesio. He's somewhere better making super buttery 1s plays, waiting for his partner to join him again.
    Never thought car soccer would make me cry, but here we are

If my teammate did this, it would be the first time he ever passed.
    damn, that's actually savage xD
        Wagnesio would have laughed, bet. Im sorry your friend is gone.

            The mother fucker is laughing right now.

        Although it was a joke, you took that well, I’d spam offensive content until I got a lifetime ban. I’m really sorry for what happened, I just really hope for you it wasn’t sudden and out of the blue. Death isn’t easy for me, so I really feel for you. Can’t imagine losing a buddy like that, there are no words any of us could say for that. Love that you shared though, takes courage. And support from the community y’all loved should be given.
    bruh
    Damn
        Shit
            Piss
                Vomit
    LOL savage

Despite my laughter at this joke, that is actually a pretty touching photo, I gotta say.  

(And hopefully OP could enjoy this joke a bit, himself; I’m sure his partner was a solid playmaker)

It may or may not be intentional, but the lighting in the two photos (peaking sun in the top one, setting sun in the bottom one) just adds more feels to this
    I totally get that
Sorry that your friend passed.  Happy he will live on in your memories and replays.
Sorry for your loss man. The pain you’re more than likely feeling is normal, and you will get through it. I wish you nothing but the best of days to come.
    i only see 1
        Yeah I’m tripping lemme edit that.
Sorry for your loss, try to remember that people are never truly gone until they are forgotten. Remember your friend and cherish the time you did have and spent, it meant something to the both of you and that's special.
i really didn’t wanna cry rn :( 

sorry for your loss brother.
Man thiis such a simple pic of the before and now but so fuckinn symbolic it hit me like a truck, sorry for ur loss man that's tough, I wish more people could understand or experience the type of unique bonds u create while sharing the same love for car soccer
Sorry to hear that 🙁
Didnt wanna be crying in the club rn :/
My feels😕
Sorry to hear that man, hope you and their family well.
Okay I would have never thought Rocket League could make me cry
    Literally the second I read the part of them passing away I immediately cried. This shit happens anytime there's any mention of a loved one passing in a post, most terrifying thing in the world to me.

I know the feeling. A long time gaming friend of mine passed a few years ago. He had cancer and never told any of us. He was just always cheerful and positive and it hurts my heart when I look back at Steam or Discord messages and see the last things he had said to me. Stay strong man!
May I ask what happened? Sorry for your loss.
Sorry. Much love.
Vi que você é brazuca. Minhas condolências, man. Foi de covid?
Sorry to hear that RIP
Deep condolences to you
I'm so sorry...I can't recommend therapy enough. We could all use a little guidance through the grief process. I lost my wife in January and it has affected my friends in ways I didn't imagine. Losing a friend hurts in ways we don't understand. Best of luck to you and know grief lasts forever but it changes and hurts less with time. Someday the memories will bring joy and not just pain. If you need to message a random stranger who won't judge feel free to reach out.
RIP wagnesio the GOAT
the picture just makes it even worse
Sorry to hear that man, really am.  The simple imagery hits home and I wish you the best going forward.  It will be impossible forget your friend when you play but you will get through it.  You know they wouldn't want you to feel down playing something you both loved to do.  I hope you feel better and can find enjoyment in the game still.  Putting this post together tells me a lot about the bond you both had that you'd go to the effort to do this.  I'm sure your friend would appreciate that you respect them so highly.
Damn dude, the title made me sad but the photo actually hit me hard.  Sorry about your loss.

    You shouldn’t use a meme to pay respects to actual human beings
        I think it’s an easy and simple way to show someone you have empathy towards them. No harm or disrespect is meant by it so Idt it’s an issue
RIP
I'm sorry you lost your buddy. My husband and I lost a friend a year ago. Rocket league was the last game we all played together a few days before he took his life. It took me a month to even get back on the game. Feel free to hit me up any time if you need to vent or want to get back into rocket league. I can guarantee that the rocket league community is here for you❤
:(
Goddamn, dude. My deepest condolences to you.
Sorry for your loss. I’d hate this to happen to one of us. RIP.
He will live on in the replays of the games you have together
RIP to a friend to us all
RIP bro, my childhood friend is my dubs partner and I’d be devastated if he passed.. he will be remembered!
I, for one, would love for this to end up as a statue in one of the stadiums. Don't ever let them tell you online friendships aren't friendships.
Everyone is so wholesome. Where are these good vibes in matches??
friend died give upvote
Sorry to hear man. My next goal & win will be dedicated to your friend.
I’m truly sorry for your loss. My older brother got me into rocket league and we played almost every day until he was killed in January 2020. Getting back into Rocket League was by far the hardest and most helpful thing for me. I play solely with his car set up as a memorial to him. I wish I could say it gets easier as time goes on... just hang in there. The community will always have your back
    Sorry for your loss.
Friend dead,  now give me karma
    Assuming they’re actually dead. Not saying it isn’t true but it’s kind of wild that we let two screen shots of a video game and a few selected words make us feel some type of way. This could be fake for all we know but we choose to act like it’s real. Idk it’s weird I’m super high rn
    It’s more like the support that he gets from other people. When someone close to you has died, I doubt karma is what you care about. But in a situation where you are upset and every upvote is someone supporting you, that could be a really nice thing.
        Really? you doubt karma is what he cares about? He literally went and made this stupid fucking photo for attention. Imagine if you posted on IG a photo of you and your friend with a recreation with you alone and sad. You're making the person's death about you, it's shitty and pathetic.
Rip
:(
that picture rlly hit me in the gut
I'm so sorry for your loss dude. Video games connect us in such a magical way. I hope the memories you look back too provide you comfort.
This is so fuckin sad... I’m so sorry for your loss. I hope there’s a better place out there where he goes and becomes champion
Sorry to hear that man
I imagine that no words can console you my friend. Losing a friend too soon hurts very very much. I offer you my condolences and I hope you and his family find peace. Rip Wagnesio.
From a stranger to hopefully a friend, my condolences, I've lost people as well if you ever need a friend DM me any time

Cheers to you and your friend, both amazing players I imagine
Ii hope you managed to save some replays of your games together. My condolences
Dang... Sorry bro. That must have been tough. Hope you feel better soon.
Damn brother, I’m sorry. This photo moved me. Make him proud and climb those ranks man
Sorry for your loss dude... my mind and heart is with you:)
Your memories of him will live on forever. So sorry to hear this man. If you need anything don’t hesitate to reach out.
Sorry for the loss of your friend. Cherish the memories playing together.
Sorry to hear that man, must be really hard. If you’re in the US and are ever looking for someone to play with hit me up with a PM
Wish you the best and may your buddy rest in peace
Omg I'm fucking crying. Very sorry for your loss
😔
My condolences. I hope you continue to kick ass in everything you do, I'm sure they would have wanted that
This hit me in the feels! Sorry for your loss man
I’m so sorry for your loss. I’m happy to play and chat at anytime if you want someone to talk to.

I’m not great but I’m calm headed and happy to play at any time.
Godlike713 on PS4. I cn never replace you and your friends friendship, but if you want someone who can personally relate and we cab kick back and play some league. Don't hesitate to message me mate. Prayers your way.
I’m not crying, you are
Holy shit. I played against you the other night in 2s. RIP! Try and keep a happy heart, like your pal would have wanted. What a small RL world! <3
GGs in the chat boys...
Damn bro. I cannot imagine the pain your in rn if I lost my best friend/ 2s parter I’d be absolutely lost. Surround yourself with others and keep your head up.
Rip🙏
i apologize if this is inappropriate for this post but.. i’ve always kinda wondered how people found out about an online friend passing away, I feel if any of my online friends passed I would never know why they stopped playing all of a sudden
I saw this on another sub and knew I had to come and say I am sorry about this. These things happen and it’s always so painful when it does, I know how it feels to lose someone and I know it’s hard. Know you have a lot of people here for support.
I'm sorry man. You can get through this. If you need a friend to talk to or want to chill in some games you can hit me up.
Damn man sorry for your loss.. I’m here if you ever need someone to game with
Ay man, I just want you to know that we all have your back. I’m sure Wagnesio is hitting some crispy flip resets upstairs right now.

Rest In Peace, to the partner we all wish we had.
I'm sorry to hear that. I wish you all the best.
Oof that picture hits hard. Sorry for your loss.
Rest In Peace... my sincerest condolences.
Rest In Peace.   


I'm sorry.
TRUE GAMERS WILL ALWAYS BE REMEMBERED
Sorry for your loss.
PIPPIN: I didn't think it would end this way.

GANDALF: End? No, the journey doesn't end here. Death is just another path, one that we all must take. The grey rain-curtain of this world rolls back, and all turns to silver glass, and then you see it.

PIPPIN: What? Gandalf? See what?

GANDALF: White shores, and beyond, a far green country under a swift sunrise.

PIPPIN: Well, that isn't so bad.

GANDALF: No. No, it isn't.
It's never fun losing a gaming friend...; my own first experience with this was, well, way back in 2003 in the 1st guild I joined in EverQuest.

A small group of us went out into an area one evening for some random leveling up and loot gathering; much mayhem, fun, and several near team-wipes ensued with all sorts of good-natured ribbing back and forth among us.

Barely 24 hours later, I log in to discover that one of that group had abruptly passed away of an undetected heart condition; it hit us all pretty hard, but we carried on...pretty sure that's what he would have done....
    Hope you're alright
        Like I said, this was waaaaaaaay back in 2003-ish; the guild would go on for a number of years, even having an in-character wedding between 2 of it's leaders that an actual 'green name' GM showed up to officiate!  The groom, a Monk, challenged me(as a Beastlord) to a 1v1 duel(lots of battles and challenges were part of the party)...he won, but he admitted he was sweating bullets for a few moments late in the fight.  

Yeah, we were a pretty tight bunch....
WHO THE HELL GIVES THE F AWARD ON THESE POSTS?? Their friend just died, saying F is one of the most disrespectful things ever
F
Apparently 2 screenshots and a tragic title can give u +10k upvotes and a bunch of rewards
Nothing like a bit of karma, eh?
[deleted]
    What makes you think he's doing it for the likes? When someone you care for passes away reaching out and taking to others can be one of the best remedies. This is one of the major strengths of the Reddit community.
        [deleted]
            Everyone copes differently. Talking to strangers is often easier than talking to close ones. 

Especially when you can’t go and physically be with close ones.
                No bro... if your friend dies you don’t post it on rocket league Reddit ....
                    If your friend dies you can do whatever you want if it helps you get through it. 

It’s not like he’s posting personal information.
    This
Guy says his friend past away, very very sad....Kid names Ben in the comments: “ITS PASSED IDIOT OMG LIKE READ A BOOK FOR ONCE!”
Using your dead friend for upvotes?

Also, sorry for your loss.
Imagine using your friends death for fake internet points
The human side of me is very sad for your loss, losing someone is never easy. The grammar nazi side of me however....
Passed*
Do people actually believe this shit?
    its hard to believe but just in case it happened I wouldn't call it shit. Not only is it uncivil but it also could be extremely offensive.
Gg for sure man. My heart goes out to you. Get to GC for your boy
Psyonix could release his most played preset as a bit in game just a thought
I’m so sorry
Someone more talented than me needs to 3d print a wagnesio car and couple it with a screen mounted in there playing a montage on a loop. People on here could bust that out in a weekend I swear. This makes my heart hurt.

I’m sorry for your loss, I hope the best for you and others related to him
Sorry for your loss. I had a very close friend pass away about 12 years ago and I still think about him every day. You get past the sad feeling, it just becomes part of your life, like one of those friends you haven't seen for ages ... if that makes sense.
Sorry for your loss man, that sucks.
Need a partner bud? I’ll play with you:) I’m on the road to GC currently.
😢 sending love.
Sorry bro.
RIP. ILY. BEST WISHES.
So sorry for your loss dude

Sorry for asking but what happened? How did he die?
And I know that he misses you 2! 
If someone made a post like this about him, your a true friend!
I gotta be honest, that image you uploaded with it, it gives me goosebumps, and probably other people also!
Ah yes, who doesn’t love posting their friends death to a rocket league subreddit. Was being a 2s partner all he ever did or something?
I'm so sorry for your loss.
heartbreaking:/ so sry :(


me and my gf found two great friends on RL years ago and i can imagine this loss after endless play nights and good talks.
Love you fellow gamer, v sad n touching post ❤️
May he Rest In Peace as I’m sorry for your loss. I’m sure you’ll cherish all the great gaming memories you’ve shared!
Wow this is sad
Fuck man, I feel for you. Lost one of my childhood friends and long time gaming partner early last year.

You don't want to hear it right now but it gets easier with time. Keep his memory alive through talking to friends about him, your memories together and generally how you feel. Definitely don't try to supress it, if you do it'll only hit you harder later on and not on your own terms. Shoot me a message if you need to chat, reading your post made me cry. ❤️
Sorry for your loss, I hope you'll be able to grow in the game for the both of you.
Rest In Peace.
Passed
*Passed
This teared me up a bit. I lost a good friend in Januari. Tough times, still really miss him around. But it gets better. 

My condolences OP.
Don't normally comment but this got me hard. Its hard to lose a friend. May he rest in peace.
In the end he's just waiting for that long shot pass brother.
Some day you will meet together again
All the love for you. I’m so sorry for your loss, late night talks with friends on discord are the best.
Wow didn’t kill me on their mk 2s
So sorry for your loss, I can't even imagine what you must be going through.
God damn.
Im not really good with saying this sort of thing, but sorry for your loss

get to GC for him!

Legends
Rest easy. I pray for you and your friend. I’m sorry for your loss
Ill be your second :( even if im bad.
So sorry for your loss
Rest in Peace to Wagnesio. I bet he was a good player and an even better person. I didn’t know him in the slightest, but it still hurts to know that a community member was lost today...

OP I hope you don’t feel too sad about this, he wouldn’t want you to be sad. Just know that he is in a better place, and kicking everybodys ass up in the stars right about now.

Something I tell myself when something bad happens is... “Don’t feel bad because it had to end, but instead enjoy the fact that it even happened.” Don’t dwell on this my brother, he will be missed.

R.I.P Wagnesio!
Man, that's rough, stay strong and get to GC for him
F
I'm sorry for your loss :I . If you need a doubles mate, you can add me. I'm C1 but I play like a D3 ^^. DM me if you want so :)
Hey man, sorry for your loss

I saw you mentioned you wanted to make a montage for him. If you want, I could make one for ya if you sent me clips. I've made a few before and if you want I could dm you examples of stuff Ive done

If you just wanna do it yourself I totally understand. Just throwing the offer out there in case
Will ride for Wagnesio when I play later
Man I feel so bad :(. Sorry.
F*ck this hit me right in the feels bro. My condolences. F
Hey man, I don’t know you but I love you. I hope you can properly grieve and keep the spirit of your friend alive. Celebrate his life and who he was, keep your head up, brother. ❤️
Okay but you didn't have to make me cry.. fuck.

I love this community.
😔
I'm sorry to hear man, the spirit never dies, keep him in your memories and he'll live forever. Keep safe, stay healthy.
What was his name
I’m fucking sobbing.. I’m so sorry. I wish I could give you the biggest hug in the world, right now..
What is that antena? Let's all honour him and wear it for a week or so. We can do that ppl, right? We can be toxic as hell, but we can do stuff like this, am I right?
Sorry for your loss, stay strong buddy
The person who introduced me to rocket league passed a few weeks ago.  I haven't fully come to terms.  


My condolences on your loss.
Sorry for your loss man
Fuck Man! That Picture got me emotional real quick! I‘m just so sorry for your loss... can‘t even imagine what you‘re going through rn.
Hey mn...why u gotta hurt us in the feels like that? 
Im a grown ass man.
U hang in there..add me up if needed..same tag name.
That is sad man.  Take care.
F
Sorry to hear that buddy I hope you're doing ok. RIP Wagnesio
Man, this gives me goosebumps. If you ever need a teammate I will do the best I can. I have built the best friendship with this game. Knowing and trusting your partner. This is the way.
Condolecenses... I'm sure he keeps an eye on you bro
I’m so sorry to hear that. I feel your pain. I met one of my best friends playing Halo years ago. We would always play together. One day he committed suicide. His number is still in my phone. His gamer tag is still on my friends list. It’s rough, bud. If you ever need someone to talk to or an extra player let me know. You’ll get through this. Be strong.
Sorry for you man. I'm not good with words when it comes to feelings and stuff but I hope ur okay and that he can rest in peace.
A tear came to my eye. May you find your peace friend.
I’m so sorry for your loss <3
Sorry to hear <3
Sorry for your loss
May he rest in peace and may you find a new 2s partner :) Stay strong bud!
:(
I know the feeling... happened to me 1 year ago and every time I connect on discord it feels like he will be there, ready to talk and laugh about anything.

Good luck my friend, I am so sorry for your loss
I feel my heart crack.
Inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji'un
Rest in peace
Sorry for your loss, that really sucks 😢
Good luck!
I feel your loss.
Sorry for your loss mate. I know you don’t know me but feel free to PM me if you need someone to talk to or play some matches with. Hang in there.

Rip ❤️
Hey my man. I am so sorry to hear that a friend of yours who has gone through the struggles of life and through Psyonix's ranking system to high achievements has suddenly passed. My deepest and heartfelt condolences. May he rest in peace and fly high in Champions Field. I am making rivers under my eyes for you and your friend, not just your rocket league 2's buddy, but a friend. The great thing of gaming in games like Rocket League and other team based games is that you make bonds with the people that you play with the most and you turn that bonds into friendships. These friendships can last you a long way and I hope his friendship and legacy will last you long way as well. My sincere condolences again. May you find light at the end of this dark tunnel.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you are surrounded by friends, family, food, shelter, and joy.

This picture is sad 😞 sorry brother for your lose
Aw man. I'm sorry to see this. I also have a buddy I met through RL back in 2015. We still play daily. He's become a great friend of mine. My condolences.
Wow!

I’m so happy that the RL community can actually be a non toxic place when some shit really happens. OP, sorry for your loss my brotha. We got you though. Like many have said, if you need a 2s partner or wanna chat, hit me up. I’m all too familiar with this feeling.
Damn. I hope when you come back playing rocket League you go straight to chaos.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
GG's
I know that I cant relate to that however hard I try. I can just tell u to stay strong. He will watch your matches from Heaven
My condolences :(
I’m so sorry.
RIP. Sorry for your loss man.
Rest in peace, hope you can get back to playing the games you enjoy like rocket league soon
RIP Wagnesio. I’m sorry for your loss.

This post hit me different because of how i use RL to play with my friends and girlfriend, my honest condolences
So incredibly sorry for your loss. I hope they are at peace.
Its not *just* a game

Sorry to hear that Rl is a good community
My condolences. I haven't had any friend die before, but I would be as distraught as you are. I hope you get through this
Sorry for your loss bro.

Sorry for your loss =((
Sorry for your loss.. idk what I’d do if that happened to me

I’m so sorry for your loss, my deepest condolences to you and his family
I’m not crying you are!
Honestly rocket League community is the most wholesome community I've ever seen in my gaming experience( outside of the game of course ). I give my condolences to you and I hope you can move on in your life and make great things happen💚
Rest easy Wagnesio. Tm8 not trash ✊✊✊✊
Wagnesio will be immortalized as a RL GOAT and a great friend

Actually brought a tear to my eye. That's so sad man! <3
Ahh yes. Friend dies a few days ago, let’s post it on reddit! Cmon guys. This is clearly fake. All he had to to do was take a screenshot with a car there, then take another where it’s not, and say “guys my friend is dead”
Damn... this actually hit me
También soy un Rodrigo de 1990. Si algún día quieres jugar, avísame.

Por ahora, fuerza.
Sorry for your loss.
Condolences man, I hope you'll manage to go through this bad period asap, much love from Italy
I know no words will help you feel better, but stay strong my guy <3 keep ya head up
I'm so sorry bro, my dm's are always open. No one should have to go through that alone. Whatever helps you heal homie ❤️
Rest in peace 🙏🙏 

My condolences to you.
Why does the screenshots give me the same vibes as the beginning of up? Now I'm even more sad...
I’m sorry for your loss buddy. Hopefully the reddit family will all be here for you
I'm so so sorry, we'll get through it together
My condolences

Scully I’ve I’m played against y’all before. Sorry to hear brother.

PfL-Inertia.
I’m so sorry man :/
Lost a best friend this past December to an accidental overdose. He had been clean for over a year. I had been playing games with him the past 15-20 years. It was really difficult for me to play any games at first. I swear he is playing pranks on me at home. Lights flickering and thermostats being set at 69 degrees (we have a nest schedule that automatically sets temp to 65 in summer). I can’t say it gets “better”. You just learn to cope with it and remember them the best way you can. Much love ❤️
✊🏼🖤 stay strong bro we fall but we allways stand back up , my condolences.
May he Rest In Peace ❤️ stay strong friend. You’ve got people around who care for you in this difficult time
Rest in piece man
😥😥
Meus pêsames bro
RIP
I’m so sorry. My condolences.
Fffffffffffucccckkk bro....sorry for your loss

I'm crying now. Thanks. 😭
I Play 2s with my best friend all the time, this made me tear up...
So sorry for your lost😭😭😨😰
Awwwwww..... I'm sorry man. Thats the saddest rocket league post I've ever seen.
Rest in power
My condolences ❤️❤️❤️

Those damn onions again! Sorry for your loss mate
Damn
Doubt you'll see this OP but just wanted to say I'm sorry you lost your friend. All the best.
I wanna cry now :(
I'm really sorry for your loss.
I have some, not a lot, it's not my habit to save replays. He used to save more replays cause he actually scored some cool goals, but I don't have access to it now =/
    Check ballchasing.com and calculated.gg! You can search for his steam id/gamertag and find any uploaded replays with him in them. There may not be many but it's worth a go
        Thanks for the tip.. Hope I can find some nice goals so I can make a little montage
            [removed]
                Calculated.gg has more recent matches.. I'll try to watch some of them tomorrow

                    Close one!
            If you decide to make a montage, I'm still learning how to edit, but would be more than happy to edit it for free.
                I would also be open to taking a crack :)
                    This is really cool, guys.  You got my view and like if it gets done.
                        Let’s see if he can manage to get the clips together first! Then we can let my noob editor skills loose ;P
            That sounds really fcking awesome actually, you should do it.

        Didn't know these sites existed, 

searched myself, 1 result from 2015 :)

Lost 5-1 :(
        Holy shit, I didn't know about this. Super cool.
            Yup this is actually So Dope
        Wow, I didn't know this existed and I appear in 388 of other peoples replays lol.
            Oh shit, you get demo’d in 247 of them!
    Sorry to hear about your friend. :(


DM me, I may be able to locate some recent replay files.
        You didn't answer my DMs =(

Edit: guys, he answered :)
            Might take some time. Be patient, friend.
            Bruhh
            Feels bad man... Psyonix please
            hoping you found those replays buddy.
        Thank you.

I just sent you a DM
            Hey did you find the replays? u/rodrigoa1990
                Not really... Just the ones from calculated.gg and Devin sent me our last 10 matches, but tbh there wasn't much there.. 

And I'm still kinda awkward about asking his sister to go through his computer to send me the files so idk if I'll ever do that
    psyonix, give this man his replay files!
    I'm sure you could find a good ammount of replays on ballchasing.com. Some poeple auto-upload replays with bakkesmod so i usually find multiple replays of whoever i'm looking for.

My condolences.

I feel you mate, my 2s partner committed suicide two months ago.

I use his car-setup from time to time and it helped me honestly. RL is not the same anymore, tho.

*sending virtual hug*
    Shit bro that’s deep wish I could say something that would help but I’m not good with words. To both of ur duo partners RIP 💔
    Damn, that's tough.. I'm sorry for your loss

Virtual hugs to you too, mate
    I also feel you guys. My only friend who played rocket league died of brain cancer a couple weeks ago.  He was my partner and we had the same rank. It was really hard to play ranked twos for the first time without him. People are always here for you and your never alone feel free to give me a message.
    Rest In Peace.
    Beyond the Grey Sky by 311 is a relevant song that, in a situation like yours, helped me process and deal. I hope it does the same for you. It's hard. I'm so sorry.

https://youtu.be/5Izea0vj9wo
    You guys should team up, it won't be the same, but at least you both are coming from a common place. Who knows what could happen.
    I’m so sorry.
    RIP to both of your duos partners. You made me cry....
I’m sorry bro..that’s really rough, you got this tho man! stay strong. Continue you’re guy’s legacy and get to GC for him!

[deleted]
    When I go, I hope my brothers can play  whatever save files I have left. Something weird about gaming as a hobby is that we can back up stuff. My hockey stick doesn't have unfinished games, my guitar won't have any more of my own songs to write. But you bet your ass that there's still some golden bananas left to collect on DK isle.

I hope there's tears at every bongo drums lol
        Amen brother.
    Gamers don't die. We respawn.
Equip his antenna bro
Damn man, condolences.
I'm sorry for your loss, i offer you my condolences.
I had the same type of friend in Destiny and the amount of fun we had together still stands out way above any other fun had.  His skill enabled us to sherpa a lot of Destiny folks.
I was able to have some closure and meet his family and let them see what a positive impact he had on the world outside his small community and home.  I just wanted to see I'm there with you in those feelings and have my condolences.
    Rest in Peace.
Sorry for your loss bro, I know the feeling me and my friend got the game when it was free on PS and we managed to get to platinum together, he passed away 2 years ago and I miss him a lot, I’m diamond now nearly champion so I like to think that he would be too if he was still here
Aw no man 😭 Hope you feel better man!😢😢 I Think My Eyes Are Sweating
You’re a good friend, I can only hope I have as good as friends as you are. My condolences. I’ve been playing RL since 2016 and I couldn’t imagine losing my best bud and 2s partner. God bless you I hope you find a small beam happiness for this bad time.
I am incredibly sorry for you
Hey, he had you till the end.
I normally roll my eyes at posts like this because circlejerk has ruined me, but something about the simplicity of this image hit me like a punch to the gut. I've been through this same thing before and you got me crying first thing in the morning. I feel for you bud. Game friendships are very real. I can't imagine knowing the person on the other side of the headset left this world.
Sorry for your loss. Don't forget, you can always visit your friend in your memories.
I played against you both not so long ago, I do remember. 

I'm sorry pal, sending some love from France.
Bro I'm so sorry for what happened. 
You can do it tho. 
If u need to talk or play we're all here for ya.
He was a gamer. We all know he'll already have respawned in heaven by now. You know he's in a good place now.
He’s stealing your boost in spirit
Scully I swear I’ve played with you before. My condolences :(
May he score in heaven!
Never thought car soccer would make me cry, but here we are
damn, that's actually savage xD
    Wagnesio would have laughed, bet. Im sorry your friend is gone.

    Although it was a joke, you took that well, I’d spam offensive content until I got a lifetime ban. I’m really sorry for what happened, I just really hope for you it wasn’t sudden and out of the blue. Death isn’t easy for me, so I really feel for you. Can’t imagine losing a buddy like that, there are no words any of us could say for that. Love that you shared though, takes courage. And support from the community y’all loved should be given.
bruh
Damn
    Shit
        Piss

Despite my laughter at this joke, that is actually a pretty touching photo, I gotta say.

You shouldn’t use a meme to pay respects to actual human beings
    I think it’s an easy and simple way to show someone you have empathy towards them. No harm or disrespect is meant by it so Idt it’s an issue
Sorry for your loss.
Assuming they’re actually dead. Not saying it isn’t true but it’s kind of wild that we let two screen shots of a video game and a few selected words make us feel some type of way. This could be fake for all we know but we choose to act like it’s real. Idk it’s weird I’m super high rn
It’s more like the support that he gets from other people. When someone close to you has died, I doubt karma is what you care about. But in a situation where you are upset and every upvote is someone supporting you, that could be a really nice thing.
    Really? you doubt karma is what he cares about? He literally went and made this stupid fucking photo for attention. Imagine if you posted on IG a photo of you and your friend with a recreation with you alone and sad. You're making the person's death about you, it's shitty and pathetic.
Hope you're alright
    Like I said, this was waaaaaaaay back in 2003-ish; the guild would go on for a number of years, even having an in-character wedding between 2 of it's leaders that an actual 'green name' GM showed up to officiate!  The groom, a Monk, challenged me(as a Beastlord) to a 1v1 duel(lots of battles and challenges were part of the party)...he won, but he admitted he was sweating bullets for a few moments late in the fight.  

Yeah, we were a pretty tight bunch....
What makes you think he's doing it for the likes? When someone you care for passes away reaching out and taking to others can be one of the best remedies. This is one of the major strengths of the Reddit community.
    [deleted]
        Everyone copes differently. Talking to strangers is often easier than talking to close ones. 

Especially when you can’t go and physically be with close ones.
            No bro... if your friend dies you don’t post it on rocket league Reddit ....
                If your friend dies you can do whatever you want if it helps you get through it. 

It’s not like he’s posting personal information.
This
its hard to believe but just in case it happened I wouldn't call it shit. Not only is it uncivil but it also could be extremely offensive.
Check ballchasing.com and calculated.gg! You can search for his steam id/gamertag and find any uploaded replays with him in them. There may not be many but it's worth a go
    Thanks for the tip.. Hope I can find some nice goals so I can make a little montage

        If you decide to make a montage, I'm still learning how to edit, but would be more than happy to edit it for free.
            I would also be open to taking a crack :)
                This is really cool, guys.  You got my view and like if it gets done.
                    Let’s see if he can manage to get the clips together first! Then we can let my noob editor skills loose ;P
        That sounds really fcking awesome actually, you should do it.

    Didn't know these sites existed, 

searched myself, 1 result from 2015 :)

Lost 5-1 :(
    Holy shit, I didn't know about this. Super cool.
        Yup this is actually So Dope
    Wow, I didn't know this existed and I appear in 388 of other peoples replays lol.
        Oh shit, you get demo’d in 247 of them!
Sorry to hear about your friend. :(


DM me, I may be able to locate some recent replay files.
    You didn't answer my DMs =(

Edit: guys, he answered :)
        Might take some time. Be patient, friend.
        Bruhh
        Feels bad man... Psyonix please
        hoping you found those replays buddy.
    Thank you.

I just sent you a DM
        Hey did you find the replays? u/rodrigoa1990
            Not really... Just the ones from calculated.gg and Devin sent me our last 10 matches, but tbh there wasn't much there.. 

And I'm still kinda awkward about asking his sister to go through his computer to send me the files so idk if I'll ever do that
psyonix, give this man his replay files!
I'm sure you could find a good ammount of replays on ballchasing.com. Some poeple auto-upload replays with bakkesmod so i usually find multiple replays of whoever i'm looking for.

Shit bro that’s deep wish I could say something that would help but I’m not good with words. To both of ur duo partners RIP 💔
Damn, that's tough.. I'm sorry for your loss

Virtual hugs to you too, mate
I also feel you guys. My only friend who played rocket league died of brain cancer a couple weeks ago.  He was my partner and we had the same rank. It was really hard to play ranked twos for the first time without him. People are always here for you and your never alone feel free to give me a message.
Rest In Peace.
Beyond the Grey Sky by 311 is a relevant song that, in a situation like yours, helped me process and deal. I hope it does the same for you. It's hard. I'm so sorry.

You guys should team up, it won't be the same, but at least you both are coming from a common place. Who knows what could happen.
I’m so sorry.
RIP to both of your duos partners. You made me cry....

When I go, I hope my brothers can play  whatever save files I have left. Something weird about gaming as a hobby is that we can back up stuff. My hockey stick doesn't have unfinished games, my guitar won't have any more of my own songs to write. But you bet your ass that there's still some golden bananas left to collect on DK isle.

I hope there's tears at every bongo drums lol
    Amen brother.
Gamers don't die. We respawn.
Rest in Peace.
Wagnesio would have laughed, bet. Im sorry your friend is gone.

Although it was a joke, you took that well, I’d spam offensive content until I got a lifetime ban. I’m really sorry for what happened, I just really hope for you it wasn’t sudden and out of the blue. Death isn’t easy for me, so I really feel for you. Can’t imagine losing a buddy like that, there are no words any of us could say for that. Love that you shared though, takes courage. And support from the community y’all loved should be given.
Shit

I think it’s an easy and simple way to show someone you have empathy towards them. No harm or disrespect is meant by it so Idt it’s an issue
Really? you doubt karma is what he cares about? He literally went and made this stupid fucking photo for attention. Imagine if you posted on IG a photo of you and your friend with a recreation with you alone and sad. You're making the person's death about you, it's shitty and pathetic.
Like I said, this was waaaaaaaay back in 2003-ish; the guild would go on for a number of years, even having an in-character wedding between 2 of it's leaders that an actual 'green name' GM showed up to officiate!  The groom, a Monk, challenged me(as a Beastlord) to a 1v1 duel(lots of battles and challenges were part of the party)...he won, but he admitted he was sweating bullets for a few moments late in the fight.  

Yeah, we were a pretty tight bunch....

    Everyone copes differently. Talking to strangers is often easier than talking to close ones. 

Especially when you can’t go and physically be with close ones.
        No bro... if your friend dies you don’t post it on rocket league Reddit ....
            If your friend dies you can do whatever you want if it helps you get through it. 

It’s not like he’s posting personal information.
Thanks for the tip.. Hope I can find some nice goals so I can make a little montage

        Calculated.gg has more recent matches.. I'll try to watch some of them tomorrow
