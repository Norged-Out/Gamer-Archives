        You jest, but you must have never heard of the 6 people with the title ‚ÄúRockets Engaged‚Äù as well as ‚ÄúRocket Wife‚Äù and ‚ÄúRocket Husband‚Äù
            So there you have it folks, 8 people, of the millions that play, have gotten laid.

There's an exception to every rule.  Except rule 1.
                NO EXCEPTUONS. Even and especially in RLCS and RLRS
            I play with my wife, we main hoops. How do i get these?
                With the Rocket husband and wife, they met each other on Rocket League and I‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs the case for the other ones. You could try tweeting at Psyonix or something tho
                You dont...

IF ANYONE WILL ASK THERE IS A FAQ:  
What is your rank: Super Sonic Legend 2  
Do you play with a controller? No I use my dad smartphone as a controller  
What is your platform? I'm playing on a 24,56 inch xbox smart screen monitor 

THATS ALL YOU NEED BYE   


  


  
WHAT A SAVE!!!!
    > Super Sonic Legend 2

You must be a smurf. This level of gameplay is usually found in Super Sonic Legend 3 & Knuckles
        That's the one where you plug the older cartridge into the top so you can play as super sonic legend knuckles in the earlier game!
        This one got me, well done
        [removed]
            It was like an add-on!
        I can do this and I‚Äôm only Tails 2
    Shit bruh I thought that shot was only possible using the Samsung smart fridge
        Do you use a controller?  
"No I use my dad"
            So you use nothing
    >	Do you play with a controller? No I use my dad
    Bro, *my dad smartphone*

I am clinically deceased
    I see, my problem is I've been playing on the ice maker on my Samsung fridge. Thanks for the tutorial.
    Can you help me set up my phone so I can use it as a controller?

        What a chad.
        Training pack?
    8k upvotes damn back when I saw this it only had like 50
Edit: 22k wow
    No hes super sayain lesbian.
OMG This is the problem with this subreddit. Obvious smurfs ruining the game just so they can hit montage clips in training!!121!!41!!!!!!!! You'd never be able to do that against players of your own skill! Stop ruining training experience for everyone! Why so many upvote?
    bro STFU!!!!!?!?!??! i bet you only got champ 3 in beach ball, real players like me are grand bronze in rumble
Wait a second... Something seems off here. You didn't fly away from the goal explosion!
    Because I was lagging that's all
        Holy shit, even lag can't stop you. Absolute beast.
    black hole goal explosion
500 hours of training finally paid off, huh?
    I just started tomorrow what are you talking about kid
        little 67 year old kid
            lmao
                I love your humor.
            Nice shot!
                What a save!
                    Okay.
Haters will say it's fake. This is absolutely stunning bro. Keep it up. Teach me too if you have the time someday.
When you took it up to the ceiling you even lagged inside the ball and you recovered it. This shots just pure art, nobody will come close to scoring something like this again for years, if ever.
Best goal ive seeb in years
Bro really thought he could post rlcs game 
play and get away with it ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

        I think the woosher became wooshed...
            This can‚Äôt be possible
You almost missed it ü§£
    Nah man I believe that's what's referred to as "Calculated."
        "faking"
This might just be the best and most clean shot i have ever seen, GJ OP.
    I went 1v1 with justin he left after i scored 17 goals on him in 30 seconds
        That's unbelievable. Do you have footage of that aswell?
            I will have no rn I'm in a 1v1 with musty grandpa
                hey, grandpa‚Äôs son here, can confirm grandpa got smacked
                    Username somehow checks out.
                        OMG thank you for making me read his name üòÇüòÇüòÇ
                Daaang alright, i'll take your word for it as that one clip i saw was just mesmerizing
This is why I stopped playing, everyone is so much better than me

Holy shit new mechanic! This is amazing
    Thank you, just call it "Dueling Dragons Ball Air Dribble Goal Into Net Freestyle Without Musty Flick" please
        I think "Super Ultra Dueling Dancing Dragons Ball Air Dribble Goal-Into-Net Supreme Freestyle Move No Musty Flick Flick" is more accurate
            I agree
                i just hate short forms

pleaae make it more elongated, thankyou
                    I like acronyms so let's call it shortly IMFUCKINGCUMMING
        With extra cheese
        Name of the shot has nothing to do with your username, should‚Äôve lined up the initials! 

I‚Äôll start calling it the ‚Äúsaid flick‚Äù and see if it catches on...
MOM GET THE CAMERA!
Have you considered going pro?
    NRG wanted to pick me up, but they would only play 150 grand it is not enough i said no
        You were clearly being low-balled for this unseen level of raw skill.
        if i were you, i might settle for something where grand is followed by billion atleast
            150 grand billion or no deal.
I thought it was fake but the goal explosion made me believe it

Guys I ran this back frame by frame and while op did a good job making this look real, he made one subtle error. At 0:04 you can hear the controller click 2 frames AFTER the input is made. Absolutely disgusting that someone would fake a shot like this and try to convince the people it‚Äôs real
    Geeze, I hope somebody got fired for that blunder.
    Wow how dare you accuse OP of faking it, ü§°. The reason why is that he's faster than the controller, he has so much raw skill and reaction time he makes the input _beforehand_. This is evidenced by the fact that he started playing tomorrow; mans is living in the future with his massive talent, and cock. The whole clip is one big hard read. Stop calling it fake just cuz your only a garbage gold player. Smh my head
What a god!
Bruh if only I had an ounce of your skill
This just made me realize a goal cosmetic that is just a shitty expanding png of an explosion would be amazing.
Didn't expect the Gifyourgame goal of the year to be won already.
that was so impressive I stood up from my chair and let out a primal roar while beating my chest

Amazing!!!

damb this is what skill is
That air dribble was insane! Was that an Elon Musk flip at the end too?!
That was soo clean! Teach me your ways bud
This sub is easily amused. This was done like 4 days ago by someone else lol

Guys, I don't play rocket league and I don't get this at all... Aren't you supposed to get the ball into the goal??
I wish I was close to being this good :(
Omg this is so clearly fake! Look, there‚Äôs no timer! He‚Äôs probably photoshopped it or something!!
Are you crinkling a Doritos bag for the boost? xD
Fake. Its reversed
I should've saved my fuckin award for this.

Edit: I got a free one appear i swear after I saw this
save some pussy for the rest of us dude, SHEESH
Is this audio from the girls slapping their asses after the dive
Guys guys, I just noticed something, the colour shift of the picture on the 468th frame is 73 digits off, this means this video might be fake, I know it's really hard to believe but it must somehow be fabricated using unknown to us technology
Calculated.
Stop re-uploading Musty's clips
Haters will say its photoshopped
I like how in your fantasy shot, you miss the ceiling shot then have to recover with an air dribble on the bounce.
my saw this and said lets sex
I need some coaching from this guy
And you are not a supersonic legend... I don‚Äôt get it
What sound is this?
Wow, for a second I thought it's video edit, but now I see it's all true, this shot was amazing!
What an awesome shot.
Montage when?
That goal explosion was awesome
Savage!

Only thing better than OP's clip is that this comment got like half a dozen people to take the bait, hook, line, and sinker

                Did you delete your last comment or something?  Something about my ego or some shit.

Anyway, that‚Äôs bullshit my guy. You were the one who talked about karma with my downvotes, to which then I have the right to defend myself from your unnecessary attack. 

Just another guy on reddit who couldnt handle a joke, and when he got called out on it, didn‚Äôt just firm it. All I did was sarcastically go along with the giving af about karma and then tell you karma dont mean shit. 

If im saying i have 47k karma and then karma not meaning shit it aint so egotistical lol ive literally degraded it. 

Anyway, please don‚Äôt k/ll yourself, i saw that about k/lling urself and IQ. But idk ur comment aint there but saw the notification ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
                    Wait a minute I thought you didn‚Äôt care?!? What happened to that lol, sure looks like you care. (Thank you for your concern about me killing myself tho)
                        What the actual fuck are you talking about now? Did I miss something in that hidden comment or something?
                            Uhh no you were saying that you had a lot of karma and that you didn‚Äôt care about what I was saying
                                I. Didn‚Äôt say i didnt care about what ur saying, not that is untrue, i like getting hate actually. 

But i didnt say i didnt care about what ur saying, ive said i dont care about getting downvoted. Here look, ill downvote my own comments in this comment thread
                                    Tbh I‚Äôve lost ya idk wtf your talking about bud, and idk why you like getting hate but alright pal you do you.
                It‚Äôs ok, I‚Äôll just look at my 47k karma...

Since apparently i give a fuck lmfao you gaf? Dude it dont mean shit.

Why is there a picture of a ball... instead of a ball... in the middle of the screen??
    He‚Äôs a hacker obviously he can do that in the in game files
        Ok thanks for the sarcasm, But why?  How does this improve the video..??
            It shows how skilled he is because the ball didnt roll
                I feel like I should be getting whooshed
Cringe
It‚Äôs funny the hate I get in here when I post a tik tok with creds. But someone stealing an idea from tik tok gets 25k upvotes. Okay!
I'd spend a little less time playing this and a little more time learning to write English.
    Dude you hear that? That‚Äôs the sound of no one asking
Training package pls
Wow you are so good ;)
Is this what the next evolution of mankind looks like?
This man straight levitated the Ball. Clearly only doable at ssl3 atleast
Nasty

When I saw that Rocket League had made the front page of r/all for a shot clip instead of something stupid Epic did, my hopes were as high as could be. I was *not* disappointed! Nice shot!
That is some next level skill right there!! You gotta be using hacks or something. There's no way!
Incredible. What chair do you use???bet that's the secret
Well you are right. I don‚Äôt think anyone has done this before you
mofo I had the same idea due to my obvious suckiness lol good job also Nice shot!

Nice shot!

Nice shot!
If this is someone furiously crunching a water bottle I'm gonna die of laughter
Brilliant
I think it's fake, in the bakkes mod settings you can slow down freeplay... Maybe it was done that way
I fuckin love this sub
NICE SHOT! SIICK! WHAT A SAVE! SIIIICK!!! WOW!
Haters will say its fake! 

Nice 1 man!!
Can you please coach me?

Nice shot!
Bruh come on. It was a good try, honestly, but there's a couple frames around 3 and 6 seconds in where you can tell its shopped
I‚Äôm very confused as in what he did that was all that. The game looks like a damn power point.
Pogcha-
I had already watched a couple of hours ago. Tired, scrolling on mobile sort of in between posts reading the one above and my brain goes ‚ÄúDamn, that‚Äôs some good ball control.‚Äù
How can one acquire this power?
Contest it so your opponent have 0
I never saw something like this, haters gonna say thats fake.
I'm sick of these smurfs doing this in my ranked games!
Haters will say its fake
Why does it sound like a lego commercial
So you invented a new trick. How are you going to name it?
How

Get this guy a team.
I did this once but the camera wasn‚Äôt on /s
MADDDD SHOT
I'm here from r/all so genuinely asking what's the buzz here? All I see is a remote control car driving into a goalmouth. What am I missing?
This is dumb af. I love it.
IT IS TOO GOOD! I'll never be that good.  The ball control is off the charts.
Calculated
Nice shot
Wow, ur the best take my upvote and award and job and bank account wow

NRG wanted to pick me up, but they would only play 150 grand it is not enough i said no
    You were clearly being low-balled for this unseen level of raw skill.
    if i were you, i might settle for something where grand is followed by billion atleast
        150 grand billion or no deal.

Geeze, I hope somebody got fired for that blunder.
Wow how dare you accuse OP of faking it, ü§°. The reason why is that he's faster than the controller, he has so much raw skill and reaction time he makes the input _beforehand_. This is evidenced by the fact that he started playing tomorrow; mans is living in the future with his massive talent, and cock. The whole clip is one big hard read. Stop calling it fake just cuz your only a garbage gold player. Smh my head
obviously a joke
No shit

            Did you delete your last comment or something?  Something about my ego or some shit.

Anyway, that‚Äôs bullshit my guy. You were the one who talked about karma with my downvotes, to which then I have the right to defend myself from your unnecessary attack. 

Just another guy on reddit who couldnt handle a joke, and when he got called out on it, didn‚Äôt just firm it. All I did was sarcastically go along with the giving af about karma and then tell you karma dont mean shit. 

If im saying i have 47k karma and then karma not meaning shit it aint so egotistical lol ive literally degraded it. 

Anyway, please don‚Äôt k/ll yourself, i saw that about k/lling urself and IQ. But idk ur comment aint there but saw the notification ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
                Wait a minute I thought you didn‚Äôt care?!? What happened to that lol, sure looks like you care. (Thank you for your concern about me killing myself tho)
                    What the actual fuck are you talking about now? Did I miss something in that hidden comment or something?
                        Uhh no you were saying that you had a lot of karma and that you didn‚Äôt care about what I was saying
                            I. Didn‚Äôt say i didnt care about what ur saying, not that is untrue, i like getting hate actually. 

But i didnt say i didnt care about what ur saying, ive said i dont care about getting downvoted. Here look, ill downvote my own comments in this comment thread
                                Tbh I‚Äôve lost ya idk wtf your talking about bud, and idk why you like getting hate but alright pal you do you.
            It‚Äôs ok, I‚Äôll just look at my 47k karma...

Since apparently i give a fuck lmfao you gaf? Dude it dont mean shit.

if i were you, i might settle for something where grand is followed by billion atleast
    150 grand billion or no deal.
i think you did too.
I can do this without playing the game
    cap, i know someone who can do it without existing
        my dad?
            no, my girlfriend

            referring to me bruv?
                nah the other guy

            humour isn't subjective anymore guys, we can't laugh at anything unless u/BumblebeeJealous says so üòøüòøüòø
Ur fake too
    u/umissedthejokeagain
        Ur still fake
I just scrolled to bottom of comments list to see if i actually find comments like this and i did. Not surprised
    Just sort by controversial no need to scroll to the bottom lmao
    Lol I'm a grand champion put some respect on my name
        you don‚Äôt get any for being stupid lmao
        dang. im gold, but at least I enjoy having fun messing around and not trying as hard as possible
        Lmao no one cares
Of course he's kidding lmao

Only thing better than OP's clip is that this comment got like half a dozen people to take the bait, hook, line, and sinker
    I don't think he is
u/umissedthejoke
Pretty sure you‚Äôre the one who got the woosh my guy. My comment was a joke.
    Lol, ok tell that to the 35 downvotes ‚Äúmy guy‚Äù
        Did you delete your last comment or something?  Something about my ego or some shit.

Anyway, that‚Äôs bullshit my guy. You were the one who talked about karma with my downvotes, to which then I have the right to defend myself from your unnecessary attack. 

Just another guy on reddit who couldnt handle a joke, and when he got called out on it, didn‚Äôt just firm it. All I did was sarcastically go along with the giving af about karma and then tell you karma dont mean shit. 

If im saying i have 47k karma and then karma not meaning shit it aint so egotistical lol ive literally degraded it. 

Anyway, please don‚Äôt k/ll yourself, i saw that about k/lling urself and IQ. But idk ur comment aint there but saw the notification ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
            Wait a minute I thought you didn‚Äôt care?!? What happened to that lol, sure looks like you care. (Thank you for your concern about me killing myself tho)

                    Uhh no you were saying that you had a lot of karma and that you didn‚Äôt care about what I was saying
                        I. Didn‚Äôt say i didnt care about what ur saying, not that is untrue, i like getting hate actually. 

But i didnt say i didnt care about what ur saying, ive said i dont care about getting downvoted. Here look, ill downvote my own comments in this comment thread
                            Tbh I‚Äôve lost ya idk wtf your talking about bud, and idk why you like getting hate but alright pal you do you.
        It‚Äôs ok, I‚Äôll just look at my 47k karma...
