[[This pirate bean tried to ruin my slime climb so I ruined his win. You get what you deserve.]]





*Pirate tries to murder innocent beans for the lols in slime climb*

<McSkillet will remember this>

On a serious note, I wonder what the winner was thinking?  Was he aware of the revenge arc unfolding behind him that contributed to his success?  Was that his first crown?  Will the pirate return?  So many questions...
    I demand an entire series on Netflix following these three characters and their exciting journeys.
        Starring Tobey Maguire and Samuel L Jackson
            and then a reboot movie around ten movies later, with skateboarding involving a skateboard glued to the actors feet
                Is this a reference I don't understand or are you just some comedic genius?
                    There's a video of Tony Hawk criticising skating in movies and Spiderman 3 featured. He wasn't impressed with the fake skating. I had recently watched it.
        Can My Little league fall guy be a side character?
            Batty McBean,  the Bean Mafia enforcer who goes yard on kneecaps.
                YES.
        So, which character is just gonna be gay for their development?

Edit: I know y’all didn’t just get salty for a running joke about Netflix...
            *Wolves howl in the distance*
            The winner
            ...who got salty?
                When I first posted that, it was at -11 downvotes lmao
                    Gotcha, my whole life is spent in the downvote
                        You merely adopted the downvote...
                    how about they downvote my reply instead, i’ll take it for you
                        Come u/blves_, this is no place to die
                            they aren’t downvoting me it’s not working
                                Cause you don’t deserve it friend
                                    how can i make myself deserve it
            I think that was funny, and I am gay

                You seem to be confusing Netflix with Nutflix.
                Mad
            I asume at first you got downvoted, because you know, feminists. The funny thing is how some people get so butthirt about their "fights" and campaigns and seem to believe that being gay/black/trans makes you a so much better and more interesting person when in some cases seems to be just what describes them and their only trait
                People don't believe being gay black or trans makes you more interesting. Its just representation in media for groups who haven't had much at all outside of joke side characters and grave fillers.
                What? This has nothing to do with feminists lmao

It’s just a joke about Netflix writers
        Fall guys - Story mode
    Don't wanna spoil too much, but the pirate has a REALLY nice redemption arc in the Jump Rope Canyon story arc. Should check it out.
        I really started feeling bad for him once >!he got that other hand chopped off.!<
            He deserved it for what he did at the block party.
                Come on man you know the Furries made him do it, SMHmy head
            Fuck!!! I knew it was a spoiler and I read it anyway! Fuck fuck fuck!
        Didnt expect to see a fellow ProZD fan here lol
        YOU GAVE ME A MAP IDEA

PIRATE BEAN ACTED DAMICKEY SO NOW GOOGO AND ALEXANDER CLAMBEAN MUST FIIIIIIGHT

I hope they don't hit each other too hard...
            "Gah, we're really in for it now Gobean."


"Mraahh!"
    "Thanks for the free crown, morons"
    Topology pigeon is right next to him from 0:11 to 0:16
    Find out in the next episode of battle of the beans!
    Maybe I should message him and ask some follow up questions. Now I want to know what he was thinking.
        Based on their username, I’d think it was an old dad who just won their first game
        Did you ever win before?
    It’s moments like this that I I wish we could keep track of the players you’re up against.  You could have “rivals” that if you end up playing against, you get double XP or something if you beat them!
    All will be revealed on the next episode of...
    This demands a season 2
    Someone message the winner, we must know.

    If you don’t do this is slime climb you’re making the win harder for yourself. Cull that herd 

Also it’s fun as fuck to boop people off the beam
        Subjective. 

I don't have fun doing such things, but you do you, no shade.
This game should be renamed Karma Guys.
    [deleted]
        Man, how many people here hate griefers, but then get excited when Alpharad or some other YouTuber does that exact thing? Why hate people for playing the game?
        Ok tryhard
            If I wanted to play mini games without potential sabotage from other players I’d play wii sports
        Beast
        play to win
        What a douche
        lol the downvotes are hillarious, some of you take this game way too seriously
            This happens on every game subreddit. People playing the game in a way the masses deem wrong get shit on constantly so everybody can have some faux sense of being a good person
        Absolute chad. Keep it up king.
        No they don’t. I can tell you’re pissed
            I can tell you're pissed.

Actually I can't because it's reddit and I don't know you.
                Good man. Stay safe.
        My first win was result of me eliminating a lot of people in slime climb, which resulted in a 4 man hex a gone.

  


Keep it up brother

Imagine if the third person missed the crown jump and the pirate won after all of that.
    And he almost did Lol
    The only time I was close to winning I got up there and  jumped but landed on the conveyor. I didn’t even know I could miss that jump since it was my first and only time
        [removed]
            I literally never knew this. The amount of the times where I made it to the last level only to just bump my head onto the crown...
                It’s says it during the loading screen AND reminds you at the top of your screen in game to grab the crown using R2
            i lost what would have been my first win just because i didn’t know u have to grab it
            I got a win 2 days ago because 4 people in front of me didn't grab the crown when they jumped at it...
            I really don't understand this requirement. It doesn't up the skill level. It's just a new mechanic introduced in a loading screen and in small text up in the corner. It's a very strange design decision.
                It means you can't dive for the crown (since you can't grab while diving), so it does slightly change the game.
                    I made a dive for it my first and, to this day, only time making it up there before anyone else, and I bonked my head.

Just realized why I didn't win then.
                        I dived too! RIP
                    The dive wouldn't always be the best option anyway since it lowers your character's collision box, and thus would prevent you from touching the crown if it's a bit too high, whereas a normal jump would reach it.

Removing the need to grab would add the need to decide whether you dive or jump, and also would fix all the bugs related to grabbing the crown (there are a lot). IMO it's a win-win. It's an arbitrary requirement that only steals wins from new players anyway.
                    I’ve head butted the crown twice now I never knew you couldn’t dive and grab
                    Wait what? That explains all the fall mountain losses I’ve had lol
                Idk it feels pretty logical. Bean that gets his hands to the final object first wins. If getting to the top would be the only thing that matters it would just be a finish line.
                I think they did it for publicity. It's funny to watch someone go for their first win, and not realize they need to grab.
            No shit? You just saved me so many last games
    I expect we'd be getting a very different Reddit post from a different bean.
I was shocked that with three players left it didn’t make a 2v1 soccer game
    Bruh I made the top 10 five times last night and 4/5 times it was fall ball. Can’t stand that game mode
        I got to the top 10 about 7 times yesterday and every s i n g l e time it was tip toe. I’m going to commit war crimes
            A tip for tip toe if you are on pc, if you have a bug where you slide around a lot on the tiles, turn off your vsync. Works wonders.
                Wasn't there a patch for that physics bug?
                    Idk
        >4/5 times it was fall ball

&#x200B;

I feel like 9 of the 10 players are made out of marsh mellows and one guy is a brick unit that smashes the ball... One day there will be a no team mode and we shall rejoice.
            A solo mode only option is the one thing this games needs most tbh.


Don't remove the modes but don't force me to play them when I don't want to.
        Why?  That game mode almost always feels like a skill based competition, rather than a luck based one, to me.
            Coming on this sub for the first time was so sad, fall ball is the BEST and everyone hates it. Any team games with balls are my favorite for sure
                The problem is one team is always uneven and gets fucked because of it
                    I totally get that
                        [deleted]
                            Dude, I hit the ball and my guy just falls over... I don't like anh of the ball games besides Rock 'N' Roll
                The uneven nature get me more than my feelings for the game. If there is an uneven number dont do a team game
            Because whether or not I get skilled team mates is the lucky part
                That's...every game ever though, right?
                    No? Not the solo games, or games where you can choose your team.
        If it makes you feel any better, they are releasing a patch sometime this week to fix uneven teams
        I have legit played Tip Toe over 20 games in a row the last couple of days. I'm so over that stupid game mode.
        I got fucking uneven team fall ball I shit you not 15 times in a row when it should have just gone to a finale. It's long boring team based and frustrating. Fuck fall ball, that game mode needs to be taken out back and shot

Fuck Royal fumble too
        Cry me a riiiver
    3 players left?!?!?

Hoarders, take it or leave it.
        you know, that would actually be funnier than a 4v5 fall ball
    Seriously the final game is always a teambased one if the numbers are uneven.
    I had a 10v10 fall ball last night but it might as well have been 3v17 by my team either hitting the ball in our own goal or just completely missing it
    oooh, salty
        Absolutely! Luckily Fall Guys is such a happy little fun game I don't get too salty at least for too long.
I'm this kind of petty , I tip my hat to you !
    I’ve been both people depending on my mood haha
Serves him well hahaha gg
I love revenge in this game, dawg. It's more satisfying than in GTA
    **\*Pirate bean has been obliderated by the Orbital cannon\***
    Getting justice against douche nozzles like this is the most satisfying thing
I wish I got a 3 man final
    PS4
*It’s not about winning,*

*It’s about sending a message*
The final round with only 3 beans? I went to the final once and it was like 15-17 guys..
    What you don’t love a cluster fuck for fall mountain?
        I had a 17 man Hex-a-gone.

IT. WAS. GLORIOUS.
            18 was the most I've played. It's a complete no skill ultra shit show. 


Been hoping to have it again ever since.
    I once got into a final with only one other player left. Of course we played Royal Fumble
Justice has been SERVED!!!!!!
Nice lol
you can tell that this whole sub needed this
Moral of the story: Dont be a toxic bean or P-body will ruin your life.
    The thing is the pirate would’ve probably bean (see what I did there) salty at the end even though he was doing it to other people.
        It's not the same thing. 

Trying to eliminate as many players as you can in Slime climb is fine. 


What OP did wasn't fine, giving up your own chances of winning so you can grief someone isn't cool. OP was just petty and a lot more toxic than the pirate for basically no reason and i absolutly don't understand why people upvote this post. It would be completly different story if OP killed him in slime climb, that would be funny.
            LOL so its OK to grief others as long as you win, but you can't grief others at your own expense?  Get real.

I have far more fun griefing griefers than going for the win (and more success).  I've gone so far as to hold on to griefers on that block dodging map so we both get pushed off.  How is that any worse than just pushing him off?  Does it take less skill to sacrifice myself?  Sure.  Is it fair.  Of course it is.  Its hilarious that griefers have a code of honor about griefing.
                There are obviously multiple levels of griefing and some are more ok than others, don't know what's so hard to understand. Griefing doesn't have to necessarily be a bad thing and can be fun.

Giving up your chances of winning because you want to target grief someone is so much worse than pushing random people because you want to eliminate them.
                    Fair enough.  However, those who seek to purposely eliminate others can't possible expect that those other players will not be upset and seek revenge.
                        That's true, you will make other players angry and angry people aren't usually very rational.

I just think behavior like in this clip shouldn't be glorified, you are not some saint who killed evil, you got mad and did something stupid. Someone pushed you? Push him back, don't try to completly destroy him no matter the costs.
            I mean, if he griefed, he can get griefed too
            I have a problem with the slime Climb beam blocking because all it does is eliminate beans that spawned in the back. It’s not like the blocker was better, they spawned in an advantageous spot.
                I am not exactly sure how it works, but aren't spawns based on previous rounds?
                    No they’re random
            Trying to eliminate players in races IS griefing. 🤦‍♂️
                Griefing doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing. 

Pushing random people with intended mechanic is good griefing, it's just a bit of fun. Some levels would be very boring without griefing, Roll Out for example.

Giving up your chances of winning because you want to completly destroy 1 person is bad and toxic.
                    The issue here is that you're drawing the line between what is griefing to you and what isn't and that's an arguable line and most people don't see it as such.

You cannot simply say, "well, this griefing is okay and this one isn't" because griefing is griefing. 

Also, who's to say that the person gave up his chances? For the majority of the race, he was straight behind him for a potential chance to win if the hammers or balls hit Pirate any harder.

As you said, "it's just a bit of fun". If you're going to grief, you have zero right to complain about getting griefed back, regardless of whether or not its final game.
                        No, the issue is you are not capable of thinking about griefing as something not horrible.

If you are still trying to win I don't care what you do, that's it. I am not trying to set some hypothetical line between good griefing and bad griefing, it's extremly simple. If you make it your life mission to destroy someone because he pushed you once, you are dumb. If everyone stopped griefing, this game would be boring. Some levels like Roll out wouldn't be nearly as fun as they are now.


And please don't even try to argue player in this clip was trying to win, he very obviously wasn't, he literally waited for that pirate every time he was ahead of him.
                            > No, the issue is you are not capable of thinking about griefing as something not horrible.

No, I never implied that. The logic is that if you grief someone, expect to be griefed back. It's that simple. It seems you're the one that isn't capable of grasping that.

This has no merit on whether or not its strategic or causing yourself the loss.
                                Again, you completly ignore my point. You can't just say griefing Is griefing, it doesn't work like that, just because it's called griefing doesn't mean it's the same thing.

I wouldn't expect you to steal my phone because i stole your chicken wing. I would expect you to steal my chicken nugget. You are basically saying I should expect you to steal everything because i stole from you and it's fine because stealing is stealing.

It's the same with griefing, I would expect you to try to push me after I pushed you, I wouldnt expect to make an enemy for life because i pushed you. 

Of course it's not forbbiden, people can do that, but it's very unreasonable toxic behavior and shouldn't be glorified like people do in this post.
                                    > I wouldn't expect you to steal my phone because i stole your chicken wing. I would expect you to steal my chicken nugget. 

Well, that's where you're wrong. You shouldn't expect someone to do you wrong at the same level because you did them wrong.

That's like saying I shouldn't expect you to steal -anything- from me, and you did, so therefore, don't expect me to steal whatever equivalent you have because -you- cause the neutrality to tip in the first place. That logic is linear to the overall toxicity.
            Shouldn't be downvoted. Slime climb eliminating is all fun and games but targeted griefing is totally uncalled for
                You forgot the /s

I always target the asshat and I've seen a few more people do the same.  The community is allowed to retaliate in any way they see fit.  You want to grief?  I want to make Fall Guys a place of peace and harmony.
                    We all want a positive gaming community and that is what we're steering towards but the grab function exists to mess around with others. It's a core gameplay mechanic. I can't stop anyone from being a dickhead and petty towards someone who uses this mechanic but it shouldn't be praised.

EDIT: Thanks for the downvotes guys. Very constructive.
    Using game mechanics to help win an individual game isn't toxic lol.

Do you think grab exists primarily for hugs?
        "Help Win" is not the correct way to say it btw. You can win Slime Climb without eliminating the other competition. That's what he was doing.

&#x200B;

However, if you do eliminate the other competition, expect other beans to be fucking pissed at you. Yes, valid strategy to thin out the herd, but you're still an asshole. Slime Climb is hard enough without pirate beans.
            How did it not help him? Isn't it a lot easier to win Fall mountain or other final rounds with 3 people than it is with 10 people?
                ChainChump said

> Using game mechanics to help win an individual game isn't toxic lol. 

Eliminating people doesn't help you win the individual game of Slime Climb. You can win Slime Climb by focusing on yourself.   


It is a valid strategy for thinning the herd but it doesn't guarantee your victory.
                    People want to act like there's no social aspect to this game, but that's impossible for any game where humans interact. If you want to focus on ensuring failure in others in order to increase your odds, that is an acceptable strategy. It's not morally wrong or anything. But you're gonna want to enter revenge into your calculus of how the game is gonna go.
                        Live by the grab, die by the grab.
            If you get mad at people killing you in fall guys, that’s just silly
                It's a valid strategy. Doesn't mean I don't love to see them get taken out the same way they took out others or myself.
                    Live by the sword die by the sword
                        Live by the yeet, die by the yeet.
                I don't get mad. I get even.
            People are acting like this game isn't a battle royale lol
    How was the Pirate being toxic? It's a competition
        Bruh this isn’t a sweaty game
        Just because it's a competition doesn't mean someone can't be toxic. The pirate was standing in the one spot on the whole map that can block everyone else and cause them to die, just so he could eliminate all of them. It might be part of the game, but it is definitely toxic.
            i agree, its part of the game and okay do it if you wanna that much, but dont expect people to treat you nice after you're doing this.
            You guys are hilarious lol. It's all part of the fun. You're not MLG Pro gamers.
                Wouldn’t the pirates attempt to block everyone from winning be the actual MLG move? Everyone else just wants to actually play the game.
                    The dude stopped for a few seconds. Relax. You guys are calling him a toxic gamer like he's spewing racist threats and aimbotting. I can't believe how bent out of shape you're all being over this.
                    Dude it’s a game where you play as a bean and run obstacles. They added grab as a fun mechanic. The point of the game is to have fun.
                        Some of us don’t have a lot of time to play. If I can only afford an hour of game time a day I want to spend it actually playing the game.
            Not to mention how toxic everyone else is for trying to win the game. We really should restart concentration camps for people like that
EDIT: you people are beyond help
                What the fuck is wrong with you?
        It's a race. Just go cross the finish line. You don't see people in the Olympics trying to trip each other. The anonymity of the internet brings out peoples true personalities.
            Why do you think they added the mechanic? It’s fun. It’s suppose to the fun.
                I just think it's funny that people get so bent out of shape over a game mechanic. Yeah I get why you dont like it it's not exactly fun to be on the receiving end of a grab that eliminates you but for some people it's part of the fun.  People are so desperate to have their cake and eat it too. By this subs definition of toxic, targeting the losing team in Egg Scramble is probably toxic as well but I never see anyone play any other way. Its just a silly game get over it.
                    100 percent on board. It’s supposed to be a silly, fun game. Plus you get sweet karma vids lol. I guarantee that the person who was who grabbing in the OP post wasn’t upset they lost lol.
You are doing gods work
This happened to me today. I ended up being pushed into the slime by some guy. Next round he got fucked over on a team game so I was satisfied.
You are a hero we need but don’t deserve.

    I always figured it as a unspoken rule that you are allowed to "play dirty", but accept the risk that others may justifiably seek retribution against you.
        the problem with this is people not minding their own business and gang up on YOU because they walk over and see you knocking XYZ over a cliff and think you are the aggressor.
        thats how i play this game, i like to screw over people knowing that if they survive they might give everything up just for revenge, i really don't know why people get so mad over this, i am just playing the game in my own way, i am not hacking or anything
            Yep, I die plenty of times trying to be a dick. It's part of the fun.
                Yes! I will be in stitches from trying to fuck some one over and end up sending myself into oblivion. And then i get right back into another game a minute later. 

There are a lot of babies on this thread through. I'm definitely going to be grabbing players more often. 

Its a party game, with a grab mechanic, which is fun. Stop trying to make everything a PVE game. A little pvp makes everything better.
                    My biggest attitude shift has been in the game Roll Out. I used to just mind my business and go back and forth. It would be very rare if I didn't qualify but now I run around like an ass trying to shove people off. This has probably doubled my chances of being eliminated but it's now chaotic fun and a course I enjoy rather than it being a chore.
                        It also has doubled your fun i bet. The games people just run back and forth and try not to fall off the platform is too many. The grabbing on that stage adds a ton of fun.
                            Yep, I usually go dizzy trying to adjust the camera though. That's usually how I fall through.
Why is everyone mad at OP? Pirate bean wasn’t “just trying to win”.  He intentionally stood on the beam to be an asshole and then waited at the finish line to fuck with people. He got what he deserved.
    People automatically assumed pirate bean was acting that way purely out of competitive spirit, without even considering the possibility he just wanted to be a dick to the people behind him.
        I think him waiting at the finish line proves he was trying to troll.  I don’t feel bad at all for him.
            You can knock people off at the end too. Notice how many people they had in their fall mountain, and why. Now ask yourself if the Pirate gave himself better odds to win.
                He absolutely did and I have no problem with it.  I just find it annoying when I’m on the receiving end and if you play like that you can’t be surprised when someone sabotages your win.
Good thing there's no voice chat in game lmaoo
Good gamer, good!
The absolute dedication in preventing him from coming first. I could feel the vengeance. Love it!
Ahhh the sweet sound of a controller breaking from being thrown across the room could be heard from the pirates side.
It was the right thing to do
Good fucking job dude!! Good fucking job
Pirates of the fallribbean
    Bloody *pirates!*
moral of the story: don't start no shit and there won't be none
*RELENTLESS, WITHOUT MERCY*
Task failed successfully
Im really bored can someone please play fall guys with me
    No.
        ok :(
I’m so glad to see this get the recognition it deserves! I’m the red&green dumbass that got myself killed at 0:30, but stayed to see pirate lose. Could not have gone better.
The hero we deserve
I thought only me was petty enough to do shit like this xD
There's nothing more terrifying than a person whose mission is Vengeance.
P-Body: “You almost took everything from me.”

Pirate: “I don’t even know who you are.”
Giving up your own chance at winning to make sure a villain doesn't win; a truly heroic action. I'm going to pretend like the pirate was 1 win off getting the infallible trophy too, to make this even juicier.
I like how you get fall mountain with 3 people and I'm over here consistently playing 7 person fall ball
    Because the Pirate eliminated everyone in climb climb. Extremely strategic.
You live by the grab you die by the grab.
If I had an award, I would give it to you. Take this comment and upvote. 🙏
    Instead send the money to people in need instead of a dude "sticking it to the man" on Reddit
        Where do you donate your money?
            Red cross
        I do do that instead. Instead, it's called Watsi and it crowd funds healthcare for people around the world. Instead of them staying sick they get help.
The Lord's work
Wait, you got a... 3 person fall mountain? I don't think I've ever seen a lobby with less than like 7 for final, average like 15.

Anyways haha good day to be pigeonbutt.
    That's slime climb for you. I won one of my first games of royal fumble cause slime climb killed everyone except me and another bean and I spawned with the tail. I was ecstatic but immediately knew it was unfair.
        I'm super envious, haha, slime is my absolute favorite, but it never trims the numbers quite that well in my lobbies. Maybe one day.

Also yeah rough day for the other person there...
        I have never seen a single digit slimb climb. its usually something like 21 people and 17 make it through with 2-3 of the knockouts being from griefers. Are you on PS4?
Damn 3 people in finals crazy
    Same thing happened to me a few days ago but it was royal fumble and my latency fucked me
        I hate the hit box ones. Their net code is meh
            It doesn’t help that my internet is garbage either
You are a man of honor. Fucking prick got what he deserved.
What outfit is that? It’s super cool
    It's the P-Body top with the aquarium lower half.
*Arrgh*
I can’t even get a single win, so lucky i want that skin.
I hate slime climb and fall mountain never finished that stupid level
    Da Fuck? Slime climb is the best level. Tho I can agree with mountain fall being stupid.
        I hate it cuz I never won.  The level design is very good it's just sooo hard for me I rage quit the game.
            Lol yes it's hard but ngl even tho it's hard it's the best map.
It’s not about the crown, it’s about sending a message
A lot of people here are upset that actions have consequences
Respect. 😎
For me I only have bullet skins do that on slime climb.
I’m so pissed I haven’t gotten the game yet and I missed a portal skin
Weirdo
This prettiness fuel my rage, well done OP.
Not all Heroes wear capes
whats with that weird cut? is that just a different game entirely wtf?
Good work.

My friends and I are out here doing the same in our games. Here's to justice.
lmao
This reminds me of Pirates of the Caribbean and the notorious Captain Jack Sparrow
Do you think he got one of those recalled game keys. A pirated copy?
The Fall of Guys Season 1 Cast:

Madhat (Pirate Bean): a raw skill player that can compete with the best. His rough upbringing has caused him to be callous and sly, however, leading to him being rejected by the elite racers.

Mr. Bot (main robot): a fall guy who built his reputation through hard work and is highly touted. Unfortunately his temper had led him to throw races in the past, leading to trouble with the fall mafia as well as the elite racers of which he is a member. Has a tragic marriage arc.

The Kid (winning robot): a semi talented racer that is now all over headlines based on his questionable win. His inexperience causes him to fall victim to the fall mafia’s ploys. 

Bullet King (not shown): elected leaders of the elite racers and wealthy due to his business the gungeon. He has the most wins in fall history and constantly preaches the old ways of honor and respect to other racers, even as the game continues to turn more viscous.

Billy Bean slugger (not shown): a rising fall guy with questionable wins. Many have investigated into strange instances happening in races, unfortunately all these investigations quickly and abruptly end. (Has a hatred competition arc)
A soul for a soul is see...
Haha sweet sweet vengeance
^murray
Pirate gets interviewed in 2048:

Interviewer: So how did that game between you and the robot change your life?

Pirate: I lost everything after that game. Pirate wife left me for the winner and I had to start a new life somewhere else. Been a model citizen ever since.
at least he wasn't a hacker
As a fellow pirate bean, we do not condone this brand actions and think he should walk the plank
TIL there can be end rounds with only 3 players.
    Usually after a hellacious round of slime climb.
A small price to pay for salvation
Would've been hilarious to see the pigeon fail the jump
Winning is shit. Crowns are shit. _All I want is revenge._
This should serve as a lesson to all the grabbers in the world. Sure grabbing has its perks, but the one thing that everyone forgets is that it's also a great way to make enemies that could screw you over later.

    You trying to repost without my permission? How dare you?! These internet points are my life I won't let you take this from me! /s
Just my personal opinion but I think this sets a bad example. I get that "winning isn't everything" but ultimately the goal of the game is to win. What the pirate was doing is part of trying to win.

Imagine if you did this in a team game, like scoring own goals in fall ball. No way is this getting so many upvotes. "But you're ruining it for everyone else who just wants to play." ... So exactly like this then? The pirate is just playing, you're throwing, it's two different things.

I don't think there's a "lesson to be learnt" or that this is a good thing, if it's going to spread this sort of throwing. Maybe it's not really that big a deal I guess.
    Some people would say the goal of the game is to have fun, and pirate was taking that away from people. So the punishment fits the crime
        Does trying to win inherently take away fun from the game? I've been knocked out plenty of times and taken it in good fun, it's part of the game. But I see throwing as strictly salty and/or counter fun. OP says people are taking the game too seriously, but I'd say it's the other way round.
            It does if you take away the fun from other people. In general, it's not fun when you are immobilized, in any fashion, whether by gameplay mechanic or other player. You are free to do it but you should also accept the consequences of those actions.

Also, I'd say the pirate is exploiting a design flaw in the level. It's the only place in the whole game where one person can bottleneck a level from everyone else. There really isn't a good way around it and the situation is very unbalanced towards the player camping that spot.
                >It does if you take away the fun from other people. In general, it's not fun when you are immobilized, in any fashion, whether by gameplay mechanic or other player. You are free to do it but you should also accept the consequences of those actions.

Nonetheless it's part of the game though. If you weren't meant to be able to grab/block people it wouldn't be there? I think people are ready to accept the consequences, because you can easily get punished for doing any of these things. But I think throwing is a step too far.

&#x200B;

>Also, I'd say the pirate is exploiting a design flaw in the level. It's the only place in the whole game where one person can bottleneck a level from everyone else. There really isn't a good way around it and the situation is very unbalanced towards the player camping that spot.

It's not that hard to get around it though. I'd say the flaw is in the start more so than that part, because at least if it was skill alone that got you there first that'd be better. But the developers haven't really said anything against this part, and even embraced the memes.
                    Sure, it's part of the game, but that doesn't necessarily means it's a good thing. If a large number of people don't enjoy it then, maybe it is worth taking another look at it. I'd say one way to make it more balanced is if the players pop apart, the grabbing player is the one that is moved back. A small change that would make it less of a griefing tactic.

It's not easy to punish if you are eliminated as the result of the action. Or you get stuck in a stalemate where you are both grabbing each other while everyone else runs on by. Plus many cases of counteracting usually results in the player sacrificing themselves.

For slime climb in particular, it's unbalanced to have one player have so much of an effect on everyone else. A simple solution is to have it go from 3 beams to 2, instead of 2 to 1.

And just because the devs haven't said anything doesn't mean that they don't acknowledge it or that if they don't acknowledge it, that it's not a problem.
                        >Sure, it's part of the game, but that doesn't necessarily means it's a good thing. If a large number of people don't enjoy it then, maybe it is worth taking another look at it.

That's fair, but I'd personally be disappointed if they did that. Imagine the game with no collisions, no grabbing.. sounds pretty boring to me.

&#x200B;

>I'd say one way to make it more balanced is if the players pop apart, the grabbing player is the one that is moved back. A small change that would make it less of a griefing tactic.

I'm getting the impression that you're not a fan of people trying to knock anyone out at all? People being pushed back by grabbing is one of the main ways to knock someone out. It's not "griefing" if it's part of the game. I mean you're meant to knock people out, whether you do that by completing the course quickly or otherwise, so I don't get how it's griefing.

&#x200B;

>It's not easy to punish if you are eliminated as the result of the action. Or you get stuck in a stalemate where you are both grabbing each other while everyone else runs on by. Plus many cases of counteracting usually results in the player sacrificing themselves.

Why would you be able to punish someone that eliminates you? If you got eliminated you got outplayed, that's all there is to it. If you're both stuck and both fail intentionally then I guess that's a throw and bad? If you hold someone back and still try to survive I don't think there's anything wrong with that. If you try to counteract a grab and sacrifice yourself then you've been outplayed.

&#x200B;

>For slime climb in particular, it's unbalanced to have one player have so much of an effect on everyone else. A simple solution is to have it go from 3 beams to 2, instead of 2 to 1.

Again I don't think it's that hard to get around it but I'd be open to that idea. You only need someone else to do it alongside you though.
                            I never said no collisions or grabbing. But I think grabbing has too much of a low risk/high reward. That's why making you the one that pops back if you grab evens it out. Note that you can also just walk into people to push them. It's about balance. And just because you came out on top doesn't mean you outplayed someone. Of all games, this game should teach you that.

Ultimately, it's about fun and I don't agree that winning = fun. Some of the most boring game types are the ones that I never get eliminated from (like perfect match or the one with the rotating cylinders). A lot of the un-funness in this game revolves around not running around so being locked in someone's grip is not really something I find enjoyable.

And as for me personally, it's not an issue as I'm rarely in these situations but as far as game mechanics go, there is room for a bit of fine tuning.
                            You're right about everything but that bottleneck in slime climb shouldn't be there.
    This. The pirate bean, although annoying was still playing the hame by trying to win himself. You were just plain griefing because you had no intentionof winning yourself.
        You assume the point of the game is to win.  Perhaps there are other goals.
            Some people like to win, others to have fun, i have fun screwing people over and even getting screwed over, i don't see why playing the game in a non toxic way is a issue
            ...like to piss other players off?? Which is what both OP and the pirate were doing???
    I agree 100%

Slime Climb is an elimination round. For every person you eliminate your chance of winning crown goes up.

It’s a totally legit part of the game. Social norms emerge in weird ways. The fact that so many people hate this kind of play to me indicates that it is highly successful, as evidenced by just 3 finishers.

The scummy move is the deliberate throwing of the game and pretending it’s karma. Apart from reddit karma, it’s a negative EV play. If you are going to do this to everyone who eliminates people you will be throwing away your chance at so many crowns.
    He's pretty locked in his way of thinking, and he has the upvotes to reassure him it's okay. Fortunately I think most people won't be willing to lose a crown and this shouldn't really be a common occurrence.  Still shitty to see that this community thinks  it's okay though.
        Why are you gatekeeping the way people play this game? If it's fun for them then let it be. Don't get too angry over petty things like this.
            OP is the one gatekeeping how people play the game legitimately, that’s the point. I knock people off in slimb climb to improve my odds of winning. Now I have to worry some asshole was so salty about it he’s going to throw the entire match just to stop me from winning? Like dude, they got a 3 man fall mountain because of the Pirate. If that doesn’t prove it’s competitively viable I don’t know what does. If I was OP I would have won the final instead of sabotaging. Clearly a lack of confidence
Well.. he did ruin slime climb and the crown for you.. you also lost while making the pirate bean lose.. sooooo, I guess he lost doing what he like most?
    [deleted]
        He wasn't being shitty. He was playing the game. Are you trying to tell me you haven't knocked anyone out on purpose? Because if you have, get off your high horse.
            [deleted]
                No, the point is winning the match. Eliminating 10 people and still qualifying is really easy and efficient.
                    [deleted]
                        griefing in this game is almost always not worth it hahahaha

every time anyone griefs they become the target in the lobby. there was once a toucan griefing at that exact spot in slime climb and everyone in the lobby made it their life mission to ensure that toucan. i ended up with the dub because i didn’t get involved!
                        So in egg scramble you don’t target the team with the least amount of eggs? Sounds like using your advantage to screw other people to me.

            Griefing is being shitty while playing the game
                There's nothing shitty about strategically eliminating enough people to skip straight to the final round, and improve your odds of winning. I know I've personally gotten crowns from knocking people off the beam because 4 man Fall Mountain is much easier than 13 man Fall Mountain. Apparently you're all too simple to understand strategy, though. It's a Battle Royale and nobody seems to understand what that entails.
People really get mad at this game? Serious question. I grief people, i play friendly.. everything is in the game to make it fun in the moment. 

If you get upset because someone pushes you into the goo.. grow up. It's a party game. You're supposed to be laughing and having fun. I've been in stitches from people throwing me off the edge when i didn't expect it.


But you have a full custom suit that costed at least, what? 6-8 crowns? Its okay if you lose dude, it's not a big deal to get griefed sometimes. Actually, it's fun.
i want the pbody skin so bad but im not good enough to consecutively win
10/10, good job
You are a hero since day 1
Not all heroes wear capes #legend
Now this is epic
Your a good man, sir.
I have 20 wins. At least 3 of them have come because I eliminated multiple people in Slime Climb, making the final much easier. It's literally part of the game. Sabotaging yourself and another person in the final round isn't really in good spirits though. If you're going to get revenge, try to fucking win too. Taking an L on purpose just to bring someone else down is lame and in my opinion, way worse than what the Pirate did, because thousands of people are doing it too. You actually griefed.
    Nope.  Causing a rage-inducing asshole to lose, even at my own loss, just so that another nice guy can win, is fun for me and most certainly in the spirit of the game.  Winning is rare, and honestly not all that fun. Its fun for a second.  The moment to moment experience is what I play for.  The game should be fun throughout your show.  Shit happens, but when assholes be assholes and make the game unfun for me and others, I'm going to return the favor and take my fun back.
    I said it before here but I didn't care about winning at this point since I already had enough wins to keep me happy. Letting someone win is something I've wanted to do but I never thought I'd have the chance, let alone in a situation this perfect, so I took my shot and it was worth it. I stand by what I did and I'll never regret it.
        You didn't just let someone else win, you also prevented someone from winning out of some kind of misguided sense of justice. If other people in the community start doing this type of shit then we get real toxicity. Stand by your dumb logic if you want, and enjoy the upvotes from all the shit players who don't know how to perform the simple task of getting around a dude blocking a beam.
            Jeez dude you're getting a bit too hostile over a game this casual. Were you the pirate skin I held back?
                > Jeez dude you're getting a bit too hostile over a game this casual

you posted a video of you getting pure revenge on someone in another map after they did a competitively helpful move...where is your ability for self reflection lol
                    Lol I'll give you that but I'd argue this guy is a bit more into this game than I am.
                \*Posts video of hostile act in game\*  


\*Calls someone out for being hostile over a few words\*
                    Live by the troll die by the troll.  You can't get mad at someone trolling you if you're being a huge asshole first.
                    Hostile isn't the right word I'll admit that. How about taking this game way too seriously given the content of the game? Tone it down a bit man you're getting angry over something that's not worth it.
                        You must be the 5 year old this game is targeted to. Jeez man. You're acting like a child
    Yea lmfao, too many butthurt kids who don’t know how to play the game in this thread. OP lost too so why’s he acting like he won LOL
        Because causing someone to lose, just like pirate caused all those people to lose, is fun. That’s what the game is about. Winning isn’t everything
            Yea that’s my point, so why’s OP salty about it? The pirate caused everyone to lose and OP went and did it too. It’s all in good fun
That's a bit of an overreaction
    I think he’s under-reacting
        Pirate was just playing the game. His methods of coming out on top we're also done in a fun way, whereas OP's methods was to just be salty and weren't within the spirit of the game
            "fun way"
            Completely agree, the aim of the game is to win by any means necessary which the pirate tried to do. OP just threw and ruined the game for himself and someone else
As someone who camps there sometimes, this was fair, well done.
[removed]
    >  what he's doing is completely fair play.

Yeah, I mean, so is grabbing them in fall mountain. 

Funny thing is they probably assumed the pigeon was friends with pbody, which would've been a reasonable assumption all in all.

All in all I think you're the one that's taking the bean game too seriously, not OP. Nothing says you have to 'try to win', I mean heck, the fact this COULD have been a co op scenario (squads being actively promoted) even though it wasn't nullifies any case you could make that sabotaging someone isn't accepted. 

The fact you can play with pals to get queued up as 'relatively solo' is indicative that the game's meant to be more fun than sweat, and that means doing something like this if you want. Hahah, bannable...

Anyways, I'll give it to you it's an overreaction, but it's a funny one, it's funny that they screwed over the pirate more than it's 'oh sweet vengeance'.
        [removed]
            Pardon? 

I didn't contradict my point in any way, because my point is only 'anything's fair game' lol.

It's cute how insanely salty you are anyways. You sure you don't wanna say some more stuff? C'mon, type some more.
                [removed]
                    You say that and yet you replied again, nice to see you again. :)

You got me, I do have ADHD actually, pal, would you like to rant on it a bit more? Get it all out there we're here for you.
    I'm with you dude. Slime climb is fun as hell because of the chaos and the meme beam, and it's really not even hard to get past someone standing on the beam either. This dude took an L on purpose for petty revenge.
        Not petty revenge. Justice.
            Yeah man, throwing a match is totally getting justice against someone who was strategically trying to win. Cool.
                Obviously stopping the asshat who played like a douche was more important. He's free to play like a douche, I'm free to be satisfied by being an instrument of karmic justice.
TIL the slime rises in Slime Climb.
Why so salty..

EDIT: struck a nerve? To all downvoters: don't be salty, watch some vids on how to do slime climb and play the game to win instead of becoming toxic like OP
[removed]
    Self-promotion isn't allowed here man, especially not in the comments of a random post that has nothing to do with your video.
Yeah you really taught that guy a lesson by throwing the game just to ruin his.

*post about pushing 5 people in a row to their death* : OMG UPVOTE UPVOTE GOLD AWARD AWARD SO FUNNY SUCH GOOD CONTENT

*post about someone miserably failing to eliminate anyone and having their final run ruined by a conscious thrower* OMG UPVOTE UPVOTE GOLD AWARD AWARD SO FUNNY SUCH GOOD CONTENT
    I mean yes, if someone pushes 5 people of it's still pretty funny, but I also don't mind people attempting to push me off, I find it more fun and challenging and it gives a sense of competition but idk
        yeah i really feel that sense of competition in the final round there,  really heating up in the final moments
            It's a completely meaningless game with no leaderboards and no real incentive to win besides some skins. You want to win? Great. You want to get revenge and ruin someones game? Sounds good to me.
                You want to win this game? You want to try and play the video game for its intended purpose and challenge yourself to some healthy competition with others? cool

You want to throw your game to fuck someone else over completely? You want to spend 90% of your time going out of your way to upset random people just trying to have fun or carry grudges throughout multiple stages to destroy any sense of competition or fun the final round might have had? Also equally as cool and totally valid and not in any way mean or petty.
                    It is quite possible that you take video games way too seriously. If you are that traumatized by a jelly bean trying to make you lose a game *for also trying to make him lose a game* then I think maybe you should reevaluate your priorities.

When you make enemies, anything can happen to you.
                        I don't see the point in exaggerating my annoyance or being reductive about anti-fun brigades in online games, neither of those help the discussion at all.

I think when you're playing an online game with other people you should have the tiniest amount of consideration. 

I don't think taking pleasure in annoying others is a healthy trait nor should it be encouraged, I don't think throwing your game to ruin someone else's is as valid as simply playing the game as intended and I genuinely believe people have every right to question this kind of spiteful behaviour in an all-ages online game when all it does is get them nowhere and get one random other person really confused and annoyed.

I truly do not see the point in feeding such an unhealthy compulsion when you gain nothing but satisfaction from the idea of upsetting someone and the other player is now 2% more stressed out than they need to be while attempting to enjoy the game.

In real life we heavily discourage that sort of behaviour and we still do despite the anonymity that the internet provides
            I wasn't reffering to this video though xd
                that's what I mean, in race rounds pushing and going for elims is fair game as its obviously encouraged, in final modes why literally ruin the whole thing?

One guy gets his free win with basically no effort, one guy has his chance to win removed completely and the last guy is sacrificing his opportunity to win solely to remove the chance of winning from guy 2; the literal only point behind it is petty revenge which is hilarious considering everyone is a number atm and you could easily confuse two identical players for each other and ruin  some poor innocent pirate's game for no reason.
                    Oh yeah, I completely agree in that case (not sarcastic)
                    Poor innocent pirate, i hope he recovers from this traumatising experience. Shall we make a gofundme page to pay for his therapy sessions?
Pirate players are the worst in my experience.
So what is it a crime or being a dick for playing the game and trying to eleminate other players?

    >So don't be a salty bitch.

Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you, the definition of irony.
        Honestly, I mostly agreed with his point. I was gonna upvote. Then I read that line and I went from upvote to downvote.
            I don't even agree with his point. You take your future into your own hands when you grief people, even if it's strategic to do so. Especially if you're in a distinguishing outfit.

People hold grudges. And this is coming from someone that works hard at murdering people on certain levels. I also target people who were being grabby on other levels. Sometimes you get killed for it and you just accept it and move on to the next.
        It's more like I watched this video and literally can't understand how some people feel fulfilment in this sort of "revenge" because from my perspective if you hold this kind of a grudge over multiple rounds and even are willing to lose yourself in order to screw someone else over then you're just a salty bitch.

I don't really care how many downvotes my comments get here. This is still my opinion.

I'm done replying to this thread though because clearly redditors think I'm wrong in this no matter what, so I'm not going waste any more of my time and mental health on this.
            You're taking this game and thread way too seriously if it's that taxing on your mental health.
            Spends 41 minutes acting like a salty bitch while accusing OP of being a salty bitch. LMFAO.
                everyone here is name-calling and acting like a salty-bitch, myself included, so you don't really have the right to say shit like that as if it isn't the exact way everyone else is behaving over a game
                    The only guy acting like a salty bitch is the guy I replied to. Everyone else in this thread is making fun of him. But thanks for incorrecting me lol.
                        ah I see, your definition of "salty bitch" doesn't include yourself or people who agree with you despite behaving almost identically to the people you're dog-piling on.

Very convenient
                            LMFAO are you actually white-knighting the guy acting like a salty bitch? Congrats, this is a new level of simp I haven't seen yet.
                                it took you a shockingly brief amount of time to call me a Simp lmao

It's literally like wrapping my 'W' in a pretty little box with rhinestones and ribbons and then kissing it and handing it to me in a maid outfit, seriously was there not one single better word you could think of in the English language to call someone over a disagreement relating to a colourful rainbow party game.
                                    LMFAO sure keep defending the guy who was so salty his comment got deleted by the mods. I'm sure he appreciates your white-knighting efforts, simp.

And why am I not surprised you're bitching about the OP elsewhere in this thread? LMFAO your sodium levels are as high as the guy you're white-knighting.

Sure, keep pretending you won. The whole thread knows who the real salty bitches are in this thread anyway no matter how much you try to hide behind "I'm not owned, I'm not owned!"
            It's a good thing you're going to stop replying because you're the only annoying dickwad here.
            Ok.
            >  then you're just a salty bitch.


> I'm not going waste any more of my mental health on this.

I hope you can see the irony yourself.
            Welcome in reddit, you can't have opinions
                The guy is right in his own way , I mostly find joy when winning , this game is fun but its even more when you win , and sabotaging yourself for the pirate bean not to win is not worth it for me , but the pirate definitely learned a lesson for his unfair plays
                    unfair? why do you think they put grabbing in the game?

Not for people to kamikaze and throw their game to ruin someone else's too, but as one extra tool at your disposal to add some kind of strategy and contest to the game. 

I'd say grabbing is one of the least unfair things as everyone can do it but can be easily countered by jumping and diving as well as basic human nature dictating that 99% of players aren't just going to grab you for no reason and put themselves behind.
                        What he did wasnt grabbing , he was standing in the middle of the way on those yellow bridges , maybe it doesnt seem fair to you but implicitly its not something that needs to be encouraged
                            I simply jump and dive over them, 80% success rate
                                Can you ? Its hard to find balance when walking on these poles , cant imagine how it is diving over , for sure you would fall off no ?
                                    Sometimes I do but diving is the same as walking on those; if you do it in a straight line you shouldn't lose balance
                    i don't understand why people think what the pirate is doing is unfair. falling to someone blocking the pole like that is pretty nooby, you can either push them off the pole or just jump and dive over them.

if i were OP i would have just dived over the head of the pirate at the end of the course and killed him there.

the guy who called him a salty bitch was being pretty rude about it but i mostly agree with him. i would rather try to kill the guy who bullied me or one-up him by winning the crown himself. i don't see the satisfaction in griefing that guy and yourself for petty revenge.
                        I agree totally thats not a way to get revenge since you are jeoparding your chances of winning , but Slime Climb is hard and stressful enough that blocking the pole to access the next floor is maybe not unfair but its totally not fair , Lose Lose situation for both players
    Sounds like you're the salty one. I'm just having fun getting my revenge and avenging the other beans.
        Ignore that guy, tosspot.

I always knock people off on slime climb and any other chance I get and thought your video was hilarious.

I'd not even be angry if it happened to me, that's the game. Bean and be beaned.
        Glad you're having fun without getting wins.
            I've got enough wins to keep me happy. Sounds like you're taking this game too seriously.
                says the guy who took enough offense to a beam patroller to sabotage his own finals lol
                    Lol I stand by what I did. He had to learn his lesson the hard way.
                Nah I just find this sort of idea of "revenge" where you're only costing your own win petty and childish. I'd have forgotten about the guy within seconds.
                    I can't believe there's already elitists like you in this game. I'm just here sharing the fun I'm having and you immediately shit on it.
                        not holding a grudge and not going out of your way to spite them isn't elitism lmao
                        Already said I'm glad you're having fun without getting wins. I wasn't being sarcastic.

The way I have fun in this game is by winning. If I had done the exact thing you did in the video I would not have felt good about it at all because I clearly would have cost my win.
                            And as we all know, winning is the only thing that matters.
                                i mean in the finals, yes... it is.
                                winning because you had a better run than everyone else in the lobby feels good. you also get rewarded. 

in my opinion the way to get revenge on the pirate that would actually feel satisfying would be by beating him. maybe if you want to be petty grab him before he can grab the crown and take it. but i agree with the guy you're replying to, just sacrificing your ability to win on the final round because someone was playing smart earlier just feels like petty revenge. you didn't outplay him, you didn't deny him the crown and show him he lost because he didn't kill you before. if the third bean was your friend and you were just gifting him a win that would be different though.
                            If you think only winning is fun then you should just hack the game, and have all the fun collecting crowns without any effort :)

                                    I love how you claim him to be childish in a child’s games. Like wtf. That’s like a acussing someone for being a fucking adult when doing taxes.
        wouldnt a much better revenge be to.. you know.. win the fall mountain?

all youre doing is literally giving the guy credit that hes so much better than you that it takes 2 people teaming to be able to beat him.
            No cause this was way more satisfying to me. Besides, why go for something you MIGHT have a shot at when you could go for something guaranteed like dragging this bean down with me? I already had enough wins to keep me happy anyways.
                Because its dumb.   Theres going to be beam patrollers in literally every game pretty soon.  Have fun never winning again and "teaching everyone a lesson" lol.
                    I literally won 3 games after this. What you find dumb I find fun and that's okay. I saw my shot and took it and this'll probably never happen again so I'm happy.
                    You're really missing the writing on the wall
    Lol you're the salty pirate bean in the video, aren't ya?
    Dude you literally don't have to troll / block other players to win, the game automatically already narrows down the player pool with every single round
    lmao downvoted for pointing out a valid strategy compared to a bitch-move ruining the fun for every single person in the game
    I got downvoted today for having the exact opposite opinion as this. Reddit sure is a fickle place.

            What goes around comes around? You can feel free to block people's progress in this game (it is a Battle Royale) you just have to be prepared for any consequences that may come your way.
 I am one of those who will gleefully mess with people on that beam. It's one of life's simple pleasures. Also on the one where there is a slime ramp with moving bumpers at the very end. I love turning around and giving someone a complete denial shove down the slime and then turn back around to barely qualify.
I wanted to say that i was the pirate bean because i literally did the same in slimb climb but then i saw his skin
So basically this game is designed to trigger a bunch of mentally fragile kids heading back to school....
[Jesus that was sad](https://youtu.be/IuzgoG6Td4k?t=107)
Yeah fuck that guy for trying to play smart and eliminate other players. Definitely deserved having his game ruined by a toxic revenge quest that didn’t benefit either party involved
    I fucking hate everyone who plays this game so he deserved it. I hope he fucking cried about it.
    Some people sabotage others for fun and others sabotage saboteurs for fun. Idk if something like that is worthy of being called a 'toxic revenge quest' lmao
This is petty af. He was playing the game to eliminate more players before the final, and you were griefing to riin both yours and his run. Not the same. He was playing the game (although being somewhat toxic) while you were just plain toxic.
Salty
That cut was Sus, I feel like you pushed someone off
I think this is extremely petty & BM. Trying to sabotage other players while still going for the win is fine and part of the game's mechanics. You stopped trying to go for the win and switched your goal to making him lose. You need to be a bit more chill and a bit less of a douche.
https://clips.twitch.tv/FancyEnthusiasticShrewPRChase     


What happens in this clip? Biggest fail ever
He made smart plays to try to win and you threw your own chances of winning out of rage lol. Congrats on the loss OP nice work!
    Not a smart play to push people off, it’s not gonna change how many people you’re facing in the next round and it only hurts you and your victims day
        He said slime climb. It absolutely does change how many people you are going to face next round. If you sit on the yellow beam you can kill at least 5 people for free
I hope that guy bm’d you afterwards. That would be the icing on to cake.
Why would you name yourself mcskillet?
I demand an entire series on Netflix following these three characters and their exciting journeys.
    Starring Tobey Maguire and Samuel L Jackson
        and then a reboot movie around ten movies later, with skateboarding involving a skateboard glued to the actors feet
            Is this a reference I don't understand or are you just some comedic genius?
                There's a video of Tony Hawk criticising skating in movies and Spiderman 3 featured. He wasn't impressed with the fake skating. I had recently watched it.
    Can My Little league fall guy be a side character?
        Batty McBean,  the Bean Mafia enforcer who goes yard on kneecaps.
            YES.
    So, which character is just gonna be gay for their development?

Edit: I know y’all didn’t just get salty for a running joke about Netflix...

            You seem to be confusing Netflix with Nutflix.
            Mad
        I asume at first you got downvoted, because you know, feminists. The funny thing is how some people get so butthirt about their "fights" and campaigns and seem to believe that being gay/black/trans makes you a so much better and more interesting person when in some cases seems to be just what describes them and their only trait
            People don't believe being gay black or trans makes you more interesting. Its just representation in media for groups who haven't had much at all outside of joke side characters and grave fillers.
            What? This has nothing to do with feminists lmao

It’s just a joke about Netflix writers

Don't wanna spoil too much, but the pirate has a REALLY nice redemption arc in the Jump Rope Canyon story arc. Should check it out.

Maybe I should message him and ask some follow up questions. Now I want to know what he was thinking.
    Based on their username, I’d think it was an old dad who just won their first game
    Did you ever win before?
It’s moments like this that I I wish we could keep track of the players you’re up against.  You could have “rivals” that if you end up playing against, you get double XP or something if you beat them!
All will be revealed on the next episode of...
This demands a season 2
Someone message the winner, we must know.

If you don’t do this is slime climb you’re making the win harder for yourself. Cull that herd 

Also it’s fun as fuck to boop people off the beam

    Man, how many people here hate griefers, but then get excited when Alpharad or some other YouTuber does that exact thing? Why hate people for playing the game?

    lol the downvotes are hillarious, some of you take this game way too seriously
        This happens on every game subreddit. People playing the game in a way the masses deem wrong get shit on constantly so everybody can have some faux sense of being a good person
    Absolute chad. Keep it up king.
    No they don’t. I can tell you’re pissed
        I can tell you're pissed.

Actually I can't because it's reddit and I don't know you.
            Good man. Stay safe.
    My first win was result of me eliminating a lot of people in slime climb, which resulted in a 4 man hex a gone.

  


Keep it up brother
        [removed]
And he almost did Lol
The only time I was close to winning I got up there and  jumped but landed on the conveyor. I didn’t even know I could miss that jump since it was my first and only time
    [removed]
        I literally never knew this. The amount of the times where I made it to the last level only to just bump my head onto the crown...
            It’s says it during the loading screen AND reminds you at the top of your screen in game to grab the crown using R2
        i lost what would have been my first win just because i didn’t know u have to grab it
        I got a win 2 days ago because 4 people in front of me didn't grab the crown when they jumped at it...
        I really don't understand this requirement. It doesn't up the skill level. It's just a new mechanic introduced in a loading screen and in small text up in the corner. It's a very strange design decision.
            It means you can't dive for the crown (since you can't grab while diving), so it does slightly change the game.
                I made a dive for it my first and, to this day, only time making it up there before anyone else, and I bonked my head.

Just realized why I didn't win then.
                    I dived too! RIP
                The dive wouldn't always be the best option anyway since it lowers your character's collision box, and thus would prevent you from touching the crown if it's a bit too high, whereas a normal jump would reach it.

Removing the need to grab would add the need to decide whether you dive or jump, and also would fix all the bugs related to grabbing the crown (there are a lot). IMO it's a win-win. It's an arbitrary requirement that only steals wins from new players anyway.
                I’ve head butted the crown twice now I never knew you couldn’t dive and grab
                Wait what? That explains all the fall mountain losses I’ve had lol
            Idk it feels pretty logical. Bean that gets his hands to the final object first wins. If getting to the top would be the only thing that matters it would just be a finish line.
            I think they did it for publicity. It's funny to watch someone go for their first win, and not realize they need to grab.
        No shit? You just saved me so many last games
I expect we'd be getting a very different Reddit post from a different bean.
Bruh I made the top 10 five times last night and 4/5 times it was fall ball. Can’t stand that game mode
    I got to the top 10 about 7 times yesterday and every s i n g l e time it was tip toe. I’m going to commit war crimes
        A tip for tip toe if you are on pc, if you have a bug where you slide around a lot on the tiles, turn off your vsync. Works wonders.
            Wasn't there a patch for that physics bug?
                Idk
    >4/5 times it was fall ball

&#x200B;

I feel like 9 of the 10 players are made out of marsh mellows and one guy is a brick unit that smashes the ball... One day there will be a no team mode and we shall rejoice.
        A solo mode only option is the one thing this games needs most tbh.


Don't remove the modes but don't force me to play them when I don't want to.
    Why?  That game mode almost always feels like a skill based competition, rather than a luck based one, to me.
        Coming on this sub for the first time was so sad, fall ball is the BEST and everyone hates it. Any team games with balls are my favorite for sure
            The problem is one team is always uneven and gets fucked because of it
                I totally get that
                    [deleted]
                        Dude, I hit the ball and my guy just falls over... I don't like anh of the ball games besides Rock 'N' Roll
            The uneven nature get me more than my feelings for the game. If there is an uneven number dont do a team game
        Because whether or not I get skilled team mates is the lucky part
            That's...every game ever though, right?
                No? Not the solo games, or games where you can choose your team.
    If it makes you feel any better, they are releasing a patch sometime this week to fix uneven teams
    I have legit played Tip Toe over 20 games in a row the last couple of days. I'm so over that stupid game mode.
    I got fucking uneven team fall ball I shit you not 15 times in a row when it should have just gone to a finale. It's long boring team based and frustrating. Fuck fall ball, that game mode needs to be taken out back and shot

Fuck Royal fumble too
    Cry me a riiiver
3 players left?!?!?

Hoarders, take it or leave it.
    you know, that would actually be funnier than a 4v5 fall ball
Seriously the final game is always a teambased one if the numbers are uneven.
I had a 10v10 fall ball last night but it might as well have been 3v17 by my team either hitting the ball in our own goal or just completely missing it
oooh, salty
    Absolutely! Luckily Fall Guys is such a happy little fun game I don't get too salty at least for too long.
I’ve been both people depending on my mood haha

What you don’t love a cluster fuck for fall mountain?
    I had a 17 man Hex-a-gone.

IT. WAS. GLORIOUS.
        18 was the most I've played. It's a complete no skill ultra shit show. 


Been hoping to have it again ever since.
I once got into a final with only one other player left. Of course we played Royal Fumble
The thing is the pirate would’ve probably bean (see what I did there) salty at the end even though he was doing it to other people.
    It's not the same thing. 

Trying to eliminate as many players as you can in Slime climb is fine. 


What OP did wasn't fine, giving up your own chances of winning so you can grief someone isn't cool. OP was just petty and a lot more toxic than the pirate for basically no reason and i absolutly don't understand why people upvote this post. It would be completly different story if OP killed him in slime climb, that would be funny.
        LOL so its OK to grief others as long as you win, but you can't grief others at your own expense?  Get real.

I have far more fun griefing griefers than going for the win (and more success).  I've gone so far as to hold on to griefers on that block dodging map so we both get pushed off.  How is that any worse than just pushing him off?  Does it take less skill to sacrifice myself?  Sure.  Is it fair.  Of course it is.  Its hilarious that griefers have a code of honor about griefing.
            There are obviously multiple levels of griefing and some are more ok than others, don't know what's so hard to understand. Griefing doesn't have to necessarily be a bad thing and can be fun.

Giving up your chances of winning because you want to target grief someone is so much worse than pushing random people because you want to eliminate them.
                Fair enough.  However, those who seek to purposely eliminate others can't possible expect that those other players will not be upset and seek revenge.
                    That's true, you will make other players angry and angry people aren't usually very rational.

I just think behavior like in this clip shouldn't be glorified, you are not some saint who killed evil, you got mad and did something stupid. Someone pushed you? Push him back, don't try to completly destroy him no matter the costs.
        I mean, if he griefed, he can get griefed too
        I have a problem with the slime Climb beam blocking because all it does is eliminate beans that spawned in the back. It’s not like the blocker was better, they spawned in an advantageous spot.
            I am not exactly sure how it works, but aren't spawns based on previous rounds?
                No they’re random
        Trying to eliminate players in races IS griefing. 🤦‍♂️
            Griefing doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing. 

Pushing random people with intended mechanic is good griefing, it's just a bit of fun. Some levels would be very boring without griefing, Roll Out for example.

Giving up your chances of winning because you want to completly destroy 1 person is bad and toxic.
                The issue here is that you're drawing the line between what is griefing to you and what isn't and that's an arguable line and most people don't see it as such.

You cannot simply say, "well, this griefing is okay and this one isn't" because griefing is griefing. 

Also, who's to say that the person gave up his chances? For the majority of the race, he was straight behind him for a potential chance to win if the hammers or balls hit Pirate any harder.

As you said, "it's just a bit of fun". If you're going to grief, you have zero right to complain about getting griefed back, regardless of whether or not its final game.
                    No, the issue is you are not capable of thinking about griefing as something not horrible.

If you are still trying to win I don't care what you do, that's it. I am not trying to set some hypothetical line between good griefing and bad griefing, it's extremly simple. If you make it your life mission to destroy someone because he pushed you once, you are dumb. If everyone stopped griefing, this game would be boring. Some levels like Roll out wouldn't be nearly as fun as they are now.


And please don't even try to argue player in this clip was trying to win, he very obviously wasn't, he literally waited for that pirate every time he was ahead of him.
                        > No, the issue is you are not capable of thinking about griefing as something not horrible.

No, I never implied that. The logic is that if you grief someone, expect to be griefed back. It's that simple. It seems you're the one that isn't capable of grasping that.

This has no merit on whether or not its strategic or causing yourself the loss.
                            Again, you completly ignore my point. You can't just say griefing Is griefing, it doesn't work like that, just because it's called griefing doesn't mean it's the same thing.

I wouldn't expect you to steal my phone because i stole your chicken wing. I would expect you to steal my chicken nugget. You are basically saying I should expect you to steal everything because i stole from you and it's fine because stealing is stealing.

It's the same with griefing, I would expect you to try to push me after I pushed you, I wouldnt expect to make an enemy for life because i pushed you. 

Of course it's not forbbiden, people can do that, but it's very unreasonable toxic behavior and shouldn't be glorified like people do in this post.
                                > I wouldn't expect you to steal my phone because i stole your chicken wing. I would expect you to steal my chicken nugget. 

Well, that's where you're wrong. You shouldn't expect someone to do you wrong at the same level because you did them wrong.

That's like saying I shouldn't expect you to steal -anything- from me, and you did, so therefore, don't expect me to steal whatever equivalent you have because -you- cause the neutrality to tip in the first place. That logic is linear to the overall toxicity.
        Shouldn't be downvoted. Slime climb eliminating is all fun and games but targeted griefing is totally uncalled for
            You forgot the /s

I always target the asshat and I've seen a few more people do the same.  The community is allowed to retaliate in any way they see fit.  You want to grief?  I want to make Fall Guys a place of peace and harmony.
                We all want a positive gaming community and that is what we're steering towards but the grab function exists to mess around with others. It's a core gameplay mechanic. I can't stop anyone from being a dickhead and petty towards someone who uses this mechanic but it shouldn't be praised.

EDIT: Thanks for the downvotes guys. Very constructive.
Using game mechanics to help win an individual game isn't toxic lol.

Do you think grab exists primarily for hugs?
    "Help Win" is not the correct way to say it btw. You can win Slime Climb without eliminating the other competition. That's what he was doing.

&#x200B;

However, if you do eliminate the other competition, expect other beans to be fucking pissed at you. Yes, valid strategy to thin out the herd, but you're still an asshole. Slime Climb is hard enough without pirate beans.
        How did it not help him? Isn't it a lot easier to win Fall mountain or other final rounds with 3 people than it is with 10 people?

Eliminating people doesn't help you win the individual game of Slime Climb. You can win Slime Climb by focusing on yourself.   


It is a valid strategy for thinning the herd but it doesn't guarantee your victory.
                People want to act like there's no social aspect to this game, but that's impossible for any game where humans interact. If you want to focus on ensuring failure in others in order to increase your odds, that is an acceptable strategy. It's not morally wrong or anything. But you're gonna want to enter revenge into your calculus of how the game is gonna go.
                    Live by the grab, die by the grab.
        If you get mad at people killing you in fall guys, that’s just silly
            It's a valid strategy. Doesn't mean I don't love to see them get taken out the same way they took out others or myself.
                Live by the sword die by the sword
                    Live by the yeet, die by the yeet.
            I don't get mad. I get even.
        People are acting like this game isn't a battle royale lol
How was the Pirate being toxic? It's a competition
    Bruh this isn’t a sweaty game
    Just because it's a competition doesn't mean someone can't be toxic. The pirate was standing in the one spot on the whole map that can block everyone else and cause them to die, just so he could eliminate all of them. It might be part of the game, but it is definitely toxic.
        i agree, its part of the game and okay do it if you wanna that much, but dont expect people to treat you nice after you're doing this.
        You guys are hilarious lol. It's all part of the fun. You're not MLG Pro gamers.
            Wouldn’t the pirates attempt to block everyone from winning be the actual MLG move? Everyone else just wants to actually play the game.
                The dude stopped for a few seconds. Relax. You guys are calling him a toxic gamer like he's spewing racist threats and aimbotting. I can't believe how bent out of shape you're all being over this.
                Dude it’s a game where you play as a bean and run obstacles. They added grab as a fun mechanic. The point of the game is to have fun.
                    Some of us don’t have a lot of time to play. If I can only afford an hour of game time a day I want to spend it actually playing the game.
        Not to mention how toxic everyone else is for trying to win the game. We really should restart concentration camps for people like that
EDIT: you people are beyond help
            What the fuck is wrong with you?
    It's a race. Just go cross the finish line. You don't see people in the Olympics trying to trip each other. The anonymity of the internet brings out peoples true personalities.
        Why do you think they added the mechanic? It’s fun. It’s suppose to the fun.
            I just think it's funny that people get so bent out of shape over a game mechanic. Yeah I get why you dont like it it's not exactly fun to be on the receiving end of a grab that eliminates you but for some people it's part of the fun.  People are so desperate to have their cake and eat it too. By this subs definition of toxic, targeting the losing team in Egg Scramble is probably toxic as well but I never see anyone play any other way. Its just a silly game get over it.
                100 percent on board. It’s supposed to be a silly, fun game. Plus you get sweet karma vids lol. I guarantee that the person who was who grabbing in the OP post wasn’t upset they lost lol.
I always figured it as a unspoken rule that you are allowed to "play dirty", but accept the risk that others may justifiably seek retribution against you.
    the problem with this is people not minding their own business and gang up on YOU because they walk over and see you knocking XYZ over a cliff and think you are the aggressor.
    thats how i play this game, i like to screw over people knowing that if they survive they might give everything up just for revenge, i really don't know why people get so mad over this, i am just playing the game in my own way, i am not hacking or anything
        Yep, I die plenty of times trying to be a dick. It's part of the fun.
            Yes! I will be in stitches from trying to fuck some one over and end up sending myself into oblivion. And then i get right back into another game a minute later. 

There are a lot of babies on this thread through. I'm definitely going to be grabbing players more often. 

Its a party game, with a grab mechanic, which is fun. Stop trying to make everything a PVE game. A little pvp makes everything better.
                My biggest attitude shift has been in the game Roll Out. I used to just mind my business and go back and forth. It would be very rare if I didn't qualify but now I run around like an ass trying to shove people off. This has probably doubled my chances of being eliminated but it's now chaotic fun and a course I enjoy rather than it being a chore.
                    It also has doubled your fun i bet. The games people just run back and forth and try not to fall off the platform is too many. The grabbing on that stage adds a ton of fun.
                        Yep, I usually go dizzy trying to adjust the camera though. That's usually how I fall through.
People automatically assumed pirate bean was acting that way purely out of competitive spirit, without even considering the possibility he just wanted to be a dick to the people behind him.
    I think him waiting at the finish line proves he was trying to troll.  I don’t feel bad at all for him.
        You can knock people off at the end too. Notice how many people they had in their fall mountain, and why. Now ask yourself if the Pirate gave himself better odds to win.
            He absolutely did and I have no problem with it.  I just find it annoying when I’m on the receiving end and if you play like that you can’t be surprised when someone sabotages your win.
Bloody *pirates!*
No.
    ok :(
Because the Pirate eliminated everyone in climb climb. Extremely strategic.
Instead send the money to people in need instead of a dude "sticking it to the man" on Reddit
    Where do you donate your money?
        Red cross
    I do do that instead. Instead, it's called Watsi and it crowd funds healthcare for people around the world. Instead of them staying sick they get help.
That's slime climb for you. I won one of my first games of royal fumble cause slime climb killed everyone except me and another bean and I spawned with the tail. I was ecstatic but immediately knew it was unfair.
    I'm super envious, haha, slime is my absolute favorite, but it never trims the numbers quite that well in my lobbies. Maybe one day.

Also yeah rough day for the other person there...
    I have never seen a single digit slimb climb. its usually something like 21 people and 17 make it through with 2-3 of the knockouts being from griefers. Are you on PS4?
Same thing happened to me a few days ago but it was royal fumble and my latency fucked me
    I hate the hit box ones. Their net code is meh
        It doesn’t help that my internet is garbage either
It's the P-Body top with the aquarium lower half.
Da Fuck? Slime climb is the best level. Tho I can agree with mountain fall being stupid.
    I hate it cuz I never won.  The level design is very good it's just sooo hard for me I rage quit the game.
        Lol yes it's hard but ngl even tho it's hard it's the best map.
Usually after a hellacious round of slime climb.
You trying to repost without my permission? How dare you?! These internet points are my life I won't let you take this from me! /s
Some people would say the goal of the game is to have fun, and pirate was taking that away from people. So the punishment fits the crime
    Does trying to win inherently take away fun from the game? I've been knocked out plenty of times and taken it in good fun, it's part of the game. But I see throwing as strictly salty and/or counter fun. OP says people are taking the game too seriously, but I'd say it's the other way round.
        It does if you take away the fun from other people. In general, it's not fun when you are immobilized, in any fashion, whether by gameplay mechanic or other player. You are free to do it but you should also accept the consequences of those actions.

Also, I'd say the pirate is exploiting a design flaw in the level. It's the only place in the whole game where one person can bottleneck a level from everyone else. There really isn't a good way around it and the situation is very unbalanced towards the player camping that spot.
            >It does if you take away the fun from other people. In general, it's not fun when you are immobilized, in any fashion, whether by gameplay mechanic or other player. You are free to do it but you should also accept the consequences of those actions.

Nonetheless it's part of the game though. If you weren't meant to be able to grab/block people it wouldn't be there? I think people are ready to accept the consequences, because you can easily get punished for doing any of these things. But I think throwing is a step too far.

&#x200B;

>Also, I'd say the pirate is exploiting a design flaw in the level. It's the only place in the whole game where one person can bottleneck a level from everyone else. There really isn't a good way around it and the situation is very unbalanced towards the player camping that spot.

It's not that hard to get around it though. I'd say the flaw is in the start more so than that part, because at least if it was skill alone that got you there first that'd be better. But the developers haven't really said anything against this part, and even embraced the memes.
                Sure, it's part of the game, but that doesn't necessarily means it's a good thing. If a large number of people don't enjoy it then, maybe it is worth taking another look at it. I'd say one way to make it more balanced is if the players pop apart, the grabbing player is the one that is moved back. A small change that would make it less of a griefing tactic.

It's not easy to punish if you are eliminated as the result of the action. Or you get stuck in a stalemate where you are both grabbing each other while everyone else runs on by. Plus many cases of counteracting usually results in the player sacrificing themselves.

For slime climb in particular, it's unbalanced to have one player have so much of an effect on everyone else. A simple solution is to have it go from 3 beams to 2, instead of 2 to 1.

And just because the devs haven't said anything doesn't mean that they don't acknowledge it or that if they don't acknowledge it, that it's not a problem.
                    >Sure, it's part of the game, but that doesn't necessarily means it's a good thing. If a large number of people don't enjoy it then, maybe it is worth taking another look at it.

That's fair, but I'd personally be disappointed if they did that. Imagine the game with no collisions, no grabbing.. sounds pretty boring to me.

&#x200B;

>I'd say one way to make it more balanced is if the players pop apart, the grabbing player is the one that is moved back. A small change that would make it less of a griefing tactic.

I'm getting the impression that you're not a fan of people trying to knock anyone out at all? People being pushed back by grabbing is one of the main ways to knock someone out. It's not "griefing" if it's part of the game. I mean you're meant to knock people out, whether you do that by completing the course quickly or otherwise, so I don't get how it's griefing.

&#x200B;

>It's not easy to punish if you are eliminated as the result of the action. Or you get stuck in a stalemate where you are both grabbing each other while everyone else runs on by. Plus many cases of counteracting usually results in the player sacrificing themselves.

Why would you be able to punish someone that eliminates you? If you got eliminated you got outplayed, that's all there is to it. If you're both stuck and both fail intentionally then I guess that's a throw and bad? If you hold someone back and still try to survive I don't think there's anything wrong with that. If you try to counteract a grab and sacrifice yourself then you've been outplayed.

&#x200B;

>For slime climb in particular, it's unbalanced to have one player have so much of an effect on everyone else. A simple solution is to have it go from 3 beams to 2, instead of 2 to 1.

Again I don't think it's that hard to get around it but I'd be open to that idea. You only need someone else to do it alongside you though.
                        I never said no collisions or grabbing. But I think grabbing has too much of a low risk/high reward. That's why making you the one that pops back if you grab evens it out. Note that you can also just walk into people to push them. It's about balance. And just because you came out on top doesn't mean you outplayed someone. Of all games, this game should teach you that.

Ultimately, it's about fun and I don't agree that winning = fun. Some of the most boring game types are the ones that I never get eliminated from (like perfect match or the one with the rotating cylinders). A lot of the un-funness in this game revolves around not running around so being locked in someone's grip is not really something I find enjoyable.

And as for me personally, it's not an issue as I'm rarely in these situations but as far as game mechanics go, there is room for a bit of fine tuning.
                        You're right about everything but that bottleneck in slime climb shouldn't be there.
This. The pirate bean, although annoying was still playing the hame by trying to win himself. You were just plain griefing because you had no intentionof winning yourself.
    You assume the point of the game is to win.  Perhaps there are other goals.
        Some people like to win, others to have fun, i have fun screwing people over and even getting screwed over, i don't see why playing the game in a non toxic way is a issue
        ...like to piss other players off?? Which is what both OP and the pirate were doing???
I agree 100%

Slime Climb is an elimination round. For every person you eliminate your chance of winning crown goes up.

It’s a totally legit part of the game. Social norms emerge in weird ways. The fact that so many people hate this kind of play to me indicates that it is highly successful, as evidenced by just 3 finishers.

The scummy move is the deliberate throwing of the game and pretending it’s karma. Apart from reddit karma, it’s a negative EV play. If you are going to do this to everyone who eliminates people you will be throwing away your chance at so many crowns.
He's pretty locked in his way of thinking, and he has the upvotes to reassure him it's okay. Fortunately I think most people won't be willing to lose a crown and this shouldn't really be a common occurrence.  Still shitty to see that this community thinks  it's okay though.
    Why are you gatekeeping the way people play this game? If it's fun for them then let it be. Don't get too angry over petty things like this.
        OP is the one gatekeeping how people play the game legitimately, that’s the point. I knock people off in slimb climb to improve my odds of winning. Now I have to worry some asshole was so salty about it he’s going to throw the entire match just to stop me from winning? Like dude, they got a 3 man fall mountain because of the Pirate. If that doesn’t prove it’s competitively viable I don’t know what does. If I was OP I would have won the final instead of sabotaging. Clearly a lack of confidence
[deleted]
    He wasn't being shitty. He was playing the game. Are you trying to tell me you haven't knocked anyone out on purpose? Because if you have, get off your high horse.
        [deleted]
            No, the point is winning the match. Eliminating 10 people and still qualifying is really easy and efficient.
                [deleted]
                    griefing in this game is almost always not worth it hahahaha

every time anyone griefs they become the target in the lobby. there was once a toucan griefing at that exact spot in slime climb and everyone in the lobby made it their life mission to ensure that toucan. i ended up with the dub because i didn’t get involved!
                    So in egg scramble you don’t target the team with the least amount of eggs? Sounds like using your advantage to screw other people to me.

                            So if I start in the last row am I legally allowed to stand on the beam?

                    [deleted]
        Griefing is being shitty while playing the game
            There's nothing shitty about strategically eliminating enough people to skip straight to the final round, and improve your odds of winning. I know I've personally gotten crowns from knocking people off the beam because 4 man Fall Mountain is much easier than 13 man Fall Mountain. Apparently you're all too simple to understand strategy, though. It's a Battle Royale and nobody seems to understand what that entails.
Nope.  Causing a rage-inducing asshole to lose, even at my own loss, just so that another nice guy can win, is fun for me and most certainly in the spirit of the game.  Winning is rare, and honestly not all that fun. Its fun for a second.  The moment to moment experience is what I play for.  The game should be fun throughout your show.  Shit happens, but when assholes be assholes and make the game unfun for me and others, I'm going to return the favor and take my fun back.
I said it before here but I didn't care about winning at this point since I already had enough wins to keep me happy. Letting someone win is something I've wanted to do but I never thought I'd have the chance, let alone in a situation this perfect, so I took my shot and it was worth it. I stand by what I did and I'll never regret it.
    You didn't just let someone else win, you also prevented someone from winning out of some kind of misguided sense of justice. If other people in the community start doing this type of shit then we get real toxicity. Stand by your dumb logic if you want, and enjoy the upvotes from all the shit players who don't know how to perform the simple task of getting around a dude blocking a beam.
        Jeez dude you're getting a bit too hostile over a game this casual. Were you the pirate skin I held back?
            > Jeez dude you're getting a bit too hostile over a game this casual

you posted a video of you getting pure revenge on someone in another map after they did a competitively helpful move...where is your ability for self reflection lol
                Lol I'll give you that but I'd argue this guy is a bit more into this game than I am.
            \*Posts video of hostile act in game\*  


\*Calls someone out for being hostile over a few words\*
                Live by the troll die by the troll.  You can't get mad at someone trolling you if you're being a huge asshole first.
                Hostile isn't the right word I'll admit that. How about taking this game way too seriously given the content of the game? Tone it down a bit man you're getting angry over something that's not worth it.
                    You must be the 5 year old this game is targeted to. Jeez man. You're acting like a child
Yea lmfao, too many butthurt kids who don’t know how to play the game in this thread. OP lost too so why’s he acting like he won LOL
    Because causing someone to lose, just like pirate caused all those people to lose, is fun. That’s what the game is about. Winning isn’t everything
        Yea that’s my point, so why’s OP salty about it? The pirate caused everyone to lose and OP went and did it too. It’s all in good fun
I think he’s under-reacting
    Pirate was just playing the game. His methods of coming out on top we're also done in a fun way, whereas OP's methods was to just be salty and weren't within the spirit of the game
        "fun way"
        Completely agree, the aim of the game is to win by any means necessary which the pirate tried to do. OP just threw and ruined the game for himself and someone else
>  what he's doing is completely fair play.

Yeah, I mean, so is grabbing them in fall mountain. 

Funny thing is they probably assumed the pigeon was friends with pbody, which would've been a reasonable assumption all in all.

All in all I think you're the one that's taking the bean game too seriously, not OP. Nothing says you have to 'try to win', I mean heck, the fact this COULD have been a co op scenario (squads being actively promoted) even though it wasn't nullifies any case you could make that sabotaging someone isn't accepted. 

The fact you can play with pals to get queued up as 'relatively solo' is indicative that the game's meant to be more fun than sweat, and that means doing something like this if you want. Hahah, bannable...

Anyways, I'll give it to you it's an overreaction, but it's a funny one, it's funny that they screwed over the pirate more than it's 'oh sweet vengeance'.
    [removed]
        Pardon? 

I didn't contradict my point in any way, because my point is only 'anything's fair game' lol.

It's cute how insanely salty you are anyways. You sure you don't wanna say some more stuff? C'mon, type some more.
            [removed]
                You say that and yet you replied again, nice to see you again. :)

You got me, I do have ADHD actually, pal, would you like to rant on it a bit more? Get it all out there we're here for you.
I'm with you dude. Slime climb is fun as hell because of the chaos and the meme beam, and it's really not even hard to get past someone standing on the beam either. This dude took an L on purpose for petty revenge.
    Not petty revenge. Justice.
        Yeah man, throwing a match is totally getting justice against someone who was strategically trying to win. Cool.
            Obviously stopping the asshat who played like a douche was more important. He's free to play like a douche, I'm free to be satisfied by being an instrument of karmic justice.
Self-promotion isn't allowed here man, especially not in the comments of a random post that has nothing to do with your video.
I mean yes, if someone pushes 5 people of it's still pretty funny, but I also don't mind people attempting to push me off, I find it more fun and challenging and it gives a sense of competition but idk
    yeah i really feel that sense of competition in the final round there,  really heating up in the final moments
        It's a completely meaningless game with no leaderboards and no real incentive to win besides some skins. You want to win? Great. You want to get revenge and ruin someones game? Sounds good to me.
            You want to win this game? You want to try and play the video game for its intended purpose and challenge yourself to some healthy competition with others? cool

You want to throw your game to fuck someone else over completely? You want to spend 90% of your time going out of your way to upset random people just trying to have fun or carry grudges throughout multiple stages to destroy any sense of competition or fun the final round might have had? Also equally as cool and totally valid and not in any way mean or petty.
                It is quite possible that you take video games way too seriously. If you are that traumatized by a jelly bean trying to make you lose a game *for also trying to make him lose a game* then I think maybe you should reevaluate your priorities.

When you make enemies, anything can happen to you.
                    I don't see the point in exaggerating my annoyance or being reductive about anti-fun brigades in online games, neither of those help the discussion at all.

I think when you're playing an online game with other people you should have the tiniest amount of consideration. 

I don't think taking pleasure in annoying others is a healthy trait nor should it be encouraged, I don't think throwing your game to ruin someone else's is as valid as simply playing the game as intended and I genuinely believe people have every right to question this kind of spiteful behaviour in an all-ages online game when all it does is get them nowhere and get one random other person really confused and annoyed.

I truly do not see the point in feeding such an unhealthy compulsion when you gain nothing but satisfaction from the idea of upsetting someone and the other player is now 2% more stressed out than they need to be while attempting to enjoy the game.

In real life we heavily discourage that sort of behaviour and we still do despite the anonymity that the internet provides
        I wasn't reffering to this video though xd
            that's what I mean, in race rounds pushing and going for elims is fair game as its obviously encouraged, in final modes why literally ruin the whole thing?

One guy gets his free win with basically no effort, one guy has his chance to win removed completely and the last guy is sacrificing his opportunity to win solely to remove the chance of winning from guy 2; the literal only point behind it is petty revenge which is hilarious considering everyone is a number atm and you could easily confuse two identical players for each other and ruin  some poor innocent pirate's game for no reason.
                Oh yeah, I completely agree in that case (not sarcastic)
                Poor innocent pirate, i hope he recovers from this traumatising experience. Shall we make a gofundme page to pay for his therapy sessions?
>So don't be a salty bitch.

Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you, the definition of irony.
    Honestly, I mostly agreed with his point. I was gonna upvote. Then I read that line and I went from upvote to downvote.
        I don't even agree with his point. You take your future into your own hands when you grief people, even if it's strategic to do so. Especially if you're in a distinguishing outfit.

People hold grudges. And this is coming from someone that works hard at murdering people on certain levels. I also target people who were being grabby on other levels. Sometimes you get killed for it and you just accept it and move on to the next.
    It's more like I watched this video and literally can't understand how some people feel fulfilment in this sort of "revenge" because from my perspective if you hold this kind of a grudge over multiple rounds and even are willing to lose yourself in order to screw someone else over then you're just a salty bitch.

I don't really care how many downvotes my comments get here. This is still my opinion.

I'm done replying to this thread though because clearly redditors think I'm wrong in this no matter what, so I'm not going waste any more of my time and mental health on this.
        You're taking this game and thread way too seriously if it's that taxing on your mental health.
        Spends 41 minutes acting like a salty bitch while accusing OP of being a salty bitch. LMFAO.
            everyone here is name-calling and acting like a salty-bitch, myself included, so you don't really have the right to say shit like that as if it isn't the exact way everyone else is behaving over a game
                The only guy acting like a salty bitch is the guy I replied to. Everyone else in this thread is making fun of him. But thanks for incorrecting me lol.
                    ah I see, your definition of "salty bitch" doesn't include yourself or people who agree with you despite behaving almost identically to the people you're dog-piling on.

Very convenient
                        LMFAO are you actually white-knighting the guy acting like a salty bitch? Congrats, this is a new level of simp I haven't seen yet.
                            it took you a shockingly brief amount of time to call me a Simp lmao

It's literally like wrapping my 'W' in a pretty little box with rhinestones and ribbons and then kissing it and handing it to me in a maid outfit, seriously was there not one single better word you could think of in the English language to call someone over a disagreement relating to a colourful rainbow party game.
                                LMFAO sure keep defending the guy who was so salty his comment got deleted by the mods. I'm sure he appreciates your white-knighting efforts, simp.

And why am I not surprised you're bitching about the OP elsewhere in this thread? LMFAO your sodium levels are as high as the guy you're white-knighting.

Sure, keep pretending you won. The whole thread knows who the real salty bitches are in this thread anyway no matter how much you try to hide behind "I'm not owned, I'm not owned!"
        It's a good thing you're going to stop replying because you're the only annoying dickwad here.
        Ok.
        >  then you're just a salty bitch.


> I'm not going waste any more of my mental health on this.

I hope you can see the irony yourself.
        Welcome in reddit, you can't have opinions
            The guy is right in his own way , I mostly find joy when winning , this game is fun but its even more when you win , and sabotaging yourself for the pirate bean not to win is not worth it for me , but the pirate definitely learned a lesson for his unfair plays
                unfair? why do you think they put grabbing in the game?

Not for people to kamikaze and throw their game to ruin someone else's too, but as one extra tool at your disposal to add some kind of strategy and contest to the game. 

I'd say grabbing is one of the least unfair things as everyone can do it but can be easily countered by jumping and diving as well as basic human nature dictating that 99% of players aren't just going to grab you for no reason and put themselves behind.
                    What he did wasnt grabbing , he was standing in the middle of the way on those yellow bridges , maybe it doesnt seem fair to you but implicitly its not something that needs to be encouraged
                        I simply jump and dive over them, 80% success rate
                            Can you ? Its hard to find balance when walking on these poles , cant imagine how it is diving over , for sure you would fall off no ?
                                Sometimes I do but diving is the same as walking on those; if you do it in a straight line you shouldn't lose balance
                i don't understand why people think what the pirate is doing is unfair. falling to someone blocking the pole like that is pretty nooby, you can either push them off the pole or just jump and dive over them.

if i were OP i would have just dived over the head of the pirate at the end of the course and killed him there.

the guy who called him a salty bitch was being pretty rude about it but i mostly agree with him. i would rather try to kill the guy who bullied me or one-up him by winning the crown himself. i don't see the satisfaction in griefing that guy and yourself for petty revenge.
                    I agree totally thats not a way to get revenge since you are jeoparding your chances of winning , but Slime Climb is hard and stressful enough that blocking the pole to access the next floor is maybe not unfair but its totally not fair , Lose Lose situation for both players
Sounds like you're the salty one. I'm just having fun getting my revenge and avenging the other beans.
    Ignore that guy, tosspot.

I always knock people off on slime climb and any other chance I get and thought your video was hilarious.

I'd not even be angry if it happened to me, that's the game. Bean and be beaned.
    Glad you're having fun without getting wins.
        I've got enough wins to keep me happy. Sounds like you're taking this game too seriously.
            says the guy who took enough offense to a beam patroller to sabotage his own finals lol
                Lol I stand by what I did. He had to learn his lesson the hard way.
            Nah I just find this sort of idea of "revenge" where you're only costing your own win petty and childish. I'd have forgotten about the guy within seconds.
                I can't believe there's already elitists like you in this game. I'm just here sharing the fun I'm having and you immediately shit on it.
                    not holding a grudge and not going out of your way to spite them isn't elitism lmao
                    Already said I'm glad you're having fun without getting wins. I wasn't being sarcastic.

The way I have fun in this game is by winning. If I had done the exact thing you did in the video I would not have felt good about it at all because I clearly would have cost my win.
                        And as we all know, winning is the only thing that matters.
                            i mean in the finals, yes... it is.
                            winning because you had a better run than everyone else in the lobby feels good. you also get rewarded. 

in my opinion the way to get revenge on the pirate that would actually feel satisfying would be by beating him. maybe if you want to be petty grab him before he can grab the crown and take it. but i agree with the guy you're replying to, just sacrificing your ability to win on the final round because someone was playing smart earlier just feels like petty revenge. you didn't outplay him, you didn't deny him the crown and show him he lost because he didn't kill you before. if the third bean was your friend and you were just gifting him a win that would be different though.
                        If you think only winning is fun then you should just hack the game, and have all the fun collecting crowns without any effort :)

                                I love how you claim him to be childish in a child’s games. Like wtf. That’s like a acussing someone for being a fucking adult when doing taxes.
    wouldnt a much better revenge be to.. you know.. win the fall mountain?

all youre doing is literally giving the guy credit that hes so much better than you that it takes 2 people teaming to be able to beat him.
        No cause this was way more satisfying to me. Besides, why go for something you MIGHT have a shot at when you could go for something guaranteed like dragging this bean down with me? I already had enough wins to keep me happy anyways.
            Because its dumb.   Theres going to be beam patrollers in literally every game pretty soon.  Have fun never winning again and "teaching everyone a lesson" lol.
                I literally won 3 games after this. What you find dumb I find fun and that's okay. I saw my shot and took it and this'll probably never happen again so I'm happy.
                You're really missing the writing on the wall
Lol you're the salty pirate bean in the video, aren't ya?
Dude you literally don't have to troll / block other players to win, the game automatically already narrows down the player pool with every single round
lmao downvoted for pointing out a valid strategy compared to a bitch-move ruining the fun for every single person in the game
I got downvoted today for having the exact opposite opinion as this. Reddit sure is a fickle place.
It's funny and that's all that matters.

        What goes around comes around? You can feel free to block people's progress in this game (it is a Battle Royale) you just have to be prepared for any consequences that may come your way.
I fucking hate everyone who plays this game so he deserved it. I hope he fucking cried about it.
Some people sabotage others for fun and others sabotage saboteurs for fun. Idk if something like that is worthy of being called a 'toxic revenge quest' lmao
Not a smart play to push people off, it’s not gonna change how many people you’re facing in the next round and it only hurts you and your victims day
    He said slime climb. It absolutely does change how many people you are going to face next round. If you sit on the yellow beam you can kill at least 5 people for free

        Is this a reference I don't understand or are you just some comedic genius?
            There's a video of Tony Hawk criticising skating in movies and Spiderman 3 featured. He wasn't impressed with the fake skating. I had recently watched it.

        You seem to be confusing Netflix with Nutflix.
        Mad
    I asume at first you got downvoted, because you know, feminists. The funny thing is how some people get so butthirt about their "fights" and campaigns and seem to believe that being gay/black/trans makes you a so much better and more interesting person when in some cases seems to be just what describes them and their only trait
        People don't believe being gay black or trans makes you more interesting. Its just representation in media for groups who haven't had much at all outside of joke side characters and grave fillers.
        What? This has nothing to do with feminists lmao

It’s just a joke about Netflix writers

Did you ever win before?
Subjective. 

I don't have fun doing such things, but you do you, no shade.
Man, how many people here hate griefers, but then get excited when Alpharad or some other YouTuber does that exact thing? Why hate people for playing the game?

lol the downvotes are hillarious, some of you take this game way too seriously
    This happens on every game subreddit. People playing the game in a way the masses deem wrong get shit on constantly so everybody can have some faux sense of being a good person
Absolute chad. Keep it up king.
No they don’t. I can tell you’re pissed
    I can tell you're pissed.

Actually I can't because it's reddit and I don't know you.
        Good man. Stay safe.
My first win was result of me eliminating a lot of people in slime climb, which resulted in a 4 man hex a gone.

    I literally never knew this. The amount of the times where I made it to the last level only to just bump my head onto the crown...
        It’s says it during the loading screen AND reminds you at the top of your screen in game to grab the crown using R2
    i lost what would have been my first win just because i didn’t know u have to grab it
    I got a win 2 days ago because 4 people in front of me didn't grab the crown when they jumped at it...
    I really don't understand this requirement. It doesn't up the skill level. It's just a new mechanic introduced in a loading screen and in small text up in the corner. It's a very strange design decision.
        It means you can't dive for the crown (since you can't grab while diving), so it does slightly change the game.
            I made a dive for it my first and, to this day, only time making it up there before anyone else, and I bonked my head.

Just realized why I didn't win then.
                I dived too! RIP
            The dive wouldn't always be the best option anyway since it lowers your character's collision box, and thus would prevent you from touching the crown if it's a bit too high, whereas a normal jump would reach it.

Removing the need to grab would add the need to decide whether you dive or jump, and also would fix all the bugs related to grabbing the crown (there are a lot). IMO it's a win-win. It's an arbitrary requirement that only steals wins from new players anyway.
            I’ve head butted the crown twice now I never knew you couldn’t dive and grab
            Wait what? That explains all the fall mountain losses I’ve had lol
        Idk it feels pretty logical. Bean that gets his hands to the final object first wins. If getting to the top would be the only thing that matters it would just be a finish line.
        I think they did it for publicity. It's funny to watch someone go for their first win, and not realize they need to grab.
    No shit? You just saved me so many last games
I got to the top 10 about 7 times yesterday and every s i n g l e time it was tip toe. I’m going to commit war crimes
    A tip for tip toe if you are on pc, if you have a bug where you slide around a lot on the tiles, turn off your vsync. Works wonders.
        Wasn't there a patch for that physics bug?
            Idk
>4/5 times it was fall ball

&#x200B;

I feel like 9 of the 10 players are made out of marsh mellows and one guy is a brick unit that smashes the ball... One day there will be a no team mode and we shall rejoice.
    A solo mode only option is the one thing this games needs most tbh.


Don't remove the modes but don't force me to play them when I don't want to.
Why?  That game mode almost always feels like a skill based competition, rather than a luck based one, to me.
    Coming on this sub for the first time was so sad, fall ball is the BEST and everyone hates it. Any team games with balls are my favorite for sure
        The problem is one team is always uneven and gets fucked because of it
            I totally get that
                [deleted]
                    Dude, I hit the ball and my guy just falls over... I don't like anh of the ball games besides Rock 'N' Roll
        The uneven nature get me more than my feelings for the game. If there is an uneven number dont do a team game
    Because whether or not I get skilled team mates is the lucky part
        That's...every game ever though, right?
            No? Not the solo games, or games where you can choose your team.
If it makes you feel any better, they are releasing a patch sometime this week to fix uneven teams
I have legit played Tip Toe over 20 games in a row the last couple of days. I'm so over that stupid game mode.
I got fucking uneven team fall ball I shit you not 15 times in a row when it should have just gone to a finale. It's long boring team based and frustrating. Fuck fall ball, that game mode needs to be taken out back and shot

Fuck Royal fumble too
Cry me a riiiver
you know, that would actually be funnier than a 4v5 fall ball
Absolutely! Luckily Fall Guys is such a happy little fun game I don't get too salty at least for too long.
I had a 17 man Hex-a-gone.

IT. WAS. GLORIOUS.
    18 was the most I've played. It's a complete no skill ultra shit show. 


Been hoping to have it again ever since.
It's not the same thing. 

Trying to eliminate as many players as you can in Slime climb is fine. 


What OP did wasn't fine, giving up your own chances of winning so you can grief someone isn't cool. OP was just petty and a lot more toxic than the pirate for basically no reason and i absolutly don't understand why people upvote this post. It would be completly different story if OP killed him in slime climb, that would be funny.
    LOL so its OK to grief others as long as you win, but you can't grief others at your own expense?  Get real.

I have far more fun griefing griefers than going for the win (and more success).  I've gone so far as to hold on to griefers on that block dodging map so we both get pushed off.  How is that any worse than just pushing him off?  Does it take less skill to sacrifice myself?  Sure.  Is it fair.  Of course it is.  Its hilarious that griefers have a code of honor about griefing.
        There are obviously multiple levels of griefing and some are more ok than others, don't know what's so hard to understand. Griefing doesn't have to necessarily be a bad thing and can be fun.

Giving up your chances of winning because you want to target grief someone is so much worse than pushing random people because you want to eliminate them.
            Fair enough.  However, those who seek to purposely eliminate others can't possible expect that those other players will not be upset and seek revenge.
                That's true, you will make other players angry and angry people aren't usually very rational.

I just think behavior like in this clip shouldn't be glorified, you are not some saint who killed evil, you got mad and did something stupid. Someone pushed you? Push him back, don't try to completly destroy him no matter the costs.
    I mean, if he griefed, he can get griefed too
    I have a problem with the slime Climb beam blocking because all it does is eliminate beans that spawned in the back. It’s not like the blocker was better, they spawned in an advantageous spot.
        I am not exactly sure how it works, but aren't spawns based on previous rounds?
            No they’re random
    Trying to eliminate players in races IS griefing. 🤦‍♂️
        Griefing doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing. 

Pushing random people with intended mechanic is good griefing, it's just a bit of fun. Some levels would be very boring without griefing, Roll Out for example.

Giving up your chances of winning because you want to completly destroy 1 person is bad and toxic.
            The issue here is that you're drawing the line between what is griefing to you and what isn't and that's an arguable line and most people don't see it as such.

You cannot simply say, "well, this griefing is okay and this one isn't" because griefing is griefing. 

Also, who's to say that the person gave up his chances? For the majority of the race, he was straight behind him for a potential chance to win if the hammers or balls hit Pirate any harder.

As you said, "it's just a bit of fun". If you're going to grief, you have zero right to complain about getting griefed back, regardless of whether or not its final game.
                No, the issue is you are not capable of thinking about griefing as something not horrible.

If you are still trying to win I don't care what you do, that's it. I am not trying to set some hypothetical line between good griefing and bad griefing, it's extremly simple. If you make it your life mission to destroy someone because he pushed you once, you are dumb. If everyone stopped griefing, this game would be boring. Some levels like Roll out wouldn't be nearly as fun as they are now.


And please don't even try to argue player in this clip was trying to win, he very obviously wasn't, he literally waited for that pirate every time he was ahead of him.
                    > No, the issue is you are not capable of thinking about griefing as something not horrible.

No, I never implied that. The logic is that if you grief someone, expect to be griefed back. It's that simple. It seems you're the one that isn't capable of grasping that.

This has no merit on whether or not its strategic or causing yourself the loss.
                        Again, you completly ignore my point. You can't just say griefing Is griefing, it doesn't work like that, just because it's called griefing doesn't mean it's the same thing.

I wouldn't expect you to steal my phone because i stole your chicken wing. I would expect you to steal my chicken nugget. You are basically saying I should expect you to steal everything because i stole from you and it's fine because stealing is stealing.

It's the same with griefing, I would expect you to try to push me after I pushed you, I wouldnt expect to make an enemy for life because i pushed you. 

Of course it's not forbbiden, people can do that, but it's very unreasonable toxic behavior and shouldn't be glorified like people do in this post.
                            > I wouldn't expect you to steal my phone because i stole your chicken wing. I would expect you to steal my chicken nugget. 

Well, that's where you're wrong. You shouldn't expect someone to do you wrong at the same level because you did them wrong.

That's like saying I shouldn't expect you to steal -anything- from me, and you did, so therefore, don't expect me to steal whatever equivalent you have because -you- cause the neutrality to tip in the first place. That logic is linear to the overall toxicity.
    Shouldn't be downvoted. Slime climb eliminating is all fun and games but targeted griefing is totally uncalled for
        You forgot the /s

I always target the asshat and I've seen a few more people do the same.  The community is allowed to retaliate in any way they see fit.  You want to grief?  I want to make Fall Guys a place of peace and harmony.
            We all want a positive gaming community and that is what we're steering towards but the grab function exists to mess around with others. It's a core gameplay mechanic. I can't stop anyone from being a dickhead and petty towards someone who uses this mechanic but it shouldn't be praised.

EDIT: Thanks for the downvotes guys. Very constructive.
"Help Win" is not the correct way to say it btw. You can win Slime Climb without eliminating the other competition. That's what he was doing.

&#x200B;

However, if you do eliminate the other competition, expect other beans to be fucking pissed at you. Yes, valid strategy to thin out the herd, but you're still an asshole. Slime Climb is hard enough without pirate beans.
    How did it not help him? Isn't it a lot easier to win Fall mountain or other final rounds with 3 people than it is with 10 people?
        ChainChump said

> Using game mechanics to help win an individual game isn't toxic lol. 

Eliminating people doesn't help you win the individual game of Slime Climb. You can win Slime Climb by focusing on yourself.   


It is a valid strategy for thinning the herd but it doesn't guarantee your victory.
            People want to act like there's no social aspect to this game, but that's impossible for any game where humans interact. If you want to focus on ensuring failure in others in order to increase your odds, that is an acceptable strategy. It's not morally wrong or anything. But you're gonna want to enter revenge into your calculus of how the game is gonna go.
                Live by the grab, die by the grab.
    If you get mad at people killing you in fall guys, that’s just silly
        It's a valid strategy. Doesn't mean I don't love to see them get taken out the same way they took out others or myself.
            Live by the sword die by the sword
                Live by the yeet, die by the yeet.
        I don't get mad. I get even.
    People are acting like this game isn't a battle royale lol
Bruh this isn’t a sweaty game
Just because it's a competition doesn't mean someone can't be toxic. The pirate was standing in the one spot on the whole map that can block everyone else and cause them to die, just so he could eliminate all of them. It might be part of the game, but it is definitely toxic.
    i agree, its part of the game and okay do it if you wanna that much, but dont expect people to treat you nice after you're doing this.
    You guys are hilarious lol. It's all part of the fun. You're not MLG Pro gamers.
        Wouldn’t the pirates attempt to block everyone from winning be the actual MLG move? Everyone else just wants to actually play the game.
            The dude stopped for a few seconds. Relax. You guys are calling him a toxic gamer like he's spewing racist threats and aimbotting. I can't believe how bent out of shape you're all being over this.
            Dude it’s a game where you play as a bean and run obstacles. They added grab as a fun mechanic. The point of the game is to have fun.
                Some of us don’t have a lot of time to play. If I can only afford an hour of game time a day I want to spend it actually playing the game.
    Not to mention how toxic everyone else is for trying to win the game. We really should restart concentration camps for people like that
EDIT: you people are beyond help
        What the fuck is wrong with you?
It's a race. Just go cross the finish line. You don't see people in the Olympics trying to trip each other. The anonymity of the internet brings out peoples true personalities.
    Why do you think they added the mechanic? It’s fun. It’s suppose to the fun.
        I just think it's funny that people get so bent out of shape over a game mechanic. Yeah I get why you dont like it it's not exactly fun to be on the receiving end of a grab that eliminates you but for some people it's part of the fun.  People are so desperate to have their cake and eat it too. By this subs definition of toxic, targeting the losing team in Egg Scramble is probably toxic as well but I never see anyone play any other way. Its just a silly game get over it.
            100 percent on board. It’s supposed to be a silly, fun game. Plus you get sweet karma vids lol. I guarantee that the person who was who grabbing in the OP post wasn’t upset they lost lol.
the problem with this is people not minding their own business and gang up on YOU because they walk over and see you knocking XYZ over a cliff and think you are the aggressor.
thats how i play this game, i like to screw over people knowing that if they survive they might give everything up just for revenge, i really don't know why people get so mad over this, i am just playing the game in my own way, i am not hacking or anything
    Yep, I die plenty of times trying to be a dick. It's part of the fun.
        Yes! I will be in stitches from trying to fuck some one over and end up sending myself into oblivion. And then i get right back into another game a minute later. 

There are a lot of babies on this thread through. I'm definitely going to be grabbing players more often. 

Its a party game, with a grab mechanic, which is fun. Stop trying to make everything a PVE game. A little pvp makes everything better.
            My biggest attitude shift has been in the game Roll Out. I used to just mind my business and go back and forth. It would be very rare if I didn't qualify but now I run around like an ass trying to shove people off. This has probably doubled my chances of being eliminated but it's now chaotic fun and a course I enjoy rather than it being a chore.
                It also has doubled your fun i bet. The games people just run back and forth and try not to fall off the platform is too many. The grabbing on that stage adds a ton of fun.
                    Yep, I usually go dizzy trying to adjust the camera though. That's usually how I fall through.
I think him waiting at the finish line proves he was trying to troll.  I don’t feel bad at all for him.
    You can knock people off at the end too. Notice how many people they had in their fall mountain, and why. Now ask yourself if the Pirate gave himself better odds to win.
        He absolutely did and I have no problem with it.  I just find it annoying when I’m on the receiving end and if you play like that you can’t be surprised when someone sabotages your win.
ok :(
Where do you donate your money?
    Red cross
I do do that instead. Instead, it's called Watsi and it crowd funds healthcare for people around the world. Instead of them staying sick they get help.
I'm super envious, haha, slime is my absolute favorite, but it never trims the numbers quite that well in my lobbies. Maybe one day.

Also yeah rough day for the other person there...
I have never seen a single digit slimb climb. its usually something like 21 people and 17 make it through with 2-3 of the knockouts being from griefers. Are you on PS4?
I hate the hit box ones. Their net code is meh
    It doesn’t help that my internet is garbage either
I hate it cuz I never won.  The level design is very good it's just sooo hard for me I rage quit the game.
    Lol yes it's hard but ngl even tho it's hard it's the best map.
Does trying to win inherently take away fun from the game? I've been knocked out plenty of times and taken it in good fun, it's part of the game. But I see throwing as strictly salty and/or counter fun. OP says people are taking the game too seriously, but I'd say it's the other way round.
    It does if you take away the fun from other people. In general, it's not fun when you are immobilized, in any fashion, whether by gameplay mechanic or other player. You are free to do it but you should also accept the consequences of those actions.

Also, I'd say the pirate is exploiting a design flaw in the level. It's the only place in the whole game where one person can bottleneck a level from everyone else. There really isn't a good way around it and the situation is very unbalanced towards the player camping that spot.
        >It does if you take away the fun from other people. In general, it's not fun when you are immobilized, in any fashion, whether by gameplay mechanic or other player. You are free to do it but you should also accept the consequences of those actions.

Nonetheless it's part of the game though. If you weren't meant to be able to grab/block people it wouldn't be there? I think people are ready to accept the consequences, because you can easily get punished for doing any of these things. But I think throwing is a step too far.

>Also, I'd say the pirate is exploiting a design flaw in the level. It's the only place in the whole game where one person can bottleneck a level from everyone else. There really isn't a good way around it and the situation is very unbalanced towards the player camping that spot.

It's not that hard to get around it though. I'd say the flaw is in the start more so than that part, because at least if it was skill alone that got you there first that'd be better. But the developers haven't really said anything against this part, and even embraced the memes.
            Sure, it's part of the game, but that doesn't necessarily means it's a good thing. If a large number of people don't enjoy it then, maybe it is worth taking another look at it. I'd say one way to make it more balanced is if the players pop apart, the grabbing player is the one that is moved back. A small change that would make it less of a griefing tactic.

It's not easy to punish if you are eliminated as the result of the action. Or you get stuck in a stalemate where you are both grabbing each other while everyone else runs on by. Plus many cases of counteracting usually results in the player sacrificing themselves.

For slime climb in particular, it's unbalanced to have one player have so much of an effect on everyone else. A simple solution is to have it go from 3 beams to 2, instead of 2 to 1.

And just because the devs haven't said anything doesn't mean that they don't acknowledge it or that if they don't acknowledge it, that it's not a problem.
                >Sure, it's part of the game, but that doesn't necessarily means it's a good thing. If a large number of people don't enjoy it then, maybe it is worth taking another look at it.

That's fair, but I'd personally be disappointed if they did that. Imagine the game with no collisions, no grabbing.. sounds pretty boring to me.

&#x200B;

>I'd say one way to make it more balanced is if the players pop apart, the grabbing player is the one that is moved back. A small change that would make it less of a griefing tactic.

I'm getting the impression that you're not a fan of people trying to knock anyone out at all? People being pushed back by grabbing is one of the main ways to knock someone out. It's not "griefing" if it's part of the game. I mean you're meant to knock people out, whether you do that by completing the course quickly or otherwise, so I don't get how it's griefing.

&#x200B;

>It's not easy to punish if you are eliminated as the result of the action. Or you get stuck in a stalemate where you are both grabbing each other while everyone else runs on by. Plus many cases of counteracting usually results in the player sacrificing themselves.

Why would you be able to punish someone that eliminates you? If you got eliminated you got outplayed, that's all there is to it. If you're both stuck and both fail intentionally then I guess that's a throw and bad? If you hold someone back and still try to survive I don't think there's anything wrong with that. If you try to counteract a grab and sacrifice yourself then you've been outplayed.

&#x200B;

>For slime climb in particular, it's unbalanced to have one player have so much of an effect on everyone else. A simple solution is to have it go from 3 beams to 2, instead of 2 to 1.

Again I don't think it's that hard to get around it but I'd be open to that idea. You only need someone else to do it alongside you though.
                    I never said no collisions or grabbing. But I think grabbing has too much of a low risk/high reward. That's why making you the one that pops back if you grab evens it out. Note that you can also just walk into people to push them. It's about balance. And just because you came out on top doesn't mean you outplayed someone. Of all games, this game should teach you that.

Ultimately, it's about fun and I don't agree that winning = fun. Some of the most boring game types are the ones that I never get eliminated from (like perfect match or the one with the rotating cylinders). A lot of the un-funness in this game revolves around not running around so being locked in someone's grip is not really something I find enjoyable.

And as for me personally, it's not an issue as I'm rarely in these situations but as far as game mechanics go, there is room for a bit of fine tuning.
                    You're right about everything but that bottleneck in slime climb shouldn't be there.
You assume the point of the game is to win.  Perhaps there are other goals.
    Some people like to win, others to have fun, i have fun screwing people over and even getting screwed over, i don't see why playing the game in a non toxic way is a issue
    ...like to piss other players off?? Which is what both OP and the pirate were doing???
Why are you gatekeeping the way people play this game? If it's fun for them then let it be. Don't get too angry over petty things like this.
    OP is the one gatekeeping how people play the game legitimately, that’s the point. I knock people off in slimb climb to improve my odds of winning. Now I have to worry some asshole was so salty about it he’s going to throw the entire match just to stop me from winning? Like dude, they got a 3 man fall mountain because of the Pirate. If that doesn’t prove it’s competitively viable I don’t know what does. If I was OP I would have won the final instead of sabotaging. Clearly a lack of confidence
He wasn't being shitty. He was playing the game. Are you trying to tell me you haven't knocked anyone out on purpose? Because if you have, get off your high horse.
    [deleted]
        No, the point is winning the match. Eliminating 10 people and still qualifying is really easy and efficient.
            [deleted]
                griefing in this game is almost always not worth it hahahaha

every time anyone griefs they become the target in the lobby. there was once a toucan griefing at that exact spot in slime climb and everyone in the lobby made it their life mission to ensure that toucan. i ended up with the dub because i didn’t get involved!
                So in egg scramble you don’t target the team with the least amount of eggs? Sounds like using your advantage to screw other people to me.

    Griefing is being shitty while playing the game
        There's nothing shitty about strategically eliminating enough people to skip straight to the final round, and improve your odds of winning. I know I've personally gotten crowns from knocking people off the beam because 4 man Fall Mountain is much easier than 13 man Fall Mountain. Apparently you're all too simple to understand strategy, though. It's a Battle Royale and nobody seems to understand what that entails.
You didn't just let someone else win, you also prevented someone from winning out of some kind of misguided sense of justice. If other people in the community start doing this type of shit then we get real toxicity. Stand by your dumb logic if you want, and enjoy the upvotes from all the shit players who don't know how to perform the simple task of getting around a dude blocking a beam.
    Jeez dude you're getting a bit too hostile over a game this casual. Were you the pirate skin I held back?
        > Jeez dude you're getting a bit too hostile over a game this casual

you posted a video of you getting pure revenge on someone in another map after they did a competitively helpful move...where is your ability for self reflection lol
            Lol I'll give you that but I'd argue this guy is a bit more into this game than I am.
        \*Posts video of hostile act in game\*  


\*Calls someone out for being hostile over a few words\*
            Live by the troll die by the troll.  You can't get mad at someone trolling you if you're being a huge asshole first.
            Hostile isn't the right word I'll admit that. How about taking this game way too seriously given the content of the game? Tone it down a bit man you're getting angry over something that's not worth it.
                You must be the 5 year old this game is targeted to. Jeez man. You're acting like a child
Because causing someone to lose, just like pirate caused all those people to lose, is fun. That’s what the game is about. Winning isn’t everything
    Yea that’s my point, so why’s OP salty about it? The pirate caused everyone to lose and OP went and did it too. It’s all in good fun
Pirate was just playing the game. His methods of coming out on top we're also done in a fun way, whereas OP's methods was to just be salty and weren't within the spirit of the game
    "fun way"
    Completely agree, the aim of the game is to win by any means necessary which the pirate tried to do. OP just threw and ruined the game for himself and someone else
[removed]
    Pardon? 

I didn't contradict my point in any way, because my point is only 'anything's fair game' lol.

It's cute how insanely salty you are anyways. You sure you don't wanna say some more stuff? C'mon, type some more.
        [removed]
            You say that and yet you replied again, nice to see you again. :)

You got me, I do have ADHD actually, pal, would you like to rant on it a bit more? Get it all out there we're here for you.
Not petty revenge. Justice.
    Yeah man, throwing a match is totally getting justice against someone who was strategically trying to win. Cool.
        Obviously stopping the asshat who played like a douche was more important. He's free to play like a douche, I'm free to be satisfied by being an instrument of karmic justice.
yeah i really feel that sense of competition in the final round there,  really heating up in the final moments
    It's a completely meaningless game with no leaderboards and no real incentive to win besides some skins. You want to win? Great. You want to get revenge and ruin someones game? Sounds good to me.
        You want to win this game? You want to try and play the video game for its intended purpose and challenge yourself to some healthy competition with others? cool

You want to throw your game to fuck someone else over completely? You want to spend 90% of your time going out of your way to upset random people just trying to have fun or carry grudges throughout multiple stages to destroy any sense of competition or fun the final round might have had? Also equally as cool and totally valid and not in any way mean or petty.
            It is quite possible that you take video games way too seriously. If you are that traumatized by a jelly bean trying to make you lose a game *for also trying to make him lose a game* then I think maybe you should reevaluate your priorities.

When you make enemies, anything can happen to you.
                I don't see the point in exaggerating my annoyance or being reductive about anti-fun brigades in online games, neither of those help the discussion at all.

I think when you're playing an online game with other people you should have the tiniest amount of consideration. 

I don't think taking pleasure in annoying others is a healthy trait nor should it be encouraged, I don't think throwing your game to ruin someone else's is as valid as simply playing the game as intended and I genuinely believe people have every right to question this kind of spiteful behaviour in an all-ages online game when all it does is get them nowhere and get one random other person really confused and annoyed.

I truly do not see the point in feeding such an unhealthy compulsion when you gain nothing but satisfaction from the idea of upsetting someone and the other player is now 2% more stressed out than they need to be while attempting to enjoy the game.

In real life we heavily discourage that sort of behaviour and we still do despite the anonymity that the internet provides
    I wasn't reffering to this video though xd
        that's what I mean, in race rounds pushing and going for elims is fair game as its obviously encouraged, in final modes why literally ruin the whole thing?

One guy gets his free win with basically no effort, one guy has his chance to win removed completely and the last guy is sacrificing his opportunity to win solely to remove the chance of winning from guy 2; the literal only point behind it is petty revenge which is hilarious considering everyone is a number atm and you could easily confuse two identical players for each other and ruin  some poor innocent pirate's game for no reason.
            Oh yeah, I completely agree in that case (not sarcastic)
            Poor innocent pirate, i hope he recovers from this traumatising experience. Shall we make a gofundme page to pay for his therapy sessions?
Honestly, I mostly agreed with his point. I was gonna upvote. Then I read that line and I went from upvote to downvote.
    I don't even agree with his point. You take your future into your own hands when you grief people, even if it's strategic to do so. Especially if you're in a distinguishing outfit.

People hold grudges. And this is coming from someone that works hard at murdering people on certain levels. I also target people who were being grabby on other levels. Sometimes you get killed for it and you just accept it and move on to the next.
It's more like I watched this video and literally can't understand how some people feel fulfilment in this sort of "revenge" because from my perspective if you hold this kind of a grudge over multiple rounds and even are willing to lose yourself in order to screw someone else over then you're just a salty bitch.

I don't really care how many downvotes my comments get here. This is still my opinion.

I'm done replying to this thread though because clearly redditors think I'm wrong in this no matter what, so I'm not going waste any more of my time and mental health on this.
    You're taking this game and thread way too seriously if it's that taxing on your mental health.
    Spends 41 minutes acting like a salty bitch while accusing OP of being a salty bitch. LMFAO.
        everyone here is name-calling and acting like a salty-bitch, myself included, so you don't really have the right to say shit like that as if it isn't the exact way everyone else is behaving over a game
            The only guy acting like a salty bitch is the guy I replied to. Everyone else in this thread is making fun of him. But thanks for incorrecting me lol.
                ah I see, your definition of "salty bitch" doesn't include yourself or people who agree with you despite behaving almost identically to the people you're dog-piling on.

Very convenient
                    LMFAO are you actually white-knighting the guy acting like a salty bitch? Congrats, this is a new level of simp I haven't seen yet.
                        it took you a shockingly brief amount of time to call me a Simp lmao

It's literally like wrapping my 'W' in a pretty little box with rhinestones and ribbons and then kissing it and handing it to me in a maid outfit, seriously was there not one single better word you could think of in the English language to call someone over a disagreement relating to a colourful rainbow party game.
                            LMFAO sure keep defending the guy who was so salty his comment got deleted by the mods. I'm sure he appreciates your white-knighting efforts, simp.

And why am I not surprised you're bitching about the OP elsewhere in this thread? LMFAO your sodium levels are as high as the guy you're white-knighting.

Sure, keep pretending you won. The whole thread knows who the real salty bitches are in this thread anyway no matter how much you try to hide behind "I'm not owned, I'm not owned!"
    It's a good thing you're going to stop replying because you're the only annoying dickwad here.
    Ok.
    >  then you're just a salty bitch.


> I'm not going waste any more of my mental health on this.

I hope you can see the irony yourself.
    Welcome in reddit, you can't have opinions
        The guy is right in his own way , I mostly find joy when winning , this game is fun but its even more when you win , and sabotaging yourself for the pirate bean not to win is not worth it for me , but the pirate definitely learned a lesson for his unfair plays
            unfair? why do you think they put grabbing in the game?

Not for people to kamikaze and throw their game to ruin someone else's too, but as one extra tool at your disposal to add some kind of strategy and contest to the game. 

I'd say grabbing is one of the least unfair things as everyone can do it but can be easily countered by jumping and diving as well as basic human nature dictating that 99% of players aren't just going to grab you for no reason and put themselves behind.
                What he did wasnt grabbing , he was standing in the middle of the way on those yellow bridges , maybe it doesnt seem fair to you but implicitly its not something that needs to be encouraged
                    I simply jump and dive over them, 80% success rate
                        Can you ? Its hard to find balance when walking on these poles , cant imagine how it is diving over , for sure you would fall off no ?
                            Sometimes I do but diving is the same as walking on those; if you do it in a straight line you shouldn't lose balance
            i don't understand why people think what the pirate is doing is unfair. falling to someone blocking the pole like that is pretty nooby, you can either push them off the pole or just jump and dive over them.

if i were OP i would have just dived over the head of the pirate at the end of the course and killed him there.

the guy who called him a salty bitch was being pretty rude about it but i mostly agree with him. i would rather try to kill the guy who bullied me or one-up him by winning the crown himself. i don't see the satisfaction in griefing that guy and yourself for petty revenge.
                I agree totally thats not a way to get revenge since you are jeoparding your chances of winning , but Slime Climb is hard and stressful enough that blocking the pole to access the next floor is maybe not unfair but its totally not fair , Lose Lose situation for both players
Ignore that guy, tosspot.

I always knock people off on slime climb and any other chance I get and thought your video was hilarious.

I'd not even be angry if it happened to me, that's the game. Bean and be beaned.
Glad you're having fun without getting wins.
    I've got enough wins to keep me happy. Sounds like you're taking this game too seriously.
        says the guy who took enough offense to a beam patroller to sabotage his own finals lol
            Lol I stand by what I did. He had to learn his lesson the hard way.
        Nah I just find this sort of idea of "revenge" where you're only costing your own win petty and childish. I'd have forgotten about the guy within seconds.
            I can't believe there's already elitists like you in this game. I'm just here sharing the fun I'm having and you immediately shit on it.
                not holding a grudge and not going out of your way to spite them isn't elitism lmao
                Already said I'm glad you're having fun without getting wins. I wasn't being sarcastic.

The way I have fun in this game is by winning. If I had done the exact thing you did in the video I would not have felt good about it at all because I clearly would have cost my win.
                    And as we all know, winning is the only thing that matters.
                        i mean in the finals, yes... it is.
                        winning because you had a better run than everyone else in the lobby feels good. you also get rewarded. 

in my opinion the way to get revenge on the pirate that would actually feel satisfying would be by beating him. maybe if you want to be petty grab him before he can grab the crown and take it. but i agree with the guy you're replying to, just sacrificing your ability to win on the final round because someone was playing smart earlier just feels like petty revenge. you didn't outplay him, you didn't deny him the crown and show him he lost because he didn't kill you before. if the third bean was your friend and you were just gifting him a win that would be different though.
                    If you think only winning is fun then you should just hack the game, and have all the fun collecting crowns without any effort :)

wouldnt a much better revenge be to.. you know.. win the fall mountain?

all youre doing is literally giving the guy credit that hes so much better than you that it takes 2 people teaming to be able to beat him.
    No cause this was way more satisfying to me. Besides, why go for something you MIGHT have a shot at when you could go for something guaranteed like dragging this bean down with me? I already had enough wins to keep me happy anyways.
        Because its dumb.   Theres going to be beam patrollers in literally every game pretty soon.  Have fun never winning again and "teaching everyone a lesson" lol.
            I literally won 3 games after this. What you find dumb I find fun and that's okay. I saw my shot and took it and this'll probably never happen again so I'm happy.

He said slime climb. It absolutely does change how many people you are going to face next round. If you sit on the yellow beam you can kill at least 5 people for free

    People don't believe being gay black or trans makes you more interesting. Its just representation in media for groups who haven't had much at all outside of joke side characters and grave fillers.

Actually I can't because it's reddit and I don't know you.
    Good man. Stay safe.
[removed]
I literally never knew this. The amount of the times where I made it to the last level only to just bump my head onto the crown...
    It’s says it during the loading screen AND reminds you at the top of your screen in game to grab the crown using R2
i lost what would have been my first win just because i didn’t know u have to grab it
I got a win 2 days ago because 4 people in front of me didn't grab the crown when they jumped at it...
I really don't understand this requirement. It doesn't up the skill level. It's just a new mechanic introduced in a loading screen and in small text up in the corner. It's a very strange design decision.
    It means you can't dive for the crown (since you can't grab while diving), so it does slightly change the game.
        I made a dive for it my first and, to this day, only time making it up there before anyone else, and I bonked my head.

Just realized why I didn't win then.
            I dived too! RIP
        The dive wouldn't always be the best option anyway since it lowers your character's collision box, and thus would prevent you from touching the crown if it's a bit too high, whereas a normal jump would reach it.

Removing the need to grab would add the need to decide whether you dive or jump, and also would fix all the bugs related to grabbing the crown (there are a lot). IMO it's a win-win. It's an arbitrary requirement that only steals wins from new players anyway.
        I’ve head butted the crown twice now I never knew you couldn’t dive and grab
        Wait what? That explains all the fall mountain losses I’ve had lol
    Idk it feels pretty logical. Bean that gets his hands to the final object first wins. If getting to the top would be the only thing that matters it would just be a finish line.
    I think they did it for publicity. It's funny to watch someone go for their first win, and not realize they need to grab.
No shit? You just saved me so many last games

        Idk
A solo mode only option is the one thing this games needs most tbh.


Don't remove the modes but don't force me to play them when I don't want to.
Coming on this sub for the first time was so sad, fall ball is the BEST and everyone hates it. Any team games with balls are my favorite for sure
    The problem is one team is always uneven and gets fucked because of it
        I totally get that
            [deleted]
                Dude, I hit the ball and my guy just falls over... I don't like anh of the ball games besides Rock 'N' Roll
    The uneven nature get me more than my feelings for the game. If there is an uneven number dont do a team game
Because whether or not I get skilled team mates is the lucky part
    That's...every game ever though, right?
        No? Not the solo games, or games where you can choose your team.
18 was the most I've played. It's a complete no skill ultra shit show. 


Been hoping to have it again ever since.
LOL so its OK to grief others as long as you win, but you can't grief others at your own expense?  Get real.

I have far more fun griefing griefers than going for the win (and more success).  I've gone so far as to hold on to griefers on that block dodging map so we both get pushed off.  How is that any worse than just pushing him off?  Does it take less skill to sacrifice myself?  Sure.  Is it fair.  Of course it is.  Its hilarious that griefers have a code of honor about griefing.
    There are obviously multiple levels of griefing and some are more ok than others, don't know what's so hard to understand. Griefing doesn't have to necessarily be a bad thing and can be fun.

Giving up your chances of winning because you want to target grief someone is so much worse than pushing random people because you want to eliminate them.
        Fair enough.  However, those who seek to purposely eliminate others can't possible expect that those other players will not be upset and seek revenge.
            That's true, you will make other players angry and angry people aren't usually very rational.

I just think behavior like in this clip shouldn't be glorified, you are not some saint who killed evil, you got mad and did something stupid. Someone pushed you? Push him back, don't try to completly destroy him no matter the costs.
I mean, if he griefed, he can get griefed too
I have a problem with the slime Climb beam blocking because all it does is eliminate beans that spawned in the back. It’s not like the blocker was better, they spawned in an advantageous spot.
    I am not exactly sure how it works, but aren't spawns based on previous rounds?
        No they’re random
Trying to eliminate players in races IS griefing. 🤦‍♂️
    Griefing doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing. 

Pushing random people with intended mechanic is good griefing, it's just a bit of fun. Some levels would be very boring without griefing, Roll Out for example.

Giving up your chances of winning because you want to completly destroy 1 person is bad and toxic.
        The issue here is that you're drawing the line between what is griefing to you and what isn't and that's an arguable line and most people don't see it as such.

You cannot simply say, "well, this griefing is okay and this one isn't" because griefing is griefing. 

Also, who's to say that the person gave up his chances? For the majority of the race, he was straight behind him for a potential chance to win if the hammers or balls hit Pirate any harder.

As you said, "it's just a bit of fun". If you're going to grief, you have zero right to complain about getting griefed back, regardless of whether or not its final game.
            No, the issue is you are not capable of thinking about griefing as something not horrible.

If you are still trying to win I don't care what you do, that's it. I am not trying to set some hypothetical line between good griefing and bad griefing, it's extremly simple. If you make it your life mission to destroy someone because he pushed you once, you are dumb. If everyone stopped griefing, this game would be boring. Some levels like Roll out wouldn't be nearly as fun as they are now.


And please don't even try to argue player in this clip was trying to win, he very obviously wasn't, he literally waited for that pirate every time he was ahead of him.
                > No, the issue is you are not capable of thinking about griefing as something not horrible.

No, I never implied that. The logic is that if you grief someone, expect to be griefed back. It's that simple. It seems you're the one that isn't capable of grasping that.

This has no merit on whether or not its strategic or causing yourself the loss.
                    Again, you completly ignore my point. You can't just say griefing Is griefing, it doesn't work like that, just because it's called griefing doesn't mean it's the same thing.

I wouldn't expect you to steal my phone because i stole your chicken wing. I would expect you to steal my chicken nugget. You are basically saying I should expect you to steal everything because i stole from you and it's fine because stealing is stealing.

It's the same with griefing, I would expect you to try to push me after I pushed you, I wouldnt expect to make an enemy for life because i pushed you. 

Of course it's not forbbiden, people can do that, but it's very unreasonable toxic behavior and shouldn't be glorified like people do in this post.
                        > I wouldn't expect you to steal my phone because i stole your chicken wing. I would expect you to steal my chicken nugget. 

Well, that's where you're wrong. You shouldn't expect someone to do you wrong at the same level because you did them wrong.

That's like saying I shouldn't expect you to steal -anything- from me, and you did, so therefore, don't expect me to steal whatever equivalent you have because -you- cause the neutrality to tip in the first place. That logic is linear to the overall toxicity.
Shouldn't be downvoted. Slime climb eliminating is all fun and games but targeted griefing is totally uncalled for
    You forgot the /s

I always target the asshat and I've seen a few more people do the same.  The community is allowed to retaliate in any way they see fit.  You want to grief?  I want to make Fall Guys a place of peace and harmony.
        We all want a positive gaming community and that is what we're steering towards but the grab function exists to mess around with others. It's a core gameplay mechanic. I can't stop anyone from being a dickhead and petty towards someone who uses this mechanic but it shouldn't be praised.

EDIT: Thanks for the downvotes guys. Very constructive.
How did it not help him? Isn't it a lot easier to win Fall mountain or other final rounds with 3 people than it is with 10 people?

> Using game mechanics to help win an individual game isn't toxic lol. 

Eliminating people doesn't help you win the individual game of Slime Climb. You can win Slime Climb by focusing on yourself.   


It is a valid strategy for thinning the herd but it doesn't guarantee your victory.
        People want to act like there's no social aspect to this game, but that's impossible for any game where humans interact. If you want to focus on ensuring failure in others in order to increase your odds, that is an acceptable strategy. It's not morally wrong or anything. But you're gonna want to enter revenge into your calculus of how the game is gonna go.
            Live by the grab, die by the grab.
If you get mad at people killing you in fall guys, that’s just silly
    It's a valid strategy. Doesn't mean I don't love to see them get taken out the same way they took out others or myself.
        Live by the sword die by the sword
            Live by the yeet, die by the yeet.
    I don't get mad. I get even.
People are acting like this game isn't a battle royale lol
i agree, its part of the game and okay do it if you wanna that much, but dont expect people to treat you nice after you're doing this.
You guys are hilarious lol. It's all part of the fun. You're not MLG Pro gamers.
    Wouldn’t the pirates attempt to block everyone from winning be the actual MLG move? Everyone else just wants to actually play the game.
        The dude stopped for a few seconds. Relax. You guys are calling him a toxic gamer like he's spewing racist threats and aimbotting. I can't believe how bent out of shape you're all being over this.
        Dude it’s a game where you play as a bean and run obstacles. They added grab as a fun mechanic. The point of the game is to have fun.
            Some of us don’t have a lot of time to play. If I can only afford an hour of game time a day I want to spend it actually playing the game.
Not to mention how toxic everyone else is for trying to win the game. We really should restart concentration camps for people like that
EDIT: you people are beyond help
    What the fuck is wrong with you?
Why do you think they added the mechanic? It’s fun. It’s suppose to the fun.
    I just think it's funny that people get so bent out of shape over a game mechanic. Yeah I get why you dont like it it's not exactly fun to be on the receiving end of a grab that eliminates you but for some people it's part of the fun.  People are so desperate to have their cake and eat it too. By this subs definition of toxic, targeting the losing team in Egg Scramble is probably toxic as well but I never see anyone play any other way. Its just a silly game get over it.
        100 percent on board. It’s supposed to be a silly, fun game. Plus you get sweet karma vids lol. I guarantee that the person who was who grabbing in the OP post wasn’t upset they lost lol.
Yep, I die plenty of times trying to be a dick. It's part of the fun.
    Yes! I will be in stitches from trying to fuck some one over and end up sending myself into oblivion. And then i get right back into another game a minute later. 

There are a lot of babies on this thread through. I'm definitely going to be grabbing players more often. 

Its a party game, with a grab mechanic, which is fun. Stop trying to make everything a PVE game. A little pvp makes everything better.
        My biggest attitude shift has been in the game Roll Out. I used to just mind my business and go back and forth. It would be very rare if I didn't qualify but now I run around like an ass trying to shove people off. This has probably doubled my chances of being eliminated but it's now chaotic fun and a course I enjoy rather than it being a chore.
            It also has doubled your fun i bet. The games people just run back and forth and try not to fall off the platform is too many. The grabbing on that stage adds a ton of fun.
                Yep, I usually go dizzy trying to adjust the camera though. That's usually how I fall through.
You can knock people off at the end too. Notice how many people they had in their fall mountain, and why. Now ask yourself if the Pirate gave himself better odds to win.
    He absolutely did and I have no problem with it.  I just find it annoying when I’m on the receiving end and if you play like that you can’t be surprised when someone sabotages your win.
Red cross
It doesn’t help that my internet is garbage either
Lol yes it's hard but ngl even tho it's hard it's the best map.
It does if you take away the fun from other people. In general, it's not fun when you are immobilized, in any fashion, whether by gameplay mechanic or other player. You are free to do it but you should also accept the consequences of those actions.

Also, I'd say the pirate is exploiting a design flaw in the level. It's the only place in the whole game where one person can bottleneck a level from everyone else. There really isn't a good way around it and the situation is very unbalanced towards the player camping that spot.
    >It does if you take away the fun from other people. In general, it's not fun when you are immobilized, in any fashion, whether by gameplay mechanic or other player. You are free to do it but you should also accept the consequences of those actions.

Nonetheless it's part of the game though. If you weren't meant to be able to grab/block people it wouldn't be there? I think people are ready to accept the consequences, because you can easily get punished for doing any of these things. But I think throwing is a step too far.

&#x200B;

>Also, I'd say the pirate is exploiting a design flaw in the level. It's the only place in the whole game where one person can bottleneck a level from everyone else. There really isn't a good way around it and the situation is very unbalanced towards the player camping that spot.

It's not that hard to get around it though. I'd say the flaw is in the start more so than that part, because at least if it was skill alone that got you there first that'd be better. But the developers haven't really said anything against this part, and even embraced the memes.
        Sure, it's part of the game, but that doesn't necessarily means it's a good thing. If a large number of people don't enjoy it then, maybe it is worth taking another look at it. I'd say one way to make it more balanced is if the players pop apart, the grabbing player is the one that is moved back. A small change that would make it less of a griefing tactic.

It's not easy to punish if you are eliminated as the result of the action. Or you get stuck in a stalemate where you are both grabbing each other while everyone else runs on by. Plus many cases of counteracting usually results in the player sacrificing themselves.

For slime climb in particular, it's unbalanced to have one player have so much of an effect on everyone else. A simple solution is to have it go from 3 beams to 2, instead of 2 to 1.

And just because the devs haven't said anything doesn't mean that they don't acknowledge it or that if they don't acknowledge it, that it's not a problem.
            >Sure, it's part of the game, but that doesn't necessarily means it's a good thing. If a large number of people don't enjoy it then, maybe it is worth taking another look at it.

That's fair, but I'd personally be disappointed if they did that. Imagine the game with no collisions, no grabbing.. sounds pretty boring to me.

&#x200B;

>I'd say one way to make it more balanced is if the players pop apart, the grabbing player is the one that is moved back. A small change that would make it less of a griefing tactic.

I'm getting the impression that you're not a fan of people trying to knock anyone out at all? People being pushed back by grabbing is one of the main ways to knock someone out. It's not "griefing" if it's part of the game. I mean you're meant to knock people out, whether you do that by completing the course quickly or otherwise, so I don't get how it's griefing.

&#x200B;

>It's not easy to punish if you are eliminated as the result of the action. Or you get stuck in a stalemate where you are both grabbing each other while everyone else runs on by. Plus many cases of counteracting usually results in the player sacrificing themselves.

Why would you be able to punish someone that eliminates you? If you got eliminated you got outplayed, that's all there is to it. If you're both stuck and both fail intentionally then I guess that's a throw and bad? If you hold someone back and still try to survive I don't think there's anything wrong with that. If you try to counteract a grab and sacrifice yourself then you've been outplayed.

&#x200B;

>For slime climb in particular, it's unbalanced to have one player have so much of an effect on everyone else. A simple solution is to have it go from 3 beams to 2, instead of 2 to 1.

Again I don't think it's that hard to get around it but I'd be open to that idea. You only need someone else to do it alongside you though.
                I never said no collisions or grabbing. But I think grabbing has too much of a low risk/high reward. That's why making you the one that pops back if you grab evens it out. Note that you can also just walk into people to push them. It's about balance. And just because you came out on top doesn't mean you outplayed someone. Of all games, this game should teach you that.

Ultimately, it's about fun and I don't agree that winning = fun. Some of the most boring game types are the ones that I never get eliminated from (like perfect match or the one with the rotating cylinders). A lot of the un-funness in this game revolves around not running around so being locked in someone's grip is not really something I find enjoyable.

And as for me personally, it's not an issue as I'm rarely in these situations but as far as game mechanics go, there is room for a bit of fine tuning.
                You're right about everything but that bottleneck in slime climb shouldn't be there.
Some people like to win, others to have fun, i have fun screwing people over and even getting screwed over, i don't see why playing the game in a non toxic way is a issue
...like to piss other players off?? Which is what both OP and the pirate were doing???
OP is the one gatekeeping how people play the game legitimately, that’s the point. I knock people off in slimb climb to improve my odds of winning. Now I have to worry some asshole was so salty about it he’s going to throw the entire match just to stop me from winning? Like dude, they got a 3 man fall mountain because of the Pirate. If that doesn’t prove it’s competitively viable I don’t know what does. If I was OP I would have won the final instead of sabotaging. Clearly a lack of confidence
[deleted]
    No, the point is winning the match. Eliminating 10 people and still qualifying is really easy and efficient.
        [deleted]
            griefing in this game is almost always not worth it hahahaha

every time anyone griefs they become the target in the lobby. there was once a toucan griefing at that exact spot in slime climb and everyone in the lobby made it their life mission to ensure that toucan. i ended up with the dub because i didn’t get involved!
            So in egg scramble you don’t target the team with the least amount of eggs? Sounds like using your advantage to screw other people to me.
                [deleted]
                    So if I start in the last row am I legally allowed to stand on the beam?

            [deleted]
Griefing is being shitty while playing the game
    There's nothing shitty about strategically eliminating enough people to skip straight to the final round, and improve your odds of winning. I know I've personally gotten crowns from knocking people off the beam because 4 man Fall Mountain is much easier than 13 man Fall Mountain. Apparently you're all too simple to understand strategy, though. It's a Battle Royale and nobody seems to understand what that entails.
Jeez dude you're getting a bit too hostile over a game this casual. Were you the pirate skin I held back?
    > Jeez dude you're getting a bit too hostile over a game this casual

you posted a video of you getting pure revenge on someone in another map after they did a competitively helpful move...where is your ability for self reflection lol
        Lol I'll give you that but I'd argue this guy is a bit more into this game than I am.
    \*Posts video of hostile act in game\*  


\*Calls someone out for being hostile over a few words\*
        Live by the troll die by the troll.  You can't get mad at someone trolling you if you're being a huge asshole first.
        Hostile isn't the right word I'll admit that. How about taking this game way too seriously given the content of the game? Tone it down a bit man you're getting angry over something that's not worth it.
            You must be the 5 year old this game is targeted to. Jeez man. You're acting like a child
Yea that’s my point, so why’s OP salty about it? The pirate caused everyone to lose and OP went and did it too. It’s all in good fun
"fun way"
Completely agree, the aim of the game is to win by any means necessary which the pirate tried to do. OP just threw and ruined the game for himself and someone else
Pardon? 

I didn't contradict my point in any way, because my point is only 'anything's fair game' lol.

It's cute how insanely salty you are anyways. You sure you don't wanna say some more stuff? C'mon, type some more.
    [removed]
        You say that and yet you replied again, nice to see you again. :)

You got me, I do have ADHD actually, pal, would you like to rant on it a bit more? Get it all out there we're here for you.
Yeah man, throwing a match is totally getting justice against someone who was strategically trying to win. Cool.
    Obviously stopping the asshat who played like a douche was more important. He's free to play like a douche, I'm free to be satisfied by being an instrument of karmic justice.
It's a completely meaningless game with no leaderboards and no real incentive to win besides some skins. You want to win? Great. You want to get revenge and ruin someones game? Sounds good to me.
    You want to win this game? You want to try and play the video game for its intended purpose and challenge yourself to some healthy competition with others? cool

You want to throw your game to fuck someone else over completely? You want to spend 90% of your time going out of your way to upset random people just trying to have fun or carry grudges throughout multiple stages to destroy any sense of competition or fun the final round might have had? Also equally as cool and totally valid and not in any way mean or petty.
        It is quite possible that you take video games way too seriously. If you are that traumatized by a jelly bean trying to make you lose a game *for also trying to make him lose a game* then I think maybe you should reevaluate your priorities.

When you make enemies, anything can happen to you.
            I don't see the point in exaggerating my annoyance or being reductive about anti-fun brigades in online games, neither of those help the discussion at all.

I think when you're playing an online game with other people you should have the tiniest amount of consideration. 

I don't think taking pleasure in annoying others is a healthy trait nor should it be encouraged, I don't think throwing your game to ruin someone else's is as valid as simply playing the game as intended and I genuinely believe people have every right to question this kind of spiteful behaviour in an all-ages online game when all it does is get them nowhere and get one random other person really confused and annoyed.

I truly do not see the point in feeding such an unhealthy compulsion when you gain nothing but satisfaction from the idea of upsetting someone and the other player is now 2% more stressed out than they need to be while attempting to enjoy the game.

In real life we heavily discourage that sort of behaviour and we still do despite the anonymity that the internet provides
I wasn't reffering to this video though xd
    that's what I mean, in race rounds pushing and going for elims is fair game as its obviously encouraged, in final modes why literally ruin the whole thing?

One guy gets his free win with basically no effort, one guy has his chance to win removed completely and the last guy is sacrificing his opportunity to win solely to remove the chance of winning from guy 2; the literal only point behind it is petty revenge which is hilarious considering everyone is a number atm and you could easily confuse two identical players for each other and ruin  some poor innocent pirate's game for no reason.
        Oh yeah, I completely agree in that case (not sarcastic)
        Poor innocent pirate, i hope he recovers from this traumatising experience. Shall we make a gofundme page to pay for his therapy sessions?
I don't even agree with his point. You take your future into your own hands when you grief people, even if it's strategic to do so. Especially if you're in a distinguishing outfit.

People hold grudges. And this is coming from someone that works hard at murdering people on certain levels. I also target people who were being grabby on other levels. Sometimes you get killed for it and you just accept it and move on to the next.
You're taking this game and thread way too seriously if it's that taxing on your mental health.
Spends 41 minutes acting like a salty bitch while accusing OP of being a salty bitch. LMFAO.
    everyone here is name-calling and acting like a salty-bitch, myself included, so you don't really have the right to say shit like that as if it isn't the exact way everyone else is behaving over a game
        The only guy acting like a salty bitch is the guy I replied to. Everyone else in this thread is making fun of him. But thanks for incorrecting me lol.
            ah I see, your definition of "salty bitch" doesn't include yourself or people who agree with you despite behaving almost identically to the people you're dog-piling on.

Very convenient
                LMFAO are you actually white-knighting the guy acting like a salty bitch? Congrats, this is a new level of simp I haven't seen yet.
                    it took you a shockingly brief amount of time to call me a Simp lmao

It's literally like wrapping my 'W' in a pretty little box with rhinestones and ribbons and then kissing it and handing it to me in a maid outfit, seriously was there not one single better word you could think of in the English language to call someone over a disagreement relating to a colourful rainbow party game.
                        LMFAO sure keep defending the guy who was so salty his comment got deleted by the mods. I'm sure he appreciates your white-knighting efforts, simp.

And why am I not surprised you're bitching about the OP elsewhere in this thread? LMFAO your sodium levels are as high as the guy you're white-knighting.

Sure, keep pretending you won. The whole thread knows who the real salty bitches are in this thread anyway no matter how much you try to hide behind "I'm not owned, I'm not owned!"
It's a good thing you're going to stop replying because you're the only annoying dickwad here.
Ok.
>  then you're just a salty bitch.


> I'm not going waste any more of my mental health on this.

I hope you can see the irony yourself.
Welcome in reddit, you can't have opinions
    The guy is right in his own way , I mostly find joy when winning , this game is fun but its even more when you win , and sabotaging yourself for the pirate bean not to win is not worth it for me , but the pirate definitely learned a lesson for his unfair plays
        unfair? why do you think they put grabbing in the game?

Not for people to kamikaze and throw their game to ruin someone else's too, but as one extra tool at your disposal to add some kind of strategy and contest to the game. 

I'd say grabbing is one of the least unfair things as everyone can do it but can be easily countered by jumping and diving as well as basic human nature dictating that 99% of players aren't just going to grab you for no reason and put themselves behind.
            What he did wasnt grabbing , he was standing in the middle of the way on those yellow bridges , maybe it doesnt seem fair to you but implicitly its not something that needs to be encouraged
                I simply jump and dive over them, 80% success rate
                    Can you ? Its hard to find balance when walking on these poles , cant imagine how it is diving over , for sure you would fall off no ?
                        Sometimes I do but diving is the same as walking on those; if you do it in a straight line you shouldn't lose balance
        i don't understand why people think what the pirate is doing is unfair. falling to someone blocking the pole like that is pretty nooby, you can either push them off the pole or just jump and dive over them.

if i were OP i would have just dived over the head of the pirate at the end of the course and killed him there.

the guy who called him a salty bitch was being pretty rude about it but i mostly agree with him. i would rather try to kill the guy who bullied me or one-up him by winning the crown himself. i don't see the satisfaction in griefing that guy and yourself for petty revenge.
            I agree totally thats not a way to get revenge since you are jeoparding your chances of winning , but Slime Climb is hard and stressful enough that blocking the pole to access the next floor is maybe not unfair but its totally not fair , Lose Lose situation for both players
I've got enough wins to keep me happy. Sounds like you're taking this game too seriously.
    says the guy who took enough offense to a beam patroller to sabotage his own finals lol
        Lol I stand by what I did. He had to learn his lesson the hard way.
    Nah I just find this sort of idea of "revenge" where you're only costing your own win petty and childish. I'd have forgotten about the guy within seconds.
        I can't believe there's already elitists like you in this game. I'm just here sharing the fun I'm having and you immediately shit on it.
            not holding a grudge and not going out of your way to spite them isn't elitism lmao
            Already said I'm glad you're having fun without getting wins. I wasn't being sarcastic.

The way I have fun in this game is by winning. If I had done the exact thing you did in the video I would not have felt good about it at all because I clearly would have cost my win.
                And as we all know, winning is the only thing that matters.
                    i mean in the finals, yes... it is.
                    winning because you had a better run than everyone else in the lobby feels good. you also get rewarded. 

in my opinion the way to get revenge on the pirate that would actually feel satisfying would be by beating him. maybe if you want to be petty grab him before he can grab the crown and take it. but i agree with the guy you're replying to, just sacrificing your ability to win on the final round because someone was playing smart earlier just feels like petty revenge. you didn't outplay him, you didn't deny him the crown and show him he lost because he didn't kill you before. if the third bean was your friend and you were just gifting him a win that would be different though.
                If you think only winning is fun then you should just hack the game, and have all the fun collecting crowns without any effort :)

                        I love how you claim him to be childish in a child’s games. Like wtf. That’s like a acussing someone for being a fucking adult when doing taxes.
No cause this was way more satisfying to me. Besides, why go for something you MIGHT have a shot at when you could go for something guaranteed like dragging this bean down with me? I already had enough wins to keep me happy anyways.
    Because its dumb.   Theres going to be beam patrollers in literally every game pretty soon.  Have fun never winning again and "teaching everyone a lesson" lol.
        I literally won 3 games after this. What you find dumb I find fun and that's okay. I saw my shot and took it and this'll probably never happen again so I'm happy.
        You're really missing the writing on the wall
What goes around comes around? You can feel free to block people's progress in this game (it is a Battle Royale) you just have to be prepared for any consequences that may come your way.
Is this a reference I don't understand or are you just some comedic genius?
    There's a video of Tony Hawk criticising skating in movies and Spiderman 3 featured. He wasn't impressed with the fake skating. I had recently watched it.
YES.

Mad
People don't believe being gay black or trans makes you more interesting. Its just representation in media for groups who haven't had much at all outside of joke side characters and grave fillers.
What? This has nothing to do with feminists lmao

It’s just a joke about Netflix writers
Come on man you know the Furries made him do it, SMHmy head
Good man. Stay safe.
It’s says it during the loading screen AND reminds you at the top of your screen in game to grab the crown using R2
It means you can't dive for the crown (since you can't grab while diving), so it does slightly change the game.
    I made a dive for it my first and, to this day, only time making it up there before anyone else, and I bonked my head.

Just realized why I didn't win then.
        I dived too! RIP
    The dive wouldn't always be the best option anyway since it lowers your character's collision box, and thus would prevent you from touching the crown if it's a bit too high, whereas a normal jump would reach it.

Removing the need to grab would add the need to decide whether you dive or jump, and also would fix all the bugs related to grabbing the crown (there are a lot). IMO it's a win-win. It's an arbitrary requirement that only steals wins from new players anyway.
    I’ve head butted the crown twice now I never knew you couldn’t dive and grab
    Wait what? That explains all the fall mountain losses I’ve had lol
Idk it feels pretty logical. Bean that gets his hands to the final object first wins. If getting to the top would be the only thing that matters it would just be a finish line.
I think they did it for publicity. It's funny to watch someone go for their first win, and not realize they need to grab.
Wasn't there a patch for that physics bug?
    Idk
The problem is one team is always uneven and gets fucked because of it

That's...every game ever though, right?
    No? Not the solo games, or games where you can choose your team.
There are obviously multiple levels of griefing and some are more ok than others, don't know what's so hard to understand. Griefing doesn't have to necessarily be a bad thing and can be fun.

Giving up your chances of winning because you want to target grief someone is so much worse than pushing random people because you want to eliminate them.
    Fair enough.  However, those who seek to purposely eliminate others can't possible expect that those other players will not be upset and seek revenge.
        That's true, you will make other players angry and angry people aren't usually very rational.

I just think behavior like in this clip shouldn't be glorified, you are not some saint who killed evil, you got mad and did something stupid. Someone pushed you? Push him back, don't try to completly destroy him no matter the costs.
I am not exactly sure how it works, but aren't spawns based on previous rounds?
    No they’re random
Griefing doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing. 

Pushing random people with intended mechanic is good griefing, it's just a bit of fun. Some levels would be very boring without griefing, Roll Out for example.

Giving up your chances of winning because you want to completly destroy 1 person is bad and toxic.
    The issue here is that you're drawing the line between what is griefing to you and what isn't and that's an arguable line and most people don't see it as such.

You cannot simply say, "well, this griefing is okay and this one isn't" because griefing is griefing. 

Also, who's to say that the person gave up his chances? For the majority of the race, he was straight behind him for a potential chance to win if the hammers or balls hit Pirate any harder.

As you said, "it's just a bit of fun". If you're going to grief, you have zero right to complain about getting griefed back, regardless of whether or not its final game.
        No, the issue is you are not capable of thinking about griefing as something not horrible.

If you are still trying to win I don't care what you do, that's it. I am not trying to set some hypothetical line between good griefing and bad griefing, it's extremly simple. If you make it your life mission to destroy someone because he pushed you once, you are dumb. If everyone stopped griefing, this game would be boring. Some levels like Roll out wouldn't be nearly as fun as they are now.


And please don't even try to argue player in this clip was trying to win, he very obviously wasn't, he literally waited for that pirate every time he was ahead of him.
            > No, the issue is you are not capable of thinking about griefing as something not horrible.

No, I never implied that. The logic is that if you grief someone, expect to be griefed back. It's that simple. It seems you're the one that isn't capable of grasping that.

This has no merit on whether or not its strategic or causing yourself the loss.
                Again, you completly ignore my point. You can't just say griefing Is griefing, it doesn't work like that, just because it's called griefing doesn't mean it's the same thing.

I wouldn't expect you to steal my phone because i stole your chicken wing. I would expect you to steal my chicken nugget. You are basically saying I should expect you to steal everything because i stole from you and it's fine because stealing is stealing.

It's the same with griefing, I would expect you to try to push me after I pushed you, I wouldnt expect to make an enemy for life because i pushed you. 

Of course it's not forbbiden, people can do that, but it's very unreasonable toxic behavior and shouldn't be glorified like people do in this post.
                    > I wouldn't expect you to steal my phone because i stole your chicken wing. I would expect you to steal my chicken nugget. 

Well, that's where you're wrong. You shouldn't expect someone to do you wrong at the same level because you did them wrong.

That's like saying I shouldn't expect you to steal -anything- from me, and you did, so therefore, don't expect me to steal whatever equivalent you have because -you- cause the neutrality to tip in the first place. That logic is linear to the overall toxicity.
You forgot the /s

I always target the asshat and I've seen a few more people do the same.  The community is allowed to retaliate in any way they see fit.  You want to grief?  I want to make Fall Guys a place of peace and harmony.
    We all want a positive gaming community and that is what we're steering towards but the grab function exists to mess around with others. It's a core gameplay mechanic. I can't stop anyone from being a dickhead and petty towards someone who uses this mechanic but it shouldn't be praised.

EDIT: Thanks for the downvotes guys. Very constructive.
ChainChump said

> Using game mechanics to help win an individual game isn't toxic lol. 

Eliminating people doesn't help you win the individual game of Slime Climb. You can win Slime Climb by focusing on yourself.   


It is a valid strategy for thinning the herd but it doesn't guarantee your victory.
    People want to act like there's no social aspect to this game, but that's impossible for any game where humans interact. If you want to focus on ensuring failure in others in order to increase your odds, that is an acceptable strategy. It's not morally wrong or anything. But you're gonna want to enter revenge into your calculus of how the game is gonna go.
        Live by the grab, die by the grab.
It's a valid strategy. Doesn't mean I don't love to see them get taken out the same way they took out others or myself.
    Live by the sword die by the sword
        Live by the yeet, die by the yeet.
I don't get mad. I get even.
Wouldn’t the pirates attempt to block everyone from winning be the actual MLG move? Everyone else just wants to actually play the game.
    The dude stopped for a few seconds. Relax. You guys are calling him a toxic gamer like he's spewing racist threats and aimbotting. I can't believe how bent out of shape you're all being over this.
    Dude it’s a game where you play as a bean and run obstacles. They added grab as a fun mechanic. The point of the game is to have fun.
        Some of us don’t have a lot of time to play. If I can only afford an hour of game time a day I want to spend it actually playing the game.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
I just think it's funny that people get so bent out of shape over a game mechanic. Yeah I get why you dont like it it's not exactly fun to be on the receiving end of a grab that eliminates you but for some people it's part of the fun.  People are so desperate to have their cake and eat it too. By this subs definition of toxic, targeting the losing team in Egg Scramble is probably toxic as well but I never see anyone play any other way. Its just a silly game get over it.
    100 percent on board. It’s supposed to be a silly, fun game. Plus you get sweet karma vids lol. I guarantee that the person who was who grabbing in the OP post wasn’t upset they lost lol.
Yes! I will be in stitches from trying to fuck some one over and end up sending myself into oblivion. And then i get right back into another game a minute later. 

There are a lot of babies on this thread through. I'm definitely going to be grabbing players more often. 

Its a party game, with a grab mechanic, which is fun. Stop trying to make everything a PVE game. A little pvp makes everything better.
    My biggest attitude shift has been in the game Roll Out. I used to just mind my business and go back and forth. It would be very rare if I didn't qualify but now I run around like an ass trying to shove people off. This has probably doubled my chances of being eliminated but it's now chaotic fun and a course I enjoy rather than it being a chore.
        It also has doubled your fun i bet. The games people just run back and forth and try not to fall off the platform is too many. The grabbing on that stage adds a ton of fun.
            Yep, I usually go dizzy trying to adjust the camera though. That's usually how I fall through.
He absolutely did and I have no problem with it.  I just find it annoying when I’m on the receiving end and if you play like that you can’t be surprised when someone sabotages your win.
>It does if you take away the fun from other people. In general, it's not fun when you are immobilized, in any fashion, whether by gameplay mechanic or other player. You are free to do it but you should also accept the consequences of those actions.

Nonetheless it's part of the game though. If you weren't meant to be able to grab/block people it wouldn't be there? I think people are ready to accept the consequences, because you can easily get punished for doing any of these things. But I think throwing is a step too far.

&#x200B;

>Also, I'd say the pirate is exploiting a design flaw in the level. It's the only place in the whole game where one person can bottleneck a level from everyone else. There really isn't a good way around it and the situation is very unbalanced towards the player camping that spot.

It's not that hard to get around it though. I'd say the flaw is in the start more so than that part, because at least if it was skill alone that got you there first that'd be better. But the developers haven't really said anything against this part, and even embraced the memes.
    Sure, it's part of the game, but that doesn't necessarily means it's a good thing. If a large number of people don't enjoy it then, maybe it is worth taking another look at it. I'd say one way to make it more balanced is if the players pop apart, the grabbing player is the one that is moved back. A small change that would make it less of a griefing tactic.

It's not easy to punish if you are eliminated as the result of the action. Or you get stuck in a stalemate where you are both grabbing each other while everyone else runs on by. Plus many cases of counteracting usually results in the player sacrificing themselves.

For slime climb in particular, it's unbalanced to have one player have so much of an effect on everyone else. A simple solution is to have it go from 3 beams to 2, instead of 2 to 1.

And just because the devs haven't said anything doesn't mean that they don't acknowledge it or that if they don't acknowledge it, that it's not a problem.
        >Sure, it's part of the game, but that doesn't necessarily means it's a good thing. If a large number of people don't enjoy it then, maybe it is worth taking another look at it.

That's fair, but I'd personally be disappointed if they did that. Imagine the game with no collisions, no grabbing.. sounds pretty boring to me.

&#x200B;

>I'd say one way to make it more balanced is if the players pop apart, the grabbing player is the one that is moved back. A small change that would make it less of a griefing tactic.

I'm getting the impression that you're not a fan of people trying to knock anyone out at all? People being pushed back by grabbing is one of the main ways to knock someone out. It's not "griefing" if it's part of the game. I mean you're meant to knock people out, whether you do that by completing the course quickly or otherwise, so I don't get how it's griefing.

&#x200B;

>It's not easy to punish if you are eliminated as the result of the action. Or you get stuck in a stalemate where you are both grabbing each other while everyone else runs on by. Plus many cases of counteracting usually results in the player sacrificing themselves.

Why would you be able to punish someone that eliminates you? If you got eliminated you got outplayed, that's all there is to it. If you're both stuck and both fail intentionally then I guess that's a throw and bad? If you hold someone back and still try to survive I don't think there's anything wrong with that. If you try to counteract a grab and sacrifice yourself then you've been outplayed.

&#x200B;

>For slime climb in particular, it's unbalanced to have one player have so much of an effect on everyone else. A simple solution is to have it go from 3 beams to 2, instead of 2 to 1.

Again I don't think it's that hard to get around it but I'd be open to that idea. You only need someone else to do it alongside you though.
            I never said no collisions or grabbing. But I think grabbing has too much of a low risk/high reward. That's why making you the one that pops back if you grab evens it out. Note that you can also just walk into people to push them. It's about balance. And just because you came out on top doesn't mean you outplayed someone. Of all games, this game should teach you that.

Ultimately, it's about fun and I don't agree that winning = fun. Some of the most boring game types are the ones that I never get eliminated from (like perfect match or the one with the rotating cylinders). A lot of the un-funness in this game revolves around not running around so being locked in someone's grip is not really something I find enjoyable.

And as for me personally, it's not an issue as I'm rarely in these situations but as far as game mechanics go, there is room for a bit of fine tuning.
            You're right about everything but that bottleneck in slime climb shouldn't be there.
No, the point is winning the match. Eliminating 10 people and still qualifying is really easy and efficient.

        griefing in this game is almost always not worth it hahahaha

every time anyone griefs they become the target in the lobby. there was once a toucan griefing at that exact spot in slime climb and everyone in the lobby made it their life mission to ensure that toucan. i ended up with the dub because i didn’t get involved!
        So in egg scramble you don’t target the team with the least amount of eggs? Sounds like using your advantage to screw other people to me.

There's nothing shitty about strategically eliminating enough people to skip straight to the final round, and improve your odds of winning. I know I've personally gotten crowns from knocking people off the beam because 4 man Fall Mountain is much easier than 13 man Fall Mountain. Apparently you're all too simple to understand strategy, though. It's a Battle Royale and nobody seems to understand what that entails.
> Jeez dude you're getting a bit too hostile over a game this casual

you posted a video of you getting pure revenge on someone in another map after they did a competitively helpful move...where is your ability for self reflection lol
    Lol I'll give you that but I'd argue this guy is a bit more into this game than I am.
\*Posts video of hostile act in game\*  


\*Calls someone out for being hostile over a few words\*
    Live by the troll die by the troll.  You can't get mad at someone trolling you if you're being a huge asshole first.
    Hostile isn't the right word I'll admit that. How about taking this game way too seriously given the content of the game? Tone it down a bit man you're getting angry over something that's not worth it.
        You must be the 5 year old this game is targeted to. Jeez man. You're acting like a child

    You say that and yet you replied again, nice to see you again. :)

You got me, I do have ADHD actually, pal, would you like to rant on it a bit more? Get it all out there we're here for you.
Obviously stopping the asshat who played like a douche was more important. He's free to play like a douche, I'm free to be satisfied by being an instrument of karmic justice.
You want to win this game? You want to try and play the video game for its intended purpose and challenge yourself to some healthy competition with others? cool

You want to throw your game to fuck someone else over completely? You want to spend 90% of your time going out of your way to upset random people just trying to have fun or carry grudges throughout multiple stages to destroy any sense of competition or fun the final round might have had? Also equally as cool and totally valid and not in any way mean or petty.
    It is quite possible that you take video games way too seriously. If you are that traumatized by a jelly bean trying to make you lose a game *for also trying to make him lose a game* then I think maybe you should reevaluate your priorities.

When you make enemies, anything can happen to you.
        I don't see the point in exaggerating my annoyance or being reductive about anti-fun brigades in online games, neither of those help the discussion at all.

I think when you're playing an online game with other people you should have the tiniest amount of consideration. 

I don't think taking pleasure in annoying others is a healthy trait nor should it be encouraged, I don't think throwing your game to ruin someone else's is as valid as simply playing the game as intended and I genuinely believe people have every right to question this kind of spiteful behaviour in an all-ages online game when all it does is get them nowhere and get one random other person really confused and annoyed.

I truly do not see the point in feeding such an unhealthy compulsion when you gain nothing but satisfaction from the idea of upsetting someone and the other player is now 2% more stressed out than they need to be while attempting to enjoy the game.

In real life we heavily discourage that sort of behaviour and we still do despite the anonymity that the internet provides
that's what I mean, in race rounds pushing and going for elims is fair game as its obviously encouraged, in final modes why literally ruin the whole thing?

One guy gets his free win with basically no effort, one guy has his chance to win removed completely and the last guy is sacrificing his opportunity to win solely to remove the chance of winning from guy 2; the literal only point behind it is petty revenge which is hilarious considering everyone is a number atm and you could easily confuse two identical players for each other and ruin  some poor innocent pirate's game for no reason.
    Oh yeah, I completely agree in that case (not sarcastic)
    Poor innocent pirate, i hope he recovers from this traumatising experience. Shall we make a gofundme page to pay for his therapy sessions?
everyone here is name-calling and acting like a salty-bitch, myself included, so you don't really have the right to say shit like that as if it isn't the exact way everyone else is behaving over a game
    The only guy acting like a salty bitch is the guy I replied to. Everyone else in this thread is making fun of him. But thanks for incorrecting me lol.
        ah I see, your definition of "salty bitch" doesn't include yourself or people who agree with you despite behaving almost identically to the people you're dog-piling on.

Very convenient
            LMFAO are you actually white-knighting the guy acting like a salty bitch? Congrats, this is a new level of simp I haven't seen yet.
                it took you a shockingly brief amount of time to call me a Simp lmao

It's literally like wrapping my 'W' in a pretty little box with rhinestones and ribbons and then kissing it and handing it to me in a maid outfit, seriously was there not one single better word you could think of in the English language to call someone over a disagreement relating to a colourful rainbow party game.
                    LMFAO sure keep defending the guy who was so salty his comment got deleted by the mods. I'm sure he appreciates your white-knighting efforts, simp.

And why am I not surprised you're bitching about the OP elsewhere in this thread? LMFAO your sodium levels are as high as the guy you're white-knighting.

Sure, keep pretending you won. The whole thread knows who the real salty bitches are in this thread anyway no matter how much you try to hide behind "I'm not owned, I'm not owned!"
The guy is right in his own way , I mostly find joy when winning , this game is fun but its even more when you win , and sabotaging yourself for the pirate bean not to win is not worth it for me , but the pirate definitely learned a lesson for his unfair plays
    unfair? why do you think they put grabbing in the game?

Not for people to kamikaze and throw their game to ruin someone else's too, but as one extra tool at your disposal to add some kind of strategy and contest to the game. 

I'd say grabbing is one of the least unfair things as everyone can do it but can be easily countered by jumping and diving as well as basic human nature dictating that 99% of players aren't just going to grab you for no reason and put themselves behind.
        What he did wasnt grabbing , he was standing in the middle of the way on those yellow bridges , maybe it doesnt seem fair to you but implicitly its not something that needs to be encouraged
            I simply jump and dive over them, 80% success rate
                Can you ? Its hard to find balance when walking on these poles , cant imagine how it is diving over , for sure you would fall off no ?
                    Sometimes I do but diving is the same as walking on those; if you do it in a straight line you shouldn't lose balance
    i don't understand why people think what the pirate is doing is unfair. falling to someone blocking the pole like that is pretty nooby, you can either push them off the pole or just jump and dive over them.

if i were OP i would have just dived over the head of the pirate at the end of the course and killed him there.

the guy who called him a salty bitch was being pretty rude about it but i mostly agree with him. i would rather try to kill the guy who bullied me or one-up him by winning the crown himself. i don't see the satisfaction in griefing that guy and yourself for petty revenge.
        I agree totally thats not a way to get revenge since you are jeoparding your chances of winning , but Slime Climb is hard and stressful enough that blocking the pole to access the next floor is maybe not unfair but its totally not fair , Lose Lose situation for both players
says the guy who took enough offense to a beam patroller to sabotage his own finals lol
    Lol I stand by what I did. He had to learn his lesson the hard way.
Nah I just find this sort of idea of "revenge" where you're only costing your own win petty and childish. I'd have forgotten about the guy within seconds.
    I can't believe there's already elitists like you in this game. I'm just here sharing the fun I'm having and you immediately shit on it.
        not holding a grudge and not going out of your way to spite them isn't elitism lmao
        Already said I'm glad you're having fun without getting wins. I wasn't being sarcastic.

The way I have fun in this game is by winning. If I had done the exact thing you did in the video I would not have felt good about it at all because I clearly would have cost my win.
            And as we all know, winning is the only thing that matters.
                i mean in the finals, yes... it is.
                winning because you had a better run than everyone else in the lobby feels good. you also get rewarded. 

in my opinion the way to get revenge on the pirate that would actually feel satisfying would be by beating him. maybe if you want to be petty grab him before he can grab the crown and take it. but i agree with the guy you're replying to, just sacrificing your ability to win on the final round because someone was playing smart earlier just feels like petty revenge. you didn't outplay him, you didn't deny him the crown and show him he lost because he didn't kill you before. if the third bean was your friend and you were just gifting him a win that would be different though.
            If you think only winning is fun then you should just hack the game, and have all the fun collecting crowns without any effort :)

Because its dumb.   Theres going to be beam patrollers in literally every game pretty soon.  Have fun never winning again and "teaching everyone a lesson" lol.

No? Not the solo games, or games where you can choose your team.
Fair enough.  However, those who seek to purposely eliminate others can't possible expect that those other players will not be upset and seek revenge.
    That's true, you will make other players angry and angry people aren't usually very rational.

I just think behavior like in this clip shouldn't be glorified, you are not some saint who killed evil, you got mad and did something stupid. Someone pushed you? Push him back, don't try to completly destroy him no matter the costs.
No they’re random
The issue here is that you're drawing the line between what is griefing to you and what isn't and that's an arguable line and most people don't see it as such.

You cannot simply say, "well, this griefing is okay and this one isn't" because griefing is griefing. 

Also, who's to say that the person gave up his chances? For the majority of the race, he was straight behind him for a potential chance to win if the hammers or balls hit Pirate any harder.

As you said, "it's just a bit of fun". If you're going to grief, you have zero right to complain about getting griefed back, regardless of whether or not its final game.
    No, the issue is you are not capable of thinking about griefing as something not horrible.

If you are still trying to win I don't care what you do, that's it. I am not trying to set some hypothetical line between good griefing and bad griefing, it's extremly simple. If you make it your life mission to destroy someone because he pushed you once, you are dumb. If everyone stopped griefing, this game would be boring. Some levels like Roll out wouldn't be nearly as fun as they are now.


And please don't even try to argue player in this clip was trying to win, he very obviously wasn't, he literally waited for that pirate every time he was ahead of him.
        > No, the issue is you are not capable of thinking about griefing as something not horrible.

No, I never implied that. The logic is that if you grief someone, expect to be griefed back. It's that simple. It seems you're the one that isn't capable of grasping that.

This has no merit on whether or not its strategic or causing yourself the loss.
            Again, you completly ignore my point. You can't just say griefing Is griefing, it doesn't work like that, just because it's called griefing doesn't mean it's the same thing.

I wouldn't expect you to steal my phone because i stole your chicken wing. I would expect you to steal my chicken nugget. You are basically saying I should expect you to steal everything because i stole from you and it's fine because stealing is stealing.

It's the same with griefing, I would expect you to try to push me after I pushed you, I wouldnt expect to make an enemy for life because i pushed you. 

Of course it's not forbbiden, people can do that, but it's very unreasonable toxic behavior and shouldn't be glorified like people do in this post.
                > I wouldn't expect you to steal my phone because i stole your chicken wing. I would expect you to steal my chicken nugget. 

Well, that's where you're wrong. You shouldn't expect someone to do you wrong at the same level because you did them wrong.

That's like saying I shouldn't expect you to steal -anything- from me, and you did, so therefore, don't expect me to steal whatever equivalent you have because -you- cause the neutrality to tip in the first place. That logic is linear to the overall toxicity.
We all want a positive gaming community and that is what we're steering towards but the grab function exists to mess around with others. It's a core gameplay mechanic. I can't stop anyone from being a dickhead and petty towards someone who uses this mechanic but it shouldn't be praised.

EDIT: Thanks for the downvotes guys. Very constructive.
People want to act like there's no social aspect to this game, but that's impossible for any game where humans interact. If you want to focus on ensuring failure in others in order to increase your odds, that is an acceptable strategy. It's not morally wrong or anything. But you're gonna want to enter revenge into your calculus of how the game is gonna go.
    Live by the grab, die by the grab.
Live by the sword die by the sword
    Live by the yeet, die by the yeet.
The dude stopped for a few seconds. Relax. You guys are calling him a toxic gamer like he's spewing racist threats and aimbotting. I can't believe how bent out of shape you're all being over this.
Dude it’s a game where you play as a bean and run obstacles. They added grab as a fun mechanic. The point of the game is to have fun.
    Some of us don’t have a lot of time to play. If I can only afford an hour of game time a day I want to spend it actually playing the game.
100 percent on board. It’s supposed to be a silly, fun game. Plus you get sweet karma vids lol. I guarantee that the person who was who grabbing in the OP post wasn’t upset they lost lol.
My biggest attitude shift has been in the game Roll Out. I used to just mind my business and go back and forth. It would be very rare if I didn't qualify but now I run around like an ass trying to shove people off. This has probably doubled my chances of being eliminated but it's now chaotic fun and a course I enjoy rather than it being a chore.
    It also has doubled your fun i bet. The games people just run back and forth and try not to fall off the platform is too many. The grabbing on that stage adds a ton of fun.
        Yep, I usually go dizzy trying to adjust the camera though. That's usually how I fall through.
Sure, it's part of the game, but that doesn't necessarily means it's a good thing. If a large number of people don't enjoy it then, maybe it is worth taking another look at it. I'd say one way to make it more balanced is if the players pop apart, the grabbing player is the one that is moved back. A small change that would make it less of a griefing tactic.

It's not easy to punish if you are eliminated as the result of the action. Or you get stuck in a stalemate where you are both grabbing each other while everyone else runs on by. Plus many cases of counteracting usually results in the player sacrificing themselves.

For slime climb in particular, it's unbalanced to have one player have so much of an effect on everyone else. A simple solution is to have it go from 3 beams to 2, instead of 2 to 1.

And just because the devs haven't said anything doesn't mean that they don't acknowledge it or that if they don't acknowledge it, that it's not a problem.
    >Sure, it's part of the game, but that doesn't necessarily means it's a good thing. If a large number of people don't enjoy it then, maybe it is worth taking another look at it.

That's fair, but I'd personally be disappointed if they did that. Imagine the game with no collisions, no grabbing.. sounds pretty boring to me.

&#x200B;

>I'd say one way to make it more balanced is if the players pop apart, the grabbing player is the one that is moved back. A small change that would make it less of a griefing tactic.

I'm getting the impression that you're not a fan of people trying to knock anyone out at all? People being pushed back by grabbing is one of the main ways to knock someone out. It's not "griefing" if it's part of the game. I mean you're meant to knock people out, whether you do that by completing the course quickly or otherwise, so I don't get how it's griefing.

&#x200B;

>It's not easy to punish if you are eliminated as the result of the action. Or you get stuck in a stalemate where you are both grabbing each other while everyone else runs on by. Plus many cases of counteracting usually results in the player sacrificing themselves.

Why would you be able to punish someone that eliminates you? If you got eliminated you got outplayed, that's all there is to it. If you're both stuck and both fail intentionally then I guess that's a throw and bad? If you hold someone back and still try to survive I don't think there's anything wrong with that. If you try to counteract a grab and sacrifice yourself then you've been outplayed.

&#x200B;

>For slime climb in particular, it's unbalanced to have one player have so much of an effect on everyone else. A simple solution is to have it go from 3 beams to 2, instead of 2 to 1.

Again I don't think it's that hard to get around it but I'd be open to that idea. You only need someone else to do it alongside you though.
        I never said no collisions or grabbing. But I think grabbing has too much of a low risk/high reward. That's why making you the one that pops back if you grab evens it out. Note that you can also just walk into people to push them. It's about balance. And just because you came out on top doesn't mean you outplayed someone. Of all games, this game should teach you that.

Ultimately, it's about fun and I don't agree that winning = fun. Some of the most boring game types are the ones that I never get eliminated from (like perfect match or the one with the rotating cylinders). A lot of the un-funness in this game revolves around not running around so being locked in someone's grip is not really something I find enjoyable.

And as for me personally, it's not an issue as I'm rarely in these situations but as far as game mechanics go, there is room for a bit of fine tuning.
        You're right about everything but that bottleneck in slime climb shouldn't be there.

    griefing in this game is almost always not worth it hahahaha

every time anyone griefs they become the target in the lobby. there was once a toucan griefing at that exact spot in slime climb and everyone in the lobby made it their life mission to ensure that toucan. i ended up with the dub because i didn’t get involved!
    So in egg scramble you don’t target the team with the least amount of eggs? Sounds like using your advantage to screw other people to me.

Lol I'll give you that but I'd argue this guy is a bit more into this game than I am.
Live by the troll die by the troll.  You can't get mad at someone trolling you if you're being a huge asshole first.
Hostile isn't the right word I'll admit that. How about taking this game way too seriously given the content of the game? Tone it down a bit man you're getting angry over something that's not worth it.
    You must be the 5 year old this game is targeted to. Jeez man. You're acting like a child
You say that and yet you replied again, nice to see you again. :)

You got me, I do have ADHD actually, pal, would you like to rant on it a bit more? Get it all out there we're here for you.
It is quite possible that you take video games way too seriously. If you are that traumatized by a jelly bean trying to make you lose a game *for also trying to make him lose a game* then I think maybe you should reevaluate your priorities.

When you make enemies, anything can happen to you.
    I don't see the point in exaggerating my annoyance or being reductive about anti-fun brigades in online games, neither of those help the discussion at all.

I think when you're playing an online game with other people you should have the tiniest amount of consideration. 

I don't think taking pleasure in annoying others is a healthy trait nor should it be encouraged, I don't think throwing your game to ruin someone else's is as valid as simply playing the game as intended and I genuinely believe people have every right to question this kind of spiteful behaviour in an all-ages online game when all it does is get them nowhere and get one random other person really confused and annoyed.

I truly do not see the point in feeding such an unhealthy compulsion when you gain nothing but satisfaction from the idea of upsetting someone and the other player is now 2% more stressed out than they need to be while attempting to enjoy the game.

In real life we heavily discourage that sort of behaviour and we still do despite the anonymity that the internet provides
Oh yeah, I completely agree in that case (not sarcastic)
Poor innocent pirate, i hope he recovers from this traumatising experience. Shall we make a gofundme page to pay for his therapy sessions?
The only guy acting like a salty bitch is the guy I replied to. Everyone else in this thread is making fun of him. But thanks for incorrecting me lol.
    ah I see, your definition of "salty bitch" doesn't include yourself or people who agree with you despite behaving almost identically to the people you're dog-piling on.

Very convenient
        LMFAO are you actually white-knighting the guy acting like a salty bitch? Congrats, this is a new level of simp I haven't seen yet.
            it took you a shockingly brief amount of time to call me a Simp lmao

It's literally like wrapping my 'W' in a pretty little box with rhinestones and ribbons and then kissing it and handing it to me in a maid outfit, seriously was there not one single better word you could think of in the English language to call someone over a disagreement relating to a colourful rainbow party game.
                LMFAO sure keep defending the guy who was so salty his comment got deleted by the mods. I'm sure he appreciates your white-knighting efforts, simp.

And why am I not surprised you're bitching about the OP elsewhere in this thread? LMFAO your sodium levels are as high as the guy you're white-knighting.

Sure, keep pretending you won. The whole thread knows who the real salty bitches are in this thread anyway no matter how much you try to hide behind "I'm not owned, I'm not owned!"
unfair? why do you think they put grabbing in the game?

Not for people to kamikaze and throw their game to ruin someone else's too, but as one extra tool at your disposal to add some kind of strategy and contest to the game. 

I'd say grabbing is one of the least unfair things as everyone can do it but can be easily countered by jumping and diving as well as basic human nature dictating that 99% of players aren't just going to grab you for no reason and put themselves behind.
    What he did wasnt grabbing , he was standing in the middle of the way on those yellow bridges , maybe it doesnt seem fair to you but implicitly its not something that needs to be encouraged
        I simply jump and dive over them, 80% success rate
            Can you ? Its hard to find balance when walking on these poles , cant imagine how it is diving over , for sure you would fall off no ?
                Sometimes I do but diving is the same as walking on those; if you do it in a straight line you shouldn't lose balance
i don't understand why people think what the pirate is doing is unfair. falling to someone blocking the pole like that is pretty nooby, you can either push them off the pole or just jump and dive over them.

if i were OP i would have just dived over the head of the pirate at the end of the course and killed him there.

the guy who called him a salty bitch was being pretty rude about it but i mostly agree with him. i would rather try to kill the guy who bullied me or one-up him by winning the crown himself. i don't see the satisfaction in griefing that guy and yourself for petty revenge.
    I agree totally thats not a way to get revenge since you are jeoparding your chances of winning , but Slime Climb is hard and stressful enough that blocking the pole to access the next floor is maybe not unfair but its totally not fair , Lose Lose situation for both players
Lol I stand by what I did. He had to learn his lesson the hard way.
I can't believe there's already elitists like you in this game. I'm just here sharing the fun I'm having and you immediately shit on it.
    not holding a grudge and not going out of your way to spite them isn't elitism lmao
    Already said I'm glad you're having fun without getting wins. I wasn't being sarcastic.

The way I have fun in this game is by winning. If I had done the exact thing you did in the video I would not have felt good about it at all because I clearly would have cost my win.
        And as we all know, winning is the only thing that matters.
            i mean in the finals, yes... it is.
            winning because you had a better run than everyone else in the lobby feels good. you also get rewarded. 

in my opinion the way to get revenge on the pirate that would actually feel satisfying would be by beating him. maybe if you want to be petty grab him before he can grab the crown and take it. but i agree with the guy you're replying to, just sacrificing your ability to win on the final round because someone was playing smart earlier just feels like petty revenge. you didn't outplay him, you didn't deny him the crown and show him he lost because he didn't kill you before. if the third bean was your friend and you were just gifting him a win that would be different though.
        If you think only winning is fun then you should just hack the game, and have all the fun collecting crowns without any effort :)

That's true, you will make other players angry and angry people aren't usually very rational.

I just think behavior like in this clip shouldn't be glorified, you are not some saint who killed evil, you got mad and did something stupid. Someone pushed you? Push him back, don't try to completly destroy him no matter the costs.
No, the issue is you are not capable of thinking about griefing as something not horrible.

    it took you a shockingly brief amount of time to call me a Simp lmao

It's literally like wrapping my 'W' in a pretty little box with rhinestones and ribbons and then kissing it and handing it to me in a maid outfit, seriously was there not one single better word you could think of in the English language to call someone over a disagreement relating to a colourful rainbow party game.
        LMFAO sure keep defending the guy who was so salty his comment got deleted by the mods. I'm sure he appreciates your white-knighting efforts, simp.

And why am I not surprised you're bitching about the OP elsewhere in this thread? LMFAO your sodium levels are as high as the guy you're white-knighting.

Sure, keep pretending you won. The whole thread knows who the real salty bitches are in this thread anyway no matter how much you try to hide behind "I'm not owned, I'm not owned!"
I simply jump and dive over them, 80% success rate
    Can you ? Its hard to find balance when walking on these poles , cant imagine how it is diving over , for sure you would fall off no ?
        Sometimes I do but diving is the same as walking on those; if you do it in a straight line you shouldn't lose balance
And as we all know, winning is the only thing that matters.
    i mean in the finals, yes... it is.
    winning because you had a better run than everyone else in the lobby feels good. you also get rewarded. 

in my opinion the way to get revenge on the pirate that would actually feel satisfying would be by beating him. maybe if you want to be petty grab him before he can grab the crown and take it. but i agree with the guy you're replying to, just sacrificing your ability to win on the final round because someone was playing smart earlier just feels like petty revenge. you didn't outplay him, you didn't deny him the crown and show him he lost because he didn't kill you before. if the third bean was your friend and you were just gifting him a win that would be different though.
If you think only winning is fun then you should just hack the game, and have all the fun collecting crowns without any effort :)

        I love how you claim him to be childish in a child’s games. Like wtf. That’s like a acussing someone for being a fucking adult when doing taxes.
Cause you don’t deserve it friend
    how can i make myself deserve it
Again, you completly ignore my point. You can't just say griefing Is griefing, it doesn't work like that, just because it's called griefing doesn't mean it's the same thing.

I wouldn't expect you to steal my phone because i stole your chicken wing. I would expect you to steal my chicken nugget. You are basically saying I should expect you to steal everything because i stole from you and it's fine because stealing is stealing.

It's the same with griefing, I would expect you to try to push me after I pushed you, I wouldnt expect to make an enemy for life because i pushed you. 

Of course it's not forbbiden, people can do that, but it's very unreasonable toxic behavior and shouldn't be glorified like people do in this post.
    > I wouldn't expect you to steal my phone because i stole your chicken wing. I would expect you to steal my chicken nugget. 

Well, that's where you're wrong. You shouldn't expect someone to do you wrong at the same level because you did them wrong.

That's like saying I shouldn't expect you to steal -anything- from me, and you did, so therefore, don't expect me to steal whatever equivalent you have because -you- cause the neutrality to tip in the first place. That logic is linear to the overall toxicity.
So if I start in the last row am I legally allowed to stand on the beam?
