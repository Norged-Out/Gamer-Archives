[[I am an AWFUL bean]]





Agent of chaos
    cant even be mad because in the end the game IS about being the last one ~~standing~~ falling.
        yeah literally as i was watching this video i muttered to myself “wow you asshole” and i found myself laughing. it’s crazy how you just can’t get mad at this game at all, even if you’re on the receiving end of the trolling
            You say that...

*UNTIL YOU GET PUT INTO 3 TEAM GAME MODES IN ONE ROUND.*
                LMAO true, that and the SeeSaw shit bruh holy fuck
                    Seesaw is one of the few that I can do very well lol
                        Liar
                        [removed]
                            what is this? why is that here? is that even related to any of the comments?
                    I swear I get the seesaw one more than any other round. Shits annoying
                I hate team tail tag because I'll have a tail and then what?
                    Hold enemies with tails so other colors or your own teammates also can get some. Chances are they might steal yours, but when I've stopped a person the other one chased he stole his tail and we both ran out there with an unbreakable wov of not taking any tails from our colors! 

Atleast I like to think so...
I was 100% rooting for you to fall at 0:45!
    I do not know how I salvaged that
        Karma: "GOT YOU NOW!"

You: "But I haven't even had my waffles yet."
        LOL! Same. Thought for sure you were a goner.
Lol you dickhead but I can't be mad because game.
    I felt rage and then realized I wouldn't have even made it across those yellow things even without him there so, oh well. The guy at the end kind of deserved it.........
        Yes... Why is that part so freaking hard?
            It's sometimes hard because everyones trying to do it once and fucks everyone over. If you wait for a moment where no one is crossing its easy.
                I keep telling myself this and then sliding off. I swear they made it harder at some point, I used to make it over much more frequently. I miss dying to the slick pink stuff instead of the yellow beams, but it's always the beams now.
                    Run up the middle then jump towards the middle and walk straight a couple steps before running and it should help
            I think it is only hard if you're using a mouse and keyboard. With a controller most of this is easy.
            Go to the far left usually everyone is piling on the right one, also take it slow.
            Those things are really sensitive and picky to where you have to hit a really small part in the middle or else you’ll slide off. Push comes to shove, you could probably just go on the first one, to the start of the second, and then jump and dive forward.
            If you're playing on PC, try toggling vsync. Apparently there's a bug where it can make surfaces like the cylinders and the tiles on hexagone and tip toe feel like ice.
                Toggling it off or on?
                    Whichever isn't your current setting
    [deleted]
        I'd be shaking my fist at him if it happened to me.

Oh shit they should add a fist shaking emote.
            You should be able to emote in the air so you could go "CURSE YOUUUU" as you fall to your doom.
        Is it trolling to eliminate your competition? I call that strategy
            [deleted]
                I disagree, trolling is something done for the hell of it. Just for the lulz as the internet used to say.
        It's even strategic. Less people for the next round to compete against, you know?
            What's great is being first to the top, then when you eliminate people via grabbing, you're eliminating the good players who would finish in the top 20. This means that next round, you'll just get a bunch of shitty or new players and increase your odds of winning.
                The good players would know how to avoid his grabbing to be honest lol. The yellow cylinders part can be pretty tricky to navigate with him in the way though.
            Exactly. I said this in another post and a guy replied saying I was wrong and "You don't know what strategy means."

It makes it more likely you will win, how difficult is that to understand.
                Man you really don't know what strategy is, maybe you should look it up.
    He's difinitely a dickhead, but that's the game
God dam no mercy even towards the guy who stayed to see you through
    Pretty sure he ran forward to do exactly what OP did, but OP got the upper hand by jumping over him.
    That guy deserved it. He 100% was there to try and push others off. I feel bad for the others, though.
        Sometimes I stand there just to make people think I'm going to push them off, which distracts them. But then I don't actually push them off if they make it.
            I actually do the same thing.
        How do you know he was 100% going to do anything? He could've just been standing there to see the guy through the finish line
    There is no mercy in the great bean war.
        All's fair in love and fall guys
I usually hate it when people made other people lose. But for some reason I love it when it happen in this game. Even if I'm on the receiving end. Its super funny
    The game could be called grief guys
        well it sure isnt about the nicest guy winning :<
    [deleted]
        Infact you'll always gain kudos or experience every match you play, even if you lose. That's what makes it my "feel good" game
        >Rounds are quick.
>Loading time is fast.

How?
            [deleted]
                Dw I’m just pissed off at how long it takes the game to do menial shit and how many wins have been snatched away from me due to a “connection error” - in the biggest possible air quotes
    I'm glad the community is embracing the trolling, because the first few days people were being such crybabies about stuff like this. Comments on videos like this one would be "wow, imagine thinking this makes you cool" or "isn't it great how other people ruin the game for everyone."

Good to see everyone get on board with the goofy troll strats because they make this game way more fun
        The game is literally about jelly bean people bumping into each other.

The fact you can LONG LIVE THE KING people  only improves the game imo.
        In the long run, this game is going to *need* kings like this to stay fresh. Today I had a match where everyone was trying to do the exact same optimal strategy. It was just dogpiles. That's not what makes this game fun. What makes it fun is when half the time you have no idea why some jerk would dive directly into you, knocking you off course.
        Before the game released I was watching Lirik play the game. He was being a literal crybaby about it as well. He simply couldn't fathom that if the devs didn't want players to grab and push each other then they would've disabled the mechanic outside of gamemodes that specifically require it.

Watching MoonMoon is a lot more fun because he embraces it, occasionally tries it himself, fails miserably and laughs about his own failure.
        Oh boy, they are not embracing it at all, watch how my comments, got downvoted to hell for liking this aspect of the game.
    I think part of it is how cute and colorful the game is, but beneath that thin veneer is a ruthless game of death.
    same haha. the little boops probably help
    Theres only 1 winner.
        If you ask me we're all winners, except for those that get mad for losing
            I need my skin and there's 3 hours left for me to get my kudos.
Slime climb is my favourite because of how unforgiving it is. More of the races should have a way to eliminate beans.
    Slime Climb is my favourite minigame, Roll Out is a close second though, since it also involves MURDER.
        Have you seen the preview for the new mini game in tomorrows update? Lots of beans falling into the slime tomorrow.
            Oh they are doing new maps?

Day made.
                [Yep.  Couldn't find it on mobile so here you go.](https://twitter.com/FallGuysGame/status/1293208481848270851)
                    Ahh so a level they already have but the floor falls through?
                        And the lower beam has two sides like the top, so more jumping required (and more chances for it to align with the top beam).
        Thoughts on block party?
            Trying to murder people on block party usually ends up getting you killed too. Same with jump club. 

I kinda wish block party would get sped up a little, personally, it's a little too easy.
                They have a set where it does trick blocks. Like they pop up in rows and then get capped forming a scoop. I wish all the rotations had a few of those.
        I gotta group up with you. You sound like my kinda guy. Your video is how I play 90% of my games. I kinda wish see saw had like a “life counter” of 3 / 5 to make it more cereal and rewarding to become the bad guy.
    I only hate that it usually eliminates almost everyone. Ive had it as the first round before and only enough made it for the final round. I just feel like the slime should rise a little slower to put it on par with how the other events work
        No way. It's a perfect speed right now. If it was any slower youd have people always standing at the finish line making you wait forever even tho everyone's already done.
            But that doesn't happen in any other game because in every other game it's actually competitive to qualify. In slime climb people can just fuck around like that because generally there are fewer people still alive than there are spots to qualify. I know everyone on this sub loves slime climb but nine times out of ten even if it's the first round it's the last round before the the final round. I just don't think it's in line with the other games in terms of it always eliminating double the number of people it should have. If people were actually afraid of somebody finishing the course before they qualify they wouldn't be jacking around doing nothing the whole time because they don't do that on any of the other obstacle courses
                The point is to eliminate people tho. I much much much prefer elimination through slime climb as opposed to an actual garbage mini game like tiptoes
                Not every game has to be a race. Slime climb is great because it is more about player skill than luck. What makes fall guys great is the almost even mix of skill and luck, it's what makes it so addicting. The worst games imo are the ones where player skill doesn't really factor at all (like tiptoes, final round tail grab, perfect match, the door crashing one to a certain degree, etc)
    I obtained one of my crowns partly because slime climb is so unforgiving. It was the first round and only 5 ppl qualified, so the second round was the finale immediately.
You are going to bean hell for sure.
    Not all beans go to heaven
        Where do gangstas go when they die?
I always fail at those yellow beams, fml. Haven't passed them once
    Aim for the centre with your jump and try not to jump when someone else is going cause there's a fair chance you'll slip.  


You really, really shouldn't be allowed to gate keep on these though, makes it infinitely harder to stick the landing with some asshole (me) trying to push you back off.
    Dude same I’m glad I’m not the only one who can’t do it. I got by on a miracle one time only.
        I really love the slime climb, but it'd be even better if i could qualify on it for one fucking time.
            Lmao right?
    glad I'm not alone! i can't get past them either. :(
    Try tilting your camera to a more overhead view on them, and remember you don't have to jump on the first roller, it's attached.
    I said the same thing here, https://www.reddit.com/r/FallGuysGame/comments/i5qhc8/sitting_on_a_100_lose_rate_on_slime_climb/g0s9zv4/

I failed it so many times. Then someone said something about sliding on tipy toes and i thought yeh i might be sliding off this thing when i jump. His advice Set FPS limit to 60 for fall guys in nvidia control panel, turn vsync on in game. Have not slid off it since. It's now extremely easy.
Jelly Bean Slayer?
    Killer bean
Yes officer, this jelly bean right here
I hate you.
    Love you too.
        How do you push people?
I see a lot of people doing this now but somehow I pulled this off: https://www.reddit.com/r/FallGuysGame/comments/i7wk2t/somehow_i_pulled_off_this_black_magic/
    You can squeeze by if you're fast enough! It's a little harder if the person is actively trying to block you, though guys look like they were just standing there to be an obstacle.
        yeah for sure. It just blew my mind when I get past cuz I've often fell off if I'm not directly on the center of the beams, even when there's no one on them.
            I kind of think this is a little too unfair, though. Like, blocking people on the beams is 100% worse than waiting for them at the end.
                I agree 100%.
    Ugh if this is a trend after a day of me not playing I'm really going to hate slime climb now...
        It's becoming a trend. I've seen it a few times now. My gf got really upset when someone did it to her, she had never made it that far into the game before lol.
Who hurt you?
Had someone stand on the yellow beam like you did earlier, little shits xD
Rend. Kill. Devour your enemies warrior of Fall Guys

Using every trick in the book
Sorry but... fuck you lol
I WANNA BE MAD AT THIS BUT I WAS THE LAST DUDE U PUSHED!!!! U DICK HEAD!!! BUT IT WAS ALL TOO FUNNY!!!
    If you were, I genuinely thought you were going to try and push me too!
        I was just trying to be all HAY U MADE IT!!!! and hugging is a Feature so I was trying to hug you, u so meeeeaaannnnn lol
            If that was true why would you be waiting right at the edge of the slime? Clearly lying dude.
                LOL u getting angry cuz of where I was LOL u must be toxic
                    Nope. Just calling you out for lying.

I also wait there to push people off.
                        LOL ok u decide wut I do for now on sense u know everything and wut I’m gunna do, LOL wut would have been the point to push him if there was room for both of us to qualify LOL
                            I guess the same reason he pushed you. To eliminate the competition. It’s all fun and games until a bean hits the sauce.
                            Ok.
I swear the song for this stage is ripped straight from Splatoon.
You are also bloody awful at completing the course
The road to hell is paved in sins...
I would smash my controller if someone did this to me
You deserve to have your toe stubbed on a moving bike wheel
I realise this is a game, don't take it seriously, blah blah, but I don't like this trend of coming on here to gloat about trolling other players. Trolling is nothing to be proud of.
    In my opinion it'd only be trolling if you didn't benefit from it. Like if you grabbed someone on roll out and took both of you out to spite them. I'm personally fine with this savage playstyle as the whole game is about getting to #1.

I mean don't get me wrong it still feels shit to be on the receiving end but still.
    In this game it is
    Maybe if you’re a weenie
I love doing this too. Also fun when another bean tries to retaliate and block you further along but you slip through.
What does a bean mean
    MICHAEL WHAT DOES A BEAN MEAN
That's the evilest thing I can imagine!
Just know I completely hate you with a hard passion, but damn you executed those moves well
jesus fuck you assassinated three people
congratulations! you are a ***psychopath***.
I hope you get a popcorn kernel stuck in between your teeth and it’s really hard to get out.
Jesus Christ it’s Jason Bourne
Winning crowns is cool but killing other beans is the real deal.
Any hate for this sort of thing is unfounded. Every bean for himself. He played the game aggressively. Didn’t take advantage of exploits. Just did them dirty.
    He didn't need to force people off the edge and make them die to win? It was funny yes but saying that you can't be angry because he was playing the game 'aggressively' is down right stupid
        You miss my point. The game ultimately is a survival game. You want to be the last man standing. So taking out a few in an earlier round is a good strategy.

Additionally, just because my viewpoint differs from yours doesn’t make mine stupid. Relax, don’t take life so seriously.
There is something amazing about messing with people to that freaking song.... it's so funny
    I love the splatoon esque music so much
It is funny because you are mad for everyone, but of course I'd hate it.
You are the enemy of the people
fantastic
You monster 😆😆
This is the nastiest gameplay I’ve ever seen! Noice!
Chaotic Evil
My god dude you even murdered the last guy in cold blood. He was just waiting🤣
The way you wrestled that guy right into the rising slime was absolutely diabolical.
You’re  like Hitler but at least Hitler cared about Germany or something!
You killed two beans. How dare you? Lol
He’s too dangerous to be kept alive!
Some people just want to watch the world burn
Smart AWFUL bean
You are my hero
Definition of a chaotic evil
Greatest thing i've seen on this reddit! Keep it up, make the kids mad!
Ugh this has become meta at this point unfortunately
Damn that was some toxic shit.
    Good
Yeah it's funny on the surface but shit like this is pretty imbalanced and will push new or younger players away from the game. One player at the front shouldn't be able to impede the progress of everyone behind them; that's just poor design.
    ...its a battle royale
        How is that relevant to the imbalance and poor design?
            It’s a BATTLE ROYALE bruh, it’s suppose to be unbalanced
            So there can be only 1 winner..
                [deleted]
                    its litterly designed for people to fall off
~~an Awful~~ Best Bean

FIFY
I hope you go to hell lol
I would absolute hate you
Oh my gosh wow. Best clip I’ve seen. But also the worst lol

I would hate to be any one of those other players.
hahahaha
You’re an asshole
I feel like the people who get killed by these are the same people to complain about a practise mode
You r the worst kind of bean
You might be awful, but the last guy probably deserved it.
I hate you
I was pushed into the slime at the finish line. I was fine and thought it was pretty fun.
OP is going to the hell of Jellybeans
You cold

Killer Bean Forever
I would have lost my mind. So hilarious though.
dude.....
Nice quad feed bro
The way y
How to push others? You just hold grab?
    Hold grab. As long as they dont grab you back you can move them a little and will give them a gentle shove when it breaks after a second or so.

It's not too useful unless you're on a slippery surface or right next to something that can knock them though.
        Thanks. Yeah I know its not that useful but its hilarious. I downloaded this game yesterday and its great.
The end was a bit over the top
Me and my friends call that area the Y-Wing
How do you counter this?
I loved it when he was in the middle and kept looking on at the guy climbing up like he was the death reaper
The last one: "Long live the king!"
youre just a different breed of evil...
I think that some keyboards and joysticks got wrecked in the process 😂😂
You are the type of person that will have me screaming and laughing at my screen
Why bro?
Shithousery of the highest level good sir
The last one deserved it tho 😤
This is toxic, but I can't deny that's it's a viable winning strategy.
You're doing your skin justice. You are the hunter, after all!
I was hoping you'd fall during the troll attempts haha
Ban this man lmao
You sick son of a bitch.
w00 w00 w00
I'd be mad at you, but you're too damn good at what you do.
The last guy waiting there deserved it LOL
The one at the end was so nasty dude, you fucking murdered the guy lol
I'll post the clip of some dude who stood at the top and just yeeted the guy off the edge at the finish line. Saw that and I just had to get the clip cause it made me cry laughing.
You bastatd. You're everything I aspire to be.
I actually enjoyed this lol i do the same and has happened to me before.
Don't hate the player, hate the game.

I almost hope more people adopt the kill everyone else mentality as it would make the game far more chaotic. People scuffling and accidentally killing each other and that sort of thing.
You monster, you should be ashamed
Has someone hurt you in such a way to compel you to do this?
I think hell just opened a special VIP lounge for people like this lol
Lol damn you are a special kind of asshole smh
Welp.  I know what I'll be doing on this specific course from now on.
You will be ashamed for your deeds and actions
Upvote, but I don’t like you.
Omg you sociopath. I pray to never be matched with you lol.
“They said i was a mad man”
This is the best clip I've seen so far... in any game.

Tbh this is the only way I'm actually enjoying the game right now, it gets repetitive fast. This is creative and fun. No more mr. Nice Guy for me.
Ok hello satan
Spit on you
You monsters are the reason I don’t stay at the finish line to hug people.
I hope you have a terrible weekend
With hunter hat I say your a seasoned vet lol good game
No bean is innocent. Don’t feel too bad.
We can tell you’re a wolf skin
Jesus. I hope you get AIDS.
This game is more brutal than MORTAL KOMBAT
Chaotic Evil.

I love it :)
Die.
that last guy deserved it
:|
I FUCKING HATE YOU
Lmfao. You're evil.
You are worse than Hitler
That last guy lowkey deserved it
I was with you until you hated on the waving guy at the end.  You monster. Lol
Booooooooo!
You deserve to burn in the deepest pit of hell
Ok, I think the last one deserved
You absolute monster! (I got a good laugh out of it)
How tf do you have such precise controls? My character is all wonky and won’t even grab correctly. But well played, that was really hilarious, lol.
    It should get patched tomorrow but have you tried turning V-Sync off?
        I’ll check tomorrow when I play again. Have a happy day/night.
Pure evil. Incredible
The killer bean
Good, knock more people out. I need all the help I can get on that 5 wins in row achievement.
This is me on rollout! It’s funny but kinda makes losing easier knowing that I probably deserve it
I hope they eventually add iconic horror movie killer costumes for people like you. Imagine doing this in a Jason or Leather Face costume.
If gotten games where 30+ people die on the second round in this mode
I have the high ground Anakin
Bro gave me stright ideas lmaooo
I love this shit so much, when I'm doing it or even when it's done to me. It's funny as shit everytime
I got exited when you almost fell.
Someone just did this to me....you've created monsters...
Bad bean
Satan called he wants his job back
I'm honestly less mad at this than I get when i simply lose *any* team game. That said, we need a Slime Climb only playlist! I get so excited when it comes up even though I probably only have about a 20% pass rate on it.
I hate you but you make the game more entertaining so I'll let it slide.
youre cracked
You little devil. Now people are gonna start doing this 🤦‍♂️
    There are some of us who have been since the beta lol
There is a special place in hell for you
omg you’re a genius, but a toxic also
That last guy 100% deserved that shit.

The rest of them only 85% deserved it.
Necessary evil
Nice!
Tbh brilliant play
LMFAOOOO
Hope you had fun on Royal Fumble!

    Based on what?
I bet your a PC player
I hate you...but that is pretty cool
Toxic mofo
    ♡
Ha, that baseball wave
Living up to the hunter outfit
That guy at the end lmaoooo
You re a fucking asshole
This Little Timmy is so toxic. All these people were just trying to play the game normally and then the types of people like you come in and ruin the fun for everybody. Also the guy at the end was just waiting for you. Completely unnecessary. SMH.
    Every bean for himself.
    Not sure if you know this but only one player can win. This is simply eliminating the competition and it’s part of the game
    :|
    Wrong game to stand by your morals on.
Awesome, part 2 plz
THERE GOES MY HERO.
If there's a hell, you're going to end up trapped in a room alone with Pee Wee Herman and Boy George.
I mean.....when its either you or someone else competing for the last qualifying spot, I think its fun. But you're just straight up trying fuck people over....all of you guys could've qualified. 

To me, this sucks the fun out of the game. You even said yourself that someone shouldn't be standing on the yellow pillars....but you're doing it unironically?
    It's a competition, get with it already. Everyone can't win.
        I've already won a game tho. I out play guys like this. But, does that mean that they're not allowed to be assholes because of it?
            Dude stop crying, its just a game and not everyone is gonna play like how you want them to. To me this makes the game more fun because I dont take this game that serious.
                Okay? I'm sorry I said what I preferred?.... 

Sorry its not the norm I guess?
            Your entire comment history is a fucking yikes.
                Why? It doesn't matter what I say...because everyone here dislikes it because of reasons?
    I said that it's unbalanced.

I will continue to abuse it to raise awareness that this is something people do. I posted this cause it's a good clip first and foremost, but also it highlights this tactic.

I don't have a problem with fucking other players in slime climb, this is a situation where it's genuinely unfair since you dont have the room to maneuver around the grab.

It's basically a matter of luck if you get past them or not.
        What are you talking about? You said "they really really shouldn't let us stand on them".

Its not unbalanced, its just a tricky part of an obstacle race. I have never seen someone do what you did until now, and the title wasn't something like "hey watch out for this stuff " it was "im an AWFUL bean". Almost as if you enjoy this kind of stuff. 

The last guy I don't care about because he was being an ass. But the guys you stopped at the pillars and then the one you pushed out infront of the moving pillars...well that makes you the asshole
            I think you may want reread this. And consider how you got here. Maybe this isn’t the game for you.
                Lol why? Why is fall guys the most gate kept thing in a while?
            Yes, I did. In the sense that they shouldn't let us be able to gatekeep this chokepoint. Everywhere else on the climb you at least can approach the other player in multiple ways and can dive to avoid them.

And yes, I do enjoy this type of play, but I will admit that something is blantantly unfair. I don't need to highlight with a strobelight in my post that's mostly meant for entertainment. It's there in the footage either way.

I killed them because I wanted less players in the next round to maximise my chances of winning. I did win this game and got my crown. That is after all, the goal of the game.
                I mean I can get wanting to dwindle down numbers for the final, but I have more fun when more people are trying to win. But thats just me.

I guess I just always assume people do this to be an ass and laugh rather then actually make plays.

                        Dude I'm not reading that....this is fall guys not some intellectual shit.

I think he shouldn't do that, because it's a dick move. NOT BECAUSE I THINK MORE PEOPLE SHOULD BE AT THE END.

He does it because he says it helps him secure a better chance at getting first. Okay, makes sense. I THINK ITS MORE FUN TO HAVE MORE PEOPLE IN THE FINAL THAN JUST A FEW.

I didn't say jack shit about how you need to play the game....I only said what I like.
                To fix it they could always make those three pillars rotate so it would be harder for people to stand there and gate keep them. That would just people hate that area more though...
you should concentrate on your own game cuz u are pretty bad
    Considering I won that game, kay dood.
    Lol? He won and it’s not MLG
        I'd watch an MLG version of it
            I agree I’d totally watch an eSports variant of this game

        You say that...

                I swear I get the seesaw one more than any other round. Shits annoying
            I hate team tail tag because I'll have a tail and then what?
                Hold enemies with tails so other colors or your own teammates also can get some. Chances are they might steal yours, but when I've stopped a person the other one chased he stole his tail and we both ran out there with an unbreakable wov of not taking any tails from our colors! 

Atleast I like to think so...
I do not know how I salvaged that
    Karma: "GOT YOU NOW!"

You: "But I haven't even had my waffles yet."
    LOL! Same. Thought for sure you were a goner.
I felt rage and then realized I wouldn't have even made it across those yellow things even without him there so, oh well. The guy at the end kind of deserved it.........
    Yes... Why is that part so freaking hard?
        It's sometimes hard because everyones trying to do it once and fucks everyone over. If you wait for a moment where no one is crossing its easy.
            I keep telling myself this and then sliding off. I swear they made it harder at some point, I used to make it over much more frequently. I miss dying to the slick pink stuff instead of the yellow beams, but it's always the beams now.
                Run up the middle then jump towards the middle and walk straight a couple steps before running and it should help
        I think it is only hard if you're using a mouse and keyboard. With a controller most of this is easy.
        Go to the far left usually everyone is piling on the right one, also take it slow.
        Those things are really sensitive and picky to where you have to hit a really small part in the middle or else you’ll slide off. Push comes to shove, you could probably just go on the first one, to the start of the second, and then jump and dive forward.
        If you're playing on PC, try toggling vsync. Apparently there's a bug where it can make surfaces like the cylinders and the tiles on hexagone and tip toe feel like ice.
            Toggling it off or on?
                Whichever isn't your current setting

    I'd be shaking my fist at him if it happened to me.

Oh shit they should add a fist shaking emote.
        You should be able to emote in the air so you could go "CURSE YOUUUU" as you fall to your doom.
    Is it trolling to eliminate your competition? I call that strategy
        [deleted]
            I disagree, trolling is something done for the hell of it. Just for the lulz as the internet used to say.
    It's even strategic. Less people for the next round to compete against, you know?
        What's great is being first to the top, then when you eliminate people via grabbing, you're eliminating the good players who would finish in the top 20. This means that next round, you'll just get a bunch of shitty or new players and increase your odds of winning.
            The good players would know how to avoid his grabbing to be honest lol. The yellow cylinders part can be pretty tricky to navigate with him in the way though.
        Exactly. I said this in another post and a guy replied saying I was wrong and "You don't know what strategy means."

It makes it more likely you will win, how difficult is that to understand.
            Man you really don't know what strategy is, maybe you should look it up.
He's difinitely a dickhead, but that's the game
Pretty sure he ran forward to do exactly what OP did, but OP got the upper hand by jumping over him.
That guy deserved it. He 100% was there to try and push others off. I feel bad for the others, though.
    Sometimes I stand there just to make people think I'm going to push them off, which distracts them. But then I don't actually push them off if they make it.
        I actually do the same thing.
    How do you know he was 100% going to do anything? He could've just been standing there to see the guy through the finish line
There is no mercy in the great bean war.
    All's fair in love and fall guys
The game could be called grief guys
    well it sure isnt about the nicest guy winning :<

            Dw I’m just pissed off at how long it takes the game to do menial shit and how many wins have been snatched away from me due to a “connection error” - in the biggest possible air quotes
I'm glad the community is embracing the trolling, because the first few days people were being such crybabies about stuff like this. Comments on videos like this one would be "wow, imagine thinking this makes you cool" or "isn't it great how other people ruin the game for everyone."

Good to see everyone get on board with the goofy troll strats because they make this game way more fun
    The game is literally about jelly bean people bumping into each other.

The fact you can LONG LIVE THE KING people  only improves the game imo.
    In the long run, this game is going to *need* kings like this to stay fresh. Today I had a match where everyone was trying to do the exact same optimal strategy. It was just dogpiles. That's not what makes this game fun. What makes it fun is when half the time you have no idea why some jerk would dive directly into you, knocking you off course.
    Before the game released I was watching Lirik play the game. He was being a literal crybaby about it as well. He simply couldn't fathom that if the devs didn't want players to grab and push each other then they would've disabled the mechanic outside of gamemodes that specifically require it.

Watching MoonMoon is a lot more fun because he embraces it, occasionally tries it himself, fails miserably and laughs about his own failure.
    Oh boy, they are not embracing it at all, watch how my comments, got downvoted to hell for liking this aspect of the game.
I think part of it is how cute and colorful the game is, but beneath that thin veneer is a ruthless game of death.
same haha. the little boops probably help
Theres only 1 winner.
    If you ask me we're all winners, except for those that get mad for losing
        I need my skin and there's 3 hours left for me to get my kudos.
Slime Climb is my favourite minigame, Roll Out is a close second though, since it also involves MURDER.
    Have you seen the preview for the new mini game in tomorrows update? Lots of beans falling into the slime tomorrow.
        Oh they are doing new maps?

Day made.
            [Yep.  Couldn't find it on mobile so here you go.](https://twitter.com/FallGuysGame/status/1293208481848270851)
                Ahh so a level they already have but the floor falls through?
                    And the lower beam has two sides like the top, so more jumping required (and more chances for it to align with the top beam).
    Thoughts on block party?
        Trying to murder people on block party usually ends up getting you killed too. Same with jump club. 

I kinda wish block party would get sped up a little, personally, it's a little too easy.
            They have a set where it does trick blocks. Like they pop up in rows and then get capped forming a scoop. I wish all the rotations had a few of those.
    I gotta group up with you. You sound like my kinda guy. Your video is how I play 90% of my games. I kinda wish see saw had like a “life counter” of 3 / 5 to make it more cereal and rewarding to become the bad guy.
I only hate that it usually eliminates almost everyone. Ive had it as the first round before and only enough made it for the final round. I just feel like the slime should rise a little slower to put it on par with how the other events work
    No way. It's a perfect speed right now. If it was any slower youd have people always standing at the finish line making you wait forever even tho everyone's already done.
        But that doesn't happen in any other game because in every other game it's actually competitive to qualify. In slime climb people can just fuck around like that because generally there are fewer people still alive than there are spots to qualify. I know everyone on this sub loves slime climb but nine times out of ten even if it's the first round it's the last round before the the final round. I just don't think it's in line with the other games in terms of it always eliminating double the number of people it should have. If people were actually afraid of somebody finishing the course before they qualify they wouldn't be jacking around doing nothing the whole time because they don't do that on any of the other obstacle courses
            The point is to eliminate people tho. I much much much prefer elimination through slime climb as opposed to an actual garbage mini game like tiptoes
            Not every game has to be a race. Slime climb is great because it is more about player skill than luck. What makes fall guys great is the almost even mix of skill and luck, it's what makes it so addicting. The worst games imo are the ones where player skill doesn't really factor at all (like tiptoes, final round tail grab, perfect match, the door crashing one to a certain degree, etc)
I obtained one of my crowns partly because slime climb is so unforgiving. It was the first round and only 5 ppl qualified, so the second round was the finale immediately.
Not all beans go to heaven
    Where do gangstas go when they die?
Aim for the centre with your jump and try not to jump when someone else is going cause there's a fair chance you'll slip.  


You really, really shouldn't be allowed to gate keep on these though, makes it infinitely harder to stick the landing with some asshole (me) trying to push you back off.
Dude same I’m glad I’m not the only one who can’t do it. I got by on a miracle one time only.
    I really love the slime climb, but it'd be even better if i could qualify on it for one fucking time.
        Lmao right?
glad I'm not alone! i can't get past them either. :(
Try tilting your camera to a more overhead view on them, and remember you don't have to jump on the first roller, it's attached.
I said the same thing here, https://www.reddit.com/r/FallGuysGame/comments/i5qhc8/sitting_on_a_100_lose_rate_on_slime_climb/g0s9zv4/

I failed it so many times. Then someone said something about sliding on tipy toes and i thought yeh i might be sliding off this thing when i jump. His advice Set FPS limit to 60 for fall guys in nvidia control panel, turn vsync on in game. Have not slid off it since. It's now extremely easy.
Killer bean
Love you too.
    How do you push people?
You can squeeze by if you're fast enough! It's a little harder if the person is actively trying to block you, though guys look like they were just standing there to be an obstacle.
    yeah for sure. It just blew my mind when I get past cuz I've often fell off if I'm not directly on the center of the beams, even when there's no one on them.
        I kind of think this is a little too unfair, though. Like, blocking people on the beams is 100% worse than waiting for them at the end.
            I agree 100%.
Ugh if this is a trend after a day of me not playing I'm really going to hate slime climb now...
    It's becoming a trend. I've seen it a few times now. My gf got really upset when someone did it to her, she had never made it that far into the game before lol.
based
If you were, I genuinely thought you were going to try and push me too!
    I was just trying to be all HAY U MADE IT!!!! and hugging is a Feature so I was trying to hug you, u so meeeeaaannnnn lol
        If that was true why would you be waiting right at the edge of the slime? Clearly lying dude.
            LOL u getting angry cuz of where I was LOL u must be toxic
                Nope. Just calling you out for lying.

I also wait there to push people off.
                    LOL ok u decide wut I do for now on sense u know everything and wut I’m gunna do, LOL wut would have been the point to push him if there was room for both of us to qualify LOL
                        I guess the same reason he pushed you. To eliminate the competition. It’s all fun and games until a bean hits the sauce.
                        Ok.
In my opinion it'd only be trolling if you didn't benefit from it. Like if you grabbed someone on roll out and took both of you out to spite them. I'm personally fine with this savage playstyle as the whole game is about getting to #1.

I mean don't get me wrong it still feels shit to be on the receiving end but still.
In this game it is
Maybe if you’re a weenie
MICHAEL WHAT DOES A BEAN MEAN
He didn't need to force people off the edge and make them die to win? It was funny yes but saying that you can't be angry because he was playing the game 'aggressively' is down right stupid
    You miss my point. The game ultimately is a survival game. You want to be the last man standing. So taking out a few in an earlier round is a good strategy.

Additionally, just because my viewpoint differs from yours doesn’t make mine stupid. Relax, don’t take life so seriously.
I love the splatoon esque music so much
Good
...its a battle royale
    How is that relevant to the imbalance and poor design?
        It’s a BATTLE ROYALE bruh, it’s suppose to be unbalanced
        So there can be only 1 winner..

Hold grab. As long as they dont grab you back you can move them a little and will give them a gentle shove when it breaks after a second or so.

It's not too useful unless you're on a slippery surface or right next to something that can knock them though.
    Thanks. Yeah I know its not that useful but its hilarious. I downloaded this game yesterday and its great.
It should get patched tomorrow but have you tried turning V-Sync off?
    I’ll check tomorrow when I play again. Have a happy day/night.
There are some of us who have been since the beta lol
Based on what?
♡
Every bean for himself.
Not sure if you know this but only one player can win. This is simply eliminating the competition and it’s part of the game
:|
Wrong game to stand by your morals on.
It's a competition, get with it already. Everyone can't win.
    I've already won a game tho. I out play guys like this. But, does that mean that they're not allowed to be assholes because of it?
        Dude stop crying, its just a game and not everyone is gonna play like how you want them to. To me this makes the game more fun because I dont take this game that serious.
            Okay? I'm sorry I said what I preferred?.... 

Sorry its not the norm I guess?
        Your entire comment history is a fucking yikes.
            Why? It doesn't matter what I say...because everyone here dislikes it because of reasons?
I said that it's unbalanced.

I will continue to abuse it to raise awareness that this is something people do. I posted this cause it's a good clip first and foremost, but also it highlights this tactic.

I don't have a problem with fucking other players in slime climb, this is a situation where it's genuinely unfair since you dont have the room to maneuver around the grab.

It's basically a matter of luck if you get past them or not.
    What are you talking about? You said "they really really shouldn't let us stand on them".

Its not unbalanced, its just a tricky part of an obstacle race. I have never seen someone do what you did until now, and the title wasn't something like "hey watch out for this stuff " it was "im an AWFUL bean". Almost as if you enjoy this kind of stuff. 

The last guy I don't care about because he was being an ass. But the guys you stopped at the pillars and then the one you pushed out infront of the moving pillars...well that makes you the asshole
        I think you may want reread this. And consider how you got here. Maybe this isn’t the game for you.
            Lol why? Why is fall guys the most gate kept thing in a while?
        Yes, I did. In the sense that they shouldn't let us be able to gatekeep this chokepoint. Everywhere else on the climb you at least can approach the other player in multiple ways and can dive to avoid them.

Thoughts on block party?
    Trying to murder people on block party usually ends up getting you killed too. Same with jump club. 

I kinda wish block party would get sped up a little, personally, it's a little too easy.
        They have a set where it does trick blocks. Like they pop up in rows and then get capped forming a scoop. I wish all the rotations had a few of those.
I gotta group up with you. You sound like my kinda guy. Your video is how I play 90% of my games. I kinda wish see saw had like a “life counter” of 3 / 5 to make it more cereal and rewarding to become the bad guy.
No way. It's a perfect speed right now. If it was any slower youd have people always standing at the finish line making you wait forever even tho everyone's already done.
    But that doesn't happen in any other game because in every other game it's actually competitive to qualify. In slime climb people can just fuck around like that because generally there are fewer people still alive than there are spots to qualify. I know everyone on this sub loves slime climb but nine times out of ten even if it's the first round it's the last round before the the final round. I just don't think it's in line with the other games in terms of it always eliminating double the number of people it should have. If people were actually afraid of somebody finishing the course before they qualify they wouldn't be jacking around doing nothing the whole time because they don't do that on any of the other obstacle courses
        The point is to eliminate people tho. I much much much prefer elimination through slime climb as opposed to an actual garbage mini game like tiptoes
        Not every game has to be a race. Slime climb is great because it is more about player skill than luck. What makes fall guys great is the almost even mix of skill and luck, it's what makes it so addicting. The worst games imo are the ones where player skill doesn't really factor at all (like tiptoes, final round tail grab, perfect match, the door crashing one to a certain degree, etc)
Where do gangstas go when they die?
I really love the slime climb, but it'd be even better if i could qualify on it for one fucking time.
    Lmao right?
How do you push people?
yeah for sure. It just blew my mind when I get past cuz I've often fell off if I'm not directly on the center of the beams, even when there's no one on them.
    I kind of think this is a little too unfair, though. Like, blocking people on the beams is 100% worse than waiting for them at the end.
        I agree 100%.
It's becoming a trend. I've seen it a few times now. My gf got really upset when someone did it to her, she had never made it that far into the game before lol.
I was just trying to be all HAY U MADE IT!!!! and hugging is a Feature so I was trying to hug you, u so meeeeaaannnnn lol
    If that was true why would you be waiting right at the edge of the slime? Clearly lying dude.
        LOL u getting angry cuz of where I was LOL u must be toxic
            Nope. Just calling you out for lying.

I also wait there to push people off.
                LOL ok u decide wut I do for now on sense u know everything and wut I’m gunna do, LOL wut would have been the point to push him if there was room for both of us to qualify LOL
                    I guess the same reason he pushed you. To eliminate the competition. It’s all fun and games until a bean hits the sauce.
                    Ok.
You miss my point. The game ultimately is a survival game. You want to be the last man standing. So taking out a few in an earlier round is a good strategy.

Additionally, just because my viewpoint differs from yours doesn’t make mine stupid. Relax, don’t take life so seriously.
How is that relevant to the imbalance and poor design?
    It’s a BATTLE ROYALE bruh, it’s suppose to be unbalanced
    So there can be only 1 winner..
        [deleted]
            its litterly designed for people to fall off
Thanks. Yeah I know its not that useful but its hilarious. I downloaded this game yesterday and its great.
I’ll check tomorrow when I play again. Have a happy day/night.
I've already won a game tho. I out play guys like this. But, does that mean that they're not allowed to be assholes because of it?
    Dude stop crying, its just a game and not everyone is gonna play like how you want them to. To me this makes the game more fun because I dont take this game that serious.
        Okay? I'm sorry I said what I preferred?.... 

Sorry its not the norm I guess?
    Your entire comment history is a fucking yikes.
        Why? It doesn't matter what I say...because everyone here dislikes it because of reasons?
What are you talking about? You said "they really really shouldn't let us stand on them".

Its not unbalanced, its just a tricky part of an obstacle race. I have never seen someone do what you did until now, and the title wasn't something like "hey watch out for this stuff " it was "im an AWFUL bean". Almost as if you enjoy this kind of stuff. 

The last guy I don't care about because he was being an ass. But the guys you stopped at the pillars and then the one you pushed out infront of the moving pillars...well that makes you the asshole
    I think you may want reread this. And consider how you got here. Maybe this isn’t the game for you.
        Lol why? Why is fall guys the most gate kept thing in a while?
    Yes, I did. In the sense that they shouldn't let us be able to gatekeep this chokepoint. Everywhere else on the climb you at least can approach the other player in multiple ways and can dive to avoid them.

And yes, I do enjoy this type of play, but I will admit that something is blantantly unfair. I don't need to highlight with a strobelight in my post that's mostly meant for entertainment. It's there in the footage either way.

I killed them because I wanted less players in the next round to maximise my chances of winning. I did win this game and got my crown. That is after all, the goal of the game.
        I mean I can get wanting to dwindle down numbers for the final, but I have more fun when more people are trying to win. But thats just me.

I guess I just always assume people do this to be an ass and laugh rather then actually make plays.
            [deleted]
                Dude I'm not reading that....this is fall guys not some intellectual shit.

I think he shouldn't do that, because it's a dick move. NOT BECAUSE I THINK MORE PEOPLE SHOULD BE AT THE END.

He does it because he says it helps him secure a better chance at getting first. Okay, makes sense. I THINK ITS MORE FUN TO HAVE MORE PEOPLE IN THE FINAL THAN JUST A FEW.

I didn't say jack shit about how you need to play the game....I only said what I like.
        To fix it they could always make those three pillars rotate so it would be harder for people to stand there and gate keep them. That would just people hate that area more though...
I'd watch an MLG version of it
    I agree I’d totally watch an eSports variant of this game
Apparently stupid toxic shits who think every BR game is competitive and you have to be good to enjoy it
i can guarantee im not worse

        I really wish we had access to stats pages
You say that...

*UNTIL YOU GET PUT INTO 3 TEAM GAME MODES IN ONE ROUND.*
    LMAO true, that and the SeeSaw shit bruh holy fuck
        Seesaw is one of the few that I can do very well lol
            Liar
            [removed]
                what is this? why is that here? is that even related to any of the comments?
        I swear I get the seesaw one more than any other round. Shits annoying
    I hate team tail tag because I'll have a tail and then what?
        Hold enemies with tails so other colors or your own teammates also can get some. Chances are they might steal yours, but when I've stopped a person the other one chased he stole his tail and we both ran out there with an unbreakable wov of not taking any tails from our colors! 

Atleast I like to think so...
It's sometimes hard because everyones trying to do it once and fucks everyone over. If you wait for a moment where no one is crossing its easy.
    I keep telling myself this and then sliding off. I swear they made it harder at some point, I used to make it over much more frequently. I miss dying to the slick pink stuff instead of the yellow beams, but it's always the beams now.
        Run up the middle then jump towards the middle and walk straight a couple steps before running and it should help
I think it is only hard if you're using a mouse and keyboard. With a controller most of this is easy.
Go to the far left usually everyone is piling on the right one, also take it slow.
Those things are really sensitive and picky to where you have to hit a really small part in the middle or else you’ll slide off. Push comes to shove, you could probably just go on the first one, to the start of the second, and then jump and dive forward.
If you're playing on PC, try toggling vsync. Apparently there's a bug where it can make surfaces like the cylinders and the tiles on hexagone and tip toe feel like ice.
    Toggling it off or on?
        Whichever isn't your current setting
You should be able to emote in the air so you could go "CURSE YOUUUU" as you fall to your doom.

    I disagree, trolling is something done for the hell of it. Just for the lulz as the internet used to say.
What's great is being first to the top, then when you eliminate people via grabbing, you're eliminating the good players who would finish in the top 20. This means that next round, you'll just get a bunch of shitty or new players and increase your odds of winning.
    The good players would know how to avoid his grabbing to be honest lol. The yellow cylinders part can be pretty tricky to navigate with him in the way though.
Exactly. I said this in another post and a guy replied saying I was wrong and "You don't know what strategy means."

It makes it more likely you will win, how difficult is that to understand.
    Man you really don't know what strategy is, maybe you should look it up.
I actually do the same thing.
[deleted]
    Dw I’m just pissed off at how long it takes the game to do menial shit and how many wins have been snatched away from me due to a “connection error” - in the biggest possible air quotes
I need my skin and there's 3 hours left for me to get my kudos.
Oh they are doing new maps?

Day made.
