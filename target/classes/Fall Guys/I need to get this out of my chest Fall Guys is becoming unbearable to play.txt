[[I need to get this out of my chest Fall Guys is becoming unbearable to play]]


Feel free to ignore this if you're really a die-hard fan of the game or anything, or if you don't like long texts, it's just me letting go my frustrations with this game, which are a lot.

Firstly, the repeatability: today I tried to play it peacefully, until it wasn't. Door Dash (the warped version, which is even worse itself) was the first map, solo or squads, for EIGHT CONSECUTIVE times. Seriously? There's SEVENTY SIX different maps in this game, and yet the same keeps repeating itself.  Why the same over and over and over and over again? This is frustrating, and makes you get tired of the game sooooo much quickly. It's annoying, and it's not the first time it happened. Cool maps like Airtime or even Lily Leapers are a rare thing now. They used to be common, and now we're stuck with these horrible new maps or, like I said, the same maps like Door Dash, repeating themselves over and over again. It's really fucking annoying.

&#x200B;

Speaking of annoying, well... there's the players. Half of them are idiots, and the other half is made of assholes, it's impressive. EVERY FUCKING GAME I play, there's always that idiot trying to grab you for no reason whatsoever, the guy that keeps pushing you also for no reason, or the guy who'll do both. I was at the end of Cosmic Highway in the last platform, readying to do the last jump straight to the finish line when a fucking moron grabbed me exactly when I decided to jump. I didn't qualified because of that. What's your fucking problem? Why grab someone for NO REASON in a solo map? There's still had plenty of spots left, there was no reason for him to grab me, he could've just go the finish line. 

And there's also the idiots, those guys who don't know how to fucking play it and keep going to squad games. The guy can't even finish Dizzy Heights, which is probably the easiest map in the game right now in this season, hence there's almost no obstacles at all, it's just a straight race, and yet they keep on playing squads, prejudicing the whole team for being an idiot. It's either that or the guy who keeps falling or stuttering in every corner of the map, or even that dumb fuck who keeps pressing all the pixels on Pixel Painters (this map itself is already an HORRIBLE idea).

&#x200B;

Another issue is the game itself, it's clumsy gameplay, and the bugs (a LOT of bugs, btw). Your character will always fall down like a fucking idiot, landing on his head or on his face and keeps rolling on the ground. This happens to me like 9 times out of 10 and pisses me off. If that wasn't annoying enough, now after this update is 10 times worse to grab or to jump. Jumping is a crucial part of the gameplay and now if you decide to jump in the last second there's no way you'll pass through a level, cause the fucking character WON'T JUMP anymore. Wall Guys is already a terrible map and now it's a complete nightmare to pass through thanks to the awful "new" gameplay.

Addressing the bugs now, the last update broke Full Tilt. It was easy to jump to the platforms, no matter how many players were by your side. Then the update came, and the whole platform just flips and no one else can get through. It took almost 2 minutes to stabilize so me and other guys could get through the first one. I think it's normal again by now, this happened a few days ago, but that's not the first time that something like that happened on a map after an update. 

And of course, not to mention when your character keeps getting stuck in nowhere, especially in The Whirlygig. Sometimes you're not even close to the huge fans and still your character gets hit or stuck in one of them, outta nowhere.

&#x200B;

The updates keep ruining the game every single time. This one ruined the gameplay and added some horrible new variations for the maps and added even worse maps to the game as well, and like I said, sometimes it ruins the maps adding more bugs to the game. Seriously, I like this game a lot but it's becoming more and more exhaustive to play it. You can't have a good time anymore, it's just painful to play whether it's because of the players, the maps or even the game itself that's broken now.

What are your thoughts on this? I'm seriously thinking of not playing Fall Guys anymore...


I did noticed my bean guy rolling like a sausage weenie more often recently. It is annoying when you're unable to get up in time. I also encountered the invisible wall a few times too. But what frustrates me is still continually how expensive everything is in the shop. The move to have items for 3.99 plus crown bucks idk is alright but the fact they killed kudos as the main currency and made simple items worth a lot of kudos exasperating - I only have 4600 and I'm not gonna drop half on cat ears no matter how cute they are.
    Yeah, that's also another thing I forgot to mention along with the issues finding players: the shopping of this game is TERRIBLE. Everything is expansive as fuck and you won't earn a fucking kudo\[s\] in any way. 200 by daily challenge is absolutely nothing when things are that expansive in the shop. It's basically a way to make people buy the fucking stuff using money, not a pay to win but a lot microtransations just to earn that extra money with easy cash-grab. That's ridiculous.

You at least have something, I have only 700. Last time I spent 2100 with that lemon-coloured glasses (I wanted to get it since my character is usually green, so it would fit with the colors and shit)
Was playing duos last night and got warped door dash every single time the first game. And then the second one was always dizzy heights. It was obnoxious.
    To me it was the same with squads, only difference the second map was always Pixel Painters
I am also frustrated at the bugs, and change in mechanics. The repeated levels is a very annoying concept as well. As far as grabbers, we’ll that’s the game. It’s a skill to know not to jump when someone is behind you. Do a quick spin, drop them, or find another spot. That’s literally Fall Guys. I do wish levels timed out faster, especially when dummies are just standing there. Wall Wall Guys is a great map that takes a lot of skill to be good; I’m sorry you were already bad at it. It is definitely worse now, though. Pixel takes brains, and as long as you don’t have random partners, it’s an instant win for everyone. Great idea! I do wish my character still jumped properly, but I have already adjusted. Full Tilt is indeed very broken. And just remember, it’s owned by Epic Games now, which is about quantity over quality. They don’t care about gamers or fun; just your money. So shut up and buy more costumes, because that’s all Fall Guys is good for anymore, apparently.
(PS, that last sentence was sarcasm. Don’t shut up, and don’t spend anymore money on this trashy money-grabbing company)
    Wall Guys is much much worse now thanks to Mediatonic ruining the fucking gameplay. I have to disagree it's a great map, it's a terrible one. I'm halfway decent on it but it sucks, it's just awful people taking away the boxes you just placed to jump to and some other shit, it's one of the most annoying levels ever. Thankfully there's those airboxes now that make it at least a little bit more tolerable.

\>Pixel takes brains

That's exactly the problem, a lot of people who play this game don't have a fucking functional brain like I said, there's so many goddamn idiots and they ALWAYS are on my team.

Yeah it's owned by Epic but Fortnite is also owned by them, and yet I don't see the game so broken and with so many problems like Fall Guys has.
        Let’s start with Fortnite. That is absolute trash. Built that way. It’s where children go so actual gamers can have peace. So there’s no comparison. 
In wall Guys, the fans (in my sole opinion) are pathetic and cheap, and helps unskilled players get to the end faster. If you are fast, people moving the boxes don’t affect you.  I have noticed that grabbing is not working well, though. But that happened a month ago. 
For Pixel, I don’t play with randoms; if I’m alone, I play solo. If you want a squad to play with, add me: WhereMyDaddyGo. We have fun, are nice, and chat on Discord, too. No one should have to play with randoms. I’m sorry.
            I can't understand this blind hate people have for Fortnite. It's just an average battle royale game that, yes, has a lot of children playing it but it doesn't make it a bad game because of that. I remember when Minecraft suffered a similar hate, where people simply didn't wanted nothing to do with the game because it was related to children very commonly.
                My hate for Fortnite isn’t blind. I played it a good bit. I hate it for many reasons similar to why Fall Guys is falling apart. Because it’s geared towards weak gamers and not skill, while profits are prioritized. Skill and strategy is why I game. I love Minecraft. You need skill for that game. There’s no money grabs. It’s a real game, and I’m grateful even children could enjoy it, while pros can, too. Fortnite is not the same.
        And I’ve posted about it before, but I used to work for a great, loving company and when it was bought by a larger one with no heart, I watched the company go down in flames due to priority shifting from love to money. The same exact process is happening thanks to Epic.
I was a die hard fan of the game but to be honest I just want to finish the season pass and delete the game.

There is something important that Epic obviously knows but they just don't give a fuck, this game is more about luck than skill, of course there is people who are monsters in the game but most of the people who played the game weren't like that and the devs knew it that's why the crowns were part of the design of the game for people to have de desire to win. Now that everything is "Give me $20" for this and for that and there is literally no reason to try to win and to be honest there aren't many to keep playing.

The level design has gone to hell, every level had a lot of work behind them and know everytime they change something it feels more annoying that exciting. 

It's kind of sad because i had a lot of fun with the game but sometimes it's just better to let go.
    That's exactly what I think about the game rn, and that's a shame.
You guys still playing this? I do not enjoy the game anymore. It's becoming worse.
Skill issue it seems
    Not exactly, I think I'm at least average to good at this game. Those things I've mentioned are the ones that piss me off.
    110%
Aggreeee.. i am trying to get into a show for like 30 minutes. Tried to quit, play again but no match found..its fucked up.
    Honestly, same.  I've been playing almost daily since July, but stopped a few days after the wormhole event started.  It's not even fun anymore with all the bugs.
    This just started happening to me.
    This is another problem I forgot to mention: the search for players is terrible too. And the balance of the teams is awful, you're screwed if you're in three players instead of four, so the most logical thing the game should do is place everyone with only 3 members or wait until all teams have 4.
    Have you tried changing your region from Auto to the place you're located?
I do not understand why people get so mad when others grab and push them to try to eliminate them. It’s not for “no reason.” There can only be one winner in solo - why would you not try to take down as many people as you can so long as you are going to advance? The people “grabbing and pushing” are utilizing the early rounds to try to eliminate as many players as they can so when they are in the subsequent rounds there is less competition.

I honestly don’t get why people get so angry about others grabbing. It’s literally part of the game and a solid strategy.
    Bc we’re tired of being fucked over by the bullshit. We’re trying to have a casual game. We’re not upset we’re losing, we’re upset ppl are keeping us from actually winning. That’s what the obstacles are for. Who told these assholes to do the course’s job for it? You gonna defend gtao griefers next?

I know kids will react like this so thats why I do it lol
    So you're one of the idiots that grab people just for the sake of grabbing people and making them mad? Amazing.
        I picture them actually getting mad over a kids game. Thanks for showing me they actually do lol
            Not a kid here tho, just a guy who's tired and wanted to have a good time in this game, only to have assholes who like to grab people for no reason to ruin everything.
                perfect
You need to uninstall and move on. You let fall guys get you tilted. Fucking LOL.
    Problem is, as much as this game pisses me off I still want to keep on playing it. Recently I'm not in the mood to play anything else, if wasn't for that I probably would've uninstalled it already.
It is very annoying lately. 
Awe but let’s play fall guys together ! 
I used to be obsessed and lately I don’t enjoy it for the same reason. It’s such a shame
The random grabbers piss me off too.

I understand tactical grabbing but why do it when it serves no purpose? I spent a few hours after work grinding ski fall today just because it’s mindless and I can chill out while watching TV and there were so many random people just standing and grabbing people before jumps. Why? Everyone that does the challenge qualifies. How sad is your life if you’re choosing to waste your time doing that when you could be doing literally anything else
They tease you with all the good games, block party, hexagone, then make you play the same shitty game over and over and over and over and over again. But the most annoying thing? I’m SICK AND FUCKIN TIRED A PLAYING THE GAME THE WAY ITS MEANT TO BE PLAYED, JUST FOR IT TO KEEP TURNIN AROUND AND FUCKIN ME OVER. IM DONE!
