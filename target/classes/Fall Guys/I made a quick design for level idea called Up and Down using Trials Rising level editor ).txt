[[I made a quick design for level idea called Up and Down using Trials Rising level editor )]]





I would love this race as a finale actually - Not a short race like Fall Mountain where 1 mistake/a ball to the face usually means you're out of the run of winning - Here it's possible to make mistakes and still be in the run for the crown (Or catch up to the leader)

I really like the idea!  


EDIT: Better wording.
    I'd prefer it as a starting level. There'd be so much chaos especially at those lifts where you could throw people off.
        Why not both
            Both is good
            Agreed, I feel like every level should hve the option of being a final level.
                Imagine high intensity last man standing for a fruit matching game!
                    Just have more fruit every round. Eventually each tile will be a different fruit
                        Oh no. 16 fruit would be tough to memorize. It would probably result in a lot of draws
                            That'll only be the last round. Doubt most people will make it that far

On the later rounds, you'll have to take a gamble with what fruits to memorize. You won't be able to do all of them, but maybe you get lucky and memorize the right one? 

If you don't get the right one, you can always go back to the strategy of following everyone else
                No, both as in first *AND* last. 60 player race to the crown.
                    That would be fun.  I thought that’s how the game was before I played it, one race, one winner.
                    In that case the race shouldn't be called up and down it should be alpha and omega
            Bro slime climb for the final would be amazing
                Then it becomes a competition only for those who know the shortcuts especially the hammer skip.
    And this is why this game needs a map editor with a voting system. Good made maps will be voted by the community and introduced into the official map pool.

Edited i think
        A map editor would be great for the lifespan of the game, and could even be used for competitions to turn some into offical maps!
        You must be hungry.
            -_- i need to change my phone
        A map editor would be amazing.  Anything that helps the community do the dev's work for them should be a no brainer.
            I fully agree in the way that they could have anyone make a map and then every week or month the community could vote out if 5 maps or so for what one can be included in the game!
        Remindme! 1 year

If this isn't a thing by then I'll eat a gummy worm
    Yep this would be so much better as a finale than Royal Fumble or Fall Mountain.  IMO  Fall Mountain is too short and Royal Fumble is stupid.
        You mean you don’t love holding the tail for 1:26 for a Dino to just walk up and steal it from you last second?
            Your mistake is playing at all for the first minute and 10 seconds, just find a nice spot and emote until its game time. Chances of winning are the same, but losing stings less.
            What’s this walk up bullshit? They steal it from 10 meters away and then I run into them with my grabby hands out and nothing happens, because I don’t deserve a tail buttplug.
            [deleted]
                My favorite was when I held the tail for the entire round and as soon as the timer hit zero because a man standing near me had his arms out and I was forced to stop they got the tail and won.

I just sat there for a moment like  "Yes this was fair and I did not hate it."
                    [deleted]
                        I was in game development and I know it's hard once online play becomes a thing so I'm trying to be patient but this stuff happens a lot and I find myself being pushed away from playing more y'know?
        Royal Fumble!? Wow that's a final I haven't played in a while. Is that still in the pool?
            Hopefully not once season 2 comes out
        You should see Game Theorys new video. He took a pill and tail tag was literally voted as the worst game. I think it was like 45% of the votes
    I would love fall mountain as a 1st round map
        Yes
    I disagree. The final race should be pretty short, with obstacles that have a good chance of tripping you up even with a small density of people. The way this map, and most of the other early race maps that this one is trying to be like are designed is to take full advantage of a big mob of people getting in each other’s way more than the actual obstacles do. 

This looks like it was made to capitalize on the chaos of 60 people trying to race to the finish and getting in each other’s way. Especially the elevator part. If there were only 10 or so people every obstacle would be way too easy to avoid and it would have an even bigger problem of “whoever starts in front is guaranteed to win”
        yes, this map works better as a starter, but its still better as a finale than fall mountain. there just isnt ENOUGH obstacles to trip people up on fall mountain. its too common to just hold forward and make it through cleanly with minimal sidestepping, and you're STILL neck and neck with somebody else. there isnt enough chance for people to catch up. there isnt enough chance for leaders to flub something. one minor inconvenience and you're basically fucked. with this stage, there is still a lot of precision jumping necessary. thats a lot of chances for leaders to screw up.
    Team this is my problem with most of the finals, one mistake and you have most likely lost. Would be fun with some longer obstacle courses where you can actually make a comeback.
        Except people will get really good at this map and it will turn out 1 mistake means you lose on this one, too.
            Unless they manage to make it a bit randomized which obstacles are spawned each round. Would be awesome if they added some randomized levels.
    I think the problem with this being a finale is that there are a lot of places where you can just fall into the void.
        It’s a race, but as a finale. There would be checkpoints along the way just like any other race map.
This is impressive. Hope the devs see it
    u/MediaTonicGames ?
        u/fallguysjoe
            u/cottoneyejoe 

Where did you come from? Where did you go?
    Is this a Norbert Moses I see??
This is a very good idea ngl
    I like it a lot but It's a little long. If you cut out the first and third section, I think it'd work much better as a finale game.

I *do* like the idea of longer, more difficult races, though. 

The unfortunate thing is that the more difficult a map is, the more the skill gap increases and you might lose the immense amount of casual players since it'd feel like they have even less of a chance when pros start making it to the end of maps when they're only halfway through.
        I like that it's longer for a finale. I think Fall Guy Mountain is the worst ending because of how short it is. You make one mistake or get hit by an RNG ball and it's over.
            What does RNG stand for sorry

Edit research still pending but it may, maaay mean Random number generator. Lol seriously though thanks for the answers!
                Random number generator, it just means it’s a random event like in what direction is the ball going to spawn
                So far 6 people answered and I fear it might not be enough.  
So I would also like to tell you it stands for Random Number Generator.
                    Oh look 12 of the same answer i better get in there and make sure they saw it!
                Random Number Generation, i.e the balls aren’t spit out based on a pattern or anything. Instead numbers are generated randomly in the background and when a certain value is reached, a ball spits out.
                It means Nandom Gumber Renerator, of course.
                RNG itself stands for Random Number Generator, but the term is used for elements in games which are determined by chance i.e. the random nature in which the balls roll down the hill
                Random number generation
                Random Number Generator - basically randomness over skill
        I hate this way of thinking. Long levels are sooo much more fun. 

Hit parade: oh suddenly its over as all 40 people cross at once...

See Saw: long time to complete, you can mess up and be ok, feels like an actual competition
        They should add a “ranked” with more difficult maps maybe even a squad playlist with only team based maps for u and your buddies
        This is a problem that’s already happening. The “skilled” people are outpacing the casual players and I don’t like it. They need to figure out a way to even the playing field like it was when it first came out.
            It's the multiplayer curse, every game is afflicted. Go try Tetris 99 nowadays.
                Couldn't win even in the beginning
            Lol that’s pretty much impossible to do without making the game trash. Developers have been trying to do it the past 10 years
            People getting better at anything is not a problem, it's human nature at it's core. It's happened in every game ever made and will happen in every game ever created in the future. People playing the same game repeatedly and never improving is a problem.
            I know exactly what you mean and that first 2 weeks was incredible before people learned the Meta routes. The game works best when it combines luck and skills fairly. However I cant even begin to imagine how hard that is to achieve.
    Why would you lie in the first place????
This is super creative! I really love the vertical climb with the moving platiforms, fall guys stages really need more verticality imo
    Yep that's the real centre piece of this level, I can just imagine so much chaos and hilarious shithousery in those mini elevators
        Those mini elevators already made me sick with tears of frustration lol
        Shithousery is one of my favourite words and so rarely seen on Reddit.
    Its a great idea but how would you deal with a player getting pinched between two platforms? eject them off the lift?
        That's a possibility, or just not have them connect and spaced slightly further above and below so you have to jump from one to the next
        They could just keep it simple, player gets cut in half and eliminated.
There’s obviously a cheater in it already. He’s at the finish line and celebrating before anyone else has even started.
    *It was* **probably** *their first time.*
        They just happen to be wearing a ninja suit that costs ten crowns or whatever
damn some of these obstacles are really creative! this would make a great final level
    You could split this into three parts and each one would be a solid level!
Nice! Would love some longer levels like this in the real game.
God, I hate talented people. That looks amazing.
Section with the rollers should have something to slow you down on the bottom or everyone would jump down but in general  this looks very fun,
Edit: typo
    uphill slimb climb maybe.. with hammers
    Came here to say this. The roller part would be faster for people who just jump down and avoid it.
    who's Gerald? Am I missing something here?
Woah this is great. How’d you make it?
    Thank you! I made it using in-game editor of Trials Rising. Yes, a motorcycle game :D
        How did you get it to look so close to the fall guys style? Is the editor just that versatile, or did you have to import stuff into it?
            All items are made in the editor. It's amazingly versatile and powerful editor although it takes some time to get used to :)
                Wow! I'll have to check it out! I guess we have to make do until they see fit to give us an official editor.

Anyway, brilliantly done! Hopefully this gets all the recognition it deserves.
                We need to get you creating in Dreams on PS4. This is pretty cool and your Trials tracks are always great. You'll feel right at home in Dreams. It has a lot of similarities to the Trials editor.
                YOU’RE an amazingly versatile and powerful editor :)
        You would be doing the world a favor if you learned Unity. Seeing this piece of macgyvered motorcycle game art makes me think you would build something amazing given real tools :)
This is so good, you have a great talent for designing courses! Please do more, I'd love to see them.
    Thank you! I plan on making more, it was a fun project :)
        Also, I really hope that they add a level editor eventually. I think you would be able to make amazing levels!
Ugh. The levitating circles at the end would be maddening... I wanna play it.
    The center circles should have pink sludge on them!
#Mad Wipe-out feels and I dig it!
    How do you make your text thicc?
        Put a " # " sign in front of the object you want enlarged/bolded. It'll make everything connected to it in that sentence or paragraph bigger and bolder. The more "# " signs you put the smaller the text'll be; I think 3 or 4 is the maximum effect.
 
- #SHAZAM

For just bold text put " ** your subject in between the asterisks ** " 

- **A-Prestamundo**
            #*Ñ*
this would be an amazing finale course, starting course, legiterally could fit whenever in the game. props to you man this is insane
    Did you just make up a new word?
    Might be too hardcore as a starting round, maybe 2nd/3rd but the bottomless jumps at the end might make this too extreme for anything but a finale
        I dont understand, there are falls in see saw and whirly-do. Why is that bad for starting level?
            I guess if there's a checkpoint right before the falls then you're right it's not an issue.
I really like hte 2 part elevator thing, that should be in the game somewhere, bu I think the big grid that goes up and down would be easily exploitable
    Well that’s the thing, skilled players should be able to exploit stuff like that. Same thing with the shortcuts in Slime Climb
🥇
    I would honestly gild the fuck outta OP if I didn’t live off of food stamps
That's a really cool concept.
Holy shit this is amazing, I'd love to see it added!
I love it all, but especially the elevator part
Quick design? Haha I know you put a decent amount of work into this and it’s awesome! I’ve been craving a race that’s long and this thing looks fun!
“quick design” lmao
Stumble Guys copied this😭
I think they made new ss2 maps inspired by this one.
All good except the squares with bars. People will run on top of the bars there.
    That's  what seperates Fall Guys from Decending Gentlemen.
        Not if hitting the bars bounce you around covered in slime!
    And? That seems like a viable option
    I feel like that's the intention. Try to run on a rounded bar, potentially falling and losing more time, or just waiting, which is also losing time.
That is brilliant, must've taken a lot of effort!
This is fantastic , i would love to play in this map . And i guess cheaters will have a long time to wait after winning they could just get bored and leave . Win win .
That actually looks fucking awesome, maybe as a final to replace royal fumble
Yo, this would be funnnnn. Someone get the developers over here stat! Nicely done OP
You’re telling me this isn’t professionally made?
This level looks good! But even if this exact level is not implemented the obstacles can be used in other future levels.
This shit is massive bruh, amazing job. It would be amazing to have a map editor and the devs letting us vote things like this. That would inject so much variability to the game
This is the final we need
that 3 2 1 Go sound gave me some nostalgia
This would be a great final round!
Very cool!
Im going to go out and say it. this is better than the other fall guys maps.
All these concepts make me excited about the potential of the game.
Holy crap, that's awesome! Looks like you put a lot of thought and effort into this, I really like the little elevator part. My only concern is that it's a little bit too long as the floating platforms look cruel, though I might be wrong lol.

Seriously though, I feel like you should be hired for this, it's excellent.
I'm already screaming at some kid for knockng me off the wall lift thing
I love this map idea! Would be brutal to new players (Kinda like Seesaws), but would still be fun for everyone!

&#x200B;

You may want to try tweeting at the Fall Guys twitter account. They love this type of stuff.
Now post a video of you doing the course on a Trials bike.
Wow, they shoud put this in game becauss there is not enough maps
If you don't do this for a living, you should. This is an awesome map!
Mediatonic, hire this man.

Seriously though, this looks awesome. I think the end looks a little dull though, and the reward for making it across those spinning tubes should be very high because that looks hard.
This is brutal. Hope it can somehow make it into the game.
Put a downwards escalator on the last slope and then a jump to the finish line
10/10 would love to play this. Only if it were like slime climb though, where one fall equals death.
    I can already see me and the boys camping those last orange circles and eliminating everyone
This is 10x better than tip toe, door dash, tail tag games, see saw, and most of the team games
Thats sick! looks a bit long for fall guys, seeing as theyre usually under a minute
Omggggg the elevator looks awesome
i see a lot of people say this would be a great finale course but i think it’s in the same rank as whirlygig, its good for a bit of chaos but its pretty big so it won’t feel overflowed
    My thoughts exactly. This, Whirlygig, and Slime Clime make great 1st and 2nd round games, especially since chaos is a ladder
The floating platforms look like chaos
Constructive criticisms:

The rising bars at the start - I could see that potentially causing clipping issues if it comes down on top of a player (forcing them into the floor, launching them or some other weird behaviour). You could fix it by making them solid walls maybe?

Same thing for the rising steps, if a player is stood on the edge and the one above comes down on them it might cause some weirdness. You could fix those by leaving a player-width gap between them. Also it looks too high tbh. It would take approx. 12 seconds to get up by my calculations - and that's if you do it first time with no mistakes. Making it 2 or 3 high instead of 5 might be better?
They need to add a mode called, "community" (or something like that) where people can build their own maps for players to play! (but it doesnt give them Kudos or crowns)
I already raged quit twice and haven't played it yet.
Coming back a month later remembering when we thought there were gonna be so many cool new levels in Season 2...
Imagine having better ideas than the devs
Please show footage of it being played!!
Yes.
Fucking sick man!!
Holy shit thats good
Very impressive
Looks awesome
omg 0:28 would be such a good idea :0
Looks nice. 🙂
This is crazy good
This looks way too stressful. 

I love it.
Awesome
I love this. But im also worried about a cheater who will just fly and get the crown without a sweat. Im not sure maybe im traumatized.
This looks cool but damn it would take forever for everyone to finish.
Damn okay Satan calm down please

No but seriously I would both love and hate this level a lot! The devs should give you a job!
This looks like a ton of fun!
Nani?! I waana it in game!
Very epic
This is awesome. Inventive yet still in line with the other races already in the game, albeit a little longer, but that’s not a bad thing. Really good work, hope this is considered in the next season!
This is nicely done! Waaaanttt
This is the coolest map idea I've seen on here! Hope the devs get some ideas from this.
This is already anger enducing and I'm only 3 seconds in.
I like the "elevators"
I wanna play this!
Yes please
I love the obstacle type games, would LOVE to see more like this!
This is immense. This is what a final level should be like. It would actually test skill instead of just putting you on a hill and randomly lobbing balls at you. Make Fall Mountain look like absolute trash.
That is awesome, man. I genuinely hope this gets added.
Fall Guys developers please have this replace Fall Mountain in Season 2!
This would be chaotic as hell. I love it
Fall Guys really need a level creator ASAP.
Those rotating bits at about 14 seconds are a little pointless but otherwise this has so many fun looking segments.
This is awesome !!!! Could you make some sort of pink goo water slide with holes and jumps kinda like the end of gate crash but longer!!
This is incredible. I want to play it so bad. A long marathon finale race level like this would be awesome.
u/vredditdownloader
I want that
Wow, this is good
I really like your idea! Would love to race there anytime but I think it’s really long and there are too many different obstacles, you could have 2 different levels just from this on. Amazing job!
This is awesome, and would be perfect as a finale - long enough and with enough crazy hazards that there would be some great moments of the frontrunner making a terrible mistake that changes the outcome of the match. I love it. 

That being said, I'm not sure I understand the design philosophy of the rotating balance beams (why not just jump down and run a straight line?) or the yellow grids that come out of the floor (just line up with it and run along the top). Aside from that though, I've been wishing for more challenging levels, and this looks like exactly what I want.
You hate us don't you?
we need more skilled races like this
I LOVE THIS IDEA.

It would be chaos but also fun
This looks fun! And it also fills a need since there really aren’t any games that include vertical elements in a race. Really great idea
This would be a god tier level.
Gotta make those round platforms tilt when people stand on them to really up the rage
Love the idea!

The two spinning rollers seems a bit out of place though, maybe remove that section
After the third obstacle I was like omg there's more, holy fuck that's hard as, oh it's too much. In conclusion your a diabolical monster
its cool but way too long
Awesome. Make fall mountain a level 1/level 2 race, make this level the finale.
Fucking incredible work. HIRE THIS MAN NOW
Man that platform wall that moves up and down and the squares where the yellow bars are sick!! 

On the cylinder rotating wheels that go left then the next goes right then left then right looks like it would be better to just jump down and run instead of running across cause on other game modes ie slime climb where you run across but the platform moves to your left take forever to run across

Overall tho excellent design
They should just go ahead and hire you now as a level designer
This looks so painful to get through, I want it
Imagine a community map builder
I see allot of comments staying this should be a final level. I would like this to be a first level so I have a chance of playing it.
Wow that's nice
This is awesome
I really hope they add a ton of new maps to the game
This looks awesome and I can already see me getting mad when I mess up.
Needs more spinny things at the lasts platforms for maximum frustration
Looks really awesome and I think you did a great job. I’m wondering how the physics engine would interact with this level in two places:
- where the grid is going up and down, what happens if you get stuck under the grid and it chomps down on you. Seems like you would be stuck there forever.
- where there’s the “ladder” platforms going up and down (obviously) what would happen if you get squished between one coming down on your head as your platform goes up?

Just some thoughts... looks great!
Give this person a job!
This looks cool! I would struggle though lol
I really hope devs take these levels into consideration. 

I know they are going with a medieval theme next szn and makes me think if they are just going to stick with 2-3 new games every szn to make it match the theme instead.
Those spinning wheels with the directional rotation will be impossible to get over. The guys already move slow enough on ones that are all pointing the same direction. I find it hard to believe anyone will be able to get over that. But very cool level. Neat seeing all these fan creations. I definitely want to get frustrated at this level.
It's a little bit too long but it's definitely looking good.
“Quick”
Was that a man engine at the halfway point?

Old school cool.
I dont understand how the devs havent made a ton of new ones since this game blew up? I can't imagine it being that hard.
If the game gets a lvl editor you should post this right away. Looks very fun to play
This is insane, what a great level.
It looks incredible, i would love to play that map. Me and my friend also thought about a map with multiple slimy slides with obstacles, with checkpoints between each slides
I find it a little longer than the average map but other than that it seems like a good idea
This is awesome!!
Someone hire this man!
Was that the Trails HD sound effect lol
i really like this and the job is great wit the 3D.  
Maybe a bit too long and the spaces between areas with the columns feel really big and the columns themselfs dont seem to do much, so probably would cut some off, but still a really good interesting idea. I know the up and down platforms are going to be hell, but i love them nontheless.
Really nice concept! I hope this gets put in the game to keep it more fresh and exciting :)
Wow thats amazing. Great job.
I’m already raging at falling off the circles towards the end and it doesn’t even exist.
Ooooh. Fuck those spinning bridges you evil fuck. I hope I can play this.
Oh God a course longer than see saw
I really like it but I think it's too long.
This is too much of a skill level and doesn't involve nearly enough chaos or chance, which is crucial to the spirit of the game.  Would be a fun race but need more whacky chaos.
Too many good ideas/obstacles for one run imo. Enough for two at least. 

Awesome stuff.
Is beautiful, like crash bandicoot in some parts. MEDIATONIC make it official!
I already can hear all the "wooooooo"
it’s.... its....

beautiful
Looks awesome!

The current games feel very boring already to be honest. Barely playing anymore.
Honestly can't understand how they have so few levels
this looks like a hugger’s dream map
Great level. The hacker at the finish line was a nice touch!
This needs to be in the game!
Get it into season 3
I wished the game had a custom map editor but sad they cant because their engine :(
This is some next level shit right here
This as a “First across the finish line wins” finale would be awesome. I’d hate to see the idiots that get stuck on the goddamn seesaws try to negotiate this for an hour.
This looks brutal. Might as well add a pillbox at the top with a mini-gun just mowing down the beans
This. Looks. Hectic. I love it.
this is brilliant and i already hate everybody just looking at the verticle one
This as a finale would be fantastic, amazing work!
Wow! This is actually really good! I honestly hope that this will end up in the game!
I had an idea, what if you could choose your position in the start of the game and if you lose you use the pegs your character falls into and plays Plinko and wherever you land could give you percentage amounts of extra Kudos and maybe even a crown for those who have a hard time getting to the final stage
It looks fantastic! But I think it would need a split into two levels, because it is so long and it could be hard to finish it in time.
This is amazing, but I sadly don’t think that they can add it to the game yet, because of the new season being medieval themed :((
Looks good but towards the end where the orange circles are going up and down, can you make the two blue circles spin
Imagine if we could make our own levels?? Falls guys has so much potential
Madness!
Looks good but way too long
This looks awesome! Great work.
I don't know how rights work on using fan designs for thngs like this, but I hope we see some of these ideas added to the game
Needs more slime.
It's a really long course, but I like that. For a finale lots of opportunity, and for a starter course it will really spread the pack out.
This looks really fun :)
Maye little too long but still gr8
Am I the only one that thinks it looks boring and Easy? The first section is just gate crash lol
wow
I dig it
ID say a bit too long but it Is amazing!
this is the type of levels I wish the game had to begin with. the closest we have now is slime climb...
I love this! Does the dev check in here at all? I hope they see it.
This is dope
That looks miserable. Nice work.
They really do need to make a level editor and have new levels added by the community. If they do that they literally don't have to make maps anymore
Going full circle back to the UT ‘99 BunnyTrack levels
This would be sooo hard but sooooooo fun
That looks like so much fun.
Already better than SeeSaw, Fruit Chute, and all the team games
The part with the boxes that go up and down is both genius and cruel!
This is such a great and expansive idea for a level and I'm not just making up words on my phone waiting for this round of See Saw to end.
This looks like pain
Looks long and hard
You have three solid levels here. That is amazing.
I can’t wait to lose on this level
Hope u/Fallguysjoe sees this
This is amazing ,but I think it is a bit too long
I LOVE this as a concept!
Better two differents using this, this is too long for just one
that's sick! i really like it but maybe a bit shorter.  
man we need more maps. do we have to wait until season 2 now? 😐
Now this is a final I want to see
They need to hire you!! Awesome job!!
Yo this shit finna smash so many keyboards
u/FallGuysJoe
it looks awesome
I can already see the casual gamer saying that is very difficult
Wow seeing your level really make me wanna see a tower level with rising purple! A few place where a mistake send you back a floor max below!
Yo this is too difficult
they should of just used the name "death run" for this game... #cs
Now, this guy. This guy knows how to have fun.
Wipeout + American Ninja Warrior= OP's level
Dang 55 awards I have never gotten one😂
Yes, this is fantastic! More creative and diverse, challenging courses, please and thank you!
I’m not seeing this opinion yet, so here:
Some are saying first level. Some are saying finale. 
As long and difficult as this level would be, why not have a “first and only” round. Start with all 60 and the first one to finish gets the crown, and the rest get eliminated with a higher winnings than a typical elimination.
Too many great elements in a single track, cut it down into 2 tracks and it will be awesome. Sometimes less is more.
Damn man. You got skills! Respect for your work
I love it!
This is incredible
I could easily see this as 2 stages, or take each element and use it for individual levels.  Each idea is amazing, and could make for awesome ideas.
What is the yellow penises for?, they don't seem like they serve any purpose.
Yes
Yooo this could be an awesome starting level or final level, would actually love to play this in game.

An awesome idea i had for the devs would be to have an level tester mode, then in that mode have a featured section for the best levels so people actually would try levels out, and then have ratings so the devs could consider incomplimenting some of the best community created levels
It looks amazing, I would just make yellow posts go up and down too, just a little more craziness on race haha, amazing man, I loved your idea
It looks like a fun map but the developers stayed away from difficult maps due to the game wanting to feel fun, not frustrating for new players. As of right now the hardest map is slime climb, and although it is relatively easy for good players it is extremely difficult for new players. This map I feel like would be difficult for new players to enjoy.
this is amazing! 

it looks a little long though. the yellow pole sections are cute, but not really necessary or providing any sort of real "obstacle", maybe cut out the second grid, maybe only 4 bars are the start instead of 6.

i love the barrels and wish they were already in the game for some level (rollout doesnt count. thats big and survival, not traversal). however, the lower section if you fall off doesnt really provide any disadvantage. maybe make the ramp up slime covered? the verticality from the elevators is fantastic. and since its a slow and "waiting" obstacle, perfect time to jostle and try to push others out! the skill for the treacherous disc jumps is amazing and i love it.
I want to play this
Looks like a living hell, I hope it gets added
Better name would be Rise and Fall to keep with the “Fall” convention
This would be dope
This is actually incredible and I need to play this rn
For when you think that you'd like to be aggravated, but that Slime Climb just isn't pressing your buttons anymore.
that would be a fun final map.
I want to play this so I can yell at my tv and blame children for being better than me
Just add respawning but a storm like thing that forces you to move
wow this is great
This is great! Looks super hard though, but who doesn’t love a challenge. This would be me though...

No one:

Me: ELIMINATED
This is super cool but its a bit on the long side
This is so cool! I'd love to play a level like this!
Really cool idea! But I already struggle with slime climb 😅
This is great work. I would love to race on it.

Tho, 2 small issues that you may or may not adress in further projects: it is about 1/4 - 1/3rd too long compared to other races;  and those moving barrels changing direction very often is probably too hard especially considering lag and wonky physics of FG. 

Again, love the idea.
I love it
This would be epic for a final game
What happens if you get crush by the alternating platforms? I havent played the game yet so i dont know if thats already been answered by another map thats already in play.
Please make this happen!! We need more levels like this
Actually looks fun af
No slime, I like it :)
Should implement something where you have to grab and climb. I wish there was more that in the game. The Whirlygig, I believe, has that function where you climb up that short wall.  I always thought about having a level of just stairs to climb up by grabbing and climbing lol
This idea is incredible! Now all it needs is a funky name...
Uppvote his post 
I dont care if i get hate i just want to get my friend some uppvotes


[My friend ](https://www.reddit.com/u/ligmaforlife654?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)
Where is big yeetus
you should be hired.
I would never finish this round.
This is amazingly good. It fits so well. I really hope this gets picked up by the devs.
This is an amazing concept. My only criticism is that maybe it's a bit too long. I love every obstacle though and think it could probably just be split into two different courses. Fall guys should hire you as a level concept creator.
I thought the grid was going to be a picture match MID RACE lol.
That's so cool
you know people will be yeeting each other off
It’s freaking Awesome
Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Wow well done, it really captures the fall guys feel.
Wow! The aesthetic is done very accurately to the T! Props to you 👏 

I really hope someone from Mediatonic sees this and takes it into consideration.
Just me or does it seem long? Also I would make those rolls bar things slower, as to make it faster to use those than to just skip em and go down directly.
I think the circle bit at the end looks terrifying and hard. But looks very fun overall.
Looks fun af
Dude, MediaTonic needs to see this
I think the very last up hill portion is overkill.
You made slime climb your bitch!
This is way better than the current crown race
We need this
They should hire you
#PROPS!#
That part with the blue and orange beams would be hell, amazing design though
i've been saying this since the start- they need to put in a level editor to allow community created content, otherwise the game will get stale
This NEEDS to be in game. But I would make that ladder part thing a bit faster
What an amazing design! I hope you get a job out of this.
\*Insert Shia Labeouf slow clap gif
“Best burgers in town” on a hotdog banner at the end lol
A loooooong one!  Man, that could be so much fun!  :)
Powerful work, you should get paid next time.
Dope!
why are u so talented!!!
If this doesn't get in the game. I have no idea how many up votes you will need then.
This looks almost like it’s from the game I was co fused for a second
yes
That's looks like a finales race
Grat design! I just feel that you have like at leats 3 maps in this one. You have to know tjat the developers have to stall content to make people buy kudos
When i saw those bars raise at the beginning I thought, 'Hey thats a cool new obstacle,' and then I got to the alternating platform wall and I truly could not imagine a more diabolical obstacle. I can only imagine the pushing and shoving that would go on there. I love it, well done!
"a quick design".
Cut this in half, you have 2 fantastic maps there at least!
Amazing design! My only recommendation is on the rotating log part early on, there's no incentive to try and stay on. It's easier it seem to just fall off and run up so you don't waste time. Incentivize trying to stay in the rotating cogs and you've got the best level in the game!
Lovely level design
It looks to me like the bottom route under the little rollout section would be quicker than the top route. Maybe make them backtrack if they fall?
Now that's some next level (no pun intended) shit. Incredible job OP.
Fall guys should add a level editor
Love it, especially the rotating cylinders! Would be my second favorite level after slime climb.

One suggestion I have is to make the squares in the grid area intermittently drop/disappear following a short color change or rumble warning.
This might be harder than slime climb 😧
u/Fallguysjoe
At about 12 seconds in, is that bean okay?
Only suggestion, add slime to end hill to give meaning to the bumper pillars otherwise outstanding!!
I loved it!

I just don't get the first part. I dont see how this is an obstacle. Seems like you simply walk and that is.
No way anyone is able to walk across the sectional opposite spinning rollers. Not at that speed at least. Otherwise looks like a lot of fun.
Oh my God, yes yes yes. Please please please u/fallguysjoe.
The yellow polls at the end should slide back and fourth.
I love that section with the elevators. The only thing I don't like are the rollers. There's very little penalty for falling off of them.
It looks cool but it kind of seems too long.
Hopefully devs see this and acknowledge it because this would be awesome!
Wow, its not so short and its just awesome, incredible!
I think it is too hard to say how good it would play without testing it but you definitely have some great ideas in there.  I especially like the idea of the staged elevator and the floating platforms.
Looks so damn dope
Ha very cool. Funny though how there’s a thousand signifiers for which way to go when it’s literally a straight line in the sky
This looks really fun.
The end part gives me mario party vibes.
“quick design” how long this actually take you? its sick
I think it looks awesome, but man thats kike 2 levels in one. Its super long.
Ok how do we send it to the dev team?  This looks intense!
I like the stuff with the rising bars. Seems like a natural progression from what Gate Crash was doing. The rising and lowering platforms remind me of Seesaw, but without having to account for the other players' stupidity.
Bravo
Idea: the middle section with the grid, make only some bars move up and down, like a random maze!
For the classic fall guys format this are 3 levels, the fences going up and down, the wall with moving platforms, and the floating circle platforms, this are great ideas
Bro do you have any idea how good of a level that would be? You did amazing
Way too complicated
###testing
👏make👏this👏a👏level👏
Incredible idea, there's a discord where you can submit ideas I think...  You should do that
Fall guys please make this
This should be added next season definitely
I love the little elevator idea
Looks really hard
Brilliant!
This is awesome
Seems a little long but looks really cool! Hope something like this gets put into the game!
If only FG had any race that was this long it would keep my attention far longer. Here’s hoping season 2 brings welcomed change.
Hey look, a cheaters just waiting at the end for some poor sap to catch up
Theyll see this and instead add more tail tag levels
This is really cool but goddamn I can just imagine raging at the ending part
We need more levels of attrition a la slime climb.



Also, I vote for a more brutal Roll Out v2.0 with giant gaps in the floor and slime pits scattered about.
I want it so bad.
I want to play this so bad
I wish they made some sort of game that was player controlled where we could shoot giant balls “wink” at eachother or something along the lines of that.
Long runs for the finale would be so incredible, and this design is amazing to see.
This would be an amazing first or final level
If you can do this why not make a game! I love this and want to play it!!
I want to play this 😍
Genius
Man I forgot how relented some people were in trials level creator. I remember in Evolution someone actually made a version of the Slender Man game
Looks good, it should be a 2nd round race level
I dont play but that looks like a great level
This looks amazing, but also massive. Looks like it could almost be 2 levels
I don’t play the game, how would it handle a player getting squashed under the bar at the start?
Yeah just a ‘quick’ design
10/10 would fall off of it.
Definitely good for beginning level shoul either add slime or balls shooting out on the last stretch to Finish line very well made
Holy crap this looks rlly good! It would be great as a final
u/redditdownloader
I like it, but holy S H I T is it a gauntlet and a half
Please pay this man and make this level Mediatonic
This is why we should have a community tab for pc & map editor which could be used for submissions to be bug fixed and integrated into the full game for ps4 aswell. Like we help build the future seasons (rounds and skins) they made the skin blank public so we could make skins so why not take people's work with credit to them 
A good example of this suggestion is cs: go
The floating platforms and the weird elevator things look like they will be so painful to get through when 50+ players are scrambling to get onto them.
This looks really good, but imagine 20-30 people at the wall part. Has to be a later map or even a final.
Freaking awesome
Guys do be fallin doe 😳
It’s amazing!
You better be careful, you might catch a decent paying job pulling this kind of shit.
You can smell the toxicity of this map by seeing it
This looks fantastic hopefully the devs see this
[removed]
I'd prefer it as a starting level. There'd be so much chaos especially at those lifts where you could throw people off.
    Why not both
        Both is good
        Agreed, I feel like every level should hve the option of being a final level.
            Imagine high intensity last man standing for a fruit matching game!
                Just have more fruit every round. Eventually each tile will be a different fruit
                    Oh no. 16 fruit would be tough to memorize. It would probably result in a lot of draws
                        That'll only be the last round. Doubt most people will make it that far

On the later rounds, you'll have to take a gamble with what fruits to memorize. You won't be able to do all of them, but maybe you get lucky and memorize the right one? 

If you don't get the right one, you can always go back to the strategy of following everyone else
            No, both as in first *AND* last. 60 player race to the crown.
                That would be fun.  I thought that’s how the game was before I played it, one race, one winner.
                In that case the race shouldn't be called up and down it should be alpha and omega
        Bro slime climb for the final would be amazing
            Then it becomes a competition only for those who know the shortcuts especially the hammer skip.
And this is why this game needs a map editor with a voting system. Good made maps will be voted by the community and introduced into the official map pool.

Edited i think
    A map editor would be great for the lifespan of the game, and could even be used for competitions to turn some into offical maps!
    You must be hungry.
        -_- i need to change my phone
    A map editor would be amazing.  Anything that helps the community do the dev's work for them should be a no brainer.
        I fully agree in the way that they could have anyone make a map and then every week or month the community could vote out if 5 maps or so for what one can be included in the game!
    Remindme! 1 year

If this isn't a thing by then I'll eat a gummy worm
Yep this would be so much better as a finale than Royal Fumble or Fall Mountain.  IMO  Fall Mountain is too short and Royal Fumble is stupid.
    You mean you don’t love holding the tail for 1:26 for a Dino to just walk up and steal it from you last second?
        Your mistake is playing at all for the first minute and 10 seconds, just find a nice spot and emote until its game time. Chances of winning are the same, but losing stings less.
        What’s this walk up bullshit? They steal it from 10 meters away and then I run into them with my grabby hands out and nothing happens, because I don’t deserve a tail buttplug.
        [deleted]
            My favorite was when I held the tail for the entire round and as soon as the timer hit zero because a man standing near me had his arms out and I was forced to stop they got the tail and won.

I just sat there for a moment like  "Yes this was fair and I did not hate it."
                [deleted]
                    I was in game development and I know it's hard once online play becomes a thing so I'm trying to be patient but this stuff happens a lot and I find myself being pushed away from playing more y'know?
    Royal Fumble!? Wow that's a final I haven't played in a while. Is that still in the pool?
        Hopefully not once season 2 comes out
    You should see Game Theorys new video. He took a pill and tail tag was literally voted as the worst game. I think it was like 45% of the votes
I would love fall mountain as a 1st round map
    Yes
I disagree. The final race should be pretty short, with obstacles that have a good chance of tripping you up even with a small density of people. The way this map, and most of the other early race maps that this one is trying to be like are designed is to take full advantage of a big mob of people getting in each other’s way more than the actual obstacles do. 

This looks like it was made to capitalize on the chaos of 60 people trying to race to the finish and getting in each other’s way. Especially the elevator part. If there were only 10 or so people every obstacle would be way too easy to avoid and it would have an even bigger problem of “whoever starts in front is guaranteed to win”
    yes, this map works better as a starter, but its still better as a finale than fall mountain. there just isnt ENOUGH obstacles to trip people up on fall mountain. its too common to just hold forward and make it through cleanly with minimal sidestepping, and you're STILL neck and neck with somebody else. there isnt enough chance for people to catch up. there isnt enough chance for leaders to flub something. one minor inconvenience and you're basically fucked. with this stage, there is still a lot of precision jumping necessary. thats a lot of chances for leaders to screw up.
Team this is my problem with most of the finals, one mistake and you have most likely lost. Would be fun with some longer obstacle courses where you can actually make a comeback.
    Except people will get really good at this map and it will turn out 1 mistake means you lose on this one, too.
        Unless they manage to make it a bit randomized which obstacles are spawned each round. Would be awesome if they added some randomized levels.
I think the problem with this being a finale is that there are a lot of places where you can just fall into the void.
    It’s a race, but as a finale. There would be checkpoints along the way just like any other race map.
u/MediaTonicGames ?
    u/fallguysjoe
        u/cottoneyejoe 

Where did you come from? Where did you go?
Is this a Norbert Moses I see??
I like it a lot but It's a little long. If you cut out the first and third section, I think it'd work much better as a finale game.

I *do* like the idea of longer, more difficult races, though. 

The unfortunate thing is that the more difficult a map is, the more the skill gap increases and you might lose the immense amount of casual players since it'd feel like they have even less of a chance when pros start making it to the end of maps when they're only halfway through.
    I like that it's longer for a finale. I think Fall Guy Mountain is the worst ending because of how short it is. You make one mistake or get hit by an RNG ball and it's over.
        What does RNG stand for sorry

Edit research still pending but it may, maaay mean Random number generator. Lol seriously though thanks for the answers!
            Random number generator, it just means it’s a random event like in what direction is the ball going to spawn
            So far 6 people answered and I fear it might not be enough.  
So I would also like to tell you it stands for Random Number Generator.
                Oh look 12 of the same answer i better get in there and make sure they saw it!
            Random Number Generation, i.e the balls aren’t spit out based on a pattern or anything. Instead numbers are generated randomly in the background and when a certain value is reached, a ball spits out.
            It means Nandom Gumber Renerator, of course.
            RNG itself stands for Random Number Generator, but the term is used for elements in games which are determined by chance i.e. the random nature in which the balls roll down the hill
            Random number generation
            Random Number Generator - basically randomness over skill
    I hate this way of thinking. Long levels are sooo much more fun. 

Hit parade: oh suddenly its over as all 40 people cross at once...

See Saw: long time to complete, you can mess up and be ok, feels like an actual competition
    They should add a “ranked” with more difficult maps maybe even a squad playlist with only team based maps for u and your buddies
    This is a problem that’s already happening. The “skilled” people are outpacing the casual players and I don’t like it. They need to figure out a way to even the playing field like it was when it first came out.
        It's the multiplayer curse, every game is afflicted. Go try Tetris 99 nowadays.
            Couldn't win even in the beginning
        Lol that’s pretty much impossible to do without making the game trash. Developers have been trying to do it the past 10 years
        People getting better at anything is not a problem, it's human nature at it's core. It's happened in every game ever made and will happen in every game ever created in the future. People playing the same game repeatedly and never improving is a problem.
        I know exactly what you mean and that first 2 weeks was incredible before people learned the Meta routes. The game works best when it combines luck and skills fairly. However I cant even begin to imagine how hard that is to achieve.
Why would you lie in the first place????
Yep that's the real centre piece of this level, I can just imagine so much chaos and hilarious shithousery in those mini elevators
    Those mini elevators already made me sick with tears of frustration lol
    Shithousery is one of my favourite words and so rarely seen on Reddit.
Its a great idea but how would you deal with a player getting pinched between two platforms? eject them off the lift?
    That's a possibility, or just not have them connect and spaced slightly further above and below so you have to jump from one to the next
    They could just keep it simple, player gets cut in half and eliminated.
*It was* **probably** *their first time.*
    They just happen to be wearing a ninja suit that costs ten crowns or whatever
You could split this into three parts and each one would be a solid level!
uphill slimb climb maybe.. with hammers
Came here to say this. The roller part would be faster for people who just jump down and avoid it.
who's Gerald? Am I missing something here?
Thank you! I made it using in-game editor of Trials Rising. Yes, a motorcycle game :D
    How did you get it to look so close to the fall guys style? Is the editor just that versatile, or did you have to import stuff into it?
        All items are made in the editor. It's amazingly versatile and powerful editor although it takes some time to get used to :)
            Wow! I'll have to check it out! I guess we have to make do until they see fit to give us an official editor.

Anyway, brilliantly done! Hopefully this gets all the recognition it deserves.
            We need to get you creating in Dreams on PS4. This is pretty cool and your Trials tracks are always great. You'll feel right at home in Dreams. It has a lot of similarities to the Trials editor.
            YOU’RE an amazingly versatile and powerful editor :)
    You would be doing the world a favor if you learned Unity. Seeing this piece of macgyvered motorcycle game art makes me think you would build something amazing given real tools :)
Thank you! I plan on making more, it was a fun project :)
    Also, I really hope that they add a level editor eventually. I think you would be able to make amazing levels!
The center circles should have pink sludge on them!
How do you make your text thicc?
    Put a " # " sign in front of the object you want enlarged/bolded. It'll make everything connected to it in that sentence or paragraph bigger and bolder. The more "# " signs you put the smaller the text'll be; I think 3 or 4 is the maximum effect.
 
- #SHAZAM

For just bold text put " ** your subject in between the asterisks ** " 

- **A-Prestamundo**
        #*Ñ*
Did you just make up a new word?
Might be too hardcore as a starting round, maybe 2nd/3rd but the bottomless jumps at the end might make this too extreme for anything but a finale
    I dont understand, there are falls in see saw and whirly-do. Why is that bad for starting level?
        I guess if there's a checkpoint right before the falls then you're right it's not an issue.
Well that’s the thing, skilled players should be able to exploit stuff like that. Same thing with the shortcuts in Slime Climb
I would honestly gild the fuck outta OP if I didn’t live off of food stamps
That's  what seperates Fall Guys from Decending Gentlemen.
    Not if hitting the bars bounce you around covered in slime!
And? That seems like a viable option
I feel like that's the intention. Try to run on a rounded bar, potentially falling and losing more time, or just waiting, which is also losing time.
I can already see me and the boys camping those last orange circles and eliminating everyone
My thoughts exactly. This, Whirlygig, and Slime Clime make great 1st and 2nd round games, especially since chaos is a ladder
Why not both
    Both is good
    Agreed, I feel like every level should hve the option of being a final level.
        Imagine high intensity last man standing for a fruit matching game!
            Just have more fruit every round. Eventually each tile will be a different fruit
                Oh no. 16 fruit would be tough to memorize. It would probably result in a lot of draws
                    That'll only be the last round. Doubt most people will make it that far

        Random Number Generation, i.e the balls aren’t spit out based on a pattern or anything. Instead numbers are generated randomly in the background and when a certain value is reached, a ball spits out.
        It means Nandom Gumber Renerator, of course.
        RNG itself stands for Random Number Generator, but the term is used for elements in games which are determined by chance i.e. the random nature in which the balls roll down the hill
        Random number generation
        Random Number Generator - basically randomness over skill
I hate this way of thinking. Long levels are sooo much more fun. 

Hit parade: oh suddenly its over as all 40 people cross at once...

See Saw: long time to complete, you can mess up and be ok, feels like an actual competition
They should add a “ranked” with more difficult maps maybe even a squad playlist with only team based maps for u and your buddies
This is a problem that’s already happening. The “skilled” people are outpacing the casual players and I don’t like it. They need to figure out a way to even the playing field like it was when it first came out.
    It's the multiplayer curse, every game is afflicted. Go try Tetris 99 nowadays.
        Couldn't win even in the beginning
    Lol that’s pretty much impossible to do without making the game trash. Developers have been trying to do it the past 10 years
    People getting better at anything is not a problem, it's human nature at it's core. It's happened in every game ever made and will happen in every game ever created in the future. People playing the same game repeatedly and never improving is a problem.
    I know exactly what you mean and that first 2 weeks was incredible before people learned the Meta routes. The game works best when it combines luck and skills fairly. However I cant even begin to imagine how hard that is to achieve.
Those mini elevators already made me sick with tears of frustration lol
Shithousery is one of my favourite words and so rarely seen on Reddit.
That's a possibility, or just not have them connect and spaced slightly further above and below so you have to jump from one to the next
They could just keep it simple, player gets cut in half and eliminated.
They just happen to be wearing a ninja suit that costs ten crowns or whatever
How did you get it to look so close to the fall guys style? Is the editor just that versatile, or did you have to import stuff into it?
    All items are made in the editor. It's amazingly versatile and powerful editor although it takes some time to get used to :)
        Wow! I'll have to check it out! I guess we have to make do until they see fit to give us an official editor.

Anyway, brilliantly done! Hopefully this gets all the recognition it deserves.
        We need to get you creating in Dreams on PS4. This is pretty cool and your Trials tracks are always great. You'll feel right at home in Dreams. It has a lot of similarities to the Trials editor.
        YOU’RE an amazingly versatile and powerful editor :)
You would be doing the world a favor if you learned Unity. Seeing this piece of macgyvered motorcycle game art makes me think you would build something amazing given real tools :)
Also, I really hope that they add a level editor eventually. I think you would be able to make amazing levels!
Put a " # " sign in front of the object you want enlarged/bolded. It'll make everything connected to it in that sentence or paragraph bigger and bolder. The more "# " signs you put the smaller the text'll be; I think 3 or 4 is the maximum effect.
 
- #SHAZAM

For just bold text put " ** your subject in between the asterisks ** " 

- **A-Prestamundo**

I dont understand, there are falls in see saw and whirly-do. Why is that bad for starting level?
    I guess if there's a checkpoint right before the falls then you're right it's not an issue.
Not if hitting the bars bounce you around covered in slime!
Both is good
Agreed, I feel like every level should hve the option of being a final level.
    Imagine high intensity last man standing for a fruit matching game!
        Just have more fruit every round. Eventually each tile will be a different fruit
            Oh no. 16 fruit would be tough to memorize. It would probably result in a lot of draws
                That'll only be the last round. Doubt most people will make it that far

On the later rounds, you'll have to take a gamble with what fruits to memorize. You won't be able to do all of them, but maybe you get lucky and memorize the right one? 

If you don't get the right one, you can always go back to the strategy of following everyone else
    No, both as in first *AND* last. 60 player race to the crown.
        That would be fun.  I thought that’s how the game was before I played it, one race, one winner.
        In that case the race shouldn't be called up and down it should be alpha and omega
Bro slime climb for the final would be amazing
    Then it becomes a competition only for those who know the shortcuts especially the hammer skip.
-_- i need to change my phone
I fully agree in the way that they could have anyone make a map and then every week or month the community could vote out if 5 maps or so for what one can be included in the game!
Your mistake is playing at all for the first minute and 10 seconds, just find a nice spot and emote until its game time. Chances of winning are the same, but losing stings less.
What’s this walk up bullshit? They steal it from 10 meters away and then I run into them with my grabby hands out and nothing happens, because I don’t deserve a tail buttplug.
[deleted]
    My favorite was when I held the tail for the entire round and as soon as the timer hit zero because a man standing near me had his arms out and I was forced to stop they got the tail and won.

I just sat there for a moment like  "Yes this was fair and I did not hate it."

            I was in game development and I know it's hard once online play becomes a thing so I'm trying to be patient but this stuff happens a lot and I find myself being pushed away from playing more y'know?
Hopefully not once season 2 comes out
Unless they manage to make it a bit randomized which obstacles are spawned each round. Would be awesome if they added some randomized levels.

Where did you come from? Where did you go?
What does RNG stand for sorry

Edit research still pending but it may, maaay mean Random number generator. Lol seriously though thanks for the answers!
    Random number generator, it just means it’s a random event like in what direction is the ball going to spawn
    So far 6 people answered and I fear it might not be enough.
