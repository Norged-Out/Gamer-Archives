[[Making a meme from every mission in Red Dead 2 Day 2]]





This is very strong work.
    Thank you! :D
I will watch your career with great interest
    Me too
    Beat me to it.
Itll honestly bring back memories of the game as well, good work
    It's already bringing back pretty vivid memories of the story for myself actually! And thanks bud! :D
Hopefully you end up this series with the most upvotes in this sub and I will proudly say I've been here since the beginning
    I will most certainly appreciate if you follow along this journey with me all the way through! And that would me crazy, if I got the most upvoted post on this sub I mean.
Like it, keep it up!
    Thanks bud!
I love how dramatic John is during this mission. He just keeps swooning back and going, "I don't feel so good" and Arthur is just all, will you stfu back there, you're fine.
    "You know, we're gonna need to come up with a better story for that scar."

"So, freezing, bleeding, starving, damn near getting eaten to death, ain't good enough for you?!"
        True.
Don't mind me, just proving this is my OC :)

It might be OC, it might not. Things such as JPEG artifacts and cropping may impact the results.

Well done sir
    Thanks man!
WOW making a meme from every mission!? Good luck but I can already tell it's going great
    Yep! Sure am :)

Thank you friend! The support has been crazy, and I'm only on day two!
MORE!!!!
    There will be more tomorrow :)

[Also, the "MORE!!!!" made me think of this.](https://youtu.be/7NyN8ikEGio)
        I like how you think
Yes please continue this, I like this
    Will do chief!
And if that "dog" is more like a massive lion, you die in a few minutes instead.
I can already hear that cool song playing as the wolves attack üëå
    [It is a pretty cool one ngl! ](https://youtu.be/NFywschbMUU)
I knew a lady who came from Duluth
She got bit by a dog with a rabid tooth
She went to her grave just a little too soon
Flew away howling on the yellow moon
    Where do bad folks go when they die?
Make memes out of Undead Nightmare so that they will make undead nightmare two :)
    When we get around to rdr1, I will!
        I love your commitment!
        Mooooreee!!!
Must have been a small boi
What mom says it like that? ‚ÄúOh you‚Äôll be fine baby, here some disinfectant and a bandaid.‚Äù

It‚Äôs usually a way bigger deal than that
    Mine, but without the ‚Äúbaby‚Äù part. I literally got *hit by a car* while riding my bike when I was around 15 years old... walked my broken bike and busted knee back home, and told my mom what happened. Her reaction? ‚ÄúYou can still walk, it seems. The doctor is less than a mile away, so walk yourself there if you need to.‚Äù

And I‚Äôm a girl/woman, btw. So it‚Äôs not like she was thinking ‚Äúboys have to be strong.‚Äù But she didn‚Äôt raise any pussies, male or female! That‚Äôs for sure.
    My mom trys to stay calm in those situations and soothe me. I always freaked out when she made a big deal out of me getting hurt, so she learned to just be calm and gentle as it was what worked best for me :)
        My mom freaked out and then said ‚Äúif this dog acts up like this again he‚Äôs gone‚Äù I hated that dog because he was mean and would bite me a lot and then started to bite me just because I wouldn‚Äôt pet him because I was scared then she said that and he bit me bad three more times each time she said the same thing....
    To be fair, rabies is terrifying. If you do get bit by an unknown dog, go to the hospital.
    Yeah, I thought the same thing - usually the mother is the one freaking out like the kid is gonna die, and the father is the one playing it down like it‚Äôs just a scratch, stop crying. 

It‚Äôs still a really cool meme though
You are on your way to becoming a legend.
    I hope so!
Instantly followed to see more
    Thanks man! :D
This is brilliant!
    Glad to hear you think so!
God I'm interested with how this will go
Love it! Keep em' coming!
    Will do!
Amazing idea and amazing meme. This one is so funny to me for some reason lol
    What makes it so funny to me is being able to hear Arthur's voice in my head!
Started following you just for this experience. üòÅ
    Thank you pardner! ü§†
Ah, a good meme once in a while :D
Great! Will you also use secondary missions?
    I am unsure at the moment, I'll burn that bridge when I get there! Maybe I'll ask people if I should do that.
Top notch memeing sir, carry on.
Oh my god... Good luck man!
    Thank you! I'll need it :)
God I hated feeling like I was walking in wet cement in that damn snow.
This is some dedication! Considering how many good lines they're in some of the missions this should be exciting
    I think it will be as well!
You‚Äôre doing god‚Äôs work here.
    Hah! I'm glad you appreciate it :D
I csnt wait to see more
    And you will! Tommorow, same time :)
I love this idea. Consider yourself followed.
    I appreciate it friend!
‚ÄúOh...Looks like we‚Äôll have to cut it off.‚Äù
    *Various unspeakable words thrown in the fathers general direction by the mother*
It's more complicated.
This is awesome! So keen for more!!
    And you'll get more tomorrow! :D
Fantastic meme pardner
    Thanks pardner! :D
This is a good one
    "I dont doubt it"
        You‚Äôve got a follow cause I don‚Äôt want to miss any
            Thanks pardner! ü§†
Or it would be "you need a better story for that scar"
    Damn! That could have worked too.
        You should make it!
            Naw man, you came up with the idea. You should make that one :)
                I simply have no idea how to make memes so I give you highest honour to make the meme and leave no credit to me as your post inspired my idea!
Going to follow you just for these
    Seems like a lot of folks are doing that!
Oh I'm looking forward to this series
This is one of those ‚Äúwhy didn‚Äôt I think of that‚Äù posts. Good on you lmao I‚Äôm excited to see where this goes!
Oh damn, we will watch your career with great interest!
The whole rdr2 community will watch your career with great interest
Wow literally saw this post with 0 upvotes and 0 comments and came back to see it one of the most popular posts the next day! I‚Äôm so proud to have been the first upvoter of this fantastic meme!
This is perfect
Love too see this keep going. Did you get the idea from the Spider-Man guy doing it?
    Nope! But I do respect him for the dedication. Creating a meme from *every line* in anything sounds like hell.
I saw this yesterday but didn‚Äôt quite remember that it was yesterday. Later that day I restarted Red Dead 2 because I took too long of a break and wanted a fresh start. I was playing and this part came up and I remembered seeing it sometime in a meme (not realizing it was same day) and was super pumped that I was playing a meme haha. I just saw the day 3 post a few mins ago and that prompted me to look at your posts where I found the origin of my ‚ÄúI‚Äôm playing meme‚Äù thought. Anyways, I like your mission, and good luck!
I just restarted my story mode. Might be my 3rd or 4th playthrough and still running into things I‚Äôve never seen and the dialogue always surprises me and makes me laugh. Played poker w Pearson, I bet like 20 cents and he says ‚Äúis that the allowance from your mama?‚Äù didn‚Äôt expect that from him, made me laugh.
My dad's the same. He just wants me to be a strong boah.
Nice
When I got my lip ripped apart by my dog, it was actually my mom screaming and my dad was the one patting my back.
Antiseptic not disinfectant but good job.
[deleted]
    It is mine, I've posted it on multiple subs mate. Look at my profile.
Dog bites rarely lead to further problems unless the dog is sick because their saliva naturally contains antibacterial agents.
Nicely done. I just restarted the story last night so you posted this at the perfect time for me.
My dad would probably cook the dog, tbh.
Hmmm.

Change the mom's to panicking over whether she should call 911 or rush me to the ER herself to save me the blood loss, and you'll have my parents exactly!
Always check for rabies too. Tetanus as well if youre not vaccined against either
Once I called my dad telling him I was afraid I‚Äôd failed an exam in med school and he then told me a story in great detail about how a girl he knew while he was in med school killed herself after she failed a final.
are you the same dude,who makes these prequel memes from every line?
    No, I am not.
I love dad jokes
Great line
I scratched myself on a rusty nail as a kid while playing outside and my mom told me I had days to live because my jaw would lock up and I would starve to death. I was young and believed her and cried so hard I almost puked.
Lucky we don't have rabies here in the UK. Or sky high medical bills in case someone somehow did get Rabies here. Fortunately fully curable.
I just restarted the game for my 100% playthrough and I literally just finished chapter 1. Brings back good memories
As someone who‚Äôs wearing gauze from a dog bite that happened literally yesterday, I give you my biggest upvote
boring
I knew a feller, got lumbago, died an hour later
Arthur in big smoke voice - All you had to do was scout the damn trail ahed john.
If i got bit by a dog I wouldn‚Äôt care about myself, poor dog that won‚Äôt have the opportunity to improve will be put down
Reminds me of this classic
https://youtu.be/CPrNLm9nR3A
Reminds me of that Mafia 2 scene.

Joe: Shhhhh, you need to be quiet, conserve your strength. I saw it in a movie once.

Henry: Yeah? And what happened to the guy in the movie?

Joe: He... died...

Henry: *annoyed grunt*
I literally lol'd. Good job btw. I'm on another playthrough as well.
I have some gODdamned faith in you, OP.
I know someone like this.
I never noticed the first mission starts with the 2 people who had Arthur‚Äôs back until the end
Man I miss Arthur.
noooo

    Javier says a wolf bite is like a dog bite, that‚Äôs why John says this.
[deleted]
    Yeah, I don't really care.
        [deleted]
            Well not really. I'm not going to overuse them. In fact, this is about the only scenario I could see myself using them in, I just don't feel like caving to the reddit hivemind is all :)
                Good on you. Emojis are fine. It's the people who spam 37 crying laughing emojis that get annoying. I sincerely doubt anyone is mad about your single heart emoji LOL. Nice meme brother.
                    That's about where I stand on it as well! And yeah, I don't the single heart emoji ruffled any feathers. Also, thank you man!
                Cool, and I almost forgot to say nice meme
                    Thanks man! :D
    Says who? r/dankmemes?
        Bro, we all know that r/dankmemes is the pinnacle of human knowledge.
    I also don't like emojis, but I respect people who like it so I keep quiet
    No
    Hey can I make another suggestion shut the absolute fuck up
I lol:ed. üòÇ
Finally the hero we all been waiting for lol
HAHAHA!!!!!   That‚Äôs great. Love it.
Oh man, I will watch your carreer with great interest! Can't wait to see what you'll come up with for Blood Feud, Modern and Ancient, That's Murfree Coutnty and Revenge is a Dish best eaten, my favorite missions!
I got bit by my friends girlfriends dog today and I explained this part to him and saw this like an hour later. I showed him the meme and he says my phone's tapped.
This might be my favorite John moment in Red Dead 2
Anyway but some dirt on it.
Trueeee
Lol
Thank you! :D
Me too
Beat me to it.
