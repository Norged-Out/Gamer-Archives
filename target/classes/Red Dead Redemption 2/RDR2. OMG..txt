[[RDR2. OMG.]]





Good to see she hasn't let it faze her. She's a strong frontier woman.
    “Man, I tell you what women these days talk bout them mannies and pedes, and having their lattes with that pumpkin spice and talkin about her needs.”
        I read that in bill cosby's voice for some reason.
            [I had this guy in mind.](https://youtu.be/C-_PG-rYyHk)
    Mary's built different!!!! The original girlboss
This is the best cutscene glitch I’ve ever seen
    holding the suitcase with no arm was *chiefs kiss*
        It was the exploding out the window made it for me
            “Jamie!”
Boom.
                Jamie wants big boom.
                I played that part a few times over, it sounded, to me, like an atomic fart! Have me a good ol chuckle
            Idk why but the smoke steaming off of her body during that first outdoor shot while walking to the train really did it for me. Something so simply just made me lose it.
                The smoke was bellowing right from her arm socket like an exhaust pipe 😂
            Also the stick of dynamite rocketing into the shot just as the cutscene starts
        Yeah she really VeggieTaled the heck out of that suitcase.
        Your typo reminds me of [this Snickers ad](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSAXLayoMKI).
            Great googly moogly.
        Chief's?
    yeah this one’s up there lol
    I need to know which other cut scenes I can do this for
        There are a bunch of clips of people ordering a deluxe bath for Arthur and then lighting the room on fire right before the cutscene begins and the lady enters the room, usually to then catch on fire herself. The first one of those that I saw back in 2018 is what originally inspired me to buy RDR2 lmao
            Ya got some links to clips? I tried to search but couldn’t find any. I need a few giggles today because I’m almost at the end of chapter 6 🥲
                Yeah here's a couple!

Good luck today!!
                    Oh man, that delayed "So how's it going?" fucking *killed* me.

                            Just another day on the job
    Gonna be a bit pedantic, but this isn’t a glitch. A glitch is when the code screws up, the loading of a texture times out, an object clips through the floor, that sort of thing. Everything in this cutscene is working as intended; even the suitcase behaved according to its set animation.
        ratio
            Ratio would be if my comment had accrued more upvotes than the previous, which it hasn’t.

While we’re on internet terminology, look up “necro”.
                bro is the epitome of a reddit user
    I liked when it seemed like Mary was saying “thank you” for Arthur setting her on fire
Mary Limpin’
    Mary Leakin
        Mary ghost armin
    Mary Zombie
My favorite, a Bloody Mary.
The way she flew out the window
    I’m dying!! The comedic timing is perfect 

“Jamie!”

BOOM
        *becomes burn victim* "good to see you Mary"
If you didn't complete the second mission then Arthur probably thought she looked like that for the rest of her life
bro threw dynamite at mary then said “OMG” when she blew up
    My... le bomb...
*It's good to see you, Mary.* 

I really felt these last words and most especially, when Arthur touched Mary's "hand" for the last time.
    This is the only good way to see Mary
I'm so ashamed I'm laughing at that 🤣
This is fucking hilarious man.
Will she still look like this when you meet her again?
    Probably not.  I set John on fire to get his pistol, and he burned to a crisp and _died_.  Came back to camp later and he was fine.
        Just like in real life.
            But yet the son of a bitch can’t swim worth a damn
            *Westworld theme plays*
        Truly an undead nightmare
        Can you actually get his pistol like that? Lol
            You can get _2_ of his pistols in Chapter 2.  It’s not that hard either!

[Here’s how!](https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/John%27s_Cattleman_Revolver#:~:text=John's%20Cattleman%20Revolver%20can%20be,and%20lead%20him%20to%20John)
                That’s sick! Thanks for the info cowpoke!
                    You bet, mister!
    Quite curious...
She's off to start Silent Hill
    Best comment of the day  🔥  (its only 9 a.m. my time but I can still say this with confidence)
    Really reminded me of Fallout ghouls tbh, lol.
Looks like she’s a witch after all.
Tis but a flesh wound!
Smokin'
The best part was when she blew out the window LOL
PHANTOM LIMB! Watch out Brock!!!
    Amazing, my favorite comment by far
I shouldn't have watched this well taking a piss 🤣.
    lmao the walls are wet probably
She kinda looks like Anakin after he got burned up on Mustafar lmao
    I HATE YOU!
I love the comedic timing

Mary: Jamie!

Ka-Boom right out the window, then continues talking while fully engulfed in flames
    Exactly my fave bit also the sound of the stick getting thrown at her, absolutely amazing
This girl is on faaaaaaiyaaaaaaaaaa
She is smokin hot 🥵
She turned into Darth Vader
She deserved that for leaving my boy Arthur like that. He deserves better!
“Oh you will never change, I know that” - look who’s talking
Lmao this legitimately has me crying, how she's still an armless burn victim through the cutscene.  It works so well because Arthur looks like he can barely look at her. Oh the shame.  I gotta go wipe the tears from my eyes, damn you.
OMG, I guess Tilly, Karen, Abigail, and Susan were right. They all tried to warn Arthur that there was something wrong with Mary.
Hahaha. I watched that three times before I noticed she went out the window.
![gif](giphy|N8HsnD4SkptdK)
That was cool.
Fitting end for that snake. Screw Mary, she's a user.
Tis but a scratch
Mary is a Titan 😂
I wonder if that'll affect her appearance later in the game
walking dead x RDR2
still hurts to watch that moment, even with the missing arm and face
Love how was smoking walking out the door 😂
Am I the only one who finds her some kind of resemblance with Natalie Portman?
What’s the jacket Arthur has in this?
    Zara
Se ya later smooth skin. Also why is no one talking about the Fart with reverb added to the explosion? 🤣
I laughed way too loud at this
I think my favorite part is her smoking on the way to the train. 🤣
Kind of off topic, but I always hated the way Marry talked. The condescending tone in her voice drives me crazy.
OMG hahaha I so have to play this from the start again and be much more evil
It’s 4AM right now and i’m loosing my shit🤣
She literally turned into a ghoul from fallout 💀
Ok, this is it. The single greatest RDR2 video of all time.
I laughed way too hard at her flying out the window and I’m not scared to admit it.
god damnit why cant I se these things before I do the mission so I can attempts it
How do you wonderful people find these things out? Awesome!
I needed this laugh more than you know
I almost lost it at work when she flew out the window
The timing of that explosion was comically impeccable
It’s “Slapstick” comedy.  Slap a stick of dynamite that is.
LOL nice
The worst thing about the game is not being able to kill npcs
Mary, Mary, why ya buggin?
Hahaha awesome
do I hear a fart noise when the explosion happens? lmao this is so goddamn funny
    It’s used in many videos, the original is a guy farting into the speaker intercom at a grocery store
Omg thank you for this, that made me laugh so hard and I really needed it today!
Why did that explosion sound like a fart 😂
This is what happens when the illusion is gone and you see Mary for who she truly is
My boy….my sweet boy
I love how she just shrugged and walked it off.
It's stuff like this that makes my day
“You found me beautiful once” 

Honey.. you got real ugly
Well that's just gone and blown another relationship
😱😵‍💫🥺🤭🍻
lmao
😂
Average chlamydia infection
Gold
Well if that isn't horrifying....
Easily one of the funniest RDR2 clips I’ve ever seen. Well done 👍
What in the walking dead do we have goin' on here? 😂🤣

I’ve seen too many of these. But, what coat is that?? I don’t recall seeing that, or I was just really oblivious.
Lol did she fart? Arthur turned her into Darth Vader
Oh god. Can't stop watching this. When she gets blown out the window....
"Oh Arthur"
Are you fucking kidding me
HAHAHAHAHA💀😭😭🤦‍♀️😂
Nice
All I can think of is CCR: Proud Mary keep on burnin 🔥
Holy crap and she’s actually burned.  I lost it when I saw the dynamite stick flying to where she sat ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|smile).
A+ work, really outstanding. Bravo!!
The fucking arm 😂
What is that coat called?
That's one of the best well thought Dynamites I've ever seen!
Thats one tough biatch
The Phantom Limb!
**Jamie!**  
*(launched out the window)*  
I saw this linked elsewhere on Reddit but have to post my comment here too. I have tears in my eyes from laughing so hard. That’s some Monty Python level absurdity and I love it!
Bwahahahaha
“Jamie!” 💥💥💥
Bro thought she was Stormfront
Every time he says he might run off I wanna shoot him
Her walking to the train still smoking with one arm sent me through the roof 😭
This is fucking hilarious
U are cruel my man. Lol
How
That’s fucking incredible😆😆😆
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAim laughing so hard
She is a true targarian
Just before this video started:

Arthur: "It's over, Mary. I have the high ground!"

Mary: "You underestimate my power."
Arthur may never change, but Mary, you've changed too much.
Send that crispy bitch packing arthur!!!
    Yeah, I ordered her medium rare!
What in the ever loving, Pearl??
The fire between those two is pretty much alive.
That's amazing. Laughed my head off.
"You were the chosen one!"
The smoke haze as she walks to the train. It's perfect...
    The SIZZLING!!
I love these lol
I literally let out a belly deep giggle and my husband thought I was wheezing from allergies. He legit ran in the room thinking I was dying.... dying from laughter. When I showed him he literally went "you and that damn cowboy game"  🤠 😆
This was insane. I remember doing something similar in the graveyard mission
That’ll teach Mary
"Ma'am, no smoking on the train."
🎶This girl is on fiiiiiiiirrrrrrrre🎶
If this is unmodded, that's fking hilarious.
This is so funny. But also, I'm very impressed by the burning animation - the flesh gradually melting off her is so gory and well-done.

(Something something Arthur likes his steak like he likes his women)
holy fuck im cry-laughing at work LMAOOOOO
I was really hoping Jamie would catch fire during their hug
Her arm stump still smoking 😂😂
The timing of the flames going out and the great reveal omg 😭 I’m coughing-laughing
Stormfront??
"Oh, you'll never change..."

The audacity! 🫢
Real face of Mary Linton 😂
AhahahHahaha ok can't stop laughing
This is fucking hilarious
I took entirely too much pleasure in this.
Don't try it Mary, I have the high ground
Dame Mary’s a smoldering red head.
I fucking dyed laughing at this. Thank you.
She deserves it
Stormfront is in Red Dead????!?
She is the drizzling shits. Fire is too good for her  lol
In the name of holy salvation, seek absolution! Repent, brother! Repent!
You were the chosen one! It was said that you would destroy the Sith, not join them. You were to bring balance to the Force, not leave it in darkness! You were my brother Mary! I loved you!
she flew through the window LMAO
You let the intrusive thoughts win. I like the way you operate.
Hmmmm.. crispy! Very crispy Mary!
The way Jamie got that hug in before she combusted
Chuckled the whole time, especially when she used her good arm to hand him the suitcase.
That's a strong love indeed
Holy shit. That’s gold
Ahhh…. The Wild West. Where the men were men and the women were too
The missing arm had me HOWLING. 🤣
girl turned into anakin
Giving off Anakin vibes. She smoking hot when she’s boarding the train lol
Thank you for the makeover, Arthur 😆
Omg what? You did that on purpose
    Saw this on TikTok two days ago. OP is probably just another reposter trying to insinuate that this is their own footage.
The way I am laughing hysterically at this 😂
DAMN i was doing this mission today at the same time you posted it and I didn't even think about doing that wasted mission for me
HAHAH
Bro came back from hell **oh mah gawd**
*Ssssssssssssmokin!*
WIIIIITCH!!!!!!

edit: is it just me or did that explosion sound like a very loose wet one?
Suffragettes be like
Well, now I see why their relationship never worked out.
I love these edits in cutscenes 😂😂😂😂
I appreciate your work
Lol this is amazing
Wow that was crazy lol
Mary was smoking hot!
Yooooo what 😂😂😂
Why does the explosion sound like a fart lmfao
DARTH VADERRRRR
The smoke following her out… 💀😂
Feck well caught horror scene there!
Daaaaaaamn, partner! 😳
This is hysterical.
😂😂😂
Can anybody find a way to make one where Arthur spontaneously combusted with fire like Ghost Rider during the cutscene towards the end where he says to Sadie “Mrs Adler, ride with me!” all badass like?
leave me will ya!
What Jacket are you wearing in this clip?
And now she looks like Alpha from Walking Dead, nice!
here before it gets locked ☝️
Lol
Worth it!
Mu_Duck is a hero to our cause.
The fact that she was still smoking fuxking sent me
Dude thank you for this. I haven’t ever seen one this before. Also, I laughed this hard in quite a while.
SHE FLEW OUT THE BACK WINDOW 😂
Undead Nightmare confirmed?
Mary was a ghost rider for sometime
Amazing
Thanks. I hate it.
Wait. What mission is this? The only Mary missions I did was the one where you go get her brother and the one in Saint Denis when you go to the show..
    This IS the one where you get her brother, that’s why her brother is right there. 👍🏻
        I blame the reefer
You killed marry
    Whatcha talking about? She’s fine. Didn’t you see her get on the train? Only needed one hand from Arthur and she wasn’t really using that
