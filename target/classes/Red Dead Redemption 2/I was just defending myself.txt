[[I was just defending myself]]





Yeah I get this a lot like if you accidentally hit someone on a horse while your on yours
    Just say hi to people in Saint Denis that will smooth things over.
        Exactly! Saint Denis is the best place to farm honour.
            Until the street urchin gets the feds on you for no reason...
                I will never forget my first day in Saint Denis. I was literally a tourist, only taking photos, saying hi to everyone, buying a new suit. Then, I was in the park, minding my own business when suddenly someone started stabbing me. It was the hobo guy and he attacked me right in front of the officer. After a few secs of confusion I tackled him and knocked him out. Then the officer held a gun at me. Long story short, I ran away from the city, taking out every fucking star on my way.
                    That’s insane because I literally threw a tomahawk, in broad daylight, police officer probably ten feet away looking at me, at the dude preaching about eugenics and no one blinked an eye.
                        you can also tie him up and put him on a horse and feed him to gators and won’t lose honor
                            Hold my health tonic I’m starting over part four lmao
                                i personal chose to carry him all the way to a bear spawn in the west grizzlies, let him get yeeted by the bear, get the bear to leave, then took his corpse to the top of hagen and watch him roll down the sheerest cliff i could find

                                    He comes back too
                                I wish you could it’s the best chapter somewhat
                            Can this he done to all preachers? The guy in Strawberry really grinds my gears. Would love to tie him up and feed him to the bears.
                            It doesnt feel as good as doing it to the suffragettes tho
                                We got an edgelord here

                        He's the only civilian NPC that can be killed with no consequences. Maybe the klansmen too but they were in a remote area when I committed that happy little massacre.
                            You don't even need to kill them. The KKK encounters normally end up bad for them anyways on their own.

No joke, if you haven't watched all 4(?) all the way through you need to.
                                I remember the first time I came across a klan meeting, I watched it play out a little then got tired of it and threw dynamite at them and shot the stragglers. I got +20 health exp for every kill too, thing is I couldn't replicate the exp gain after that which is kinda weird. Not sure why I got exp that one time and that time only but I thought it was some kind of reward for killing them? So I just assumed that you were supposed to intervene and kill them yourself.
                                My only regret is that I couldn’t kill more of them
                        You actually don't get any punishment whatsoever for killing him as far as I have heard
                        Justified.
                            PuRe iS bEtTeR
                        when I shot that guy, I got a 5$ bounty for "disturbing the peace"
                            You're supposed to throw a tomahawk, it's quieter.
                                Hey, you can murder him as brutally as you like, but don't make a scene!
                                I've given him both barrels of a double barrel shotgun straight to the head, cop standing nearby and got away with it. Many times.
                                    You obviously use his head as a silencer, thus not disturbing the peace.
                        Yeah, I've disintegrated that racist piece of shit's head many times, had a pleasant conversation with the officer standing 20 feet away, then gone on my merry way saying hi to folks. Never gets any less satisfying.
                            Does he respawn?
                                I hope so. I think he does
                                    Lmao the first time I killed him was so bland? Hopefully I see his dumbfuck face again— already planning a good murder :p
                        If you antagonize the eugenics guy enough he calls you a fool, and you can beat the shit out of him with no consequences, but because he keeps respawning you can keep beating him without saying anything with no consequence, even when a cop is directly next to you
                            Once Arthur goes “I’ll show you a fool!” or whatever it was and he starts to run away, I kited his escape down to the boat docks. He paused a bit when he got to the end of one and I just barreled into him and knocked him off the edge. No tackle or push, just a collision. After he falls in and dies Arthur said “sorry bout that, don’t know what’s gotten into me today”
                        Yeah, the cops turn a blind eye to anything you do to eugenics guy. Which is awesome. Fuck that guy
                        Yeah the cops don't care about that guy. Rockstar did a good with that one. There's always an officer about 20 feet away from him, and I always beat the shit out of him. 

10/10 would beat the shit out of that racist POS again.
                            I beat the shit out of him once and the officer just nodded and walked away.
                            I think the game wants you to kill racists. You don’t lose honour for murdering the klan and the eugenics guy and you gain honour for putting that paddy roller piece of shit out of his misery
                        Yeah, it seems to be pretty hit and miss. I had a guy pickpocket me while walking into the tailor the other day, so I shot him in the leg to slow him down so I could catch him. Well, I guess my pistol was too powerful, because he died on the spot in front of a dozen witnesses. Looted him for double what he stole and not a drop of honor was lost and people didn’t even gasp or comment. Walked straight back to the tailor like nothing ever happened.
                        Just as every cop is a criminal, all the sinners are saints
                        yeah you can blast his head off with a shotgun and the officer won’t care lol
                        The whole town hates him
                    I murdered the neo-nazi and the police officer standing 10 feet away did nothing
                        Justified.
                            That’s what I thought
                        How can he be a neo-nazi in 1899 before the first Nazis existed?
                            Paleo-nazi?
                        Neo nazi in 1899? You know what a neo nazi is, right?
                    I turned in a bounty at saint denis sheriff's office and when I walked out the door, the door swung open hitting a police officer. He fell to the ground and I was wanted for assaulting a cop.
                    Man my first day in Saint Denis I was robbed in an alleyway by some dude in overalls. Chased him out onto the street, tackled and hog tied him. When I searched him to get my money back the cops came after me. Didn’t end well for anyone
                        I think the honour system is rather inconsistent in that regard then. Something similar happened to me, I was pickpocketed by a young lad. I ran after him and tackled him, finally getting my money back. No one said a word, no police intervention whatsoever.
                    I loved this story. Fuck I love this game!!!!
                    Sort of same experience here. I just began playing the game and I think I was in chapter 2 or 3. I just hopped on a moving train bc I could and I was bored, so this train went to a part of the map I haven’t discovered yet. I WAS SHOOK. I thought “damn where did this come from?!” When I hopped of the train I just started walking and exploring what the heck this city was. Then I hit someone accidentally, and the whole saint denis police department came after me. I also thought that after the game had ended, you could hop on a boat in Saint Denis and go to Guarma, but unfortunately for me it wasn’t the case
            The problem is you have to greet 3 people for 1 honor but hit 1 guy for 1 less honor
            Oh wow, I thought I was the only one. Spent about 6 hours on a vacation day last week just greeting people in St. Denis. 

Despite being cooped up indoors all day and all week during a pandemic, that day was a good mental health day for the Bankseu, most definitely.
            I once antagonized a coachman. John just said 'Boo!'. I got a 10$ bounty for disturbing the peace
        I have a lot of honor and I don’t wanna loose it
            I accidentally shot a dog in the Heartlands, instant karma drop, and I also felt like shit.

I still think about that good boy/girl, ugh...
                In the first Mission in valentine (complete noob) I started running faster but didn’t knew how to slow down and ran over an dog I felt so bad I restarted the mission
                    You made the right decision!
                        Wow, guess I’m pure evil
                            You kill innocent pets in the game?
                                What an monster
                                Nope, but I kill every single human I see
                                    That's fine.
                I accidentally punted a chicken in saint denis. Needless to say it escalated very quickly.
                You mean good BOAHHH*
        Counteract that small massacre with a little fishing.
            1 fish thrown back = one senseless murder forgiven
            Every day just throw a few back!
        I’ve noticed you don’t lose honor and nobody blinks an eye if u beat the shit out of the guy claiming he knows the real differences between each race in saint denis
            Yeah, thats almost one of the easter eggs of the game :P
            I just lassoed him. Took him out of the city to a gator nest. No one said a word. Except him. He said that “we should be sticking together”
    I had that happen to me once I just quit my horse died and I couldn’t shoot them because no matter what you loose an full chunck of honor but need to greet 1.000 people to get to another honor level
    I just got off my horse at the trapper and lost honor!?
    Or when you accidentally ride someone else's horse.
    I think they actually made it so that the NPC's change direction to cut you off
    Or when you antagonise someone and they assault you in front of a cop and yet you get shit when you hit them back
This is one thing I wish they’d fix. One of the things I used to love doing in gta was aggravating one of the npc’s until they pull out a gun and shoot at me, and then the cops get involved and shoot them 

In this, I try that and the sheriffs won’t get involved until they see me throw a punch or shoot back, and then they’re after me
    Or your in town and o Driscoll shoot at you and then you have an thousand witnesses and get followed by law but if you shoot them you loose honor
        This makes a little sense, I know in Valentine they are bribing the lawmen and that’s probably why they are immune to laws. Same with Bronte’s men in Saint Denis.
            But then you shouldn’t lose honour for killing the law, but there’s a lot of things in the game that don’t make sense. Like you kill fucking loads of law during missions, I guess because it was such a dire situation that you had to. But you can get yourself into equally fucked situations where you have to kill law in the free roam and you’ll lose honour.
                The 1 thing that I hate about RDR2 is that you’re not allowed into Blackwater and New Austin as Arthur, you get killed by an invisible sniper. 

It makes no sense since you massacre a lot of people in Strawberry, Valentine, Rhodes and Saint Denis and you’re allowed to roam the surrounding area without an invisible sniper.
                    I don't know why they didn't make the whole map available to Arthur tbh, it's cool going there as John but A.There's not much to do and I get bored of exploring and doing challenges without missions inbetween, and B. It doesn't make sense to go as John because in RDR1 he says he's never been to New Austin
                        [deleted]
                            Definitely not, I think it's cause you spend so much time as him and get attached. Plus he's just way better looking and cooler than John
        Samé with lemoyne raiders who harass you in rhodes or sometimes in saint Denis

I hate how hard it is to get honor but when you defend yourself from someone you instantly lose All that hardly earned honor
        Honor is broken mess of a system that needs to go.
            Why judge a subtle, nuanced character by a binary good-evil metric, at all?
                The idea is that you know killing is bad. Being dishonorable isn't necessarily you being an evil asshole, it just means you're partaking in the act of murder and for that people look down on you.
                I think it’s deliberately a representation of how you’re seen by the world, not an actual judge of Arthur’s nuanced character. There’s times you’re forced into good or bad things even though your honor should reflect otherwise. 

Hence the cheaper shop prices and such. NPCs “see” what you do and think you’re a good dude, so they give you a discount. 

The system still has flaws, but looking at it from that angle it makes a bit more sense
                    Then why does my honor go down when I murder somebody whether there are witnesses of not?
                    My issue is, is how tf does the rest of the world know I killed a lone camper in the middle of nowhere?
    Agreed, rdr2 is one of the greatest games ever made, but there needs to be a way to defend yourself without losing honor or getting in trouble with the law.
        I just wanna be able to loot someone I knock out or kill without it being a damn crime is that too much to ask?
    I really don’t like how red dead redemption 2 handled law enforcement. It’s too player centric. I stop a train in the middle of Ambarino miles from any town and the police are there in 60 seconds or less or my drinks are free. The O’Driscolls stop a train 30 feet out of Valentine and the law cannot be bothered to do anything.

O’Driscolls beating him to death nobody cares. I throw a punch at the surly drunk in the saloon and the cops are gunning for me like I firebombed a kitten orphanage.
        Yeah just committing any crime is annoying. It’s funny how you travel so many miles down a road and go past maybe  1 or 2 people but the second you shoot someone the amount of people on the road that comes to pass you makes the LA traffic look like a ghost town
            Oh shit that’s funny cuz it’s true
    Doing this in the police station is the best. They get at least 50 bullets shot into them. The cops are so comically aggressive, and as much as people complain about it, I think it's pretty funny.
    If you make someone want to fight you, pull out your gun and put it back in your holster, they will start shooting at you and the police will shoot them.
    There are two guys who hang out by an outhouse behind the bank in Valentine. I play a game with them every time I come to town.  

I greet them, and they antagonize me. Then I start to slowly ride away on my horse, antagonizing them until they start to come after me. Then I cut towards the police station with the guys firing their guns at me. Then the sheriff fucking kills them! I get a solid kick out of it every time.  

Every so often I get caught for being an ass and get a 'move along' from the sheriff but 9 times out of 10, the sheriff comes and takes them out.
    really? I was like just in Valentine and I aggravated someone into shooting me and Sheriff Malloy gunned his ass down
    I actually have had sheriffs get involved and help but only if you don’t try to fight. If you piss an NPC off then run away and you’re in town, the sheriffs will kill them for you. Just talk a bunch of shit.
    Well I mean you’re the one that looks like that bandit
    Just lasso em or pistol whip them unconscious
every time I wanted to kill someone without losing honor, I would just tie the mf and feed it to some animal, to be eaten alive. Almost never lost honor doing that
    You can get rid of evidence when you throw them in an pig stall

But which pig stall isn’t near some god damn npc or city
        Alligators. There's a thousands of them outside Saint Denis. I do it every so often to the fuckwit who robbed and raped Arthur. :)
            Hold up, how did I miss Arthur getting raped?
                Close to the tiny church is a house you'll hear the guy before you see him.. Go talk to him and he'll invite you in :)
                    Well I at least hope he wines and dines me first lol. Thank you though, I’ll make sure to head out there!
                        Good luck!  :D ^^you're ^^gonna ^^need ^^it.
            I always hunt alligators because they’re easy money and most of them are 3 star
                I'm obviously hunting the wrong kind of ancient scaled lizards, because nearly all of my gators are only one star.
                    Make sure you're using the correct weapons to kill different species or you will always get 1-2 star drops.
                        I know about that, but it certainly doesn't help that they all spawn one star
                            [deleted]
                                It's a trinket that does that.

The legendary ~~deer~~ Buck trinket gives the ability for perfect skins to drop on 2 star animals, not on every drop though.

I don't think I ever saw 1 star go to 3, but I did have a few 2 star corpses give me perfect pelts.
                                    Legendary Buck*
                    There are those 2 bridges and both have much alligators
            Raped?
    holy shit I've never thought of that! gotta find me some leymone raiders
        them gator came in clutch more times than I care to count, tbh
    You lose honor for hogtieing I'm pretty sure
        yes, if you do it "unprovoked". just use a lil bit o Arthur's sass until someone pulls the gun on you. then you are golden. unless it's been patched recently, but I think it should still work
    This is.... morbidly ironic
That one where you help someone and it turns out they’re muggers and ambush you and you fight back and then the cops try and kill you! Where the fuck were you for the injured woman by the road?! Overall it’s fair enough in justice but those game breaking moments piss me off to fuck
    I tied the women up, brought her to the jail in valentine, didn’t get a bounty or anything, so I untied her, and she started beating me, so I bashed her head against a wall and she died in front of the two deputies. 

Absolutely nothing happened.
Had a dude gallop his horse DIRECTLY into the path of my wagon yesterday. Guess his horse died on impact so I lost honor for that. He ended up standing on top of the wagon and trying to punch me from behind so I got off the wagon and tried to fight him. Took me three tries to square up with him because Arthur kept trying to get on the wagon again. Finally got far enough away from the wagon, started fighting, he pulls out a knife mid-fight, I pull out my hatchet and sink it into his groin. He dies. I lose honor again. I got a witness, couldn’t stop them in time. “Crime Noticed: Murder”. 

I love this game but goddamn it makes me want to defenestrate my controller and console sometimes.
    I hate the moment in an robbery when you wanna fake surrender but accidentally jump on your horse again
This game is hella realistic but  they couldnt put in the only rule of the wild west
    And that is?
        Dont draw first
            But what if I draw them?
                I guess thats a constitutional loophole that allows you to do anything
                    I draw my enemies wearing frilly shirts and big hats that are considered a common law fashion faux pas!
            Where'd you get that idea from?

The ability to draw first and shoot a target is the most romanticized cliche in Westerns
                Ever seen a western? Like a very old one. Anyways everytime someone gets shot the shooter always says something like: "he drew first you guysve seen that right? "
                    Ya, but the rule is more if he drew first you can't be held accountable because you were defending yourself, it's not just don't shoot first
                And also that cliche is about both waiting for the otjer one to draw first so it counts as self defense but you also have to deal with the delay of your reaction
One dude ran over my horse, I insulted him and he pulled out a shotgun and shot me. The police proceed to join in and shoot me. Logic 100
@ButchersCreek
Why am I wanted for rescuing someone from the O'Driscoll's or the Lemoyne Raiders?
You Also get attacked by All of van horn if someone steals from you and you try and get it back by hogtieing them

Fucking bullshit
    Worst city in the game
        Atleast you Can harass armadillo as múch as you want they dont attack you

But dont do that to the sick

Or you Can do it if you're just evil or have cheats Turned on
            I turned on cheats for my first playthrough the other day because I wanted Exploding infinite ammo and to deal massive death to cops in Blackwater.

&#x200B;

I wish they had an infinite health cheat though. So my rampage wouldn't need to be interrupted to refill all my cores every few minutes.
            hold up

how does one activate these cheats you speak of
                You go into options and Press triangles (Y if you're on Xbox i think) and idk how on Pc

Its in the bottom right corner
        Had a Guy try to start a fist fight in Van Horn because Arthur greeted him on the way to the baths I ignored him sent arthur on into the bath. I heard shots and some angry sounds outside and came out of the bath about 4 minutes later to the half the town dead include most the shopkeepers who were all replaced with the shops still open. What even is that place.
            Seriously, I confronted a robber who stole 500 dollars from me I tackled him and got my money back, and everyone there just started shooting at me, fuck Van Horn
                The guy actually stole 600 dollars if im correct but only gave you 500

Atleast in saint Denis they let you hogtie and loot the gun shop robber
                    I took him to a secluded spot, killed him looted him and then got the 100
                They fixed this now, if you don’t shoot and loot him nobody bats an eye
                    I did it away from everybody so this might be why
let me just mask my face...o right...that DOES NOTHING. the wanted system in the game is broken.
    I mask my face so I don’t get high bounty

Still get 300 dollar bounty
        I watched a video on that, and apparently, the mask and the clothes swapping are only so random citizens can't identify you.

The idea is that you go in, rob a store or something, and bug out before the cops can get there, and you can get away Scott-free.
            Can confirm, this works. Still sucks that you ALWAYS get recognized when robbing a train.
                Yes this is so annoying like how would they be able to tell
    [deleted]
        So I’m pretty sure the way it works is that if you wear a mask while committing a crime, the NPC’s won’t be able to recognize you. However, the law can see straight through the mask and will know it’s you while committing a crime or if they come because a crime was reported. But if you wear a mask in front of the law while wanted and not committing any crime, I don’t think they recognize you then as long as you keep it moving. I’m not 100% sure on this but this is what I’ve noticed.
I tend to go into Valentine a lot and antagonize people to the point the bring out a gun and shoot me. The sheriff tends to come quickly and shoots them dead lol. But if i antagonize too many people at once i get a bounty warning for 'disturbing the peace' lol
    Do you know the incest brother and sister?

The brother can withstand an whole town and kill the sheriff in 3 hits
        I had no idea? Where is this and where do i find them?
            Near trapper in emerald ranch I think I don’t know anymore but there’s an camper who gives you free stuff (for which you will loose bounty)
But he says those were nice folks but the next day someon told him to stay away from that placd
                Ahhh is this the couple at aberdeen pig farm? If i remember1 rightly someone did say something about them being an incest couple lol. I tend to just shoot the guy then run over the lady with my horse now since the first time i played and came across them, the put something in the food they gave me and took my money. Had to go back for it and killed them both.
                    that guy lives nowhere near a town. how did you get him to shot a town + sheriff
                        The old MMO Art of Kiting
                    If you play again, hogtie the woman and take her to where you woke up after being robbed. She says some weird shit. :)
                        Recently i've taken to hog tieing o driscolls and letting a train run them over... lmao
                    They have their use though. >!Have nearly dead Arthur get robbed just before the last mission as him, leave without getting revenge, and come back as John to get all of Arthur's money back!<
I was at Butchers Creek today. I picked a flower for the exotics quest. I was doing the picking animation when a resident started getting aggressive. I could defuse as I was doing the animation so he just got more and more mad. By the time I had finished, the whole town was aggro to me and filling me with lead. I tried to escape but my horse buckled me off. So I had to kill 6 or 7 of them and lost loads of honour. I WAS JUST PICKING A FLOWER!
    A big price for salvation
I usually shoot first tbh. I never draw iron first, but I usually shoot first. I'm not taking the chance of them hitting my horse or my hat
    Hat is always important
Apparently being a better shot than a gutless worm isn't honorable
I would run to the nearest Sheriff, let them hit me, and the sheriff will shoot them down.
I fucking hate this

Especially when it's legit not even your fault and you weren't trying to harm anyone
The honor system is honestly one of the worst parts like it worked like in rdr1 if someone shot first u were fine
This is where my lenny trainer comes in handy. I know i know, its a cheat.

But i only use it for unfair honor lost like this

I just walking down the street, some feller just punch my head, then i punch him back, he draw his gun and try to shot me, so he is dead in the head. I dont wanna lose honor from that shit
So true lol
*Cough*Vanhorn*Cough*
    I posted this on an comment above but half of Van Horn died while Arthur was taking a bath because some dude got pissed off that I greeted him on the way into the bath.
EVERY DAMN TIME
Just feed your horse, apparently that’s the moral equivalent of murdering someone.
    Really? Mine never goes up feeding my trusty steed!
        I’ve tried killing lots of npcs randomly and overall I have almost max honor.
Everytime im in town and someone melee's me and i run to the sheriffs office and the sheriff shoots the dude that melees me!
    Ok most people shoot at me I then run out of town and throw my Viking ax right through their skull
        Love the Viking Axe
            I found it while doing that Crazy scientist quest near the wolf boy then I tried hunting The legendary elk but couldn’t find clues so I ran along the train tracks then on the train tracks till I found another legendary animal an Wolf near some geysir‘s which look very much like the ones on the jackhammer gang treasure map so I was on an roll
Still couldn’t find the treasure though (don’t like watching youtube bc spoilers)
                Did you get the comb and the helmet from the viking burial site as well.
                    Yea but I still haven’t found that wolf boy he ran away twice but normally he should be in his cave which never happened to me
                        He is a bit weird I ran into him 3 or 4 times before it acted right. I did end up killing him and his wolves, but it felt bad.
                            I don’t really wanna kill him because if you shoot the wolves he will cry and won’t really defend himself anymore it’s really sad
                                He actually jumped me on my way out of the cave after I killed the wolves.
                                    It‘s said that it’s the blacksmith son the one from Rhodes who has an guy locked up in his basement
The Lancaster weapon is by far my favorite the one in his basement
[deleted]
    Han Solo always shoots first
        How is the source comment 53 years old? At least that's what it tells me
            The game is 100 years old by now, dang I feel old.
I think you have to try to defuse first
Yeah it really needs fixing
just shot his gun and make him run away
Murder
Weird thing for me is,  I sometimes don’t,  but I don’t know which time I will.  Another thing you can do though,  If you care more about surviving and honor more than shooting someone,  you can always use dead eye to shoot the weapon spit of their hand.
    Lmao spit of their hand. How dare you take the spit of my hand.
Yeah that was frustrating
Han shot first
    But greedy didn’t defend himself
There’s no defending against Han Solo lol
Lmao so true
It happens when I try to be honorable
    I always try to be honorable but still no matter how often you try in the next mission Micah will just ruin everything and bring your honor to zero
        Just spam hello to every citizen you see as you quest and as long as you don't go on any murder sprees you can easily stay at max for the whole game.

Also, always donate to the monk, and you will have no problems.
            I mostly do side mission before continuing the story
Just feed your horse and it will go up again 🤣
    Feed your horse to let the people forget that you shoot people
        Whispering to your horse after murdering a whole town, “shhh they bad we good shhhh”. Lmao
Lol this just happened to me yesterday
Jokes on you, I don't care if I get bad honor.
    „Is it possible to learn this power?“
Am I the only one that has no idea how these memes are supposed to work
When I rode my horse and I’m to close to someone they move into my horse.
*Honour
    No honor
Every time...
Well guys this has been a blast but if you wanna discuss something I’ll be sleeping now
My favorite: I was thrown from my horse and landed in someone's wagon. They started shooting me in the face at close range. When I shot them in self defense, I lost honor and triggered the swamp gestapo.
Someone just randomly decided to shoot me and I tried to punch them because, well, ya know, self defense, anyway that's the story of how I lost my hat in Valentine
    You can get it back from your horse
        Yeah I figured that out eventually, missed the hat a lot while I didn't know that though.
            I figured it out after picking up every hat hat looked cool when I loose my hat
Forget honor! I stepped on that one guy’s hands who was hanging off a cliff after witnessing something I did! Its the wildwest! No one said I had to be a goody two shoe cowboy!
Yeah it’s not my fault his camp was out in the open.

Not my fault I just so happened to have my bandana on.

Not my fault I just so happened to be EXTREMELY bored.
-*revives another players horses*- *-mounts said horse to feed it nummies*- **HORSE THIEF!!**
    I accidentally once took the wrong horse I realised it after looking in my inventory and I couldn’t search my guns then I looked on the map and it was kilometers away
Accidentally hit a guy with my horse, he open fired. In my efforts for self defense, he lost his life, caused the deaths of 12 other civilians being brave and I'd say around 30 cops and me a bunch of money and bullets smh
 Now in the epilogue I am evil. I go into the cheats turn all on and i release hell.
when you try to get on your horse but instead tackle the nearest npc and get shot to death by saint denis’ infinite police force
on the flip side- 1 horse pet=mass murder forgiven
    I think that’s fair
God this meme template is so cringey and cancerous.
    I don’t watch friends I just made an meme
Viva la dirt league on YouTube nailed this scenario perfectly.
    You watch them too?
        All the time.
            Nice
What is this meme template name?
    It’s from Friends. It’s about Phoebe teaching Joey how to speak French but Joey keeps on saying random made up words even though he could say each of the french words correctly. He just couldn’t say all of the words together in a sentence.
    Search repeat my sentence template
So true tho
I just lost honor and had to flee from Saint Denis because I whistled and my horse bowled someone over on the way to me.
You do a Mexican stand-off and you loose honor for killing the dude sometimes. Or at least in my experience
    I didnt
Maybe that was because I looted the guy he killed them killed him for shooting me
    That explains stuff
One of the biggest BS ways you lose honor is when you kill Charlotte Balfour’s pervert stalker.  When I blew his head off and heard that bell ring. I was like “Really Rockstar?!”.
This is a problem in single player too. Immediately fire whoever designed the bounty system. It is so painfully stupid in design it actually offends me it made into the game. 

Cops ignore NPCs literally firing bullets into crowds at you, but if you fire back, it’s over. Running your horse into someone is a capital offense, punishable by public death. The disguises/bandanna almost never worked. Killing a witness breeds 5 more witnesses. Every. Single. Time.
i one time got a wanted level for taking part in one of the random encounters where you shoot at jugs or vases or what have you. got wanted for “DiStUrBiNg tHe PeAcE” or whatever & just got off lol
Don’t even get me started on the wanted system in this game
You get hit in the sheriffs office, in front of the sheriff, and you don’t hit back. $5 bounty on your head.
You guys still have honor to lose? I’ve been at 0 since my first week playing
 Bruh I farmed honor back from worst possible level of honor to just about half and when I did a honorable act that put me into the good side, it would put me back to dishonorable because I had already gone through the majority of the story dishonorably. Did anybody know this?
I get that it’s silly you lose honour, but getting it back is as easy as petting or feeding your horse... so seems like it’s just easier for them to leave this and work on something like , oh gee I don’t know, maybe your online server kicking me 10 times a day!
Had a lemoyne raider attack me in Rhodes. He pulled a knife on me and stabbed me a few times so I shot him. Law was on me on two seconds for Murder.
I somehow get this even if I kill a tiny animal on horseback.
Lol that’s so true, a guy jumped off his horse LITERALLY in front of mine and I hit him and I lost honor
Release 2000 fish and you should be alright
Van horn be like
You ever get in a brawl at van horn then have EVERY SINGLE PERSON there attack you? Good times.
Bear one ~~another's~~ burden
Why is it when a guy starts a fight with me it’s ok if I beat him to death, but heaven forbid I loot him🤣🤣🤣
I had a guy attack me after I said hello and I lost honor after knocking him out
I instigated a bunch of Npc’s who then drew their weapons in Valentine. The sheriff killed all of them. But some annoying Npc lady got me wanted for murder? Also one pulled a knife on me and I hit him with my pistol. I got wanted
"keep walking jackass"

*Gunshots*
That’s alright you just have to feed your horse to get that honor back.
    Go play the story mode if you hadn't
        Oh I have I just thought you were talking about online.
Spoiler alert plz
    There are no spoilers here
        No I know it's a joke bc some people get so upset abt that
            It’s just mildly annoying that if you greet 1 thousand people you get 1 more honor level hit 5 people you loose an level
                No I know been that's actually the point of the game. Ur supposed to kinda have low honor in the beginning of the game and it's hard to get it up and easy to lose it. But then towards the end there are a lot more options to get high honor and it gives u more per nice thing you do. I suppose it bc at the beginning they are just this mean gang and they are killing and robbing everyone but towards the end he kind of realizes that Dutch isn't doing the right thing and that times are changing and his time is coming to an end and he wants to change his ways
                    I am honor level 7 in 5th chapter and max level is 8
                        I mean in chapter 6 more so bc i just got to chapter 6 with the absolute lowest honor and after an hour or two of playing I got to max honor no joke
                            Oh ok I’ll try thanks
                                Yeah the beginning of the game is meant to be played with low honor since every mission and activity is bad. In the final chapter Arthur tries to become a better person so you have more options for honor.
Yes but that’s how it should be in most of the cases. You provoked a response from the NPC’s to start shooting you.
    I was at the camp and I was leaving and he started shooting what else was I supposed to do my horse was super low
        For the future, if you hogtie them you can peacefully leave without loosing honor, or if you do want to kill them, just lasso them and drag them into the campfire, they burn and die but you dont loose honor.
            Thanks
        Honestly you provoked him enough to feel threatened enough to defend himself. I mean obviously in that situation it’s killed or be killed but a majority of the time you started the altercation so the game is basically saying they didn’t need to die but you made it so you’d have to kill them.
I was being robbed in Saint Denis and killed the robbers 2 seconds later there are 3 officers behind me
Even if you disarm them.
Self defense should be a reason Rockstar, like I get into the first town and talk to people, but if someone runs into my horsey, I'm commiting a massacre
Just do a lap around Strawberry, friend. You’ll be as honorable as a pickle on a tightrope.
Just started the game last night. Passed a man that asked me if I was "a real American gunslinger" and wanted to test me so I shot his hat off without hurting him. He shot me in the gut and I had to kill him
He shot first... after I robbed him
I’m a witness!!!
I was very surprised, when my honor increased after killing that man from stranger mission in Rhodes called The iniquities of history
Just say hi to people in Saint Denis that will smooth things over.
    Exactly! Saint Denis is the best place to farm honour.
        Until the street urchin gets the feds on you for no reason...
            I will never forget my first day in Saint Denis. I was literally a tourist, only taking photos, saying hi to everyone, buying a new suit. Then, I was in the park, minding my own business when suddenly someone started stabbing me. It was the hobo guy and he attacked me right in front of the officer. After a few secs of confusion I tackled him and knocked him out. Then the officer held a gun at me. Long story short, I ran away from the city, taking out every fucking star on my way.
                That’s insane because I literally threw a tomahawk, in broad daylight, police officer probably ten feet away looking at me, at the dude preaching about eugenics and no one blinked an eye.
                    you can also tie him up and put him on a horse and feed him to gators and won’t lose honor
                        Hold my health tonic I’m starting over part four lmao
                            i personal chose to carry him all the way to a bear spawn in the west grizzlies, let him get yeeted by the bear, get the bear to leave, then took his corpse to the top of hagen and watch him roll down the sheerest cliff i could find
                            [deleted]
                                He comes back too
                            I wish you could it’s the best chapter somewhat
                        Can this he done to all preachers? The guy in Strawberry really grinds my gears. Would love to tie him up and feed him to the bears.
                        It doesnt feel as good as doing it to the suffragettes tho
                            We got an edgelord here
                                Dont forget to downvote
                            based
                    He's the only civilian NPC that can be killed with no consequences. Maybe the klansmen too but they were in a remote area when I committed that happy little massacre.
                        You don't even need to kill them. The KKK encounters normally end up bad for them anyways on their own.

No joke, if you haven't watched all 4(?) all the way through you need to.
                            I remember the first time I came across a klan meeting, I watched it play out a little then got tired of it and threw dynamite at them and shot the stragglers. I got +20 health exp for every kill too, thing is I couldn't replicate the exp gain after that which is kinda weird. Not sure why I got exp that one time and that time only but I thought it was some kind of reward for killing them? So I just assumed that you were supposed to intervene and kill them yourself.
                            My only regret is that I couldn’t kill more of them
                    You actually don't get any punishment whatsoever for killing him as far as I have heard
                    Justified.
                        PuRe iS bEtTeR
                    when I shot that guy, I got a 5$ bounty for "disturbing the peace"
                        You're supposed to throw a tomahawk, it's quieter.
                            Hey, you can murder him as brutally as you like, but don't make a scene!
                            I've given him both barrels of a double barrel shotgun straight to the head, cop standing nearby and got away with it. Many times.
                                You obviously use his head as a silencer, thus not disturbing the peace.
                    Yeah, I've disintegrated that racist piece of shit's head many times, had a pleasant conversation with the officer standing 20 feet away, then gone on my merry way saying hi to folks. Never gets any less satisfying.
                        Does he respawn?
                            I hope so. I think he does
                                Lmao the first time I killed him was so bland? Hopefully I see his dumbfuck face again— already planning a good murder :p
                    If you antagonize the eugenics guy enough he calls you a fool, and you can beat the shit out of him with no consequences, but because he keeps respawning you can keep beating him without saying anything with no consequence, even when a cop is directly next to you
                        Once Arthur goes “I’ll show you a fool!” or whatever it was and he starts to run away, I kited his escape down to the boat docks. He paused a bit when he got to the end of one and I just barreled into him and knocked him off the edge. No tackle or push, just a collision. After he falls in and dies Arthur said “sorry bout that, don’t know what’s gotten into me today”
                    Yeah, the cops turn a blind eye to anything you do to eugenics guy. Which is awesome. Fuck that guy
                    Yeah the cops don't care about that guy. Rockstar did a good with that one. There's always an officer about 20 feet away from him, and I always beat the shit out of him. 

10/10 would beat the shit out of that racist POS again.
                        I beat the shit out of him once and the officer just nodded and walked away.
                        I think the game wants you to kill racists. You don’t lose honour for murdering the klan and the eugenics guy and you gain honour for putting that paddy roller piece of shit out of his misery
                    Yeah, it seems to be pretty hit and miss. I had a guy pickpocket me while walking into the tailor the other day, so I shot him in the leg to slow him down so I could catch him. Well, I guess my pistol was too powerful, because he died on the spot in front of a dozen witnesses. Looted him for double what he stole and not a drop of honor was lost and people didn’t even gasp or comment. Walked straight back to the tailor like nothing ever happened.
                    Just as every cop is a criminal, all the sinners are saints
                    yeah you can blast his head off with a shotgun and the officer won’t care lol
                    The whole town hates him
                I murdered the neo-nazi and the police officer standing 10 feet away did nothing
                    Justified.
                        That’s what I thought
                    How can he be a neo-nazi in 1899 before the first Nazis existed?
                        Paleo-nazi?
                    Neo nazi in 1899? You know what a neo nazi is, right?
                I turned in a bounty at saint denis sheriff's office and when I walked out the door, the door swung open hitting a police officer. He fell to the ground and I was wanted for assaulting a cop.
                Man my first day in Saint Denis I was robbed in an alleyway by some dude in overalls. Chased him out onto the street, tackled and hog tied him. When I searched him to get my money back the cops came after me. Didn’t end well for anyone
                    I think the honour system is rather inconsistent in that regard then. Something similar happened to me, I was pickpocketed by a young lad. I ran after him and tackled him, finally getting my money back. No one said a word, no police intervention whatsoever.
                I loved this story. Fuck I love this game!!!!
                Sort of same experience here. I just began playing the game and I think I was in chapter 2 or 3. I just hopped on a moving train bc I could and I was bored, so this train went to a part of the map I haven’t discovered yet. I WAS SHOOK. I thought “damn where did this come from?!” When I hopped of the train I just started walking and exploring what the heck this city was. Then I hit someone accidentally, and the whole saint denis police department came after me. I also thought that after the game had ended, you could hop on a boat in Saint Denis and go to Guarma, but unfortunately for me it wasn’t the case
        The problem is you have to greet 3 people for 1 honor but hit 1 guy for 1 less honor
        Oh wow, I thought I was the only one. Spent about 6 hours on a vacation day last week just greeting people in St. Denis. 

Despite being cooped up indoors all day and all week during a pandemic, that day was a good mental health day for the Bankseu, most definitely.
        I once antagonized a coachman. John just said 'Boo!'. I got a 10$ bounty for disturbing the peace
    I have a lot of honor and I don’t wanna loose it
        I accidentally shot a dog in the Heartlands, instant karma drop, and I also felt like shit.

I still think about that good boy/girl, ugh...
            In the first Mission in valentine (complete noob) I started running faster but didn’t knew how to slow down and ran over an dog I felt so bad I restarted the mission
                You made the right decision!
                    Wow, guess I’m pure evil
                        You kill innocent pets in the game?
                            What an monster
                            Nope, but I kill every single human I see
                                That's fine.
            I accidentally punted a chicken in saint denis. Needless to say it escalated very quickly.
            You mean good BOAHHH*
    Counteract that small massacre with a little fishing.
        1 fish thrown back = one senseless murder forgiven
        Every day just throw a few back!
    I’ve noticed you don’t lose honor and nobody blinks an eye if u beat the shit out of the guy claiming he knows the real differences between each race in saint denis
        Yeah, thats almost one of the easter eggs of the game :P
        I just lassoed him. Took him out of the city to a gator nest. No one said a word. Except him. He said that “we should be sticking together”
I had that happen to me once I just quit my horse died and I couldn’t shoot them because no matter what you loose an full chunck of honor but need to greet 1.000 people to get to another honor level
I just got off my horse at the trapper and lost honor!?
Or when you accidentally ride someone else's horse.
I think they actually made it so that the NPC's change direction to cut you off
Or when you antagonise someone and they assault you in front of a cop and yet you get shit when you hit them back
Or your in town and o Driscoll shoot at you and then you have an thousand witnesses and get followed by law but if you shoot them you loose honor
    This makes a little sense, I know in Valentine they are bribing the lawmen and that’s probably why they are immune to laws. Same with Bronte’s men in Saint Denis.
        But then you shouldn’t lose honour for killing the law, but there’s a lot of things in the game that don’t make sense. Like you kill fucking loads of law during missions, I guess because it was such a dire situation that you had to. But you can get yourself into equally fucked situations where you have to kill law in the free roam and you’ll lose honour.
            The 1 thing that I hate about RDR2 is that you’re not allowed into Blackwater and New Austin as Arthur, you get killed by an invisible sniper. 

It makes no sense since you massacre a lot of people in Strawberry, Valentine, Rhodes and Saint Denis and you’re allowed to roam the surrounding area without an invisible sniper.
                I don't know why they didn't make the whole map available to Arthur tbh, it's cool going there as John but A.There's not much to do and I get bored of exploring and doing challenges without missions inbetween, and B. It doesn't make sense to go as John because in RDR1 he says he's never been to New Austin

                        Definitely not, I think it's cause you spend so much time as him and get attached. Plus he's just way better looking and cooler than John
    Samé with lemoyne raiders who harass you in rhodes or sometimes in saint Denis

I hate how hard it is to get honor but when you defend yourself from someone you instantly lose All that hardly earned honor
    Honor is broken mess of a system that needs to go.
        Why judge a subtle, nuanced character by a binary good-evil metric, at all?
            The idea is that you know killing is bad. Being dishonorable isn't necessarily you being an evil asshole, it just means you're partaking in the act of murder and for that people look down on you.
            I think it’s deliberately a representation of how you’re seen by the world, not an actual judge of Arthur’s nuanced character. There’s times you’re forced into good or bad things even though your honor should reflect otherwise. 

Hence the cheaper shop prices and such. NPCs “see” what you do and think you’re a good dude, so they give you a discount. 

The system still has flaws, but looking at it from that angle it makes a bit more sense
                Then why does my honor go down when I murder somebody whether there are witnesses of not?
                My issue is, is how tf does the rest of the world know I killed a lone camper in the middle of nowhere?
Agreed, rdr2 is one of the greatest games ever made, but there needs to be a way to defend yourself without losing honor or getting in trouble with the law.
    I just wanna be able to loot someone I knock out or kill without it being a damn crime is that too much to ask?
I really don’t like how red dead redemption 2 handled law enforcement. It’s too player centric. I stop a train in the middle of Ambarino miles from any town and the police are there in 60 seconds or less or my drinks are free. The O’Driscolls stop a train 30 feet out of Valentine and the law cannot be bothered to do anything.

O’Driscolls beating him to death nobody cares. I throw a punch at the surly drunk in the saloon and the cops are gunning for me like I firebombed a kitten orphanage.
    Yeah just committing any crime is annoying. It’s funny how you travel so many miles down a road and go past maybe  1 or 2 people but the second you shoot someone the amount of people on the road that comes to pass you makes the LA traffic look like a ghost town
        Oh shit that’s funny cuz it’s true
Doing this in the police station is the best. They get at least 50 bullets shot into them. The cops are so comically aggressive, and as much as people complain about it, I think it's pretty funny.
If you make someone want to fight you, pull out your gun and put it back in your holster, they will start shooting at you and the police will shoot them.
There are two guys who hang out by an outhouse behind the bank in Valentine. I play a game with them every time I come to town.  

I greet them, and they antagonize me. Then I start to slowly ride away on my horse, antagonizing them until they start to come after me. Then I cut towards the police station with the guys firing their guns at me. Then the sheriff fucking kills them! I get a solid kick out of it every time.  

Every so often I get caught for being an ass and get a 'move along' from the sheriff but 9 times out of 10, the sheriff comes and takes them out.
really? I was like just in Valentine and I aggravated someone into shooting me and Sheriff Malloy gunned his ass down
I actually have had sheriffs get involved and help but only if you don’t try to fight. If you piss an NPC off then run away and you’re in town, the sheriffs will kill them for you. Just talk a bunch of shit.
Well I mean you’re the one that looks like that bandit
Just lasso em or pistol whip them unconscious
You can get rid of evidence when you throw them in an pig stall

But which pig stall isn’t near some god damn npc or city
    Alligators. There's a thousands of them outside Saint Denis. I do it every so often to the fuckwit who robbed and raped Arthur. :)
        Hold up, how did I miss Arthur getting raped?
            Close to the tiny church is a house you'll hear the guy before you see him.. Go talk to him and he'll invite you in :)
                Well I at least hope he wines and dines me first lol. Thank you though, I’ll make sure to head out there!
                    Good luck!  :D ^^you're ^^gonna ^^need ^^it.
        I always hunt alligators because they’re easy money and most of them are 3 star
            I'm obviously hunting the wrong kind of ancient scaled lizards, because nearly all of my gators are only one star.
                Make sure you're using the correct weapons to kill different species or you will always get 1-2 star drops.
                    I know about that, but it certainly doesn't help that they all spawn one star
                        [deleted]
                            It's a trinket that does that.

The legendary ~~deer~~ Buck trinket gives the ability for perfect skins to drop on 2 star animals, not on every drop though.

I don't think I ever saw 1 star go to 3, but I did have a few 2 star corpses give me perfect pelts.
                                Legendary Buck*
                There are those 2 bridges and both have much alligators
        Raped?
holy shit I've never thought of that! gotta find me some leymone raiders
    them gator came in clutch more times than I care to count, tbh
You lose honor for hogtieing I'm pretty sure
    yes, if you do it "unprovoked". just use a lil bit o Arthur's sass until someone pulls the gun on you. then you are golden. unless it's been patched recently, but I think it should still work
This is.... morbidly ironic
I tied the women up, brought her to the jail in valentine, didn’t get a bounty or anything, so I untied her, and she started beating me, so I bashed her head against a wall and she died in front of the two deputies. 

Absolutely nothing happened.
I hate the moment in an robbery when you wanna fake surrender but accidentally jump on your horse again
And that is?
    Dont draw first
        But what if I draw them?
            I guess thats a constitutional loophole that allows you to do anything
                I draw my enemies wearing frilly shirts and big hats that are considered a common law fashion faux pas!
        Where'd you get that idea from?

The ability to draw first and shoot a target is the most romanticized cliche in Westerns
            Ever seen a western? Like a very old one. Anyways everytime someone gets shot the shooter always says something like: "he drew first you guysve seen that right? "
                Ya, but the rule is more if he drew first you can't be held accountable because you were defending yourself, it's not just don't shoot first
            And also that cliche is about both waiting for the otjer one to draw first so it counts as self defense but you also have to deal with the delay of your reaction
Worst city in the game
    Atleast you Can harass armadillo as múch as you want they dont attack you

But dont do that to the sick

Or you Can do it if you're just evil or have cheats Turned on
        I turned on cheats for my first playthrough the other day because I wanted Exploding infinite ammo and to deal massive death to cops in Blackwater.

&#x200B;

I wish they had an infinite health cheat though. So my rampage wouldn't need to be interrupted to refill all my cores every few minutes.
        hold up

how does one activate these cheats you speak of
            You go into options and Press triangles (Y if you're on Xbox i think) and idk how on Pc

Its in the bottom right corner
    Had a Guy try to start a fist fight in Van Horn because Arthur greeted him on the way to the baths I ignored him sent arthur on into the bath. I heard shots and some angry sounds outside and came out of the bath about 4 minutes later to the half the town dead include most the shopkeepers who were all replaced with the shops still open. What even is that place.
        Seriously, I confronted a robber who stole 500 dollars from me I tackled him and got my money back, and everyone there just started shooting at me, fuck Van Horn
            The guy actually stole 600 dollars if im correct but only gave you 500

Atleast in saint Denis they let you hogtie and loot the gun shop robber
                I took him to a secluded spot, killed him looted him and then got the 100
            They fixed this now, if you don’t shoot and loot him nobody bats an eye
                I did it away from everybody so this might be why
I mask my face so I don’t get high bounty

Still get 300 dollar bounty
    I watched a video on that, and apparently, the mask and the clothes swapping are only so random citizens can't identify you.

The idea is that you go in, rob a store or something, and bug out before the cops can get there, and you can get away Scott-free.
        Can confirm, this works. Still sucks that you ALWAYS get recognized when robbing a train.
            Yes this is so annoying like how would they be able to tell
[deleted]
    So I’m pretty sure the way it works is that if you wear a mask while committing a crime, the NPC’s won’t be able to recognize you. However, the law can see straight through the mask and will know it’s you while committing a crime or if they come because a crime was reported. But if you wear a mask in front of the law while wanted and not committing any crime, I don’t think they recognize you then as long as you keep it moving. I’m not 100% sure on this but this is what I’ve noticed.
Do you know the incest brother and sister?

The brother can withstand an whole town and kill the sheriff in 3 hits
    I had no idea? Where is this and where do i find them?
        Near trapper in emerald ranch I think I don’t know anymore but there’s an camper who gives you free stuff (for which you will loose bounty)
But he says those were nice folks but the next day someon told him to stay away from that placd
            Ahhh is this the couple at aberdeen pig farm? If i remember1 rightly someone did say something about them being an incest couple lol. I tend to just shoot the guy then run over the lady with my horse now since the first time i played and came across them, the put something in the food they gave me and took my money. Had to go back for it and killed them both.
                that guy lives nowhere near a town. how did you get him to shot a town + sheriff
                    The old MMO Art of Kiting
                If you play again, hogtie the woman and take her to where you woke up after being robbed. She says some weird shit. :)
                    Recently i've taken to hog tieing o driscolls and letting a train run them over... lmao
                They have their use though. >!Have nearly dead Arthur get robbed just before the last mission as him, leave without getting revenge, and come back as John to get all of Arthur's money back!<
A big price for salvation
Hat is always important
I posted this on an comment above but half of Van Horn died while Arthur was taking a bath because some dude got pissed off that I greeted him on the way into the bath.
Really? Mine never goes up feeding my trusty steed!
    I’ve tried killing lots of npcs randomly and overall I have almost max honor.
Ok most people shoot at me I then run out of town and throw my Viking ax right through their skull
    Love the Viking Axe
        I found it while doing that Crazy scientist quest near the wolf boy then I tried hunting The legendary elk but couldn’t find clues so I ran along the train tracks then on the train tracks till I found another legendary animal an Wolf near some geysir‘s which look very much like the ones on the jackhammer gang treasure map so I was on an roll
Still couldn’t find the treasure though (don’t like watching youtube bc spoilers)
            Did you get the comb and the helmet from the viking burial site as well.
                Yea but I still haven’t found that wolf boy he ran away twice but normally he should be in his cave which never happened to me
                    He is a bit weird I ran into him 3 or 4 times before it acted right. I did end up killing him and his wolves, but it felt bad.
                        I don’t really wanna kill him because if you shoot the wolves he will cry and won’t really defend himself anymore it’s really sad
                            He actually jumped me on my way out of the cave after I killed the wolves.
                                It‘s said that it’s the blacksmith son the one from Rhodes who has an guy locked up in his basement
The Lancaster weapon is by far my favorite the one in his basement
Han Solo always shoots first
    How is the source comment 53 years old? At least that's what it tells me
        The game is 100 years old by now, dang I feel old.
Lmao spit of their hand. How dare you take the spit of my hand.
But greedy didn’t defend himself
I always try to be honorable but still no matter how often you try in the next mission Micah will just ruin everything and bring your honor to zero
    Just spam hello to every citizen you see as you quest and as long as you don't go on any murder sprees you can easily stay at max for the whole game.

Also, always donate to the monk, and you will have no problems.
        I mostly do side mission before continuing the story
Feed your horse to let the people forget that you shoot people
    Whispering to your horse after murdering a whole town, “shhh they bad we good shhhh”. Lmao
„Is it possible to learn this power?“
No honor
You can get it back from your horse
    Yeah I figured that out eventually, missed the hat a lot while I didn't know that though.
        I figured it out after picking up every hat hat looked cool when I loose my hat
I accidentally once took the wrong horse I realised it after looking in my inventory and I couldn’t search my guns then I looked on the map and it was kilometers away
I think that’s fair
I don’t watch friends I just made an meme
You watch them too?
    All the time.
        Nice
It’s from Friends. It’s about Phoebe teaching Joey how to speak French but Joey keeps on saying random made up words even though he could say each of the french words correctly. He just couldn’t say all of the words together in a sentence.
Search repeat my sentence template
I didnt
That explains stuff
Go play the story mode if you hadn't
    Oh I have I just thought you were talking about online.
There are no spoilers here
    No I know it's a joke bc some people get so upset abt that
        It’s just mildly annoying that if you greet 1 thousand people you get 1 more honor level hit 5 people you loose an level
            No I know been that's actually the point of the game. Ur supposed to kinda have low honor in the beginning of the game and it's hard to get it up and easy to lose it. But then towards the end there are a lot more options to get high honor and it gives u more per nice thing you do. I suppose it bc at the beginning they are just this mean gang and they are killing and robbing everyone but towards the end he kind of realizes that Dutch isn't doing the right thing and that times are changing and his time is coming to an end and he wants to change his ways
                I am honor level 7 in 5th chapter and max level is 8
                    I mean in chapter 6 more so bc i just got to chapter 6 with the absolute lowest honor and after an hour or two of playing I got to max honor no joke
                        Oh ok I’ll try thanks
                            Yeah the beginning of the game is meant to be played with low honor since every mission and activity is bad. In the final chapter Arthur tries to become a better person so you have more options for honor.
I was at the camp and I was leaving and he started shooting what else was I supposed to do my horse was super low
    For the future, if you hogtie them you can peacefully leave without loosing honor, or if you do want to kill them, just lasso them and drag them into the campfire, they burn and die but you dont loose honor.
        Thanks
    Honestly you provoked him enough to feel threatened enough to defend himself. I mean obviously in that situation it’s killed or be killed but a majority of the time you started the altercation so the game is basically saying they didn’t need to die but you made it so you’d have to kill them.
Exactly! Saint Denis is the best place to farm honour.
    Until the street urchin gets the feds on you for no reason...
        I will never forget my first day in Saint Denis. I was literally a tourist, only taking photos, saying hi to everyone, buying a new suit. Then, I was in the park, minding my own business when suddenly someone started stabbing me. It was the hobo guy and he attacked me right in front of the officer. After a few secs of confusion I tackled him and knocked him out. Then the officer held a gun at me. Long story short, I ran away from the city, taking out every fucking star on my way.
            That’s insane because I literally threw a tomahawk, in broad daylight, police officer probably ten feet away looking at me, at the dude preaching about eugenics and no one blinked an eye.
                you can also tie him up and put him on a horse and feed him to gators and won’t lose honor
                    Hold my health tonic I’m starting over part four lmao
                        i personal chose to carry him all the way to a bear spawn in the west grizzlies, let him get yeeted by the bear, get the bear to leave, then took his corpse to the top of hagen and watch him roll down the sheerest cliff i could find
                        [deleted]
                            He comes back too
                        I wish you could it’s the best chapter somewhat
                    Can this he done to all preachers? The guy in Strawberry really grinds my gears. Would love to tie him up and feed him to the bears.
                    It doesnt feel as good as doing it to the suffragettes tho
                        We got an edgelord here
                            Dont forget to downvote
                        based
                He's the only civilian NPC that can be killed with no consequences. Maybe the klansmen too but they were in a remote area when I committed that happy little massacre.
                    You don't even need to kill them. The KKK encounters normally end up bad for them anyways on their own.

No joke, if you haven't watched all 4(?) all the way through you need to.
                        I remember the first time I came across a klan meeting, I watched it play out a little then got tired of it and threw dynamite at them and shot the stragglers. I got +20 health exp for every kill too, thing is I couldn't replicate the exp gain after that which is kinda weird. Not sure why I got exp that one time and that time only but I thought it was some kind of reward for killing them? So I just assumed that you were supposed to intervene and kill them yourself.
                        My only regret is that I couldn’t kill more of them
                You actually don't get any punishment whatsoever for killing him as far as I have heard
                Justified.
                    PuRe iS bEtTeR
                when I shot that guy, I got a 5$ bounty for "disturbing the peace"
                    You're supposed to throw a tomahawk, it's quieter.
                        Hey, you can murder him as brutally as you like, but don't make a scene!
                        I've given him both barrels of a double barrel shotgun straight to the head, cop standing nearby and got away with it. Many times.
                            You obviously use his head as a silencer, thus not disturbing the peace.
                Yeah, I've disintegrated that racist piece of shit's head many times, had a pleasant conversation with the officer standing 20 feet away, then gone on my merry way saying hi to folks. Never gets any less satisfying.
                    Does he respawn?
                        I hope so. I think he does
                            Lmao the first time I killed him was so bland? Hopefully I see his dumbfuck face again— already planning a good murder :p
                If you antagonize the eugenics guy enough he calls you a fool, and you can beat the shit out of him with no consequences, but because he keeps respawning you can keep beating him without saying anything with no consequence, even when a cop is directly next to you
                    Once Arthur goes “I’ll show you a fool!” or whatever it was and he starts to run away, I kited his escape down to the boat docks. He paused a bit when he got to the end of one and I just barreled into him and knocked him off the edge. No tackle or push, just a collision. After he falls in and dies Arthur said “sorry bout that, don’t know what’s gotten into me today”
                Yeah, the cops turn a blind eye to anything you do to eugenics guy. Which is awesome. Fuck that guy
                Yeah the cops don't care about that guy. Rockstar did a good with that one. There's always an officer about 20 feet away from him, and I always beat the shit out of him. 

10/10 would beat the shit out of that racist POS again.
                    I beat the shit out of him once and the officer just nodded and walked away.
                    I think the game wants you to kill racists. You don’t lose honour for murdering the klan and the eugenics guy and you gain honour for putting that paddy roller piece of shit out of his misery
                Yeah, it seems to be pretty hit and miss. I had a guy pickpocket me while walking into the tailor the other day, so I shot him in the leg to slow him down so I could catch him. Well, I guess my pistol was too powerful, because he died on the spot in front of a dozen witnesses. Looted him for double what he stole and not a drop of honor was lost and people didn’t even gasp or comment. Walked straight back to the tailor like nothing ever happened.
                Just as every cop is a criminal, all the sinners are saints
                yeah you can blast his head off with a shotgun and the officer won’t care lol
                The whole town hates him
            I murdered the neo-nazi and the police officer standing 10 feet away did nothing
                Justified.
                    That’s what I thought
                How can he be a neo-nazi in 1899 before the first Nazis existed?
                    Paleo-nazi?
                Neo nazi in 1899? You know what a neo nazi is, right?
            I turned in a bounty at saint denis sheriff's office and when I walked out the door, the door swung open hitting a police officer. He fell to the ground and I was wanted for assaulting a cop.
            Man my first day in Saint Denis I was robbed in an alleyway by some dude in overalls. Chased him out onto the street, tackled and hog tied him. When I searched him to get my money back the cops came after me. Didn’t end well for anyone
                I think the honour system is rather inconsistent in that regard then. Something similar happened to me, I was pickpocketed by a young lad. I ran after him and tackled him, finally getting my money back. No one said a word, no police intervention whatsoever.
            I loved this story. Fuck I love this game!!!!
            Sort of same experience here. I just began playing the game and I think I was in chapter 2 or 3. I just hopped on a moving train bc I could and I was bored, so this train went to a part of the map I haven’t discovered yet. I WAS SHOOK. I thought “damn where did this come from?!” When I hopped of the train I just started walking and exploring what the heck this city was. Then I hit someone accidentally, and the whole saint denis police department came after me. I also thought that after the game had ended, you could hop on a boat in Saint Denis and go to Guarma, but unfortunately for me it wasn’t the case
    The problem is you have to greet 3 people for 1 honor but hit 1 guy for 1 less honor
    Oh wow, I thought I was the only one. Spent about 6 hours on a vacation day last week just greeting people in St. Denis. 

Despite being cooped up indoors all day and all week during a pandemic, that day was a good mental health day for the Bankseu, most definitely.
    I once antagonized a coachman. John just said 'Boo!'. I got a 10$ bounty for disturbing the peace
I have a lot of honor and I don’t wanna loose it
    I accidentally shot a dog in the Heartlands, instant karma drop, and I also felt like shit.

I still think about that good boy/girl, ugh...
        In the first Mission in valentine (complete noob) I started running faster but didn’t knew how to slow down and ran over an dog I felt so bad I restarted the mission
            You made the right decision!
                Wow, guess I’m pure evil
                    You kill innocent pets in the game?
                        What an monster
                        Nope, but I kill every single human I see
                            That's fine.
        I accidentally punted a chicken in saint denis. Needless to say it escalated very quickly.
        You mean good BOAHHH*
Counteract that small massacre with a little fishing.
    1 fish thrown back = one senseless murder forgiven
    Every day just throw a few back!
I’ve noticed you don’t lose honor and nobody blinks an eye if u beat the shit out of the guy claiming he knows the real differences between each race in saint denis
    Yeah, thats almost one of the easter eggs of the game :P
    I just lassoed him. Took him out of the city to a gator nest. No one said a word. Except him. He said that “we should be sticking together”
This makes a little sense, I know in Valentine they are bribing the lawmen and that’s probably why they are immune to laws. Same with Bronte’s men in Saint Denis.
    But then you shouldn’t lose honour for killing the law, but there’s a lot of things in the game that don’t make sense. Like you kill fucking loads of law during missions, I guess because it was such a dire situation that you had to. But you can get yourself into equally fucked situations where you have to kill law in the free roam and you’ll lose honour.
        The 1 thing that I hate about RDR2 is that you’re not allowed into Blackwater and New Austin as Arthur, you get killed by an invisible sniper. 

It makes no sense since you massacre a lot of people in Strawberry, Valentine, Rhodes and Saint Denis and you’re allowed to roam the surrounding area without an invisible sniper.
            I don't know why they didn't make the whole map available to Arthur tbh, it's cool going there as John but A.There's not much to do and I get bored of exploring and doing challenges without missions inbetween, and B. It doesn't make sense to go as John because in RDR1 he says he's never been to New Austin
                [deleted]
                    Definitely not, I think it's cause you spend so much time as him and get attached. Plus he's just way better looking and cooler than John
Samé with lemoyne raiders who harass you in rhodes or sometimes in saint Denis

I hate how hard it is to get honor but when you defend yourself from someone you instantly lose All that hardly earned honor
Honor is broken mess of a system that needs to go.
    Why judge a subtle, nuanced character by a binary good-evil metric, at all?
        The idea is that you know killing is bad. Being dishonorable isn't necessarily you being an evil asshole, it just means you're partaking in the act of murder and for that people look down on you.
        I think it’s deliberately a representation of how you’re seen by the world, not an actual judge of Arthur’s nuanced character. There’s times you’re forced into good or bad things even though your honor should reflect otherwise. 

Hence the cheaper shop prices and such. NPCs “see” what you do and think you’re a good dude, so they give you a discount. 

The system still has flaws, but looking at it from that angle it makes a bit more sense
            Then why does my honor go down when I murder somebody whether there are witnesses of not?
            My issue is, is how tf does the rest of the world know I killed a lone camper in the middle of nowhere?
I just wanna be able to loot someone I knock out or kill without it being a damn crime is that too much to ask?
Yeah just committing any crime is annoying. It’s funny how you travel so many miles down a road and go past maybe  1 or 2 people but the second you shoot someone the amount of people on the road that comes to pass you makes the LA traffic look like a ghost town
    Oh shit that’s funny cuz it’s true
Alligators. There's a thousands of them outside Saint Denis. I do it every so often to the fuckwit who robbed and raped Arthur. :)
    Hold up, how did I miss Arthur getting raped?
        Close to the tiny church is a house you'll hear the guy before you see him.. Go talk to him and he'll invite you in :)
            Well I at least hope he wines and dines me first lol. Thank you though, I’ll make sure to head out there!
                Good luck!  :D ^^you're ^^gonna ^^need ^^it.
    I always hunt alligators because they’re easy money and most of them are 3 star
        I'm obviously hunting the wrong kind of ancient scaled lizards, because nearly all of my gators are only one star.
            Make sure you're using the correct weapons to kill different species or you will always get 1-2 star drops.
                I know about that, but it certainly doesn't help that they all spawn one star
                    [deleted]
                        It's a trinket that does that.

The legendary ~~deer~~ Buck trinket gives the ability for perfect skins to drop on 2 star animals, not on every drop though.

I don't think I ever saw 1 star go to 3, but I did have a few 2 star corpses give me perfect pelts.
                            Legendary Buck*
            There are those 2 bridges and both have much alligators
    Raped?
them gator came in clutch more times than I care to count, tbh
yes, if you do it "unprovoked". just use a lil bit o Arthur's sass until someone pulls the gun on you. then you are golden. unless it's been patched recently, but I think it should still work
Dont draw first
    But what if I draw them?
        I guess thats a constitutional loophole that allows you to do anything
            I draw my enemies wearing frilly shirts and big hats that are considered a common law fashion faux pas!
    Where'd you get that idea from?

The ability to draw first and shoot a target is the most romanticized cliche in Westerns
        Ever seen a western? Like a very old one. Anyways everytime someone gets shot the shooter always says something like: "he drew first you guysve seen that right? "
            Ya, but the rule is more if he drew first you can't be held accountable because you were defending yourself, it's not just don't shoot first
        And also that cliche is about both waiting for the otjer one to draw first so it counts as self defense but you also have to deal with the delay of your reaction
Atleast you Can harass armadillo as múch as you want they dont attack you

But dont do that to the sick

Or you Can do it if you're just evil or have cheats Turned on
    I turned on cheats for my first playthrough the other day because I wanted Exploding infinite ammo and to deal massive death to cops in Blackwater.

&#x200B;

I wish they had an infinite health cheat though. So my rampage wouldn't need to be interrupted to refill all my cores every few minutes.
    hold up

how does one activate these cheats you speak of
        You go into options and Press triangles (Y if you're on Xbox i think) and idk how on Pc

Its in the bottom right corner
Had a Guy try to start a fist fight in Van Horn because Arthur greeted him on the way to the baths I ignored him sent arthur on into the bath. I heard shots and some angry sounds outside and came out of the bath about 4 minutes later to the half the town dead include most the shopkeepers who were all replaced with the shops still open. What even is that place.
    Seriously, I confronted a robber who stole 500 dollars from me I tackled him and got my money back, and everyone there just started shooting at me, fuck Van Horn
        The guy actually stole 600 dollars if im correct but only gave you 500

Atleast in saint Denis they let you hogtie and loot the gun shop robber
            I took him to a secluded spot, killed him looted him and then got the 100
        They fixed this now, if you don’t shoot and loot him nobody bats an eye
            I did it away from everybody so this might be why
I watched a video on that, and apparently, the mask and the clothes swapping are only so random citizens can't identify you.

The idea is that you go in, rob a store or something, and bug out before the cops can get there, and you can get away Scott-free.
    Can confirm, this works. Still sucks that you ALWAYS get recognized when robbing a train.
        Yes this is so annoying like how would they be able to tell
So I’m pretty sure the way it works is that if you wear a mask while committing a crime, the NPC’s won’t be able to recognize you. However, the law can see straight through the mask and will know it’s you while committing a crime or if they come because a crime was reported. But if you wear a mask in front of the law while wanted and not committing any crime, I don’t think they recognize you then as long as you keep it moving. I’m not 100% sure on this but this is what I’ve noticed.
I had no idea? Where is this and where do i find them?
    Near trapper in emerald ranch I think I don’t know anymore but there’s an camper who gives you free stuff (for which you will loose bounty)
But he says those were nice folks but the next day someon told him to stay away from that placd
        Ahhh is this the couple at aberdeen pig farm? If i remember1 rightly someone did say something about them being an incest couple lol. I tend to just shoot the guy then run over the lady with my horse now since the first time i played and came across them, the put something in the food they gave me and took my money. Had to go back for it and killed them both.
            that guy lives nowhere near a town. how did you get him to shot a town + sheriff
                The old MMO Art of Kiting
            If you play again, hogtie the woman and take her to where you woke up after being robbed. She says some weird shit. :)
                Recently i've taken to hog tieing o driscolls and letting a train run them over... lmao
            They have their use though. >!Have nearly dead Arthur get robbed just before the last mission as him, leave without getting revenge, and come back as John to get all of Arthur's money back!<
I’ve tried killing lots of npcs randomly and overall I have almost max honor.
Love the Viking Axe
    I found it while doing that Crazy scientist quest near the wolf boy then I tried hunting The legendary elk but couldn’t find clues so I ran along the train tracks then on the train tracks till I found another legendary animal an Wolf near some geysir‘s which look very much like the ones on the jackhammer gang treasure map so I was on an roll
Still couldn’t find the treasure though (don’t like watching youtube bc spoilers)
        Did you get the comb and the helmet from the viking burial site as well.
            Yea but I still haven’t found that wolf boy he ran away twice but normally he should be in his cave which never happened to me
                He is a bit weird I ran into him 3 or 4 times before it acted right. I did end up killing him and his wolves, but it felt bad.
                    I don’t really wanna kill him because if you shoot the wolves he will cry and won’t really defend himself anymore it’s really sad
                        He actually jumped me on my way out of the cave after I killed the wolves.
                            It‘s said that it’s the blacksmith son the one from Rhodes who has an guy locked up in his basement
The Lancaster weapon is by far my favorite the one in his basement
How is the source comment 53 years old? At least that's what it tells me
    The game is 100 years old by now, dang I feel old.
Just spam hello to every citizen you see as you quest and as long as you don't go on any murder sprees you can easily stay at max for the whole game.

Also, always donate to the monk, and you will have no problems.
    I mostly do side mission before continuing the story
Whispering to your horse after murdering a whole town, “shhh they bad we good shhhh”. Lmao
Yeah I figured that out eventually, missed the hat a lot while I didn't know that though.
    I figured it out after picking up every hat hat looked cool when I loose my hat
All the time.
    Nice
Oh I have I just thought you were talking about online.
No I know it's a joke bc some people get so upset abt that
    It’s just mildly annoying that if you greet 1 thousand people you get 1 more honor level hit 5 people you loose an level
        No I know been that's actually the point of the game. Ur supposed to kinda have low honor in the beginning of the game and it's hard to get it up and easy to lose it. But then towards the end there are a lot more options to get high honor and it gives u more per nice thing you do. I suppose it bc at the beginning they are just this mean gang and they are killing and robbing everyone but towards the end he kind of realizes that Dutch isn't doing the right thing and that times are changing and his time is coming to an end and he wants to change his ways
            I am honor level 7 in 5th chapter and max level is 8
                I mean in chapter 6 more so bc i just got to chapter 6 with the absolute lowest honor and after an hour or two of playing I got to max honor no joke
                    Oh ok I’ll try thanks
                        Yeah the beginning of the game is meant to be played with low honor since every mission and activity is bad. In the final chapter Arthur tries to become a better person so you have more options for honor.
For the future, if you hogtie them you can peacefully leave without loosing honor, or if you do want to kill them, just lasso them and drag them into the campfire, they burn and die but you dont loose honor.
    Thanks
Honestly you provoked him enough to feel threatened enough to defend himself. I mean obviously in that situation it’s killed or be killed but a majority of the time you started the altercation so the game is basically saying they didn’t need to die but you made it so you’d have to kill them.
Until the street urchin gets the feds on you for no reason...
    I will never forget my first day in Saint Denis. I was literally a tourist, only taking photos, saying hi to everyone, buying a new suit. Then, I was in the park, minding my own business when suddenly someone started stabbing me. It was the hobo guy and he attacked me right in front of the officer. After a few secs of confusion I tackled him and knocked him out. Then the officer held a gun at me. Long story short, I ran away from the city, taking out every fucking star on my way.
        That’s insane because I literally threw a tomahawk, in broad daylight, police officer probably ten feet away looking at me, at the dude preaching about eugenics and no one blinked an eye.
            you can also tie him up and put him on a horse and feed him to gators and won’t lose honor
                Hold my health tonic I’m starting over part four lmao
                    i personal chose to carry him all the way to a bear spawn in the west grizzlies, let him get yeeted by the bear, get the bear to leave, then took his corpse to the top of hagen and watch him roll down the sheerest cliff i could find
                    [deleted]
                        He comes back too
                    I wish you could it’s the best chapter somewhat
                Can this he done to all preachers? The guy in Strawberry really grinds my gears. Would love to tie him up and feed him to the bears.
                It doesnt feel as good as doing it to the suffragettes tho
                    We got an edgelord here
                        Dont forget to downvote
                    based
            He's the only civilian NPC that can be killed with no consequences. Maybe the klansmen too but they were in a remote area when I committed that happy little massacre.
                You don't even need to kill them. The KKK encounters normally end up bad for them anyways on their own.

No joke, if you haven't watched all 4(?) all the way through you need to.
                    I remember the first time I came across a klan meeting, I watched it play out a little then got tired of it and threw dynamite at them and shot the stragglers. I got +20 health exp for every kill too, thing is I couldn't replicate the exp gain after that which is kinda weird. Not sure why I got exp that one time and that time only but I thought it was some kind of reward for killing them? So I just assumed that you were supposed to intervene and kill them yourself.
                    My only regret is that I couldn’t kill more of them
            You actually don't get any punishment whatsoever for killing him as far as I have heard
            Justified.
                PuRe iS bEtTeR
            when I shot that guy, I got a 5$ bounty for "disturbing the peace"
                You're supposed to throw a tomahawk, it's quieter.
                    Hey, you can murder him as brutally as you like, but don't make a scene!
                    I've given him both barrels of a double barrel shotgun straight to the head, cop standing nearby and got away with it. Many times.
                        You obviously use his head as a silencer, thus not disturbing the peace.
            Yeah, I've disintegrated that racist piece of shit's head many times, had a pleasant conversation with the officer standing 20 feet away, then gone on my merry way saying hi to folks. Never gets any less satisfying.
                Does he respawn?
                    I hope so. I think he does
                        Lmao the first time I killed him was so bland? Hopefully I see his dumbfuck face again— already planning a good murder :p
            If you antagonize the eugenics guy enough he calls you a fool, and you can beat the shit out of him with no consequences, but because he keeps respawning you can keep beating him without saying anything with no consequence, even when a cop is directly next to you
                Once Arthur goes “I’ll show you a fool!” or whatever it was and he starts to run away, I kited his escape down to the boat docks. He paused a bit when he got to the end of one and I just barreled into him and knocked him off the edge. No tackle or push, just a collision. After he falls in and dies Arthur said “sorry bout that, don’t know what’s gotten into me today”
            Yeah, the cops turn a blind eye to anything you do to eugenics guy. Which is awesome. Fuck that guy
            Yeah the cops don't care about that guy. Rockstar did a good with that one. There's always an officer about 20 feet away from him, and I always beat the shit out of him. 

10/10 would beat the shit out of that racist POS again.
                I beat the shit out of him once and the officer just nodded and walked away.
                I think the game wants you to kill racists. You don’t lose honour for murdering the klan and the eugenics guy and you gain honour for putting that paddy roller piece of shit out of his misery
            Yeah, it seems to be pretty hit and miss. I had a guy pickpocket me while walking into the tailor the other day, so I shot him in the leg to slow him down so I could catch him. Well, I guess my pistol was too powerful, because he died on the spot in front of a dozen witnesses. Looted him for double what he stole and not a drop of honor was lost and people didn’t even gasp or comment. Walked straight back to the tailor like nothing ever happened.
            Just as every cop is a criminal, all the sinners are saints
            yeah you can blast his head off with a shotgun and the officer won’t care lol
            The whole town hates him
        I murdered the neo-nazi and the police officer standing 10 feet away did nothing
            Justified.
                That’s what I thought
            How can he be a neo-nazi in 1899 before the first Nazis existed?
                Paleo-nazi?
            Neo nazi in 1899? You know what a neo nazi is, right?
        I turned in a bounty at saint denis sheriff's office and when I walked out the door, the door swung open hitting a police officer. He fell to the ground and I was wanted for assaulting a cop.
        Man my first day in Saint Denis I was robbed in an alleyway by some dude in overalls. Chased him out onto the street, tackled and hog tied him. When I searched him to get my money back the cops came after me. Didn’t end well for anyone
            I think the honour system is rather inconsistent in that regard then. Something similar happened to me, I was pickpocketed by a young lad. I ran after him and tackled him, finally getting my money back. No one said a word, no police intervention whatsoever.
        I loved this story. Fuck I love this game!!!!
        Sort of same experience here. I just began playing the game and I think I was in chapter 2 or 3. I just hopped on a moving train bc I could and I was bored, so this train went to a part of the map I haven’t discovered yet. I WAS SHOOK. I thought “damn where did this come from?!” When I hopped of the train I just started walking and exploring what the heck this city was. Then I hit someone accidentally, and the whole saint denis police department came after me. I also thought that after the game had ended, you could hop on a boat in Saint Denis and go to Guarma, but unfortunately for me it wasn’t the case
The problem is you have to greet 3 people for 1 honor but hit 1 guy for 1 less honor
Oh wow, I thought I was the only one. Spent about 6 hours on a vacation day last week just greeting people in St. Denis. 

Despite being cooped up indoors all day and all week during a pandemic, that day was a good mental health day for the Bankseu, most definitely.
I once antagonized a coachman. John just said 'Boo!'. I got a 10$ bounty for disturbing the peace
I accidentally shot a dog in the Heartlands, instant karma drop, and I also felt like shit.

I still think about that good boy/girl, ugh...
    In the first Mission in valentine (complete noob) I started running faster but didn’t knew how to slow down and ran over an dog I felt so bad I restarted the mission
        You made the right decision!
            Wow, guess I’m pure evil
                You kill innocent pets in the game?
                    What an monster
                    Nope, but I kill every single human I see
                        That's fine.
    I accidentally punted a chicken in saint denis. Needless to say it escalated very quickly.
    You mean good BOAHHH*
1 fish thrown back = one senseless murder forgiven
Every day just throw a few back!
Yeah, thats almost one of the easter eggs of the game :P
I just lassoed him. Took him out of the city to a gator nest. No one said a word. Except him. He said that “we should be sticking together”
But then you shouldn’t lose honour for killing the law, but there’s a lot of things in the game that don’t make sense.

                Definitely not, I think it's cause you spend so much time as him and get attached. Plus he's just way better looking and cooler than John
Why judge a subtle, nuanced character by a binary good-evil metric, at all?
    The idea is that you know killing is bad. Being dishonorable isn't necessarily you being an evil asshole, it just means you're partaking in the act of murder and for that people look down on you.
    I think it’s deliberately a representation of how you’re seen by the world, not an actual judge of Arthur’s nuanced character. There’s times you’re forced into good or bad things even though your honor should reflect otherwise. 

Hence the cheaper shop prices and such. NPCs “see” what you do and think you’re a good dude, so they give you a discount. 

The system still has flaws, but looking at it from that angle it makes a bit more sense

        My issue is, is how tf does the rest of the world know I killed a lone camper in the middle of nowhere?
Oh shit that’s funny cuz it’s true
Hold up, how did I miss Arthur getting raped?
    Close to the tiny church is a house you'll hear the guy before you see him.. Go talk to him and he'll invite you in :)
        Well I at least hope he wines and dines me first lol. Thank you though, I’ll make sure to head out there!

            The old MMO Art of Kiting
        If you play again, hogtie the woman and take her to where you woke up after being robbed. She says some weird shit. :)
            Recently i've taken to hog tieing o driscolls and letting a train run them over... lmao
        They have their use though. >!Have nearly dead Arthur get robbed just before the last mission as him, leave without getting revenge, and come back as John to get all of Arthur's money back!<
I found it while doing that Crazy scientist quest near the wolf boy then I tried hunting The legendary elk but couldn’t find clues so I ran along the train tracks then on the train tracks till I found another legendary animal an Wolf near some geysir‘s which look very much like the ones on the jackhammer gang treasure map so I was on an roll
Still couldn’t find the treasure though (don’t like watching youtube bc spoilers)
    Did you get the comb and the helmet from the viking burial site as well.
        Yea but I still haven’t found that wolf boy he ran away twice but normally he should be in his cave which never happened to me
            He is a bit weird I ran into him 3 or 4 times before it acted right. I did end up killing him and his wolves, but it felt bad.
                I don’t really wanna kill him because if you shoot the wolves he will cry and won’t really defend himself anymore it’s really sad
                    He actually jumped me on my way out of the cave after I killed the wolves.
                        It‘s said that it’s the blacksmith son the one from Rhodes who has an guy locked up in his basement
The Lancaster weapon is by far my favorite the one in his basement
The game is 100 years old by now, dang I feel old.
I mostly do side mission before continuing the story
I figured it out after picking up every hat hat looked cool when I loose my hat
Nice
It’s just mildly annoying that if you greet 1 thousand people you get 1 more honor level hit 5 people you loose an level
    No I know been that's actually the point of the game. Ur supposed to kinda have low honor in the beginning of the game and it's hard to get it up and easy to lose it. But then towards the end there are a lot more options to get high honor and it gives u more per nice thing you do. I suppose it bc at the beginning they are just this mean gang and they are killing and robbing everyone but towards the end he kind of realizes that Dutch isn't doing the right thing and that times are changing and his time is coming to an end and he wants to change his ways
        I am honor level 7 in 5th chapter and max level is 8
            I mean in chapter 6 more so bc i just got to chapter 6 with the absolute lowest honor and after an hour or two of playing I got to max honor no joke
                Oh ok I’ll try thanks
                    Yeah the beginning of the game is meant to be played with low honor since every mission and activity is bad. In the final chapter Arthur tries to become a better person so you have more options for honor.
Thanks
I will never forget my first day in Saint Denis. I was literally a tourist, only taking photos, saying hi to everyone, buying a new suit. Then, I was in the park, minding my own business when suddenly someone started stabbing me. It was the hobo guy and he attacked me right in front of the officer. After a few secs of confusion I tackled him and knocked him out. Then the officer held a gun at me. Long story short, I ran away from the city, taking out every fucking star on my way.
    That’s insane because I literally threw a tomahawk, in broad daylight, police officer probably ten feet away looking at me, at the dude preaching about eugenics and no one blinked an eye.
        you can also tie him up and put him on a horse and feed him to gators and won’t lose honor
            Hold my health tonic I’m starting over part four lmao
                i personal chose to carry him all the way to a bear spawn in the west grizzlies, let him get yeeted by the bear, get the bear to leave, then took his corpse to the top of hagen and watch him roll down the sheerest cliff i could find
                [deleted]
                    He comes back too
                I wish you could it’s the best chapter somewhat
            Can this he done to all preachers? The guy in Strawberry really grinds my gears. Would love to tie him up and feed him to the bears.
            It doesnt feel as good as doing it to the suffragettes tho
                We got an edgelord here
                    Dont forget to downvote
                based
        He's the only civilian NPC that can be killed with no consequences. Maybe the klansmen too but they were in a remote area when I committed that happy little massacre.
            You don't even need to kill them. The KKK encounters normally end up bad for them anyways on their own.

No joke, if you haven't watched all 4(?) all the way through you need to.
                I remember the first time I came across a klan meeting, I watched it play out a little then got tired of it and threw dynamite at them and shot the stragglers. I got +20 health exp for every kill too, thing is I couldn't replicate the exp gain after that which is kinda weird. Not sure why I got exp that one time and that time only but I thought it was some kind of reward for killing them? So I just assumed that you were supposed to intervene and kill them yourself.
                My only regret is that I couldn’t kill more of them
        You actually don't get any punishment whatsoever for killing him as far as I have heard
        Justified.
            PuRe iS bEtTeR
        when I shot that guy, I got a 5$ bounty for "disturbing the peace"
            You're supposed to throw a tomahawk, it's quieter.
                Hey, you can murder him as brutally as you like, but don't make a scene!
                I've given him both barrels of a double barrel shotgun straight to the head, cop standing nearby and got away with it. Many times.
                    You obviously use his head as a silencer, thus not disturbing the peace.
        Yeah, I've disintegrated that racist piece of shit's head many times, had a pleasant conversation with the officer standing 20 feet away, then gone on my merry way saying hi to folks. Never gets any less satisfying.
            Does he respawn?
                I hope so. I think he does
                    Lmao the first time I killed him was so bland? Hopefully I see his dumbfuck face again— already planning a good murder :p
        If you antagonize the eugenics guy enough he calls you a fool, and you can beat the shit out of him with no consequences, but because he keeps respawning you can keep beating him without saying anything with no consequence, even when a cop is directly next to you
            Once Arthur goes “I’ll show you a fool!” or whatever it was and he starts to run away, I kited his escape down to the boat docks. He paused a bit when he got to the end of one and I just barreled into him and knocked him off the edge. No tackle or push, just a collision. After he falls in and dies Arthur said “sorry bout that, don’t know what’s gotten into me today”
        Yeah, the cops turn a blind eye to anything you do to eugenics guy. Which is awesome. Fuck that guy
        Yeah the cops don't care about that guy. Rockstar did a good with that one. There's always an officer about 20 feet away from him, and I always beat the shit out of him. 

10/10 would beat the shit out of that racist POS again.
            I beat the shit out of him once and the officer just nodded and walked away.
            I think the game wants you to kill racists. You don’t lose honour for murdering the klan and the eugenics guy and you gain honour for putting that paddy roller piece of shit out of his misery
        Yeah, it seems to be pretty hit and miss. I had a guy pickpocket me while walking into the tailor the other day, so I shot him in the leg to slow him down so I could catch him. Well, I guess my pistol was too powerful, because he died on the spot in front of a dozen witnesses. Looted him for double what he stole and not a drop of honor was lost and people didn’t even gasp or comment. Walked straight back to the tailor like nothing ever happened.
        Just as every cop is a criminal, all the sinners are saints
        yeah you can blast his head off with a shotgun and the officer won’t care lol
        The whole town hates him
    I murdered the neo-nazi and the police officer standing 10 feet away did nothing
        Justified.
            That’s what I thought
        How can he be a neo-nazi in 1899 before the first Nazis existed?
            Paleo-nazi?
        Neo nazi in 1899? You know what a neo nazi is, right?
    I turned in a bounty at saint denis sheriff's office and when I walked out the door, the door swung open hitting a police officer. He fell to the ground and I was wanted for assaulting a cop.
    Man my first day in Saint Denis I was robbed in an alleyway by some dude in overalls. Chased him out onto the street, tackled and hog tied him. When I searched him to get my money back the cops came after me. Didn’t end well for anyone
        I think the honour system is rather inconsistent in that regard then. Something similar happened to me, I was pickpocketed by a young lad. I ran after him and tackled him, finally getting my money back. No one said a word, no police intervention whatsoever.
    I loved this story. Fuck I love this game!!!!
    Sort of same experience here. I just began playing the game and I think I was in chapter 2 or 3. I just hopped on a moving train bc I could and I was bored, so this train went to a part of the map I haven’t discovered yet. I WAS SHOOK. I thought “damn where did this come from?!” When I hopped of the train I just started walking and exploring what the heck this city was. Then I hit someone accidentally, and the whole saint denis police department came after me. I also thought that after the game had ended, you could hop on a boat in Saint Denis and go to Guarma, but unfortunately for me it wasn’t the case
In the first Mission in valentine (complete noob) I started running faster but didn’t knew how to slow down and ran over an dog I felt so bad I restarted the mission
    You made the right decision!
        Wow, guess I’m pure evil
            You kill innocent pets in the game?
                What an monster
                Nope, but I kill every single human I see
                    That's fine.
I accidentally punted a chicken in saint denis. Needless to say it escalated very quickly.
You mean good BOAHHH*
The 1 thing that I hate about RDR2 is that you’re not allowed into Blackwater and New Austin as Arthur, you get killed by an invisible sniper. 

It makes no sense since you massacre a lot of people in Strawberry, Valentine, Rhodes and Saint Denis and you’re allowed to roam the surrounding area without an invisible sniper.
    I don't know why they didn't make the whole map available to Arthur tbh, it's cool going there as John but A.There's not much to do and I get bored of exploring and doing challenges without missions inbetween, and B. It doesn't make sense to go as John because in RDR1 he says he's never been to New Austin
        [deleted]
            Definitely not, I think it's cause you spend so much time as him and get attached. Plus he's just way better looking and cooler than John
The idea is that you know killing is bad. Being dishonorable isn't necessarily you being an evil asshole, it just means you're partaking in the act of murder and for that people look down on you.
I think it’s deliberately a representation of how you’re seen by the world, not an actual judge of Arthur’s nuanced character. There’s times you’re forced into good or bad things even though your honor should reflect otherwise. 

Hence the cheaper shop prices and such. NPCs “see” what you do and think you’re a good dude, so they give you a discount. 

The system still has flaws, but looking at it from that angle it makes a bit more sense
    Then why does my honor go down when I murder somebody whether there are witnesses of not?
    My issue is, is how tf does the rest of the world know I killed a lone camper in the middle of nowhere?
Close to the tiny church is a house you'll hear the guy before you see him.. Go talk to him and he'll invite you in :)
    Well I at least hope he wines and dines me first lol. Thank you though, I’ll make sure to head out there!
        Good luck!  :D ^^you're ^^gonna ^^need ^^it.
I'm obviously hunting the wrong kind of ancient scaled lizards, because nearly all of my gators are only one star.
    Make sure you're using the correct weapons to kill different species or you will always get 1-2 star drops.
        I know about that, but it certainly doesn't help that they all spawn one star
            [deleted]
                It's a trinket that does that.

The legendary ~~deer~~ Buck trinket gives the ability for perfect skins to drop on 2 star animals, not on every drop though.

I don't think I ever saw 1 star go to 3, but I did have a few 2 star corpses give me perfect pelts.
                    Legendary Buck*
    There are those 2 bridges and both have much alligators
I guess thats a constitutional loophole that allows you to do anything
    I draw my enemies wearing frilly shirts and big hats that are considered a common law fashion faux pas!
Ever seen a western? Like a very old one. Anyways everytime someone gets shot the shooter always says something like: "he drew first you guysve seen that right? "
    Ya, but the rule is more if he drew first you can't be held accountable because you were defending yourself, it's not just don't shoot first
And also that cliche is about both waiting for the otjer one to draw first so it counts as self defense but you also have to deal with the delay of your reaction
You go into options and Press triangles (Y if you're on Xbox i think) and idk how on Pc

Its in the bottom right corner
The guy actually stole 600 dollars if im correct but only gave you 500

Atleast in saint Denis they let you hogtie and loot the gun shop robber
    I took him to a secluded spot, killed him looted him and then got the 100
They fixed this now, if you don’t shoot and loot him nobody bats an eye
    I did it away from everybody so this might be why
Yes this is so annoying like how would they be able to tell
Ahhh is this the couple at aberdeen pig farm? If i remember1 rightly someone did say something about them being an incest couple lol. I tend to just shoot the guy then run over the lady with my horse now since the first time i played and came across them, the put something in the food they gave me and took my money. Had to go back for it and killed them both.
    that guy lives nowhere near a town. how did you get him to shot a town + sheriff

    Can this he done to all preachers? The guy in Strawberry really grinds my gears. Would love to tie him up and feed him to the bears.
    It doesnt feel as good as doing it to the suffragettes tho

He's the only civilian NPC that can be killed with no consequences. Maybe the klansmen too but they were in a remote area when I committed that happy little massacre.
    You don't even need to kill them. The KKK encounters normally end up bad for them anyways on their own.

No joke, if you haven't watched all 4(?) all the way through you need to.
        I remember the first time I came across a klan meeting, I watched it play out a little then got tired of it and threw dynamite at them and shot the stragglers. I got +20 health exp for every kill too, thing is I couldn't replicate the exp gain after that which is kinda weird. Not sure why I got exp that one time and that time only but I thought it was some kind of reward for killing them? So I just assumed that you were supposed to intervene and kill them yourself.
        My only regret is that I couldn’t kill more of them
You actually don't get any punishment whatsoever for killing him as far as I have heard
Justified.
    PuRe iS bEtTeR
when I shot that guy, I got a 5$ bounty for "disturbing the peace"
    You're supposed to throw a tomahawk, it's quieter.
        Hey, you can murder him as brutally as you like, but don't make a scene!
        I've given him both barrels of a double barrel shotgun straight to the head, cop standing nearby and got away with it. Many times.
            You obviously use his head as a silencer, thus not disturbing the peace.
Yeah, I've disintegrated that racist piece of shit's head many times, had a pleasant conversation with the officer standing 20 feet away, then gone on my merry way saying hi to folks. Never gets any less satisfying.
    Does he respawn?
        I hope so. I think he does
            Lmao the first time I killed him was so bland? Hopefully I see his dumbfuck face again— already planning a good murder :p
If you antagonize the eugenics guy enough he calls you a fool, and you can beat the shit out of him with no consequences, but because he keeps respawning you can keep beating him without saying anything with no consequence, even when a cop is directly next to you
    Once Arthur goes “I’ll show you a fool!” or whatever it was and he starts to run away, I kited his escape down to the boat docks. He paused a bit when he got to the end of one and I just barreled into him and knocked him off the edge. No tackle or push, just a collision. After he falls in and dies Arthur said “sorry bout that, don’t know what’s gotten into me today”
Yeah, the cops turn a blind eye to anything you do to eugenics guy. Which is awesome. Fuck that guy
Yeah the cops don't care about that guy. Rockstar did a good with that one. There's always an officer about 20 feet away from him, and I always beat the shit out of him. 

10/10 would beat the shit out of that racist POS again.
    I beat the shit out of him once and the officer just nodded and walked away.
    I think the game wants you to kill racists. You don’t lose honour for murdering the klan and the eugenics guy and you gain honour for putting that paddy roller piece of shit out of his misery
Yeah, it seems to be pretty hit and miss. I had a guy pickpocket me while walking into the tailor the other day, so I shot him in the leg to slow him down so I could catch him. Well, I guess my pistol was too powerful, because he died on the spot in front of a dozen witnesses. Looted him for double what he stole and not a drop of honor was lost and people didn’t even gasp or comment. Walked straight back to the tailor like nothing ever happened.
Just as every cop is a criminal, all the sinners are saints
yeah you can blast his head off with a shotgun and the officer won’t care lol
The whole town hates him
Justified.
    That’s what I thought
How can he be a neo-nazi in 1899 before the first Nazis existed?
    Paleo-nazi?
Neo nazi in 1899? You know what a neo nazi is, right?
I think the honour system is rather inconsistent in that regard then. Something similar happened to me, I was pickpocketed by a young lad. I ran after him and tackled him, finally getting my money back. No one said a word, no police intervention whatsoever.
Wow, guess I’m pure evil
    You kill innocent pets in the game?
        What an monster
        Nope, but I kill every single human I see
            That's fine.

    Definitely not, I think it's cause you spend so much time as him and get attached. Plus he's just way better looking and cooler than John
Good luck!  :D ^^you're ^^gonna ^^need ^^it.
I know about that, but it certainly doesn't help that they all spawn one star
    [deleted]
        It's a trinket that does that.

The legendary ~~deer~~ Buck trinket gives the ability for perfect skins to drop on 2 star animals, not on every drop though.

I don't think I ever saw 1 star go to 3, but I did have a few 2 star corpses give me perfect pelts.

The old MMO Art of Kiting
Recently i've taken to hog tieing o driscolls and letting a train run them over... lmao
He is a bit weird I ran into him 3 or 4 times before it acted right. I did end up killing him and his wolves, but it felt bad.
    I don’t really wanna kill him because if you shoot the wolves he will cry and won’t really defend himself anymore it’s really sad
        He actually jumped me on my way out of the cave after I killed the wolves.
            It‘s said that it’s the blacksmith son the one from Rhodes who has an guy locked up in his basement
The Lancaster weapon is by far my favorite the one in his basement
I mean in chapter 6 more so bc i just got to chapter 6 with the absolute lowest honor and after an hour or two of playing I got to max honor no joke
    Oh ok I’ll try thanks
        Yeah the beginning of the game is meant to be played with low honor since every mission and activity is bad. In the final chapter Arthur tries to become a better person so you have more options for honor.
Hold my health tonic I’m starting over part four lmao
    i personal chose to carry him all the way to a bear spawn in the west grizzlies, let him get yeeted by the bear, get the bear to leave, then took his corpse to the top of hagen and watch him roll down the sheerest cliff i could find
