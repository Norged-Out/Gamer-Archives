[[You're my Son Arthur - Dutch van der Linde]]





Hearing him call Arthur his son made me smile, seeing him trust Micah, did not
    Makes you smile a little less when you realize that when he is manipulating Eagle Falls, he starts calling him son right away.

Edit 2: EAGLE. FLIES. His name is eagle flies lol
        i think you mean eagle flies
            Fuck me im tired, edited it thx
                But you didn't tho
                    Come on, man. He‘s tired!
                        Thank you all for your understanding and patience I immediately passed out after doing a shitty edit. It’s fixed now???
                    *LIAR!*
            I think Eagle Falls would be more appropriate considering what happened to him because of Dutch's manipulation.
                i thought it was rains fall
                    That's his father
                        Rains Fly and Eagle Falls
        Dutch really playing Arthur like that 😔
        Eagle Flies, Rains Fall
        Damn. Never noticed that, that’s heavy.
        That eagle did fall I guess
Seriously though micah was only with them for a few months arthur was the first person to join the gang
    It really didn't make much sense why he would be so loyal to such a new member. Especially when all Micah did was fuck shit up and act crazy.
        It just shows that dutch isn’t really that family, loyal man we were thinking he was. He would only allow people who would feed his ego near him. And that shows how much a garbage of a human he actually is.
            Micah was just the one Dutch wanted Arthur to be. The one who helped to put Dutch on the trails was Hosea, but after his death, he approched the one who had a similar view of world, but less restrained.
        My theory is that during the St Denis trolley robbery mission, Dutch hits his head pretty hard during the crash and makes a comment about it, and that’s kind of the beginning of his paranoia and descent into losing everything. I think he gets a concussion and something goes on with his brain that changes him a little.
            This make a lot of sense on the one hand but then on the other hand, the game literally starts in the aftermath of Dutch going a bit crazy and killing a bunch of people! I really enjoyed the story but there were at least a few times where I was like "why are we following this guy?" or regarding Micah: "why are we trusting this guy?" haha
                Perhaps he had a bit of craziness, but he was sane enough to keep it locked up. A concussion is more than enough to break that lock.
                    Hosea getting killed didn't help and that wasn't much later either, he was kind of an achor for Dutch i think.
                        True, Hoesea was his voice of reason. As more of the gang died, and everyone questioning his leadership, it probably all pushed him even more into the crazy. 

He honestly had a lot of stuff piling up on him when I think about it. Still sucks that he ran off with Micah.
                            I think the heart of it is that Dutch wanted what’s best for the Van der Linde gang, Hosea wanted what’s best for the gang members themselves. Comes across time and time again in their interactions with the camp.
                Which is why where I am in the game I'm gonna "hold" for quite awhile because of what's coming next (Hubby is way ahead of me and I watch him play, so I know!!)
                Yeah Arthur makes several comments quite early in the game on the lines of Dutch killing people needlessly or acting strange. It's a nice theory but I think the point is he descended to that point and it wasn't a sudden change.
            Interesting theory!

Still, even at the start he shows Micah a respect that seems out of place for someone so unknown. I noticed in my second playthrough, when they raid the O'driscolls from colter (old friends mission) that he liats Micah first when praising the team he had assembled.

It would be nice to have more depth of the dutch/Micah relationship in the game and what was going on there.
                At some point I believe Micah saves Dutch’s life in a bar fight, hence why Dutch allows him to join and seems to be the only one who actually likes him. I can’t remember where but I think it’s written on a note in camp somewhere.
            Dutch is a narcissistic control freak from the very beginning. He didn't "go crazy" he just got put in a place where his plans weren't for the best of the gang anymore and Arthur could see that. The whole gang starts to lose faith in Dutch because it's clear he no longer wants what's best for them he just wants to live the outlaw life by any means. Then Arthur starts disagreeing with him and he he can't handle that, again because he's a narcissist, so he turns on Arthur and anyone who doesn't have "faith." Dutch was only ever in it for himself, it's just he used to be able to sell it as being beneficial for everyone. But he was only using the gang to live the life he wanted to live.
            I like this theory. Would be quite realistic as Dutch isn't so jolly after this.
                Got some CTE in Saint Denis
            He was always egotistical and fed into whoever inflated his already overgrown ego. The concussion just made it more obvious. It also made him irritable, paranoid, and have a shorter fuse. He already had those issues but this just added to it
                Yeah exactly, I think he was already heading down that path but the concussion just exacerbated it, why it feels like the second half just spirals.
            My thoughts exactly. But also I think his sudden instability is a litany of things. Concussion, what happened after the bank in Saint Denis, and Guarama. It was the perfect storm to push an eccentric, but reasonable, man over the edge. I'm still curious where his loyalty to Micah came from, sometimes while playing I felt like he had dirt on Dutch or something. Or it could be, somewhere deep down, Dutch knew that this little family they created wasn't sustainable and thought things would go more according to plan if they doubled down on being outlaws instead of community and Micah was the epitome of that. I also can't help but wonder if Micah was some sort of double agent, I mean his love for Dutch does seem genuine but maybe a *little* forced? And he seems to purposefully be pushing Dutch over the brink again and again with seemingly no concern for his stability.
                Dude micah was literally a Pinkerton informant pretty sure agent milton said so. They picked up Micah before he met dutch and set up the whole thing in exchange for his freedom he had to help them take down the gang same deal as john in rd1. How else do you think the pinkertons always knew where they were and managed to ambush them at every major heist including Blackwater, which was shortly after he joined the gang.
                    Micah didn’t become an informant until the gang gets back from Guarma, it was actually kinda late in the story it happened.
                        If you poke around his hide out near Strawberry, you can find a bounty poster for Dutch with a $1000 price on him. Wouldn’t be surprised if he’d had similar intentions all along.
                        Supposedly, someone had to be tipping them off for them to show up to every other major score and every single camp site
                    Honestly? Because ever decision they made for whole game was objectively terrible. They constantly had eyes on them, made way too much noise weather Micah was there or not. And just overall did everything wrong.  He who lives by the sword dies by it
                        If you look at it most of the noise before the trolly robbery was either micah himself, advocated by micah or something that would have been relatively quiet if the law hadn't miraculously showed up. Hell the only thing that let the pinkertons know what direction they went out of the grizzlys was micah's massacre of strawberry and this led to the shootout at valentine with Cornwall. Without that event they wouldnt have had to move to lemoyne and get involved with the grays and that business. If strawberry hadn't happened they could have laid low at horseshoe and done their scams around town and pulled off a minor bank robbery without the added alert the Cornwall shootout and continued west like they planned. After blackwater feat micah and strawberries their fate was sealed as permanently rapidly moving and losing men with no time to think.
            I'm pretty sure it started in blackwater because Dutch has been a outlaw for over 20 years. But I suggest you replay the story and take it as slow as possible because in chapter 2 he was questioning my faith
            I always that the Bank Roberry was the turning point.
            That theory has been around for a long time. Dutch did what he did because Micah sucked him off non stop, even when he fucked up. It's not that complicated
        Micah knew how to kiss Dutch’s ass. He was a brown nosing suck up.
            Is that why they're almost always together at the Beaver Hollow camp? I go over and antagonize them (or at least Micah, one time I antagonized Dutch too and he shoved me) just to break it up.
                Yeah, in the last chapter they’re never too far apart.
                    Saw Micah with his head down next to Dutch's, whispering and gesturing quite a lot but when I moved closer I couldn't hear anything and Micah jerked upright and told me off for being nosy.  Soon as I walk away, he's back at it again.
                        Sounds about right
        I think it's shown well that Micah is manipulating him, but I think it happened to early on
            Manipulation made effective by the fact that it’s what Dutch *wants* to hear. He wants blind loyalty mixed with a passionate hate for whoever goes against the gang in any way, shape, or form.
        Because Micah told Dutch what he wanted to hear, not what he needed to hear.
        It makes a lot of sense if you even remotely understand Dutch. Micah told Dutch what he wanted to hear, Dutch is a narcissist, ergo: Dutch trusts Micah.
        Well Micah was a very manipulative bastard. He knew how to jerk Dutch off just right. He always agreed with Dutch no matter how stupid his ideas were and Arthur would always be against it.
        Yeah, shit talkers and back stabbers are really good at what they do, especially if their target isn't a shit talking backstabber.
        Narcissistic manipulation. Dutch trusted him because he sold a good lie, he would have cut Dutch off when he wasn’t useful anymore
        Because Micah told him what he wanted to hear and didn’t try and tell him the truth like Arthur or Hosea. Dutch is a classic narcissist who’s just very charismatic.
    Michah was the only one that didn't question Dutch's decisions on a regular basis. John, Hosea, and Arthur all started showing their doubts in Dutch's behavior. John especially if you pay attention to a lot of their dialog. That's why Dutch leaves him to die several times
        That's the other thing, Dutch clearly leaves both John and Arthur to die, but the story doesn't seem to develop upon the reason why.

I was fully expecting some kind of agenda there, some kind of reveal that never came.
            The reason is the same reason I just said. Their loyalty comes into question and Dutch is a dick. That was right after Dutch learned Arthur was, "doing things behind his back" and he felt betrayed. 

Betrayal+being a massive throbbing penis= leaving your best friend of 20 years to die
                Yep, I could see that being the case, I just wish there was a deeper reasoning. He's a pretty fleshed out character, especially what with RD1, it would be nice if they had some more depth.
                    I think it's just piece of a larger puzzle. The reason isn't that deep bc there's more than one reason. 

Plus I feel like a lot of the story telling is done in side content that could be easily missed. Like camp conversations between characters is super easy to miss but that's where you get a lot of the explanation as to why the gang members do what they do
                        True that - I'm only on my second playthrough now and I'm making a point to pay more attention to that kinda stuff
                    >Yep, I could see that being the case, I just wish there was a deeper reasoning.

I think that's the point. Dutch sells himself as some kind of revolutionary who wants to build a better word, but really he's just a thief and murderer with delusions of grandeur.
                    It’s always seemed to me to be a really hard thing to model a fight in which one character could clearly save the other but doesn’t. Like it’s a moment that could pass by before you even see it. By making it long and drawn out it’s easier to show but I’ve always pictured the moment of Dutch leaving Arthur to die was a split second decision that came without thinking deep within.
            It doesn't need to. Dutch is a narcissistic control freak. He needs control, he needs yes men. If you don't agree with him you're against him. So he throws them away.
            If rdr3 release they need to explore dutch’s character much deeper
                Perhaps if they did a pre-prequel and explore the gang when Arthur joined 15 to 20 years prior to RD2 - that would be awesome to see. Maybe playing as Hosea.
                    My guess is they'd give us the year that John went m.i.a. from the gang. Did they ever say what he was up to for that year?
                    If we’re going by how the other games played out where the main character dies we can’t play as Hosea until the epilogue.
                    Hosea gets my vote as well, though I wouldn't mind learning more about Lenny's father's story.
    The first person to join the gang was Hosea, but I definitely see what you mean, I think he was the second person to join the gang.
        Well hosea and ditch were kinda partners in the beginning then ince more people joined ditch became leader
            True. So he was kinda the first person so join, well. Fall into the gang, he had no choice. Most of the gang members I think were orphans.
    Hosea was the first
        Him and dutch met and became partners dutch became sole leader later on but for a while they were partners therefore arthur was the first
    I'm pretty sure it was actually Hosea but the point still stands
Micah didn’t pull the wool over the eyes of Dutch those few months Micah joined the gang, Dutch pulled the wool over the eyes of his gang for years about the type of person he was.
    Yeah, Arthur and John discuss that a few times - questioning whether it’s Dutch who changed, or if they’re just now seeing him for who he’s always been. Could be a little of both, but he was definitely a master of manipulation!
    And that is the lesson everyone should take from the story because it happens in the real world all the time. I've seen it myself with my boss and Co employee and the co looks and sounds just like Micah.  It's quite chilling actually.  It's like the writers worked next to me and I never knew it
        Fuck your kissass coworker
            Best part is he was recently promoted to another location and everyone there says he's a great guy.
                Cant's spell great with r-a-t.
                `>:(`
    I've never actually thought about it like that
That artwork makes me want to see a whole animated series about the Van Der Linda Gang!
    Why has this not been done already?
        Because movies/TV series of video games unfortunately often end up crap
            Wouldn't say that 
Witcher is pretty cool tbh
                It was also a book so in that retrospect they also had the books to help but generally they’re right look at P5 the animation
                I think Witcher was an outlier, the assassin's creed movie, tomb raider movie and the resident evil movies all sucked
                They didn't say that they ALWAYS end up terrible, just that they "often do", and they do...we all know it lol.

Rarely there's a good one here or there, but the majority tend to be awful.

Not that it matters or anyone cares, but I really enjoyed the Witcher on Netflix.  One of the rare videogame-based gems for sho.
            Cyberpunk Edgerunner has entered the chat
        I guess people dont want to spend money on something if they're not sure it will be a hit ? ): 

They just need to HAVE SOME FAITH!!
            Like you say they just gotta have a little faith. 

I would personally love this and if they pulled it off right it could become massive. 

I really hope they do although I suppose it may use up content which they plan to use in a future next gake

We can't always fight nature. We can't fight change. We can't fight gravity. We can't fight nothing, except rockstar not making a RDR cartoon series, which would be awesome.
            Read that last bit in Dutch's voice lol
    Giving me Iron Giant vibes
        Hog Hug...?
I have a plan dammit
    Just one more score
        We’ll be collecting MANGOES in TAHITI
All we need is a little muneh, one more solid job.
Micah: Shoots ms gremshaw right in front of Dutch and has a gun pointed at Arthur 

Dutch: Alright who is with me and who is against me
    Yeah you would think that Micah literally shooting Dutch's previous girlfriend and one of the first gang members, would make Dutch demonise Micah and hate him, but nah apparently not.
        the more people alive in the end, more people to share the gold with.
        Grimshaw was beginning to question Dutch's decisions therefore she was 'disloyal' and deserved it.  


I'm sure Dutch objected at some point and Micah spun a story of how actually everyone in the gang but Micah was a rat the whole time.
    SERIOUSLY THOUGH, he shoots her dead and he doesn't even flinch, like Christ.
i'd kill that 🖤sshole ten times over again if i had the chance
    Lol I’ve tried so many times the game won’t let ya lol
        to be honest the only reason i'm replaying the story again is to be an arse to micah and to kill him again🥰
            I don’t know if I would totally replay it but I do have a save after the riverboat before Arthur’s sickness gets worse In saint denis... I like Arthur way more than john lol
If only Hosea didn't die then Micah's manipulation on Dutch would've never work

        Happy Cake Day!
            Thank you
you could at least credit the [artist](https://twitter.com/antoinsaintjust/status/1214701014542159872). 

don't repost without credit. it's shitty.
    Someone give this man an award!
        haha thanks. also i’m a woman
            Lol sorry
                no problem, it happens, it just feels weird not to correct 😅
Micah:

My crew is big and it keeps getting bigger. That's cause VAN FER LINE is my n-
    Van fer line
        The amount of depression I just received from you is immeasurable
“i was gonna say you’re like a son to me arthur, but it’s more than that”🥺🥺
It really gets me the most, he doesn’t trust the person he’s been with since he was around 18, the person who provides all the food, money, and the saddest part is that he doesn’t even bother realizing he’s sick. I think he knows it but he doesn’t care because his mind is made of mangoes.
"All them years, Dutch"
I haven't played in a minute but this still makes me sad
In Dutch’s eyes, Micah never doubted him like Arthur. That’s why it got to him.
No no here is a better description...
Trusting people who have been with you 2 decades who you took care as your own son amd who have never doubted you... Dutch: no

Trusting a random outlaw who has bewn riding with tou a couple months and who has been an asshole to everybody...dutch:yes
    Dutch is a narcissist, Micah knows how to play to him.
    The thing that bothers me about the whole situation is I've been witness to this at my job for real.  My boss and a snake in the grass and the snake looks and sounds EXACTLY like Micah.
Oh the doubting. You just have to keep some faith
Micah and Dutch were lovers. Micah was submissive and it helped Dutch assert dominance in one place while he was losing it in others. Molly thought Dutch was looking at another woman in the group. No. He was all about Micah. Cowboy shit, man.
    And reading it now I’m still laughing today
    Dude wat
        Man I made this post high as shit a year ago. FOH.
Micah is the perfect example of how one bad apple can spoil the bunch. Almost two and a half decades of work, all for virtually nothing because of one selfish opportunistic asshole.
Your art style is exquisite! I love seeing your new comics!!
    He didn’t even make it....
        Oh welp haha
Dutch only cared about people he could manipulate. He was a sociopath and likely psychopath.
I think that dutch was going to micah because everyone else in the gang had at least doubted him before, and micah had only encouraged him to do those things, and deep down I think he regretted what he did and how he let the gang fall apart. I think the reason he was doing all these crazy things because he didn’t know what to do when he failed because he had never failed so greatly that people had started doubting him.
Now we just need dutch realizing he was dumb all along
Micah: *the actual literal worst even considering the general standards for this time period*

Dutch: Ya this is a good person to keep around.
    He even spews some semi racist shit as well

But when Lenny says, in chapter 1, "when you die, the'll be a party"... he was completely right.
        Already knew from the beginning I would want Micah dead. Just the literal worst person, I swear.
Who’s the artist?
He said once “you’re more than a son to me, Arthur”
He bloody raised Arthur and John I still don’t get it
You sir, are a fish. - Arthur Morgan
I’d still take Dutch back after what he did. He realized what he did wrong in the end, now just only if Arthur was still alive...
He looks like a disney prince
Honestly the thing that pissed me off the most with that game is that you didnt get to kill Micah, i wanted to beat the shit out of him, knee cap him and then string him up
this look like the general that tries to break Spirit
(Minor Spoiler) I think Dutch was just really stressed with everything that was going on but after that one robbery in Saint Denis where they took the trolley and Dutch hit his head after it crashed he started to go crazy. Maybe he had some serious brain damage or something idk.
And with good reason to cowpoke.
youre more than that
I'm sure this has been mentioned before...

Last night, I was carrying a bag of feed through Horseshoe Overlook and Dutch approached me. 
He stopped, looked Arthur dead in the eye and said something to the effect of:

"You're going to betray me, aren't you? You seem the type."

As it's my 3rd playthrough, it really pissed me off.  Dutch is lucky Arthur isn't able to throw hands in camp lol.
Spoiler tag please
    Lol

        Good bot
Come on Dutch
Nice art
Its funny because its true😂
It’s easy to listen to someone that’s reinforcing your own delusions.
Honestly, I understand he is portrayed as crazy towards the end, hence why he probably made a “crazy” judgement call, but I just don’t believe it was very realistic for him to side with Micah.

I also would have liked to see how it played out if Hosea was along for the ride until the end
This meme gets posted every week, but does anybody actually consider that the story is just pretty bad?
    You sir or madam have clearly been misinformed
Hey have y’all heard the event when micha called him a “red-skin” and he knocked his ass to the ground
I mean, you listen in camp and it's clear Micah knew a moment like this was coming eventually and has been buttering Dutch up with "i'm the only loyal one and only one smart enough to notice we have a Rat in the gang" for weeks before it happens.
I really loved how Rockstar told the story I think Dutch had reason side with Micah (yeah yeah I know) Hosea died, almost everyone in the camp are leaving,  Pinkertons are after the gang yeah at the end Dutch didn't care for anyone
Remember not only was Hosea Dutch’s best friend for over 20 years but he was the voice of reason.  Arthur started to see Dutch change early in the game (Dutch shooting the woman in the Blackwater ferry robbery kind of starts all this).  Dutch starts to slowly see the three men who have been with him the longest start to question him (Hosea, Arthur and John). Then along comes Micah who basically kisses Dutch’s ass and Dutch starts to believe that someone respects him and then in the end we find out what type of person Micah really is.
Why is it the camp always asking you to fix up Dutch’s tent? I mean it’s not like he does anything other than ask you to do stuff. Hey Dutch, go get your own money🤣🤣🤣
“I’d say you’re like a son to me, but you’re more than that. “ 

- Dutch to Arthur after the ride back to camp from becoming a deputy in Rhodes...
my boy
Fr stupidest crap ever
It started I think when Arther betrayed his order and went to go get John. He constantly undermines Dutch now since his plans are horrible as Dutch is loosing his dam mind over their situation. And Micah uses that to his advantage to manipulate him. So Dutch seeing him as a more loyal member who goes with whatever he says he starts to like Micah more.
Micah the fucking rat : HoW u DoIn BlAcK LuNG
He liked Micah because Micah played him like a god dalm fiddle and basically became Shannon Briggs to Dutches Logan Paul
Oh shit new format

Invest while it’s hot!
Micah ’Brown Nose Rim Licker’ Bell.
All them years dutch
#wheres ur faith
Yo fuck Micah, Straight up.
Someone, give this man a medal!

I won't, because I'm a cheap Dutchman...
Dutch is gay
Yes yes Duch has the best books ever.
 They have gay cowboy sex in their hideout on mount hagen
To be fair, while I completely agree trusting Micah was the wrong move and Arthur had more than earned his trust, you shouldn’t trust people just because they’ve been around you for a long time, base your trust off what’s happened with that person not how long that person has existed in your life 😃
When you're a narcicist, enablers > good people.
Makes you smile a little less when you realize that when he is manipulating Eagle Falls, he starts calling him son right away.

Edit 2: EAGLE. FLIES. His name is eagle flies lol
    i think you mean eagle flies
        Fuck me im tired, edited it thx
            But you didn't tho

                *LIAR!*
        I think Eagle Falls would be more appropriate considering what happened to him because of Dutch's manipulation.
            i thought it was rains fall
                That's his father
                    Rains Fly and Eagle Falls
    Dutch really playing Arthur like that 😔
    Eagle Flies, Rains Fall
    Damn. Never noticed that, that’s heavy.
    That eagle did fall I guess
It really didn't make much sense why he would be so loyal to such a new member. Especially when all Micah did was fuck shit up and act crazy.
    It just shows that dutch isn’t really that family, loyal man we were thinking he was. He would only allow people who would feed his ego near him. And that shows how much a garbage of a human he actually is.
        Micah was just the one Dutch wanted Arthur to be. The one who helped to put Dutch on the trails was Hosea, but after his death, he approched the one who had a similar view of world, but less restrained.
    My theory is that during the St Denis trolley robbery mission, Dutch hits his head pretty hard during the crash and makes a comment about it, and that’s kind of the beginning of his paranoia and descent into losing everything. I think he gets a concussion and something goes on with his brain that changes him a little.
        This make a lot of sense on the one hand but then on the other hand, the game literally starts in the aftermath of Dutch going a bit crazy and killing a bunch of people! I really enjoyed the story but there were at least a few times where I was like "why are we following this guy?" or regarding Micah: "why are we trusting this guy?" haha
            Perhaps he had a bit of craziness, but he was sane enough to keep it locked up. A concussion is more than enough to break that lock.
                Hosea getting killed didn't help and that wasn't much later either, he was kind of an achor for Dutch i think.
                    True, Hoesea was his voice of reason. As more of the gang died, and everyone questioning his leadership, it probably all pushed him even more into the crazy. 

He honestly had a lot of stuff piling up on him when I think about it. Still sucks that he ran off with Micah.
                        I think the heart of it is that Dutch wanted what’s best for the Van der Linde gang, Hosea wanted what’s best for the gang members themselves. Comes across time and time again in their interactions with the camp.
            Which is why where I am in the game I'm gonna "hold" for quite awhile because of what's coming next (Hubby is way ahead of me and I watch him play, so I know!!)
            Yeah Arthur makes several comments quite early in the game on the lines of Dutch killing people needlessly or acting strange. It's a nice theory but I think the point is he descended to that point and it wasn't a sudden change.
        Interesting theory!

Still, even at the start he shows Micah a respect that seems out of place for someone so unknown. I noticed in my second playthrough, when they raid the O'driscolls from colter (old friends mission) that he liats Micah first when praising the team he had assembled.

It would be nice to have more depth of the dutch/Micah relationship in the game and what was going on there.
            At some point I believe Micah saves Dutch’s life in a bar fight, hence why Dutch allows him to join and seems to be the only one who actually likes him. I can’t remember where but I think it’s written on a note in camp somewhere.
        Dutch is a narcissistic control freak from the very beginning. He didn't "go crazy" he just got put in a place where his plans weren't for the best of the gang anymore and Arthur could see that. The whole gang starts to lose faith in Dutch because it's clear he no longer wants what's best for them he just wants to live the outlaw life by any means. Then Arthur starts disagreeing with him and he he can't handle that, again because he's a narcissist, so he turns on Arthur and anyone who doesn't have "faith." Dutch was only ever in it for himself, it's just he used to be able to sell it as being beneficial for everyone. But he was only using the gang to live the life he wanted to live.
        I like this theory. Would be quite realistic as Dutch isn't so jolly after this.
            Got some CTE in Saint Denis
        He was always egotistical and fed into whoever inflated his already overgrown ego. The concussion just made it more obvious. It also made him irritable, paranoid, and have a shorter fuse. He already had those issues but this just added to it
            Yeah exactly, I think he was already heading down that path but the concussion just exacerbated it, why it feels like the second half just spirals.
        My thoughts exactly. But also I think his sudden instability is a litany of things. Concussion, what happened after the bank in Saint Denis, and Guarama. It was the perfect storm to push an eccentric, but reasonable, man over the edge. I'm still curious where his loyalty to Micah came from, sometimes while playing I felt like he had dirt on Dutch or something. Or it could be, somewhere deep down, Dutch knew that this little family they created wasn't sustainable and thought things would go more according to plan if they doubled down on being outlaws instead of community and Micah was the epitome of that. I also can't help but wonder if Micah was some sort of double agent, I mean his love for Dutch does seem genuine but maybe a *little* forced? And he seems to purposefully be pushing Dutch over the brink again and again with seemingly no concern for his stability.
            Dude micah was literally a Pinkerton informant pretty sure agent milton said so. They picked up Micah before he met dutch and set up the whole thing in exchange for his freedom he had to help them take down the gang same deal as john in rd1. How else do you think the pinkertons always knew where they were and managed to ambush them at every major heist including Blackwater, which was shortly after he joined the gang.
                Micah didn’t become an informant until the gang gets back from Guarma, it was actually kinda late in the story it happened.
                    If you poke around his hide out near Strawberry, you can find a bounty poster for Dutch with a $1000 price on him. Wouldn’t be surprised if he’d had similar intentions all along.
                    Supposedly, someone had to be tipping them off for them to show up to every other major score and every single camp site
                Honestly? Because ever decision they made for whole game was objectively terrible. They constantly had eyes on them, made way too much noise weather Micah was there or not. And just overall did everything wrong.  He who lives by the sword dies by it
                    If you look at it most of the noise before the trolly robbery was either micah himself, advocated by micah or something that would have been relatively quiet if the law hadn't miraculously showed up. Hell the only thing that let the pinkertons know what direction they went out of the grizzlys was micah's massacre of strawberry and this led to the shootout at valentine with Cornwall. Without that event they wouldnt have had to move to lemoyne and get involved with the grays and that business. If strawberry hadn't happened they could have laid low at horseshoe and done their scams around town and pulled off a minor bank robbery without the added alert the Cornwall shootout and continued west like they planned. After blackwater feat micah and strawberries their fate was sealed as permanently rapidly moving and losing men with no time to think.
        I'm pretty sure it started in blackwater because Dutch has been a outlaw for over 20 years. But I suggest you replay the story and take it as slow as possible because in chapter 2 he was questioning my faith
        I always that the Bank Roberry was the turning point.
        That theory has been around for a long time. Dutch did what he did because Micah sucked him off non stop, even when he fucked up. It's not that complicated
    Micah knew how to kiss Dutch’s ass. He was a brown nosing suck up.
        Is that why they're almost always together at the Beaver Hollow camp? I go over and antagonize them (or at least Micah, one time I antagonized Dutch too and he shoved me) just to break it up.
            Yeah, in the last chapter they’re never too far apart.
                Saw Micah with his head down next to Dutch's, whispering and gesturing quite a lot but when I moved closer I couldn't hear anything and Micah jerked upright and told me off for being nosy.  Soon as I walk away, he's back at it again.
                    Sounds about right
    I think it's shown well that Micah is manipulating him, but I think it happened to early on
        Manipulation made effective by the fact that it’s what Dutch *wants* to hear. He wants blind loyalty mixed with a passionate hate for whoever goes against the gang in any way, shape, or form.
    Because Micah told Dutch what he wanted to hear, not what he needed to hear.
    It makes a lot of sense if you even remotely understand Dutch. Micah told Dutch what he wanted to hear, Dutch is a narcissist, ergo: Dutch trusts Micah.
    Well Micah was a very manipulative bastard. He knew how to jerk Dutch off just right. He always agreed with Dutch no matter how stupid his ideas were and Arthur would always be against it.
    Yeah, shit talkers and back stabbers are really good at what they do, especially if their target isn't a shit talking backstabber.
    Narcissistic manipulation. Dutch trusted him because he sold a good lie, he would have cut Dutch off when he wasn’t useful anymore
    Because Micah told him what he wanted to hear and didn’t try and tell him the truth like Arthur or Hosea. Dutch is a classic narcissist who’s just very charismatic.
Michah was the only one that didn't question Dutch's decisions on a regular basis. John, Hosea, and Arthur all started showing their doubts in Dutch's behavior. John especially if you pay attention to a lot of their dialog. That's why Dutch leaves him to die several times
    That's the other thing, Dutch clearly leaves both John and Arthur to die, but the story doesn't seem to develop upon the reason why.

I was fully expecting some kind of agenda there, some kind of reveal that never came.
        The reason is the same reason I just said. Their loyalty comes into question and Dutch is a dick. That was right after Dutch learned Arthur was, "doing things behind his back" and he felt betrayed. 

Betrayal+being a massive throbbing penis= leaving your best friend of 20 years to die
            Yep, I could see that being the case, I just wish there was a deeper reasoning. He's a pretty fleshed out character, especially what with RD1, it would be nice if they had some more depth.
                I think it's just piece of a larger puzzle. The reason isn't that deep bc there's more than one reason. 

Plus I feel like a lot of the story telling is done in side content that could be easily missed. Like camp conversations between characters is super easy to miss but that's where you get a lot of the explanation as to why the gang members do what they do
                    True that - I'm only on my second playthrough now and I'm making a point to pay more attention to that kinda stuff
                >Yep, I could see that being the case, I just wish there was a deeper reasoning.

I think that's the point. Dutch sells himself as some kind of revolutionary who wants to build a better word, but really he's just a thief and murderer with delusions of grandeur.
                It’s always seemed to me to be a really hard thing to model a fight in which one character could clearly save the other but doesn’t. Like it’s a moment that could pass by before you even see it. By making it long and drawn out it’s easier to show but I’ve always pictured the moment of Dutch leaving Arthur to die was a split second decision that came without thinking deep within.
        It doesn't need to. Dutch is a narcissistic control freak. He needs control, he needs yes men. If you don't agree with him you're against him. So he throws them away.
        If rdr3 release they need to explore dutch’s character much deeper
            Perhaps if they did a pre-prequel and explore the gang when Arthur joined 15 to 20 years prior to RD2 - that would be awesome to see. Maybe playing as Hosea.
                My guess is they'd give us the year that John went m.i.a. from the gang. Did they ever say what he was up to for that year?
                If we’re going by how the other games played out where the main character dies we can’t play as Hosea until the epilogue.
                Hosea gets my vote as well, though I wouldn't mind learning more about Lenny's father's story.
The first person to join the gang was Hosea, but I definitely see what you mean, I think he was the second person to join the gang.
    Well hosea and ditch were kinda partners in the beginning then ince more people joined ditch became leader
        True. So he was kinda the first person so join, well. Fall into the gang, he had no choice. Most of the gang members I think were orphans.
Hosea was the first
    Him and dutch met and became partners dutch became sole leader later on but for a while they were partners therefore arthur was the first
I'm pretty sure it was actually Hosea but the point still stands
Yeah, Arthur and John discuss that a few times - questioning whether it’s Dutch who changed, or if they’re just now seeing him for who he’s always been. Could be a little of both, but he was definitely a master of manipulation!
And that is the lesson everyone should take from the story because it happens in the real world all the time. I've seen it myself with my boss and Co employee and the co looks and sounds just like Micah.  It's quite chilling actually.  It's like the writers worked next to me and I never knew it
    Fuck your kissass coworker
        Best part is he was recently promoted to another location and everyone there says he's a great guy.
            Cant's spell great with r-a-t.
            `>:(`
I've never actually thought about it like that
Why has this not been done already?
    Because movies/TV series of video games unfortunately often end up crap
        Wouldn't say that 
Witcher is pretty cool tbh
            It was also a book so in that retrospect they also had the books to help but generally they’re right look at P5 the animation
            I think Witcher was an outlier, the assassin's creed movie, tomb raider movie and the resident evil movies all sucked
            They didn't say that they ALWAYS end up terrible, just that they "often do", and they do...we all know it lol.

Rarely there's a good one here or there, but the majority tend to be awful.

Not that it matters or anyone cares, but I really enjoyed the Witcher on Netflix.  One of the rare videogame-based gems for sho.
        Cyberpunk Edgerunner has entered the chat
    I guess people dont want to spend money on something if they're not sure it will be a hit ? ): 

They just need to HAVE SOME FAITH!!
        Like you say they just gotta have a little faith. 

I would personally love this and if they pulled it off right it could become massive. 

I really hope they do although I suppose it may use up content which they plan to use in a future next gake

We can't always fight nature. We can't fight change. We can't fight gravity. We can't fight nothing, except rockstar not making a RDR cartoon series, which would be awesome.
        Read that last bit in Dutch's voice lol
Giving me Iron Giant vibes
    Hog Hug...?
Just one more score
    We’ll be collecting MANGOES in TAHITI
Yeah you would think that Micah literally shooting Dutch's previous girlfriend and one of the first gang members, would make Dutch demonise Micah and hate him, but nah apparently not.
    the more people alive in the end, more people to share the gold with.
    Grimshaw was beginning to question Dutch's decisions therefore she was 'disloyal' and deserved it.  


I'm sure Dutch objected at some point and Micah spun a story of how actually everyone in the gang but Micah was a rat the whole time.
SERIOUSLY THOUGH, he shoots her dead and he doesn't even flinch, like Christ.
Lol I’ve tried so many times the game won’t let ya lol
    to be honest the only reason i'm replaying the story again is to be an arse to micah and to kill him again🥰
        I don’t know if I would totally replay it but I do have a save after the riverboat before Arthur’s sickness gets worse In saint denis... I like Arthur way more than john lol
[deleted]
    Happy Cake Day!
        Thank you
Someone give this man an award!
    haha thanks. also i’m a woman
        Lol sorry
            no problem, it happens, it just feels weird not to correct 😅
Van fer line
    The amount of depression I just received from you is immeasurable
Dutch is a narcissist, Micah knows how to play to him.
The thing that bothers me about the whole situation is I've been witness to this at my job for real.  My boss and a snake in the grass and the snake looks and sounds EXACTLY like Micah.
And reading it now I’m still laughing today
Dude wat
    Man I made this post high as shit a year ago. FOH.
He didn’t even make it....
    Oh welp haha
He even spews some semi racist shit as well

But when Lenny says, in chapter 1, "when you die, the'll be a party"... he was completely right.
    Already knew from the beginning I would want Micah dead. Just the literal worst person, I swear.
Lol

        Yep, I could see that being the case, I just wish there was a deeper reasoning. He's a pretty fleshed out character, especially what with RD1, it would be nice if they had some more depth.
            I think it's just piece of a larger puzzle. The reason isn't that deep bc there's more than one reason. 

Plus I feel like a lot of the story telling is done in side content that could be easily missed. Like camp conversations between characters is super easy to miss but that's where you get a lot of the explanation as to why the gang members do what they do
                True that - I'm only on my second playthrough now and I'm making a point to pay more attention to that kinda stuff
            >Yep, I could see that being the case, I just wish there was a deeper reasoning.

I think that's the point. Dutch sells himself as some kind of revolutionary who wants to build a better word, but really he's just a thief and murderer with delusions of grandeur.
            It’s always seemed to me to be a really hard thing to model a fight in which one character could clearly save the other but doesn’t. Like it’s a moment that could pass by before you even see it. By making it long and drawn out it’s easier to show but I’ve always pictured the moment of Dutch leaving Arthur to die was a split second decision that came without thinking deep within.
    It doesn't need to. Dutch is a narcissistic control freak. He needs control, he needs yes men. If you don't agree with him you're against him. So he throws them away.
    If rdr3 release they need to explore dutch’s character much deeper
        Perhaps if they did a pre-prequel and explore the gang when Arthur joined 15 to 20 years prior to RD2 - that would be awesome to see. Maybe playing as Hosea.
            My guess is they'd give us the year that John went m.i.a. from the gang. Did they ever say what he was up to for that year?
            If we’re going by how the other games played out where the main character dies we can’t play as Hosea until the epilogue.
            Hosea gets my vote as well, though I wouldn't mind learning more about Lenny's father's story.
Well hosea and ditch were kinda partners in the beginning then ince more people joined ditch became leader
    True. So he was kinda the first person so join, well. Fall into the gang, he had no choice. Most of the gang members I think were orphans.
Him and dutch met and became partners dutch became sole leader later on but for a while they were partners therefore arthur was the first
Fuck your kissass coworker
    Best part is he was recently promoted to another location and everyone there says he's a great guy.
        Cant's spell great with r-a-t.
        `>:(`
Because movies/TV series of video games unfortunately often end up crap
    Wouldn't say that 
Witcher is pretty cool tbh
        It was also a book so in that retrospect they also had the books to help but generally they’re right look at P5 the animation
        I think Witcher was an outlier, the assassin's creed movie, tomb raider movie and the resident evil movies all sucked
        They didn't say that they ALWAYS end up terrible, just that they "often do", and they do...we all know it lol.

Rarely there's a good one here or there, but the majority tend to be awful.

Not that it matters or anyone cares, but I really enjoyed the Witcher on Netflix.  One of the rare videogame-based gems for sho.
    Cyberpunk Edgerunner has entered the chat
I guess people dont want to spend money on something if they're not sure it will be a hit ? ): 

They just need to HAVE SOME FAITH!!
    Like you say they just gotta have a little faith. 

I would personally love this and if they pulled it off right it could become massive. 

I really hope they do although I suppose it may use up content which they plan to use in a future next gake

We can't always fight nature. We can't fight change. We can't fight gravity. We can't fight nothing, except rockstar not making a RDR cartoon series, which would be awesome.
    Read that last bit in Dutch's voice lol
Hog Hug...?
We’ll be collecting MANGOES in TAHITI
the more people alive in the end, more people to share the gold with.
Grimshaw was beginning to question Dutch's decisions therefore she was 'disloyal' and deserved it.  


I'm sure Dutch objected at some point and Micah spun a story of how actually everyone in the gang but Micah was a rat the whole time.
to be honest the only reason i'm replaying the story again is to be an arse to micah and to kill him again🥰
    I don’t know if I would totally replay it but I do have a save after the riverboat before Arthur’s sickness gets worse In saint denis... I like Arthur way more than john lol
Happy Cake Day!
    Thank you
haha thanks. also i’m a woman
    Lol sorry
        no problem, it happens, it just feels weird not to correct 😅
The amount of depression I just received from you is immeasurable
Man I made this post high as shit a year ago. FOH.
Oh welp haha
Already knew from the beginning I would want Micah dead. Just the literal worst person, I swear.

        *LIAR!*
I think Eagle Falls would be more appropriate considering what happened to him because of Dutch's manipulation.
    i thought it was rains fall
        That's his father
            Rains Fly and Eagle Falls
Micah was just the one Dutch wanted Arthur to be. The one who helped to put Dutch on the trails was Hosea, but after his death, he approched the one who had a similar view of world, but less restrained.
This make a lot of sense on the one hand but then on the other hand, the game literally starts in the aftermath of Dutch going a bit crazy and killing a bunch of people! I really enjoyed the story but there were at least a few times where I was like "why are we following this guy?" or regarding Micah: "why are we trusting this guy?" haha
    Perhaps he had a bit of craziness, but he was sane enough to keep it locked up. A concussion is more than enough to break that lock.
        Hosea getting killed didn't help and that wasn't much later either, he was kind of an achor for Dutch i think.
            True, Hoesea was his voice of reason. As more of the gang died, and everyone questioning his leadership, it probably all pushed him even more into the crazy. 

He honestly had a lot of stuff piling up on him when I think about it. Still sucks that he ran off with Micah.
                I think the heart of it is that Dutch wanted what’s best for the Van der Linde gang, Hosea wanted what’s best for the gang members themselves. Comes across time and time again in their interactions with the camp.
    Which is why where I am in the game I'm gonna "hold" for quite awhile because of what's coming next (Hubby is way ahead of me and I watch him play, so I know!!)
    Yeah Arthur makes several comments quite early in the game on the lines of Dutch killing people needlessly or acting strange. It's a nice theory but I think the point is he descended to that point and it wasn't a sudden change.
Interesting theory!

Still, even at the start he shows Micah a respect that seems out of place for someone so unknown. I noticed in my second playthrough, when they raid the O'driscolls from colter (old friends mission) that he liats Micah first when praising the team he had assembled.

It would be nice to have more depth of the dutch/Micah relationship in the game and what was going on there.
    At some point I believe Micah saves Dutch’s life in a bar fight, hence why Dutch allows him to join and seems to be the only one who actually likes him. I can’t remember where but I think it’s written on a note in camp somewhere.
Dutch is a narcissistic control freak from the very beginning. He didn't "go crazy" he just got put in a place where his plans weren't for the best of the gang anymore and Arthur could see that. The whole gang starts to lose faith in Dutch because it's clear he no longer wants what's best for them he just wants to live the outlaw life by any means. Then Arthur starts disagreeing with him and he he can't handle that, again because he's a narcissist, so he turns on Arthur and anyone who doesn't have "faith." Dutch was only ever in it for himself, it's just he used to be able to sell it as being beneficial for everyone. But he was only using the gang to live the life he wanted to live.
I like this theory. Would be quite realistic as Dutch isn't so jolly after this.
    Got some CTE in Saint Denis
He was always egotistical and fed into whoever inflated his already overgrown ego. The concussion just made it more obvious. It also made him irritable, paranoid, and have a shorter fuse. He already had those issues but this just added to it
    Yeah exactly, I think he was already heading down that path but the concussion just exacerbated it, why it feels like the second half just spirals.
My thoughts exactly. But also I think his sudden instability is a litany of things. Concussion, what happened after the bank in Saint Denis, and Guarama. It was the perfect storm to push an eccentric, but reasonable, man over the edge. I'm still curious where his loyalty to Micah came from, sometimes while playing I felt like he had dirt on Dutch or something. Or it could be, somewhere deep down, Dutch knew that this little family they created wasn't sustainable and thought things would go more according to plan if they doubled down on being outlaws instead of community and Micah was the epitome of that. I also can't help but wonder if Micah was some sort of double agent, I mean his love for Dutch does seem genuine but maybe a *little* forced? And he seems to purposefully be pushing Dutch over the brink again and again with seemingly no concern for his stability.
    Dude micah was literally a Pinkerton informant pretty sure agent milton said so. They picked up Micah before he met dutch and set up the whole thing in exchange for his freedom he had to help them take down the gang same deal as john in rd1. How else do you think the pinkertons always knew where they were and managed to ambush them at every major heist including Blackwater, which was shortly after he joined the gang.
        Micah didn’t become an informant until the gang gets back from Guarma, it was actually kinda late in the story it happened.
            If you poke around his hide out near Strawberry, you can find a bounty poster for Dutch with a $1000 price on him. Wouldn’t be surprised if he’d had similar intentions all along.
            Supposedly, someone had to be tipping them off for them to show up to every other major score and every single camp site
        Honestly? Because ever decision they made for whole game was objectively terrible. They constantly had eyes on them, made way too much noise weather Micah was there or not. And just overall did everything wrong.  He who lives by the sword dies by it
            If you look at it most of the noise before the trolly robbery was either micah himself, advocated by micah or something that would have been relatively quiet if the law hadn't miraculously showed up. Hell the only thing that let the pinkertons know what direction they went out of the grizzlys was micah's massacre of strawberry and this led to the shootout at valentine with Cornwall. Without that event they wouldnt have had to move to lemoyne and get involved with the grays and that business. If strawberry hadn't happened they could have laid low at horseshoe and done their scams around town and pulled off a minor bank robbery without the added alert the Cornwall shootout and continued west like they planned. After blackwater feat micah and strawberries their fate was sealed as permanently rapidly moving and losing men with no time to think.
I'm pretty sure it started in blackwater because Dutch has been a outlaw for over 20 years. But I suggest you replay the story and take it as slow as possible because in chapter 2 he was questioning my faith
I always that the Bank Roberry was the turning point.
That theory has been around for a long time. Dutch did what he did because Micah sucked him off non stop, even when he fucked up. It's not that complicated
Is that why they're almost always together at the Beaver Hollow camp? I go over and antagonize them (or at least Micah, one time I antagonized Dutch too and he shoved me) just to break it up.
    Yeah, in the last chapter they’re never too far apart.
        Saw Micah with his head down next to Dutch's, whispering and gesturing quite a lot but when I moved closer I couldn't hear anything and Micah jerked upright and told me off for being nosy.  Soon as I walk away, he's back at it again.
            Sounds about right
Manipulation made effective by the fact that it’s what Dutch *wants* to hear. He wants blind loyalty mixed with a passionate hate for whoever goes against the gang in any way, shape, or form.
The reason is the same reason I just said. Their loyalty comes into question and Dutch is a dick. That was right after Dutch learned Arthur was, "doing things behind his back" and he felt betrayed.
