        Nasty business indeed!
    Classic Marston, always getting himself hurt.
    What a rotten way to die.
        What a shame.
    Could‚Äôve been hit in the head with an explosive arrow right before dying

    He could have been on fire. It could have been raining. He could have been wearing a lame outfit. There could have been enemies shooting at him. They could have fallen into the water. It could be during a mission. It could be during a random event before they had the chance to get to the grey blip.
        ‚ÄúWell, at least is not raining‚Äù

*starts raining mid fall*

‚ÄúShit‚Äù
        You must be a fun guy
            Lol because of one comment checking a classic Reddit hyperbole? Get serious chunky
                It was a boring comment for boring people
                    I really do not care.

        Nah. I'd say about 2018 to 2020.

                What?! Okay then

                        What did I do
                            Nothing. I believe they were just drawing humor from your two combined user names‚Äô being incongruous to dispensing sage life observations.
                                Ahh ok. Well I'm on board
            Jw, why 2018? Did you lose your house *and* job that year?

I had something similar happen to me far cry 4. I ran out of ammo so I was running away from a huge group of guys and I accidentally ran off a cliff edge and slid way down only to get hit by a civilian car. When I stood up and started to try to heal myself a hawk attacked me. The hawk let go of my arm and then a Jaguar came out of the woods and killed me.
At first I thought John was going to fall in the river and drown because he‚Äôs a fucking pussy
And the award for series of unfortunate events goes to.......
    Lemoyne Snicket‚Äôs Series of Unfortunate Events
        Just started playing this game a month ago, so a little late here, but this comment is one of the best I‚Äôve seen
Did you demolish a mirror factory earlier?
This is amazing!  

I had something similar happen to me on the mission to blow up the train bridge. 

Mount over things and pick up dynamite are the same button on Xbox... I went to pick up a stick of dynamite and Arthur just hopped off the bridge and fell 100 feet to his death
    Mount horse and choke someone are the same command on PS4. The amount of Times I've gone to mount my horse and ended up choking someone I hadn't spotted nearby is an achievement in itself

    DUDE! I never played that 10 year old game!
I know saying what I‚Äôm about to say is stupid but... 2020 in a nutshell
That feels like my day so far NGL hah
And after all those broken bones and internally bleeding organs, it was a gator that got him

This is 2020 represented in red dead
This has to be the greatest RD2 clip of all time.
Final Destination X red dead redemption 2
That was so beautiful.
Was NOT expecting the gator lol
    Nobody ever does.. I was fishing in the swamp from a canoe the other day and chose "keep and return to shore " After catching my fish. It spawned me directly in front of an alligators mouth and I died nearly instantly. It was horrifying
Oh no the train didn't kill him the crocodile did
    So basically being caught between 1000s of tonnes of metal isn‚Äôt as bad as being bit by an alligator
        Seems right
‚ÄúHow did my son die?‚Äù
F
It's 100% r/nononoyesno material.
2020, am I right?
Gator ordered curbside pickup.
I‚Äôve gotten killed by trains this way but it was NEVER that bloody or over an alligator den. Bravo.
lol the fact that he survived a train accident where he got torn to pieces and a fall off a bridge only to get eaten by an Alligator. That's some Final Destination shit
The alligator is the fucking cherry on top. How fast it attacks is hilarious. 11/10
2020 i am right?

I bet this has happened to at least one poor sob in real life

Superb. What a game.
Well, there goes the Red Dead Redemption remake. Just skip to the Undead Nightmare remake.
Literally cheered when he survived the train and the fall and then screamed with the gator.
Final destination
God hates you
Hilarious, but I'm almost angry at how resilient Arthur was to damage for you lol. It felt like I could fall incorrectly at times and Arthur couldn't take the pain of a sprained ankle.
Reminds me of when Chef died in South Park.
What a peaceful way to go
Geez! Great clip!
Caynt huuuurd, caynt swiyum, caynt trainraaahd
life do be like that sometimes
Geez lmao
Croc was there like it happens every day lmao

A certified REEEE moment
A million ways to die in the west
Reminds me of the link dies sub
What a way to die
It was a thrill ride the *whole* time. 10/10
If it ain't the trains or the multiple-foot fall, it be the wildlife.
Me af.
(Survived the whole ordeal)

Alligator: Ah, Yummy!  Fresh meat for my pot!
Your not dead unless your *DEAD*
Thats GTA Online levels of bad luck.
cor bloody hell imagine this irl too
How did he survive the train? It's a medical miracle
    I have no clue at all I saw blood explode from him thought for sure he was a gonner
Love it 10/10
All we had to do was follow the damn train CJ
SAME
Imagine dying like this in real life
This pretty sums up the free play aspects of the game
Poor Arthur talk about having a bad day
    It‚Äôs John but yeah very bad day lol
        Oh kinda looked like arthur there lol
Imagine you kill that gator somehow and a bear spawns right behind you.
This needs a LiveLeak logo
It was not that fellers day.
The croc was waiting on postmates to deliver his lunch
Good ole chomp
Classic Jim Milton.
He was resurrected just to be eaten by that alligator
    Truly biblical
Gets severely hurt by a train and is fine but a gator is too much
Talk about bad luck for John Marston üòÇ
Ladies and gentlemen. We got him!
almost pee'd mahself laughin', O M G
I fuckin hate crocs in this game
That slam into the ivy covered crossbeam right before the fall looked pretty cool.
Ooh, well he‚Äôs not dead yet! Ooh ouch! Well, he‚Äôs not dead yet. Yikes! Well, he‚Äôs not dead yet! He‚Äôs dead
Oh man this was good. Glad to bring you back 3 years later
    Oh shiiiii, 3 bloody years, thanks my mate.
        No problem partner!
Stop being a baby and walk it off John!
What the fuck did I just watch
I like it
Turning on the sound makes it more hilarious! "AH! OOF! UGH! AWGH!"
Sweet merciful Hell!!!
When God has a personal vendetta against you.
Best one I've ever seen
    Glad to see people still enjoying it 3 years on
        Wow didn't realize it was 3 years old. It just showed up on my feed.
Going under saved lol
Mind the gap‚Ä¶ and the snap‚Ä¶
The whole time watching this video: ouch, Jesus how is he not dead?!‚Ä¶ üêä*chomp* ‚Ä¶ oh.
south park chef death
"I knew a fella. Got hit by a train. Died twelve seconds later to a gator."
my life explained
As he falls off the bridge I'm like "ok - funny but could be worse" then hits the ground and does fall damage and I'm like "ohhhh there it is!"

GATOR
New canon ending of how Arthur died.  Better than TB
    This wasn‚Äôt Arthur, it was John
Pretty much this

Welcome to Red Dead 2020 Edition
I bet you waited for what felt like 12 hours for that train to show up
    I‚Äôm doing the exotic missions so I need to get 30 spoonbill plumes so I was just chilling there while looking at my phone and then I heard the train and I thought fuck it
        Lol
Yeah ive seen this on youtube. Hilarious!!!

At least you didn‚Äôt encounter the L U M B A G O
Cause you had a bad day

You're taking one down

You sing a sad song just to turn it around

Poor John first Wolves now Crocodile!!

Pain.
Repost
    It‚Äôs literally my gameplay
        Idk but I‚Äôve seen this exact same video on here. Have you posted it before?
            No mate it happened about 5 minutes before I posted
            Dude I‚Äôm not the only one here I agree with you. I swear on my life I‚Äôve seen this played out before in the exact same spot in the early months of the game 

Same area, getting fucked by train then into gators shot for shot 

Tbh more that I think about it though, I think the old clip was actually as Arthur but this OP actually had the same fuck up but as John instead 

We aren‚Äôt crazy
                Okay I knew I wasn‚Äôt going crazy lol
                Mandela effect
                    Or it‚Äôs technically possible?

I mean out of all the millions of players in the world who went to that bridge, tried climbing the side diagonal parts for fun because they were bored, then failed when a train came by just to fall into gators that always spawn there, & we all have PS4/Xbox, you think you‚Äôre the only one who recorded such a clip?
                        No I‚Äôm saying you saw something similar and you thought it was the same I‚Äôm not being arsey with you I was just saying chill ya beans
                            No, we literally said we saw a similar clip as Arthur not John dude

Did you not read it? We acknowledged we saw a similar clip, not the exact exact same.

We aren‚Äôt saying you stole anything at all we get it it‚Äôs your clip. You chill ya beans. We are just saying we have seen this similar situation play out

Also look what I [found](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/amu78q/lmaoworst_death_ever_in_rdr_2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
                                The man before you literally called it a repost and well done for finding it üòÄ
                                    Well that‚Äôs not me dude.... that‚Äôs him. I never said it was a repost to begin with at all so don‚Äôt toss me in that same group

I only found it because you were that adamant to call us all delusional with Mandela effect üôÉ
    How is it?
[deleted]
    dude everyone posts crap with John... we all know at this point
    Oh shit yeah
#13*
    Says 12 for me

                        Nothing. I believe they were just drawing humor from your two combined user names‚Äô being incongruous to dispensing sage life observations.
                            Ahh ok. Well I'm on board
        Jw, why 2018? Did you lose your house *and* job that year?

Lemoyne Snicket‚Äôs Series of Unfortunate Events
    Just started playing this game a month ago, so a little late here, but this comment is one of the best I‚Äôve seen
Mount horse and choke someone are the same command on PS4. The amount of Times I've gone to mount my horse and ended up choking someone I hadn't spotted nearby is an achievement in itself
DUDE! I never played that 10 year old game!
Marston‚Äôs Bizarre 12 Second Adventure
Nobody ever does.. I was fishing in the swamp from a canoe the other day and chose "keep and return to shore " After catching my fish. It spawned me directly in front of an alligators mouth and I died nearly instantly. It was horrifying
So basically being caught between 1000s of tonnes of metal isn‚Äôt as bad as being bit by an alligator
    Seems right
What does this mean lol I‚Äôm a noob on reddit?

It‚Äôs literally my gameplay
    Idk but I‚Äôve seen this exact same video on here. Have you posted it before?
        No mate it happened about 5 minutes before I posted
        Dude I‚Äôm not the only one here I agree with you. I swear on my life I‚Äôve seen this played out before in the exact same spot in the early months of the game 

Same area, getting fucked by train then into gators shot for shot 

Tbh more that I think about it though, I think the old clip was actually as Arthur but this OP actually had the same fuck up but as John instead 

We aren‚Äôt crazy
            Okay I knew I wasn‚Äôt going crazy lol
            Mandela effect
                Or it‚Äôs technically possible?

I mean out of all the millions of players in the world who went to that bridge, tried climbing the side diagonal parts for fun because they were bored, then failed when a train came by just to fall into gators that always spawn there, & we all have PS4/Xbox, you think you‚Äôre the only one who recorded such a clip?
                    No I‚Äôm saying you saw something similar and you thought it was the same I‚Äôm not being arsey with you I was just saying chill ya beans
                        No, we literally said we saw a similar clip as Arthur not John dude

Did you not read it? We acknowledged we saw a similar clip, not the exact exact same.

We aren‚Äôt saying you stole anything at all we get it it‚Äôs your clip. You chill ya beans. We are just saying we have seen this similar situation play out

Also look what I [found](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/amu78q/lmaoworst_death_ever_in_rdr_2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
                            The man before you literally called it a repost and well done for finding it üòÄ
                                Well that‚Äôs not me dude.... that‚Äôs him. I never said it was a repost to begin with at all so don‚Äôt toss me in that same group

I only found it because you were that adamant to call us all delusional with Mandela effect üôÉ
How is it?
dude everyone posts crap with John... we all know at this point
Oh shit yeah
Says 12 for me
    13 for me.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
