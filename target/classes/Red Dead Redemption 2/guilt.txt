A lot of O'Driscolls have wedding rings on them.  I never feel bad.
    Yeah they probably just stole it off the real husband
        That's what you gotta keep telling yourself. *wipes away tears*
            Even if they are married, fuck em and the people who married them
                Only a Sith deals in absolutes.
                    Or an O'Driscoll. 

I've let one go before. Look at what they did and were going to do to Arthur. What they did to Sadie and her husband, and poor, poor Kieran. 

They deserve everything that's coming to 'em.
                        > What they did to Sadie

If only I could have killed Micah then and there. Like she didn't have it bad enough that cunt burns down her house.
                            It may be a little dark, but I blow every single one of their heads off when I encounter them for what they did to Kieran and then usually gather them in a big pile and  shoot a flaming arrow the one I just lassoed
                        Counter point, Kieran was an O‚ÄôDriscoll.
                            Noooooo he just rode with them for a couple of months.
                                Counter point, he rode with them one last time too.
                                    If only he was whole
                            He weren‚Äôt no O‚ÄôDriscoll, mister.
                                He was.
                            Yeah but wasn't he basically forced to be one of them.
                        i got so pissed when one got away when a group ambushed üò≠
                            Wow... how'd you find this comment?
                Odds are its another O‚Äôdriscoll...
                wait fuck a dead body  
i mean, i hear you, but...
                Shouldn‚Äôt have married a damn O‚ÄôDriscoll
        maybe they have a romantic side to them unlike the lemoyne riders
    God damn O‚ÄôDriscoll sons of bitches - Sadie probably
        That's Arthur actually
    One of the rings we steal is probably Jake adlers
Guess you¬¥re the new husband.
    Let‚Äôs see; *my arthur is now married to 58 different women*
        *58?* Rookie numbers.
            That‚Äôs not including the men.
                *laughs in train slaughterhouse*
                Nah artys bi. Ever notice how he looks at uncle?
                    Even a straight man can‚Äôt keep his eyes off such a gorgeous person though can you blame him?
                    Supposedly there was going to be some plot point about Arthur and Charles falling in love but they decided to drop that. Again this came from an anonymous post on reddit so take it with a spoon of salt.
                        Highly, highly doubt it, Arthur and Sadie maybe, but defo not him and Charles, for 1. he had a wife and 2. he never, ever, makes any sort of moves on a guy, not even remotely 3. Charles is described as a ladies man, at least I'm pretty sure about that
                            That one experiences attraction to or has had experiences with women does not preclude attraction to men. There are many bisexual men, and many closeted gay men who did not discover their attraction until after they had relationships with women
                                see 2 and 3 then
                    Remember when he got invited in for ‚Äúfood‚Äù with that one guy in the swamp?
                        *üéµWhat what, in the buttüéµ*
                    Ew gross god why no he‚Äôs not
        ***laughs in Brigham Young***
            Laughs in Joseph smith
                This one is also more accurate if the girls are underage lol
                    I can't confirm he slept with one 14 year old, but I can definitely confirm he married her and spent more than a few nights in the same bed. And the mormons still think he's the greatest man/prophet since Jesus
                        He was,at best,a conman and a mason wannabe.Have you seen the endowments done inside the temple? Shits crazy
                            He wasn't a wannabe, he was officially a Mason. Haha yeah I'm ex mormon so I had to go through one in person
                                Was he? Guess they dont tell you that in sunday school,do they

Exmo too lol,its one of them things to look back and wonder how blind were you to believe all that crap lol
                                    Yeah really interesting thing is that he created the endowments just 7 weeks after he went through he Mason induction ceremony, which explains why its an exact copy
                            Did you mean Manson? Or are you talking about the Masons?
            Even more acurate if the girls are underage lmao

    Plot twist
    Man go look up what happened in Sicily in the ancient Roman period one time. A group of men, the Mamertines I think, killed all the men and just transplanted themselves into the lives of the men they killed. When the Romans sent some mercenaries down to take care of them, they ended up doing the exact same thing, again. Those poor women and kids. It might have been the second group that were the Mamertines and the first group were bandits, I‚Äôm not sure, but the point still stands that this shit actually happened in history.
        Mamertines often works as mercenaries for the Romans so it could‚Äôve been the latter.
        Being a woman right now is rough, but at least they don't have to worry about some dude murdering their husband and just moving in and wearing his embarrassing Saturday morning chore shorts.
    *Kosaku kawajiri enters the chat*
        My name is Arthur Morgan, and I am forty years old. My camp is located in Horseshoe Overlook, just south of Valentine, and I am not married.
        r/unexpectedjojo
    That‚Äôs how I won my wife‚Äôs heart.
Nothing compared to the polish dude. Poor guy I reclaimed the debt, then stole his wedding ring,  jewelry,savings and even his goddamn horse.
    That's why I never do the Leopold Strauss missions after the Downes Ranch (which cannot be skipped unfortunately)
        \*spoiler \* i reccomed doing them atleast in ch 6 because you have the option to resolve the debt because arthur sees how wrong it is then eveantly he sees how the debt widoed a wife. and if you reslove the debt for her you get to confront straus and kick him out of camp so i reccomed doing them atleast in chaoter 6
            ‚ÄúWhy Your a good man. I just wish you‚Äôd done it sooner before he worked himself into the grave.‚Äù
                omg yes
                Arthur: sure
                I said *don‚Äôt thank me*.
                "Now you can choose to be a good man for the time you have left"
            So in my play through did I only get to kick out Strauss because I resolved the debt? Or does that happen for everyone? It was sooo satisfying. I figured it was part of the main story no matter what. Throwing some money at him and saying ‚Äúyou bring shame on all of us.‚Äù What an epic moment.
                oh no its a completely optional story I actually never did it sadly on my first play though.
            lol on my first playthrough I was done with his bs so I didn‚Äôt do them, and then after doing them by opening an old save I realised it was the way to get max honour
        That‚Äôs because it critical to the story to do the downes mission
            circula?
                Typo
    On my first play through right now and I took it easy on him. Took as little as possible before the game would let me leave his property, he can live without his bottle of rum and earrings
    I think this mission was the first one that really made me feel the gravity of being an outlaw. Fighting O'driscolls and having shoot-em-ups doesn't have the same effect as threatening a regular citizen and rooting through their belongings. Especially one that can't communicate with you. I kept looking at the guy standing at the table scared,  knowing he was hiding something. When I saw it was his ring I just couldn't physically make myself take it from him.
        Likewise. Was super happy I got my total before I had to take what he was hiding. 

Might be random because I know that didn't happen the first time.
    Bruh I'm Polish and when I was taking the stuff from a fellow pole I felt really bad
        Well if you get sad by seeing other Polish people get hurt, you shouldn't watch ANYTHING related to history between 1650 and 2000
        Same man :(
    The first time I did that mission, he pleaded with me to leave the wedding ring and I took it anyway... I felt disgusted with myself and wanted to give it back, but couldn't.
    You can refrain from grabbing his wedding ring by taking lots of food and a watch
    that mission left me feeling so empty and guilt ridden and horrible, I actually paused the game, set down the controller, and just stared at the ceiling in misery for like 5 mins lol
    Wrobel?
    Named that horse Poland and we're traveling proudly
I'm always like; "Woo-hoo! To the fence!"
All this time, we‚Äôve been hurting families and killing people and for what, a few lousy goddamn dollars.
    That‚Äôs how you got TB ‚Äúbeating a man to death for a few lousy goddamn dollars‚Äù üò≠
        Well, he shouldn'tve borrowed it if he can't pay it back.
            Strauss preyed on the weak and the poor he was playing a devils game.
                Arthur putting him in his place was soooo satisfying, especially when you realize Strauss is indirectly responsible for Arthur getting TB.
                    I highly disagree, IMO he was the least morally corrupt out of everyone in the camp as even Arthur is fucked up, running scams in Blackwater, at least with Strauss people knew what they were getting into. They needed the money, he gave them it and wanted his money back by x point and they never pay up, their fault, not his.
                    [deleted]
                        He‚Äôs the one who sent Arthur to get the money from the man who had TB.
            You do realize they were all scammed into borrowing that money right?
                I really want to throw in 'he should've known better tho' but on the other hand I guess Downes didn't have that much of a choice and he probably was quite desperate. I sometimes guessed it's kind of how modern scam works. You know exactly that Nigerian prince won't give you any money and yet there are surprisingly a lot of people out there believing that shit.
                Scammed how?
                    They didn‚Äôt really scam them, just took advantage of desperate poor people who wouldn‚Äôt be able to pay it back easily. Like Strauss says, they‚Äôre the only types who are desperate enough to take his deals.
                        Just like pay day loans and money lenders.  They prey on the desperate and charge ridiculous interest rates.  Same shit.
                            Yup. They‚Äôre scummy pieces of shit, but they‚Äôre legal.
                        Yes but thats on them, unlike Arthur and Hosea who just straight up scammed people, Strauss gave them the money they needed for whatever, and just wanted it paid back
                    He told them, to not worry about the money, they‚Äôll get there money they‚Äôll have to pay it back someday, did you realize he only gave them a few days to pay up after getting back to camp.
                        That‚Äôs not true, I‚Äôm fairly certain they all knew exactly when the due date was.
                            It‚Äôs 1890s loaning there were no due dates except like banks
                                I highly doubt there was an indefinite loan put in place. There was for sure an agreed upon date.
                                Ah yes because people would totally agree to that "you have to have the $500 you owe me in 2 days or I take your shit" "aight, sounds good"
            Don't be that guy. No one deserves to get beaten to near death for a few bucks. Arthur is an amazing character, my personal favorite, but he deserved what happened to him and he made the best of his situation thereafter.
                If you don't actually start beating Mr Downes to death, he breaks pretty easily after some intimidation and only 1 (!!!) hit in his face, so beating him to death is somewhat an exaggeration. (I understand that story-wise it's supposed to be a decent beating, my point is that you can solve the quest by only hitting him one time)
                    That‚Äôs one unlucky punch lol

            I recommend staying away from this sub if you haven‚Äôt played through it yet
            Delete your comment and come back to the sub after you've beaten the story. You do not want RDR2 spoiled for you man, you really don't.
                Thank you :)
    That's exactly how Arthur's son and wife died(Isaac and Eliza). 

They were killed for just 10 dollars, and now we are killing people sometimes for even less money.
        Well, yes and no. I only set out to kill Murfrees, O'Driscolls, Night Folk, and Lemoyne Raiders. 

I then strip them of all their valuables, take their heads, hands, and feet off with a shotgun  or judicious use of gun emplacements, and then burn what's left. 

For the married ones, they'll never really know for sure, so they can hold on to some hope at least. 

But, my Arthur doesn't just rob or kill random folks, so I really feel a lot less guilt since I'm not usually the first one to open fire.
        Actually wasn‚Äôt his wife, they never married. He only says it was some girl he met.
    I read that in Arthur's voice...
        That‚Äôs how I read it in my head thank you :)
    I have a PLAN goddammit
I killed a random lady in Blackwater and then I see ‚ÄúLetter to mother from Miles‚Äù when I looted her. Pretty depressing
    Similarly, I killed a guy in valentine and found a letter sent to him by his lover and brother who ran  away together and were now lovers.
        That guy probably had the worst luck
        At first I read "lover and brother" as a description of one person lol
    I had cheats on, went to armadillo, killed somebody who was vomiting near some container with water in it, looted him, found a unfinished letter to his mom, i checked it, boom, instant depression.
        You had cheats on, it wasn't canon. Don't fret.
        Same, found it in Armadillo as well on a dude sleeping behind a shack.
To make it even worst, when I looted the guy, he had a letter which was to his wife. Telling her that the wild west wasnt so wild and full of outlaws and that it was nothing like the stories, and how it was peaceful and quiet and wanted her to come to Blackwater (which i found him sitting infront of a big house) so they could start a new life together.
    Oh. Oh damn.

*What have I become?*
no game has ever made me feel as evil as stealing the wedding ring from wrobel. i genuinely tried robbing everything but the wedding ring, but the game wouldnt let me progress without it i guess (or im an idiot and i did something wrong)
    But damn dude... the rush you get when pumping 12 rounds into that fat Aberdeen
    If you loot the entire house you can find a watch so you don‚Äôt have to steal the ring, I actually didn‚Äôt know the ring existed until recently
    When I got to the polish dude I had to rob for his debt I did it so I only had to hit him twice
Step one: massacre lemoyne raiders step two: loot  step three: profit
    I also enjoy putting all their bodies on the one unexploded explosives wagon that you can actually get onto. Set it off with a fire-bottle for extra pyrotechnics. 

When I'm done, it's nothing but burn torsos. 

Gotta send a message.
I'm pretty sure it's a RNG thing. I've let Jimmy Brooks die 3 times (helping a theorist) and apart from a bit of cash I've had either a wedding ring, a cigar or a bottle of Bourbon. Also in the cut scene when he lives he's not wearing a wedding ring at all.
    He was in town for some strange, so it was in his pocket. At least, for *that* Jimmy Brooks.
Rdr2 missed an opportunity. It would have been cool to be as ble to collect the badges off the lawmen when you loot them and you can turn them in of keel the badges of the fallen police that have crossed you .
One time I got into a knife fight with an NPC and when I looted his body, he had a letter in his pocket saying how he was tired of living a dull life as a ranch hand and wanted to go off into the world to pretty much be a vigilante and protect the innocent, how he‚Äôll make his father proud

Had to turn the game off after that happened
    Well hey man, he tried.  He had to know that being a wild west vigilante has a very high risk of getting the hell murdered out of you.
    he did it! his valiant sacrifice saved other random citizens from your murderous ways
I never even noticed that. I play online all the time and 20% of the time I loot an npc I get one of those.
Find his wife.

Bang the widow.

*She probably has a gold earing or necklace, imma need that*
Maybe he should‚Äôve just said ‚Äúhello‚Äù.
Maybe I‚Äôm a sick bastard but I always laughed when I stole and sold wedding rings to the fence.
    Found it on the side of the road, right?
I have the same look after slaughtering a whole camp and only finding a pack of cigarettes...
    or crackers...
>Sell it to the fence cuz you're a dick
I don‚Äôt give two shits about stealing the wedding rings, but it SERIOUSLY depresses me when I only mortally wound an animal and have to listen to them scream. I pull out my ear buds until the paw turns black. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
    It genuinely motivates me to take the hunting seriously and only pull the trigger on guaranteed clean kill shots. I‚Äôm a softie for animals, so this game is... tough for me sometimes with the wildlife animations. Took a break after the first time I had to put down a horse.
    If you‚Äôre quick you can run up and finish them off with your knife; I‚Äôve actually lost honor for not performing a coup de gras...
    JUST KILL IT DONT LET IT SUFFER YIU SICK FUCK
Dame Dane!
We all have someone special at home. 

Don‚Äôt forget, they tried to make your wife a widow too!
This is me only if a dog comes up after and starts biting/barking at you
I never thought of it this way. I was always happy that I'll get some money from the fence.  
Damn you OP
Never follow a dog
What if they stole the ring from someone else
Sell the ring for profit :D
Guess they should‚Äôve thought about their family before calling me an ‚Äúasswipe‚Äù for saying hello.
#DAME DA NE
I dont like killing random people because they May have a dog and what if the dog missed them?
The what-have-i-done-but-its-okey-he-npc moment
The worst is when you find a random corpse in the middle of nowhere.  And it‚Äôs like - ‚ÄúLoot me!‚Äù 
You think, treasure map? 
Nope, 23 cents and now you have negative honor.
A bit late to posting this, but I thought I'd share a tale of me finding a stranger who was being rude to me, in which I then shot him and upon looting found a letter in which he was getting dumped due to having a bad temper and a knack for violence.

... Something tells me I inadvertently saved a wench's life.
*kill wife*
Now you gotta find his Wife and kill her too so they're together again. üòé
    "I bring lost souls *together*."
Nah dude u can sell those
congratulations
unless its the lemoyne raiders ?
Ha, you feel guilt? Lol

No the real guilt is when you rob a train in the tunnel when it‚Äôs real dark, and their is that one couple.

Gotta leave 2 people to tell the tale?

rdr2 is better than gta
    I was so scared for rdr2 after seeing gta5 writing. So glad they resisted the urge to make every damn little thing into some stupid joke.
hey he could have brutaly murded someone to get that ring
I always just imagine somewhere, his wife is just sitting at home, waiting for her husband to come back to her but he never will :(
I only shoot fellers as need shootin', so I feel like I'm doing their widows a favor by not having to deal with their husbands' belligerent asses anymore.
Tell yourself they cheated
He looted the wedding ring from some other guy se good.
guilt? more like "hehe boy 7 dollars"
Who wins in a fight Kiryu-Chan or Arthur Morgan
Don't worry. I'm sure he stole that ring from somebody else. That jackass.
Sell that first chance you get! That's enough to clean your gun, buy ammo, and have a little left over to save for customization.
Find the wife. Woo her. Propose with the widows wedding ring.
Goes to show what kinda person I am, I never put that together.
What if the person you looted off of stole that ring
I always have to tell myself that these aren't real people or that they don't have feelings and i can literally do whatever I want because it's just a game but still always feels bad when i accidentally run some guy over with my horse.
Hey, it‚Äôs $10.

This looks kinda like a screenshot from the Godfather II game
    Yakuza, my man, Yakuza üòï
        Fair enough never played it.  Godfather 2 wasn‚Äôt a great game though.
What wedding ring? All I see is $7.00.
What exactly is worse about killing a husband compared to anyone else?
    Men were typically the provider of the family back then so, now that entire families gonna starve or mommas gonna have to find lady of the night work at the tavern
Funny how I paused my second playthrough of RDR2 to play the Yakuza collection, essentially sipping down whiskeys but in a different setting.
That's why I tie them up
You saved that mans life
I did the same to a guy handing out racist pamphlets. 





Needless to say I pawned that cocksucking,knuckle dragging, stepsis fucking,equality hating shitfuck‚Äôs wedding ring in saint denis
I honestly never made the connection until now, I feel really bad now
Hey more money right?
I only feel bad about beating up the innocent people for the loan money and hurting animals
I need *MUNEH*
‚ÄúIs she around? Means she has a ring too....‚Äù
Post made by yakuza gang
I don‚Äôt care I killed them because they pissed me off they should have watched their mouth I would have happily killed their wife and their child
Plot twist: They looted it off another random dude.
Dang that chick will always wonder what happened to her husband
If arthyr is away from camp for too long someone will come check on him from camp and you can either go back to camp with them or tell them to tell everyone you're fine
‚ÄúGuess I have a wife now‚Äù

    Just because he's better than you at poker doesn't mean he's a shitbag, but it's just a game so go off.
Guilt.. fuck out of here it's like fuck yeah that'll buy me more ammo
    Don't know why you're getting downvoted, I didn't feel guilty when looting and finding wedding rings either.
        The profanity hurt their little PC ears I guess. The OP is lame anyways .
            I mean you're mowing down NPC's with different weaponry without a second thought half the time and the loot is a good way to make money don't see why a wedding ring would make you feel guilty, easy money.
Oof. Did anyone else feel bad for looting that polish guy in chapter two? The one that had the debt
He probably stole it anyway
This game is so well written though. Have you ever killed a random civilian and not felt bad? Rockstar took the time to make every person in the game an actual person and not an NPC.
I always feel bad afterwards
Oh my God, why haven't I realized that? I thought that was just on him, because Arthur is at his shirt and everything.
I always keep 2 wedding rings in my satchel in case a wedding needs to be officiated. Hey you never know with this game
now that‚Äôs honest money

They made their decision. I have no regrets or reservations.
I don't think I've ever thought about it until I saw this post. I am a monster.
Kids drawings are worse
Yeah they probably just stole it off the real husband
    That's what you gotta keep telling yourself. *wipes away tears*
        Even if they are married, fuck em and the people who married them
            Only a Sith deals in absolutes.
                Or an O'Driscoll. 

I've let one go before. Look at what they did and were going to do to Arthur. What they did to Sadie and her husband, and poor, poor Kieran. 

They deserve everything that's coming to 'em.
                    > What they did to Sadie

If only I could have killed Micah then and there. Like she didn't have it bad enough that cunt burns down her house.
                        It may be a little dark, but I blow every single one of their heads off when I encounter them for what they did to Kieran and then usually gather them in a big pile and  shoot a flaming arrow the one I just lassoed
                    Counter point, Kieran was an O‚ÄôDriscoll.
                        Noooooo he just rode with them for a couple of months.
                            Counter point, he rode with them one last time too.
                                If only he was whole
                        He weren‚Äôt no O‚ÄôDriscoll, mister.
                            He was.
                        Yeah but wasn't he basically forced to be one of them.
                    i got so pissed when one got away when a group ambushed üò≠
                        Wow... how'd you find this comment?
            Odds are its another O‚Äôdriscoll...
            wait fuck a dead body  
i mean, i hear you, but...
            Shouldn‚Äôt have married a damn O‚ÄôDriscoll
    maybe they have a romantic side to them unlike the lemoyne riders
God damn O‚ÄôDriscoll sons of bitches - Sadie probably
    That's Arthur actually
One of the rings we steal is probably Jake adlers
Let‚Äôs see; *my arthur is now married to 58 different women*
    *58?* Rookie numbers.
        That‚Äôs not including the men.
            *laughs in train slaughterhouse*
            Nah artys bi. Ever notice how he looks at uncle?
                Even a straight man can‚Äôt keep his eyes off such a gorgeous person though can you blame him?
                Supposedly there was going to be some plot point about Arthur and Charles falling in love but they decided to drop that. Again this came from an anonymous post on reddit so take it with a spoon of salt.
                    Highly, highly doubt it, Arthur and Sadie maybe, but defo not him and Charles, for 1. he had a wife and 2. he never, ever, makes any sort of moves on a guy, not even remotely 3. Charles is described as a ladies man, at least I'm pretty sure about that
                        That one experiences attraction to or has had experiences with women does not preclude attraction to men. There are many bisexual men, and many closeted gay men who did not discover their attraction until after they had relationships with women
                            see 2 and 3 then
                Remember when he got invited in for ‚Äúfood‚Äù with that one guy in the swamp?
                    *üéµWhat what, in the buttüéµ*
                Ew gross god why no he‚Äôs not

            This one is also more accurate if the girls are underage lol
                I can't confirm he slept with one 14 year old, but I can definitely confirm he married her and spent more than a few nights in the same bed. And the mormons still think he's the greatest man/prophet since Jesus
                    He was,at best,a conman and a mason wannabe.Have you seen the endowments done inside the temple? Shits crazy
                        He wasn't a wannabe, he was officially a Mason. Haha yeah I'm ex mormon so I had to go through one in person
                            Was he? Guess they dont tell you that in sunday school,do they

Exmo too lol,its one of them things to look back and wonder how blind were you to believe all that crap lol
                                Yeah really interesting thing is that he created the endowments just 7 weeks after he went through he Mason induction ceremony, which explains why its an exact copy
                        Did you mean Manson? Or are you talking about the Masons?
        Even more acurate if the girls are underage lmao

Plot twist
Man go look up what happened in Sicily in the ancient Roman period one time. A group of men, the Mamertines I think, killed all the men and just transplanted themselves into the lives of the men they killed. When the Romans sent some mercenaries down to take care of them, they ended up doing the exact same thing, again. Those poor women and kids. It might have been the second group that were the Mamertines and the first group were bandits, I‚Äôm not sure, but the point still stands that this shit actually happened in history.
    Mamertines often works as mercenaries for the Romans so it could‚Äôve been the latter.
    Being a woman right now is rough, but at least they don't have to worry about some dude murdering their husband and just moving in and wearing his embarrassing Saturday morning chore shorts.

    My name is Arthur Morgan, and I am forty years old. My camp is located in Horseshoe Overlook, just south of Valentine, and I am not married.
    r/unexpectedjojo
That‚Äôs how I won my wife‚Äôs heart.
That's why I never do the Leopold Strauss missions after the Downes Ranch (which cannot be skipped unfortunately)
    \*spoiler \* i reccomed doing them atleast in ch 6 because you have the option to resolve the debt because arthur sees how wrong it is then eveantly he sees how the debt widoed a wife. and if you reslove the debt for her you get to confront straus and kick him out of camp so i reccomed doing them atleast in chaoter 6
        ‚ÄúWhy Your a good man. I just wish you‚Äôd done it sooner before he worked himself into the grave.‚Äù
            omg yes
            Arthur: sure
            I said *don‚Äôt thank me*.
            "Now you can choose to be a good man for the time you have left"
        So in my play through did I only get to kick out Strauss because I resolved the debt? Or does that happen for everyone? It was sooo satisfying. I figured it was part of the main story no matter what. Throwing some money at him and saying ‚Äúyou bring shame on all of us.‚Äù What an epic moment.
            oh no its a completely optional story I actually never did it sadly on my first play though.
        lol on my first playthrough I was done with his bs so I didn‚Äôt do them, and then after doing them by opening an old save I realised it was the way to get max honour
    That‚Äôs because it critical to the story to do the downes mission
        circula?
            Typo
On my first play through right now and I took it easy on him. Took as little as possible before the game would let me leave his property, he can live without his bottle of rum and earrings
I think this mission was the first one that really made me feel the gravity of being an outlaw. Fighting O'driscolls and having shoot-em-ups doesn't have the same effect as threatening a regular citizen and rooting through their belongings. Especially one that can't communicate with you. I kept looking at the guy standing at the table scared,  knowing he was hiding something. When I saw it was his ring I just couldn't physically make myself take it from him.
    Likewise. Was super happy I got my total before I had to take what he was hiding. 

Might be random because I know that didn't happen the first time.
Bruh I'm Polish and when I was taking the stuff from a fellow pole I felt really bad
    Well if you get sad by seeing other Polish people get hurt, you shouldn't watch ANYTHING related to history between 1650 and 2000
    Same man :(
The first time I did that mission, he pleaded with me to leave the wedding ring and I took it anyway... I felt disgusted with myself and wanted to give it back, but couldn't.
You can refrain from grabbing his wedding ring by taking lots of food and a watch
that mission left me feeling so empty and guilt ridden and horrible, I actually paused the game, set down the controller, and just stared at the ceiling in misery for like 5 mins lol
Wrobel?
Named that horse Poland and we're traveling proudly
That‚Äôs how you got TB ‚Äúbeating a man to death for a few lousy goddamn dollars‚Äù üò≠
    Well, he shouldn'tve borrowed it if he can't pay it back.
        Strauss preyed on the weak and the poor he was playing a devils game.
            Arthur putting him in his place was soooo satisfying, especially when you realize Strauss is indirectly responsible for Arthur getting TB.
                I highly disagree, IMO he was the least morally corrupt out of everyone in the camp as even Arthur is fucked up, running scams in Blackwater, at least with Strauss people knew what they were getting into. They needed the money, he gave them it and wanted his money back by x point and they never pay up, their fault, not his.
                [deleted]
                    He‚Äôs the one who sent Arthur to get the money from the man who had TB.
        You do realize they were all scammed into borrowing that money right?
            I really want to throw in 'he should've known better tho' but on the other hand I guess Downes didn't have that much of a choice and he probably was quite desperate. I sometimes guessed it's kind of how modern scam works. You know exactly that Nigerian prince won't give you any money and yet there are surprisingly a lot of people out there believing that shit.
            Scammed how?
                They didn‚Äôt really scam them, just took advantage of desperate poor people who wouldn‚Äôt be able to pay it back easily. Like Strauss says, they‚Äôre the only types who are desperate enough to take his deals.
                    Just like pay day loans and money lenders.  They prey on the desperate and charge ridiculous interest rates.  Same shit.
                        Yup. They‚Äôre scummy pieces of shit, but they‚Äôre legal.
                    Yes but thats on them, unlike Arthur and Hosea who just straight up scammed people, Strauss gave them the money they needed for whatever, and just wanted it paid back
                He told them, to not worry about the money, they‚Äôll get there money they‚Äôll have to pay it back someday, did you realize he only gave them a few days to pay up after getting back to camp.
                    That‚Äôs not true, I‚Äôm fairly certain they all knew exactly when the due date was.
                        It‚Äôs 1890s loaning there were no due dates except like banks
                            I highly doubt there was an indefinite loan put in place. There was for sure an agreed upon date.
                            Ah yes because people would totally agree to that "you have to have the $500 you owe me in 2 days or I take your shit" "aight, sounds good"
        Don't be that guy. No one deserves to get beaten to near death for a few bucks. Arthur is an amazing character, my personal favorite, but he deserved what happened to him and he made the best of his situation thereafter.
            If you don't actually start beating Mr Downes to death, he breaks pretty easily after some intimidation and only 1 (!!!) hit in his face, so beating him to death is somewhat an exaggeration. (I understand that story-wise it's supposed to be a decent beating, my point is that you can solve the quest by only hitting him one time)
                That‚Äôs one unlucky punch lol

That's exactly how Arthur's son and wife died(Isaac and Eliza). 

They were killed for just 10 dollars, and now we are killing people sometimes for even less money.
    Well, yes and no. I only set out to kill Murfrees, O'Driscolls, Night Folk, and Lemoyne Raiders. 

I then strip them of all their valuables, take their heads, hands, and feet off with a shotgun  or judicious use of gun emplacements, and then burn what's left. 

For the married ones, they'll never really know for sure, so they can hold on to some hope at least. 

But, my Arthur doesn't just rob or kill random folks, so I really feel a lot less guilt since I'm not usually the first one to open fire.
    Actually wasn‚Äôt his wife, they never married. He only says it was some girl he met.
I read that in Arthur's voice...
    That‚Äôs how I read it in my head thank you :)
I have a PLAN goddammit
Similarly, I killed a guy in valentine and found a letter sent to him by his lover and brother who ran  away together and were now lovers.
    That guy probably had the worst luck
    At first I read "lover and brother" as a description of one person lol
I had cheats on, went to armadillo, killed somebody who was vomiting near some container with water in it, looted him, found a unfinished letter to his mom, i checked it, boom, instant depression.
    You had cheats on, it wasn't canon. Don't fret.
    Same, found it in Armadillo as well on a dude sleeping behind a shack.

But damn dude... the rush you get when pumping 12 rounds into that fat Aberdeen
If you loot the entire house you can find a watch so you don‚Äôt have to steal the ring, I actually didn‚Äôt know the ring existed until recently
When I got to the polish dude I had to rob for his debt I did it so I only had to hit him twice
I also enjoy putting all their bodies on the one unexploded explosives wagon that you can actually get onto. Set it off with a fire-bottle for extra pyrotechnics. 

When I'm done, it's nothing but burn torsos.

Don't know why you're getting downvoted, I didn't feel guilty when looting and finding wedding rings either.
    The profanity hurt their little PC ears I guess. The OP is lame anyways .
        I mean you're mowing down NPC's with different weaponry without a second thought half the time and the loot is a good way to make money don't see why a wedding ring would make you feel guilty, easy money.
That's what you gotta keep telling yourself. *wipes away tears*
    Even if they are married, fuck em and the people who married them
        Only a Sith deals in absolutes.
            Or an O'Driscoll. 

I've let one go before. Look at what they did and were going to do to Arthur. What they did to Sadie and her husband, and poor, poor Kieran. 

They deserve everything that's coming to 'em.
                > What they did to Sadie

If only I could have killed Micah then and there. Like she didn't have it bad enough that cunt burns down her house.

                Counter point, Kieran was an O‚ÄôDriscoll.
                    Noooooo he just rode with them for a couple of months.
                        Counter point, he rode with them one last time too.
                            If only he was whole

Well, yes and no. I only set out to kill Murfrees, O'Driscolls, Night Folk, and Lemoyne Raiders. 

I then strip them of all their valuables, take their heads, hands, and feet off with a shotgun  or judicious use of gun emplacements, and then burn what's left. 

For the married ones, they'll never really know for sure, so they can hold on to some hope at least. 

But, my Arthur doesn't just rob or kill random folks, so I really feel a lot less guilt since I'm not usually the first one to open fire.
Actually wasn‚Äôt his wife, they never married. He only says it was some girl he met.
That‚Äôs how I read it in my head thank you :)
That guy probably had the worst luck
At first I read "lover and brother" as a description of one person lol
You had cheats on, it wasn't canon. Don't fret.
Same, found it in Armadillo as well on a dude sleeping behind a shack.
ANTA GAH... SUKI DEH SUKI-SUGITE
Wild West Hot Coffee Mod? Yee-haw, partner!
Fair enough never played it.  Godfather 2 wasn‚Äôt a great game though.
The profanity hurt their little PC ears I guess. The OP is lame anyways .
    I mean you're mowing down NPC's with different weaponry without a second thought half the time and the loot is a good way to make money don't see why a wedding ring would make you feel guilty, easy money.
Even if they are married, fuck em and the people who married them
    Only a Sith deals in absolutes.
        Or an O'Driscoll. 

I've let one go before. Look at what they did and were going to do to Arthur. What they did to Sadie and her husband, and poor, poor Kieran. 

They deserve everything that's coming to 'em.
            > What they did to Sadie

If only I could have killed Micah then and there. Like she didn't have it bad enough that cunt burns down her house.
                It may be a little dark, but I blow every single one of their heads off when I encounter them for what they did to Kieran and then usually gather them in a big pile and  shoot a flaming arrow the one I just lassoed
            Counter point, Kieran was an O‚ÄôDriscoll.
                Noooooo he just rode with them for a couple of months.
                    Counter point, he rode with them one last time too.
                        If only he was whole
                He weren‚Äôt no O‚ÄôDriscoll, mister.
                    He was.
                Yeah but wasn't he basically forced to be one of them.
            i got so pissed when one got away when a group ambushed üò≠
                Wow... how'd you find this comment?
    Odds are its another O‚Äôdriscoll...
    wait fuck a dead body  
i mean, i hear you, but...
    Shouldn‚Äôt have married a damn O‚ÄôDriscoll
That‚Äôs not including the men.
    *laughs in train slaughterhouse*
    Nah artys bi. Ever notice how he looks at uncle?
        Even a straight man can‚Äôt keep his eyes off such a gorgeous person though can you blame him?
        Supposedly there was going to be some plot point about Arthur and Charles falling in love but they decided to drop that. Again this came from an anonymous post on reddit so take it with a spoon of salt.
            Highly, highly doubt it, Arthur and Sadie maybe, but defo not him and Charles, for 1. he had a wife and 2. he never, ever, makes any sort of moves on a guy, not even remotely 3. Charles is described as a ladies man, at least I'm pretty sure about that
                That one experiences attraction to or has had experiences with women does not preclude attraction to men. There are many bisexual men, and many closeted gay men who did not discover their attraction until after they had relationships with women
                    see 2 and 3 then
        Remember when he got invited in for ‚Äúfood‚Äù with that one guy in the swamp?
            *üéµWhat what, in the buttüéµ*
        Ew gross god why no he‚Äôs not
Laughs in Joseph smith
    This one is also more accurate if the girls are underage lol
        I can't confirm he slept with one 14 year old, but I can definitely confirm he married her and spent more than a few nights in the same bed. And the mormons still think he's the greatest man/prophet since Jesus
            He was,at best,a conman and a mason wannabe.Have you seen the endowments done inside the temple? Shits crazy
                He wasn't a wannabe, he was officially a Mason. Haha yeah I'm ex mormon so I had to go through one in person
                    Was he? Guess they dont tell you that in sunday school,do they

Exmo too lol,its one of them things to look back and wonder how blind were you to believe all that crap lol
                        Yeah really interesting thing is that he created the endowments just 7 weeks after he went through he Mason induction ceremony, which explains why its an exact copy
                Did you mean Manson? Or are you talking about the Masons?
Even more acurate if the girls are underage lmao

‚ÄúWhy Your a good man. I just wish you‚Äôd done it sooner before he worked himself into the grave.‚Äù
    omg yes
    Arthur: sure
    I said *don‚Äôt thank me*.
    "Now you can choose to be a good man for the time you have left"
So in my play through did I only get to kick out Strauss because I resolved the debt? Or does that happen for everyone? It was sooo satisfying. I figured it was part of the main story no matter what. Throwing some money at him and saying ‚Äúyou bring shame on all of us.‚Äù What an epic moment.
    oh no its a completely optional story I actually never did it sadly on my first play though.
lol on my first playthrough I was done with his bs so I didn‚Äôt do them, and then after doing them by opening an old save I realised it was the way to get max honour
circula?
    Typo
Strauss preyed on the weak and the poor he was playing a devils game.
    Arthur putting him in his place was soooo satisfying, especially when you realize Strauss is indirectly responsible for Arthur getting TB.
        I highly disagree, IMO he was the least morally corrupt out of everyone in the camp as even Arthur is fucked up, running scams in Blackwater, at least with Strauss people knew what they were getting into. They needed the money, he gave them it and wanted his money back by x point and they never pay up, their fault, not his.
        [deleted]
            He‚Äôs the one who sent Arthur to get the money from the man who had TB.
You do realize they were all scammed into borrowing that money right?
    I really want to throw in 'he should've known better tho' but on the other hand I guess Downes didn't have that much of a choice and he probably was quite desperate. I sometimes guessed it's kind of how modern scam works. You know exactly that Nigerian prince won't give you any money and yet there are surprisingly a lot of people out there believing that shit.
    Scammed how?
        They didn‚Äôt really scam them, just took advantage of desperate poor people who wouldn‚Äôt be able to pay it back easily. Like Strauss says, they‚Äôre the only types who are desperate enough to take his deals.
            Just like pay day loans and money lenders.  They prey on the desperate and charge ridiculous interest rates.  Same shit.
                Yup. They‚Äôre scummy pieces of shit, but they‚Äôre legal.
            Yes but thats on them, unlike Arthur and Hosea who just straight up scammed people, Strauss gave them the money they needed for whatever, and just wanted it paid back
        He told them, to not worry about the money, they‚Äôll get there money they‚Äôll have to pay it back someday, did you realize he only gave them a few days to pay up after getting back to camp.
            That‚Äôs not true, I‚Äôm fairly certain they all knew exactly when the due date was.
                It‚Äôs 1890s loaning there were no due dates except like banks
                    I highly doubt there was an indefinite loan put in place. There was for sure an agreed upon date.
                    Ah yes because people would totally agree to that "you have to have the $500 you owe me in 2 days or I take your shit" "aight, sounds good"
Don't be that guy. No one deserves to get beaten to near death for a few bucks. Arthur is an amazing character, my personal favorite, but he deserved what happened to him and he made the best of his situation thereafter.
    If you don't actually start beating Mr Downes to death, he breaks pretty easily after some intimidation and only 1 (!!!) hit in his face, so beating him to death is somewhat an exaggeration. (I understand that story-wise it's supposed to be a decent beating, my point is that you can solve the quest by only hitting him one time)
        That‚Äôs one unlucky punch lol
Arthur Morgan out here collecting student loan payments...
