[[The cooldown for Grappling Hook has been increased from 15 seconds to 35 seconds.° Path Mains]]





All I can think about is the new guy that misses his grapple spot and has to wait another minute.
    If you miss it doesn't go on cd
        More like missing the spot that he wanted. "Bad aim problems"
            Or when the grapple randomly lets go before you get moving.
                I fkn, hate that. Happens at least once every 3 games.
                    Grapple breaks at >90 degrees, don't turn so wide
                        Yeah if you turn your FOV above 90, you will be able to break the grapple while still seeing it, is why it feels like a bug.
    why the fuck would you play pathfinder now with his huge hitbox disadvantage if you now can't grapple more than 1.8 times a minute.
    Respawn, please  do us a favor and fire whoever is responsible letting these "balancing"  changes take place. They're clearly out of ideas and justifying their  position by doing trivial work.

Yes, Path main.
It's a terrible day for rain
    What do you mean? It's not raining...
        Yes, it is

*Puts on patrol cap*
            Oh...so it is
                We better get inside, we are going to catch a cold
                    Hey another me!
                        Soon to be me too...
                            That hurt my soul
                                F for all the dedicated Path mains amigo
                                    F......lets just hope they dont turn into TTV wraiths
                        Shhhhh *whispers* you're ruining the reference!
                You're a jerk.  You made me think Tom Petty had died and somehow I missed it.
                    Umm, he's been dead for a few years now
                        ...

and now I'm sad : (
                            Yeah sorry I had to be the one to tell you
    WATCH OUT. I'M OPENING THE SKIES.
        Underrated comment
    Dammit I miss Hughes
        I said to myself I wasn't gonna cry today...
        Even sadder that Hughes’ VA passed away last month
    Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood reference?
        Brotherhood? Nah, let's take a trip to 2003.
            Rewatching it currently. Why does that part have to hurt everytime!
                I don't know, but Elicia had a very good point, how do they expect Hughes to do his very important job if they bury him? That's a real oversight by the Amestris State Military.
                    he had so much work to do. Thatd the part that hurts. His daughter not understanding. Then the second punch from Mustang as a stoic type character breaks down.
            This is the way.
                [deleted]
                    Quick stop in 2018
            Brotherhood is better imo
                It’s def a better story structure but 03 has such a beautiful charm to it that I’ll always recommend to anyone interested in the show to watch 03 first then to brotherhood to appreciate more of what brotherhood improves on
                Overall yes, but the earlier chapters are more fleshed out in the original.
                    Yeah, that's the big dif between the two for me - Hughes' death has so much more impact in the original because you have the time to actually get to know and like him and see him through the other characters' eyes. In Brotherhood his death is a shock and a galvanizing force for the others, but you don't get the same sense of tragedy and loss of a good man in a world that needs more of them.
                        Exactly. I understand why Hughes had to go, though. His big brain was simply too OP. He already had everything figured out before it began.
    Wonderful comment!
*sad Pathfinder noise*
    Some guy I just played with said that pathfinder needed to be nerfed. Then he picked pathfinder and after finding out it was 35 seconds he disconnected.
        There's nerfing and then there's being sent straight to trash-tier
            He didn't get sent to trash-tier

He got dumpstered so hard they made a new tier for it called pathfinder tier

Even octane is more popular now since he's one of the more mobile legends

Or he would if loba wasn't better than him still
                is octane bad?
im tryna pick up the game again for the first time since he was released and im addicted to pressing q to go fast
                    Octane’s not actually bad, especially if you’re going to be playing on your own for a little while.  He’s just not great in terms of team interaction, most of the other characters bring something to the table for their teammates in one form or another, but Octane’s jumppad is somewhat limited and specific.  Although it’s more appealing now since the cool down was shortened and pathfinder will probably be less used.
                        Octane is a ton of fun, but fuck me he's loud when using his stim. Every squad in the whole map can hear a stimmed octane running around.
                        Octane can still be great for the team just depends on how you use his abilities

I like to use my boost to get in front of the team and use the bounce pad to jump up a cliff instead of having to climb it, or if someone is knocked due to storm I throw it in front of them so they get boosted towards safe zone, and if I’m feeling frisky (at the train) put the bounce pad on top of front car 👌🏼😩
                    The meta just got thrown up in the air so nobody knows. But he's the legend I play, he's fun and has no real disadvantages, I say play him
                        It’s funny because it a legend tier ranking, they basically said nothing wrong with fast-boi he just is a “worse version of pathfinder” mobility wise... now that all has changed so I can’t really think of a big negative to him
                        Lets go!!!
                    TLDR; No. But he could be (and soon™ will be) better.

His passive health regen still counteracts stim pretty well and will occasionally save you a syringe here and there. 

His stim speed boost is still nothing game changing. 

His jump pad has the potential to be really useful, especially with the new cooldown reduction (60 seconds). But you’ve got to realise what can and can’t be done with it (and have teammates that understand this too).

His head hitbox is hilariously bad (big) and hopefully got fixed this season - but the bugs have been so spicy I haven’t been able to test yet. 

Devs are planning more for him but it’s sadly looking like a few weeks/months still to go. 

I play him, wraith, and wattson an equal amount. He’s definitely the weakest of the three but I still had fun with him all throughout the last two seasons, even in ranked. 

You could come back in, pick him up, and still have fun.
                    The thing is his kit doesn't do much

Sure he is decent but compare him to wraith,to pre-nerf pathfinder

Bangalore passive gives i think a bigger speed boost than octane (don't quote me on that) by just being shot at,not even hit
                    Before the Pathfinder nerf he was a better octane than octane, a better revenant than revenant and a better loba than loba, but now loba, revenant and wraith are still better than octane at speed and they don't lose health.
                        They don’t regen either js

Sure it’s slow, but can be better than using your only medkit/syringes
        Lmaooooooo
    WHO'S READY TO CRY ON A ZIPLINE? I AM!
        *sniffles* i am......
            *In case you didn't know, you get here by winning.*
        not ready yet bro, still in cooldown period.
    My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined, friends.
    let us all cry together.
        :’( time to change my flair to octane....
            Yeah, looks like I'm switching back to Mirage :'(
    Devs: nerf pathfinder

The game: let’s make it so you can’t even play with loba
        What do you mean can’t play with her?
    I feel personally attacked
    They could have the very least remove low profile from path.
    Without the grapple pathfinder is useless, completely replaced by lobas teleporter, I never seen anybody use the beacon towers in ranked
    I hate when games limit movement. This isnt rainbow 6 or csgo this is a fast paced team shooter, if anything they should reduce it to 5 seconds lol.
    #NOOOOOOO....

...OOOOOOOO....

...oooooo
I just got his boxing gloves last night to main him this season. :(
    [removed]
        At least I get a jump pad every minute. Lmao.
            Luis voice lmao
        I just got em on Friday. Feels bad, man. Mained Path since season 1. Still gonna play him, but this nerf hurts.
            Wait you guys are getting heirlooms?
                Been playing since S1, just got my 1st Heirloom ever lol
                    Been playing since launch day 😭
                        Me too, all battle passes even, still 0 heirloom shards
                        Been playing since launch day too. :( we can die together
                i switched to pc a little over two weeks ago and bought 60 packs today to try and get a loba skin and pulled the heirloom shards lol
                HAH. At least your character *has* an heirloom.
    was gonna so the same thing ...but I'm glad that I waited till s5.

I really hope the reduce it to 20-25 sec. I'm probably not gonna play path till they fix him.
    That’s rough buddy
If your gonna nerf it make it 25 second cooldown or 20 second
    Matches with Lobas 30 second CD slow blink.
I honestly don't get this kind of balancing: "yeah it's been like this for more than a year and instead of tweaking it slightly we've made it literally more than double the time". 

Make it 20-25 if you think it should be longer and see how it goes from there.
    It boggles my mind.  Doubling an ability's cooldown would kill the vast majority of characters in ANY game with cooldown abilities; more than double has to be a straight up *intentional* murder.  Respawn has to know this.

I don't even play anymore and I still feel for the Pathfinder mains out there.  Idk how OP he felt in recent times, but I guarantee he's shooting down to F tier after this.  The grapple is the reason he's played, and now every pathfinder player will hesitate to use it in fear of that 35 second wait.
        After seeing Blizzard's approach at balancing Overwatch by banning a few Heroes each week, I don't think I'll ever believe "x has to know this". Some people are just that thick in the head.
            Blizzard would solve all their problems by removing hero switching and installing a draft but Nooooooooooooooo. They’ll do anything but that
                Overwatch doesn't have enough heroes for a draft. The same heroes would be banned every time
                    yea, i sure wonder why those same heroes would be banned every single time
                        For real though. This would fix a lot of problems. They left Brigitte OP for over 3 months before nerfing her, and she was still strong. Me and my friends dropped the game after Brigitte and just opening the game time to time makes me sick, it went downhill since the Moira launch. Hero ban would've at least made the game bearable.

It's even more annoying to know that this game won GOTY and had amazing potential. Now its just a mixed bag with shitty new heroes catered towards retarded gameplay like Wrecking Ball.
                            Fuck overwatch, unless you enjoy playing with people who leave 2 minutes into ranked and basically losing points then I’d stay away. Game is a fucking joke, get these fucking genii and widow mains every day who suck ass lol. Thank fuck for not having a draft, people playing tank and support have to pick the slack up
                                PREACH. That game is so needlessly toxic for how stupid it can be on a regular basis.
                    Yes but it’ll increase the quality of the games soo much and provide urgent balancing data.
                That’s a fucking horrible idea lmao.  With how many different hard counters there are in Overwatch, and how rock-paper-scissors the game is in terms of both 1-on-1 matchups and entire team comps, a draft system would literally be “oh boy I hope to god they don’t have an X character on their team”.  There would be no adaptability or fluidity to the game, and it would become extremely fucking boring.
        He’s gotten a lot of nerf’s, first there was the low profile nerf, next the grapple speed nerf, then limb damage is the same as body damage, and now this.  

I think it should’ve been around 20-25 seconds but if it stays like this I’ll learn to live with it
            > but if it stays like this I’ll learn to live with it

Same. Just going to have to use it more judiciously and make sure to pull off nice slingshots to cover ground quickly. Gone are the days of grappling up to places you could have easily just climbed.
                But now he sucks. That was the only reason to use Path. Movement. Don't learn to live with it... don't use him and bitch about it and they will fix it. If no one uses him due to being useless, they will fix it.
                    That's what I'm hoping people will do, I'm sure not gonna use him now
                        Especially since our new legend can fucking *teleport*
                    I’ve only played since s4 and I was a solo path main until the Revenant buffs and I’ve tried him the past 2 weeks as well. I’m SO glad I got comfortable with someone else, I absolutely REFUSE 35 second cool down with no other improvements to go with. 

I told my homie I expect path usage to go down by a solid 75%. If I’m right I expect a buff. If people just learn to live with it, my grappling days are over.
                    Yes, but we know how Respawn works, it will take at least 1 month for the next update.
                        But at least show them we don't approve. At all. I was a Path main. Been using Rev for a little while cause his ult. I use Path from time to time when i want a really good game, but now... he's not even worth it. I could deal with 20sec maybe 25. But damn. Just wtf?
                            Yes, a 20 second cooldown would be difficult to adapt, but a killing nerf like this one is too much to take, i *really* tried to make it work but no, he is useless now. I'm so angry right now, fuck Respawn and his shitty balancing.
                        What I'm thinking is they purposely raised it to 35 knowing people would complain, then they lower it again and everyone will be fine with it because at least it's lower than 35
                            this is so right..  dev's playing chess redditor's playing checkers
                This, i was playing with a friend and he was downed at the top of a small house , after the fight was over he was expecting me to climb with my grapple the small house, i said "hey man, i usually would have used my grapple to revive you, but with the 35 second cooldown could you please drop down?", i felt so ridiculous static.
            Dont play path. If we don’t play path they will see we don’t like it then they will change it so more play him
        As a Pathfinder main, im the big sad
        I just want to sweeng
        Really true honestly, his hit box is still shit and he has the low profile perk, so he’s both easy to hit and he takes more damage. And now, his mobility is practically deleted for fun fights, which means he will have to position like everyone else, by walking. The only thing he has going for him is the zip line really, and the beacons.
    But his passive is also very strong in fights tho /s
    It’s the kind of throw shit at the wall and see what sticks antics that are starting to bore me. 

They are knee jerk to what they sub demand and they seem to throw things like this out with little indication that it has been tested thoroughly and thought out. 

Hopefully it will be hot fixed in 2 weeks or less.
        I think you might be forgetting how much internal data they have to calculate optimal buffs and nerfs. They aren't making decisions based on the slew of anecdotal complaints, they literally have the sum of in game actions to inform them. They have to consider how everything balances in a complicated, dynamic system and they have way more data than any of us to make these decisions.

I mean y'all are complaining and the update has been live for like, a few hours. Let's see how it goes first.
            [deleted]
                I mean based off what you just said it seems like they don't base all their decisions off what the community wants and instead bases them off something else, that something else probably being data like pick rate for legends, overall kdr for legends, how they perform in professional play etc.
    Its so Path mains try out Loba, her tactical provides similar repositioning but on a faster CD. And she doesn't have Low-Profile.
[deleted]
    They literally made the most fun character useless to play.
    Same. Awful.
Did they seriously do that?
    ofcourse not, they just changed Pathfinder to a human and gave him a female gender
        I'd smash
            especially if she had the same voice
                Who wants to bang on a zip line?
                    Waiting for r34 pathy
                ONLY if he has the same voice
        They also gave him a wheelchair and blinded him just for good luck
yeah make it 25, 35 is insanely excessive
    for comparison, octane gets his full ult back in the time it takes you to get 2 hooks
        I'm glad octane's ult is super fast, but my boi mathfinder needs his hook
            He finds all the maths questions
                But he still can't find his creator :(
                    Bro, too soon.. we’re already dealing with this grapple nonsense
                    oof
                short for mathew
            2 + 2 is 4, minus 1 that's 3, quick hook!

*Mathfinder*
        Imagine nerfing an ability so hard that it has nearly as much cooldown as an ULT
            Imagine having an ult that's ultimately less usefull than an ability
            Wraith mains: First time?
        For comparison, octane gets to awkwardly jump while pathfinder has an ability that puts him on par with *titan pilots* from titanfall 2

Well deserved nerf. Though 30 seconds would’ve been better so people don’t abandon ship because of a “dead legend” bandwagon
    It’s no longer a movement option now
        Yup it's an ability that needs to be saved for a fight, can't use it while traversing.

You use it once during a fight. To get into a fight, to relocate during a fight or to escape a fight. 

Traversing with him was a huge plus, without that I'll just play someone with a useful passive and a tactical I can use more than once a fight.
            what's the cooldown on other mobility legends?

Wraith's and Loba's Q abilities

I mean if I can teleport faster than Pathfinder can hook... there is a balancing issue
            >Traversing

Was the only reason I played this game, felt so freeing, especially for a disabled person. 

Why not buff other champs (oh wait they did).

Or make an item on the map that has a single use grappling hook for EVERYONE and let pathfinder keep his 15 sec cd.

I uninstalled origin and apex.
    Imagine you accidentally fuckup a grappling hook and waiting half the time it takes for an ultimate. How absurd.
        Maybe if you immediately let go of your hook the cooldown should be fourthed
            A lot of path mains tap and release the grapple to leap high into the air, so that would end up breaking the game even more for them (35/4 < 15)
    I tried him in firing range and just kept saying to myself “What the hell I STILL can’t grapple yet” sad day friends
        [deleted]
            there is balancing and then there is murder... If I were to do a Tier list of all Legends I would probably not even put him in

Others: hey you forgot Pathfinder in your list

Me: No, I didn't forget him.
                [deleted]
                    I assume Gibby is still complete bullshit to fight. I dropped the game because I'm sick of BRs and I don't think these questionable balance decisions make me want to return.
And every Octane rejoiced, as they were now the fastest in the Canyon.
    [removed]
        
Instead of making him faster they just Made everyone else slower,i hate that decition tbh
So stupid... 25sec. would be fine + low profile.
    Yeah he was my most played legend in Season 4. Now back to Mirage lol
        Same. He quickly became my favorite after I mained Life then Gibby. I fell in love with that mobility! Oh well, Loba looks sick
            Lol loba and mirage probably this season
                Saaame. Mirage is SO good now and I’ve been wanting to main him for awhile but he was never the best.. and Loba’s teleport.. so fun.
            [deleted]
                Hella facts
                Girl thicker than a bowl of oatmeal
    This is a passive buff to Octane.
        I told the same to my brother, and that fast heal being vaulted is a buff to lifeline as she’s the only character who has it built in now
            Im actually fine with that nerf. U got a gold armor? Toss the bat and the med kit and keep the small ones. And now people are gonna use the evo more
            Well, Gibby and everyone inside his dome do too, but passively yeah, only Lifeline. She could use a more direct buff though, in my opinion.
    It just confuses me why they spend literally like 6 months making not a single change to him and then decide at once "yeah lets just increase his most fun, iconic ability cooldown by 135%"

Their approach to balance is so weird
        Bad Path mains are super fucked now. You can’t afford to miss a grapple.
            I mean that was already the case. If you miss a grapple on even a 10 second cooldown that's still a big window to get dove. The difference between 15 seconds and 35 seconds isn't the difference between dying or not, it just prevents you from using the character for scouting and makes it less fun to play in pubs/ranked, and means you have fewer opportunities to push people.

Basically grapple is reserved as an oh-shit button now.

Good path mains are ditching the character now. Best Pathfinder players in the world are about to be maining Gibby or Caustic now
                Yeah I will no longer main path. His only attribute to truly help the team is gone. They totally fucked this up imo. A 20-25 MAX second cool down would’ve been fine, but most fights only last a minute. So for us path mains who knew how to jump in, hit damage on all of the enemy team, jump back out to heal so your boys can either take them out the rest of the way or at least hold them so you can get back in, days are over. He’s honestly kind of a pointless legend now... which hurts to say about my zippy boi :’( Looks like the move is to bloodhound or Loba. Guess I’ll find out... RIP my brother path mains...
                So basically in line with wraith and octane instead of a complete tier above.

>	Basically grapple is reserved as an oh-shit button now.
                I have 45,000 kills on Pathfinder and I’m like actually in shock they would more than double his grapple time. I feel way to invested to switch mains so I just need to adapt to using the grapple less frequently.
        They did the same in Titanfall 2, nerfed grapple pilots through the floor, then after about 3 months of community uproar (grapple was one of the most fun things in the game), reverted it to its original state
        in season 3 they decreased the grapple's velocity. making his grapple slightly slower. then in season 4 I think they did increase it from 11second cool down to 15.
        After making his low profile take regular damage to limbs.ugh.
            This is what I’m saying... the least they could have done is taken low profile off. Or like give us 10-20 dmg for grappling an enemy, take away gas damage... SOMETHING
                Make it so grappled enemies cant shoot you or you can shoot them :p
        Wait, they balance things in this game?
    Bro They are trying to nerf pathfinder to the ground.
        Yes I have my tinfoil hat on... but think about this: They nerfed PF like this because they want you to force into Loba = Teleport aka. Mobility Skill
            maybe it was to drive hardcore pathfinder mains back to titanfall 2 where we all ... ahem ... they all belong!
        Not even the ground.  They nerfed him to the goddamn Mariana Trench.
            With low profile. He is now the worst legend in the game lmao fml
    If they had changed to 25secs, people would have asked for 18secs.

They will reduce it to 25 eventually.
        20 seconds was okay, i have in mind is the only tactical in the game that breaks the verticallity of the map(before Loba of course), but with low profile and now keep standing for so long i will find very difficult to max path's utility, it will be a challenge, i will know how playing an off-meta legend feels lol.
        Exactly, and his grabble nerf is long overdue, it’s about time


Wish they buffed or reworked lifeline’s ult tho :(
            His ult needs a buff though... half the time it wont lemme shoot the zip or it wont go where it says its sposed to
                His ult should def just stick to anything not tagged OOB imo.
    15 was annoyingly slow for me to ever have fun using him. Was it over powered? Maybe. But 35 is complete fucking shit. It's close to having ultimate levels of cooldown.
        [deleted]
            Yeah dude. Looking at it from this point of view just shows how messed up this shit is
            Exactly. They also cut Octane's jump pad cool down by 30 seconds.
        You thought 15 seconds was slow? Holy shit.
            When you come from TF|2 it is. I could never use path without thinking about how bad he feels compared to a grapple pilot.
                When I first started, I was less concerned with the cooldown and more with the range.
                I mean every legend is weak as hell compared to a pilot. Bloodhound tactical versus the darts? Octane stim versus the stim? It makes sense with the balance of the game even if it is sad. When everyone can't have grapple it's not really fair to have a super fast grapple on just one character.
    Now you know how us Lifeline mains feel when they released that Low Profile Buff lol
        And when Gibby came through
            Gibby literally devoured all of lifelines abilities for himself.
    This is direct correlation with introducing Loba. She has  movement so they want us to try her. But 35 seconds is ridiculous, it’s should be somewhere around 15-25 seconds. I mean his zip line and his passive isn’t that useful, so why even touch his grapple?! I literally never saw even one person complaining about his grapple.
        Really? You never saw anyone complaining about one of the most complained about abilities in this sub? I can barely read a thread without 2 or 3 "nerf the grapple" posts.
    Yea his grapple is basically useless now
        He's useless in general now, oh you can see where the next ring is? Good luck getting there with your one Zipline and ultimate grapple cooldown

Edit: Useless is a stretch, but as a loyal path main, I'm a bit hurt.
            The only reason I was playing Pathfinder was because of how fun he was to zip around the map, but now I don't dare do that, you never know when the next fight starts and you gotta wait 35 seconds to get in/out
                That is the problem, but I don't wanna get bashed anymore about "oh, he's just complaining" when it's like, Pathfinders thing to be swingy boi. It's a fast paced legend for a fast paced game. it's what sets him APART from all the other legends.
            It's a safety valve now, not a means of consistent transport.    Not a fan.
                Same dude, same.
Wow... poor iTemp if anyone knows who that is.
    Skulltown it is, my friends!!.... oh wait.
        For some reason you can hear this while reading it
    That was my first thought, too. He's good playing as other legends but god damn were his grapples fun to watch. I'm betting he's going to start maining another legend now.
        Yeah, but he's actually great in-fight. He doesn't use his grapples to escape unless absolutely necessary. He's going to be fine with this nerf I think
            I think they just put it on par with Loba and Wraith's Tactical mobility skill

basically what they have done to pathfinder is to change the utility of the ability. they want the ability to be used as a tactical maneuver (do it once, make it count) and not as a mobility tool.  

the real mobility god is Octane.
    Back to Bangalore
    [deleted]
        Hes so good on apex
Maybe bring it to 25?
As a Titanfall 2 Grapple main, I am now shuddering as I think back to the short time when grapple was nerfed from 2 charges to 1 charge (though thankfully it was reverted). This must feel the same for Pathfinder mains as that horrendous change did for grapple mains.
    They did it again and it just killed ALL hype for season 5, Im not playing until it gets reverted and ive invested so much time into the game.

-sad Boxing Gloves 13k path main
    from same makers too right? like they couldn't wait to pull this shit again
        Yep same people, I thought they would have learnt after everyone on tf2 told them it was a horrible idea and respawn changed it back really quickly. I even remember the patch notes when it was reverted saying something along the lines of them admitting they made a mistake for punishing fun.
            i'm thinking that they wanted to change the role completely of pathfinder.

From the Legends, the mobility god should be Octane. not pathfinder. 

they wanted to change his hook from being a mobility tool, to be a tactical skill. (use it once, make it count)
                well octane certainly is the mobility god now. Except they killed the rabbit to make way for the turtle...
    They better revert it. They did it with the ring after they quadrupled the damage, you couldnt even survive getting caught in the first ring for a short time and they lost so many players from it, so they improved it. This is as stupid of an update
Path needed a nerf on grapple. 25 seconds though, maybe even 22. Not 35
    Even 25 sec is a big nerf of 10 seconds but would be fair
I feel partucularly sorry for seasoned players who have the muscle memory and timings in their head.
    Imagine not reading the patch notes and hopping in a game as pathfinder. I was so confused and then angry after I realized what happened.
        It's a big sad because you have to either change your playstyle entirely or pick another legend
Yeah thats way too much
They need to stop needing good legends and buff the bad ones.

For those saying the nerf is justified, it is. But I just think 35 seconds is WAY too much and 25 would be better.
    It's hard to balance the mobility that hook provides, sometimes nerfs are just necessary

that said, I'm on team 25s
        >It's hard to balance the mobility that hook provides,

And loba can throw her tactical 75 m away with 29 seconds cooldown. But 25 m grapple is the problem.
            You act like path only goes 25m

A good arc can send you way further than that
                Teleporting 75 meters away in a second is safer than a good arc. You can shoot a path while it is arcing.
                    you can shoot loba while she's aiming her bracelet and waiting for it to land too, if you want to argue semantics here
                    And you can shoot Loba while she's throwing her wrist and landing
            Lmao you can go a lot farther than 25M with the grapple.

Also the grapple has maneuverability which allows you to do some pretty crazy plays.


I agree they went a little heavy handed with the grapple, I'd be fine with the CD if they gave the grapple 2 charges with the 35 second CD or lowered it to 25-27 seconds.
                Charges would be so nice.
            Though it's probably to early to tell, on the surface grapple seems way better. Loba's tp has to reach its destination first before she moves. Pathy starts flying 0.3 seconds after pressing Q.
                And she's very slow as it's flying
    They did lol, mirage got a mad buff
        After like 8 months of needing one.
            he still got one though, youre saying after 8 months as if it completely invalidates his rework
    You can't just endlessly buff everything, it will become a shitshow. I expect the cooldown to descrease, but the nerf itself is justified. Going from 15 to 35 is a hell of a drop tho
        The nerf is justified, but I feel like 20-25 seconds would be a little more reasonable.
    Grabbing 2-3 times a fight and flying in the air and reposition like that when ever is convenient is OP, wraith can escape with her tactical once a team fight and she should time it perfectly so should pathfinder players
        It wouldn’t be OP if the other legends had better abilities to match
            The difference is that Pathfinder's abilities fit the meta of quick and strategic positioning. Good positioning and fast movement is something that counteracted most abilities. Even if the lower tier legends were buffed, Pathfinder would still be a must have.
140% nerf.

Let's just state that again: this was a 140% nerf to the defining skill of the character. That's the kind of nerf that we don't usually see outside of emergency hotfixes for the most broken of the broken in any game.

It's simply an absurd nerf to a hero that's persisted with that cooldown for over a year, and it will obviously ultimately end up around 25 seconds. I'm just frustrated that we'll have to play a season with Gimpfinder because of a massive overnerf. Of course, I think that's the goal: it's Path of Exile style balancing, where balance isn't the objective, but diversity of meta is. Pathfinder is going to the penalty box because he was over-represented, and he'll be allowed out after a season or two.
    I think you hit the nail on the head. The balancing in this game is fucked
    You speak 100% truth. They don't give a shit about balance, they only do this to mix up the Meta without having to actually do anything between seasons.
    Lmao fuck anyone that paid money for skins or his heirloom amirite
    >  I'm just frustrated that we'll have to play a season with Gimpfinder because of a massive overnerf. 

I won't, I uninstalled the game and origin.
I'm so upset about this.
[deleted]
    Respawn: Wraiths, Pathfinders, Wattsons and Lifelines are fun characters to play? Not on our watch!!
    Because its Respawn's method - kneejerk reaction with no consideration of how the players might feel. They never just slightly nerf or slightly buff anything - if something is overpowered they nerf it so hard literally nobody will use it, and if its underpowered they shoot it straight up to god-tier. They're basically throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks, only they don't actually care what sticks they just hope that it does.
Petition to revert pathfinder changes
First they came for the Wraith mains and I did not speak out because I was not a Wraith main...
    My English teacher is would be proud.
From a path main fuck this
    Like I don't want to switch legend as I've bought stuff for him n have all my stats on him and I really do still love the grapple in concept :/
        I didn't buy stuff but i have all my stats on him as well, and i actually played him today, you have to think very tactically with the grapple instead of having fun with it :(
            Its not even that you have to just think tactically you had to do that anyway now you just don't get to use it when you want lol.
            Honestly it's like should I use it now? But what if I need it again...and yeah the fun of slingshotting urself along can't be beat
                Exactly i used to grapple going in fights, escaping fights, going up somewhere, dropping from a high place to cancel that pause when u hut the ground, grapple the ground and launch myself just for fun, now it's for escaping fights only :(
                    They've ruined one of the most fun to play video game characters ever made :(
This makes me very upset
Reading these comments, I never realized how many people get so mad about Pathfinder's mobility lol.  In the hundreds of hours I've played I've never been mad about anything an enemy Pathfinder has done play wise in game.
    Yeah, i always thought that pathfinder's mobility really depends on the player, some are skilled with it and some aren't (like me) but i never found it particularly over powered, 35 seconds seems a little bit too much for me
    Pathfinder is literally the last character I would have thought be pissed off about. It's not like he can peek with a personal shield behind another dome shield then battle res while blowing you to bits.  


But oh nooooo that one thing that Pathfinder can do is too OP in a firefight.
    its reddit so naturally the vocal minority comes out to voice their claims and it gets upvoted as if its popular and widely held opinion
[deleted]
    There’s no running from a bloodthirsty Pathfinder.
        Seriously you fight out one pathfinder on a rooftop and then hear the grapple noise behind you...
    loba gonna do that now. she can even port through fenced windows and stuff
        Her tac wait is longer and the animation isn’t great for pushing engagements
            Thats the thing. Lobas tactical isnt really an effective escape method, its better for flanking or fast travel. 

Paths grapple is good for all of those things plus pretty much any other situation in the game.
    > getting out of every engagement they're losing 

True I only wish Bang would get the same treatment, x2 smokes at 32 second cooldown is just as annoying.
        Except threat sights make her smoke useless.
    Good thing is I won't be stuck running around as a solo when my squad gets wiped...cause I'll get caught too. :(
    My favorite is taking a long drop late in the game and see what looks like a spiderweb from some multi-team pathfinder nonsense below.
35? Prepared to never see him used again.

Watch next patch bring it down to a reasonable 25.
    Ya, I think 25 is the sweet spot. 35 is a death sentence
        35 is just criminal.  He's one of their flagship characters and they've massacred him.
            I feel like limiting mobility for a lo pro legend is never a good idea. Thats why ppl not using lifeline anymore, need to be able to move if ur a lo pro
        No, 0 is the sweet spot. I need to have a grapple on both arms with no recharge time, so I can fly around like spiderman.
Wait. So you just took the most satisfying ability in the game, and more than doubled it's CDR? Brilliant.
    I always thought CDR stood for Cool Down Reduction.
35 seconds??? That has to be a joke right? Pathfinder will be trash with a 35 second cool down for his grapple
As a pathfinder only main since season one I would like to announce my retirement. Time to uninstall.
    Loba is the new path. That tactical is insane.
        Dude it's not even about the tactical aspect it just just plain fun, It probably was way too powerful but Im not a pro player, and for me apex was all about fun, and my fav was pathfinder :/. And a little bit of love for apex dies today.
            That’s a very fair pov. Path has awesome voice lines and character model. Feels bad to have a legend that lost their identity. (I was hoping for 20 sec but 35 is craaaaaxy)
What the fuck lmao.

Did they just decide to kill the most fun character of the game?
    Fucking idiots.. grappling is literally the 9nly thing pathfinder can do
This isn't a nerf

This is an execution

 https://imgur.com/gallery/QtZ9Hfo
Why is he even still a character? If you're really concerned with his mobility, give all the other characters a grapple hook like they have in Titanfall. They've nerfed hook sooo many times and added low profile.....if you really don't want him to be picked as a character, just fucking delete him.
    That's something I'd hoped they would do eventually. Give every character a grapple and make Pathfinder's grapple stronger since he specializes in it. I think everyone should get to enjoy the grapple mechanic in this game, the fast pace is precisely why I fell in love with Apex, and now it feels like they'd rather we camp rooftops with snipers.
    This. End the suffering.
what a stupid fucking decision this was. especially when adding another new mobile character. fucking dumb.
Awful nerf imo they should make it 20 seconds since he’s literally all about mobility wtf.
This basically killed the game for me tbh, Path was basically the only character I played because I love his movement and now I feel like I have no reason to go back to it
They are ruining the game
But go on keep buying stupid skins
I was so happy reading through the patch notes. Got to pathfinder. You ruined my boy. Take it to 20 max.
Wtf... I mained pathfinder since I started playing season 1. This is straight bs
I've already been in and out of Apex but the constant nerfs are ridiculous. 

Respawn: "Quick escapes make combat weird"
Also Respawn: *releases another teleporting character*
Respawn change it back. I’ve not seen one fucking “nerf pathfinder” post in my entire time being subbed to the games subreddit. You ruined a fun character, and I’m probably not going to be playing this game until you fix it back to 15, or at the very least 22.  The fact that you guys actually managed to fuck up a character this bad is astounding, yet should be expected from a company that has done nothing to change the server bugs, or to listen to the majority of the player base on issues that need to be fixed.
WAIT, IS THIS TRUE??!!
F
look at lifeline acting like she shouldn't be in a deathbox also
Got myself the heirloom about 2 weeks ago aswell...
wanna die right now
That seems a ~~little~~ very excessive.
I'm not a Path main but that seems a little excessive
Ridiculous. You already decreased the velocity so it’s difficult to get out of combat. You just made a lot of peoples main obsolete.
The fuck is the point, who made the change go live? I don’t want to wait for another patch for it to go down to say 25 seconds. I feel like this is going to be dragged on, you’re killing the main appeal of the character.
Whose ready to cry on a zip line?
Yeah I'm a path main and I tried to grapple at the normal time and got disappointed.
Now playing with pathfinder isn't fun anymore with that damn cooldown who's longer than a teamfight
[deleted]
If its 35 then at least give him 2 carges if it
    If we are running the two charge gang it would need to be a longer charge imo. Grapple in, PK shot, grapple out in 2s? That would be wildddd
        Pk? I've got some bad news for you brother...
            Don’t tell me
        You mean mastiff shot.
        It can have two charges, but give it a Spider-Man rule. The second charge is only usable during the flight of your first grapple; once you've touched the ground your cooldown begins.
    Now im imagine him with grapples on both arms swinging from buildings like spiderman
Seriously though, what the fuck were they thinking when they legitimately tested 35 seconds as a CD for the grapple and thought "yea, this is better"? Might be the worst change I've ever seen in the game.
    There's no way in hell they picked 35 seconds for "balance". I doubt they even tested it. They just picked a huge number to try to kill Pathfinder.
Hah. I had been considering picking the game back up lately too. Guess that’s the end of that idea
Here’s my tin foil hat theory. Since Loba is the new legend and has another “hyper-mobile tactical” they want all the veteran path finder players to play her instead, why you ask? Because chances are everyone who’s been playing path has already bought or unlocked all the skins and other cosmetics for his character that they want. Where as with Loba, she’s coming into the scene with a whole new set of cosmetics to buy. Thus, by making pathfinder see tailor obsolete and shifting all those players to Loba, you’ll more than likely end up making more money as people buy her cosmetics.
Can we get an f in the chat for my boy.

Grapple 35 seconds and bracelet 30 seconds. Way too long imo
    Grapple has more maneuverability compared to bracelet.


Also it's a new legend it's supposed to be busted as hell so people buy her with apex coins and they make money lmao.
        I feel like 90% of the player base is buying her with Tokens instead of Coins.
            Still 10% of 10M+ playerbase is a lot of revenue.
                1 million people are not going to pay real money for Loba... come on.
        I’d be surprised if people bought her with coins. Most players are sitting on 50k+ legend tokens.
        Because Crypto and Rev were so busted on release?
Respawn has always been bad at balancing games. That’s one of their flaws. Titanfall 2 had tons of stuff nerfed to shit that didn’t need to be nerfed.
Well, that just killed apex for me. Path was literally the only character I still enjoyed playing. Thanks for the fun times
Do they realize how long 35 seconds is?
I mean this man could push in and out of fights in a blink. Leaving his team to die if anything slightly didn’t go his way. He definitely needed a nerf like this, but 25-30 would’ve been more viable. 

Respawn probably wanted to make sure he only had the choice of leaving the fight, or engaging the fight, not both.
Should’ve been 20 or 25 but 35 it’s just ...
How can we go 4 seasons and then say... we just now realized we need to DOUBLE the time for grappling.  Wtf....
At least now we have time to polish our grapple in between swings!
Someone's been taking notes from the Blizzard school of balancing.
Rip to all pathfinder mains
Like maybe go to 20-25 seconds first? 35 seconds is a death sentence. Feels bad to be at over 10k kills on Path, I'm glad I switched to Revenant though :)
I’m okay with it being 20 seconds but 35 seconds?? That is just sad
Pathfinder mains: This is the WORST nerf!


Wraith mains: First time?
And I just polished my grapple.
i thought something felt off today, wow, thanks respawn
35?! Bro, you couldn’t start with 25 first?
Wraith main here, now all yall pathfinders feel the same as when phase got nerfed into the ground. 

F
    Except wraith still goes invulnerable. Pathfinder is the size of a linebacker and can now ult less than twice a minute. These nerfs are not the same. Wraith is still highly viable and top tier. Path is non-competitive anymore. This is coming from a path main. He’s all I play, but now I’m fully off till they fix this cause it’s unplayable
        Sounds like every wraith main when they nerfed her.
            Wraith still had a borked hotbox in her favor, and a top tier passive and ulti. PFs ult is good, but janky to use and doesn't make you invulnerable, and down people can't use it like Wraiths. And his passive isn't even a passive. 

So pathfinder has:

Tallest/largest hitbox out of the low profile legends, an ultimate that is OK at best, a useless passive, and a now gutted tactical. 

The worst thing about this nerf is grapple was one of, if not THE most fun ability to use in the game. Phasing as Wraith isn't fun, it's just utility, but going fast as pathfinder and repositioning like spiderman was a huge source of FUN in this game. Now you just get to have less fun playing as pathfinder.

This isn't even like "it's fun to abuse grapple to win fights", more like it was just a fun ability to use. Now it will just... Not be fun.
                Remember when Gold Helmet gave you a grapple every 7 seconds?  ; u ;
        >Path is non-competitive anymore.   This is coming from a path main. He’s all I play, but now I’m fully off till they fix this cause it’s unplayable

Sounds like you're really openminded and not at all biased. I know you say Path main like it's some voice of reason, like it's that you'll know this change is bad without even playing. But that's not how it works.

Give it more than 1 hour. You guys remind me of the Starcraft redditors who would form an opinion based on theorycraft and knee-jerk reaction of patch notes. Right down to declaring it 'unplayable' and 'i'm quitting the game till they revert this'.

I've been reading these comments for the better part of a decade from Starcraft II players, and they're all always bullshit. Terran players who couldn't fathom playing with a nerfed MMM ball. The idea that Protoss players could actually survive without Khadarian Amulet or that Zerg players might actually be able to deal with changes.

*Have you even played the game since the patch notes?* Or are you already declaring it unplayable because they happened to nerf the only character you play?

I see everyone making judgements based on a vacuum.

"Paths tactical takes this long vs  X legend's ult. "\^ This is not how you balance a game \^

You have to weigh the positives and negatives each ability/legend provides in-game. It's not just a numbers game that is "Well, paths tactical shouldn't take longer than this legends ability".

It could be bad. I'm open to the idea that they went too far, absolutely.

You might be right. They might end up even reverting it.  But I won't make that judgement without actually playing the game.  I wish more people would actually give it more time than it took them to read the notes and write a comment to judge these things.

Give it more than an hour. Play more than 2 games before calling it unplayable and quitting. I'm not saying you're wrong, I just wish you'd give it a chance because everyones gut reaction to their legend (or anything in any game) is "Well fuck I hate this change"

\-----------------------------

*Edit: Stop responding to me about your experience with at best a handful of games. I don't care. The patch hasn't been out a day and all I can hear is whine whine whine and comparing Pathfinders 20s+ longer cooldown to losing your fucking hand. LOL.*  You guys sure are dramatic! Imagine comparing losing a limb to only being able to use your grapple twice a minute instead of five times! I can't imagine the horror.

\------------------------------

Edit2: Time to turn off Replies. Too many sweaty Pathfinder mains playing 2 games and reporting back totally without bias about how awful this is, and how much of a dumbass I am for suggesting people wait 6 hours before complaining. How dare I complain about kneejerk complainers. I don't know why i'd expect rational levelheaded discussion when you guys just want to complain and namecall. Sorry I went against the grain and had the gall to suggest people actually wait more than 2 hours before making up their mind. Real sorry /s

3 grapples a minute (post patch) vs 5 grapples a minute

But don't worry, he's useless now. Totally non-competitive and not at all viable. Haven't you guys ever lost your hand?!?!?! /s

Yeah, that's enough of /r/apexlegends for me today. Can't wait to come back next week and find out you've all gotten used to it.
            Definitely not a path main. But I love the bot. He's definitely the reason I first fell in love with the movement in this game. 

The point is not that he needed a nerf. The point is that this is a significantly less fun change to the gameplay. Much like the wraith nerf was.

Whenever possible they should be buffing weak legends not nerfing strong legends.
                Same, I'm more annoyed the most fun character is now much less fun.
        Wraith is top tier because of her ult. Her tactical is a bonus, but isn’t the reason she’s used in competitive play.

Pathfinder’s tactical is stronger because you simply can’t chase after him, but you can still chase after a wraith and just shoot her once she’s out of phase. Path gets away faster and farther, and is a lot harder to kill than a sprinting target.
I was just beginning to pick up path also :((
[deleted]
This isn’t even a nerf. It’s a complete change to a characters ability. C’mon Respawn you must not want to keep people playing game. I understand this might help your servers with less players but how is this fair to everyone? For once I’d love a dev to create a game and keep the game the same and fix things like glitch issues or hit recognition etc. This broke my heart to read and made me less excited to play the new season.
I thought this was a joke at first. A sick, twisted joke. I can understand where the Devs are coming from but more than DOUBLING the cooldown?
I have 45,000 kills on Pathy. 

I feel both emotional and physical pain and I am questioning my reality in which I feel completely lost.
Yeah what the actual fuck? Double it plus some? That's ridiculous. He already isn't that great...
I’m not even a pathfinder main and that sounds like overkill. 5-10 seconds more? Sure! 20 seconds longer? God damn! Love what they did to my boy mirage though!
35 is indeed excessive. If everyone stops playing him I hope that they reverse the nerf to at least 25 secs. I agree 15 was kind of OP. Time for me to find a new main...
And herein lies why I stopped playing this shit game. Any patches come after a TON of whining by the community, and when they do, they’re WAY too far in the right direction. Stupidity.
Here's my guess of what happened in the Respawn discussion

>Pathfinder needs a nerf. We nerfed Wraith's Q cooldown by a factor of 2 in the past and she remained at the top of the pole for competitive and casual play, so we can do the same for Pathfinder.

This line of reasoning doesn't work because Wraith's power doesn't come from her Q, it comes from her tiny hitbox and ultimate (in competitive play). A huge factor of Pathfinder's strength comes from his Q so nerfing it like this proved fatal.
I haven't played since the start of the academic year (season 4) I just finished the academic year, and was  looking forward to no lifeing apex the whole year dreams have been shattered. Honestly what the fuck have they done to this game?
I got predator with pathfinder. Haven't played in a couple months now though. Was thinking of coming back last night to try the new season. I'll probably save myself the bandwidth.
The worst part is that Pathfinder was probably picked so often because he was so fun to play. His grapple and  movement was what made him so great - its fun to soar through King's Canyon, and he's really the only legend that could do that. 

 It's amazing that the company that made Titanfall wouldn't be interested in increasing the movement abilities in this game. It would be so fun if they kept adding mobility to the game instead of limiting them ...
I don't feel so good.
I'll try to adapt to this nerf. but I do not like it. almost makes me want to uninstall. thankfully my secondary finally got the buff he needed.
How to kill the game for me: 101
Haven't played since pre season 1. Not coming back now, my boy massacred.
Is this legit?(sorry if i sound rude im a sort of a Path main is this actually true?)
    yes
Jesus, that’s a WILD nerf, he’s basically just a robot skin with a gun now.
Wtf. 20 is ok . 22 is pushing it. But 35 fucking seconds. A 3 team fights end in less than that.
Grapple can never catch a break. First the nerfs in TF2 then twice in Apex. They should just delete pathfinder at this point.
Losing my 15 second grappling hook isn't very fun, that's why I dont do it
NO GOD, NO GOD PLEASE GOD NO... NO... NOOOOOOOO
Bruhh I get pathfibder needed a little tweak to make him a little less effective but DOUBLING his grapple cool down is stupid they should have added 5 seconds and considered taking it to 25 seconds if it wasn't enough :(
They have destroyed my guy path :(
Guess i quit then
15 secs was aight but for it to add extra 20 seconds is such bullshit
I was considering to reinstall the game but... **Nevermind**
Pathfinder main since launch day, 6k+ games. I uninstalled before the update after reading the patch notes.

I put up with so many glitches, so many problems with the audio,I put up with the fact that everytime respawn drop an update, the game gets 50 more fucking problems and what they decided to do instead of fixing all of that, is completely kill a fan favourite and the most fun character in game.

I'm out.
    😭
Absoloutlet ridiculous. It's the only AI character in the game apart from arguably Revenant and has basically no form of being ahead of any other hero without his grappling hook which was a good trait when we learned it. Still he kept getting nerfed and now this.

   Gg. A.I in Apex.
Just not gonna play Path until they fix it, gonna give Mirage a shot now since he got super buffed
I've run out of cooldowns for this bullshit game
No but actually that’s super dumb
Wait they made it 35 fucking seconds???
To echo someone else from a long time ago; Buff other characters, don't nerf them.

&#x200B;

Increasing recharge to 35 *may* sort out a balance problem, but you're forgetting about the FUN factor. The game is now a little less fun to play today.
So fucking stupid
Apex can suck a dick on this one. Who thought this was a good idea??
I've never played this game I'm just browsing all here is that is an enormous nerf. I'm not sure I've ever seen a nerf that drastic. Was the move really that overpowered?
Bullshit
I am a pathfinder main. I want to die. RIP to all of my brethren, may we polish our grapples in heaven together
The reason they gave for it is what bothers me the most. My fights don't last long enough for me to use a grapple twice anyway, when I did use it in fights it was to escape.

All this does for me is slow the game down and I picked this game because it felt so fast.
Literally unplayable
That's overdoing it I would be much more ok with 20 seconds and even that's pushing it
What a way to ruin the game amaright
35 seconds is way too long. At least make it 25.
there is one developer on apex developer team that have only stupid ideas like this. I don't know which one.
I told my brother the patch notes and he got so pissed that path got needed hard
fucking retards at respawn no doubt. this was not how u balance pathy. double the cooldown on his only fucking move on a character with no real own passive. idiots without question. there was nothing right about this... no he only has grapple. fucking cool!.
Rip
The only way I can see this working is with an implementation similar to Titanfall's, over there the grapple "depletes" in the sense that the cooldown is adjusted on how much you use it. If you shoot it and deactivate it as soon as it hits a surface you have to wait like three seconds, if you shoot it and travel half the distance you have to wait half the time, if you shoot it and travel the whole distance you have to wait full time.

In my experience it's kinda fair, you can use a whole charge to slingshot across the map and leave yourself with one or none of your charges or use a little bit of it to get yourself somewhere near or adjust your trajectory without compromising yourself for too much time.
Havent played this game in a brick but was a path main :(
Absolutely shocking!

An extra 5 seconds would of been enough
More than double, a little much i think
35 really killed him for me. 25 seconds I can deal with but 35 is far too much. Insane how one simple nerf to his kit can change everything for him.
Wow 35?! I mean 25 sound decent but damn
Look how they massacred my boy...
I would’ve been kind of okay with 25 seconds, but 35!? :(

Bloodhound main here I come
Just entirely gut the most fun legend in the game/remove what made him so viable and a thrill to play. Pathfinder already has the low profile debuff, which was turned into an even greater debuff last season, that isn't fun at all to have taking full damage for a limbshot. Thanks EA/Respawn, you really know the definition of what's good for your game and fun.
"We are too incompetent at our jobs to fix the problem of Pathfinder's footsteps and grapple sounds not playing for enemies, so we made him useless and utterly unfun to play."
Truly wondering why they did this.  Other than hit box issues, Path has been one of the better balanced characters since the beginning.  Love most of the other changes and fixes, but this one irks me!
I’ve been gone for little thinking about coming back to play (Pathfinder Main here) and this is what I get.
Nice! Never going to play this game again
Have been thinking about playing this game again, solely because of how much fun I had swinging around as Pathfinder. This solidified the uninstall. Shame.
A few may disagree, but that's Pathfinders WHOLE THING, I mean sure his zip is cool but his grapple takes him places. His playdate is going to plummet, they just couldn't nerf my boi enough :(
    When the pick rate is like 60% it can only go down honestly.
Pathfinder was already balanced. Change my mind
I...I don’t know how to think of this
I feel like its kinda a necessary nerf. I mean if you see almost every game pathfinder is a sure pick because of how much better he is than the other legends. Octane doesnt even get pick at all even if he suppose to be the fastest legend (obviously not when path can fly further than octane’s jump pad). This nerf give other legend more chance to be played than the boring comps in every rank/casual game.
It needed to be increased. But damn. 25 I think would have been just right
If they were to nerf pathfinder, they could’ve just raised his grapple cool down to 20, or 25. Or 35 and two charges.
Fuck this game, what is pathfinder good for now? Pointless. I miss season 1
Instead of a versatile mobility/escape tool, his tactical now is only worth using to escape, and if choke well... You are dead
You should increased cooldown to 2 minutes. That's fair.

R.I.P. Pathfinders!

Apex Legends going to be deleted.

Thanks Respawn.
Who the fuck ever wanted this?
When we asked to buff mirage we didn't mean to nerf the shit out of path🤡🤡🤡
The only character that was fun to play in Apex just got an axe... just as I was considering going back. Was playing on and off but now it's dead for me. Have fun.
I am a path main and I think it is balanced now. Legends are going to be at a good level with each other. I am sad, but I understand because that thing was nasty and broken.
Exactly lol
Who even asked for this?

If you think a Legend has too high of a pick rate then stop looking for solutions and start finding problems.

In other words, stop nerfing Legends that are in a good place and buff the weak, under-picked, borderline useless ones.

(I'm a Mirage main. Path is just a fun character but this nerf cripples him.)
Looks like they’re promoting the use of certain legends by demoting the abilities of others.
35 seconds is ridiculous. If a fight is lasting more than 15 seconds you deserve to reposition anyway.
These devs are very good at fucking this game up.
ITT: Pathfinder tears
The only reason I even played apex was because of pathfinder. *right click* *uninstall*
Im actually pretty angry about this.
RIP, Pathfinder, the best legend.
Imagine ruining your most beloved champion
01000110
Spiderman is dead.
I always liked Pathfinder because of the stuff I can do while looting. I'm not as big of fan of BR games as the rest of my friends and most people here, but being able to grapple frequently made the looting portion of the game more fun for me. I would have preferred them actually nerf the distance of the grapple rather than the CD.
Oh... \*looks at my Pathfinder flair\*
As a pathfinder main, I hope they just undo the nerf and leave him alone. 35 seconds? Might as we remove his tactical altogether.

I do have to say tho, I'm glad to see Respawn giving some love to Caustic.
Don’t matter if the game doesn’t work at all
bloodhound down to 25s tho
They either need to reduce the time to ~25sec, or make it more powerful (2-5meter distance).
The best one yet!
They buffed my boi, mirage
I mean he needed a nerf. I don't know about double tho
Look how they massacred my boy
Well...it’s a good thing I started maiming revenant...I’m sorry pathfinder...I hope we Can play together again...
No fun allowed
he didn’t need it 😭
They want the noobs to win too
quiting this game
Bout time
Now I won't be killed by predator pathfinder mains with over 10mil grappling distance in my casual lobbys when I barely started the game 3 weeks ago :D
finally pathfinder gets a significant nerf. shame wraith didn't get hit with a nerf too though. two of the most OP legends for months and months.
They murdered my boi
With 200 kills on their main and a $300 heirloom. I can imagine who they listen too when it comes to data. Fyi not me. Im a freeloader 😅
I thought memes weren't allowed.
is it just me or does that look like coffin dancers
Its cool. I'm switching to loba main now anyways
They gonna bring it back, people complain alot
“Pathfinder is better than octane!” Yea sure he is
If you miss it doesn't go on cd
    More like missing the spot that he wanted. "Bad aim problems"
        Or when the grapple randomly lets go before you get moving.
            I fkn, hate that. Happens at least once every 3 games.
                Grapple breaks at >90 degrees, don't turn so wide
                    Yeah if you turn your FOV above 90, you will be able to break the grapple while still seeing it, is why it feels like a bug.
why the fuck would you play pathfinder now with his huge hitbox disadvantage if you now can't grapple more than 1.8 times a minute.
Respawn, please  do us a favor and fire whoever is responsible letting these "balancing"  changes take place. They're clearly out of ideas and justifying their  position by doing trivial work.

Yes, Path main.
What do you mean? It's not raining...
    Yes, it is

*Puts on patrol cap*
        Oh...so it is
            We better get inside, we are going to catch a cold
                Hey another me!
                    Soon to be me too...
                        That hurt my soul
                            F for all the dedicated Path mains amigo
                                F......lets just hope they dont turn into TTV wraiths
                    Shhhhh *whispers* you're ruining the reference!
            You're a jerk.  You made me think Tom Petty had died and somehow I missed it.
                Umm, he's been dead for a few years now
                    ...

and now I'm sad : (
                        Yeah sorry I had to be the one to tell you
WATCH OUT. I'M OPENING THE SKIES.
    Underrated comment
Dammit I miss Hughes
    I said to myself I wasn't gonna cry today...
    Even sadder that Hughes’ VA passed away last month
Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood reference?
    Brotherhood? Nah, let's take a trip to 2003.
        Rewatching it currently. Why does that part have to hurt everytime!
            I don't know, but Elicia had a very good point, how do they expect Hughes to do his very important job if they bury him? That's a real oversight by the Amestris State Military.
                he had so much work to do. Thatd the part that hurts. His daughter not understanding. Then the second punch from Mustang as a stoic type character breaks down.
        This is the way.
            [deleted]
                Quick stop in 2018
        Brotherhood is better imo
            It’s def a better story structure but 03 has such a beautiful charm to it that I’ll always recommend to anyone interested in the show to watch 03 first then to brotherhood to appreciate more of what brotherhood improves on
            Overall yes, but the earlier chapters are more fleshed out in the original.
                Yeah, that's the big dif between the two for me - Hughes' death has so much more impact in the original because you have the time to actually get to know and like him and see him through the other characters' eyes. In Brotherhood his death is a shock and a galvanizing force for the others, but you don't get the same sense of tragedy and loss of a good man in a world that needs more of them.
                    Exactly. I understand why Hughes had to go, though. His big brain was simply too OP. He already had everything figured out before it began.
Wonderful comment!
Some guy I just played with said that pathfinder needed to be nerfed. Then he picked pathfinder and after finding out it was 35 seconds he disconnected.
    There's nerfing and then there's being sent straight to trash-tier
        He didn't get sent to trash-tier

He got dumpstered so hard they made a new tier for it called pathfinder tier

Even octane is more popular now since he's one of the more mobile legends

Or he would if loba wasn't better than him still
            is octane bad?
im tryna pick up the game again for the first time since he was released and im addicted to pressing q to go fast
                Octane’s not actually bad, especially if you’re going to be playing on your own for a little while.  He’s just not great in terms of team interaction, most of the other characters bring something to the table for their teammates in one form or another, but Octane’s jumppad is somewhat limited and specific.  Although it’s more appealing now since the cool down was shortened and pathfinder will probably be less used.
                    Octane is a ton of fun, but fuck me he's loud when using his stim. Every squad in the whole map can hear a stimmed octane running around.
                    Octane can still be great for the team just depends on how you use his abilities

I like to use my boost to get in front of the team and use the bounce pad to jump up a cliff instead of having to climb it, or if someone is knocked due to storm I throw it in front of them so they get boosted towards safe zone, and if I’m feeling frisky (at the train) put the bounce pad on top of front car 👌🏼😩
                The meta just got thrown up in the air so nobody knows. But he's the legend I play, he's fun and has no real disadvantages, I say play him
                    It’s funny because it a legend tier ranking, they basically said nothing wrong with fast-boi he just is a “worse version of pathfinder” mobility wise... now that all has changed so I can’t really think of a big negative to him
                    Lets go!!!
                TLDR; No. But he could be (and soon™ will be) better.

His passive health regen still counteracts stim pretty well and will occasionally save you a syringe here and there. 

His stim speed boost is still nothing game changing. 

His jump pad has the potential to be really useful, especially with the new cooldown reduction (60 seconds). But you’ve got to realise what can and can’t be done with it (and have teammates that understand this too).

His head hitbox is hilariously bad (big) and hopefully got fixed this season - but the bugs have been so spicy I haven’t been able to test yet. 

Devs are planning more for him but it’s sadly looking like a few weeks/months still to go. 

I play him, wraith, and wattson an equal amount. He’s definitely the weakest of the three but I still had fun with him all throughout the last two seasons, even in ranked. 

You could come back in, pick him up, and still have fun.
                The thing is his kit doesn't do much

Sure he is decent but compare him to wraith,to pre-nerf pathfinder

Bangalore passive gives i think a bigger speed boost than octane (don't quote me on that) by just being shot at,not even hit
                Before the Pathfinder nerf he was a better octane than octane, a better revenant than revenant and a better loba than loba, but now loba, revenant and wraith are still better than octane at speed and they don't lose health.
                    They don’t regen either js

Sure it’s slow, but can be better than using your only medkit/syringes
    Lmaooooooo
WHO'S READY TO CRY ON A ZIPLINE? I AM!
    *sniffles* i am......
        *In case you didn't know, you get here by winning.*
    not ready yet bro, still in cooldown period.
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined, friends.
let us all cry together.
    :’( time to change my flair to octane....
        Yeah, looks like I'm switching back to Mirage :'(
Devs: nerf pathfinder

The game: let’s make it so you can’t even play with loba
    What do you mean can’t play with her?
I feel personally attacked
They could have the very least remove low profile from path.
Without the grapple pathfinder is useless, completely replaced by lobas teleporter, I never seen anybody use the beacon towers in ranked
I hate when games limit movement. This isnt rainbow 6 or csgo this is a fast paced team shooter, if anything they should reduce it to 5 seconds lol.
#NOOOOOOO....

...OOOOOOOO....

...oooooo
[removed]
    At least I get a jump pad every minute. Lmao.
        Luis voice lmao
    I just got em on Friday. Feels bad, man. Mained Path since season 1. Still gonna play him, but this nerf hurts.
        Wait you guys are getting heirlooms?
            Been playing since S1, just got my 1st Heirloom ever lol
                Been playing since launch day 😭
                    Me too, all battle passes even, still 0 heirloom shards
                    Been playing since launch day too. :( we can die together
            i switched to pc a little over two weeks ago and bought 60 packs today to try and get a loba skin and pulled the heirloom shards lol
            HAH. At least your character *has* an heirloom.
was gonna so the same thing ...but I'm glad that I waited till s5.

I really hope the reduce it to 20-25 sec. I'm probably not gonna play path till they fix him.
That’s rough buddy
Matches with Lobas 30 second CD slow blink.
It boggles my mind.  Doubling an ability's cooldown would kill the vast majority of characters in ANY game with cooldown abilities; more than double has to be a straight up *intentional* murder.  Respawn has to know this.

I don't even play anymore and I still feel for the Pathfinder mains out there.  Idk how OP he felt in recent times, but I guarantee he's shooting down to F tier after this.  The grapple is the reason he's played, and now every pathfinder player will hesitate to use it in fear of that 35 second wait.
    After seeing Blizzard's approach at balancing Overwatch by banning a few Heroes each week, I don't think I'll ever believe "x has to know this". Some people are just that thick in the head.
        Blizzard would solve all their problems by removing hero switching and installing a draft but Nooooooooooooooo. They’ll do anything but that
            Overwatch doesn't have enough heroes for a draft. The same heroes would be banned every time
                yea, i sure wonder why those same heroes would be banned every single time
                    For real though. This would fix a lot of problems. They left Brigitte OP for over 3 months before nerfing her, and she was still strong. Me and my friends dropped the game after Brigitte and just opening the game time to time makes me sick, it went downhill since the Moira launch. Hero ban would've at least made the game bearable.

It's even more annoying to know that this game won GOTY and had amazing potential. Now its just a mixed bag with shitty new heroes catered towards retarded gameplay like Wrecking Ball.
                        Fuck overwatch, unless you enjoy playing with people who leave 2 minutes into ranked and basically losing points then I’d stay away. Game is a fucking joke, get these fucking genii and widow mains every day who suck ass lol. Thank fuck for not having a draft, people playing tank and support have to pick the slack up
                            PREACH. That game is so needlessly toxic for how stupid it can be on a regular basis.
                Yes but it’ll increase the quality of the games soo much and provide urgent balancing data.
            That’s a fucking horrible idea lmao.  With how many different hard counters there are in Overwatch, and how rock-paper-scissors the game is in terms of both 1-on-1 matchups and entire team comps, a draft system would literally be “oh boy I hope to god they don’t have an X character on their team”.  There would be no adaptability or fluidity to the game, and it would become extremely fucking boring.
    He’s gotten a lot of nerf’s, first there was the low profile nerf, next the grapple speed nerf, then limb damage is the same as body damage, and now this.  

I think it should’ve been around 20-25 seconds but if it stays like this I’ll learn to live with it
        > but if it stays like this I’ll learn to live with it

Same. Just going to have to use it more judiciously and make sure to pull off nice slingshots to cover ground quickly. Gone are the days of grappling up to places you could have easily just climbed.
            But now he sucks. That was the only reason to use Path. Movement. Don't learn to live with it... don't use him and bitch about it and they will fix it. If no one uses him due to being useless, they will fix it.
                That's what I'm hoping people will do, I'm sure not gonna use him now
                    Especially since our new legend can fucking *teleport*
                I’ve only played since s4 and I was a solo path main until the Revenant buffs and I’ve tried him the past 2 weeks as well. I’m SO glad I got comfortable with someone else, I absolutely REFUSE 35 second cool down with no other improvements to go with. 

I told my homie I expect path usage to go down by a solid 75%. If I’m right I expect a buff. If people just learn to live with it, my grappling days are over.
                Yes, but we know how Respawn works, it will take at least 1 month for the next update.
                    But at least show them we don't approve. At all. I was a Path main. Been using Rev for a little while cause his ult. I use Path from time to time when i want a really good game, but now... he's not even worth it. I could deal with 20sec maybe 25. But damn. Just wtf?
                        Yes, a 20 second cooldown would be difficult to adapt, but a killing nerf like this one is too much to take, i *really* tried to make it work but no, he is useless now. I'm so angry right now, fuck Respawn and his shitty balancing.
                    What I'm thinking is they purposely raised it to 35 knowing people would complain, then they lower it again and everyone will be fine with it because at least it's lower than 35
                        this is so right..  dev's playing chess redditor's playing checkers
            This, i was playing with a friend and he was downed at the top of a small house , after the fight was over he was expecting me to climb with my grapple the small house, i said "hey man, i usually would have used my grapple to revive you, but with the 35 second cooldown could you please drop down?", i felt so ridiculous static.
        Dont play path. If we don’t play path they will see we don’t like it then they will change it so more play him
    As a Pathfinder main, im the big sad
    I just want to sweeng
    Really true honestly, his hit box is still shit and he has the low profile perk, so he’s both easy to hit and he takes more damage. And now, his mobility is practically deleted for fun fights, which means he will have to position like everyone else, by walking. The only thing he has going for him is the zip line really, and the beacons.
But his passive is also very strong in fights tho /s
It’s the kind of throw shit at the wall and see what sticks antics that are starting to bore me. 

They are knee jerk to what they sub demand and they seem to throw things like this out with little indication that it has been tested thoroughly and thought out. 

Hopefully it will be hot fixed in 2 weeks or less.
    I think you might be forgetting how much internal data they have to calculate optimal buffs and nerfs. They aren't making decisions based on the slew of anecdotal complaints, they literally have the sum of in game actions to inform them. They have to consider how everything balances in a complicated, dynamic system and they have way more data than any of us to make these decisions.

I mean y'all are complaining and the update has been live for like, a few hours. Let's see how it goes first.
        [deleted]
            I mean based off what you just said it seems like they don't base all their decisions off what the community wants and instead bases them off something else, that something else probably being data like pick rate for legends, overall kdr for legends, how they perform in professional play etc.
Its so Path mains try out Loba, her tactical provides similar repositioning but on a faster CD. And she doesn't have Low-Profile.
They literally made the most fun character useless to play.
Same. Awful.
ofcourse not, they just changed Pathfinder to a human and gave him a female gender
    I'd smash
        especially if she had the same voice
            Who wants to bang on a zip line?
                Waiting for r34 pathy
            ONLY if he has the same voice
    They also gave him a wheelchair and blinded him just for good luck
for comparison, octane gets his full ult back in the time it takes you to get 2 hooks
    I'm glad octane's ult is super fast, but my boi mathfinder needs his hook
        He finds all the maths questions
            But he still can't find his creator :(
                Bro, too soon.. we’re already dealing with this grapple nonsense
                oof
            short for mathew
        2 + 2 is 4, minus 1 that's 3, quick hook!

*Mathfinder*
    Imagine nerfing an ability so hard that it has nearly as much cooldown as an ULT
        Imagine having an ult that's ultimately less usefull than an ability
        Wraith mains: First time?
    For comparison, octane gets to awkwardly jump while pathfinder has an ability that puts him on par with *titan pilots* from titanfall 2

Well deserved nerf. Though 30 seconds would’ve been better so people don’t abandon ship because of a “dead legend” bandwagon
It’s no longer a movement option now
    Yup it's an ability that needs to be saved for a fight, can't use it while traversing.

You use it once during a fight. To get into a fight, to relocate during a fight or to escape a fight. 

Traversing with him was a huge plus, without that I'll just play someone with a useful passive and a tactical I can use more than once a fight.
        what's the cooldown on other mobility legends?

Wraith's and Loba's Q abilities

I mean if I can teleport faster than Pathfinder can hook... there is a balancing issue
        >Traversing

Was the only reason I played this game, felt so freeing, especially for a disabled person. 

Why not buff other champs (oh wait they did).

Or make an item on the map that has a single use grappling hook for EVERYONE and let pathfinder keep his 15 sec cd.

I uninstalled origin and apex.
Imagine you accidentally fuckup a grappling hook and waiting half the time it takes for an ultimate. How absurd.
    Maybe if you immediately let go of your hook the cooldown should be fourthed
        A lot of path mains tap and release the grapple to leap high into the air, so that would end up breaking the game even more for them (35/4 < 15)
I tried him in firing range and just kept saying to myself “What the hell I STILL can’t grapple yet” sad day friends
    [deleted]
        there is balancing and then there is murder... If I were to do a Tier list of all Legends I would probably not even put him in

Others: hey you forgot Pathfinder in your list

Me: No, I didn't forget him.
            [deleted]
                I assume Gibby is still complete bullshit to fight. I dropped the game because I'm sick of BRs and I don't think these questionable balance decisions make me want to return.
[removed]
    
Instead of making him faster they just Made everyone else slower,i hate that decition tbh
Yeah he was my most played legend in Season 4. Now back to Mirage lol
    Same. He quickly became my favorite after I mained Life then Gibby. I fell in love with that mobility! Oh well, Loba looks sick
        Lol loba and mirage probably this season
            Saaame. Mirage is SO good now and I’ve been wanting to main him for awhile but he was never the best.. and Loba’s teleport.. so fun.
        [deleted]
            Hella facts
            Girl thicker than a bowl of oatmeal
This is a passive buff to Octane.
    I told the same to my brother, and that fast heal being vaulted is a buff to lifeline as she’s the only character who has it built in now
        Im actually fine with that nerf. U got a gold armor? Toss the bat and the med kit and keep the small ones. And now people are gonna use the evo more
        Well, Gibby and everyone inside his dome do too, but passively yeah, only Lifeline. She could use a more direct buff though, in my opinion.
It just confuses me why they spend literally like 6 months making not a single change to him and then decide at once "yeah lets just increase his most fun, iconic ability cooldown by 135%"

Their approach to balance is so weird
    Bad Path mains are super fucked now. You can’t afford to miss a grapple.
        I mean that was already the case. If you miss a grapple on even a 10 second cooldown that's still a big window to get dove. The difference between 15 seconds and 35 seconds isn't the difference between dying or not, it just prevents you from using the character for scouting and makes it less fun to play in pubs/ranked, and means you have fewer opportunities to push people.

Basically grapple is reserved as an oh-shit button now.

Good path mains are ditching the character now. Best Pathfinder players in the world are about to be maining Gibby or Caustic now
            Yeah I will no longer main path. His only attribute to truly help the team is gone. They totally fucked this up imo. A 20-25 MAX second cool down would’ve been fine, but most fights only last a minute. So for us path mains who knew how to jump in, hit damage on all of the enemy team, jump back out to heal so your boys can either take them out the rest of the way or at least hold them so you can get back in, days are over. He’s honestly kind of a pointless legend now... which hurts to say about my zippy boi :’( Looks like the move is to bloodhound or Loba. Guess I’ll find out... RIP my brother path mains...
            So basically in line with wraith and octane instead of a complete tier above.

>	Basically grapple is reserved as an oh-shit button now.
            I have 45,000 kills on Pathfinder and I’m like actually in shock they would more than double his grapple time. I feel way to invested to switch mains so I just need to adapt to using the grapple less frequently.
    They did the same in Titanfall 2, nerfed grapple pilots through the floor, then after about 3 months of community uproar (grapple was one of the most fun things in the game), reverted it to its original state
    in season 3 they decreased the grapple's velocity. making his grapple slightly slower. then in season 4 I think they did increase it from 11second cool down to 15.
    After making his low profile take regular damage to limbs.ugh.
        This is what I’m saying... the least they could have done is taken low profile off. Or like give us 10-20 dmg for grappling an enemy, take away gas damage... SOMETHING
            Make it so grappled enemies cant shoot you or you can shoot them :p
    Wait, they balance things in this game?
Bro They are trying to nerf pathfinder to the ground.
    Yes I have my tinfoil hat on... but think about this: They nerfed PF like this because they want you to force into Loba = Teleport aka. Mobility Skill
        maybe it was to drive hardcore pathfinder mains back to titanfall 2 where we all ... ahem ... they all belong!
    Not even the ground.  They nerfed him to the goddamn Mariana Trench.
        With low profile. He is now the worst legend in the game lmao fml
If they had changed to 25secs, people would have asked for 18secs.

They will reduce it to 25 eventually.
    20 seconds was okay, i have in mind is the only tactical in the game that breaks the verticallity of the map(before Loba of course), but with low profile and now keep standing for so long i will find very difficult to max path's utility, it will be a challenge, i will know how playing an off-meta legend feels lol.
    Exactly, and his grabble nerf is long overdue, it’s about time


Wish they buffed or reworked lifeline’s ult tho :(
        His ult needs a buff though... half the time it wont lemme shoot the zip or it wont go where it says its sposed to
            His ult should def just stick to anything not tagged OOB imo.
15 was annoyingly slow for me to ever have fun using him. Was it over powered? Maybe. But 35 is complete fucking shit. It's close to having ultimate levels of cooldown.
    [deleted]
        Yeah dude. Looking at it from this point of view just shows how messed up this shit is
        Exactly. They also cut Octane's jump pad cool down by 30 seconds.
    You thought 15 seconds was slow? Holy shit.
        When you come from TF|2 it is. I could never use path without thinking about how bad he feels compared to a grapple pilot.
            When I first started, I was less concerned with the cooldown and more with the range.
            I mean every legend is weak as hell compared to a pilot. Bloodhound tactical versus the darts? Octane stim versus the stim? It makes sense with the balance of the game even if it is sad. When everyone can't have grapple it's not really fair to have a super fast grapple on just one character.
Now you know how us Lifeline mains feel when they released that Low Profile Buff lol
    And when Gibby came through
        Gibby literally devoured all of lifelines abilities for himself.
This is direct correlation with introducing Loba. She has  movement so they want us to try her. But 35 seconds is ridiculous, it’s should be somewhere around 15-25 seconds. I mean his zip line and his passive isn’t that useful, so why even touch his grapple?! I literally never saw even one person complaining about his grapple.
    Really? You never saw anyone complaining about one of the most complained about abilities in this sub? I can barely read a thread without 2 or 3 "nerf the grapple" posts.
Yea his grapple is basically useless now
    He's useless in general now, oh you can see where the next ring is? Good luck getting there with your one Zipline and ultimate grapple cooldown

Edit: Useless is a stretch, but as a loyal path main, I'm a bit hurt.
        The only reason I was playing Pathfinder was because of how fun he was to zip around the map, but now I don't dare do that, you never know when the next fight starts and you gotta wait 35 seconds to get in/out
            That is the problem, but I don't wanna get bashed anymore about "oh, he's just complaining" when it's like, Pathfinders thing to be swingy boi. It's a fast paced legend for a fast paced game. it's what sets him APART from all the other legends.
        It's a safety valve now, not a means of consistent transport.    Not a fan.
            Same dude, same.
Skulltown it is, my friends!!.... oh wait.
    For some reason you can hear this while reading it
That was my first thought, too. He's good playing as other legends but god damn were his grapples fun to watch. I'm betting he's going to start maining another legend now.
    Yeah, but he's actually great in-fight. He doesn't use his grapples to escape unless absolutely necessary. He's going to be fine with this nerf I think
        I think they just put it on par with Loba and Wraith's Tactical mobility skill

basically what they have done to pathfinder is to change the utility of the ability. they want the ability to be used as a tactical maneuver (do it once, make it count) and not as a mobility tool.  

the real mobility god is Octane.
Back to Bangalore
[deleted]
    Hes so good on apex
They did it again and it just killed ALL hype for season 5, Im not playing until it gets reverted and ive invested so much time into the game.

-sad Boxing Gloves 13k path main
from same makers too right? like they couldn't wait to pull this shit again
    Yep same people, I thought they would have learnt after everyone on tf2 told them it was a horrible idea and respawn changed it back really quickly. I even remember the patch notes when it was reverted saying something along the lines of them admitting they made a mistake for punishing fun.
        i'm thinking that they wanted to change the role completely of pathfinder.

From the Legends, the mobility god should be Octane. not pathfinder. 

they wanted to change his hook from being a mobility tool, to be a tactical skill. (use it once, make it count)
            well octane certainly is the mobility god now. Except they killed the rabbit to make way for the turtle...
They better revert it. They did it with the ring after they quadrupled the damage, you couldnt even survive getting caught in the first ring for a short time and they lost so many players from it, so they improved it. This is as stupid of an update
Even 25 sec is a big nerf of 10 seconds but would be fair
Imagine not reading the patch notes and hopping in a game as pathfinder. I was so confused and then angry after I realized what happened.
    It's a big sad because you have to either change your playstyle entirely or pick another legend
It's hard to balance the mobility that hook provides, sometimes nerfs are just necessary

that said, I'm on team 25s
    >It's hard to balance the mobility that hook provides,

And loba can throw her tactical 75 m away with 29 seconds cooldown. But 25 m grapple is the problem.
        You act like path only goes 25m

A good arc can send you way further than that
            Teleporting 75 meters away in a second is safer than a good arc. You can shoot a path while it is arcing.
                you can shoot loba while she's aiming her bracelet and waiting for it to land too, if you want to argue semantics here
                And you can shoot Loba while she's throwing her wrist and landing
        Lmao you can go a lot farther than 25M with the grapple.

Also the grapple has maneuverability which allows you to do some pretty crazy plays.


I agree they went a little heavy handed with the grapple, I'd be fine with the CD if they gave the grapple 2 charges with the 35 second CD or lowered it to 25-27 seconds.
            Charges would be so nice.
        Though it's probably to early to tell, on the surface grapple seems way better. Loba's tp has to reach its destination first before she moves. Pathy starts flying 0.3 seconds after pressing Q.
            And she's very slow as it's flying
They did lol, mirage got a mad buff
    After like 8 months of needing one.
        he still got one though, youre saying after 8 months as if it completely invalidates his rework
You can't just endlessly buff everything, it will become a shitshow. I expect the cooldown to descrease, but the nerf itself is justified. Going from 15 to 35 is a hell of a drop tho
    The nerf is justified, but I feel like 20-25 seconds would be a little more reasonable.
Grabbing 2-3 times a fight and flying in the air and reposition like that when ever is convenient is OP, wraith can escape with her tactical once a team fight and she should time it perfectly so should pathfinder players
    It wouldn’t be OP if the other legends had better abilities to match
        The difference is that Pathfinder's abilities fit the meta of quick and strategic positioning. Good positioning and fast movement is something that counteracted most abilities. Even if the lower tier legends were buffed, Pathfinder would still be a must have.
I think you hit the nail on the head. The balancing in this game is fucked
You speak 100% truth. They don't give a shit about balance, they only do this to mix up the Meta without having to actually do anything between seasons.
Lmao fuck anyone that paid money for skins or his heirloom amirite
>  I'm just frustrated that we'll have to play a season with Gimpfinder because of a massive overnerf. 

I won't, I uninstalled the game and origin.
Respawn: Wraiths, Pathfinders, Wattsons and Lifelines are fun characters to play? Not on our watch!!
Because its Respawn's method - kneejerk reaction with no consideration of how the players might feel. They never just slightly nerf or slightly buff anything - if something is overpowered they nerf it so hard literally nobody will use it, and if its underpowered they shoot it straight up to god-tier. They're basically throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks, only they don't actually care what sticks they just hope that it does.
My English teacher is would be proud.
Like I don't want to switch legend as I've bought stuff for him n have all my stats on him and I really do still love the grapple in concept :/
    I didn't buy stuff but i have all my stats on him as well, and i actually played him today, you have to think very tactically with the grapple instead of having fun with it :(
        Its not even that you have to just think tactically you had to do that anyway now you just don't get to use it when you want lol.
        Honestly it's like should I use it now? But what if I need it again...and yeah the fun of slingshotting urself along can't be beat
            Exactly i used to grapple going in fights, escaping fights, going up somewhere, dropping from a high place to cancel that pause when u hut the ground, grapple the ground and launch myself just for fun, now it's for escaping fights only :(
                They've ruined one of the most fun to play video game characters ever made :(
Yeah, i always thought that pathfinder's mobility really depends on the player, some are skilled with it and some aren't (like me) but i never found it particularly over powered, 35 seconds seems a little bit too much for me
Pathfinder is literally the last character I would have thought be pissed off about. It's not like he can peek with a personal shield behind another dome shield then battle res while blowing you to bits.  


But oh nooooo that one thing that Pathfinder can do is too OP in a firefight.
its reddit so naturally the vocal minority comes out to voice their claims and it gets upvoted as if its popular and widely held opinion
There’s no running from a bloodthirsty Pathfinder.
    Seriously you fight out one pathfinder on a rooftop and then hear the grapple noise behind you...
loba gonna do that now. she can even port through fenced windows and stuff
    Her tac wait is longer and the animation isn’t great for pushing engagements
        Thats the thing. Lobas tactical isnt really an effective escape method, its better for flanking or fast travel. 

Paths grapple is good for all of those things plus pretty much any other situation in the game.
> getting out of every engagement they're losing 

True I only wish Bang would get the same treatment, x2 smokes at 32 second cooldown is just as annoying.
    Except threat sights make her smoke useless.
Good thing is I won't be stuck running around as a solo when my squad gets wiped...cause I'll get caught too. :(
My favorite is taking a long drop late in the game and see what looks like a spiderweb from some multi-team pathfinder nonsense below.
Ya, I think 25 is the sweet spot. 35 is a death sentence
    35 is just criminal.  He's one of their flagship characters and they've massacred him.
        I feel like limiting mobility for a lo pro legend is never a good idea. Thats why ppl not using lifeline anymore, need to be able to move if ur a lo pro
    No, 0 is the sweet spot. I need to have a grapple on both arms with no recharge time, so I can fly around like spiderman.
I always thought CDR stood for Cool Down Reduction.
Loba is the new path. That tactical is insane.
    Dude it's not even about the tactical aspect it just just plain fun, It probably was way too powerful but Im not a pro player, and for me apex was all about fun, and my fav was pathfinder :/. And a little bit of love for apex dies today.
        That’s a very fair pov. Path has awesome voice lines and character model. Feels bad to have a legend that lost their identity. (I was hoping for 20 sec but 35 is craaaaaxy)
Fucking idiots.. grappling is literally the 9nly thing pathfinder can do
That's something I'd hoped they would do eventually. Give every character a grapple and make Pathfinder's grapple stronger since he specializes in it. I think everyone should get to enjoy the grapple mechanic in this game, the fast pace is precisely why I fell in love with Apex, and now it feels like they'd rather we camp rooftops with snipers.
This. End the suffering.
If we are running the two charge gang it would need to be a longer charge imo. Grapple in, PK shot, grapple out in 2s? That would be wildddd
    Pk? I've got some bad news for you brother...
        Don’t tell me
    You mean mastiff shot.
    It can have two charges, but give it a Spider-Man rule. The second charge is only usable during the flight of your first grapple; once you've touched the ground your cooldown begins.
Now im imagine him with grapples on both arms swinging from buildings like spiderman
There's no way in hell they picked 35 seconds for "balance". I doubt they even tested it. They just picked a huge number to try to kill Pathfinder.

Grapple has more maneuverability compared to bracelet.


Also it's a new legend it's supposed to be busted as hell so people buy her with apex coins and they make money lmao.
    I feel like 90% of the player base is buying her with Tokens instead of Coins.
        Still 10% of 10M+ playerbase is a lot of revenue.
            1 million people are not going to pay real money for Loba... come on.
    I’d be surprised if people bought her with coins. Most players are sitting on 50k+ legend tokens.
    Because Crypto and Rev were so busted on release?
Except wraith still goes invulnerable. Pathfinder is the size of a linebacker and can now ult less than twice a minute. These nerfs are not the same. Wraith is still highly viable and top tier. Path is non-competitive anymore. This is coming from a path main. He’s all I play, but now I’m fully off till they fix this cause it’s unplayable
    Sounds like every wraith main when they nerfed her.
        Wraith still had a borked hotbox in her favor, and a top tier passive and ulti. PFs ult is good, but janky to use and doesn't make you invulnerable, and down people can't use it like Wraiths. And his passive isn't even a passive. 

So pathfinder has:

Tallest/largest hitbox out of the low profile legends, an ultimate that is OK at best, a useless passive, and a now gutted tactical. 

The worst thing about this nerf is grapple was one of, if not THE most fun ability to use in the game. Phasing as Wraith isn't fun, it's just utility, but going fast as pathfinder and repositioning like spiderman was a huge source of FUN in this game. Now you just get to have less fun playing as pathfinder.

This isn't even like "it's fun to abuse grapple to win fights", more like it was just a fun ability to use. Now it will just... Not be fun.
            Remember when Gold Helmet gave you a grapple every 7 seconds?  ; u ;
    >Path is non-competitive anymore.   This is coming from a path main. He’s all I play, but now I’m fully off till they fix this cause it’s unplayable

Sounds like you're really openminded and not at all biased. I know you say Path main like it's some voice of reason, like it's that you'll know this change is bad without even playing. But that's not how it works.

Give it more than 1 hour. You guys remind me of the Starcraft redditors who would form an opinion based on theorycraft and knee-jerk reaction of patch notes. Right down to declaring it 'unplayable' and 'i'm quitting the game till they revert this'.

I've been reading these comments for the better part of a decade from Starcraft II players, and they're all always bullshit. Terran players who couldn't fathom playing with a nerfed MMM ball. The idea that Protoss players could actually survive without Khadarian Amulet or that Zerg players might actually be able to deal with changes.

*Have you even played the game since the patch notes?* Or are you already declaring it unplayable because they happened to nerf the only character you play?

I see everyone making judgements based on a vacuum.

"Paths tactical takes this long vs  X legend's ult. "\^ This is not how you balance a game \^

You have to weigh the positives and negatives each ability/legend provides in-game. It's not just a numbers game that is "Well, paths tactical shouldn't take longer than this legends ability".

It could be bad. I'm open to the idea that they went too far, absolutely.

You might be right. They might end up even reverting it.  But I won't make that judgement without actually playing the game.  I wish more people would actually give it more time than it took them to read the notes and write a comment to judge these things.

Give it more than an hour. Play more than 2 games before calling it unplayable and quitting. I'm not saying you're wrong, I just wish you'd give it a chance because everyones gut reaction to their legend (or anything in any game) is "Well fuck I hate this change"

\-----------------------------

*Edit: Stop responding to me about your experience with at best a handful of games. I don't care. The patch hasn't been out a day and all I can hear is whine whine whine and comparing Pathfinders 20s+ longer cooldown to losing your fucking hand. LOL.*  You guys sure are dramatic! Imagine comparing losing a limb to only being able to use your grapple twice a minute instead of five times! I can't imagine the horror.

\------------------------------

Edit2: Time to turn off Replies. Too many sweaty Pathfinder mains playing 2 games and reporting back totally without bias about how awful this is, and how much of a dumbass I am for suggesting people wait 6 hours before complaining. How dare I complain about kneejerk complainers. I don't know why i'd expect rational levelheaded discussion when you guys just want to complain and namecall. Sorry I went against the grain and had the gall to suggest people actually wait more than 2 hours before making up their mind. Real sorry /s

3 grapples a minute (post patch) vs 5 grapples a minute

But don't worry, he's useless now. Totally non-competitive and not at all viable. Haven't you guys ever lost your hand?!?!?! /s

Yeah, that's enough of /r/apexlegends for me today. Can't wait to come back next week and find out you've all gotten used to it.
        Definitely not a path main. But I love the bot. He's definitely the reason I first fell in love with the movement in this game. 

The point is not that he needed a nerf. The point is that this is a significantly less fun change to the gameplay. Much like the wraith nerf was.

Whenever possible they should be buffing weak legends not nerfing strong legends.
            Same, I'm more annoyed the most fun character is now much less fun.
    Wraith is top tier because of her ult. Her tactical is a bonus, but isn’t the reason she’s used in competitive play.

Pathfinder’s tactical is stronger because you simply can’t chase after him, but you can still chase after a wraith and just shoot her once she’s out of phase. Path gets away faster and farther, and is a lot harder to kill than a sprinting target.
yes
😭
When the pick rate is like 60% it can only go down honestly.
More like missing the spot that he wanted. "Bad aim problems"
    Or when the grapple randomly lets go before you get moving.
        I fkn, hate that. Happens at least once every 3 games.
            Grapple breaks at >90 degrees, don't turn so wide
                Yeah if you turn your FOV above 90, you will be able to break the grapple while still seeing it, is why it feels like a bug.
Yes, it is

*Puts on patrol cap*
    Oh...so it is
        We better get inside, we are going to catch a cold
            Hey another me!
                Soon to be me too...
                    That hurt my soul
                        F for all the dedicated Path mains amigo
                            F......lets just hope they dont turn into TTV wraiths
                Shhhhh *whispers* you're ruining the reference!
        You're a jerk.  You made me think Tom Petty had died and somehow I missed it.
            Umm, he's been dead for a few years now
                ...

and now I'm sad : (
                    Yeah sorry I had to be the one to tell you
Underrated comment
I said to myself I wasn't gonna cry today...
Even sadder that Hughes’ VA passed away last month
Brotherhood? Nah, let's take a trip to 2003.
    Rewatching it currently. Why does that part have to hurt everytime!
        I don't know, but Elicia had a very good point, how do they expect Hughes to do his very important job if they bury him? That's a real oversight by the Amestris State Military.
            he had so much work to do. Thatd the part that hurts. His daughter not understanding. Then the second punch from Mustang as a stoic type character breaks down.
    This is the way.
        [deleted]
            Quick stop in 2018
    Brotherhood is better imo
        It’s def a better story structure but 03 has such a beautiful charm to it that I’ll always recommend to anyone interested in the show to watch 03 first then to brotherhood to appreciate more of what brotherhood improves on
        Overall yes, but the earlier chapters are more fleshed out in the original.
            Yeah, that's the big dif between the two for me - Hughes' death has so much more impact in the original because you have the time to actually get to know and like him and see him through the other characters' eyes. In Brotherhood his death is a shock and a galvanizing force for the others, but you don't get the same sense of tragedy and loss of a good man in a world that needs more of them.
                Exactly. I understand why Hughes had to go, though. His big brain was simply too OP. He already had everything figured out before it began.
There's nerfing and then there's being sent straight to trash-tier
    He didn't get sent to trash-tier

He got dumpstered so hard they made a new tier for it called pathfinder tier

Even octane is more popular now since he's one of the more mobile legends

Or he would if loba wasn't better than him still
        is octane bad?
im tryna pick up the game again for the first time since he was released and im addicted to pressing q to go fast
            Octane’s not actually bad, especially if you’re going to be playing on your own for a little while.  He’s just not great in terms of team interaction, most of the other characters bring something to the table for their teammates in one form or another, but Octane’s jumppad is somewhat limited and specific.  Although it’s more appealing now since the cool down was shortened and pathfinder will probably be less used.
                Octane is a ton of fun, but fuck me he's loud when using his stim. Every squad in the whole map can hear a stimmed octane running around.
                Octane can still be great for the team just depends on how you use his abilities

I like to use my boost to get in front of the team and use the bounce pad to jump up a cliff instead of having to climb it, or if someone is knocked due to storm I throw it in front of them so they get boosted towards safe zone, and if I’m feeling frisky (at the train) put the bounce pad on top of front car 👌🏼😩
            The meta just got thrown up in the air so nobody knows. But he's the legend I play, he's fun and has no real disadvantages, I say play him
                It’s funny because it a legend tier ranking, they basically said nothing wrong with fast-boi he just is a “worse version of pathfinder” mobility wise... now that all has changed so I can’t really think of a big negative to him
                Lets go!!!
            TLDR; No. But he could be (and soon™ will be) better.

His passive health regen still counteracts stim pretty well and will occasionally save you a syringe here and there. 

His stim speed boost is still nothing game changing. 

His jump pad has the potential to be really useful, especially with the new cooldown reduction (60 seconds). But you’ve got to realise what can and can’t be done with it (and have teammates that understand this too).

His head hitbox is hilariously bad (big) and hopefully got fixed this season - but the bugs have been so spicy I haven’t been able to test yet. 

Devs are planning more for him but it’s sadly looking like a few weeks/months still to go. 

I play him, wraith, and wattson an equal amount. He’s definitely the weakest of the three but I still had fun with him all throughout the last two seasons, even in ranked. 

You could come back in, pick him up, and still have fun.
            The thing is his kit doesn't do much

Sure he is decent but compare him to wraith,to pre-nerf pathfinder

Bangalore passive gives i think a bigger speed boost than octane (don't quote me on that) by just being shot at,not even hit
            Before the Pathfinder nerf he was a better octane than octane, a better revenant than revenant and a better loba than loba, but now loba, revenant and wraith are still better than octane at speed and they don't lose health.
                They don’t regen either js

Sure it’s slow, but can be better than using your only medkit/syringes
Lmaooooooo
*sniffles* i am......
    *In case you didn't know, you get here by winning.*
not ready yet bro, still in cooldown period.
:’( time to change my flair to octane....
    Yeah, looks like I'm switching back to Mirage :'(
What do you mean can’t play with her?
At least I get a jump pad every minute. Lmao.
    Luis voice lmao
I just got em on Friday. Feels bad, man. Mained Path since season 1. Still gonna play him, but this nerf hurts.
    Wait you guys are getting heirlooms?
        Been playing since S1, just got my 1st Heirloom ever lol
            Been playing since launch day 😭
                Me too, all battle passes even, still 0 heirloom shards
                Been playing since launch day too. :( we can die together
        i switched to pc a little over two weeks ago and bought 60 packs today to try and get a loba skin and pulled the heirloom shards lol
        HAH. At least your character *has* an heirloom.
After seeing Blizzard's approach at balancing Overwatch by banning a few Heroes each week, I don't think I'll ever believe "x has to know this". Some people are just that thick in the head.
    Blizzard would solve all their problems by removing hero switching and installing a draft but Nooooooooooooooo. They’ll do anything but that
        Overwatch doesn't have enough heroes for a draft. The same heroes would be banned every time
            yea, i sure wonder why those same heroes would be banned every single time
                For real though. This would fix a lot of problems. They left Brigitte OP for over 3 months before nerfing her, and she was still strong. Me and my friends dropped the game after Brigitte and just opening the game time to time makes me sick, it went downhill since the Moira launch. Hero ban would've at least made the game bearable.

It's even more annoying to know that this game won GOTY and had amazing potential. Now its just a mixed bag with shitty new heroes catered towards retarded gameplay like Wrecking Ball.
                    Fuck overwatch, unless you enjoy playing with people who leave 2 minutes into ranked and basically losing points then I’d stay away. Game is a fucking joke, get these fucking genii and widow mains every day who suck ass lol. Thank fuck for not having a draft, people playing tank and support have to pick the slack up
                        PREACH. That game is so needlessly toxic for how stupid it can be on a regular basis.
            Yes but it’ll increase the quality of the games soo much and provide urgent balancing data.
        That’s a fucking horrible idea lmao.  With how many different hard counters there are in Overwatch, and how rock-paper-scissors the game is in terms of both 1-on-1 matchups and entire team comps, a draft system would literally be “oh boy I hope to god they don’t have an X character on their team”.  There would be no adaptability or fluidity to the game, and it would become extremely fucking boring.
He’s gotten a lot of nerf’s, first there was the low profile nerf, next the grapple speed nerf, then limb damage is the same as body damage, and now this.  

I think it should’ve been around 20-25 seconds but if it stays like this I’ll learn to live with it
    > but if it stays like this I’ll learn to live with it

Same. Just going to have to use it more judiciously and make sure to pull off nice slingshots to cover ground quickly. Gone are the days of grappling up to places you could have easily just climbed.
        But now he sucks. That was the only reason to use Path. Movement. Don't learn to live with it... don't use him and bitch about it and they will fix it. If no one uses him due to being useless, they will fix it.
            That's what I'm hoping people will do, I'm sure not gonna use him now
                Especially since our new legend can fucking *teleport*
            I’ve only played since s4 and I was a solo path main until the Revenant buffs and I’ve tried him the past 2 weeks as well. I’m SO glad I got comfortable with someone else, I absolutely REFUSE 35 second cool down with no other improvements to go with. 

I told my homie I expect path usage to go down by a solid 75%. If I’m right I expect a buff. If people just learn to live with it, my grappling days are over.
            Yes, but we know how Respawn works, it will take at least 1 month for the next update.
                But at least show them we don't approve. At all. I was a Path main. Been using Rev for a little while cause his ult. I use Path from time to time when i want a really good game, but now... he's not even worth it. I could deal with 20sec maybe 25. But damn. Just wtf?
                    Yes, a 20 second cooldown would be difficult to adapt, but a killing nerf like this one is too much to take, i *really* tried to make it work but no, he is useless now. I'm so angry right now, fuck Respawn and his shitty balancing.
                What I'm thinking is they purposely raised it to 35 knowing people would complain, then they lower it again and everyone will be fine with it because at least it's lower than 35
                    this is so right..  dev's playing chess redditor's playing checkers
        This, i was playing with a friend and he was downed at the top of a small house , after the fight was over he was expecting me to climb with my grapple the small house, i said "hey man, i usually would have used my grapple to revive you, but with the 35 second cooldown could you please drop down?", i felt so ridiculous static.
    Dont play path. If we don’t play path they will see we don’t like it then they will change it so more play him
As a Pathfinder main, im the big sad
I just want to sweeng
Really true honestly, his hit box is still shit and he has the low profile perk, so he’s both easy to hit and he takes more damage. And now, his mobility is practically deleted for fun fights, which means he will have to position like everyone else, by walking. The only thing he has going for him is the zip line really, and the beacons.
I think you might be forgetting how much internal data they have to calculate optimal buffs and nerfs. They aren't making decisions based on the slew of anecdotal complaints, they literally have the sum of in game actions to inform them. They have to consider how everything balances in a complicated, dynamic system and they have way more data than any of us to make these decisions.

I mean y'all are complaining and the update has been live for like, a few hours. Let's see how it goes first.
    [deleted]
        I mean based off what you just said it seems like they don't base all their decisions off what the community wants and instead bases them off something else, that something else probably being data like pick rate for legends, overall kdr for legends, how they perform in professional play etc.
I'd smash
    especially if she had the same voice
        Who wants to bang on a zip line?
            Waiting for r34 pathy
        ONLY if he has the same voice
They also gave him a wheelchair and blinded him just for good luck
I'm glad octane's ult is super fast, but my boi mathfinder needs his hook
    He finds all the maths questions
        But he still can't find his creator :(
            Bro, too soon.. we’re already dealing with this grapple nonsense
            oof
        short for mathew
    2 + 2 is 4, minus 1 that's 3, quick hook!

*Mathfinder*
Imagine nerfing an ability so hard that it has nearly as much cooldown as an ULT
    Imagine having an ult that's ultimately less usefull than an ability
    Wraith mains: First time?
For comparison, octane gets to awkwardly jump while pathfinder has an ability that puts him on par with *titan pilots* from titanfall 2

Well deserved nerf. Though 30 seconds would’ve been better so people don’t abandon ship because of a “dead legend” bandwagon
Yup it's an ability that needs to be saved for a fight, can't use it while traversing.

You use it once during a fight. To get into a fight, to relocate during a fight or to escape a fight. 

Traversing with him was a huge plus, without that I'll just play someone with a useful passive and a tactical I can use more than once a fight.
    what's the cooldown on other mobility legends?

Wraith's and Loba's Q abilities

I mean if I can teleport faster than Pathfinder can hook... there is a balancing issue
    >Traversing

Was the only reason I played this game, felt so freeing, especially for a disabled person. 

Why not buff other champs (oh wait they did).

Or make an item on the map that has a single use grappling hook for EVERYONE and let pathfinder keep his 15 sec cd.

I uninstalled origin and apex.
Maybe if you immediately let go of your hook the cooldown should be fourthed
    A lot of path mains tap and release the grapple to leap high into the air, so that would end up breaking the game even more for them (35/4 < 15)
[deleted]
    there is balancing and then there is murder... If I were to do a Tier list of all Legends I would probably not even put him in

Others: hey you forgot Pathfinder in your list

Me: No, I didn't forget him.
        [deleted]
            I assume Gibby is still complete bullshit to fight. I dropped the game because I'm sick of BRs and I don't think these questionable balance decisions make me want to return.

Instead of making him faster they just Made everyone else slower,i hate that decition tbh
Same. He quickly became my favorite after I mained Life then Gibby. I fell in love with that mobility! Oh well, Loba looks sick
    Lol loba and mirage probably this season
        Saaame. Mirage is SO good now and I’ve been wanting to main him for awhile but he was never the best.. and Loba’s teleport.. so fun.
    [deleted]
        Hella facts
        Girl thicker than a bowl of oatmeal
I told the same to my brother, and that fast heal being vaulted is a buff to lifeline as she’s the only character who has it built in now
    Im actually fine with that nerf. U got a gold armor? Toss the bat and the med kit and keep the small ones. And now people are gonna use the evo more
    Well, Gibby and everyone inside his dome do too, but passively yeah, only Lifeline. She could use a more direct buff though, in my opinion.
Bad Path mains are super fucked now. You can’t afford to miss a grapple.
    I mean that was already the case. If you miss a grapple on even a 10 second cooldown that's still a big window to get dove. The difference between 15 seconds and 35 seconds isn't the difference between dying or not, it just prevents you from using the character for scouting and makes it less fun to play in pubs/ranked, and means you have fewer opportunities to push people.

Basically grapple is reserved as an oh-shit button now.

Good path mains are ditching the character now. Best Pathfinder players in the world are about to be maining Gibby or Caustic now
        Yeah I will no longer main path. His only attribute to truly help the team is gone. They totally fucked this up imo. A 20-25 MAX second cool down would’ve been fine, but most fights only last a minute. So for us path mains who knew how to jump in, hit damage on all of the enemy team, jump back out to heal so your boys can either take them out the rest of the way or at least hold them so you can get back in, days are over. He’s honestly kind of a pointless legend now... which hurts to say about my zippy boi :’( Looks like the move is to bloodhound or Loba. Guess I’ll find out... RIP my brother path mains...
        So basically in line with wraith and octane instead of a complete tier above.

>	Basically grapple is reserved as an oh-shit button now.
        I have 45,000 kills on Pathfinder and I’m like actually in shock they would more than double his grapple time. I feel way to invested to switch mains so I just need to adapt to using the grapple less frequently.
They did the same in Titanfall 2, nerfed grapple pilots through the floor, then after about 3 months of community uproar (grapple was one of the most fun things in the game), reverted it to its original state
in season 3 they decreased the grapple's velocity. making his grapple slightly slower. then in season 4 I think they did increase it from 11second cool down to 15.
After making his low profile take regular damage to limbs.ugh.
    This is what I’m saying... the least they could have done is taken low profile off. Or like give us 10-20 dmg for grappling an enemy, take away gas damage... SOMETHING
        Make it so grappled enemies cant shoot you or you can shoot them :p
Wait, they balance things in this game?
Yes I have my tinfoil hat on... but think about this: They nerfed PF like this because they want you to force into Loba = Teleport aka. Mobility Skill
    maybe it was to drive hardcore pathfinder mains back to titanfall 2 where we all ... ahem ... they all belong!
Not even the ground.  They nerfed him to the goddamn Mariana Trench.
    With low profile. He is now the worst legend in the game lmao fml
20 seconds was okay, i have in mind is the only tactical in the game that breaks the verticallity of the map(before Loba of course), but with low profile and now keep standing for so long i will find very difficult to max path's utility, it will be a challenge, i will know how playing an off-meta legend feels lol.
Exactly, and his grabble nerf is long overdue, it’s about time


Wish they buffed or reworked lifeline’s ult tho :(
    His ult needs a buff though... half the time it wont lemme shoot the zip or it wont go where it says its sposed to
        His ult should def just stick to anything not tagged OOB imo.
[deleted]
    Yeah dude. Looking at it from this point of view just shows how messed up this shit is
    Exactly. They also cut Octane's jump pad cool down by 30 seconds.
You thought 15 seconds was slow? Holy shit.
    When you come from TF|2 it is. I could never use path without thinking about how bad he feels compared to a grapple pilot.
        When I first started, I was less concerned with the cooldown and more with the range.
        I mean every legend is weak as hell compared to a pilot. Bloodhound tactical versus the darts? Octane stim versus the stim? It makes sense with the balance of the game even if it is sad. When everyone can't have grapple it's not really fair to have a super fast grapple on just one character.
And when Gibby came through
    Gibby literally devoured all of lifelines abilities for himself.
Really? You never saw anyone complaining about one of the most complained about abilities in this sub? I can barely read a thread without 2 or 3 "nerf the grapple" posts.
He's useless in general now, oh you can see where the next ring is? Good luck getting there with your one Zipline and ultimate grapple cooldown

Edit: Useless is a stretch, but as a loyal path main, I'm a bit hurt.
    The only reason I was playing Pathfinder was because of how fun he was to zip around the map, but now I don't dare do that, you never know when the next fight starts and you gotta wait 35 seconds to get in/out
        That is the problem, but I don't wanna get bashed anymore about "oh, he's just complaining" when it's like, Pathfinders thing to be swingy boi. It's a fast paced legend for a fast paced game. it's what sets him APART from all the other legends.
    It's a safety valve now, not a means of consistent transport.    Not a fan.
        Same dude, same.
For some reason you can hear this while reading it
Yeah, but he's actually great in-fight. He doesn't use his grapples to escape unless absolutely necessary. He's going to be fine with this nerf I think
    I think they just put it on par with Loba and Wraith's Tactical mobility skill

basically what they have done to pathfinder is to change the utility of the ability. they want the ability to be used as a tactical maneuver (do it once, make it count) and not as a mobility tool.  

the real mobility god is Octane.
Hes so good on apex
Yep same people, I thought they would have learnt after everyone on tf2 told them it was a horrible idea and respawn changed it back really quickly. I even remember the patch notes when it was reverted saying something along the lines of them admitting they made a mistake for punishing fun.
    i'm thinking that they wanted to change the role completely of pathfinder.

From the Legends, the mobility god should be Octane. not pathfinder. 

they wanted to change his hook from being a mobility tool, to be a tactical skill. (use it once, make it count)
        well octane certainly is the mobility god now. Except they killed the rabbit to make way for the turtle...
It's a big sad because you have to either change your playstyle entirely or pick another legend
>It's hard to balance the mobility that hook provides,

And loba can throw her tactical 75 m away with 29 seconds cooldown. But 25 m grapple is the problem.
    You act like path only goes 25m

A good arc can send you way further than that
        Teleporting 75 meters away in a second is safer than a good arc. You can shoot a path while it is arcing.
            you can shoot loba while she's aiming her bracelet and waiting for it to land too, if you want to argue semantics here
            And you can shoot Loba while she's throwing her wrist and landing
    Lmao you can go a lot farther than 25M with the grapple.

Also the grapple has maneuverability which allows you to do some pretty crazy plays.


I agree they went a little heavy handed with the grapple, I'd be fine with the CD if they gave the grapple 2 charges with the 35 second CD or lowered it to 25-27 seconds.
        Charges would be so nice.
    Though it's probably to early to tell, on the surface grapple seems way better. Loba's tp has to reach its destination first before she moves. Pathy starts flying 0.3 seconds after pressing Q.
        And she's very slow as it's flying
After like 8 months of needing one.
    he still got one though, youre saying after 8 months as if it completely invalidates his rework
The nerf is justified, but I feel like 20-25 seconds would be a little more reasonable.
It wouldn’t be OP if the other legends had better abilities to match
    The difference is that Pathfinder's abilities fit the meta of quick and strategic positioning. Good positioning and fast movement is something that counteracted most abilities. Even if the lower tier legends were buffed, Pathfinder would still be a must have.
I didn't buy stuff but i have all my stats on him as well, and i actually played him today, you have to think very tactically with the grapple instead of having fun with it :(
    Its not even that you have to just think tactically you had to do that anyway now you just don't get to use it when you want lol.
    Honestly it's like should I use it now? But what if I need it again...and yeah the fun of slingshotting urself along can't be beat
        Exactly i used to grapple going in fights, escaping fights, going up somewhere, dropping from a high place to cancel that pause when u hut the ground, grapple the ground and launch myself just for fun, now it's for escaping fights only :(
            They've ruined one of the most fun to play video game characters ever made :(
Seriously you fight out one pathfinder on a rooftop and then hear the grapple noise behind you...
Her tac wait is longer and the animation isn’t great for pushing engagements
    Thats the thing. Lobas tactical isnt really an effective escape method, its better for flanking or fast travel. 

Paths grapple is good for all of those things plus pretty much any other situation in the game.
Except threat sights make her smoke useless.
35 is just criminal.  He's one of their flagship characters and they've massacred him.
    I feel like limiting mobility for a lo pro legend is never a good idea. Thats why ppl not using lifeline anymore, need to be able to move if ur a lo pro
No, 0 is the sweet spot. I need to have a grapple on both arms with no recharge time, so I can fly around like spiderman.
Dude it's not even about the tactical aspect it just just plain fun, It probably was way too powerful but Im not a pro player, and for me apex was all about fun, and my fav was pathfinder :/. And a little bit of love for apex dies today.
    That’s a very fair pov. Path has awesome voice lines and character model. Feels bad to have a legend that lost their identity. (I was hoping for 20 sec but 35 is craaaaaxy)
Pk? I've got some bad news for you brother...
    Don’t tell me
You mean mastiff shot.
It can have two charges, but give it a Spider-Man rule. The second charge is only usable during the flight of your first grapple; once you've touched the ground your cooldown begins.
F
I feel like 90% of the player base is buying her with Tokens instead of Coins.
    Still 10% of 10M+ playerbase is a lot of revenue.
        1 million people are not going to pay real money for Loba... come on.
I’d be surprised if people bought her with coins. Most players are sitting on 50k+ legend tokens.
Because Crypto and Rev were so busted on release?
Sounds like every wraith main when they nerfed her.
    Wraith still had a borked hotbox in her favor, and a top tier passive and ulti. PFs ult is good, but janky to use and doesn't make you invulnerable, and down people can't use it like Wraiths. And his passive isn't even a passive. 

So pathfinder has:

Tallest/largest hitbox out of the low profile legends, an ultimate that is OK at best, a useless passive, and a now gutted tactical. 

The worst thing about this nerf is grapple was one of, if not THE most fun ability to use in the game. Phasing as Wraith isn't fun, it's just utility, but going fast as pathfinder and repositioning like spiderman was a huge source of FUN in this game. Now you just get to have less fun playing as pathfinder.

This isn't even like "it's fun to abuse grapple to win fights", more like it was just a fun ability to use. Now it will just... Not be fun.
        Remember when Gold Helmet gave you a grapple every 7 seconds?  ; u ;
>Path is non-competitive anymore.   This is coming from a path main. He’s all I play, but now I’m fully off till they fix this cause it’s unplayable

Sounds like you're really openminded and not at all biased. I know you say Path main like it's some voice of reason, like it's that you'll know this change is bad without even playing. But that's not how it works.

Give it more than 1 hour. You guys remind me of the Starcraft redditors who would form an opinion based on theorycraft and knee-jerk reaction of patch notes. Right down to declaring it 'unplayable' and 'i'm quitting the game till they revert this'.

I've been reading these comments for the better part of a decade from Starcraft II players, and they're all always bullshit. Terran players who couldn't fathom playing with a nerfed MMM ball. The idea that Protoss players could actually survive without Khadarian Amulet or that Zerg players might actually be able to deal with changes.

*Have you even played the game since the patch notes?* Or are you already declaring it unplayable because they happened to nerf the only character you play?

I see everyone making judgements based on a vacuum.

"Paths tactical takes this long vs  X legend's ult. "\^ This is not how you balance a game \^

You have to weigh the positives and negatives each ability/legend provides in-game. It's not just a numbers game that is "Well, paths tactical shouldn't take longer than this legends ability".

It could be bad. I'm open to the idea that they went too far, absolutely.

You might be right. They might end up even reverting it.  But I won't make that judgement without actually playing the game.  I wish more people would actually give it more time than it took them to read the notes and write a comment to judge these things.

Give it more than an hour. Play more than 2 games before calling it unplayable and quitting. I'm not saying you're wrong, I just wish you'd give it a chance because everyones gut reaction to their legend (or anything in any game) is "Well fuck I hate this change"

\-----------------------------

*Edit: Stop responding to me about your experience with at best a handful of games. I don't care. The patch hasn't been out a day and all I can hear is whine whine whine and comparing Pathfinders 20s+ longer cooldown to losing your fucking hand. LOL.*  You guys sure are dramatic! Imagine comparing losing a limb to only being able to use your grapple twice a minute instead of five times! I can't imagine the horror.

\------------------------------

Edit2: Time to turn off Replies. Too many sweaty Pathfinder mains playing 2 games and reporting back totally without bias about how awful this is, and how much of a dumbass I am for suggesting people wait 6 hours before complaining. How dare I complain about kneejerk complainers. I don't know why i'd expect rational levelheaded discussion when you guys just want to complain and namecall. Sorry I went against the grain and had the gall to suggest people actually wait more than 2 hours before making up their mind. Real sorry /s

3 grapples a minute (post patch) vs 5 grapples a minute

But don't worry, he's useless now. Totally non-competitive and not at all viable. Haven't you guys ever lost your hand?!?!?! /s

Yeah, that's enough of /r/apexlegends for me today. Can't wait to come back next week and find out you've all gotten used to it.
    Definitely not a path main. But I love the bot. He's definitely the reason I first fell in love with the movement in this game. 

The point is not that he needed a nerf. The point is that this is a significantly less fun change to the gameplay. Much like the wraith nerf was.

Whenever possible they should be buffing weak legends not nerfing strong legends.
        Same, I'm more annoyed the most fun character is now much less fun.
Wraith is top tier because of her ult. Her tactical is a bonus, but isn’t the reason she’s used in competitive play.

Pathfinder’s tactical is stronger because you simply can’t chase after him, but you can still chase after a wraith and just shoot her once she’s out of phase. Path gets away faster and farther, and is a lot harder to kill than a sprinting target.
Or when the grapple randomly lets go before you get moving.
    I fkn, hate that. Happens at least once every 3 games.
        Grapple breaks at >90 degrees, don't turn so wide
            Yeah if you turn your FOV above 90, you will be able to break the grapple while still seeing it, is why it feels like a bug.
Oh...so it is
    We better get inside, we are going to catch a cold
        Hey another me!
            Soon to be me too...
                That hurt my soul
                    F for all the dedicated Path mains amigo
                        F......lets just hope they dont turn into TTV wraiths
            Shhhhh *whispers* you're ruining the reference!
    You're a jerk.  You made me think Tom Petty had died and somehow I missed it.
        Umm, he's been dead for a few years now
            ...

and now I'm sad : (
                Yeah sorry I had to be the one to tell you
Rewatching it currently. Why does that part have to hurt everytime!
    I don't know, but Elicia had a very good point, how do they expect Hughes to do his very important job if they bury him? That's a real oversight by the Amestris State Military.
        he had so much work to do. Thatd the part that hurts. His daughter not understanding. Then the second punch from Mustang as a stoic type character breaks down.
This is the way.

        Quick stop in 2018
Brotherhood is better imo
    It’s def a better story structure but 03 has such a beautiful charm to it that I’ll always recommend to anyone interested in the show to watch 03 first then to brotherhood to appreciate more of what brotherhood improves on
    Overall yes, but the earlier chapters are more fleshed out in the original.
        Yeah, that's the big dif between the two for me - Hughes' death has so much more impact in the original because you have the time to actually get to know and like him and see him through the other characters' eyes. In Brotherhood his death is a shock and a galvanizing force for the others, but you don't get the same sense of tragedy and loss of a good man in a world that needs more of them.
            Exactly. I understand why Hughes had to go, though. His big brain was simply too OP. He already had everything figured out before it began.
He didn't get sent to trash-tier

He got dumpstered so hard they made a new tier for it called pathfinder tier

Even octane is more popular now since he's one of the more mobile legends

Or he would if loba wasn't better than him still
    is octane bad?
im tryna pick up the game again for the first time since he was released and im addicted to pressing q to go fast
        Octane’s not actually bad, especially if you’re going to be playing on your own for a little while.  He’s just not great in terms of team interaction, most of the other characters bring something to the table for their teammates in one form or another, but Octane’s jumppad is somewhat limited and specific.  Although it’s more appealing now since the cool down was shortened and pathfinder will probably be less used.
            Octane is a ton of fun, but fuck me he's loud when using his stim. Every squad in the whole map can hear a stimmed octane running around.
            Octane can still be great for the team just depends on how you use his abilities

I like to use my boost to get in front of the team and use the bounce pad to jump up a cliff instead of having to climb it, or if someone is knocked due to storm I throw it in front of them so they get boosted towards safe zone, and if I’m feeling frisky (at the train) put the bounce pad on top of front car 👌🏼😩
        The meta just got thrown up in the air so nobody knows. But he's the legend I play, he's fun and has no real disadvantages, I say play him
            It’s funny because it a legend tier ranking, they basically said nothing wrong with fast-boi he just is a “worse version of pathfinder” mobility wise... now that all has changed so I can’t really think of a big negative to him
            Lets go!!!
        TLDR; No. But he could be (and soon™ will be) better.

His passive health regen still counteracts stim pretty well and will occasionally save you a syringe here and there. 

His stim speed boost is still nothing game changing. 

His jump pad has the potential to be really useful, especially with the new cooldown reduction (60 seconds). But you’ve got to realise what can and can’t be done with it (and have teammates that understand this too).

His head hitbox is hilariously bad (big) and hopefully got fixed this season - but the bugs have been so spicy I haven’t been able to test yet. 

Devs are planning more for him but it’s sadly looking like a few weeks/months still to go. 

I play him, wraith, and wattson an equal amount. He’s definitely the weakest of the three but I still had fun with him all throughout the last two seasons, even in ranked. 

You could come back in, pick him up, and still have fun.
        The thing is his kit doesn't do much

Sure he is decent but compare him to wraith,to pre-nerf pathfinder

Bangalore passive gives i think a bigger speed boost than octane (don't quote me on that) by just being shot at,not even hit
        Before the Pathfinder nerf he was a better octane than octane, a better revenant than revenant and a better loba than loba, but now loba, revenant and wraith are still better than octane at speed and they don't lose health.
            They don’t regen either js

Sure it’s slow, but can be better than using your only medkit/syringes
*In case you didn't know, you get here by winning.*
Yeah, looks like I'm switching back to Mirage :'(
Luis voice lmao
Wait you guys are getting heirlooms?
    Been playing since S1, just got my 1st Heirloom ever lol
        Been playing since launch day 😭
            Me too, all battle passes even, still 0 heirloom shards
            Been playing since launch day too. :( we can die together
    i switched to pc a little over two weeks ago and bought 60 packs today to try and get a loba skin and pulled the heirloom shards lol
    HAH. At least your character *has* an heirloom.
Blizzard would solve all their problems by removing hero switching and installing a draft but Nooooooooooooooo. They’ll do anything but that
    Overwatch doesn't have enough heroes for a draft. The same heroes would be banned every time
        yea, i sure wonder why those same heroes would be banned every single time
            For real though. This would fix a lot of problems. They left Brigitte OP for over 3 months before nerfing her, and she was still strong. Me and my friends dropped the game after Brigitte and just opening the game time to time makes me sick, it went downhill since the Moira launch. Hero ban would've at least made the game bearable.

It's even more annoying to know that this game won GOTY and had amazing potential. Now its just a mixed bag with shitty new heroes catered towards retarded gameplay like Wrecking Ball.
                Fuck overwatch, unless you enjoy playing with people who leave 2 minutes into ranked and basically losing points then I’d stay away. Game is a fucking joke, get these fucking genii and widow mains every day who suck ass lol. Thank fuck for not having a draft, people playing tank and support have to pick the slack up
                    PREACH. That game is so needlessly toxic for how stupid it can be on a regular basis.
        Yes but it’ll increase the quality of the games soo much and provide urgent balancing data.
    That’s a fucking horrible idea lmao.  With how many different hard counters there are in Overwatch, and how rock-paper-scissors the game is in terms of both 1-on-1 matchups and entire team comps, a draft system would literally be “oh boy I hope to god they don’t have an X character on their team”.  There would be no adaptability or fluidity to the game, and it would become extremely fucking boring.
> but if it stays like this I’ll learn to live with it

Same. Just going to have to use it more judiciously and make sure to pull off nice slingshots to cover ground quickly. Gone are the days of grappling up to places you could have easily just climbed.
    But now he sucks. That was the only reason to use Path. Movement. Don't learn to live with it... don't use him and bitch about it and they will fix it. If no one uses him due to being useless, they will fix it.
        That's what I'm hoping people will do, I'm sure not gonna use him now
            Especially since our new legend can fucking *teleport*
        I’ve only played since s4 and I was a solo path main until the Revenant buffs and I’ve tried him the past 2 weeks as well. I’m SO glad I got comfortable with someone else, I absolutely REFUSE 35 second cool down with no other improvements to go with. 

I told my homie I expect path usage to go down by a solid 75%. If I’m right I expect a buff. If people just learn to live with it, my grappling days are over.
        Yes, but we know how Respawn works, it will take at least 1 month for the next update.
            But at least show them we don't approve. At all. I was a Path main. Been using Rev for a little while cause his ult. I use Path from time to time when i want a really good game, but now... he's not even worth it. I could deal with 20sec maybe 25. But damn. Just wtf?
                Yes, a 20 second cooldown would be difficult to adapt, but a killing nerf like this one is too much to take, i *really* tried to make it work but no, he is useless now. I'm so angry right now, fuck Respawn and his shitty balancing.
            What I'm thinking is they purposely raised it to 35 knowing people would complain, then they lower it again and everyone will be fine with it because at least it's lower than 35
                this is so right..  dev's playing chess redditor's playing checkers
    This, i was playing with a friend and he was downed at the top of a small house , after the fight was over he was expecting me to climb with my grapple the small house, i said "hey man, i usually would have used my grapple to revive you, but with the 35 second cooldown could you please drop down?", i felt so ridiculous static.
Dont play path. If we don’t play path they will see we don’t like it then they will change it so more play him
[deleted]
    I mean based off what you just said it seems like they don't base all their decisions off what the community wants and instead bases them off something else, that something else probably being data like pick rate for legends, overall kdr for legends, how they perform in professional play etc.
especially if she had the same voice
    Who wants to bang on a zip line?
        Waiting for r34 pathy
    ONLY if he has the same voice
He finds all the maths questions
    But he still can't find his creator :(
        Bro, too soon.. we’re already dealing with this grapple nonsense
        oof
    short for mathew
2 + 2 is 4, minus 1 that's 3, quick hook!

*Mathfinder*
Imagine having an ult that's ultimately less usefull than an ability
Wraith mains: First time?
what's the cooldown on other mobility legends?

Wraith's and Loba's Q abilities

I mean if I can teleport faster than Pathfinder can hook... there is a balancing issue
>Traversing

Was the only reason I played this game, felt so freeing, especially for a disabled person. 

Why not buff other champs (oh wait they did).

Or make an item on the map that has a single use grappling hook for EVERYONE and let pathfinder keep his 15 sec cd.

I uninstalled origin and apex.
A lot of path mains tap and release the grapple to leap high into the air, so that would end up breaking the game even more for them (35/4 < 15)
there is balancing and then there is murder... If I were to do a Tier list of all Legends I would probably not even put him in

Others: hey you forgot Pathfinder in your list

Me: No, I didn't forget him.
    [deleted]
        I assume Gibby is still complete bullshit to fight. I dropped the game because I'm sick of BRs and I don't think these questionable balance decisions make me want to return.
Lol loba and mirage probably this season
    Saaame. Mirage is SO good now and I’ve been wanting to main him for awhile but he was never the best.. and Loba’s teleport.. so fun.
[deleted]
    Hella facts
    Girl thicker than a bowl of oatmeal
Im actually fine with that nerf. U got a gold armor? Toss the bat and the med kit and keep the small ones. And now people are gonna use the evo more
Well, Gibby and everyone inside his dome do too, but passively yeah, only Lifeline. She could use a more direct buff though, in my opinion.
I mean that was already the case. If you miss a grapple on even a 10 second cooldown that's still a big window to get dove. The difference between 15 seconds and 35 seconds isn't the difference between dying or not, it just prevents you from using the character for scouting and makes it less fun to play in pubs/ranked, and means you have fewer opportunities to push people.

Basically grapple is reserved as an oh-shit button now.

Good path mains are ditching the character now. Best Pathfinder players in the world are about to be maining Gibby or Caustic now
    Yeah I will no longer main path. His only attribute to truly help the team is gone. They totally fucked this up imo. A 20-25 MAX second cool down would’ve been fine, but most fights only last a minute. So for us path mains who knew how to jump in, hit damage on all of the enemy team, jump back out to heal so your boys can either take them out the rest of the way or at least hold them so you can get back in, days are over. He’s honestly kind of a pointless legend now... which hurts to say about my zippy boi :’( Looks like the move is to bloodhound or Loba. Guess I’ll find out... RIP my brother path mains...
    So basically in line with wraith and octane instead of a complete tier above.

>	Basically grapple is reserved as an oh-shit button now.
    I have 45,000 kills on Pathfinder and I’m like actually in shock they would more than double his grapple time. I feel way to invested to switch mains so I just need to adapt to using the grapple less frequently.
This is what I’m saying... the least they could have done is taken low profile off. Or like give us 10-20 dmg for grappling an enemy, take away gas damage... SOMETHING
    Make it so grappled enemies cant shoot you or you can shoot them :p
maybe it was to drive hardcore pathfinder mains back to titanfall 2 where we all ... ahem ... they all belong!
With low profile. He is now the worst legend in the game lmao fml
His ult needs a buff though... half the time it wont lemme shoot the zip or it wont go where it says its sposed to
    His ult should def just stick to anything not tagged OOB imo.
Yeah dude. Looking at it from this point of view just shows how messed up this shit is
Exactly. They also cut Octane's jump pad cool down by 30 seconds.
When you come from TF|2 it is. I could never use path without thinking about how bad he feels compared to a grapple pilot.
    When I first started, I was less concerned with the cooldown and more with the range.
    I mean every legend is weak as hell compared to a pilot. Bloodhound tactical versus the darts? Octane stim versus the stim? It makes sense with the balance of the game even if it is sad. When everyone can't have grapple it's not really fair to have a super fast grapple on just one character.
Gibby literally devoured all of lifelines abilities for himself.
The only reason I was playing Pathfinder was because of how fun he was to zip around the map, but now I don't dare do that, you never know when the next fight starts and you gotta wait 35 seconds to get in/out
    That is the problem, but I don't wanna get bashed anymore about "oh, he's just complaining" when it's like, Pathfinders thing to be swingy boi. It's a fast paced legend for a fast paced game. it's what sets him APART from all the other legends.
It's a safety valve now, not a means of consistent transport.    Not a fan.
    Same dude, same.
I think they just put it on par with Loba and Wraith's Tactical mobility skill

basically what they have done to pathfinder is to change the utility of the ability. they want the ability to be used as a tactical maneuver (do it once, make it count) and not as a mobility tool.  

the real mobility god is Octane.
i'm thinking that they wanted to change the role completely of pathfinder.

From the Legends, the mobility god should be Octane. not pathfinder. 

they wanted to change his hook from being a mobility tool, to be a tactical skill. (use it once, make it count)
    well octane certainly is the mobility god now. Except they killed the rabbit to make way for the turtle...
You act like path only goes 25m

A good arc can send you way further than that
    Teleporting 75 meters away in a second is safer than a good arc. You can shoot a path while it is arcing.
        you can shoot loba while she's aiming her bracelet and waiting for it to land too, if you want to argue semantics here
        And you can shoot Loba while she's throwing her wrist and landing
Lmao you can go a lot farther than 25M with the grapple.

Also the grapple has maneuverability which allows you to do some pretty crazy plays.


I agree they went a little heavy handed with the grapple, I'd be fine with the CD if they gave the grapple 2 charges with the 35 second CD or lowered it to 25-27 seconds.
    Charges would be so nice.
Though it's probably to early to tell, on the surface grapple seems way better. Loba's tp has to reach its destination first before she moves. Pathy starts flying 0.3 seconds after pressing Q.
    And she's very slow as it's flying
he still got one though, youre saying after 8 months as if it completely invalidates his rework
The difference is that Pathfinder's abilities fit the meta of quick and strategic positioning. Good positioning and fast movement is something that counteracted most abilities. Even if the lower tier legends were buffed, Pathfinder would still be a must have.
Its not even that you have to just think tactically you had to do that anyway now you just don't get to use it when you want lol.
Honestly it's like should I use it now? But what if I need it again...and yeah the fun of slingshotting urself along can't be beat
    Exactly i used to grapple going in fights, escaping fights, going up somewhere, dropping from a high place to cancel that pause when u hut the ground, grapple the ground and launch myself just for fun, now it's for escaping fights only :(
        They've ruined one of the most fun to play video game characters ever made :(
Thats the thing. Lobas tactical isnt really an effective escape method, its better for flanking or fast travel. 

Paths grapple is good for all of those things plus pretty much any other situation in the game.
I feel like limiting mobility for a lo pro legend is never a good idea. Thats why ppl not using lifeline anymore, need to be able to move if ur a lo pro
That’s a very fair pov. Path has awesome voice lines and character model. Feels bad to have a legend that lost their identity. (I was hoping for 20 sec but 35 is craaaaaxy)
Don’t tell me
Still 10% of 10M+ playerbase is a lot of revenue.
    1 million people are not going to pay real money for Loba... come on.
Wraith still had a borked hotbox in her favor, and a top tier passive and ulti. PFs ult is good, but janky to use and doesn't make you invulnerable, and down people can't use it like Wraiths. And his passive isn't even a passive. 

So pathfinder has:

Tallest/largest hitbox out of the low profile legends, an ultimate that is OK at best, a useless passive, and a now gutted tactical. 

The worst thing about this nerf is grapple was one of, if not THE most fun ability to use in the game. Phasing as Wraith isn't fun, it's just utility, but going fast as pathfinder and repositioning like spiderman was a huge source of FUN in this game. Now you just get to have less fun playing as pathfinder.

This isn't even like "it's fun to abuse grapple to win fights", more like it was just a fun ability to use. Now it will just... Not be fun.
    Remember when Gold Helmet gave you a grapple every 7 seconds?  ; u ;
Definitely not a path main. But I love the bot. He's definitely the reason I first fell in love with the movement in this game. 

The point is not that he needed a nerf. The point is that this is a significantly less fun change to the gameplay. Much like the wraith nerf was.

Whenever possible they should be buffing weak legends not nerfing strong legends.
    Same, I'm more annoyed the most fun character is now much less fun.
I fkn, hate that. Happens at least once every 3 games.
    Grapple breaks at >90 degrees, don't turn so wide
        Yeah if you turn your FOV above 90, you will be able to break the grapple while still seeing it, is why it feels like a bug.
We better get inside, we are going to catch a cold
    Hey another me!
        Soon to be me too...
            That hurt my soul
                F for all the dedicated Path mains amigo
                    F......lets just hope they dont turn into TTV wraiths
        Shhhhh *whispers* you're ruining the reference!
You're a jerk.  You made me think Tom Petty had died and somehow I missed it.
    Umm, he's been dead for a few years now
        ...

and now I'm sad : (
            Yeah sorry I had to be the one to tell you
I don't know, but Elicia had a very good point, how do they expect Hughes to do his very important job if they bury him? That's a real oversight by the Amestris State Military.

    Octane’s not actually bad, especially if you’re going to be playing on your own for a little while.

        Octane is a ton of fun, but fuck me he's loud when using his stim. Every squad in the whole map can hear a stimmed octane running around.
        Octane can still be great for the team just depends on how you use his abilities

I like to use my boost to get in front of the team and use the bounce pad to jump up a cliff instead of having to climb it, or if someone is knocked due to storm I throw it in front of them so they get boosted towards safe zone, and if I’m feeling frisky (at the train) put the bounce pad on top of front car 👌🏼😩

So for us path mains who knew how to jump in, hit damage on all of the enemy team, jump back out to heal so your boys can either take them out the rest of the way or at least hold them so you can get back in, days are over. He’s honestly kind of a pointless legend now... which hurts to say about my zippy boi :’( Looks like the move is to bloodhound or Loba. Guess I’ll find out... RIP my brother path mains...
So basically in line with wraith and octane instead of a complete tier above.

>	Basically grapple is reserved as an oh-shit button now.
I have 45,000 kills on Pathfinder and I’m like actually in shock they would more than double his grapple time. I feel way to invested to switch mains so I just need to adapt to using the grapple less frequently.
Make it so grappled enemies cant shoot you or you can shoot them :p
His ult should def just stick to anything not tagged OOB imo.
When I first started, I was less concerned with the cooldown and more with the range.
I mean every legend is weak as hell compared to a pilot. Bloodhound tactical versus the darts? Octane stim versus the stim? It makes sense with the balance of the game even if it is sad. When everyone can't have grapple it's not really fair to have a super fast grapple on just one character.
That is the problem, but I don't wanna get bashed anymore about "oh, he's just complaining" when it's like, Pathfinders thing to be swingy boi. It's a fast paced legend for a fast paced game. it's what sets him APART from all the other legends.
Same dude, same.
well octane certainly is the mobility god now. Except they killed the rabbit to make way for the turtle...
Teleporting 75 meters away in a second is safer than a good arc. You can shoot a path while it is arcing.
    you can shoot loba while she's aiming her bracelet and waiting for it to land too, if you want to argue semantics here
    And you can shoot Loba while she's throwing her wrist and landing
Charges would be so nice.
And she's very slow as it's flying
Exactly i used to grapple going in fights, escaping fights, going up somewhere, dropping from a high place to cancel that pause when u hut the ground, grapple the ground and launch myself just for fun, now it's for escaping fights only :(
    They've ruined one of the most fun to play video game characters ever made :(
1 million people are not going to pay real money for Loba... come on.
Remember when Gold Helmet gave you a grapple every 7 seconds?  ; u ;
Same, I'm more annoyed the most fun character is now much less fun.
Grapple breaks at >90 degrees, don't turn so wide
    Yeah if you turn your FOV above 90, you will be able to break the grapple while still seeing it, is why it feels like a bug.
Hey another me!
    Soon to be me too...
        That hurt my soul
            F for all the dedicated Path mains amigo
                F......lets just hope they dont turn into TTV wraiths
    Shhhhh *whispers* you're ruining the reference!
Umm, he's been dead for a few years now
    ...

and now I'm sad : (
        Yeah sorry I had to be the one to tell you
he had so much work to do. Thatd the part that hurts. His daughter not understanding. Then the second punch from Mustang as a stoic type character breaks down.
Quick stop in 2018
Yeah, that's the big dif between the two for me - Hughes' death has so much more impact in the original because you have the time to actually get to know and like him and see him through the other characters' eyes. In Brotherhood his death is a shock and a galvanizing force for the others, but you don't get the same sense of tragedy and loss of a good man in a world that needs more of them.
    Exactly. I understand why Hughes had to go, though. His big brain was simply too OP. He already had everything figured out before it began.
Octane’s not actually bad, especially if you’re going to be playing on your own for a little while.  He’s just not great in terms of team interaction, most of the other characters bring something to the table for their teammates in one form or another, but Octane’s jumppad is somewhat limited and specific.  Although it’s more appealing now since the cool down was shortened and pathfinder will probably be less used.
    Octane is a ton of fun, but fuck me he's loud when using his stim. Every squad in the whole map can hear a stimmed octane running around.
    Octane can still be great for the team just depends on how you use his abilities

I like to use my boost to get in front of the team and use the bounce pad to jump up a cliff instead of having to climb it, or if someone is knocked due to storm I throw it in front of them so they get boosted towards safe zone, and if I’m feeling frisky (at the train) put the bounce pad on top of front car 👌🏼😩
The meta just got thrown up in the air so nobody knows. But he's the legend I play, he's fun and has no real disadvantages, I say play him
    It’s funny because it a legend tier ranking, they basically said nothing wrong with fast-boi he just is a “worse version of pathfinder” mobility wise... now that all has changed so I can’t really think of a big negative to him
    Lets go!!!
TLDR; No. But he could be (and soon™ will be) better.

His passive health regen still counteracts stim pretty well and will occasionally save you a syringe here and there. 

His stim speed boost is still nothing game changing. 

His jump pad has the potential to be really useful, especially with the new cooldown reduction (60 seconds). But you’ve got to realise what can and can’t be done with it (and have teammates that understand this too).

His head hitbox is hilariously bad (big) and hopefully got fixed this season - but the bugs have been so spicy I haven’t been able to test yet. 

Devs are planning more for him but it’s sadly looking like a few weeks/months still to go. 

I play him, wraith, and wattson an equal amount. He’s definitely the weakest of the three but I still had fun with him all throughout the last two seasons, even in ranked. 

You could come back in, pick him up, and still have fun.
The thing is his kit doesn't do much

Sure he is decent but compare him to wraith,to pre-nerf pathfinder

Bangalore passive gives i think a bigger speed boost than octane (don't quote me on that) by just being shot at,not even hit
Before the Pathfinder nerf he was a better octane than octane, a better revenant than revenant and a better loba than loba, but now loba, revenant and wraith are still better than octane at speed and they don't lose health.
    They don’t regen either js

Sure it’s slow, but can be better than using your only medkit/syringes
Been playing since launch day 😭
    Me too, all battle passes even, still 0 heirloom shards
    Been playing since launch day too. :( we can die together
yea, i sure wonder why those same heroes would be banned every single time
    For real though. This would fix a lot of problems. They left Brigitte OP for over 3 months before nerfing her, and she was still strong. Me and my friends dropped the game after Brigitte and just opening the game time to time makes me sick, it went downhill since the Moira launch. Hero ban would've at least made the game bearable.

It's even more annoying to know that this game won GOTY and had amazing potential. Now its just a mixed bag with shitty new heroes catered towards retarded gameplay like Wrecking Ball.
        Fuck overwatch, unless you enjoy playing with people who leave 2 minutes into ranked and basically losing points then I’d stay away. Game is a fucking joke, get these fucking genii and widow mains every day who suck ass lol. Thank fuck for not having a draft, people playing tank and support have to pick the slack up
            PREACH. That game is so needlessly toxic for how stupid it can be on a regular basis.
Yes but it’ll increase the quality of the games soo much and provide urgent balancing data.
That's what I'm hoping people will do, I'm sure not gonna use him now
    Especially since our new legend can fucking *teleport*
I’ve only played since s4 and I was a solo path main until the Revenant buffs and I’ve tried him the past 2 weeks as well. I’m SO glad I got comfortable with someone else, I absolutely REFUSE 35 second cool down with no other improvements to go with. 

I told my homie I expect path usage to go down by a solid 75%. If I’m right I expect a buff. If people just learn to live with it, my grappling days are over.
Yes, but we know how Respawn works, it will take at least 1 month for the next update.
    But at least show them we don't approve. At all. I was a Path main. Been using Rev for a little while cause his ult. I use Path from time to time when i want a really good game, but now... he's not even worth it. I could deal with 20sec maybe 25. But damn. Just wtf?
        Yes, a 20 second cooldown would be difficult to adapt, but a killing nerf like this one is too much to take, i *really* tried to make it work but no, he is useless now. I'm so angry right now, fuck Respawn and his shitty balancing.
    What I'm thinking is they purposely raised it to 35 knowing people would complain, then they lower it again and everyone will be fine with it because at least it's lower than 35
        this is so right..  dev's playing chess redditor's playing checkers
Waiting for r34 pathy
Bro, too soon.. we’re already dealing with this grapple nonsense
oof
I assume Gibby is still complete bullshit to fight. I dropped the game because I'm sick of BRs and I don't think these questionable balance decisions make me want to return.
you can shoot loba while she's aiming her bracelet and waiting for it to land too, if you want to argue semantics here
And you can shoot Loba while she's throwing her wrist and landing
