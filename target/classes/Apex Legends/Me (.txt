‚ÄòSorry mate, we‚Äôre already playing‚Äô
    *you sit silently in discord and hear someone is leaving*

‚ÄúHey are you guys still playing?‚Äù

1st guy: ‚ÄúUuh nah imma get off‚Äù

2nd guy: ‚ÄúSame I *might as well get off too*‚Äù

Its that ‚Äúmight as well get off too‚Äù that hits ya in the feels. Oh, if you‚Äôre not with him then you won‚Äôt play w me?

Halp me

Edit: wow! thanks silver kind, for the stranger!

        My friends call this the ditchboi chain. Once someone leaves, even if there was someone waiting to take their place, people start trickling out.
            the ditchboi theorem

honestly you could do some research and prove this correct
            To be honest, after playing a 2 hour sweat session and someone calls they are getting off, you suddenly lose motivation too and just call it a night. 

You definitely don‚Äôt want to have to party up with the bot of a friend just to get repeatedly smoked.  
                [removed]
                    Oh god relatable.  
Edit : I just realised I commented on a 4 months old post
                        Don‚Äôt worry it doesn‚Äôt matter how old the post is
                Was almost planning on writing something similar, couldn‚Äôt be any more true.
        Relatable.
            I've been on both sides.

You don't even realise until it's too late. Thankfully now we usually just split into two groups or play another game if it ever happens. 
                Wow I wish my friends had the social competency to understand that.

They always mean well, they truly do. But they're so oblivious sometimes, it's painful.

I'm always down for playing whatever can include everyone online but some of my friends..eh...can't say the same.


                    Are you also the worst player in your group? 
                        Definitely not; we play a wide variety of games and there are certainly some I'm the best at, and some I'm the worst at. 
        I've been that 2nd guy before, and it definitely doesn't have to do with you personally. 

When playing a game with someone for awhile, you associate said game with that person. So not playing with them just feels *off*, yknow? Cos your experience with that game is in no small part defined by a person's presence, so the vibe completely changes when they're gone.

Also, if they really wanted nothing to do with you, they'd have played using their personal discord voice chat. 
            i do this so much and for me when one of my friends gets off it‚Äôs more of a reminder that i‚Äôve probably been playing too long and should get off before it‚Äôs too late

edit: i also just don‚Äôt like playing with some people
                Yeah, I no life pretty hard when it comes to gaming so when someone leaves it's a reminder for me to maybe do something else. Or idk, probably just get up for a good stretch and a snack before hopping back on.
                Lmao, yeah I agree with this guy it's not what you're thinking there are other reasons that happens.  


edit: sometimes it's exactly what you're afraid of that happens.
                I‚Äôve been the 2nd and the 1st guy to leave. One of my friends usually gets off right after I do. It‚Äôs just we play games for hours straight and our energy is just drained from it. 
            Yeah one of my best buds definitely the one I played games with just joined the army not too long ago. Games in general feel a little off because we played everything like every weekend and the rest of my buddies aren't as into it as we were.
            Theres also the whole situation where playing with just one other person seems a bit weird. I feel like I need to play with 3 people or more in any kind of multiplayer game. Same goes with group settings. I can never be with just one other friend.
        If it makes you feel any better, when I do this it‚Äôs usually midnight or later in my time zone and I am guiltily making the responsible choice to go to bed. I was going to keep the good times rolling if the squad was going to stay together, but once the squad breaks up in my mind the good times are over. All or nothing. 
            This is me. I'm very willing to stay up late *if we've got momentum*, but I work full time and when someone leaves and it's 12am it's time for me to bow out. Setting up in a new squad just feels irresponsible at that point. Plus my SO would not be happy if I didn't come to bed until 3am lol
        Well it does suck but I can end up on the outs sometimes and one thing i've done to curb that is by being better than them to the point where they all want me on the team to help carry. 

I've even had the most ironic thing happen where I was so much better than them that it became frustrating and made some new friends going in solo and kicking ass. 

If you're a good teammate you'll find it easier to make friends. Don't be afraid to ask the party if they'd like to join up. Winning a game or getting close to it will go a long way. 

        Bro I'll be your new buddy if you want
        I am sorry to everyone I‚Äôve done this two. I am ignorant teenager and I never realized how the other person feels when I say that
        Lol now I feel bad cuz I did that today.
        I feel your pain, anon. 
            This isn't 4chan
        It happens to the best of us, the worst of us just get ignored. At least we get a reply.
        I'm always those guys when it's a friend of a friend trying to join in.
        I tend to get left out cuz I'm the poorest and farthest living of all my friends. Apex being free was my lifesaver, as are most free things. When it's 10pm and my friends are saying that wanna get off I just beg for one more game so I can suck as much love out as I can before I'm alone again. Well I have a SO but she feeds off of the emotions I am trying to generate. 
        Eh I've done this before and I hope that's not what my friends think.

It's really just that I lose track of time playing/bantering with friends. So when someone decides to leave it kind of snaps me back and I'm thinking "oh damn I've been playing for awhile, I should do something else/sleep now".
    my mate: "We are all already partied up together but i'll join you and we can duo and the other two can duo"
        Exactly what me and my mates do. 
    Worse: you're playing, but another friend gets on and the replace you
        Now that's just messed up bro....
        Get a load of this guy bragging about having 4 friends
        r/2meirl4meirl
        I'd expect if from rando discord members. But friends? You've gotta find new ones
        I cant do that to my pals, like i always tell them ‚Äúi dont like it done to me so why would i do it to you‚Äù üòë
        Has it actually happened to you?
        Oof you might need new friends my guy
    ive sent that message a couple of times since apex came out and damn it hurts to say it to them....
They should create a discord channel for all the 4th player so everyone has someone to play with 
    Until you're perpetually the fourth friend of every fourth friend group
        If you‚Äôre 4*n* then you‚Äôre 4ever alone
            (Providing n is indivisible by 3)
                It's not.  But it is indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
                    This was so funny to me. 
                Unless n is a multiple of 3 all numbers are indivisible by 3
                    Unless it‚Äôs an odd number, it‚Äôs an even number

Source: math
                        And this! This! Is why we're the fourth friend.
                        This is brand new information..
            You are never alone ;)

r/apexlegendslfg
                LFG subs are always awful and unreliable. Just use the LFG channel in the discord. 
                    I think the entire point of that sub is to show the existence of the discord
                    Yes, furthermore if your as sweaty as I am be sure to search for other requirements aside from level. You'll see a LOT of people searching for level 20+, 30+, 40+ etc and in my experience level has absolutely no bearing on skill. I prefer to search for CS:GO rank thresholds like DMG+ and have had better success at landing good players. 
        I wonder if you get paired up with the seventh son of a seventh son and take over the world
        5th man group inc
        That's like 16 friends though, so that counte for something
    Same discord channel for all those missing socks as well.
    That's basically what we did because we have so many people playing Apex in ours, we created two channels to avoid game cross talk. 
    There is a discord for Apex lol. Its pretty sweet
Meanwhile I can't get a single one of these idiots to even try it.
    I finally got 2 buddies and now 1 is avoiding the game. I fear he will return to fortnite...
        Do people really play only one game? I play 3 consistently, 2 before this. One just gets old.

&#x200B;

edit: i guess so haha
            generally in pvp games people play only that game to be good at it, I don't understand why casual gaming is disappearing in favour of competetive, but alas. I'm playing like 4 games atm
                Me too, atm I'm playing fifa, RL, cod BO4 and Apex. I dont get why people have this mindset where they have to be gods at a game so they're only allowed to play 1
                    Winning is more fun than losing. Also higher level play feels good, likely because you know you‚Äôre winning because you‚Äôre good, and not because you‚Äôre lucky.
                        exactly this.  when I get started playing a game I make it a point to file all the mechanics away in my brain so that I can constantly reference them when playing.  this entails mastering those mechanics first in order to effectively use them in game play consistently and the intensity with which I plat games doesnt really allow for the mastering of multiple games with different mechanical systems.  for instance, I got crazy good at fortnite up until I just stopped playing it, now I'm currently grinding RL and having a blast because im still just getting started and finally getting a hang of things mechanically so now the flood gates have opened and my gameplay can really flourish.  however if I wasnt focusing RL so much then I would probably be average at best with fairly slow progression.  what it comes down to is the high level play, it's awful when you're losing because you dont execute, it's even worse to not know what to do and losing.  things get really competetive when everyone is high skill and thats what makes it interesting to me.  that unfortunately also makes it very hard to keep up w multiple games because I know  im handicapping myself in one or the other by playing both concurrently.

                            Yeah I think casual gamers fail to understand the mental battles going on behind high level play in competitive games. The Japanese word to describe the concept is ‚ÄúYomi‚Äù: knowing the mind of your opponent. The best competitive players are often thinking several steps ahead for themselves AND their opponent. 

This will most often happen after one has gained two things: intimate knowledge of all the game mechanics and muscle memory so strong that your character is an extension of yourself. This requires a lot of time and practice to achieve. However, when you are participating in layers of yomi and you come out on top, it is the greatest feeling in the world.

And muscle memory is a big reason to stick with one game. My main FPS has been R6S for a few years. I have been playing Apex a ton since release and I still can‚Äôt stop trying to lean with Q+E. It causes me to lose quite often. This is also why people will main a single character. Once those abilities become second nature, you can start to think more about what your enemies will do and less about which buttons to press to pull off your combo.
                COD for MP. 

Apex for BR. 

Tekken for Fighting. 

And whatever SP is the flavour of the month. Right now KH3. 

When you play too many from the same genre it get‚Äôs a bit much for me. 
                I noticed this last night on PC. The amount of people with something related to Twitch or YouTube in their username is amazing. "ttv_" or "_yt" every game. 

People just trying to make it big by streaming, gotta get good gameplay clips. Cant have good gameplay if you don't play, etc
                Because you can't just casually play a game anymore without being wrecked by the competitive players. It's no fun losing every fight. 
                People like to win, who knew.
                It's not really about casual/competitive though. Some people just have the mindset of "I'll only play this game until I die, even if I have a 0.2 KDR." Like they are brainwashed or something.

It's sad. Play more games peoples. There's a lot of good ones out there, even if you only play free games.
            Yesterday I played Apex, fortnite, battlefield v, and rdr2. Mind you two of those I played long enough to grab a daily, and most days I play 1 or two, but the rotation is 5 or 6 deep right now. Depends on who is on and what sounds fun. I'm not gonna get gud, so might as well have fun.
            i play different genres of games but no typically im sticking to 1 battle royale or 1 mmo
            >Do people really play only one game

Good (the best) players stick to one game at a time
        Ew
            ooga booga fortnite bad
            Kinda rude but ok 
    Relateable, i know they will like it but they refuse to give it a try
        I kept showing them twitch viewers compared to fort and the 10 then 25 million player mile stone.. then they gave it a shot. It‚Äôs free!
            One of my friends refused to get it because he just didn‚Äôt feel like it and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúbitch it‚Äôs FREE‚Äù finally after me playing it for a while he‚Äôs like ‚Äúok I‚Äôll try it‚Äù now we both play a lot.
    I got like 7 pals and all are still into league/fortnite     
     
Had to drop the game since the solo experience is that bad for me, sadly
        Hey bro if you would like someone to play apex with drop me an add (I‚Äôm assuming PC) -MattackSC

I‚Äôm always looking for more people to play with since I can‚Äôt often play when my normal group is on.
    Hahaha, my buddy tried it for 2 matches, rage quited and uninstalled it
    Same. 
    I got one. so now we are trying to get one more from our friendgroup but they are not hearing it. seems like they like playing the same games day after day... (dota 2 RB6S)
    I convinced 2 friends to play it and they had fun, but for one friend the game had disconnects all the time and my other friend crashed every hour. So they kinda lost interest. :/
My friend/4th of over 6 years drifted away silently never to be seen again thx apex 
    We had to put ours down... very sad and a hard choice but it was best for all of us
        did he go quietly?
            Nope... each slam of the car door on his head was just as hard as the last. He is at peace now.
                It‚Äôs not often that I audibly laugh at things on the internet but you got me
                I will guess it took about 15 slams, give or take 20. You did gods work.
                    I was pretty hungry and that always throws my estimates off for some reason, your guess is as good as mine
                When I was a boy...
                LOL
                You got me bro I‚Äôm dying
                Fisk?
    I know the feel. One member of my group just stopped replying and would give crap excuses.

Been gone for 3 years.

Another one got in a relationship that ended poorly. One of his friends says he's drinking himself to death and the other says he's doing fine. Yup. I'm just as confused.

Gone for 2 years.


Sucks when you go from talking to someone all day for years. To maybe talk once a week or month.

                Yeah sounds like they were dickheads. 
            Sounds like he was considering it for a while and that was the last straw for him or he was crazy one or the other
            Lmao that sounds like y‚Äôall did a lot more than that. 
        I know that feel man <3. Don't make my mistake and delude yourself into thinking you don't need more friends... please acknowledge that they have moved on and now you need to as well. It hurts so much, but it hurts way more when you've been deluding yourself for years.
        One of my best friends from college lives 15 mins away and works in the same office building as me. He started dating a girl about 8 months ago and now he never hangs out, IRL or in Discord. Last night he texts me about trying Apex because his girlfriend is busy so he "has a night free." 

Dude never even got online.
            That is pretty normal behavior from my experience. Every male friend I have ever had has done this. They get a girlfriend and then disappear for a stretch of time, eventually they find their way back. I even did it to them when I met my wife. Its amazing we have any friends at all. [Ladies... cloud the mind.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqFL_JvG2-g)
    It's only been one week lol 
        Sounds like it‚Äôs a bigger issue than the game then lol
            Somebody should do a welfare check. Just to see if he's doin alright.  Maybe invite him to go get a pokebowl or something. 
        A week is all it takes brother üòû

                            If your friends can‚Äôt handle not being invited to a 3 player game that‚Äôs full and all the boys wanna play it, fourth friend included, they‚Äôre either being too selfish or are immature. Legit nothing to be upset about. 
                                That's not his point, respect works both ways.

Happily blasting a 3-man squad game all evening long despite being online with 4 is selfish and immature to be honest.

We switch games when a 4th comes online because we want to include our friends, not exclude them, despite them being okay with being sidelined.
                            But I wanna play Apex
                does anyone dare say it?
                Same, I'd recommend endless dungeon it's only ¬£3.00
        Yeah, we had this problem solved ages ago during the days of couch co-op. The only difference now is that you might not be able to watch your friends duke it out when you're on the sidelines
            You can on console. We shareplay our match to the 4th one. That way he's in on the action and can even provide tactical advice on comms!
                Shareplay? This has to be a PS4 thing right?
                    You guys could broadcast on Xbox or stream another way with all 3 streaming and the 4th watches all views.
                    You can all co-stream on mixer on xbox. It will show all perspectives on one persons channel. 
                    yup
    How does the most sensible answer only have 5 upvotes right now?

Are ya'll just dicks to your friends?!
        Yeah basically.
            Lol fuck my friends.
                I wouldn‚Äôt expect anything less from my friends either.  I need new friends. Bad. I played the game where I don‚Äôt call them to initiate first for a couple months and have gotten maybe a few texts and no invites. Either they all are hermits now or just don‚Äôt include me anymore.  Sucks getting old.

                    I know that feel bro
            i relate. reserved a spot when my boyfriend was playing with his brother, said that i will come on after i eat. i eat, check discord and they are playing as a 3 squad now. i tell my boyfriend to let me know when one of them leaves. im not one to take others spots and im always the one to give my spot away if someone wants to come on, but like, this time i reserved a spot and wanted to play. hours go by, i ask my boyfriend if i will have a spot soon ''i think soon yeah'' hours go by again.. i dont get on any other game bc patiently waiting for one of them to leave any minute now. it gets late and i havent played a single game. safe to say i was pretty sad and disappointed, had a talk with the bf and he said that in the future he would just go duos with me if that happened again. oh well, life of the 4th one and the one who is always willing to give out their spot so ppl use the fact against you that ''you wont mind'' :)
        >Are ya'll just dicks to your friends?!

yes
        Because it was only a few minutes old when you saw it?
    With my friends it's first come first server. They're often willing to split into 2's, but playing with 1 other random when you're 2 just isn't very fun. I'd usually rather solo than make 3 other people play with a random. 

However, if there were duo's, that would be great. I wouldn't even care about singles.
        Tbh my best rounds were with 2 randoms, its just alot of fun for me no matter how I play.
            Having fun with 2 non-salty randos is my favorite.
                occasionally you will get a random who shocks you, like, "jesus, this guy is *good*"
                Yeah, the community so far seems really nice, too.
There was never any salt and Ive played hundrets of games already.
                    Ive been really impressed by the friendliness and teamwork ive seen so far too. Except in my last game this dude started mocking me me for saying hello and then he passed me jumpmaster but then and his buddy decided to drop on the total opposite direction to me after i jumped. Then he got knocked and i was all "gee, if only i was nearby to help you out" and he fucking lost it, screamed at me, said he wasnt mad, deliberately burned himself to death with his own thermite grenade and then disconnected.

It was the funniest thing ive seen in this game so far
                    It‚Äôs still early in the games life but the way the mechanics incentive teamwork is a complete fresh of breath air. 
            Same here. I've won 6 or 7 with mu homies but with randoms I've won at least 10-15 matches. First game in a long time where randoms aren't a bane & actually help. 
                The game is good at forcing co-op/team play. Solo runs usually get you destroyed pretty quick. It's a nice change from squad games where randoms just wander off into the sunset to die.. 
            Same. I‚Äôve only won three times but they‚Äôve all been with randoms haha 

My brother in law and I have played together a few nights but we only made it to #2, because usually the random dies before the final battle and we get rushed by a full squad, and I‚Äôm still learning FPS games üòî
    [deleted]
        Not all heroes wear capes 
    My friends are not that caring lol
    Real friends. Everyone else prolly talks mad shit behind their 4th friends back. 
    Same here. We split, me and my bud got a ez dub and the other two scrubs dropped three times during it. 

I still wish we could four man though honestly. 
    Now you have a 3rd and 4th friend being bitter about being stuck with each other instead of playing with you.
We have a slightly different problem. My husband and I play together and finding a friend of ours who‚Äôs solo to join us rarely happens. 
    Adopt a 4th to be your 3rd? üëã

                Cool the downvotes boys that was funny haha
                    I'm torn, I wanna downvoted but that was funny.

    Yeah, I hear unicorns can be hard to find
    That's how it's going for me too, waiting on duos.
    Try and message asking for a 3some
    I refused to upvote this comment cuz the number is just glorious 
    If you are on pc and still want a 3rd, send me a message. I've got a few groups i bounce around to as the third so im used to hopping in a new duo.
    dm me if you want a Gibraltar watching your back :) 
[deleted]
    Same, I introduced my friend and now he plays 24/7 and never invites me even if hes playing solo. I asked him if he likes the game and he goes "It's okay, not that great though",  meanwhile it's the only thing he's been playing since I showed it to him like a week ago. 
        Seems like he's lying? He just doesn't want to play with you man. Better off without him.
            Well, could also be that they have nothing better to do and just want to escape into the game and not really talk to anyone or think about anything. Depends on whether or not there are any signs that they're a bit down.
                Ive been there, sometimes its nice to just play games by yourself :) 
                Yeah sometimes I wanna play like Dizzy and just go full aggro to get better and its better to do that in soloQ cause I noticed my friends want to play more slow-paced
            Better completely ghost a friend because he wants to play a game by himself.
        sometimes people just like to play alone 
        Some people have different goals, even for things most people would consider recreational. Don‚Äôt take it personally. 
        Now you know he is not your real friend. I had to learn this the hard way. you‚Äôre better off without him.
            Just because they don't want to play a videogame with someone doesn't mean they aren't a real friend
    Hmu if you want to play :)
        Your words say one thing, your username however...
    Yeah I introduced some friends to each other over PUBG now I don't exist.
    What a n00b! Kidding, it's totally okay to not have any wins. Shit gets hard when you're against what, 57 other people? It's complicated, so all I got to say is that positioning/movement is more key than gunplay. You starting to die? Drink some run the fuck away juice and get your ass in gear, as it's better to run and live than die and have to be collected. Learn to slidejump, and remember that you can do a super-clamper by holding jump as you run at a vertical surface. People mistakenly kinda stand there and trade shots at a distance, but being able to climb a building or slide closer through cover is definitely a skill. Keep working and get better coordinated with friends and you'll get a win! I believe in you!
        Also it's worth pointing out that I honestly get a lot more enjoyment out of socializing with my friends and fucking around when I play BRs. We're somewhat trying most of the time, sometimes we get super sweaty, but it's all just fun. We'll usually have a couple of games where we just loot and chat about shit and then die to the first ppl we see. Then someone will say "alright guys focus the chi this time" and we'll pick a long drop early and place top 3.

Basically all I'm tryna say is that in my experience you don't have to be always going for wins to enjoy yourself. we all play video games to have fun, so do what you think is fun! 
Our 4th wasn't there on the day the game came out and now he doesn't want to play because it's 'our game'. 
    Sounds like your 4th is wanting you to encourage them to download it to be honest.
        Trust me, it has been attempted. They're just not interested basically out something like spite.
            damn, thats silly of them. they'll come around
                As somebody who is that guy, I've abandoned a lot of games I'd like because I would come home from work and all my friends will be playing without me. It's a symptom of depression and it's not something that you'll just "come around" from.
                    Fellow "that guy" here, I feel ya. It's not even like I'm pouting or anything, I legitimately lose interest in the game when that happens and move on to something else.
                        i recently left my discord/skype/msn group of 10+ years over this, essentially

also happened to be the only 3 friends i had left

oh well
                            Smart. Self-destruction is fun.
                    The worst part about those depressive trains of thought are when there are logical tools you can use to justify it away. In this case they'll just say: "what's the point, even if I played it I'd have nobody to play with because you'll all just be playing together". And the strength of that depressive line of thought intensifies hugely.

I just wanted to clarify for everyone who doesn't have to deal with this stuff personally that it isn't as simple as being hurt by thoughts of exclusion. The worst parts of depression come from those intrusive thoughts that we can make real logical arguments for.
                        Wow that explains so much. I overthink myself to death sometimes. 
                        Oh. I never actually realized that my rationalization could actually just be my imagination... woah
                            It's a powerful thing. 

I've come to realize that a lot of my decision, if not all, in the past that shaped my life were made out of fear essentially. 

I always had tremendously good reasoning for all those decisions and I became very good at making those reasons up as I went along to justify all of it and stay sane.

Can't say I've mastered to see through it all whenever it's happening but I've become a lot quicker in realizing what my actual motives are. 
                    I could understand that feeling in an RPG where you get left behind, but in a quick round FPS BR it seems kind of silly.

I know it's hard when depression is involved, but self exclusion wont help it.

Thats why I said maybe his friend wants to be talked into it and be reassured he is wanted because he feels left out. Just because you aren't in the squad right now doesn't mean you can't be swapped in next game, or when someone leaves.

And if they refuse to play with you then they are probably shit friends 
                Normally I wouldn't argue with this, it's a video game.  However, depression and anxiety is a real thing.

4 People always play together.  Game comes out has 3 people.  One of the group wasn't able to play on the first day. The other three *didn't wait* and played so much they were level 20 by the end of their session.  Fourth guy is available, says "wanna play Apex?" All three say "we played 14 hours yesterday, tomorrow m'k?".  Fourth guy wakes up next day to find his three friends playing together again.   He messages them saying he's up to play.  One of them messages back 10 minutes later with "yea, we'll get you in, hang on, we just started another match".

Behind the scenes the three are having lots of fun, working together, learning each others moves and really doing well.  Where does the fourth guy come in? Which one of the three drops out?  Does it happen right away or does 4th guy have to wait a few more matches until someone gets tired? Does fourth guy have to then drop out after 3 rounds and being level 2?

Not only that but if he hadn't played yet and the other 3 guys are messaging him and saying "no worries, you can have a turn", and they are all high level with a dozen hours in already and did not stop immediately and have him join in, that says something else entirely to fourth guy. People often count the minutes until their SO responds to a text and assign a value to it...it's no different with friends for some. There's really no way to placate someone in that situation without it sounding patronizing in some way.

The "out of spite" thing could be true, but it could also be the said and unsaid signals he's gotten from his friends (or the OP is embellishing or projecting). Plus he could be the one in the group that has social anxiety or other issues.  

Not trying to make a mountain out of a molehill and I am sure this is not the situation here but "He'll come around" is literally why some people take their own lives and honestly, when you dismiss someone else's feelings or emotional state as "silly", that's not cool at all.

                    > Behind the scenes the three are having lots of fun, working together, learning each others moves and really doing well. Where does the fourth guy come in?

Yes literally any of those situations. Not downloading it is self exclusion and ensures you never get to play. Many of my friends and even myself do that, drop in and out, wait in the channel for someone to leave.

I understand how that would feel bad in an RPG when you actually get left behind, I've had those thoughts myself. But in a game as casual as Apex where you can drop in and out I do think it is silly. 

I'm not dismissing the feelings, I have several people in my life close to me, including my SO of 7 years that have severe depression. And it is quite obvious the person wants encouragement to feel involved, hence my very first comment in this chain stating that they want that.

The texting example you use, is something I deal with on the regular. It is silly, and when my SO is in that frame of mind, I need to put extra effort into encouraging her and making her feel better, and then also explain how what she was doing was silly. And having her realise that it is silly and not reasonable, once she is in a better frame of mind, helps her avoid and recognise those thoughts later.

But simply not downloading excludes yourself from all the situations in which you can be included. However this is the slump that depressed people fall into, and OP probably needs to show a bit more compassion and encouragment to their friend if it is the case, because yes, they are being silly. 

>Not trying to make a mountain out of a molehill and I am sure this is not the situation here but "He'll come around" is literally why some people take their own lives and honestly, when you dismiss someone else's feelings or emotional state as "silly", that's not cool at all.

We aren't dealing with the person directly, it's fine to talk about how objectively their rationale is a little unreasonable. Because that can highlight to the OP how maybe they need to have a little more patience and compassion with their friend.

    Emo...
        I wouldn‚Äôt say emo it‚Äôs just that being the fourth is hard because you‚Äôre always last. For example say you‚Äôre the nerdy kid during elementary school. No one is fucking picking you. It progressively becomes worse because of seclusion and bias from other people. The fourth might be a ‚Äúsweat‚Äù or a ‚Äúbot‚Äù people will use these titles to make you the fourth. His reaction was a little immature but you have to step into their shoes. 
            But he wasn't there himself. You have no reason to assume he always gets picked last. He didn't that time either
            What is worse is when someone hasn't played as much, so they aren't very good, but they refuse to queue solo and try to get better, so you are all getting progressively better at the game and you all end up not wanting to play with Boat Anchor McGee.
            I make it a game with the other physically incompetent/willing to bet who will be picked last this time around. I get my strength from other subjects than PE
        I can see where he's coming from. His friends already had time played on the game and are used to it now while he hasn't touched it yet. He doesn't want to join in randomly and hold them back and be a killjoy. 
            So play it solo to get used to it and then don't hold them back? It's just a defense mechanism imo and incredibly insecure. 
                Lmao exactly. It‚Äôs a game. If you like it buy it and play it , if you don‚Äôt move on. What‚Äôs with all the psychoanalysis 
        Should play Wraith

            I'm the only one who play to my standard. Unfortunately it's not very well.

                        I know it's probably a random confirmation bias or something, but I've seen so many mentions of CB-BB this last week, just when I coincidentally decide to continue watching through it. 

Never watched it all the way through before. It's pretty good stuff. 
    [deleted]
        Just keep asking people to add you, or if you can add them when you play well together.  I have like 10 people I played with added so I always have people who I know I can do well with.  Eventually the game will implement an easier friend system.  Its a small problem in an otherwise nearly flawless launch.
            adding people is a troublesome problem, wish it was more fluid like fortnite.
    I'll be your friend

        Is it weird that I read this in pathfinders voice just because he says friend all the time?
            friend
            *Chappie 
    I was going to say,  I play alone...
    Imagine having friends

Haha I'm so lonely
Destiny showed me that as well 

I‚Äôm also sometimes the 7th apparently 
    Dude they gave me the name ‚Äúsoloraider‚Äú but not because i was good tho...
    It‚Äôs okay, grow fat from strength alone.
        Damn. Such an emphasis on alone LOL. 
^It‚Äôs ^definitely ^Valentine‚Äôs ^day ^T_T
    Fuckin ouch dude
    If you're the 7th, you're basically the 3rd of another group of 4. (Just some optimism in this sad world.) 
    This was me. There were three of us who went through Destiny 1 together but my work schedule just didn‚Äôt allow me to do Raids with them. So they asked randoms on Reddit to do Raids and that pretty much became the new group with me excluded. But when they needed a 6th and I was available, I‚Äôd hop in. The new people from Reddit would just criticize me the entire time that I didn‚Äôt know what I was doing and it killed the game for me.

Move into Destiny 2, rinse and repeat. Same exact same thing happened. I dreaded the fact we got to the end game because I knew I would be left in the dark again.
Talked my friends into downloading it. They said they weren't feeling it. Then they proceed to play everyday since its release and never invite me. Feels bad man.
    At least we can take a little comfort in reading this thread and knowing our "friends" aren't *especially* shitty, just regular old shitty like pretty much everyone else.
I just have a large group of friends that are on at different times. I mix and match between the groups if you will lol 

I just play with whoever I was playing with first. If I‚Äôm on for a long period of time for some reason, I‚Äôll just tell my friends I‚Äôm playing with someone else soon
    This is how I go about it as well for the most part.

Brothers take first priority no matter what.
All other people come after and I‚Äôll just play with whoever I was playing with first.
Can't be fourth favorite if you've got zero friends to start with!
    I'm already ahead because there is no one to race!
Can't be the 4th best friend if you have no friends üëâüòéüëâ
First 3 online in discord get the spots. Early bird gets the worm. It's only fair

&#x200B;
    but what happens if the worm was early as well?
        What if the worm carries parasites and the bird goes down also?
            The worm is the parasite
            What if the bird works until 8pm :(
                I feel you :(
    My group just splits into two parties of 2 if we have 4 online.
        Seriously, what‚Äôs wrong with all these people. We go two groups of 2s or often enough someone just takes it as an opportunity to go eat or actually accomplish something.
        Thats what I wish my group would do. But sadly they don't, because they would rather leave out one of us than to have a random on the squad.
            That's not an insane or rude position imo. It's a teamwork oriented game, randoms really screw everything up. I'm sorry about to your group tho :(
                Yeah man can't have randoms stealing my bloodhound
                My friends and I split into 2 groups of 2‚Äôs whenever we have an extra player. Hasn‚Äôt made us enjoy the game any less, and our winrate seems to be about the same (1 in every 8 games or so).
            Yeah. The thing is a 3-stack is infinitely more enjoyable than playing with one random. And 2-stack vs solo isn't that massive of a loss. So we're usually all on discord together and rotating around.
                That's fine too.  You are being inclusive, just in a different way.

  
But all these people talking about how the 4th person is just SOL are garbage.
    God, I'm not a native English speaker... Is that REALLY where the 'early bird' term comes from? From an early bird getting the worm?

I'm honestly mind blown
        Just remember, it's the second mouse that gets the cheese :P
            It really be like that sometimes
        Yep. Weird idiom now that you mention it. 
    Whoever gets the least amount of kills gets kicked out 
        Okay perfect logic here, ding ding... wait all you have to do is wait to steal the others kills (I didn't say that out-loud did I?)
        Wow what a good friend... 
    Except some people have lives and others don't and can be playing a video game for 13 hours a day.
Apex showed me I don't even have two friends to play a game with
Destiny showed us that first.
    I miss getting left out of trails 
    Yep.
I'm the only one of my friends that plays
    Same. One homie I have who actually would just had his gpu shit out :/

Honestly tho, I like playing games solo, even games like this. The few times I‚Äôve played online games with friends has always been awkward, since I hardly do it and aren‚Äôt used to chatting through a mic while also focusing on a game. 
This dudes got it right ^
    Who 
        him
        The dude above him. 
        Not you you‚Äôre under him
Or just worse at games 
lmao is that the VR Chat weirdo?

    He's also actually a really nice guy, just puts on a character.

    Idk why you got downvoted. This is the exact situation my group is in. Our squad has been playing since PUBG, moved to Fortnite, then Blackout. We play apex when we all aren‚Äôt on but as soon as the 4th gets on we switch games to not leave anyone out.  

I‚Äôm having a blast with apex and really want our squad to make the switch. We just can‚Äôt at the moment since four players isn‚Äôt an option. 
        The most you could do is split it in teams of two so no one is left alone. Unless you only want to have your squad in the same match. 
            But then you have to deal with the random and not being able to play with the other two. 

I know I‚Äôm being picky (and I‚Äôm not complaining. It‚Äôs a free game. Just expressing interest in a 4 man mode) but when you‚Äôve moved through 3 different games all with a standard 4-man playlist it‚Äôs kind of a buzzkill when they limit you to 3.

As we‚Äôve gotten older and gone our separate ways in life, playing these games together in the evenings is how we ‚Äúhang out‚Äù with each other now. Why would we play this game separately when we can all play another together? I know you were just trying to offer suggestions and I appreciate that. I don‚Äôt want it to seem like attacking you or not wanting to compromise or anything. Just thought I‚Äôd share where I‚Äôm coming from a little. 
                You aren't picky, now I have to always tell my friends "you guys can play I gotta do something" just so one of them doesn't feel left out
                Yeah I hope they relase a 100 man map with squads of 4. Would be awesome. 
Me and my friends got a golden rule. Either we play together or we go separate ways in teams of 2, with one random.. we‚Äôre 6 friends and we play almost everyday.
    Why would 6 people split into teams of 2? Am I missing something?
        We also split on 2 full teams of 3. But we‚Äôre very competitive and we like to max the chances of us going against each other in a match, so sometimes we do 3 teams of 2 people.
            Lol why people downvoting you 
So relatable üòÖ
still waiting for solos/duos. I hate being up at late hours and not having friends to play with. yeah right I'm gonna trust these <level 10 ass blueberries to help my team lmao

edit: alligator eats bigger number smh
    Hey, this is totally embarassing, but you're using that math alligator wrong. It eats the bigger letter.

Your sentence right now is "I'm not gonna trust these over level 10 ass blueberries".

Oof.
        Mr math alligator... what are ass blueberries?
        Hey, this is totally embarrassing, but the math alligator is on a numeric diet. It doesn't eat letters anymore.
        fuck, typed it quick and hit the wrong one. I went to first grade and learned that I promise ;)
    As a level 14 blueberry, I'm sorry :(
        What on Earth is a blueberry in regards to apex levels?
            Blueberries refers to a brand new player that is on your team. While Apex has individual colors, generally your teammates names are blue. 

"Fuckin blueberry jumped off the map again."
                blueberry sounds so much better than noob :)
            I heard the term used a lot, at first, in Destiny. Upon the radar, those you friend/directly team up with iirc show up as green. Others that are friendly, like indirect teammates or randoms, how up as blue dots on the radar.

Also like in Halo as friendly is blue in general. 

Thus blueberries. Dont know what other games associate the term with what all else tho. 
        worry not, we were all blueberries somewhere along the way :)
        I'm a level 3! üòä high five!
    r/foundthedestinyplayer  


>!damn blueberries...!<
        played the first destiny and didn't like it. never really was a destiny player. blueberry is just a derogatory term for randoms I picked up from friends in Titanfall 2.  (friends who have also never played destiny).
            Oh man, I totally spaced on Titan Fall blueberries! I suppose that literally makes sense, seeing how this is the appropriate subreddit. lmao
        Wait is blueberry a Destiny thing? I've been playing it since D1 launch and just assumed that it was generic game lingo.
            Blueberry is a term for any game with multiplayer. Usually, your team is blue, while your friends are green
            It is a generic term for rando team mates. Never played Destiny but heard it in Battlefield.
    You would be surprised. I've won several games with just blueberries  
    What I found out the people with a gazillion kills only play for themselves engaging everything guns blazing, while noobier people at least try to help out pinging/ supporting and in the end it matters.  
Source: 5 wins full squad against a bunch of "pro" single players who didn't team play. 
    If only there was a official Discord to find players of the same location, age, level and communication abilities...
It‚Äôs also showed me how many e-friends I have. I have to make a decision every night on which group to play with and someone is always butthurt. 

Sorry for the humble brag.
Us: "Can't we split up and do duos at least?"

Them: "Um..."

*sees two friends in apex, on the same group, sitting in lobby, clicks join game and successfully gets 3rd spot*

Me: hey you guys playing ?

*silence*

Me: anyone there ?

Guy 1: yeah we're just taking a break

Guy 2: but spot is already for Guy 3, he's coming in 2 mins

Me: oh...

*leaves group*

4th friend?

7th friend. There's already 6 people online in groups.
So when are they gonna bring Solo, Duos, and 4 person squads in the game?
    I think the devs are just fearful of splitting up their playerbase. At the least i hope they add in a 4 person squad mode.
        are they legit worried? I think 4 man is perfect number, 3 is kind of a sweet spot, but 4 makes it more fun and competitive.
        Splitting up the playerbase won't be a problem, it's a free to play game, other BRs with multiple queues had squads still being the most popular queue a majority of the time.
            Yeah, won't be a problem at all. 25ish million players. Al the hype. Season coming out so soon. Yeah not a problem at all
            Balancing is a bigger issue. Right now the different characters are balanced and built around three man squads. It is much harder for a dev team to balance all the abilities for 4 different modes. This hasn‚Äôt been a problem before because most other BRs don‚Äôt have champions with different ability sets
                I guess the ‚Äúbalancing‚Äù would just be general nerfs to everyone 
        I think the bigger problem right now is only having 60 players per match. If you do quads you're already only starting with 15 teams vs 20 teams right now which still feels pretty empty on the map to me durring the middle of the game. Only played a few matches so far but my experience is either see a squad or 2 when you first drop and then none again til the circle moves a couple times.
            [deleted]
They NEED to add 4-man squads when the map gets bigger. I don't care what anyone says.
    So you wouldn't care if they said 'No'

Alright
    I care
It really shows if you the worst player.  We leave my best friend out all the time... because he sucks so hard he could pull a golf ball through a garden hose.
    Imho that is a shitty thing of you to do :/
    2 of our group rarely break 100 damage. It's nuts, one of them plays overwatch every day.
    well damn that‚Äôs me - i‚Äôm all right in destiny i‚Äôm loving this game but don‚Äôt do really that well here. i have four wins but got carried hard. 
Holy fuck, this is me in this EXACT moment. I am playing solo squad while I wait for my 3 other friends who are playing a full squad....
Me and my 4 other friends play so we always have to split it up a bit. 
Ready player four
Or if all your friends suck at team work...
    Story of my life. Looking forward to a solo mode. 
Hahahaha yeah.. sucks to be them lmfao

Edit: yeah, so.... anybody need 1?
Yeah im just bad at the game so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I say we make a support group for the unfortunate of us who were picked fourth.
Fourth best friend until they see that you‚Äôre getting more kills than all of them combined... then they‚Äôll all be clamoring to be on your team.

Stooooopid question but will 4 player squads ever being a thing or...?
Any PSN players add me TalkingEden 
Destiny did that to me way back in 2014
ddurkin603 on ps4 if anyone needs someone to  play with.
Destiny showed me I'm the seventh.
Jokes on them I'm the no best friend in my group
At least you have friends :(
or you're the 4th worst at fps games
I wish I had enough friends to even play...
Imagine having 4 friends, sounds wild 
I'd be down to play with anyone, but I'm not good at this game. I have a mic and I can listen to instructions and follow though. Add me if you want to play. Good luck out there!  


Playstation: KyleTheLamb
It also allows trolling groups by putting people in forced trios. So I just take someone else‚Äôs preferred character and dip at the drop in. Now we all lose
Hah, Joke's on you. I don't have any friends.
Never me. My friends like winners


.... who am I kidding, I'm a loser
Hey, chin up. Maybe you're not the 4th best friend, maybe you're just the friend that sucks the most at Apex. :) :) :) 
You're always Timur's #1 bae.

Well, #2 after Ziggy. But still in top 3.
Or who‚Äôs the better friend at video games 
Damn I'm the 4th friend. 
Or just the fourth-best friend in your group.
feel you... 
Yo if anyone on here is playing on ps4 hit me up I'll play with you
Good thing I only have 2 friends
When I have 4 people online we just do 2 groups of 2 instead 
damn lol

quick question, if we are having a group of 6 can we play in the same game with two teams
True story. I know that Destiny has the /r/fireteams or something. I wonder if there is something like that here. I'd play with y'all. 
Any decent 4ths/Players left out on Xbox drop me a DM with your gamertag. Always looking for a group to run with :)
Jokes on you, I don't have any friends, HAH!
@chad RIP
This is a reused jokes I've seen from many people the last few day. 
That happened to us this morning. We just split up into pairs and swapped around every now and then.
Squad mates and I switch off and one person will always have a share play on. So whenever someone wants a break or get food, theres at least a stream to watch while they wait. It helps out since one is in the u.k. while we are u.s. so we make sure he gets his gameplay in before heading off to bed. 
Do the devs have any plans to release a single/duos game mode? Or will it be forever three
I am too but I‚Äôm sitting at 5 wins for the night while they are trying for 1 at the moment. It‚Äôs the little things that get you through
Weird how I think I'm the only person who plays with random and encourages nice encounters to keep happening. 

I'm at a point right now where i log into ps4 and I'll get a couple invites from different people to squad up. 

When my friends are busy I squad with the random players I've met and enjoy the game just as much. 
You guys have friends?
Well at least no one has to pick over me... haha

*cries*
Pssh, first world problems, at least you have friends, what you crying for?
I am in the same boat...
F
I found it out when they all bought Black Ops 4 instead and said they didn't plan on playing Apex. Want to guess who was playing Apex as a three man squad last weekend?
Add duos and quads already Respawn. Your player base is definitely big enough now.
We had 3 and one of us had network issues. I said hey ‚Äúdude is online playing the same game!‚Äù... my friend just said ohh and we waited for our friend with the net issue. It was weird 
I'll be your pal, I also medic and have a mic, it ain't all so bad
Nah my group usually says ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry about it, I don‚Äôt wanna break up the team‚Äù so nah 
I only have one friend that plays Apex and he doesn‚Äôt even enjoy it. i just play fill.
Find a new group and use it as fuel to become better than them.
What my groups do is either split into two, if 4 all somehow get on at the same time, or just play it as first come first serve. We‚Äôve been playing since launch like this and haven‚Äôt had any real issues so far 
If you're playing on PS4, after a game where you worked well with someone, go into the dashboard to friends and then recently met and then wonder why the fuck all it's showing you is R6 Siege games from a fucking year ago.
Would‚Äôve much preferred it if there was an option for 4 man squads that dropped you into a separate playlist with 80 players and ONLY other 4 man squads.
Haha! Ha... hah.. :(
Literally me right now. I‚Äôm listening to my 3 friends play 
Blackout showed me im the fifth best friend lmao
[removed]
Reasons I only have one best friend and one gaming friend for ¬£400 Alex 
We need a bigger squad size mode
The flair should be non-fiction lol
What friends?

Not the fourth best friend, just the fourth best Legend. 
And you are posting this on this day, worse than friend-zoned :(
All my friends play other games so I'm alone and I hate playing with strangers
It's easier to get 10 friends online and play 5v5 in League of Legends then to get only 2 online and join them in Apex
Frat house has about 10 players, growing everyday. Message for the squad hook up. 
Me too... me too man. FeelsBadMan
We have set up a first come first served nobody gets hurt feelings
Is it just me or do this game crashes a lot on PS4??
This just hurt me on a personal level
World of tanks did it first.
I only have one friend to play with. Our 3rds always quit early game
Haha Apex showed me that I have no friends! :)
Jokes on you, I barely have two friends.







:(
When we play League of Legends, then there is always that 6th friend on discord who just listen or play solo, but now there are always 5 online, one of them don't want to play any game, 3 are playing Apex or Ranked Flex and the last one must play solo :^)

We are all mature, so we know what's going on without talk so after a hour or more someone always ask if anyone would like to replace him, because he have "to do something", but when someone would like to play cs:go or lol then he asks "@everyone we need 3 to play lol, who wanna?" and first to comment = first to play.
But everyone knows, best friends comes only in pair of 3!
This is heartbreaking!
It cant be so hard to make 4 man squads
Two of my friends play it. Okay two. 

The stars alligned.
Apex has unfortunately shown me that I need to get an actual pc because I can‚Äôt run any games that have come out since 2015 at better than 40 FPS 
I'm the 4th, of 2 different groups. Feels bad man. At least I get to play at like 1am when no one else is available to be the 3rd.
TOO REAL.
Don‚Äôt get me wrong this is funny, but I was told memes aren‚Äôt allowed??
Good things I only have 2 friends!
I don't even have friends 
Destiny did it first. üò≥
:(
God damn this made me laugh hard. 
We are not really close friends, more like online buddies! The rule we follow: first come first serves. But dam I leave work way after they do and end up waiting xD 
If you are looking for a friend, and you are the fourth, add me up!   


Xbox 1: XboxIWentToSpace
Or I'm just dogshit thank you very much.
My friend group is usually of 4-5 people, thank God not all of them showed interest, however, one of my best friends plays with me whenever we both are online. But yeah, having to decide who to bring would suck.
We were always 3 so it isn't that much of a bother
Jokes on all those 4 man squads. We‚Äôve been rolling with a 3 man roster this entire time. 
F this is me 
V I G OMEGALUL R
See I only have two friends so this is the best game ever for us 
Damn !
The friends that I play with constantly bitch and trash talk me :( 
Only have 3 friends and two of them play Apex so it would seem like I'd be their third team member right? Nope, they played with a random and won and since they've been their 3rd member...it's hurts more when you get shafted by someone you don't know
Go make your own team and be better than all of them ... never invite them. 
Haha jokes on you.

I don'tl have any friends!
Hits to close to home :^) 
Duo's to keep friendships alive!! 
Thats soo true
They need to release solos,duos, and squads, really.
4 friends. 3 ps4s. 1 Xbox. Guess who doesn't play with their friends.
Jokes on you League of Legends already showed me I'm the 6th friend :(
Ha. You assume I have more than one friend. 
It sucks as someone whos good at these types of games/has fun, but is incapable of talking to people and making friends. I wish it had a solo mode :/
I do have a solid 3 I play with, but I actually still enjoy playing this game solo. That will probably change in a few weeks when the skill level increases though.
I don‚Äôt have friends that wanna play with me 
Can't wait for solo....
This would be me. Tough days, but that's what the beer is for.
Beefmincetaco - PC 

always looking for people to play with :)
It also shows that I have no friends!
rip fornite
Bold of you to assume i have 3 friends 
The solution is to find 2 more friends and then you got 2 squads going.
More like "who comes first serves first"
Fottnite and pubg showed the 5th best friend.
Too real
*you sit silently in discord and hear someone is leaving*

‚ÄúHey are you guys still playing?‚Äù

1st guy: ‚ÄúUuh nah imma get off‚Äù

2nd guy: ‚ÄúSame I *might as well get off too*‚Äù

Its that ‚Äúmight as well get off too‚Äù that hits ya in the feels. Oh, if you‚Äôre not with him then you won‚Äôt play w me?

Halp me

Edit: wow! thanks silver kind, for the stranger!

Edit: wow! thanks gold kind, for the stranger!
    My friends call this the ditchboi chain. Once someone leaves, even if there was someone waiting to take their place, people start trickling out.
        the ditchboi theorem

honestly you could do some research and prove this correct
        To be honest, after playing a 2 hour sweat session and someone calls they are getting off, you suddenly lose motivation too and just call it a night. 

You definitely don‚Äôt want to have to party up with the bot of a friend just to get repeatedly smoked.  
            [removed]
                Oh god relatable.  
Edit : I just realised I commented on a 4 months old post
                    Don‚Äôt worry it doesn‚Äôt matter how old the post is
            Was almost planning on writing something similar, couldn‚Äôt be any more true.
    Relatable.
        I've been on both sides.

You don't even realise until it's too late. Thankfully now we usually just split into two groups or play another game if it ever happens. 
            Wow I wish my friends had the social competency to understand that.

They always mean well, they truly do. But they're so oblivious sometimes, it's painful.

I'm always down for playing whatever can include everyone online but some of my friends..eh...can't say the same.


                Are you also the worst player in your group? 
                    Definitely not; we play a wide variety of games and there are certainly some I'm the best at, and some I'm the worst at. 
    I've been that 2nd guy before, and it definitely doesn't have to do with you personally. 

When playing a game with someone for awhile, you associate said game with that person. So not playing with them just feels *off*, yknow? Cos your experience with that game is in no small part defined by a person's presence, so the vibe completely changes when they're gone.

Also, if they really wanted nothing to do with you, they'd have played using their personal discord voice chat. 
        i do this so much and for me when one of my friends gets off it‚Äôs more of a reminder that i‚Äôve probably been playing too long and should get off before it‚Äôs too late

edit: i also just don‚Äôt like playing with some people
            Yeah, I no life pretty hard when it comes to gaming so when someone leaves it's a reminder for me to maybe do something else. Or idk, probably just get up for a good stretch and a snack before hopping back on.
            Lmao, yeah I agree with this guy it's not what you're thinking there are other reasons that happens.  


edit: sometimes it's exactly what you're afraid of that happens.
            I‚Äôve been the 2nd and the 1st guy to leave. One of my friends usually gets off right after I do. It‚Äôs just we play games for hours straight and our energy is just drained from it. 
        Yeah one of my best buds definitely the one I played games with just joined the army not too long ago. Games in general feel a little off because we played everything like every weekend and the rest of my buddies aren't as into it as we were.
        Theres also the whole situation where playing with just one other person seems a bit weird. I feel like I need to play with 3 people or more in any kind of multiplayer game. Same goes with group settings. I can never be with just one other friend.
    If it makes you feel any better, when I do this it‚Äôs usually midnight or later in my time zone and I am guiltily making the responsible choice to go to bed. I was going to keep the good times rolling if the squad was going to stay together, but once the squad breaks up in my mind the good times are over. All or nothing. 
        This is me. I'm very willing to stay up late *if we've got momentum*, but I work full time and when someone leaves and it's 12am it's time for me to bow out. Setting up in a new squad just feels irresponsible at that point. Plus my SO would not be happy if I didn't come to bed until 3am lol
    Well it does suck but I can end up on the outs sometimes and one thing i've done to curb that is by being better than them to the point where they all want me on the team to help carry. 

I've even had the most ironic thing happen where I was so much better than them that it became frustrating and made some new friends going in solo and kicking ass. 

If you're a good teammate you'll find it easier to make friends. Don't be afraid to ask the party if they'd like to join up. Winning a game or getting close to it will go a long way. 

    Bro I'll be your new buddy if you want
    I am sorry to everyone I‚Äôve done this two. I am ignorant teenager and I never realized how the other person feels when I say that
    Lol now I feel bad cuz I did that today.
    I feel your pain, anon. 
        This isn't 4chan
    It happens to the best of us, the worst of us just get ignored. At least we get a reply.
    I'm always those guys when it's a friend of a friend trying to join in.
    I tend to get left out cuz I'm the poorest and farthest living of all my friends. Apex being free was my lifesaver, as are most free things. When it's 10pm and my friends are saying that wanna get off I just beg for one more game so I can suck as much love out as I can before I'm alone again. Well I have a SO but she feeds off of the emotions I am trying to generate. 
    Eh I've done this before and I hope that's not what my friends think.

It's really just that I lose track of time playing/bantering with friends. So when someone decides to leave it kind of snaps me back and I'm thinking "oh damn I've been playing for awhile, I should do something else/sleep now".
my mate: "We are all already partied up together but i'll join you and we can duo and the other two can duo"
    Exactly what me and my mates do. 
Worse: you're playing, but another friend gets on and the replace you
    Now that's just messed up bro....
    Get a load of this guy bragging about having 4 friends
    r/2meirl4meirl
    I'd expect if from rando discord members. But friends? You've gotta find new ones
    I cant do that to my pals, like i always tell them ‚Äúi dont like it done to me so why would i do it to you‚Äù üòë
    Has it actually happened to you?
    Oof you might need new friends my guy
ive sent that message a couple of times since apex came out and damn it hurts to say it to them....
Until you're perpetually the fourth friend of every fourth friend group
    If you‚Äôre 4*n* then you‚Äôre 4ever alone
        (Providing n is indivisible by 3)
            It's not.  But it is indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
                This was so funny to me. 
            Unless n is a multiple of 3 all numbers are indivisible by 3
                Unless it‚Äôs an odd number, it‚Äôs an even number

Source: math
                    And this! This! Is why we're the fourth friend.
                    This is brand new information..
        You are never alone ;)

r/apexlegendslfg
            LFG subs are always awful and unreliable. Just use the LFG channel in the discord. 
                I think the entire point of that sub is to show the existence of the discord
                Yes, furthermore if your as sweaty as I am be sure to search for other requirements aside from level. You'll see a LOT of people searching for level 20+, 30+, 40+ etc and in my experience level has absolutely no bearing on skill. I prefer to search for CS:GO rank thresholds like DMG+ and have had better success at landing good players. 
    I wonder if you get paired up with the seventh son of a seventh son and take over the world
    5th man group inc
    That's like 16 friends though, so that counte for something
Same discord channel for all those missing socks as well.
That's basically what we did because we have so many people playing Apex in ours, we created two channels to avoid game cross talk. 
There is a discord for Apex lol. Its pretty sweet
I finally got 2 buddies and now 1 is avoiding the game. I fear he will return to fortnite...
    Do people really play only one game? I play 3 consistently, 2 before this. One just gets old.

&#x200B;

edit: i guess so haha
        generally in pvp games people play only that game to be good at it, I don't understand why casual gaming is disappearing in favour of competetive, but alas. I'm playing like 4 games atm
            Me too, atm I'm playing fifa, RL, cod BO4 and Apex. I dont get why people have this mindset where they have to be gods at a game so they're only allowed to play 1
                Winning is more fun than losing. Also higher level play feels good, likely because you know you‚Äôre winning because you‚Äôre good, and not because you‚Äôre lucky.
                    exactly this.  when I get started playing a game I make it a point to file all the mechanics away in my brain so that I can constantly reference them when playing.  this entails mastering those mechanics first in order to effectively use them in game play consistently and the intensity with which I plat games doesnt really allow for the mastering of multiple games with different mechanical systems.  for instance, I got crazy good at fortnite up until I just stopped playing it, now I'm currently grinding RL and having a blast because im still just getting started and finally getting a hang of things mechanically so now the flood gates have opened and my gameplay can really flourish.  however if I wasnt focusing RL so much then I would probably be average at best with fairly slow progression.  what it comes down to is the high level play, it's awful when you're losing because you dont execute, it's even worse to not know what to do and losing.  things get really competetive when everyone is high skill and thats what makes it interesting to me.  that unfortunately also makes it very hard to keep up w multiple games because I know  im handicapping myself in one or the other by playing both concurrently.

                        Yeah I think casual gamers fail to understand the mental battles going on behind high level play in competitive games. The Japanese word to describe the concept is ‚ÄúYomi‚Äù: knowing the mind of your opponent. The best competitive players are often thinking several steps ahead for themselves AND their opponent. 

This will most often happen after one has gained two things: intimate knowledge of all the game mechanics and muscle memory so strong that your character is an extension of yourself. This requires a lot of time and practice to achieve. However, when you are participating in layers of yomi and you come out on top, it is the greatest feeling in the world.

And muscle memory is a big reason to stick with one game. My main FPS has been R6S for a few years. I have been playing Apex a ton since release and I still can‚Äôt stop trying to lean with Q+E. It causes me to lose quite often. This is also why people will main a single character. Once those abilities become second nature, you can start to think more about what your enemies will do and less about which buttons to press to pull off your combo.
            COD for MP. 

Apex for BR. 

Tekken for Fighting. 

And whatever SP is the flavour of the month. Right now KH3. 

When you play too many from the same genre it get‚Äôs a bit much for me. 
            I noticed this last night on PC. The amount of people with something related to Twitch or YouTube in their username is amazing. "ttv_" or "_yt" every game. 

People just trying to make it big by streaming, gotta get good gameplay clips. Cant have good gameplay if you don't play, etc
            Because you can't just casually play a game anymore without being wrecked by the competitive players. It's no fun losing every fight. 
            People like to win, who knew.
            It's not really about casual/competitive though. Some people just have the mindset of "I'll only play this game until I die, even if I have a 0.2 KDR." Like they are brainwashed or something.

It's sad. Play more games peoples. There's a lot of good ones out there, even if you only play free games.
        Yesterday I played Apex, fortnite, battlefield v, and rdr2. Mind you two of those I played long enough to grab a daily, and most days I play 1 or two, but the rotation is 5 or 6 deep right now. Depends on who is on and what sounds fun. I'm not gonna get gud, so might as well have fun.
        i play different genres of games but no typically im sticking to 1 battle royale or 1 mmo
        >Do people really play only one game

Good (the best) players stick to one game at a time
    Ew
        ooga booga fortnite bad
        Kinda rude but ok 
Relateable, i know they will like it but they refuse to give it a try
    I kept showing them twitch viewers compared to fort and the 10 then 25 million player mile stone.. then they gave it a shot. It‚Äôs free!
        One of my friends refused to get it because he just didn‚Äôt feel like it and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúbitch it‚Äôs FREE‚Äù finally after me playing it for a while he‚Äôs like ‚Äúok I‚Äôll try it‚Äù now we both play a lot.
I got like 7 pals and all are still into league/fortnite     
     
Had to drop the game since the solo experience is that bad for me, sadly
    Hey bro if you would like someone to play apex with drop me an add (I‚Äôm assuming PC) -MattackSC

I‚Äôm always looking for more people to play with since I can‚Äôt often play when my normal group is on.
Hahaha, my buddy tried it for 2 matches, rage quited and uninstalled it
Same. 
I got one. so now we are trying to get one more from our friendgroup but they are not hearing it. seems like they like playing the same games day after day... (dota 2 RB6S)
I convinced 2 friends to play it and they had fun, but for one friend the game had disconnects all the time and my other friend crashed every hour. So they kinda lost interest. :/
We had to put ours down... very sad and a hard choice but it was best for all of us
    did he go quietly?
        Nope... each slam of the car door on his head was just as hard as the last. He is at peace now.
            It‚Äôs not often that I audibly laugh at things on the internet but you got me
            I will guess it took about 15 slams, give or take 20. You did gods work.
                I was pretty hungry and that always throws my estimates off for some reason, your guess is as good as mine
            When I was a boy...
            LOL
            You got me bro I‚Äôm dying
            Fisk?
I know the feel. One member of my group just stopped replying and would give crap excuses.

Been gone for 3 years.

Another one got in a relationship that ended poorly. One of his friends says he's drinking himself to death and the other says he's doing fine. Yup. I'm just as confused.

Gone for 2 years.


Sucks when you go from talking to someone all day for years. To maybe talk once a week or month.

            Yeah sounds like they were dickheads. 
        Sounds like he was considering it for a while and that was the last straw for him or he was crazy one or the other
        Lmao that sounds like y‚Äôall did a lot more than that. 
    I know that feel man <3. Don't make my mistake and delude yourself into thinking you don't need more friends... please acknowledge that they have moved on and now you need to as well. It hurts so much, but it hurts way more when you've been deluding yourself for years.
    One of my best friends from college lives 15 mins away and works in the same office building as me. He started dating a girl about 8 months ago and now he never hangs out, IRL or in Discord. Last night he texts me about trying Apex because his girlfriend is busy so he "has a night free." 

Dude never even got online.
        That is pretty normal behavior from my experience. Every male friend I have ever had has done this. They get a girlfriend and then disappear for a stretch of time, eventually they find their way back. I even did it to them when I met my wife. Its amazing we have any friends at all. [Ladies... cloud the mind.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqFL_JvG2-g)
It's only been one week lol 
    Sounds like it‚Äôs a bigger issue than the game then lol
        Somebody should do a welfare check. Just to see if he's doin alright.  Maybe invite him to go get a pokebowl or something.

                        If your friends can‚Äôt handle not being invited to a 3 player game that‚Äôs full and all the boys wanna play it, fourth friend included, they‚Äôre either being too selfish or are immature. Legit nothing to be upset about. 
                            That's not his point, respect works both ways.

Happily blasting a 3-man squad game all evening long despite being online with 4 is selfish and immature to be honest.

We switch games when a 4th comes online because we want to include our friends, not exclude them, despite them being okay with being sidelined.
                        But I wanna play Apex
            does anyone dare say it?
            Same, I'd recommend endless dungeon it's only ¬£3.00
    Yeah, we had this problem solved ages ago during the days of couch co-op. The only difference now is that you might not be able to watch your friends duke it out when you're on the sidelines
        You can on console. We shareplay our match to the 4th one. That way he's in on the action and can even provide tactical advice on comms!
            Shareplay? This has to be a PS4 thing right?
                You guys could broadcast on Xbox or stream another way with all 3 streaming and the 4th watches all views.
                You can all co-stream on mixer on xbox. It will show all perspectives on one persons channel. 
                yup
How does the most sensible answer only have 5 upvotes right now?

Are ya'll just dicks to your friends?!
    Yeah basically.
        Lol fuck my friends.
            I wouldn‚Äôt expect anything less from my friends either.  I need new friends. Bad. I played the game where I don‚Äôt call them to initiate first for a couple months and have gotten maybe a few texts and no invites. Either they all are hermits now or just don‚Äôt include me anymore.  Sucks getting old.

                I know that feel bro
        i relate. reserved a spot when my boyfriend was playing with his brother, said that i will come on after i eat. i eat, check discord and they are playing as a 3 squad now. i tell my boyfriend to let me know when one of them leaves. im not one to take others spots and im always the one to give my spot away if someone wants to come on, but like, this time i reserved a spot and wanted to play. hours go by, i ask my boyfriend if i will have a spot soon ''i think soon yeah'' hours go by again.. i dont get on any other game bc patiently waiting for one of them to leave any minute now. it gets late and i havent played a single game. safe to say i was pretty sad and disappointed, had a talk with the bf and he said that in the future he would just go duos with me if that happened again. oh well, life of the 4th one and the one who is always willing to give out their spot so ppl use the fact against you that ''you wont mind'' :)
    >Are ya'll just dicks to your friends?!

yes
    Because it was only a few minutes old when you saw it?
With my friends it's first come first server. They're often willing to split into 2's, but playing with 1 other random when you're 2 just isn't very fun. I'd usually rather solo than make 3 other people play with a random. 

However, if there were duo's, that would be great. I wouldn't even care about singles.
    Tbh my best rounds were with 2 randoms, its just alot of fun for me no matter how I play.
        Having fun with 2 non-salty randos is my favorite.
            occasionally you will get a random who shocks you, like, "jesus, this guy is *good*"
            Yeah, the community so far seems really nice, too.
There was never any salt and Ive played hundrets of games already.
                Ive been really impressed by the friendliness and teamwork ive seen so far too. Except in my last game this dude started mocking me me for saying hello and then he passed me jumpmaster but then and his buddy decided to drop on the total opposite direction to me after i jumped. Then he got knocked and i was all "gee, if only i was nearby to help you out" and he fucking lost it, screamed at me, said he wasnt mad, deliberately burned himself to death with his own thermite grenade and then disconnected.

It was the funniest thing ive seen in this game so far
                It‚Äôs still early in the games life but the way the mechanics incentive teamwork is a complete fresh of breath air. 
        Same here. I've won 6 or 7 with mu homies but with randoms I've won at least 10-15 matches. First game in a long time where randoms aren't a bane & actually help. 
            The game is good at forcing co-op/team play. Solo runs usually get you destroyed pretty quick. It's a nice change from squad games where randoms just wander off into the sunset to die.. 
        Same. I‚Äôve only won three times but they‚Äôve all been with randoms haha 

My brother in law and I have played together a few nights but we only made it to #2, because usually the random dies before the final battle and we get rushed by a full squad, and I‚Äôm still learning FPS games üòî

    Not all heroes wear capes 
My friends are not that caring lol
Real friends. Everyone else prolly talks mad shit behind their 4th friends back. 
Same here. We split, me and my bud got a ez dub and the other two scrubs dropped three times during it. 

I still wish we could four man though honestly. 
Now you have a 3rd and 4th friend being bitter about being stuck with each other instead of playing with you.
Adopt a 4th to be your 3rd? üëã

I'm usually solo and down to make new friends. DM me if you're interested! 
    PS4?
        Not you creep
            Cool the downvotes boys that was funny haha
                I'm torn, I wanna downvoted but that was funny.
        PC
Yeah, I hear unicorns can be hard to find
That's how it's going for me too, waiting on duos.
Try and message asking for a 3some
I refused to upvote this comment cuz the number is just glorious 
If you are on pc and still want a 3rd, send me a message. I've got a few groups i bounce around to as the third so im used to hopping in a new duo.
dm me if you want a Gibraltar watching your back :) 
Same, I introduced my friend and now he plays 24/7 and never invites me even if hes playing solo. I asked him if he likes the game and he goes "It's okay, not that great though",  meanwhile it's the only thing he's been playing since I showed it to him like a week ago. 
    Seems like he's lying? He just doesn't want to play with you man. Better off without him.
        Well, could also be that they have nothing better to do and just want to escape into the game and not really talk to anyone or think about anything. Depends on whether or not there are any signs that they're a bit down.
            Ive been there, sometimes its nice to just play games by yourself :) 
            Yeah sometimes I wanna play like Dizzy and just go full aggro to get better and its better to do that in soloQ cause I noticed my friends want to play more slow-paced
        Better completely ghost a friend because he wants to play a game by himself.
    sometimes people just like to play alone 
    Some people have different goals, even for things most people would consider recreational. Don‚Äôt take it personally. 
    Now you know he is not your real friend. I had to learn this the hard way. you‚Äôre better off without him.
        Just because they don't want to play a videogame with someone doesn't mean they aren't a real friend
Hmu if you want to play :)
    Your words say one thing, your username however...
Yeah I introduced some friends to each other over PUBG now I don't exist.
What a n00b! Kidding, it's totally okay to not have any wins. Shit gets hard when you're against what, 57 other people? It's complicated, so all I got to say is that positioning/movement is more key than gunplay. You starting to die? Drink some run the fuck away juice and get your ass in gear, as it's better to run and live than die and have to be collected. Learn to slidejump, and remember that you can do a super-clamper by holding jump as you run at a vertical surface. People mistakenly kinda stand there and trade shots at a distance, but being able to climb a building or slide closer through cover is definitely a skill. Keep working and get better coordinated with friends and you'll get a win! I believe in you!
    Also it's worth pointing out that I honestly get a lot more enjoyment out of socializing with my friends and fucking around when I play BRs. We're somewhat trying most of the time, sometimes we get super sweaty, but it's all just fun. We'll usually have a couple of games where we just loot and chat about shit and then die to the first ppl we see. Then someone will say "alright guys focus the chi this time" and we'll pick a long drop early and place top 3.

Basically all I'm tryna say is that in my experience you don't have to be always going for wins to enjoy yourself. we all play video games to have fun, so do what you think is fun! 
Sounds like your 4th is wanting you to encourage them to download it to be honest.
    Trust me, it has been attempted. They're just not interested basically out something like spite.
        damn, thats silly of them. they'll come around
            As somebody who is that guy, I've abandoned a lot of games I'd like because I would come home from work and all my friends will be playing without me. It's a symptom of depression and it's not something that you'll just "come around" from.
                Fellow "that guy" here, I feel ya. It's not even like I'm pouting or anything, I legitimately lose interest in the game when that happens and move on to something else.
                    i recently left my discord/skype/msn group of 10+ years over this, essentially

also happened to be the only 3 friends i had left

oh well
                        Smart. Self-destruction is fun.
                The worst part about those depressive trains of thought are when there are logical tools you can use to justify it away. In this case they'll just say: "what's the point, even if I played it I'd have nobody to play with because you'll all just be playing together". And the strength of that depressive line of thought intensifies hugely.

I just wanted to clarify for everyone who doesn't have to deal with this stuff personally that it isn't as simple as being hurt by thoughts of exclusion. The worst parts of depression come from those intrusive thoughts that we can make real logical arguments for.
                    Wow that explains so much. I overthink myself to death sometimes. 
                    Oh. I never actually realized that my rationalization could actually just be my imagination... woah
                        It's a powerful thing. 

I've come to realize that a lot of my decision, if not all, in the past that shaped my life were made out of fear essentially. 

I always had tremendously good reasoning for all those decisions and I became very good at making those reasons up as I went along to justify all of it and stay sane.

Can't say I've mastered to see through it all whenever it's happening but I've become a lot quicker in realizing what my actual motives are. 
                I could understand that feeling in an RPG where you get left behind, but in a quick round FPS BR it seems kind of silly.

I know it's hard when depression is involved, but self exclusion wont help it.

Thats why I said maybe his friend wants to be talked into it and be reassured he is wanted because he feels left out. Just because you aren't in the squad right now doesn't mean you can't be swapped in next game, or when someone leaves.

And if they refuse to play with you then they are probably shit friends 
            Normally I wouldn't argue with this, it's a video game.  However, depression and anxiety is a real thing.

4 People always play together.  Game comes out has 3 people.  One of the group wasn't able to play on the first day. The other three *didn't wait* and played so much they were level 20 by the end of their session.  Fourth guy is available, says "wanna play Apex?" All three say "we played 14 hours yesterday, tomorrow m'k?".  Fourth guy wakes up next day to find his three friends playing together again.   He messages them saying he's up to play.  One of them messages back 10 minutes later with "yea, we'll get you in, hang on, we just started another match".

Behind the scenes the three are having lots of fun, working together, learning each others moves and really doing well.  Where does the fourth guy come in? Which one of the three drops out?  Does it happen right away or does 4th guy have to wait a few more matches until someone gets tired? Does fourth guy have to then drop out after 3 rounds and being level 2?

Not only that but if he hadn't played yet and the other 3 guys are messaging him and saying "no worries, you can have a turn", and they are all high level with a dozen hours in already and did not stop immediately and have him join in, that says something else entirely to fourth guy. People often count the minutes until their SO responds to a text and assign a value to it...it's no different with friends for some. There's really no way to placate someone in that situation without it sounding patronizing in some way.

The "out of spite" thing could be true, but it could also be the said and unsaid signals he's gotten from his friends (or the OP is embellishing or projecting). Plus he could be the one in the group that has social anxiety or other issues.  

Not trying to make a mountain out of a molehill and I am sure this is not the situation here but "He'll come around" is literally why some people take their own lives and honestly, when you dismiss someone else's feelings or emotional state as "silly", that's not cool at all.

                > Behind the scenes the three are having lots of fun, working together, learning each others moves and really doing well. Where does the fourth guy come in?

Does fourth guy have to then drop out after 3 rounds and being level 2?

Yes literally any of those situations. Not downloading it is self exclusion and ensures you never get to play. Many of my friends and even myself do that, drop in and out, wait in the channel for someone to leave.

I understand how that would feel bad in an RPG when you actually get left behind, I've had those thoughts myself. But in a game as casual as Apex where you can drop in and out I do think it is silly. 

I'm not dismissing the feelings, I have several people in my life close to me, including my SO of 7 years that have severe depression. And it is quite obvious the person wants encouragement to feel involved, hence my very first comment in this chain stating that they want that.

The texting example you use, is something I deal with on the regular. It is silly, and when my SO is in that frame of mind, I need to put extra effort into encouraging her and making her feel better, and then also explain how what she was doing was silly. And having her realise that it is silly and not reasonable, once she is in a better frame of mind, helps her avoid and recognise those thoughts later.

But simply not downloading excludes yourself from all the situations in which you can be included. However this is the slump that depressed people fall into, and OP probably needs to show a bit more compassion and encouragment to their friend if it is the case, because yes, they are being silly. 

>Not trying to make a mountain out of a molehill and I am sure this is not the situation here but "He'll come around" is literally why some people take their own lives and honestly, when you dismiss someone else's feelings or emotional state as "silly", that's not cool at all.

We aren't dealing with the person directly, it's fine to talk about how objectively their rationale is a little unreasonable. Because that can highlight to the OP how maybe they need to have a little more patience and compassion with their friend.

Emo...
    I wouldn‚Äôt say emo it‚Äôs just that being the fourth is hard because you‚Äôre always last. For example say you‚Äôre the nerdy kid during elementary school. No one is fucking picking you. It progressively becomes worse because of seclusion and bias from other people. The fourth might be a ‚Äúsweat‚Äù or a ‚Äúbot‚Äù people will use these titles to make you the fourth. His reaction was a little immature but you have to step into their shoes. 
        But he wasn't there himself. You have no reason to assume he always gets picked last. He didn't that time either
        What is worse is when someone hasn't played as much, so they aren't very good, but they refuse to queue solo and try to get better, so you are all getting progressively better at the game and you all end up not wanting to play with Boat Anchor McGee.
        I make it a game with the other physically incompetent/willing to bet who will be picked last this time around. I get my strength from other subjects than PE
    I can see where he's coming from. His friends already had time played on the game and are used to it now while he hasn't touched it yet. He doesn't want to join in randomly and hold them back and be a killjoy. 
        So play it solo to get used to it and then don't hold them back? It's just a defense mechanism imo and incredibly insecure. 
            Lmao exactly. It‚Äôs a game. If you like it buy it and play it , if you don‚Äôt move on. What‚Äôs with all the psychoanalysis 
    Should play Wraith
Just be like "nigga get in here" 
Popular people problems...
    I only have two friends that play Xbox.. too my standard. So I found Apex is perfect! 
        I'm the only one who play to my standard. Unfortunately it's not very well. 
            Hey i suck too wanna team up and lose?

                    I know it's probably a random confirmation bias or something, but I've seen so many mentions of CB-BB this last week, just when I coincidentally decide to continue watching through it. 

Never watched it all the way through before. It's pretty good stuff. 
[deleted]
    Just keep asking people to add you, or if you can add them when you play well together.  I have like 10 people I played with added so I always have people who I know I can do well with.  Eventually the game will implement an easier friend system.  Its a small problem in an otherwise nearly flawless launch.
        adding people is a troublesome problem, wish it was more fluid like fortnite.
I'll be your friend

    Is it weird that I read this in pathfinders voice just because he says friend all the time?
        friend
        *Chappie 
I was going to say,  I play alone...
Imagine having friends

Haha I'm so lonely
Dude they gave me the name ‚Äúsoloraider‚Äú but not because i was good tho...
It‚Äôs okay, grow fat from strength alone.
    Damn. Such an emphasis on alone LOL. 
^It‚Äôs ^definitely ^Valentine‚Äôs ^day ^T_T
Fuckin ouch dude
If you're the 7th, you're basically the 3rd of another group of 4. (Just some optimism in this sad world.) 
This was me. There were three of us who went through Destiny 1 together but my work schedule just didn‚Äôt allow me to do Raids with them. So they asked randoms on Reddit to do Raids and that pretty much became the new group with me excluded. But when they needed a 6th and I was available, I‚Äôd hop in. The new people from Reddit would just criticize me the entire time that I didn‚Äôt know what I was doing and it killed the game for me.

Move into Destiny 2, rinse and repeat. Same exact same thing happened. I dreaded the fact we got to the end game because I knew I would be left in the dark again.
At least we can take a little comfort in reading this thread and knowing our "friends" aren't *especially* shitty, just regular old shitty like pretty much everyone else.
This is how I go about it as well for the most part.

Brothers take first priority no matter what.
All other people come after and I‚Äôll just play with whoever I was playing with first.
I'm already ahead because there is no one to race!
but what happens if the worm was early as well?
    What if the worm carries parasites and the bird goes down also?
        The worm is the parasite
        What if the bird works until 8pm :(
            I feel you :(
My group just splits into two parties of 2 if we have 4 online.
    Seriously, what‚Äôs wrong with all these people. We go two groups of 2s or often enough someone just takes it as an opportunity to go eat or actually accomplish something.
    Thats what I wish my group would do. But sadly they don't, because they would rather leave out one of us than to have a random on the squad.
        That's not an insane or rude position imo. It's a teamwork oriented game, randoms really screw everything up. I'm sorry about to your group tho :(
            Yeah man can't have randoms stealing my bloodhound
            My friends and I split into 2 groups of 2‚Äôs whenever we have an extra player. Hasn‚Äôt made us enjoy the game any less, and our winrate seems to be about the same (1 in every 8 games or so).
        Yeah. The thing is a 3-stack is infinitely more enjoyable than playing with one random. And 2-stack vs solo isn't that massive of a loss. So we're usually all on discord together and rotating around.
            That's fine too.  You are being inclusive, just in a different way.

  
But all these people talking about how the 4th person is just SOL are garbage.
God, I'm not a native English speaker... Is that REALLY where the 'early bird' term comes from? From an early bird getting the worm?

I'm honestly mind blown
    Just remember, it's the second mouse that gets the cheese :P
        It really be like that sometimes
    Yep. Weird idiom now that you mention it. 
Whoever gets the least amount of kills gets kicked out 
    Okay perfect logic here, ding ding... wait all you have to do is wait to steal the others kills (I didn't say that out-loud did I?)
    Wow what a good friend... 
Except some people have lives and others don't and can be playing a video game for 13 hours a day.
I miss getting left out of trails 
Yep.
Same. One homie I have who actually would just had his gpu shit out :/

Honestly tho, I like playing games solo, even games like this. The few times I‚Äôve played online games with friends has always been awkward, since I hardly do it and aren‚Äôt used to chatting through a mic while also focusing on a game. 
Who 
    him
    The dude above him. 
    Not you you‚Äôre under him
[Yep](https://youtu.be/WJl-hZqujTA)
He's also actually a really nice guy, just puts on a character.
Idk why you got downvoted. This is the exact situation my group is in. Our squad has been playing since PUBG, moved to Fortnite, then Blackout. We play apex when we all aren‚Äôt on but as soon as the 4th gets on we switch games to not leave anyone out.  

I‚Äôm having a blast with apex and really want our squad to make the switch. We just can‚Äôt at the moment since four players isn‚Äôt an option. 
    The most you could do is split it in teams of two so no one is left alone. Unless you only want to have your squad in the same match. 
        But then you have to deal with the random and not being able to play with the other two. 

I know I‚Äôm being picky (and I‚Äôm not complaining. It‚Äôs a free game. Just expressing interest in a 4 man mode) but when you‚Äôve moved through 3 different games all with a standard 4-man playlist it‚Äôs kind of a buzzkill when they limit you to 3.

As we‚Äôve gotten older and gone our separate ways in life, playing these games together in the evenings is how we ‚Äúhang out‚Äù with each other now. Why would we play this game separately when we can all play another together? I know you were just trying to offer suggestions and I appreciate that. I don‚Äôt want it to seem like attacking you or not wanting to compromise or anything. Just thought I‚Äôd share where I‚Äôm coming from a little. 
            You aren't picky, now I have to always tell my friends "you guys can play I gotta do something" just so one of them doesn't feel left out
            Yeah I hope they relase a 100 man map with squads of 4. Would be awesome. 
Why would 6 people split into teams of 2? Am I missing something?
    We also split on 2 full teams of 3. But we‚Äôre very competitive and we like to max the chances of us going against each other in a match, so sometimes we do 3 teams of 2 people.
        Lol why people downvoting you 
Hey, this is totally embarassing, but you're using that math alligator wrong. It eats the bigger letter.

Your sentence right now is "I'm not gonna trust these over level 10 ass blueberries".

Oof.
    Mr math alligator... what are ass blueberries?
    Hey, this is totally embarrassing, but the math alligator is on a numeric diet. It doesn't eat letters anymore.
    fuck, typed it quick and hit the wrong one. I went to first grade and learned that I promise ;)
As a level 14 blueberry, I'm sorry :(
    What on Earth is a blueberry in regards to apex levels?
        Blueberries refers to a brand new player that is on your team. While Apex has individual colors, generally your teammates names are blue. 

"Fuckin blueberry jumped off the map again."
            blueberry sounds so much better than noob :)
        I heard the term used a lot, at first, in Destiny. Upon the radar, those you friend/directly team up with iirc show up as green. Others that are friendly, like indirect teammates or randoms, how up as blue dots on the radar.

Also like in Halo as friendly is blue in general. 

Thus blueberries. Dont know what other games associate the term with what all else tho. 
    worry not, we were all blueberries somewhere along the way :)
    I'm a level 3! üòä high five!
r/foundthedestinyplayer  


>!damn blueberries...!<
    played the first destiny and didn't like it. never really was a destiny player. blueberry is just a derogatory term for randoms I picked up from friends in Titanfall 2.  (friends who have also never played destiny).
        Oh man, I totally spaced on Titan Fall blueberries! I suppose that literally makes sense, seeing how this is the appropriate subreddit. lmao
    Wait is blueberry a Destiny thing? I've been playing it since D1 launch and just assumed that it was generic game lingo.
        Blueberry is a term for any game with multiplayer. Usually, your team is blue, while your friends are green
        It is a generic term for rando team mates. Never played Destiny but heard it in Battlefield.
You would be surprised. I've won several games with just blueberries  
What I found out the people with a gazillion kills only play for themselves engaging everything guns blazing, while noobier people at least try to help out pinging/ supporting and in the end it matters.  
Source: 5 wins full squad against a bunch of "pro" single players who didn't team play. 
If only there was a official Discord to find players of the same location, age, level and communication abilities...
I think the devs are just fearful of splitting up their playerbase. At the least i hope they add in a 4 person squad mode.
    are they legit worried? I think 4 man is perfect number, 3 is kind of a sweet spot, but 4 makes it more fun and competitive.
    Splitting up the playerbase won't be a problem, it's a free to play game, other BRs with multiple queues had squads still being the most popular queue a majority of the time.
        Yeah, won't be a problem at all. 25ish million players. Al the hype. Season coming out so soon. Yeah not a problem at all
        Balancing is a bigger issue. Right now the different characters are balanced and built around three man squads. It is much harder for a dev team to balance all the abilities for 4 different modes. This hasn‚Äôt been a problem before because most other BRs don‚Äôt have champions with different ability sets
            I guess the ‚Äúbalancing‚Äù would just be general nerfs to everyone 
    I think the bigger problem right now is only having 60 players per match. If you do quads you're already only starting with 15 teams vs 20 teams right now which still feels pretty empty on the map to me durring the middle of the game. Only played a few matches so far but my experience is either see a squad or 2 when you first drop and then none again til the circle moves a couple times.
        [deleted]
So you wouldn't care if they said 'No'

Alright
I care
Imho that is a shitty thing of you to do :/
2 of our group rarely break 100 damage. It's nuts, one of them plays overwatch every day.
well damn that‚Äôs me - i‚Äôm all right in destiny i‚Äôm loving this game but don‚Äôt do really that well here. i have four wins but got carried hard. 
Story of my life. Looking forward to a solo mode. 
My friends call this the ditchboi chain. Once someone leaves, even if there was someone waiting to take their place, people start trickling out.
    the ditchboi theorem

honestly you could do some research and prove this correct
    To be honest, after playing a 2 hour sweat session and someone calls they are getting off, you suddenly lose motivation too and just call it a night. 

You definitely don‚Äôt want to have to party up with the bot of a friend just to get repeatedly smoked.  
        [removed]
            Oh god relatable.  
Edit : I just realised I commented on a 4 months old post
                Don‚Äôt worry it doesn‚Äôt matter how old the post is
        Was almost planning on writing something similar, couldn‚Äôt be any more true.
Relatable.
    I've been on both sides.

You don't even realise until it's too late. Thankfully now we usually just split into two groups or play another game if it ever happens. 
        Wow I wish my friends had the social competency to understand that.

They always mean well, they truly do. But they're so oblivious sometimes, it's painful.

I'm always down for playing whatever can include everyone online but some of my friends..eh...can't say the same.


            Are you also the worst player in your group? 
                Definitely not; we play a wide variety of games and there are certainly some I'm the best at, and some I'm the worst at. 
I've been that 2nd guy before, and it definitely doesn't have to do with you personally. 

When playing a game with someone for awhile, you associate said game with that person. So not playing with them just feels *off*, yknow? Cos your experience with that game is in no small part defined by a person's presence, so the vibe completely changes when they're gone.

Also, if they really wanted nothing to do with you, they'd have played using their personal discord voice chat. 
    i do this so much and for me when one of my friends gets off it‚Äôs more of a reminder that i‚Äôve probably been playing too long and should get off before it‚Äôs too late

edit: i also just don‚Äôt like playing with some people
        Yeah, I no life pretty hard when it comes to gaming so when someone leaves it's a reminder for me to maybe do something else. Or idk, probably just get up for a good stretch and a snack before hopping back on.
        Lmao, yeah I agree with this guy it's not what you're thinking there are other reasons that happens.  


edit: sometimes it's exactly what you're afraid of that happens.
        I‚Äôve been the 2nd and the 1st guy to leave. One of my friends usually gets off right after I do. It‚Äôs just we play games for hours straight and our energy is just drained from it. 
    Yeah one of my best buds definitely the one I played games with just joined the army not too long ago. Games in general feel a little off because we played everything like every weekend and the rest of my buddies aren't as into it as we were.
    Theres also the whole situation where playing with just one other person seems a bit weird. I feel like I need to play with 3 people or more in any kind of multiplayer game. Same goes with group settings. I can never be with just one other friend.
If it makes you feel any better, when I do this it‚Äôs usually midnight or later in my time zone and I am guiltily making the responsible choice to go to bed. I was going to keep the good times rolling if the squad was going to stay together, but once the squad breaks up in my mind the good times are over. All or nothing. 
    This is me. I'm very willing to stay up late *if we've got momentum*, but I work full time and when someone leaves and it's 12am it's time for me to bow out. Setting up in a new squad just feels irresponsible at that point. Plus my SO would not be happy if I didn't come to bed until 3am lol
Well it does suck but I can end up on the outs sometimes and one thing i've done to curb that is by being better than them to the point where they all want me on the team to help carry. 

I've even had the most ironic thing happen where I was so much better than them that it became frustrating and made some new friends going in solo and kicking ass. 

If you're a good teammate you'll find it easier to make friends. Don't be afraid to ask the party if they'd like to join up. Winning a game or getting close to it will go a long way. 

Bro I'll be your new buddy if you want
I am sorry to everyone I‚Äôve done this two. I am ignorant teenager and I never realized how the other person feels when I say that
Lol now I feel bad cuz I did that today.
I feel your pain, anon. 
    This isn't 4chan
It happens to the best of us, the worst of us just get ignored. At least we get a reply.
I'm always those guys when it's a friend of a friend trying to join in.
I tend to get left out cuz I'm the poorest and farthest living of all my friends. Apex being free was my lifesaver, as are most free things. When it's 10pm and my friends are saying that wanna get off I just beg for one more game so I can suck as much love out as I can before I'm alone again. Well I have a SO but she feeds off of the emotions I am trying to generate. 
Eh I've done this before and I hope that's not what my friends think.

It's really just that I lose track of time playing/bantering with friends. So when someone decides to leave it kind of snaps me back and I'm thinking "oh damn I've been playing for awhile, I should do something else/sleep now".
Exactly what me and my mates do. 
Now that's just messed up bro....
Get a load of this guy bragging about having 4 friends
r/2meirl4meirl
I'd expect if from rando discord members. But friends? You've gotta find new ones
I cant do that to my pals, like i always tell them ‚Äúi dont like it done to me so why would i do it to you‚Äù üòë
Has it actually happened to you?
Oof you might need new friends my guy
If you‚Äôre 4*n* then you‚Äôre 4ever alone
    (Providing n is indivisible by 3)
        It's not.  But it is indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
            This was so funny to me. 
        Unless n is a multiple of 3 all numbers are indivisible by 3
            Unless it‚Äôs an odd number, it‚Äôs an even number

        LFG subs are always awful and unreliable. Just use the LFG channel in the discord. 
            I think the entire point of that sub is to show the existence of the discord
            Yes, furthermore if your as sweaty as I am be sure to search for other requirements aside from level. You'll see a LOT of people searching for level 20+, 30+, 40+ etc and in my experience level has absolutely no bearing on skill. I prefer to search for CS:GO rank thresholds like DMG+ and have had better success at landing good players. 
I wonder if you get paired up with the seventh son of a seventh son and take over the world

That's like 16 friends though, so that counte for something
Do people really play only one game? I play 3 consistently, 2 before this. One just gets old.

&#x200B;

edit: i guess so haha
    generally in pvp games people play only that game to be good at it, I don't understand why casual gaming is disappearing in favour of competetive, but alas. I'm playing like 4 games atm
        Me too, atm I'm playing fifa, RL, cod BO4 and Apex. I dont get why people have this mindset where they have to be gods at a game so they're only allowed to play 1
            Winning is more fun than losing. Also higher level play feels good, likely because you know you‚Äôre winning because you‚Äôre good, and not because you‚Äôre lucky.
                exactly this.  when I get started playing a game I make it a point to file all the mechanics away in my brain so that I can constantly reference them when playing.  this entails mastering those mechanics first in order to effectively use them in game play consistently and the intensity with which I plat games doesnt really allow for the mastering of multiple games with different mechanical systems.  for instance, I got crazy good at fortnite up until I just stopped playing it, now I'm currently grinding RL and having a blast because im still just getting started and finally getting a hang of things mechanically so now the flood gates have opened and my gameplay can really flourish.  however if I wasnt focusing RL so much then I would probably be average at best with fairly slow progression.  what it comes down to is the high level play, it's awful when you're losing because you dont execute, it's even worse to not know what to do and losing.  things get really competetive when everyone is high skill and thats what makes it interesting to me.  that unfortunately also makes it very hard to keep up w multiple games because I know  im handicapping myself in one or the other by playing both concurrently.

                    Yeah I think casual gamers fail to understand the mental battles going on behind high level play in competitive games. The Japanese word to describe the concept is ‚ÄúYomi‚Äù: knowing the mind of your opponent. The best competitive players are often thinking several steps ahead for themselves AND their opponent. 

This will most often happen after one has gained two things: intimate knowledge of all the game mechanics and muscle memory so strong that your character is an extension of yourself. This requires a lot of time and practice to achieve. However, when you are participating in layers of yomi and you come out on top, it is the greatest feeling in the world.

And muscle memory is a big reason to stick with one game. My main FPS has been R6S for a few years. I have been playing Apex a ton since release and I still can‚Äôt stop trying to lean with Q+E. It causes me to lose quite often. This is also why people will main a single character. Once those abilities become second nature, you can start to think more about what your enemies will do and less about which buttons to press to pull off your combo.
        COD for MP. 

Apex for BR. 

Tekken for Fighting. 

And whatever SP is the flavour of the month. Right now KH3. 

When you play too many from the same genre it get‚Äôs a bit much for me. 
        I noticed this last night on PC. The amount of people with something related to Twitch or YouTube in their username is amazing. "ttv_" or "_yt" every game. 

People just trying to make it big by streaming, gotta get good gameplay clips. Cant have good gameplay if you don't play, etc
        Because you can't just casually play a game anymore without being wrecked by the competitive players. It's no fun losing every fight. 
        People like to win, who knew.
        It's not really about casual/competitive though. Some people just have the mindset of "I'll only play this game until I die, even if I have a 0.2 KDR." Like they are brainwashed or something.

It's sad. Play more games peoples. There's a lot of good ones out there, even if you only play free games.
    Yesterday I played Apex, fortnite, battlefield v, and rdr2. Mind you two of those I played long enough to grab a daily, and most days I play 1 or two, but the rotation is 5 or 6 deep right now. Depends on who is on and what sounds fun. I'm not gonna get gud, so might as well have fun.
    i play different genres of games but no typically im sticking to 1 battle royale or 1 mmo
    >Do people really play only one game

Good (the best) players stick to one game at a time
Ew
    ooga booga fortnite bad
    Kinda rude but ok 
I kept showing them twitch viewers compared to fort and the 10 then 25 million player mile stone.. then they gave it a shot. It‚Äôs free!
    One of my friends refused to get it because he just didn‚Äôt feel like it and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúbitch it‚Äôs FREE‚Äù finally after me playing it for a while he‚Äôs like ‚Äúok I‚Äôll try it‚Äù now we both play a lot.
Hey bro if you would like someone to play apex with drop me an add (I‚Äôm assuming PC) -MattackSC

I‚Äôm always looking for more people to play with since I can‚Äôt often play when my normal group is on.
did he go quietly?
    Nope... each slam of the car door on his head was just as hard as the last. He is at peace now.
        It‚Äôs not often that I audibly laugh at things on the internet but you got me

    Lmao that sounds like y‚Äôall did a lot more than that. 
I know that feel man <3. Don't make my mistake and delude yourself into thinking you don't need more friends... please acknowledge that they have moved on and now you need to as well. It hurts so much, but it hurts way more when you've been deluding yourself for years.
One of my best friends from college lives 15 mins away and works in the same office building as me. He started dating a girl about 8 months ago and now he never hangs out, IRL or in Discord. Last night he texts me about trying Apex because his girlfriend is busy so he "has a night free." 

Dude never even got online.
    That is pretty normal behavior from my experience. Every male friend I have ever had has done this. They get a girlfriend and then disappear for a stretch of time, eventually they find their way back. I even did it to them when I met my wife. Its amazing we have any friends at all. [Ladies... cloud the mind.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqFL_JvG2-g)
Sounds like it‚Äôs a bigger issue than the game then lol

                    If your friends can‚Äôt handle not being invited to a 3 player game that‚Äôs full and all the boys wanna play it, fourth friend included, they‚Äôre either being too selfish or are immature. Legit nothing to be upset about. 
                        That's not his point, respect works both ways.

Happily blasting a 3-man squad game all evening long despite being online with 4 is selfish and immature to be honest.

We switch games when a 4th comes online because we want to include our friends, not exclude them, despite them being okay with being sidelined.
                    But I wanna play Apex
        does anyone dare say it?
        Same, I'd recommend endless dungeon it's only ¬£3.00
Yeah, we had this problem solved ages ago during the days of couch co-op. The only difference now is that you might not be able to watch your friends duke it out when you're on the sidelines
    You can on console. We shareplay our match to the 4th one. That way he's in on the action and can even provide tactical advice on comms!
        Shareplay? This has to be a PS4 thing right?
            You guys could broadcast on Xbox or stream another way with all 3 streaming and the 4th watches all views.
            You can all co-stream on mixer on xbox. It will show all perspectives on one persons channel. 
            yup
Yeah basically.
    Lol fuck my friends.
        I wouldn‚Äôt expect anything less from my friends either.  I need new friends. Bad. I played the game where I don‚Äôt call them to initiate first for a couple months and have gotten maybe a few texts and no invites. Either they all are hermits now or just don‚Äôt include me anymore.  Sucks getting old.

            I know that feel bro
    i relate. reserved a spot when my boyfriend was playing with his brother, said that i will come on after i eat. i eat, check discord and they are playing as a 3 squad now. i tell my boyfriend to let me know when one of them leaves. im not one to take others spots and im always the one to give my spot away if someone wants to come on, but like, this time i reserved a spot and wanted to play. hours go by, i ask my boyfriend if i will have a spot soon ''i think soon yeah'' hours go by again.. i dont get on any other game bc patiently waiting for one of them to leave any minute now. it gets late and i havent played a single game. safe to say i was pretty sad and disappointed, had a talk with the bf and he said that in the future he would just go duos with me if that happened again. oh well, life of the 4th one and the one who is always willing to give out their spot so ppl use the fact against you that ''you wont mind'' :)
>Are ya'll just dicks to your friends?!

yes
Because it was only a few minutes old when you saw it?
Tbh my best rounds were with 2 randoms, its just alot of fun for me no matter how I play.
    Having fun with 2 non-salty randos is my favorite.
        occasionally you will get a random who shocks you, like, "jesus, this guy is *good*"
        Yeah, the community so far seems really nice, too.
There was never any salt and Ive played hundrets of games already.
            Ive been really impressed by the friendliness and teamwork ive seen so far too. Except in my last game this dude started mocking me me for saying hello and then he passed me jumpmaster but then and his buddy decided to drop on the total opposite direction to me after i jumped. Then he got knocked and i was all "gee, if only i was nearby to help you out" and he fucking lost it, screamed at me, said he wasnt mad, deliberately burned himself to death with his own thermite grenade and then disconnected.

It was the funniest thing ive seen in this game so far
            It‚Äôs still early in the games life but the way the mechanics incentive teamwork is a complete fresh of breath air. 
    Same here. I've won 6 or 7 with mu homies but with randoms I've won at least 10-15 matches. First game in a long time where randoms aren't a bane & actually help. 
        The game is good at forcing co-op/team play. Solo runs usually get you destroyed pretty quick. It's a nice change from squad games where randoms just wander off into the sunset to die.. 
    Same. I‚Äôve only won three times but they‚Äôve all been with randoms haha 

My brother in law and I have played together a few nights but we only made it to #2, because usually the random dies before the final battle and we get rushed by a full squad, and I‚Äôm still learning FPS games üòî

    PC
Seems like he's lying? He just doesn't want to play with you man. Better off without him.
    Well, could also be that they have nothing better to do and just want to escape into the game and not really talk to anyone or think about anything. Depends on whether or not there are any signs that they're a bit down.
        Ive been there, sometimes its nice to just play games by yourself :) 
        Yeah sometimes I wanna play like Dizzy and just go full aggro to get better and its better to do that in soloQ cause I noticed my friends want to play more slow-paced
    Better completely ghost a friend because he wants to play a game by himself.
sometimes people just like to play alone 
Some people have different goals, even for things most people would consider recreational. Don‚Äôt take it personally. 
Now you know he is not your real friend. I had to learn this the hard way. you‚Äôre better off without him.
    Just because they don't want to play a videogame with someone doesn't mean they aren't a real friend
Your words say one thing, your username however...
Also it's worth pointing out that I honestly get a lot more enjoyment out of socializing with my friends and fucking around when I play BRs. We're somewhat trying most of the time, sometimes we get super sweaty, but it's all just fun. We'll usually have a couple of games where we just loot and chat about shit and then die to the first ppl we see. Then someone will say "alright guys focus the chi this time" and we'll pick a long drop early and place top 3.

Basically all I'm tryna say is that in my experience you don't have to be always going for wins to enjoy yourself. we all play video games to have fun, so do what you think is fun! 
Trust me, it has been attempted. They're just not interested basically out something like spite.
    damn, thats silly of them. they'll come around
        As somebody who is that guy, I've abandoned a lot of games I'd like because I would come home from work and all my friends will be playing without me. It's a symptom of depression and it's not something that you'll just "come around" from.
            Fellow "that guy" here, I feel ya. It's not even like I'm pouting or anything, I legitimately lose interest in the game when that happens and move on to something else.
                i recently left my discord/skype/msn group of 10+ years over this, essentially

also happened to be the only 3 friends i had left

oh well
                    Smart. Self-destruction is fun.
            The worst part about those depressive trains of thought are when there are logical tools you can use to justify it away. In this case they'll just say: "what's the point, even if I played it I'd have nobody to play with because you'll all just be playing together". And the strength of that depressive line of thought intensifies hugely.

I just wanted to clarify for everyone who doesn't have to deal with this stuff personally that it isn't as simple as being hurt by thoughts of exclusion. The worst parts of depression come from those intrusive thoughts that we can make real logical arguments for.
                Wow that explains so much. I overthink myself to death sometimes. 
                Oh. I never actually realized that my rationalization could actually just be my imagination... woah
                    It's a powerful thing. 

I've come to realize that a lot of my decision, if not all, in the past that shaped my life were made out of fear essentially. 

I always had tremendously good reasoning for all those decisions and I became very good at making those reasons up as I went along to justify all of it and stay sane.

Can't say I've mastered to see through it all whenever it's happening but I've become a lot quicker in realizing what my actual motives are. 
            I could understand that feeling in an RPG where you get left behind, but in a quick round FPS BR it seems kind of silly.

I know it's hard when depression is involved, but self exclusion wont help it.

Thats why I said maybe his friend wants to be talked into it and be reassured he is wanted because he feels left out. Just because you aren't in the squad right now doesn't mean you can't be swapped in next game, or when someone leaves.

And if they refuse to play with you then they are probably shit friends 
        Normally I wouldn't argue with this, it's a video game.  However, depression and anxiety is a real thing.

4 People always play together.  Game comes out has 3 people.  One of the group wasn't able to play on the first day. The other three *didn't wait* and played so much they were level 20 by the end of their session.  Fourth guy is available, says "wanna play Apex?" All three say "we played 14 hours yesterday, tomorrow m'k?".  Fourth guy wakes up next day to find his three friends playing together again.   He messages them saying he's up to play.  One of them messages back 10 minutes later with "yea, we'll get you in, hang on, we just started another match".

Behind the scenes the three are having lots of fun, working together, learning each others moves and really doing well.  Where does the fourth guy come in? Which one of the three drops out?  Does it happen right away or does 4th guy have to wait a few more matches until someone gets tired? Does fourth guy have to then drop out after 3 rounds and being level 2?

Not only that but if he hadn't played yet and the other 3 guys are messaging him and saying "no worries, you can have a turn", and they are all high level with a dozen hours in already and did not stop immediately and have him join in, that says something else entirely to fourth guy. People often count the minutes until their SO responds to a text and assign a value to it...it's no different with friends for some. There's really no way to placate someone in that situation without it sounding patronizing in some way.

The "out of spite" thing could be true, but it could also be the said and unsaid signals he's gotten from his friends (or the OP is embellishing or projecting). Plus he could be the one in the group that has social anxiety or other issues.  

Not trying to make a mountain out of a molehill and I am sure this is not the situation here but "He'll come around" is literally why some people take their own lives and honestly, when you dismiss someone else's feelings or emotional state as "silly", that's not cool at all.

            > Behind the scenes the three are having lots of fun, working together, learning each others moves and really doing well. Where does the fourth guy come in?

Does fourth guy have to then drop out after 3 rounds and being level 2?

Yes literally any of those situations. Not downloading it is self exclusion and ensures you never get to play. Many of my friends and even myself do that, drop in and out, wait in the channel for someone to leave.

I understand how that would feel bad in an RPG when you actually get left behind, I've had those thoughts myself. But in a game as casual as Apex where you can drop in and out I do think it is silly. 

I'm not dismissing the feelings, I have several people in my life close to me, including my SO of 7 years that have severe depression. And it is quite obvious the person wants encouragement to feel involved, hence my very first comment in this chain stating that they want that.

The texting example you use, is something I deal with on the regular. It is silly, and when my SO is in that frame of mind, I need to put extra effort into encouraging her and making her feel better, and then also explain how what she was doing was silly. And having her realise that it is silly and not reasonable, once she is in a better frame of mind, helps her avoid and recognise those thoughts later.

But simply not downloading excludes yourself from all the situations in which you can be included. However this is the slump that depressed people fall into, and OP probably needs to show a bit more compassion and encouragment to their friend if it is the case, because yes, they are being silly. 

>Not trying to make a mountain out of a molehill and I am sure this is not the situation here but "He'll come around" is literally why some people take their own lives and honestly, when you dismiss someone else's feelings or emotional state as "silly", that's not cool at all.

We aren't dealing with the person directly, it's fine to talk about how objectively their rationale is a little unreasonable. Because that can highlight to the OP how maybe they need to have a little more patience and compassion with their friend.

I wouldn‚Äôt say emo it‚Äôs just that being the fourth is hard because you‚Äôre always last. For example say you‚Äôre the nerdy kid during elementary school. No one is fucking picking you. It progressively becomes worse because of seclusion and bias from other people. The fourth might be a ‚Äúsweat‚Äù or a ‚Äúbot‚Äù people will use these titles to make you the fourth. His reaction was a little immature but you have to step into their shoes. 
    But he wasn't there himself. You have no reason to assume he always gets picked last. He didn't that time either
    What is worse is when someone hasn't played as much, so they aren't very good, but they refuse to queue solo and try to get better, so you are all getting progressively better at the game and you all end up not wanting to play with Boat Anchor McGee.
    I make it a game with the other physically incompetent/willing to bet who will be picked last this time around. I get my strength from other subjects than PE
I can see where he's coming from. His friends already had time played on the game and are used to it now while he hasn't touched it yet. He doesn't want to join in randomly and hold them back and be a killjoy. 
    So play it solo to get used to it and then don't hold them back? It's just a defense mechanism imo and incredibly insecure. 
        Lmao exactly. It‚Äôs a game. If you like it buy it and play it , if you don‚Äôt move on. What‚Äôs with all the psychoanalysis 
Should play Wraith
I only have two friends that play Xbox.. too my standard. So I found Apex is perfect! 
    I'm the only one who play to my standard. Unfortunately it's not very well.

                I know it's probably a random confirmation bias or something, but I've seen so many mentions of CB-BB this last week, just when I coincidentally decide to continue watching through it. 

Never watched it all the way through before. It's pretty good stuff. 
Just keep asking people to add you, or if you can add them when you play well together.  I have like 10 people I played with added so I always have people who I know I can do well with.  Eventually the game will implement an easier friend system.  Its a small problem in an otherwise nearly flawless launch.
    adding people is a troublesome problem, wish it was more fluid like fortnite.
Is it weird that I read this in pathfinders voice just because he says friend all the time?

        I feel you :(
Seriously, what‚Äôs wrong with all these people. We go two groups of 2s or often enough someone just takes it as an opportunity to go eat or actually accomplish something.
Thats what I wish my group would do. But sadly they don't, because they would rather leave out one of us than to have a random on the squad.
    That's not an insane or rude position imo. It's a teamwork oriented game, randoms really screw everything up. I'm sorry about to your group tho :(
        Yeah man can't have randoms stealing my bloodhound
        My friends and I split into 2 groups of 2‚Äôs whenever we have an extra player. Hasn‚Äôt made us enjoy the game any less, and our winrate seems to be about the same (1 in every 8 games or so).
    Yeah. The thing is a 3-stack is infinitely more enjoyable than playing with one random. And 2-stack vs solo isn't that massive of a loss. So we're usually all on discord together and rotating around.
        That's fine too.  You are being inclusive, just in a different way.

  
But all these people talking about how the 4th person is just SOL are garbage.
Just remember, it's the second mouse that gets the cheese :P
    It really be like that sometimes
Yep. Weird idiom now that you mention it. 
Okay perfect logic here, ding ding... wait all you have to do is wait to steal the others kills (I didn't say that out-loud did I?)
Wow what a good friend... 
him
The dude above him. 
Not you you‚Äôre under him
The most you could do is split it in teams of two so no one is left alone. Unless you only want to have your squad in the same match. 
    But then you have to deal with the random and not being able to play with the other two. 

I know I‚Äôm being picky (and I‚Äôm not complaining. It‚Äôs a free game. Just expressing interest in a 4 man mode) but when you‚Äôve moved through 3 different games all with a standard 4-man playlist it‚Äôs kind of a buzzkill when they limit you to 3.

As we‚Äôve gotten older and gone our separate ways in life, playing these games together in the evenings is how we ‚Äúhang out‚Äù with each other now. Why would we play this game separately when we can all play another together? I know you were just trying to offer suggestions and I appreciate that. I don‚Äôt want it to seem like attacking you or not wanting to compromise or anything. Just thought I‚Äôd share where I‚Äôm coming from a little. 
        You aren't picky, now I have to always tell my friends "you guys can play I gotta do something" just so one of them doesn't feel left out
        Yeah I hope they relase a 100 man map with squads of 4. Would be awesome. 
We also split on 2 full teams of 3. But we‚Äôre very competitive and we like to max the chances of us going against each other in a match, so sometimes we do 3 teams of 2 people.
    Lol why people downvoting you 
Mr math alligator... what are ass blueberries?
Hey, this is totally embarrassing, but the math alligator is on a numeric diet. It doesn't eat letters anymore.
fuck, typed it quick and hit the wrong one. I went to first grade and learned that I promise ;)
What on Earth is a blueberry in regards to apex levels?
    Blueberries refers to a brand new player that is on your team. While Apex has individual colors, generally your teammates names are blue. 

"Fuckin blueberry jumped off the map again."
        blueberry sounds so much better than noob :)
    I heard the term used a lot, at first, in Destiny. Upon the radar, those you friend/directly team up with iirc show up as green. Others that are friendly, like indirect teammates or randoms, how up as blue dots on the radar.

Also like in Halo as friendly is blue in general. 

Thus blueberries. Dont know what other games associate the term with what all else tho. 
worry not, we were all blueberries somewhere along the way :)
I'm a level 3! üòä high five!
played the first destiny and didn't like it. never really was a destiny player. blueberry is just a derogatory term for randoms I picked up from friends in Titanfall 2.  (friends who have also never played destiny).
    Oh man, I totally spaced on Titan Fall blueberries! I suppose that literally makes sense, seeing how this is the appropriate subreddit. lmao
Wait is blueberry a Destiny thing? I've been playing it since D1 launch and just assumed that it was generic game lingo.
    Blueberry is a term for any game with multiplayer. Usually, your team is blue, while your friends are green
    It is a generic term for rando team mates. Never played Destiny but heard it in Battlefield.
are they legit worried? I think 4 man is perfect number, 3 is kind of a sweet spot, but 4 makes it more fun and competitive.
Splitting up the playerbase won't be a problem, it's a free to play game, other BRs with multiple queues had squads still being the most popular queue a majority of the time.
    Yeah, won't be a problem at all. 25ish million players. Al the hype. Season coming out so soon. Yeah not a problem at all
    Balancing is a bigger issue. Right now the different characters are balanced and built around three man squads. It is much harder for a dev team to balance all the abilities for 4 different modes. This hasn‚Äôt been a problem before because most other BRs don‚Äôt have champions with different ability sets
        I guess the ‚Äúbalancing‚Äù would just be general nerfs to everyone 
I think the bigger problem right now is only having 60 players per match. If you do quads you're already only starting with 15 teams vs 20 teams right now which still feels pretty empty on the map to me durring the middle of the game. Only played a few matches so far but my experience is either see a squad or 2 when you first drop and then none again til the circle moves a couple times.

the ditchboi theorem

honestly you could do some research and prove this correct
To be honest, after playing a 2 hour sweat session and someone calls they are getting off, you suddenly lose motivation too and just call it a night. 

You definitely don‚Äôt want to have to party up with the bot of a friend just to get repeatedly smoked.

        Oh god relatable.  
Edit : I just realised I commented on a 4 months old post
            Don‚Äôt worry it doesn‚Äôt matter how old the post is
    Was almost planning on writing something similar, couldn‚Äôt be any more true.
I've been on both sides.

You don't even realise until it's too late. Thankfully now we usually just split into two groups or play another game if it ever happens. 
    Wow I wish my friends had the social competency to understand that.

They always mean well, they truly do. But they're so oblivious sometimes, it's painful.

I'm always down for playing whatever can include everyone online but some of my friends..eh...can't say the same.


        Are you also the worst player in your group? 
            Definitely not; we play a wide variety of games and there are certainly some I'm the best at, and some I'm the worst at. 
i do this so much and for me when one of my friends gets off it‚Äôs more of a reminder that i‚Äôve probably been playing too long and should get off before it‚Äôs too late

edit: i also just don‚Äôt like playing with some people
    Yeah, I no life pretty hard when it comes to gaming so when someone leaves it's a reminder for me to maybe do something else. Or idk, probably just get up for a good stretch and a snack before hopping back on.
    Lmao, yeah I agree with this guy it's not what you're thinking there are other reasons that happens.  


edit: sometimes it's exactly what you're afraid of that happens.
    I‚Äôve been the 2nd and the 1st guy to leave. One of my friends usually gets off right after I do. It‚Äôs just we play games for hours straight and our energy is just drained from it. 
Yeah one of my best buds definitely the one I played games with just joined the army not too long ago. Games in general feel a little off because we played everything like every weekend and the rest of my buddies aren't as into it as we were.
Theres also the whole situation where playing with just one other person seems a bit weird. I feel like I need to play with 3 people or more in any kind of multiplayer game. Same goes with group settings. I can never be with just one other friend.
This is me. I'm very willing to stay up late *if we've got momentum*, but I work full time and when someone leaves and it's 12am it's time for me to bow out. Setting up in a new squad just feels irresponsible at that point. Plus my SO would not be happy if I didn't come to bed until 3am lol

    LFG subs are always awful and unreliable. Just use the LFG channel in the discord. 
        I think the entire point of that sub is to show the existence of the discord
        Yes, furthermore if your as sweaty as I am be sure to search for other requirements aside from level. You'll see a LOT of people searching for level 20+, 30+, 40+ etc and in my experience level has absolutely no bearing on skill. I prefer to search for CS:GO rank thresholds like DMG+ and have had better success at landing good players. 
generally in pvp games people play only that game to be good at it, I don't understand why casual gaming is disappearing in favour of competetive, but alas. I'm playing like 4 games atm
    Me too, atm I'm playing fifa, RL, cod BO4 and Apex. I dont get why people have this mindset where they have to be gods at a game so they're only allowed to play 1
        Winning is more fun than losing. Also higher level play feels good, likely because you know you‚Äôre winning because you‚Äôre good, and not because you‚Äôre lucky.
            exactly this.  when I get started playing a game I make it a point to file all the mechanics away in my brain so that I can constantly reference them when playing.  this entails mastering those mechanics first in order to effectively use them in game play consistently and the intensity with which I plat games doesnt really allow for the mastering of multiple games with different mechanical systems.  for instance, I got crazy good at fortnite up until I just stopped playing it, now I'm currently grinding RL and having a blast because im still just getting started and finally getting a hang of things mechanically so now the flood gates have opened and my gameplay can really flourish.  however if I wasnt focusing RL so much then I would probably be average at best with fairly slow progression.  what it comes down to is the high level play, it's awful when you're losing because you dont execute, it's even worse to not know what to do and losing.  things get really competetive when everyone is high skill and thats what makes it interesting to me.  that unfortunately also makes it very hard to keep up w multiple games because I know  im handicapping myself in one or the other by playing both concurrently.

                Yeah I think casual gamers fail to understand the mental battles going on behind high level play in competitive games. The Japanese word to describe the concept is ‚ÄúYomi‚Äù: knowing the mind of your opponent. The best competitive players are often thinking several steps ahead for themselves AND their opponent. 

This will most often happen after one has gained two things: intimate knowledge of all the game mechanics and muscle memory so strong that your character is an extension of yourself. This requires a lot of time and practice to achieve. However, when you are participating in layers of yomi and you come out on top, it is the greatest feeling in the world.

And muscle memory is a big reason to stick with one game. My main FPS has been R6S for a few years. I have been playing Apex a ton since release and I still can‚Äôt stop trying to lean with Q+E. It causes me to lose quite often. This is also why people will main a single character. Once those abilities become second nature, you can start to think more about what your enemies will do and less about which buttons to press to pull off your combo.
    COD for MP. 

Apex for BR. 

Tekken for Fighting. 

And whatever SP is the flavour of the month. Right now KH3. 

When you play too many from the same genre it get‚Äôs a bit much for me. 
    I noticed this last night on PC. The amount of people with something related to Twitch or YouTube in their username is amazing. "ttv_" or "_yt" every game. 

People just trying to make it big by streaming, gotta get good gameplay clips. Cant have good gameplay if you don't play, etc
    Because you can't just casually play a game anymore without being wrecked by the competitive players. It's no fun losing every fight. 
    People like to win, who knew.
    It's not really about casual/competitive though. Some people just have the mindset of "I'll only play this game until I die, even if I have a 0.2 KDR." Like they are brainwashed or something.

It's sad. Play more games peoples. There's a lot of good ones out there, even if you only play free games.
Yesterday I played Apex, fortnite, battlefield v, and rdr2. Mind you two of those I played long enough to grab a daily, and most days I play 1 or two, but the rotation is 5 or 6 deep right now. Depends on who is on and what sounds fun. I'm not gonna get gud, so might as well have fun.
i play different genres of games but no typically im sticking to 1 battle royale or 1 mmo
>Do people really play only one game

Good (the best) players stick to one game at a time
ooga booga fortnite bad
Kinda rude but ok 
One of my friends refused to get it because he just didn‚Äôt feel like it and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúbitch it‚Äôs FREE‚Äù finally after me playing it for a while he‚Äôs like ‚Äúok I‚Äôll try it‚Äù now we both play a lot.
Nope... each slam of the car door on his head was just as hard as the last. He is at peace now.
    It‚Äôs not often that I audibly laugh at things on the internet but you got me
    I will guess it took about 15 slams, give or take 20. You did gods work.
        I was pretty hungry and that always throws my estimates off for some reason, your guess is as good as mine

Lmao that sounds like y‚Äôall did a lot more than that. 
That is pretty normal behavior from my experience. Every male friend I have ever had has done this. They get a girlfriend and then disappear for a stretch of time, eventually they find their way back. I even did it to them when I met my wife. Its amazing we have any friends at all.

                If your friends can‚Äôt handle not being invited to a 3 player game that‚Äôs full and all the boys wanna play it, fourth friend included, they‚Äôre either being too selfish or are immature. Legit nothing to be upset about. 
                    That's not his point, respect works both ways.

Happily blasting a 3-man squad game all evening long despite being online with 4 is selfish and immature to be honest.

We switch games when a 4th comes online because we want to include our friends, not exclude them, despite them being okay with being sidelined.
                But I wanna play Apex
    does anyone dare say it?
    Same, I'd recommend endless dungeon it's only ¬£3.00
You can on console. We shareplay our match to the 4th one. That way he's in on the action and can even provide tactical advice on comms!
    Shareplay? This has to be a PS4 thing right?
        You guys could broadcast on Xbox or stream another way with all 3 streaming and the 4th watches all views.
        You can all co-stream on mixer on xbox. It will show all perspectives on one persons channel. 
        yup
Lol fuck my friends.
    I wouldn‚Äôt expect anything less from my friends either.  I need new friends. Bad. I played the game where I don‚Äôt call them to initiate first for a couple months and have gotten maybe a few texts and no invites. Either they all are hermits now or just don‚Äôt include me anymore.  Sucks getting old. 
That's cold...

        I know that feel bro
i relate. reserved a spot when my boyfriend was playing with his brother, said that i will come on after i eat. i eat, check discord and they are playing as a 3 squad now. i tell my boyfriend to let me know when one of them leaves. im not one to take others spots and im always the one to give my spot away if someone wants to come on, but like, this time i reserved a spot and wanted to play. hours go by, i ask my boyfriend if i will have a spot soon ''i think soon yeah'' hours go by again.. i dont get on any other game bc patiently waiting for one of them to leave any minute now. it gets late and i havent played a single game. safe to say i was pretty sad and disappointed, had a talk with the bf and he said that in the future he would just go duos with me if that happened again. oh well, life of the 4th one and the one who is always willing to give out their spot so ppl use the fact against you that ''you wont mind'' :)
Having fun with 2 non-salty randos is my favorite.
    occasionally you will get a random who shocks you, like, "jesus, this guy is *good*"
    Yeah, the community so far seems really nice, too.
There was never any salt and Ive played hundrets of games already.
        Ive been really impressed by the friendliness and teamwork ive seen so far too. Except in my last game this dude started mocking me me for saying hello and then he passed me jumpmaster but then and his buddy decided to drop on the total opposite direction to me after i jumped. Then he got knocked and i was all "gee, if only i was nearby to help you out" and he fucking lost it, screamed at me, said he wasnt mad, deliberately burned himself to death with his own thermite grenade and then disconnected.

It was the funniest thing ive seen in this game so far
        It‚Äôs still early in the games life but the way the mechanics incentive teamwork is a complete fresh of breath air. 
Same here. I've won 6 or 7 with mu homies but with randoms I've won at least 10-15 matches. First game in a long time where randoms aren't a bane & actually help. 
    The game is good at forcing co-op/team play. Solo runs usually get you destroyed pretty quick. It's a nice change from squad games where randoms just wander off into the sunset to die.. 
Same. I‚Äôve only won three times but they‚Äôve all been with randoms haha 

My brother in law and I have played together a few nights but we only made it to #2, because usually the random dies before the final battle and we get rushed by a full squad, and I‚Äôm still learning FPS games üòî
Not you creep
    Cool the downvotes boys that was funny haha
        I'm torn, I wanna downvoted but that was funny.
PC
Well, could also be that they have nothing better to do and just want to escape into the game and not really talk to anyone or think about anything. Depends on whether or not there are any signs that they're a bit down.
    Ive been there, sometimes its nice to just play games by yourself :) 
    Yeah sometimes I wanna play like Dizzy and just go full aggro to get better and its better to do that in soloQ cause I noticed my friends want to play more slow-paced
Better completely ghost a friend because he wants to play a game by himself.
Just because they don't want to play a videogame with someone doesn't mean they aren't a real friend
damn, thats silly of them. they'll come around
    As somebody who is that guy, I've abandoned a lot of games I'd like because I would come home from work and all my friends will be playing without me. It's a symptom of depression and it's not something that you'll just "come around" from.
        Fellow "that guy" here, I feel ya. It's not even like I'm pouting or anything, I legitimately lose interest in the game when that happens and move on to something else.
            i recently left my discord/skype/msn group of 10+ years over this, essentially

also happened to be the only 3 friends i had left

oh well
                Smart. Self-destruction is fun.
        The worst part about those depressive trains of thought are when there are logical tools you can use to justify it away. In this case they'll just say: "what's the point, even if I played it I'd have nobody to play with because you'll all just be playing together". And the strength of that depressive line of thought intensifies hugely.

I just wanted to clarify for everyone who doesn't have to deal with this stuff personally that it isn't as simple as being hurt by thoughts of exclusion. The worst parts of depression come from those intrusive thoughts that we can make real logical arguments for.
            Wow that explains so much. I overthink myself to death sometimes. 
            Oh. I never actually realized that my rationalization could actually just be my imagination... woah
                It's a powerful thing. 

I've come to realize that a lot of my decision, if not all, in the past that shaped my life were made out of fear essentially. 

I always had tremendously good reasoning for all those decisions and I became very good at making those reasons up as I went along to justify all of it and stay sane.

Can't say I've mastered to see through it all whenever it's happening but I've become a lot quicker in realizing what my actual motives are. 
        I could understand that feeling in an RPG where you get left behind, but in a quick round FPS BR it seems kind of silly.

I know it's hard when depression is involved, but self exclusion wont help it.

Thats why I said maybe his friend wants to be talked into it and be reassured he is wanted because he feels left out. Just because you aren't in the squad right now doesn't mean you can't be swapped in next game, or when someone leaves.

And if they refuse to play with you then they are probably shit friends 
    Normally I wouldn't argue with this, it's a video game.  However, depression and anxiety is a real thing.

4 People always play together.  Game comes out has 3 people.  One of the group wasn't able to play on the first day. The other three *didn't wait* and played so much they were level 20 by the end of their session.  Fourth guy is available, says "wanna play Apex?" All three say "we played 14 hours yesterday, tomorrow m'k?".  Fourth guy wakes up next day to find his three friends playing together again.   He messages them saying he's up to play.  One of them messages back 10 minutes later with "yea, we'll get you in, hang on, we just started another match".

Behind the scenes the three are having lots of fun, working together, learning each others moves and really doing well.  Where does the fourth guy come in? Which one of the three drops out?  Does it happen right away or does 4th guy have to wait a few more matches until someone gets tired? Does fourth guy have to then drop out after 3 rounds and being level 2?

Not only that but if he hadn't played yet and the other 3 guys are messaging him and saying "no worries, you can have a turn", and they are all high level with a dozen hours in already and did not stop immediately and have him join in, that says something else entirely to fourth guy. People often count the minutes until their SO responds to a text and assign a value to it...it's no different with friends for some. There's really no way to placate someone in that situation without it sounding patronizing in some way.

The "out of spite" thing could be true, but it could also be the said and unsaid signals he's gotten from his friends (or the OP is embellishing or projecting). Plus he could be the one in the group that has social anxiety or other issues.  

Not trying to make a mountain out of a molehill and I am sure this is not the situation here but "He'll come around" is literally why some people take their own lives and honestly, when you dismiss someone else's feelings or emotional state as "silly", that's not cool at all.

        > Behind the scenes the three are having lots of fun, working together, learning each others moves and really doing well. Where does the fourth guy come in? Which one of the three drops out?

Yes literally any of those situations. Not downloading it is self exclusion and ensures you never get to play. Many of my friends and even myself do that, drop in and out, wait in the channel for someone to leave.

I understand how that would feel bad in an RPG when you actually get left behind, I've had those thoughts myself. But in a game as casual as Apex where you can drop in and out I do think it is silly. 

I'm not dismissing the feelings, I have several people in my life close to me, including my SO of 7 years that have severe depression. And it is quite obvious the person wants encouragement to feel involved, hence my very first comment in this chain stating that they want that.

The texting example you use, is something I deal with on the regular. It is silly, and when my SO is in that frame of mind, I need to put extra effort into encouraging her and making her feel better, and then also explain how what she was doing was silly. And having her realise that it is silly and not reasonable, once she is in a better frame of mind, helps her avoid and recognise those thoughts later.

But simply not downloading excludes yourself from all the situations in which you can be included. However this is the slump that depressed people fall into, and OP probably needs to show a bit more compassion and encouragment to their friend if it is the case, because yes, they are being silly. 

>Not trying to make a mountain out of a molehill and I am sure this is not the situation here but "He'll come around" is literally why some people take their own lives and honestly, when you dismiss someone else's feelings or emotional state as "silly", that's not cool at all.

We aren't dealing with the person directly, it's fine to talk about how objectively their rationale is a little unreasonable. Because that can highlight to the OP how maybe they need to have a little more patience and compassion with their friend.

But he wasn't there himself. You have no reason to assume he always gets picked last. He didn't that time either
What is worse is when someone hasn't played as much, so they aren't very good, but they refuse to queue solo and try to get better, so you are all getting progressively better at the game and you all end up not wanting to play with Boat Anchor McGee.
I make it a game with the other physically incompetent/willing to bet who will be picked last this time around. I get my strength from other subjects than PE
So play it solo to get used to it and then don't hold them back? It's just a defense mechanism imo and incredibly insecure. 
    Lmao exactly. It‚Äôs a game. If you like it buy it and play it , if you don‚Äôt move on. What‚Äôs with all the psychoanalysis 
I'm the only one who play to my standard. Unfortunately it's not very well.

Never watched it all the way through before. It's pretty good stuff. 
adding people is a troublesome problem, wish it was more fluid like fortnite.

The worm is the parasite
What if the bird works until 8pm :(
    I feel you :(
That's not an insane or rude position imo. It's a teamwork oriented game, randoms really screw everything up. I'm sorry about to your group tho :(
    Yeah man can't have randoms stealing my bloodhound
    My friends and I split into 2 groups of 2‚Äôs whenever we have an extra player. Hasn‚Äôt made us enjoy the game any less, and our winrate seems to be about the same (1 in every 8 games or so).
Yeah. The thing is a 3-stack is infinitely more enjoyable than playing with one random. And 2-stack vs solo isn't that massive of a loss. So we're usually all on discord together and rotating around.
    That's fine too.  You are being inclusive, just in a different way.

  
But all these people talking about how the 4th person is just SOL are garbage.
It really be like that sometimes
But then you have to deal with the random and not being able to play with the other two. 

I know I‚Äôm being picky (and I‚Äôm not complaining. It‚Äôs a free game. Just expressing interest in a 4 man mode) but when you‚Äôve moved through 3 different games all with a standard 4-man playlist it‚Äôs kind of a buzzkill when they limit you to 3.

I don‚Äôt want it to seem like attacking you or not wanting to compromise or anything. Just thought I‚Äôd share where I‚Äôm coming from a little. 
    You aren't picky, now I have to always tell my friends "you guys can play I gotta do something" just so one of them doesn't feel left out
    Yeah I hope they relase a 100 man map with squads of 4. Would be awesome. 
Lol why people downvoting you 
Blueberries refers to a brand new player that is on your team. While Apex has individual colors, generally your teammates names are blue. 

"Fuckin blueberry jumped off the map again."
    blueberry sounds so much better than noob :)
I heard the term used a lot, at first, in Destiny. Upon the radar, those you friend/directly team up with iirc show up as green. Others that are friendly, like indirect teammates or randoms, how up as blue dots on the radar.

Also like in Halo as friendly is blue in general. 

Thus blueberries. Dont know what other games associate the term with what all else tho. 
Oh man, I totally spaced on Titan Fall blueberries! I suppose that literally makes sense, seeing how this is the appropriate subreddit. lmao
Blueberry is a term for any game with multiplayer. Usually, your team is blue, while your friends are green
It is a generic term for rando team mates. Never played Destiny but heard it in Battlefield.
Yeah, won't be a problem at all. 25ish million players. Al the hype. Season coming out so soon. Yeah not a problem at all
Balancing is a bigger issue. Right now the different characters are balanced and built around three man squads. It is much harder for a dev team to balance all the abilities for 4 different modes. This hasn‚Äôt been a problem before because most other BRs don‚Äôt have champions with different ability sets
    I guess the ‚Äúbalancing‚Äù would just be general nerfs to everyone

    Oh god relatable.  
Edit : I just realised I commented on a 4 months old post
        Don‚Äôt worry it doesn‚Äôt matter how old the post is
Was almost planning on writing something similar, couldn‚Äôt be any more true.
Wow I wish my friends had the social competency to understand that.

They always mean well, they truly do. But they're so oblivious sometimes, it's painful.

I'm always down for playing whatever can include everyone online but some of my friends..eh...can't say the same.


    Are you also the worst player in your group? 
        Definitely not; we play a wide variety of games and there are certainly some I'm the best at, and some I'm the worst at. 
Yeah, I no life pretty hard when it comes to gaming so when someone leaves it's a reminder for me to maybe do something else. Or idk, probably just get up for a good stretch and a snack before hopping back on.
Lmao, yeah I agree with this guy it's not what you're thinking there are other reasons that happens.  


edit: sometimes it's exactly what you're afraid of that happens.
I‚Äôve been the 2nd and the 1st guy to leave. One of my friends usually gets off right after I do. It‚Äôs just we play games for hours straight and our energy is just drained from it. 
It's not.  But it is indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
    This was so funny to me. 
Unless n is a multiple of 3 all numbers are indivisible by 3
    Unless it‚Äôs an odd number, it‚Äôs an even number

        And this! This! Is why we're the fourth friend.
        This is brand new information..
LFG subs are always awful and unreliable. Just use the LFG channel in the discord. 
    I think the entire point of that sub is to show the existence of the discord
    Yes, furthermore if your as sweaty as I am be sure to search for other requirements aside from level. You'll see a LOT of people searching for level 20+, 30+, 40+ etc and in my experience level has absolutely no bearing on skill. I prefer to search for CS:GO rank thresholds like DMG+ and have had better success at landing good players. 
Me too, atm I'm playing fifa, RL, cod BO4 and Apex. I dont get why people have this mindset where they have to be gods at a game so they're only allowed to play 1
    Winning is more fun than losing. Also higher level play feels good, likely because you know you‚Äôre winning because you‚Äôre good, and not because you‚Äôre lucky.
        exactly this.  when I get started playing a game I make it a point to file all the mechanics away in my brain so that I can constantly reference them when playing.  this entails mastering those mechanics first in order to effectively use them in game play consistently and the intensity with which I plat games doesnt really allow for the mastering of multiple games with different mechanical systems.  for instance, I got crazy good at fortnite up until I just stopped playing it, now I'm currently grinding RL and having a blast because im still just getting started and finally getting a hang of things mechanically so now the flood gates have opened and my gameplay can really flourish.  however if I wasnt focusing RL so much then I would probably be average at best with fairly slow progression.  what it comes down to is the high level play, it's awful when you're losing because you dont execute, it's even worse to not know what to do and losing.  things get really competetive when everyone is high skill and thats what makes it interesting to me.  that unfortunately also makes it very hard to keep up w multiple games because I know  im handicapping myself in one or the other by playing both concurrently.

            Yeah I think casual gamers fail to understand the mental battles going on behind high level play in competitive games. The Japanese word to describe the concept is ‚ÄúYomi‚Äù: knowing the mind of your opponent. The best competitive players are often thinking several steps ahead for themselves AND their opponent. 

This will most often happen after one has gained two things: intimate knowledge of all the game mechanics and muscle memory so strong that your character is an extension of yourself. This requires a lot of time and practice to achieve. However, when you are participating in layers of yomi and you come out on top, it is the greatest feeling in the world.

And muscle memory is a big reason to stick with one game. My main FPS has been R6S for a few years. I have been playing Apex a ton since release and I still can‚Äôt stop trying to lean with Q+E. It causes me to lose quite often. This is also why people will main a single character. Once those abilities become second nature, you can start to think more about what your enemies will do and less about which buttons to press to pull off your combo.
COD for MP. 

Apex for BR. 

Tekken for Fighting. 

And whatever SP is the flavour of the month. Right now KH3. 

When you play too many from the same genre it get‚Äôs a bit much for me. 
I noticed this last night on PC. The amount of people with something related to Twitch or YouTube in their username is amazing. "ttv_" or "_yt" every game. 

People just trying to make it big by streaming, gotta get good gameplay clips. Cant have good gameplay if you don't play, etc
Because you can't just casually play a game anymore without being wrecked by the competitive players. It's no fun losing every fight. 
People like to win, who knew.
It's not really about casual/competitive though. Some people just have the mindset of "I'll only play this game until I die, even if I have a 0.2 KDR." Like they are brainwashed or something.

It's sad. Play more games peoples. There's a lot of good ones out there, even if you only play free games.
It‚Äôs not often that I audibly laugh at things on the internet but you got me
I will guess it took about 15 slams, give or take 20. You did gods work.
    I was pretty hungry and that always throws my estimates off for some reason, your guess is as good as mine
When I was a boy...
LOL
You got me bro I‚Äôm dying
Fisk?
Yeah sounds like they were dickheads.

            If your friends can‚Äôt handle not being invited to a 3 player game that‚Äôs full and all the boys wanna play it, fourth friend included, they‚Äôre either being too selfish or are immature. Legit nothing to be upset about. 
                That's not his point, respect works both ways.

Happily blasting a 3-man squad game all evening long despite being online with 4 is selfish and immature to be honest.

We switch games when a 4th comes online because we want to include our friends, not exclude them, despite them being okay with being sidelined.
            But I wanna play Apex
does anyone dare say it?
Same, I'd recommend endless dungeon it's only ¬£3.00
Shareplay? This has to be a PS4 thing right?
    You guys could broadcast on Xbox or stream another way with all 3 streaming and the 4th watches all views.
    You can all co-stream on mixer on xbox. It will show all perspectives on one persons channel. 
    yup
I wouldn‚Äôt expect anything less from my friends either.  I need new friends. Bad. I played the game where I don‚Äôt call them to initiate first for a couple months and have gotten maybe a few texts and no invites. Either they all are hermits now or just don‚Äôt include me anymore.  Sucks getting old. 
[deleted]
    I know that feel bro
occasionally you will get a random who shocks you, like, "jesus, this guy is *good*"
Yeah, the community so far seems really nice, too.
There was never any salt and Ive played hundrets of games already.
    Ive been really impressed by the friendliness and teamwork ive seen so far too. Except in my last game this dude started mocking me me for saying hello and then he passed me jumpmaster but then and his buddy decided to drop on the total opposite direction to me after i jumped. Then he got knocked and i was all "gee, if only i was nearby to help you out" and he fucking lost it, screamed at me, said he wasnt mad, deliberately burned himself to death with his own thermite grenade and then disconnected.

It was the funniest thing ive seen in this game so far
    It‚Äôs still early in the games life but the way the mechanics incentive teamwork is a complete fresh of breath air. 
The game is good at forcing co-op/team play. Solo runs usually get you destroyed pretty quick. It's a nice change from squad games where randoms just wander off into the sunset to die.. 
Cool the downvotes boys that was funny haha
    I'm torn, I wanna downvoted but that was funny.
Ive been there, sometimes its nice to just play games by yourself :) 
Yeah sometimes I wanna play like Dizzy and just go full aggro to get better and its better to do that in soloQ cause I noticed my friends want to play more slow-paced
As somebody who is that guy, I've abandoned a lot of games I'd like because I would come home from work and all my friends will be playing without me. It's a symptom of depression and it's not something that you'll just "come around" from.
    Fellow "that guy" here, I feel ya. It's not even like I'm pouting or anything, I legitimately lose interest in the game when that happens and move on to something else.
        i recently left my discord/skype/msn group of 10+ years over this, essentially

also happened to be the only 3 friends i had left

oh well
            Smart. Self-destruction is fun.
    The worst part about those depressive trains of thought are when there are logical tools you can use to justify it away. In this case they'll just say: "what's the point, even if I played it I'd have nobody to play with because you'll all just be playing together". And the strength of that depressive line of thought intensifies hugely.

I just wanted to clarify for everyone who doesn't have to deal with this stuff personally that it isn't as simple as being hurt by thoughts of exclusion. The worst parts of depression come from those intrusive thoughts that we can make real logical arguments for.
        Wow that explains so much. I overthink myself to death sometimes. 
        Oh. I never actually realized that my rationalization could actually just be my imagination... woah
            It's a powerful thing. 

I've come to realize that a lot of my decision, if not all, in the past that shaped my life were made out of fear essentially. 

I always had tremendously good reasoning for all those decisions and I became very good at making those reasons up as I went along to justify all of it and stay sane.

Can't say I've mastered to see through it all whenever it's happening but I've become a lot quicker in realizing what my actual motives are. 
    I could understand that feeling in an RPG where you get left behind, but in a quick round FPS BR it seems kind of silly.

I know it's hard when depression is involved, but self exclusion wont help it.

Thats why I said maybe his friend wants to be talked into it and be reassured he is wanted because he feels left out. Just because you aren't in the squad right now doesn't mean you can't be swapped in next game, or when someone leaves.

And if they refuse to play with you then they are probably shit friends 
Normally I wouldn't argue with this, it's a video game.  However, depression and anxiety is a real thing.

4 People always play together.  Game comes out has 3 people.  One of the group wasn't able to play on the first day. The other three *didn't wait* and played so much they were level 20 by the end of their session.  Fourth guy is available, says "wanna play Apex?" All three say "we played 14 hours yesterday, tomorrow m'k?".  Fourth guy wakes up next day to find his three friends playing together again.   He messages them saying he's up to play.  One of them messages back 10 minutes later with "yea, we'll get you in, hang on, we just started another match".

Behind the scenes the three are having lots of fun, working together, learning each others moves and really doing well.  Where does the fourth guy come in? Which one of the three drops out?  Does it happen right away or does 4th guy have to wait a few more matches until someone gets tired? Does fourth guy have to then drop out after 3 rounds and being level 2?

Not only that but if he hadn't played yet and the other 3 guys are messaging him and saying "no worries, you can have a turn", and they are all high level with a dozen hours in already and did not stop immediately and have him join in, that says something else entirely to fourth guy. People often count the minutes until their SO responds to a text and assign a value to it...it's no different with friends for some. There's really no way to placate someone in that situation without it sounding patronizing in some way.

The "out of spite" thing could be true, but it could also be the said and unsaid signals he's gotten from his friends (or the OP is embellishing or projecting). Plus he could be the one in the group that has social anxiety or other issues.  

Not trying to make a mountain out of a molehill and I am sure this is not the situation here but "He'll come around" is literally why some people take their own lives and honestly, when you dismiss someone else's feelings or emotional state as "silly", that's not cool at all.

    > Behind the scenes the three are having lots of fun, working together, learning each others moves and really doing well. Where does the fourth guy come in? Which one of the three drops out?

Yes literally any of those situations. Not downloading it is self exclusion and ensures you never get to play. Many of my friends and even myself do that, drop in and out, wait in the channel for someone to leave.

I understand how that would feel bad in an RPG when you actually get left behind, I've had those thoughts myself. But in a game as casual as Apex where you can drop in and out I do think it is silly. 

I'm not dismissing the feelings, I have several people in my life close to me, including my SO of 7 years that have severe depression. And it is quite obvious the person wants encouragement to feel involved, hence my very first comment in this chain stating that they want that.

The texting example you use, is something I deal with on the regular. It is silly, and when my SO is in that frame of mind, I need to put extra effort into encouraging her and making her feel better, and then also explain how what she was doing was silly. And having her realise that it is silly and not reasonable, once she is in a better frame of mind, helps her avoid and recognise those thoughts later.

But simply not downloading excludes yourself from all the situations in which you can be included. However this is the slump that depressed people fall into, and OP probably needs to show a bit more compassion and encouragment to their friend if it is the case, because yes, they are being silly. 

>Not trying to make a mountain out of a molehill and I am sure this is not the situation here but "He'll come around" is literally why some people take their own lives and honestly, when you dismiss someone else's feelings or emotional state as "silly", that's not cool at all.

We aren't dealing with the person directly, it's fine to talk about how objectively their rationale is a little unreasonable. Because that can highlight to the OP how maybe they need to have a little more patience and compassion with their friend.

Lmao exactly. It‚Äôs a game. If you like it buy it and play it , if you don‚Äôt move on. What‚Äôs with all the psychoanalysis 
Hey i suck too wanna team up and lose?

        I know it's probably a random confirmation bias or something, but I've seen so many mentions of CB-BB this last week, just when I coincidentally decide to continue watching through it. 

Never watched it all the way through before. It's pretty good stuff. 
I feel you :(
Yeah man can't have randoms stealing my bloodhound
My friends and I split into 2 groups of 2‚Äôs whenever we have an extra player. Hasn‚Äôt made us enjoy the game any less, and our winrate seems to be about the same (1 in every 8 games or so).
That's fine too.  You are being inclusive, just in a different way.

  
But all these people talking about how the 4th person is just SOL are garbage.
You aren't picky, now I have to always tell my friends "you guys can play I gotta do something" just so one of them doesn't feel left out
Yeah I hope they relase a 100 man map with squads of 4. Would be awesome. 
blueberry sounds so much better than noob :)

This will most often happen after one has gained two things: intimate knowledge of all the game mechanics and muscle memory so strong that your character is an extension of yourself. This requires a lot of time and practice to achieve. However, when you are participating in layers of yomi and you come out on top, it is the greatest feeling in the world.

And muscle memory is a big reason to stick with one game. My main FPS has been R6S for a few years. I have been playing Apex a ton since release and I still can‚Äôt stop trying to lean with Q+E. It causes me to lose quite often. This is also why people will main a single character. Once those abilities become second nature, you can start to think more about what your enemies will do and less about which buttons to press to pull off your combo.
If your friends can‚Äôt handle not being invited to a 3 player game that‚Äôs full and all the boys wanna play it, fourth friend included, they‚Äôre either being too selfish or are immature. Legit nothing to be upset about. 
    That's not his point, respect works both ways.

Happily blasting a 3-man squad game all evening long despite being online with 4 is selfish and immature to be honest.

We switch games when a 4th comes online because we want to include our friends, not exclude them, despite them being okay with being sidelined.
But I wanna play Apex
Smart. Self-destruction is fun.
It's a powerful thing. 

I've come to realize that a lot of my decision, if not all, in the past that shaped my life were made out of fear essentially. 

I always had tremendously good reasoning for all those decisions and I became very good at making those reasons up as I went along to justify all of it and stay sane.

Can't say I've mastered to see through it all whenever it's happening but I've become a lot quicker in realizing what my actual motives are.
