Protip: If you’re playing on PC turn your texture detail down to low so all the cosmetics will look like shit. Then you won’t be tempted to buy any. 
    Its a PC shooter, the majority of people do that anyway.
        models up to make them pop out more, just about everything else down to 0.  Vibrancy cranked up in the nvidia control panel to make it look like looney tunes to separate the colors so everything stands out more, brightness and gamma adjusted so there's no dark spots at all.
            In case those are actually your settings, might giving me a screenshot of how it looks?

                Well son, have you ever taken mushrooms?
            That seems really unnecessary, I'd rather keep the game beautiful instead of getting a tiny advantage
        eh you'd be surprised.

The majority of people here might because they care enough to about the game to get decent at it.

But your average player couldn't care less about having the highest framerate possible at all times if they have to sacrifice graphical quality for it.
             lowering quality does not nessicarily increase preformance.
                Specially on this modded source thing they have goin on.

Its primarily for visibility purposes.

I personally think it's pretty stupid unless you are a pro.

I didn't pay a thousand bucks on a graphics card just to put everything on low for some minimal visibility advantage. 
            I might have to disagree, the average player would have a worse PC than people who are more 'hardcore' so they'd turn it down anyway. And the guys who care about fps would also turn settings down.

It's a weird world lol

I would prefer if winning just locked the other 57 people out of the game for some indeterminate amount of time. The talent would funnel upwards, which each game being filled with progressively better and better players, until finally only one squad remains able to play.

This is when the third act reveal happens, that this was all actually a clever way of fighting the Formics, and the final squad has to forever live with the knowledge that they exterminated an entire species.

                Being a fan of the Ender or Shadow series became a lot harder when Orson Scott Card revealed how crazy he was.
                    How crazy are we talking here? 
                        Huge racist and homophobe
                            Aw man he’s been my favorite author all my life. Damn it 😂🤦🏻‍♂️
                        Basically, hes radically LDS and hates gays.
                            I guess I was young enough to not pick up on it back then
                        We're talking comparing Obama to Hitler and saying that his political "goal" would be to lock up all homosexuals crazy. 
                    It's a little funny how he writes incredibly understand and empathetic characters - I genuinely can't imagine any of them except some of the obvious villains like bonzo even potentially being homophobic, or something - but he himself seems to not be that way

                        The irony of judging something ahead of time was already in his books. How the fuck could he be so un-self-aware?

                                Culture of the time? All of the above?
                        Never before or since have I been so let down by an authors personality. I read the books and then found out who he was, what a gross man.
                Does the sub need a Speaker?
                That just means this comment chain has happened before, and probably with similar sounding replies. Clearly not a good sub idea for it to be dead by this repetition.

Ah yes, it's **X**enocide. It's been many years since I read the series.
                    Xeno means relating to a foreigner or foreigners.

As in "xenophobia".


    I know this whole thing is a meme but 

> The talent would funnel upwards, which each game being filled with progressively better and better players,

This would actually be a very cool tournament system. Imagine, winning a game grants you a 'Challenger Token - Tier 1'. Spend this token to queue into a game with only other Tier 1 challengers. The winner of that game gets a Tier 2 token, everyone else goes back to the bottom. 

By Tier 5, 3.2 million champions would be concentrated down to just one single, true, Apex Legend. 
        A single Apex Legend, or... an Apex Predator?
            Earn your right to play Titanfall 3. If you cant even beat some random mook legends, how you gon play TF|3 and be a pilot amirite. 
                Please delete your comment. I'm scared that Respawn will see it, make it a reality, and then I'll never get to play Titanfall 3.
                Yeah, like who the fuck gets killed by a MRVN. I'm sure pilots regard this tournament like pro MMA fighters see karate classes. 
            Instead of “you are the champion” you get “you are the apex legend”
        I mean that's kinda what ranking systems are supposed to do, except you don't go to zero rank every time you lose.
            Yeah but this sounds cool and that’s all that matters
                I’ve already got my forum post draft written up for this system. I’m ready to complain about it being too hard and not letting me win yet.
            Ranking system is good for continuous play. This idea was more of an event focus. Each season has a Champion Series where the most successful players can fight there way to the final Champion Tier, getting them a spot into a publicized Championship game for prize money. I just think it would so cool to enable 'nobody' players to make a name for themselves in the game by literally fighting their way to the top.

The big issue with this is of course greater incentive to cheat.. but I hope that due to the final few tiers having much fewer players, it would be viable to ween any cheaters out of the final Tier championship.
                The bigger issue with this is getting enough people with tier 3 and above tokens to play at the same time
                    I outlined a bit in another comment. Tiers above 1-2 would have a schedule of dedicated match times to consolidate enough players at once. 
        [deleted]
            Fortnite just started a tournament system that's loosely this idea. Only a top percent gets invited to the next one and so on. It JUST started though so we'll have to wait to see if it's dope as hell
        Except probably by Tier 2 queue times would take forever so they'd probably have to have some way to remedy that, like maybe making Tier 2+ games occur at a specific time every week like Dota 2's battle cup that happens every saturday night.
            Yea this is very true. My napkin idea would be to have a pre-designated schedule of matches for each Tier. The schedule would rotate over time so if your Tier game is at 4am you can wait a few days and get into one at a more reasonable time. This champion series would run over the course of an entire season to give everyone ample time to compete. 
    Well played, Orson Scott Card's famous son, Ender Peter Valentine Card.
    I 100% know nothing about Titanfall Lore and thought that they had stolen the name "formics" for a second. 
    I actually would love an event like that! 
        Boy, do I have a book for you!
            Books! There is a whole series, but most people just stop with Ender's Game. The sequels to Ender's Game get very political/religious/allegorical so I can see why people didn't like them as much. Still a good read.  
                It's why there's so much falloff. After Ender's Game/Shadow, the books become radically different
                    With speaker for the dead being the best one of them all!
                        Oh not to knock the books at all, read through the series multiple times, favorite books! I just understand why someone would pick up the second book and be confused. In middle school I put it down
                            Agreed, 14 yr old me had no idea what was going on, or what was being referenced. Still trudged through them. 25 yr old me is now enlightened.
                            I read Speaker first, really enjoyed it, and then went to Game for context.
                                That... Must have been pretty confusing. Interesting order.

Also, MAJOR spoilers. That pretty much ruins book 1.
                I liked the bean series a lot more than the sequels to the Ender series.
                Yea I’ve read em all.  I’m a fan.
                I actually prefer the second book. For rereading anyway. 
    Jeez went dark fast

    to be fair the devs haven't given a shit about the game since 2012, it's just been gutted into a moneygrab scheme. If they're not willing to pay my student loans for a win they're oppressive anti-white bigots
        Apex was *way* better when it was a 2D MMO about wizards.
            I still prefer the realistic dragon mmorpg.

You forgot about 1 share of EA per win also
    This is my favorite reward so far!
    [removed]
        Shroud owns all of EA after 2 months
An apex pack for a win *per day*  would be great.

That means one free possible pack per day.
    This is definitely one of the most reasonable suggestions I’ve seen regarding the packs. 
        But we dont even know what upcoming Battlepass entails lol. We dont have any sort of full understanding of what the rewards are going to be like for progressing. They may be nothing, or it may be great. I think suggestions about what to add are kind of silly when we dont even know what's about to be added with the Battlepass.
            THIS is definitely the most reasonable thing to think. The game has been out for less than two weeks. I hate how fast this sub has fallen into “Make this skin for this character” and “We should get this for winning.” Patience is a virtue people.
                These must all be done by people who don't have the crashing issue, cause that's the only thing I want right now.  I'll worry about cosmetics and loot when I can consistently play the game.
                    I hear you.  My friend and I have finally gotten to a place where we can play with maybe one crash per day of gaming.  

The fixes seem to be so different for everyone which is frustrating.  

The EasyAntiCheat force service to restart on failure seems to have done it for me (along with a clean Origin reinstall).  Played about 4 hours yesterday with just one crash.  Of course, I also toned down my vid mem usage, set VSync to dynamic, and a bunch of other voodoo...so hard to say what really fixed it.
                        Yeah, the huge list of "fixes" I keep seeing is rough, and then there's people going "I did every fix listed and it's still happening" that's real disheartening.
                        Over only had it crash when I maxed the video settings at 4K but had super sampling turned on. 1440P gets a consistent frame rates without the periodic crashes so I'll leave it at that for now.
                    I’ve been playing on console and don’t have the crashing issue for the most part, but even so I’m enjoying the game as is right now. One of the reasons FortNite has stayed fresh for people is thanks to the seasons and staggered updates and additions. I’d like to see this game last a long time so I’m happy to let the devs move at their own pace.
                    Been having the *DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_HUNG* error crash intermittently since release, with 6+ in one night once, and just once in several hours of play the other night, but last night got two CTDs with no error (like many people have been describing) for the first time.

Was hoping I was lucky to have crashes with actual traceable error messages so they'd hopefully get fixed, but now I guess I'm in the same "hope they can get lucky and figure it out" boat as so many others. :/
                    I’ve been playing on and off for the past week on PC and don’t have any issues. I’m running an i7-6700k, GTX 1070 and 12g Ram using Windows 10 Home. I have a 60hz monitor though. I’ve heard limiting frame rates could help prevent crashes. 
                Honestly the only change I ask get made as soon as possible is allowing people to reconnect when they get disconnected. Sucks when your squad is doing really well and someone's internet goes out or the game crashes for just a few moments but they're not able to rejoin that match. Just have the character stand still until they reconnect in a certain time frame.
                    Especially because if they dc and you win , it doesn’t count . The only win tracker is “wins with full squad” and it only counts as a win if you have a full squad . 
                    I wholeheartedly agree. I got extremely salty last night because of a disconnect. I hotdropped with my friend, got 6 kills, set up with a fully kitted longbow and r-301 (two of my favorite guns) and purple shields. It was one of the best starts to a game I've ever had. As we were running to steal a care package, my game crashed and I lost everything. Nearly ruined my night, I was so mad.

If they fixed the crashes, or if I could simply reconnect, I might have won that game. Instead my friend quit and we queued up for another and didn't win for another 4 games or so.
                Seriously.

Am I the only one that's like "hey this free game is alright let's see where it goes"
                All I see is

"We want apex to be fortnite but not fortnite, thx"
                    Not at all. I don’t play FortNite, but its hard to argue its success over the past year. If this game wants to have long-term success it definitely wouldn’t hurt to take inspiration from how FortNite released its content. That doesn’t mean it needs to have the same content.
                        I mean't overall from all of the other comments, not you specifically.

Since this was set as a FTP game all of the kids in fortnite jumped over and now expect fornite shit when that's just not gonna happen. 

Comments like, "Whens the pony skin coming" shit like that.
                            Ah I see now. Yeah that I definitely agree with. Unfortunately that seems to always happen on game subs the more popular the game becomes.
                I'm just thinking it must be great to have so much time to play video games you're already so advanced in this game you've gotten all the free stuff and are no longer satisfied with the free game. 
            I halfway agree, but crates are pretty wimpy imo so allowing one per day which most people won’t get everyday is just a decent little carrot on a stick
            But still you get about the same amount of xp for winning as you do for surviving for a long period of time
        I actually think that's a crazy idea and will never be a reality.

You could earn 100 pounds worth of apex packs in 3 months. Ea won't let that fly. A few crafting materials for wins sure. But an apex for a win? Will never happen. 
            I see your point regarding the potential to earn that many cosmetic items if you were to win a match every day. However, I’m willing to bet the vast majority of players don’t win a match everyday but I could be wrong! 
                And the ones who do are usually streamers and such who already spend TONS on the game and will make their viewers feel like its WAY easier to get the packs than it really is, causing many to become frustrated and just straight up buy the packs since they can't win enough games to keep all the skins like (insert streamer).
                    The people who win aren't streamers it's people who are good at the game not "usually streamers".

There were 10 *MILLION* players, and 1 *MILLION* Consistent players. You really think even 100 streamers winning is the issue?
        I kinda just want like 25 - 100 of those little red coins when a game ends...
        I don't think it's reasonable at all to suggest getting something free in a already free game especially when the something free is 100% trivial and has no game impact
    I think they are going to wait for the battlepass before making any changes to the rewards system.  It's EA, they constantly monitor the spending and receiving of every currency type, what people are buying with apex coins, etc.
    That would mean you get a free equivalent to a dollar every day. Granted, lootboxes are pretty overpriced, but I bet ea would only allow that every few days (2 - 7) or maybe just give a handful of legend tokens.
        Is winning really this easy for you people damn
            Nope, I've won twice. Just saying you're bound to win if you play enough and get some very capable teammates.
                The amount of people who would win every single day just through sheer number of games played is a very small amount of the player-base.

The amount of people who will win every day out of playing like 2 or 3 games per day is also a very small amount of the player-base.

There's not much reason for them to worry about not having anyone to whom to sell boxes when those groups make up such a small part.
                    Your team just needs to drop in a low population area. Your chances will increase dramatically.
            I'm trash, but im almost always top 3 because I kind of know my way around the map enough to not die. As soon as my only choice is fighting im screwed though lol
                Same here. We should go to group therapy 
                    Nah just do what I do and constantly boast to your teammates about your superior "geographical battleground awareness" ^(and then get carried to a win)
            I'd say I usually get a win a day and I play about six matches on average. My win rate is substantially more likely if I have a team that all use mics. The ping system is fantastic but some intricate details still can't be conveyed by a singular ping. 
            Depends on your squad, with random I can usually win 1in3 matches or so. But with my usual squad we win about 80% of our games. In our usual 4-5 hour nightly sessions our minimum wins has been 10 per session since release.
                Jesus you’re good 
            Easy? No. Frequent? Eh, kinda. If I’m playing with my friends I can usually get a win or two a day guaranteed. We had about 5 wins on a 3hr session a few days ago. 
            I've won 20 games in 80 tries. My one friend who is wayyyy too good at this shit has about 35 in 85. 
        So the people who are really good at it would get $365 worth per year. That would be a pretty big opportunity cost. 
            Well if you ever had a trash freemium app, dailies are their bread and butter. It means you have to log in everyday. If youre a cheap bastard it doesnt mean much but on a large scale they probably profit from it.
        This isn't ever a valid argument. Just because the lootboxes cost $1 does not mean they are worth $1. To produce an apex lootbox cost the devs next to nothing, they could create 10 trillion. I could make a game and charge $100 a lootbox and give 1 free to every player every day just for logging in. That does not mean the players are getting $100 worth of value (before or after opening).

I get they can't just give everything away. But don't try to equate some arbitrary price they made for a random gambling lootbox (where they also create the winning odds) to a value in the real world just because they are giving it away for free. They are not giving away a dollars worth of value to me. I can not trade apex packs for anything of value in the real world.
            Yeah what you’re not accounting for is potential lost revenue in the form of those “free boxes”. I’m sure if this was implemented, the CFO over at EA would calculate every free loot box that was given away, and he’d have a stroke after realizing all the money the company could have had. 
            when they're pricing individual legendaries at 11 to 18 dollars, probably no matter what comes out of the box the total is worth $1+ in equivalence. 
        [deleted]
    I would be fine with a pack per win per week. Maybe a challenge for time played in the week. 2 crates a week. 

1 crate a day is honestly a lot for these types of games I feel, especially with no dupes and a 7.5% chance to get a legendary. We also haven't got our battle pass yet.

At this point I would take anything because after level 50 you only get 1 crate every 4 levels. 72,000 xp=one crate.
    Or go the Overwatch Arcade route and have 1 pack per 3 games won, up to a maximum of 3 packs for 9 games won per week.
    How about 1 thing instead of a pack
    Not in this thread you entitled gamer. Its a free game you'll owe the devs for the rest of your life for merely looking at the game and not paying them anything /s
Sex is cool, have you ever won a match in Apex while fighting 2 teams at a time?
    Sex is cool, but have you won a round of Apex after your teammates dipped at the beginning?
Dont agree. Rewards are too low. Maybe a buff then this will be a good idea  /s
    Rewards should be real life currency, bitcoin, or vbucks 
        Lmao I’ll send you 2000 vbucks for the joke
            Do you need my credit card number, the expiration date and the three wacky numbers on the back? 
Such a great post. Me screaming “Let’s goooo” and having a great time with friends after we win is enough of a reward for me. 
    For real my dude. That's all that matters. 
    I know im going to sound like an annoying ass boomer, but it really is the new generation of gamers that complain about not enough rewards. I remember playing the OG cod's and halo's for the pure fun of the game for hundreds of hours. This games been out a single week and people are asking for more rewards as if thats the sole reason to play a game. 
        its because these games are designed to tease you with cosmetics and then make them really hard to get , unless you pay money, 

if the cosmetics were never in the game ppl wouldnt be asking for them
            It comes down to not being a bitch.

Somewhere, a psychologist, an economist, and a game developer sat in a room devising how to turn  the players into their bitch and make you feel compelled to buy shiny stuff.

They are betting people can't help themselves - show them better, or accept the fact that they won.
                i've never bought microtransations, (apart from 10 euro on overwatch over 1500 hrs played)

was just explaining to the guy above me why people want more rewards - so they can get the carrot on the stick thats been put in front of them
            The other thing they should do is to just have a set of cosmetics attainable through achievements, like some of the badges are now.

I guess they don't want to as it would 'devalue the premium cosmetics' but I remember back in uncharted 2 when people had skins for reaching super high ranks, you got one for a certain number of kills in a game etc.

You could add in a skin for each character if that player has done certain achievements in titanfall 2 and possibly get players interested in that too (like GW2 does with some GW1 achievements).

The badges are cool and all, and tbh I have much more respect for a player with one of the harder to get badges than I ever would for a legendary skin, but they're still pretty subtle (unless you happen to be the champions).
        That's the result of freemium game gambling addiction. Not that this game isn't fun, but you shouldn't be confused as to why people ask for rewards and get greedy so quickly when that is what devs have been selling them for the better part of 3 years now. 
    Amen
    Same, except instead of the let's gooooo I say "thanks for the carry" then slink back to menu 
    I think for a lot of people (myself included) it's less about wanting a reward and more just wanting an incentive. Even if it's an astronomically small one, at least I'd have a reason to come back. I usually find that once I've played the game a few times and got a win, there's no further reason to come back, nothing to work towards, and I stop playing after a week tops. This is why the battlepass in fortnite works, but currently there's no incentive to stay with this game.
do we already need a circlejerk version of this sub?
    r/apexlegendscirclejerk
I want an epic slow mo of the last kill and confetti and fireworks and the hosts to give you a big ass trophy for winning 
    This would actually be cool to go with the celebrity  competition theme.
You're playing Titanfall 3 😉😋
    Don’t say that :( 
        Ya I hope not too🤞 just making a joke 😁
            Haha all good bro I really hope they choose to make a titanfall 3, I love the series so much 
                I've actually never been a fan of BRs... but its the "Titanfall style" that is incorporated in this game that makes it so awesome imo.

I played Titanfall 2 and love it too (never played original), and its awesome to see them "evolve" their games.
                    Yeah definitely, having so many hours in titanfall 2, Apex felt like second nature as soon as I started playing. I have actually been a fan of BRS since playing them but Apex is my favourite 
                        One thing I noticed was the movement came super naturally to me. Jumping, sliding, wall climbing all felt familiar a few games in.
                            The only thing I *think* is different is that sprinting doesn't take you out of (toggle) ads. I feel like that was a thing in Titanfall and while I'm not sure, I've definitely died a few times because I thought I was
                                Maybe because sprint button is also the scope zoom toggle button, by default? Not sure if it'd change if you were to unbind the zoom toggle button. 
                                I feel like it was too, and if it wasn't Titanfall it's definitely like that in most other FPSs.
                    Yeah the combat in other BRs always felt off for me, I was awful at it compared to other shooters. I'm used to playing Titanfall so that transition felt so much more natural
                I thought they already said tf3 was canceled?
                    They did
                This exchange is too wholesome and positive for a shitpost, someone talk shit quick.
        They said they're releasing another full game in the Titanfall universe later this year at least. Maybe Titanfall 3, maybe something else.
    Haha oh god it hurts so much
        Not as much as it hurt Respawn to make the best shooter of the year and have no one play it.
            Further proving the importance of good marketing
            I miss my Tone. God did she piss people off before her Nerf.

    # SHUT YOUR FILTHY MOUTH
    Don't say that ...ever.
    Apex is very clearly PilotFall
        Except no pilots? 
[removed]
    Fill me in, I don't play a lot of battle royales, is a prize for winning just not a thing? Personally I think it could make people more cautious and hidey which I find very boring.
        You get more experience for surviving longer, so winning gives you more experience in that sense.

Edit: you also get a bonus 900exp for winning. 

Everyone likes to scream entitled but money has nothing to do with it for a lot of people. Some people just want a sort of progression/reward system.

The more you level up the less loot boxes you get too. So that, combined with no extra prizes for winning is pretty disappointing for a lot of people. 
            There hasn’t been a battle royale where you get prizes for winning. Why are people all of a sudden surprised a F2P game doesn’t have them..? 
                Maybe not but I've seen people ask for it plenty of times. 

Would always see posts or r/pubatlegorunds asking for something for winning a match.
                    you get a lot more BP in pubg when you win. I. Apex I get 4500xp for just being a live to the end the 900xp is fine but it feels so little comped to just being a live. 
            It's not just for survival time, you also get a 900xp bonus for winning.
        There arent a whole lot of multiplayer games in general that give you cosmetics/loot just for winning a match. Overwatch is a full price game that uses the same reward system as Apex. 
        It's not a Battle Royale thing, you do get stuff, you get get extra experience for winning and placing high. This is more an issue of people not being satisfied that a free to play game isn't giving them enough loot and they're scrounging for ways to get more for free. The entitelement is fucking thick. We get the most polished and amazing BR game in existence for free which still gives you a ton of free skins and yet people are crying that it's not enough.
            [deleted]
            H1Z1, the first big battle royale, gave out in game items. Theres no fucking entitlement lmao. It's so much more rewarding to actually get a reward than EXP.
    Crazy that ***not everyone agrees with your opinion.***
        Everyone wants free shit.

***Not everyone feels entitled to it just because they play a FREE game.***
            I just want more exp for winning than I get for surviving 5 minutes.
                Unless you are ending games as the victor in 5 minutes then you are earning more XP when you win.  Especially when you get the 500 champion XP the next round you play.  

    Because people aren't asking for shit that is going to bankrupt respawn and EA. If you earn just 10 crafting material per win, it takes 120 wins to get any legendary. I bet 90% of the people here won't even see 120 total wins in 1000 hours. 
Seems to little, how bout this. A free copy of Titanfall 4
Actually, yes I was very satisfied with my 1 win because it took 100 games to get there.
    Yes I have only won once and my 11 year old son was a big part of that 
    I just had my first win in about a 100 games as well, most of them ending within 5 minutes.

Carried my squad of rando's. GF next to me on the couch with that look on her face only GF's can have watching their loved one acting like a 5 year old jumping on the couch, fist pumping and chanting YES YES YES LETS GO BOYS. 

So yeah, rewarding enough. On to the next 100 games.
        "And this is how I spend valentine's day..."
        Lucky. My wife won't even watch me for 15 seconds lol. 
Someone should make a petition about this
Should have added the heirloom too lmao
We gotta let them take their time with TF3. It'll be great.
I believe this is what they call a quality shitpost.
I think they should just troll and say "we heard you guys want some endgame rewards" then give one crafting material for a win. 
Where can I select Free Girlfriend
I'd like a poorly designed screen telling me my arbitrary stats and that I had won a meal consisting of a bird.
I was thinking of making a post just like this, people keep asking for all this free shit for the game even though the game itself is free and fun and everything else is purely cosmetic. Thank you for doing the dirty work for me OP.
Jokes aside I feel like a rainbow six style Apex pack roll would be cool for winning. For every win you add a higher percentage of unlocking a pack. 
Yeah. such wins should be motivating. dunno like 50 Apex coins or smth. 
May i remind you that Respawn entertainment still uses Source engine, which is an engine developed by valve. By no circumstances is it possible to create a game with the number 3 on its title, so the third option is not possible by any means.
If I win, I want a WinRar premium version
Is it really too much to ask for some crafting mats or something when I level or win? 5 a level. 5 for a win. 

Getting crates every 4 levels has become quite frustrating.
You can buy like 2 skins with 1 mil apex coins 
    and most of the skins are nothing special
Everyone already gets a free copy of Titanfall 3 after winning a game of Titanfall 3.
    Hold up
Why cant they just permanently ban every other player that doesnt win😤
titanfall 3. I be real i really just want a copy of titanfall 2 
Getting a win is all the encouragement I need. 
I love the shitpost but honestly I love this whole champion system. I feel like I’m playing hunger games with the banners around the map showing the kill leader and champion. It’s so satisfying hearing “You killed the champion” or “You are the kill leader”. No Battle Royale has gotten my attention like this one. Winning a match just for next game so everyone knows that I AM THE CHAMPION!
While I’d like a cool little reward for winning, that previous post was ridiculous. No bloody way in any universe would a free to play game give out so much. You’re asking for so much because you won at a game where the only thing you’re meant to do is win the one game mode. If you won 100 weapon parts, you’d be able to get an epic in 4 wins. 
hazaar!
God I can't wait for tf3
EA's damage control already posting and giving gold.
no v-bucks?
You should actually get an apex pack when you win. Or at least a chance of one.
Yeah wins should give you packs
I mean, seems a little light. I did after all download their free game. My time alone is worth something, much less my skill.
Knowing EA it would be more like
You are the champion 
Pay 2.99$ to go to another match
Maybe just an apex pack for winning.
*Provides fun, completely free game*

    Sure but.. let's not front like paid loot boxes aren't inherently predatory.
Okay legit idea: have the end screen say “You are the Apex *Predator*” instead of “You are the Champion”. 

Apex predator is basically the biggest, baddest animal in a certain area so it’d be an oppertunity wasted if they don’t.

Edit: aaaaand apparently the “apex predators” were a group in Titanfall 2, which is why the game is called Apex Legends. Fuck
    The Apex Predators were actually a group of mercs in Titanfall 2. Thats where Apex Legends gets its name afaik 
        Oh, fuck. Welp that’s what I get when I don’t spend money on good games...
            The game is like $5 at this point if you're not having a dirt sandwich for dinner then just buy it
                Damn okay then

Lemme just put away my *gravel* sandwich for later and hop off to the store
                    Look at this fat cat with enough money to make a sandwich out of his gravel
                        You made me laugh, have some silver
    >Apex *Predator*

*Randy Orton reference out of nowhere!*
I'd be down with like 10 apex coins for a win. Just enough motivati ok n for the win where it still feels satisfying.
Pure shitirical post.

A famous Polish satirical, philosophical, and science fiction writer Stanisław Lem said:

*"As long as I did not use the Internet, I did not know that there are so many idiots in the world."*
Definitely came in here like "ugh.. another one of these posts..." high quality shitpost right here.
Finally, someone who gets it. Like, what's even the point in playing a game if it doesn't fire out a little dart filled with dopamine directly into your jugular after every match? 
What the fuck are those rewards?
Fucking anti gamer propaganda.
If i win i should be able to make any girl take my hand in forced marriage.
Fucking hell PROFESIONALS HAVE STANDARDS.
Give me something of value 🤑 for winning a match in a free game. 

Have my upvote, you are entitled to it.
I've never encountered such a "gimmie gimmie" community before. It's crazy how much free stuff everyone thinks they are entitled to in this game. I'm perfectly happy with the way things are now and prices. I threw money at the game and I will again later with the battlepass. Games like 2 weeks old and everyone thinks they should have it all already lol. 
    I think the biggest reason is the number of kids wanting to play another free game since it’s all they have access too. This goes for my 13 year old sister too, her Xbox is on full lockdown so she can only get free stuff. And she would come up and say I wish they had this or that. Just look at the fortnite community, it’s full of requests and suggestions. While some are good, most are just come off as begging or unnecessary, but it’s not like they have other games they can play so why not try changing what they can. Again that’s just my theory, Apex Legends has easily attracted the same age range of kids but we’ll see how long they stick by the fad. 
In all seriousness, a bit more of a reward would be appreciated after a win.
    In all seriousness, give me a fucking break. 
        Rightyo, daddyo.
Proper shitpost m8!
r/unrealistic 
Idk what a Shitpost is doing high in the popular tab. But I’m all for it

    Do you expect a reward for playing a pick up game of basketball at the park? 
I like this suggestion a lot. It would actually make wins mean something, because right now, theres no reason to try and win

I hope ea sees this. Someone make a petition or something!
    [deleted]
        Oh fuck my joke did not land at all

I agreed with OP, and was kinda trying to make fun of them aswell. The idea that like there was no reason to try and win without these super over the top and ridiculous awards. I kinda wanted to play the part of "redditor that agrees with stupid suggestion"

I thought adding the part about the petition would nail home the sarcasm, but i guess i wasnt clear enough. Whoops
            Add a /s for sarcasm or gamble on getting taken seriously
            i got your joke pal idk why you got downvoted 
        Could you seriously not see how sarcastic that comment was?  He even ended it with "someone make a petition or something!".  lmao
    The whole reason to try and win, is the fact that you win.
        Dont take what i said seriously, it was just a failed attempt at a joke :(

I agree with you, i wanted to make that same point by basically saying "yeah, i wont try to win unless you give me these ridiculous, over the top rewards". I realise the sarcasm was really not clear in the way i worded it, so thats my bad 

I thought adding the part about the petition would make the comment just about ludicrous enough to imply the sarcasm, especially in the context of the post, but i was wrong... 
Ah, I LOVE a good anti-jerk thread. Dude, the entitlement of gamers actually pissed me off the past few days. How dare companies try and make money off their games. How dare they!
    I think most are just taking it the wrong way.

Sure you can call them entitled etc.. But look at the giants that have fallen due to "trying to make money"

Getting people to buy more for less would surely be a bigger profit in the end? 
I hate my generation and all of it's entitlement
Someone posted not long ago doing something like Rainbow Six Siege does. Have a spinner that gives you a chance towards an additional Apex pack. 

A win would boost the chance significantly. Like 10-15%

A loss would maybe up the chance like 0.5-1% each time. 
Seems modest enough
I love you for this.
Why not have it remove stuff from your inventory when you win?
whoever picks the titanfall 3 is gonna have a bad time.
Upington. 
i’ll take my opt of Titanfall 3 please
man I just want one V so i can pretend im bored with them haha
You made me laugh, so you made me upvote.
I loled hard, thank you :D
Free battlepass 4ever maybe??? 
Why cabt I get a win for a win?
All I want is some chicken dinner
I’d just like a win
I dunno. Seems too little of a reward tbh 
Must be nice to have winSSSSSSSSSSSSS... I don't even have 1 after 75 hours. 
Quality shitpost
Grade A
I would prefer to get 10% of EA stock for a victory
PETITION SIGNED!
But is a sense of pride and accomplishment enough? 
Its not enough. I want all three options, I don't want to choose. How can anyone be motivated to play this game with just a feeling of a 'sense of accomplishment'. SMH /s
Quality shit post
/s
Everyone gets tf3 for free

Who would want that?
I was kind of just thinking that the game after, you gain invincibility.

I mean then we would atleast have a gain from winning
/s
Damnit, you got me. I thought this was a serious post when I read the title :D
Good shit; possssssst
Once I win I'll let you know 😂😭 
Yeah, that may make me try harder for my first win 😂😂
Damn
Thank you.  I'm at work and didn't have time to do this myself, earlier today.  You are my hero.
Im dead 😂
Bullshit, you mean I have to win 3 times to get all these options?! I want my money back way to cater to the 1% 
Nah, a win gives you a share of EA stock
**t***H*~~iS~~ **d*****O****e****Sn'****T* ***s****At**~~I~~****~~sFy~~*** ***M*****e**
Oh shit you guys have actually won a game?
You just won 
The rewards are a bit broken, just a bit
It would be nice to get some currency to buy stuff for a win, not apex coins.
This is so dumb how will Apex Legends make money. 

Titanfall 3.

/s
I just want some crafting materials.
“Free copy of Titanfall 3” got me lmfao
And I want a toilet made out of solid gold but it's just not in the cards now is it! 
Nah winning is rewarding enough. 
All you people with your wins.

Level 18 0 wins, but I place in the top 5 84% of my games (yeah i've been tracking it, it's my first BR ok)
Making you pick 1 out of 3... typical EA... anything to stop you getting ALL the good stuff!!
Yes
I haven’t had a win yet :( So I would take anything. 
I would enjoy the rainbow 6 free loot system. Would be amazing 
The game is free, give me more free. 
or even better
1e+100 of apex coins
get the powers of your main IRL
free titanfall 3,4,5 copies


Just give each winner a share of EA stock
Can we earn currency if we win atleast or crafting materials? If you guys trying to be original atleast be the first battle royale to reward us with stuff once we win. 
😂😂😂😂😂, good one
How many copies of Titanfall do you need?!
This took me way to long to understand.
I saw the 1,000,000 Apex Coins and was like, "this person is out of their mind", and then saw the Every Legendary Skins option and it all came together. +1
No, I want shares in EA and respawn for wins. It’s only fair
Nice post 
I’ve won about 10 games and although the satisfaction of winning isn’t as intense as a game like PUBG, I can definitely say I enjoy playing the game regardless of if I’m winning. I have a fun time with friends and I think that’s more important than stressing every game about winning in a game like PUBG. 

On the topic of winning rewards - I would not be opposed to some building material, apex coins, or even an apex pack. Even getting a couple building material for doing well in a game that you don’t win in would make the grind feel better than getting an apex pack every other level and eventually less than that.
I wish I was rewarded different things the exp

100% agreed, atleast throw me extra crafting materials to validate the fact i win WAY more games than opppnents so i should be compensated
Hahaha. 
Man I haven't heard of Doom49 in a loong time. I miss him a lot now that I think about it.
The wins in this game are surprisingly unsatisfying. Not that I don’t enjoy winning, but that most of the time i win without realizing it. Like just a series of fights and suddenly the victory splash pops up. Didn’t know they were the last team and the circle was still very big. 
Million Apex Coins, lol. Could you imagine?
That isn’t even a decision.

Anyone who doesn’t take the TF3 can suck my TF-Knee.
I just want proper leaderboards. 🙏
***TITANFALL 3***
Nah, not only Legenday skins, all skins, I feel empty only having those for my wins that I got carried to and dont earn whatsoever
Once I saw bt I already knew which I wanted
Now the cheating will begin. Fire up the hacks boys let's get those wins! 
LOL Can I like this twice?!
I thought it just being Friday was a good enough reason to be alive but this post topped that.  
Suggestion: Make this post happen but also don’t make it happen as it would break the game but also change the entire game but also change nothing. 
I only wish that you got more XP for a win, as it is now literally nothing but time played adds up. Kills revives and wins are only a small amount of XP. 
Yeah you can’t even flex your total number of wins as a banner or anything
I’ll happily pay for a copy of Titanfall 3.
Crafting materials would be a great reward for a win. 
Top quality shitposting right here. I approve!
That would be amazing xD
That would be unfair because he developers would lose money!^/s
Same people that want total kills/wins tracker. 
I'd actually prefer a new GPU so i can run apex on higher settings
Lmfao like I could win
I will say I had my first win today and it was wholly unsatisfying. But that was mostly because the final enemy team died to the zone. Really anti-climatic.
Idiots upvoting this... Literally get nothing for a win, and you guys make fun of it when people point it out.

That kind of behaviour is a signal for a company to increase profit margins. 
Apex packs past level 50 would be nice 
Honestly, at mid-high levels a win really means nothing for progression.   Maybe a win can be a guaranteed level or a half of a level after a certain point?
Top tier post
Shitposts are funny, shitposts taking away from a completely valid point aren’t. The game is good, no reason game dev 101 should be ignored. 
titan fall 3 ofc
Would be fucking awesome if we got like 100 apex coins for winning a game
Honestly, they should at least give us something like 60 scrap for a win. Anything would be better than nothing!
Haha get it? Because people ask for free lootboxes for wins. Fucking poor people lmao just buy them.
Finally a sensible proposal!
Here is the problem it will be satisfying exactly once
r/gamingcirclejerk 
I have 50 wins and I’m not complaining ab it lol people who are, are probably really bad and win one or two times or are broke and want every skin in the game lol
Noice
Ok I haven’t even the foggiest idea what the game is like but this is a quality shitpost. 
Hows about the next game you start with Papa Legion and a free Kraber?
Select? Please, that's barely anything. We need ALL of them
After you get all three they just pay you $50/win
I know this is a shitpost and all, but I think it's an awesome idea to have a pick-a-prize at the end if you win :O
I haven't won a game and only have 3 kills (after playing maybe 7 games), but yesterday the team I was on took out the champions and that felt pretty good.  I also had two people leave my team because I had zero kills (after playing 2 games) and I got to be a one-man squad.  That was kinda fun because it gave me a chance to actually mess around with the controls and figure out what I can do without the stress of having teammates.  

All in all a good day.  
Honestly being the champion squad in the next match is more rewarding than the win for me. 
lmao yeah come on you guys. Everyone wants to be treated like royalty when they win a game. There was a massively upvoted post on this sub suggesting that everyone who wins should get an apex pack. In a free game that anyone can really win on a fluke. 
Can we just get better rewards for winning
For real though, wins haven't felt satisfying for me in this game. It has nothing to do with a lack of reward, the feeling of accomplishment just isn't there. Getting wins in both Fortnite and PUBG felt like an achievement, this game just feels like you won a round of COD or Battlefield 1.
Petition to get EA stock as a reward for every win
Wasn't there a guy who's Apex account got credited with one million coins?

How do you increase your reddit karma?
joke is good, but on a serious note, we need win rewards because soon you won't get any more packs at lvl 100. 


and i ain't spending money on this game unless battlepass is exactly like fortnites

    models up to make them pop out more, just about everything else down to 0.  Vibrancy cranked up in the nvidia control panel to make it look like looney tunes to separate the colors so everything stands out more, brightness and gamma adjusted so there's no dark spots at all.

            What this guy said please and thank you
            Well son, have you ever taken mushrooms?
        That seems really unnecessary, I'd rather keep the game beautiful instead of getting a tiny advantage
    eh you'd be surprised.

The majority of people here might because they care enough to about the game to get decent at it.

But your average player couldn't care less about having the highest framerate possible at all times if they have to sacrifice graphical quality for it.
         lowering quality does not nessicarily increase preformance.
            Specially on this modded source thing they have goin on.

Its primarily for visibility purposes.

I personally think it's pretty stupid unless you are a pro.

I didn't pay a thousand bucks on a graphics card just to put everything on low for some minimal visibility advantage. 
        I might have to disagree, the average player would have a worse PC than people who are more 'hardcore' so they'd turn it down anyway. And the guys who care about fps would also turn settings down.

It's a weird world lol

                        Aw man he’s been my favorite author all my life. Damn it 😂🤦🏻‍♂️

                        I guess I was young enough to not pick up on it back then
                    We're talking comparing Obama to Hitler and saying that his political "goal" would be to lock up all homosexuals crazy. 
                It's a little funny how he writes incredibly understand and empathetic characters - I genuinely can't imagine any of them except some of the obvious villains like bonzo even potentially being homophobic, or something - but he himself seems to not be that way

Ah yes, it's **X**enocide. It's been many years since I read the series.
                Xeno means relating to a foreigner or foreigners.

As in "xenophobia".


I know this whole thing is a meme but 

> The talent would funnel upwards, which each game being filled with progressively better and better players,

This would actually be a very cool tournament system. Imagine, winning a game grants you a 'Challenger Token - Tier 1'. Spend this token to queue into a game with only other Tier 1 challengers. The winner of that game gets a Tier 2 token, everyone else goes back to the bottom. 

By Tier 5, 3.2 million champions would be concentrated down to just one single, true, Apex Legend. 
    A single Apex Legend, or... an Apex Predator?
        Earn your right to play Titanfall 3. If you cant even beat some random mook legends, how you gon play TF|3 and be a pilot amirite. 
            Please delete your comment. I'm scared that Respawn will see it, make it a reality, and then I'll never get to play Titanfall 3.
            Yeah, like who the fuck gets killed by a MRVN. I'm sure pilots regard this tournament like pro MMA fighters see karate classes. 
        Instead of “you are the champion” you get “you are the apex legend”
    I mean that's kinda what ranking systems are supposed to do, except you don't go to zero rank every time you lose.
        Yeah but this sounds cool and that’s all that matters
            I’ve already got my forum post draft written up for this system. I’m ready to complain about it being too hard and not letting me win yet.
        Ranking system is good for continuous play. This idea was more of an event focus. Each season has a Champion Series where the most successful players can fight there way to the final Champion Tier, getting them a spot into a publicized Championship game for prize money. I just think it would so cool to enable 'nobody' players to make a name for themselves in the game by literally fighting their way to the top.

The big issue with this is of course greater incentive to cheat.. but I hope that due to the final few tiers having much fewer players, it would be viable to ween any cheaters out of the final Tier championship.
            The bigger issue with this is getting enough people with tier 3 and above tokens to play at the same time
                I outlined a bit in another comment. Tiers above 1-2 would have a schedule of dedicated match times to consolidate enough players at once. 
    [deleted]
        Fortnite just started a tournament system that's loosely this idea. Only a top percent gets invited to the next one and so on. It JUST started though so we'll have to wait to see if it's dope as hell
    Except probably by Tier 2 queue times would take forever so they'd probably have to have some way to remedy that, like maybe making Tier 2+ games occur at a specific time every week like Dota 2's battle cup that happens every saturday night.
        Yea this is very true. My napkin idea would be to have a pre-designated schedule of matches for each Tier. The schedule would rotate over time so if your Tier game is at 4am you can wait a few days and get into one at a more reasonable time. This champion series would run over the course of an entire season to give everyone ample time to compete. 
Well played, Orson Scott Card's famous son, Ender Peter Valentine Card.
I 100% know nothing about Titanfall Lore and thought that they had stolen the name "formics" for a second. 
I actually would love an event like that! 
    Boy, do I have a book for you!
        Books! There is a whole series, but most people just stop with Ender's Game. The sequels to Ender's Game get very political/religious/allegorical so I can see why people didn't like them as much. Still a good read.  
            It's why there's so much falloff. After Ender's Game/Shadow, the books become radically different
                With speaker for the dead being the best one of them all!
                    Oh not to knock the books at all, read through the series multiple times, favorite books! I just understand why someone would pick up the second book and be confused. In middle school I put it down
                        Agreed, 14 yr old me had no idea what was going on, or what was being referenced. Still trudged through them. 25 yr old me is now enlightened.
                        I read Speaker first, really enjoyed it, and then went to Game for context.
                            That... Must have been pretty confusing. Interesting order.

Also, MAJOR spoilers. That pretty much ruins book 1.
            I liked the bean series a lot more than the sequels to the Ender series.
            Yea I’ve read em all.  I’m a fan.
            I actually prefer the second book. For rereading anyway.

This is definitely one of the most reasonable suggestions I’ve seen regarding the packs. 
    But we dont even know what upcoming Battlepass entails lol. We dont have any sort of full understanding of what the rewards are going to be like for progressing. They may be nothing, or it may be great. I think suggestions about what to add are kind of silly when we dont even know what's about to be added with the Battlepass.
        THIS is definitely the most reasonable thing to think. The game has been out for less than two weeks. I hate how fast this sub has fallen into “Make this skin for this character” and “We should get this for winning.” Patience is a virtue people.
            These must all be done by people who don't have the crashing issue, cause that's the only thing I want right now.  I'll worry about cosmetics and loot when I can consistently play the game.
                I hear you.  My friend and I have finally gotten to a place where we can play with maybe one crash per day of gaming.  

The fixes seem to be so different for everyone which is frustrating.  

The EasyAntiCheat force service to restart on failure seems to have done it for me (along with a clean Origin reinstall).  Played about 4 hours yesterday with just one crash.  Of course, I also toned down my vid mem usage, set VSync to dynamic, and a bunch of other voodoo...so hard to say what really fixed it.
                    Yeah, the huge list of "fixes" I keep seeing is rough, and then there's people going "I did every fix listed and it's still happening" that's real disheartening.
                    Over only had it crash when I maxed the video settings at 4K but had super sampling turned on. 1440P gets a consistent frame rates without the periodic crashes so I'll leave it at that for now.
                I’ve been playing on console and don’t have the crashing issue for the most part, but even so I’m enjoying the game as is right now. One of the reasons FortNite has stayed fresh for people is thanks to the seasons and staggered updates and additions. I’d like to see this game last a long time so I’m happy to let the devs move at their own pace.
                Been having the *DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_HUNG* error crash intermittently since release, with 6+ in one night once, and just once in several hours of play the other night, but last night got two CTDs with no error (like many people have been describing) for the first time.

Was hoping I was lucky to have crashes with actual traceable error messages so they'd hopefully get fixed, but now I guess I'm in the same "hope they can get lucky and figure it out" boat as so many others. :/
                I’ve been playing on and off for the past week on PC and don’t have any issues. I’m running an i7-6700k, GTX 1070 and 12g Ram using Windows 10 Home. I have a 60hz monitor though. I’ve heard limiting frame rates could help prevent crashes. 
            Honestly the only change I ask get made as soon as possible is allowing people to reconnect when they get disconnected. Sucks when your squad is doing really well and someone's internet goes out or the game crashes for just a few moments but they're not able to rejoin that match. Just have the character stand still until they reconnect in a certain time frame.
                Especially because if they dc and you win , it doesn’t count . The only win tracker is “wins with full squad” and it only counts as a win if you have a full squad . 
                I wholeheartedly agree. I got extremely salty last night because of a disconnect. I hotdropped with my friend, got 6 kills, set up with a fully kitted longbow and r-301 (two of my favorite guns) and purple shields. It was one of the best starts to a game I've ever had. As we were running to steal a care package, my game crashed and I lost everything. Nearly ruined my night, I was so mad.

If they fixed the crashes, or if I could simply reconnect, I might have won that game. Instead my friend quit and we queued up for another and didn't win for another 4 games or so.
            Seriously.

Am I the only one that's like "hey this free game is alright let's see where it goes"
            All I see is

"We want apex to be fortnite but not fortnite, thx"
                Not at all. I don’t play FortNite, but its hard to argue its success over the past year. If this game wants to have long-term success it definitely wouldn’t hurt to take inspiration from how FortNite released its content. That doesn’t mean it needs to have the same content.
                    I mean't overall from all of the other comments, not you specifically.

Since this was set as a FTP game all of the kids in fortnite jumped over and now expect fornite shit when that's just not gonna happen. 

Comments like, "Whens the pony skin coming" shit like that.
                        Ah I see now. Yeah that I definitely agree with. Unfortunately that seems to always happen on game subs the more popular the game becomes.
            I'm just thinking it must be great to have so much time to play video games you're already so advanced in this game you've gotten all the free stuff and are no longer satisfied with the free game. 
        I halfway agree, but crates are pretty wimpy imo so allowing one per day which most people won’t get everyday is just a decent little carrot on a stick
        But still you get about the same amount of xp for winning as you do for surviving for a long period of time
    I actually think that's a crazy idea and will never be a reality.

You could earn 100 pounds worth of apex packs in 3 months. Ea won't let that fly. A few crafting materials for wins sure. But an apex for a win? Will never happen. 
        I see your point regarding the potential to earn that many cosmetic items if you were to win a match every day. However, I’m willing to bet the vast majority of players don’t win a match everyday but I could be wrong! 
            And the ones who do are usually streamers and such who already spend TONS on the game and will make their viewers feel like its WAY easier to get the packs than it really is, causing many to become frustrated and just straight up buy the packs since they can't win enough games to keep all the skins like (insert streamer).
                The people who win aren't streamers it's people who are good at the game not "usually streamers".

There were 10 *MILLION* players, and 1 *MILLION* Consistent players. You really think even 100 streamers winning is the issue?
    I kinda just want like 25 - 100 of those little red coins when a game ends...
    I don't think it's reasonable at all to suggest getting something free in a already free game especially when the something free is 100% trivial and has no game impact
I think they are going to wait for the battlepass before making any changes to the rewards system.  It's EA, they constantly monitor the spending and receiving of every currency type, what people are buying with apex coins, etc.
That would mean you get a free equivalent to a dollar every day. Granted, lootboxes are pretty overpriced, but I bet ea would only allow that every few days (2 - 7) or maybe just give a handful of legend tokens.
    Is winning really this easy for you people damn
        Nope, I've won twice. Just saying you're bound to win if you play enough and get some very capable teammates.
            The amount of people who would win every single day just through sheer number of games played is a very small amount of the player-base.

The amount of people who will win every day out of playing like 2 or 3 games per day is also a very small amount of the player-base.

There's not much reason for them to worry about not having anyone to whom to sell boxes when those groups make up such a small part.
                Your team just needs to drop in a low population area. Your chances will increase dramatically.
        I'm trash, but im almost always top 3 because I kind of know my way around the map enough to not die. As soon as my only choice is fighting im screwed though lol
            Same here. We should go to group therapy 
                Nah just do what I do and constantly boast to your teammates about your superior "geographical battleground awareness" ^(and then get carried to a win)
        I'd say I usually get a win a day and I play about six matches on average. My win rate is substantially more likely if I have a team that all use mics. The ping system is fantastic but some intricate details still can't be conveyed by a singular ping. 
        Depends on your squad, with random I can usually win 1in3 matches or so. But with my usual squad we win about 80% of our games. In our usual 4-5 hour nightly sessions our minimum wins has been 10 per session since release.
            Jesus you’re good 
        Easy? No. Frequent? Eh, kinda. If I’m playing with my friends I can usually get a win or two a day guaranteed. We had about 5 wins on a 3hr session a few days ago. 
        I've won 20 games in 80 tries. My one friend who is wayyyy too good at this shit has about 35 in 85. 
    So the people who are really good at it would get $365 worth per year. That would be a pretty big opportunity cost. 
        Well if you ever had a trash freemium app, dailies are their bread and butter. It means you have to log in everyday. If youre a cheap bastard it doesnt mean much but on a large scale they probably profit from it.
    This isn't ever a valid argument. Just because the lootboxes cost $1 does not mean they are worth $1. To produce an apex lootbox cost the devs next to nothing, they could create 10 trillion. I could make a game and charge $100 a lootbox and give 1 free to every player every day just for logging in. That does not mean the players are getting $100 worth of value (before or after opening).

I get they can't just give everything away. But don't try to equate some arbitrary price they made for a random gambling lootbox (where they also create the winning odds) to a value in the real world just because they are giving it away for free. They are not giving away a dollars worth of value to me. I can not trade apex packs for anything of value in the real world.
        Yeah what you’re not accounting for is potential lost revenue in the form of those “free boxes”. I’m sure if this was implemented, the CFO over at EA would calculate every free loot box that was given away, and he’d have a stroke after realizing all the money the company could have had. 
        when they're pricing individual legendaries at 11 to 18 dollars, probably no matter what comes out of the box the total is worth $1+ in equivalence. 
    [deleted]
I would be fine with a pack per win per week. Maybe a challenge for time played in the week. 2 crates a week. 

1 crate a day is honestly a lot for these types of games I feel, especially with no dupes and a 7.5% chance to get a legendary. We also haven't got our battle pass yet.

At this point I would take anything because after level 50 you only get 1 crate every 4 levels. 72,000 xp=one crate.
Or go the Overwatch Arcade route and have 1 pack per 3 games won, up to a maximum of 3 packs for 9 games won per week.
How about 1 thing instead of a pack
Not in this thread you entitled gamer. Its a free game you'll owe the devs for the rest of your life for merely looking at the game and not paying them anything /s
Sex is cool, but have you won a round of Apex after your teammates dipped at the beginning?
Rewards should be real life currency, bitcoin, or vbucks 
    Lmao I’ll send you 2000 vbucks for the joke
        Do you need my credit card number, the expiration date and the three wacky numbers on the back? 
For real my dude. That's all that matters. 
I know im going to sound like an annoying ass boomer, but it really is the new generation of gamers that complain about not enough rewards. I remember playing the OG cod's and halo's for the pure fun of the game for hundreds of hours. This games been out a single week and people are asking for more rewards as if thats the sole reason to play a game. 
    its because these games are designed to tease you with cosmetics and then make them really hard to get , unless you pay money, 

if the cosmetics were never in the game ppl wouldnt be asking for them
        It comes down to not being a bitch.

Somewhere, a psychologist, an economist, and a game developer sat in a room devising how to turn  the players into their bitch and make you feel compelled to buy shiny stuff.

They are betting people can't help themselves - show them better, or accept the fact that they won.
            i've never bought microtransations, (apart from 10 euro on overwatch over 1500 hrs played)

was just explaining to the guy above me why people want more rewards - so they can get the carrot on the stick thats been put in front of them
        The other thing they should do is to just have a set of cosmetics attainable through achievements, like some of the badges are now.

I guess they don't want to as it would 'devalue the premium cosmetics' but I remember back in uncharted 2 when people had skins for reaching super high ranks, you got one for a certain number of kills in a game etc.

You could add in a skin for each character if that player has done certain achievements in titanfall 2 and possibly get players interested in that too (like GW2 does with some GW1 achievements).

The badges are cool and all, and tbh I have much more respect for a player with one of the harder to get badges than I ever would for a legendary skin, but they're still pretty subtle (unless you happen to be the champions).
    That's the result of freemium game gambling addiction. Not that this game isn't fun, but you shouldn't be confused as to why people ask for rewards and get greedy so quickly when that is what devs have been selling them for the better part of 3 years now. 
Amen
Same, except instead of the let's gooooo I say "thanks for the carry" then slink back to menu 
I think for a lot of people (myself included) it's less about wanting a reward and more just wanting an incentive. Even if it's an astronomically small one, at least I'd have a reason to come back. I usually find that once I've played the game a few times and got a win, there's no further reason to come back, nothing to work towards, and I stop playing after a week tops. This is why the battlepass in fortnite works, but currently there's no incentive to stay with this game.
r/apexlegendscirclejerk
This would actually be cool to go with the celebrity  competition theme.
Don’t say that :( 
    Ya I hope not too🤞 just making a joke 😁
        Haha all good bro I really hope they choose to make a titanfall 3, I love the series so much 
            I've actually never been a fan of BRs... but its the "Titanfall style" that is incorporated in this game that makes it so awesome imo.

I played Titanfall 2 and love it too (never played original), and its awesome to see them "evolve" their games.
                Yeah definitely, having so many hours in titanfall 2, Apex felt like second nature as soon as I started playing. I have actually been a fan of BRS since playing them but Apex is my favourite 
                    One thing I noticed was the movement came super naturally to me. Jumping, sliding, wall climbing all felt familiar a few games in.
                        The only thing I *think* is different is that sprinting doesn't take you out of (toggle) ads. I feel like that was a thing in Titanfall and while I'm not sure, I've definitely died a few times because I thought I was
                            Maybe because sprint button is also the scope zoom toggle button, by default? Not sure if it'd change if you were to unbind the zoom toggle button. 
                            I feel like it was too, and if it wasn't Titanfall it's definitely like that in most other FPSs.
                Yeah the combat in other BRs always felt off for me, I was awful at it compared to other shooters. I'm used to playing Titanfall so that transition felt so much more natural
            I thought they already said tf3 was canceled?
                They did
            This exchange is too wholesome and positive for a shitpost, someone talk shit quick.
    They said they're releasing another full game in the Titanfall universe later this year at least. Maybe Titanfall 3, maybe something else.
Haha oh god it hurts so much
    Not as much as it hurt Respawn to make the best shooter of the year and have no one play it.
        Further proving the importance of good marketing

# SHUT YOUR FILTHY MOUTH
Don't say that ...ever.
Apex is very clearly PilotFall
    Except no pilots? 
Fill me in, I don't play a lot of battle royales, is a prize for winning just not a thing? Personally I think it could make people more cautious and hidey which I find very boring.
    You get more experience for surviving longer, so winning gives you more experience in that sense.

Edit: you also get a bonus 900exp for winning. 

Everyone likes to scream entitled but money has nothing to do with it for a lot of people. Some people just want a sort of progression/reward system.

The more you level up the less loot boxes you get too. So that, combined with no extra prizes for winning is pretty disappointing for a lot of people. 
        There hasn’t been a battle royale where you get prizes for winning. Why are people all of a sudden surprised a F2P game doesn’t have them..? 
            Maybe not but I've seen people ask for it plenty of times. 

Would always see posts or r/pubatlegorunds asking for something for winning a match.
                you get a lot more BP in pubg when you win. I. Apex I get 4500xp for just being a live to the end the 900xp is fine but it feels so little comped to just being a live. 
        It's not just for survival time, you also get a 900xp bonus for winning.
    There arent a whole lot of multiplayer games in general that give you cosmetics/loot just for winning a match. Overwatch is a full price game that uses the same reward system as Apex. 
    It's not a Battle Royale thing, you do get stuff, you get get extra experience for winning and placing high. This is more an issue of people not being satisfied that a free to play game isn't giving them enough loot and they're scrounging for ways to get more for free. The entitelement is fucking thick. We get the most polished and amazing BR game in existence for free which still gives you a ton of free skins and yet people are crying that it's not enough.
        [deleted]
        H1Z1, the first big battle royale, gave out in game items. Theres no fucking entitlement lmao. It's so much more rewarding to actually get a reward than EXP.
Crazy that ***not everyone agrees with your opinion.***
    Everyone wants free shit.

***Not everyone feels entitled to it just because they play a FREE game.***
        I just want more exp for winning than I get for surviving 5 minutes.
            Unless you are ending games as the victor in 5 minutes then you are earning more XP when you win.  Especially when you get the 500 champion XP the next round you play.  

Because people aren't asking for shit that is going to bankrupt respawn and EA. If you earn just 10 crafting material per win, it takes 120 wins to get any legendary. I bet 90% of the people here won't even see 120 total wins in 1000 hours. 
Yes I have only won once and my 11 year old son was a big part of that 
I just had my first win in about a 100 games as well, most of them ending within 5 minutes.

Carried my squad of rando's. GF next to me on the couch with that look on her face only GF's can have watching their loved one acting like a 5 year old jumping on the couch, fist pumping and chanting YES YES YES LETS GO BOYS. 

So yeah, rewarding enough. On to the next 100 games.
    "And this is how I spend valentine's day..."
    Lucky. My wife won't even watch me for 15 seconds lol. 
and most of the skins are nothing special
Hold up
Sure but.. let's not front like paid loot boxes aren't inherently predatory.
The Apex Predators were actually a group of mercs in Titanfall 2. Thats where Apex Legends gets its name afaik 
    Oh, fuck. Welp that’s what I get when I don’t spend money on good games...
        The game is like $5 at this point if you're not having a dirt sandwich for dinner then just buy it
            Damn okay then

Lemme just put away my *gravel* sandwich for later and hop off to the store
                Look at this fat cat with enough money to make a sandwich out of his gravel
                    You made me laugh, have some silver
>Apex *Predator*

*Randy Orton reference out of nowhere!*
> Being fluent in sarcasm as well, I support your post. 

Wowww. How did you catch it?

&#x200B;
I think the biggest reason is the number of kids wanting to play another free game since it’s all they have access too. This goes for my 13 year old sister too, her Xbox is on full lockdown so she can only get free stuff. And she would come up and say I wish they had this or that. Just look at the fortnite community, it’s full of requests and suggestions. While some are good, most are just come off as begging or unnecessary, but it’s not like they have other games they can play so why not try changing what they can. Again that’s just my theory, Apex Legends has easily attracted the same age range of kids but we’ll see how long they stick by the fad. 
In all seriousness, give me a fucking break. 
    Rightyo, daddyo.

    Oh fuck my joke did not land at all

I agreed with OP, and was kinda trying to make fun of them aswell. The idea that like there was no reason to try and win without these super over the top and ridiculous awards. I kinda wanted to play the part of "redditor that agrees with stupid suggestion"

I thought adding the part about the petition would nail home the sarcasm, but i guess i wasnt clear enough. Whoops
        Add a /s for sarcasm or gamble on getting taken seriously
        i got your joke pal idk why you got downvoted 
    Could you seriously not see how sarcastic that comment was?  He even ended it with "someone make a petition or something!".  lmao
The whole reason to try and win, is the fact that you win.
    Dont take what i said seriously, it was just a failed attempt at a joke :(

I agree with you, i wanted to make that same point by basically saying "yeah, i wont try to win unless you give me these ridiculous, over the top rewards". I realise the sarcasm was really not clear in the way i worded it, so thats my bad 

I thought adding the part about the petition would make the comment just about ludicrous enough to imply the sarcasm, especially in the context of the post, but i was wrong... 
I think most are just taking it the wrong way.

Sure you can call them entitled etc.. But look at the giants that have fallen due to "trying to make money"

Getting people to buy more for less would surely be a bigger profit in the end?

    That seems really unnecessary, I'd rather keep the game beautiful instead of getting a tiny advantage
eh you'd be surprised.

The majority of people here might because they care enough to about the game to get decent at it.

But your average player couldn't care less about having the highest framerate possible at all times if they have to sacrifice graphical quality for it.
     lowering quality does not nessicarily increase preformance.
        Specially on this modded source thing they have goin on.

Its primarily for visibility purposes.

I personally think it's pretty stupid unless you are a pro.

I didn't pay a thousand bucks on a graphics card just to put everything on low for some minimal visibility advantage. 
    I might have to disagree, the average player would have a worse PC than people who are more 'hardcore' so they'd turn it down anyway. And the guys who care about fps would also turn settings down.

It's a weird world lol

A single Apex Legend, or... an Apex Predator?
    Earn your right to play Titanfall 3. If you cant even beat some random mook legends, how you gon play TF|3 and be a pilot amirite. 
        Please delete your comment. I'm scared that Respawn will see it, make it a reality, and then I'll never get to play Titanfall 3.
        Yeah, like who the fuck gets killed by a MRVN. I'm sure pilots regard this tournament like pro MMA fighters see karate classes. 
    Instead of “you are the champion” you get “you are the apex legend”
I mean that's kinda what ranking systems are supposed to do, except you don't go to zero rank every time you lose.
    Yeah but this sounds cool and that’s all that matters
        I’ve already got my forum post draft written up for this system. I’m ready to complain about it being too hard and not letting me win yet.
    Ranking system is good for continuous play. This idea was more of an event focus. Each season has a Champion Series where the most successful players can fight there way to the final Champion Tier, getting them a spot into a publicized Championship game for prize money. I just think it would so cool to enable 'nobody' players to make a name for themselves in the game by literally fighting their way to the top.

The big issue with this is of course greater incentive to cheat.. but I hope that due to the final few tiers having much fewer players, it would be viable to ween any cheaters out of the final Tier championship.
        The bigger issue with this is getting enough people with tier 3 and above tokens to play at the same time
            I outlined a bit in another comment. Tiers above 1-2 would have a schedule of dedicated match times to consolidate enough players at once. 
[deleted]
    Fortnite just started a tournament system that's loosely this idea. Only a top percent gets invited to the next one and so on. It JUST started though so we'll have to wait to see if it's dope as hell
Except probably by Tier 2 queue times would take forever so they'd probably have to have some way to remedy that, like maybe making Tier 2+ games occur at a specific time every week like Dota 2's battle cup that happens every saturday night.
    Yea this is very true. My napkin idea would be to have a pre-designated schedule of matches for each Tier. The schedule would rotate over time so if your Tier game is at 4am you can wait a few days and get into one at a more reasonable time. This champion series would run over the course of an entire season to give everyone ample time to compete. 
Boy, do I have a book for you!
    Books! There is a whole series, but most people just stop with Ender's Game. The sequels to Ender's Game get very political/religious/allegorical so I can see why people didn't like them as much. Still a good read.  
        It's why there's so much falloff. After Ender's Game/Shadow, the books become radically different
            With speaker for the dead being the best one of them all!
                Oh not to knock the books at all, read through the series multiple times, favorite books! I just understand why someone would pick up the second book and be confused. In middle school I put it down
                    Agreed, 14 yr old me had no idea what was going on, or what was being referenced. Still trudged through them. 25 yr old me is now enlightened.
                    I read Speaker first, really enjoyed it, and then went to Game for context.
                        That... Must have been pretty confusing. Interesting order.

Also, MAJOR spoilers. That pretty much ruins book 1.
        I liked the bean series a lot more than the sequels to the Ender series.
        Yea I’ve read em all.  I’m a fan.
        I actually prefer the second book. For rereading anyway.

Apex was *way* better when it was a 2D MMO about wizards.
    I still prefer the realistic dragon mmorpg. 
Thank You!

The voice of reason has finally arrived. 
Shroud owns all of EA after 2 months
But we dont even know what upcoming Battlepass entails lol. We dont have any sort of full understanding of what the rewards are going to be like for progressing. They may be nothing, or it may be great. I think suggestions about what to add are kind of silly when we dont even know what's about to be added with the Battlepass.
    THIS is definitely the most reasonable thing to think. The game has been out for less than two weeks. I hate how fast this sub has fallen into “Make this skin for this character” and “We should get this for winning.” Patience is a virtue people.
        These must all be done by people who don't have the crashing issue, cause that's the only thing I want right now.  I'll worry about cosmetics and loot when I can consistently play the game.
            I hear you.  My friend and I have finally gotten to a place where we can play with maybe one crash per day of gaming.  

The fixes seem to be so different for everyone which is frustrating.  

The EasyAntiCheat force service to restart on failure seems to have done it for me (along with a clean Origin reinstall).  Played about 4 hours yesterday with just one crash.  Of course, I also toned down my vid mem usage, set VSync to dynamic, and a bunch of other voodoo...so hard to say what really fixed it.
                Yeah, the huge list of "fixes" I keep seeing is rough, and then there's people going "I did every fix listed and it's still happening" that's real disheartening.
                Over only had it crash when I maxed the video settings at 4K but had super sampling turned on. 1440P gets a consistent frame rates without the periodic crashes so I'll leave it at that for now.
            I’ve been playing on console and don’t have the crashing issue for the most part, but even so I’m enjoying the game as is right now. One of the reasons FortNite has stayed fresh for people is thanks to the seasons and staggered updates and additions. I’d like to see this game last a long time so I’m happy to let the devs move at their own pace.
            Been having the *DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_HUNG* error crash intermittently since release, with 6+ in one night once, and just once in several hours of play the other night, but last night got two CTDs with no error (like many people have been describing) for the first time.

Was hoping I was lucky to have crashes with actual traceable error messages so they'd hopefully get fixed, but now I guess I'm in the same "hope they can get lucky and figure it out" boat as so many others. :/
            I’ve been playing on and off for the past week on PC and don’t have any issues. I’m running an i7-6700k, GTX 1070 and 12g Ram using Windows 10 Home. I have a 60hz monitor though. I’ve heard limiting frame rates could help prevent crashes. 
        Honestly the only change I ask get made as soon as possible is allowing people to reconnect when they get disconnected. Sucks when your squad is doing really well and someone's internet goes out or the game crashes for just a few moments but they're not able to rejoin that match. Just have the character stand still until they reconnect in a certain time frame.
            Especially because if they dc and you win , it doesn’t count . The only win tracker is “wins with full squad” and it only counts as a win if you have a full squad . 
            I wholeheartedly agree. I got extremely salty last night because of a disconnect. I hotdropped with my friend, got 6 kills, set up with a fully kitted longbow and r-301 (two of my favorite guns) and purple shields. It was one of the best starts to a game I've ever had. As we were running to steal a care package, my game crashed and I lost everything. Nearly ruined my night, I was so mad.

If they fixed the crashes, or if I could simply reconnect, I might have won that game. Instead my friend quit and we queued up for another and didn't win for another 4 games or so.
        Seriously.

Am I the only one that's like "hey this free game is alright let's see where it goes"
        All I see is

"We want apex to be fortnite but not fortnite, thx"
            Not at all. I don’t play FortNite, but its hard to argue its success over the past year. If this game wants to have long-term success it definitely wouldn’t hurt to take inspiration from how FortNite released its content. That doesn’t mean it needs to have the same content.
                I mean't overall from all of the other comments, not you specifically.

Since this was set as a FTP game all of the kids in fortnite jumped over and now expect fornite shit when that's just not gonna happen. 

Comments like, "Whens the pony skin coming" shit like that.
                    Ah I see now. Yeah that I definitely agree with. Unfortunately that seems to always happen on game subs the more popular the game becomes.
        I'm just thinking it must be great to have so much time to play video games you're already so advanced in this game you've gotten all the free stuff and are no longer satisfied with the free game. 
    I halfway agree, but crates are pretty wimpy imo so allowing one per day which most people won’t get everyday is just a decent little carrot on a stick
    But still you get about the same amount of xp for winning as you do for surviving for a long period of time
I actually think that's a crazy idea and will never be a reality.

You could earn 100 pounds worth of apex packs in 3 months. Ea won't let that fly. A few crafting materials for wins sure. But an apex for a win? Will never happen. 
    I see your point regarding the potential to earn that many cosmetic items if you were to win a match every day. However, I’m willing to bet the vast majority of players don’t win a match everyday but I could be wrong! 
        And the ones who do are usually streamers and such who already spend TONS on the game and will make their viewers feel like its WAY easier to get the packs than it really is, causing many to become frustrated and just straight up buy the packs since they can't win enough games to keep all the skins like (insert streamer).
            The people who win aren't streamers it's people who are good at the game not "usually streamers".

There were 10 *MILLION* players, and 1 *MILLION* Consistent players. You really think even 100 streamers winning is the issue?
I kinda just want like 25 - 100 of those little red coins when a game ends...
I don't think it's reasonable at all to suggest getting something free in a already free game especially when the something free is 100% trivial and has no game impact
Is winning really this easy for you people damn
    Nope, I've won twice. Just saying you're bound to win if you play enough and get some very capable teammates.
        The amount of people who would win every single day just through sheer number of games played is a very small amount of the player-base.

The amount of people who will win every day out of playing like 2 or 3 games per day is also a very small amount of the player-base.

There's not much reason for them to worry about not having anyone to whom to sell boxes when those groups make up such a small part.
            Your team just needs to drop in a low population area. Your chances will increase dramatically.
    I'm trash, but im almost always top 3 because I kind of know my way around the map enough to not die. As soon as my only choice is fighting im screwed though lol
        Same here. We should go to group therapy 
            Nah just do what I do and constantly boast to your teammates about your superior "geographical battleground awareness" ^(and then get carried to a win)
    I'd say I usually get a win a day and I play about six matches on average. My win rate is substantially more likely if I have a team that all use mics. The ping system is fantastic but some intricate details still can't be conveyed by a singular ping. 
    Depends on your squad, with random I can usually win 1in3 matches or so. But with my usual squad we win about 80% of our games. In our usual 4-5 hour nightly sessions our minimum wins has been 10 per session since release.
        Jesus you’re good 
    Easy? No. Frequent? Eh, kinda. If I’m playing with my friends I can usually get a win or two a day guaranteed. We had about 5 wins on a 3hr session a few days ago. 
    I've won 20 games in 80 tries. My one friend who is wayyyy too good at this shit has about 35 in 85. 
So the people who are really good at it would get $365 worth per year. That would be a pretty big opportunity cost. 
    Well if you ever had a trash freemium app, dailies are their bread and butter. It means you have to log in everyday. If youre a cheap bastard it doesnt mean much but on a large scale they probably profit from it.
This isn't ever a valid argument. Just because the lootboxes cost $1 does not mean they are worth $1. To produce an apex lootbox cost the devs next to nothing, they could create 10 trillion. I could make a game and charge $100 a lootbox and give 1 free to every player every day just for logging in. That does not mean the players are getting $100 worth of value (before or after opening).

I get they can't just give everything away. But don't try to equate some arbitrary price they made for a random gambling lootbox (where they also create the winning odds) to a value in the real world just because they are giving it away for free. They are not giving away a dollars worth of value to me. I can not trade apex packs for anything of value in the real world.
    Yeah what you’re not accounting for is potential lost revenue in the form of those “free boxes”. I’m sure if this was implemented, the CFO over at EA would calculate every free loot box that was given away, and he’d have a stroke after realizing all the money the company could have had. 
    when they're pricing individual legendaries at 11 to 18 dollars, probably no matter what comes out of the box the total is worth $1+ in equivalence.

Lmao I’ll send you 2000 vbucks for the joke
    Do you need my credit card number, the expiration date and the three wacky numbers on the back? 
its because these games are designed to tease you with cosmetics and then make them really hard to get , unless you pay money, 

if the cosmetics were never in the game ppl wouldnt be asking for them
    It comes down to not being a bitch.

Somewhere, a psychologist, an economist, and a game developer sat in a room devising how to turn  the players into their bitch and make you feel compelled to buy shiny stuff.

They are betting people can't help themselves - show them better, or accept the fact that they won.
        i've never bought microtransations, (apart from 10 euro on overwatch over 1500 hrs played)

was just explaining to the guy above me why people want more rewards - so they can get the carrot on the stick thats been put in front of them
    The other thing they should do is to just have a set of cosmetics attainable through achievements, like some of the badges are now.

I guess they don't want to as it would 'devalue the premium cosmetics' but I remember back in uncharted 2 when people had skins for reaching super high ranks, you got one for a certain number of kills in a game etc.

You could add in a skin for each character if that player has done certain achievements in titanfall 2 and possibly get players interested in that too (like GW2 does with some GW1 achievements).

The badges are cool and all, and tbh I have much more respect for a player with one of the harder to get badges than I ever would for a legendary skin, but they're still pretty subtle (unless you happen to be the champions).
That's the result of freemium game gambling addiction. Not that this game isn't fun, but you shouldn't be confused as to why people ask for rewards and get greedy so quickly when that is what devs have been selling them for the better part of 3 years now. 
Ya I hope not too🤞 just making a joke 😁
    Haha all good bro I really hope they choose to make a titanfall 3, I love the series so much 
        I've actually never been a fan of BRs... but its the "Titanfall style" that is incorporated in this game that makes it so awesome imo.

I played Titanfall 2 and love it too (never played original), and its awesome to see them "evolve" their games.
            Yeah definitely, having so many hours in titanfall 2, Apex felt like second nature as soon as I started playing. I have actually been a fan of BRS since playing them but Apex is my favourite 
                One thing I noticed was the movement came super naturally to me. Jumping, sliding, wall climbing all felt familiar a few games in.
                    The only thing I *think* is different is that sprinting doesn't take you out of (toggle) ads. I feel like that was a thing in Titanfall and while I'm not sure, I've definitely died a few times because I thought I was
                        Maybe because sprint button is also the scope zoom toggle button, by default? Not sure if it'd change if you were to unbind the zoom toggle button. 
                        I feel like it was too, and if it wasn't Titanfall it's definitely like that in most other FPSs.
            Yeah the combat in other BRs always felt off for me, I was awful at it compared to other shooters. I'm used to playing Titanfall so that transition felt so much more natural
        I thought they already said tf3 was canceled?
            They did
        This exchange is too wholesome and positive for a shitpost, someone talk shit quick.
They said they're releasing another full game in the Titanfall universe later this year at least. Maybe Titanfall 3, maybe something else.
Not as much as it hurt Respawn to make the best shooter of the year and have no one play it.
    Further proving the importance of good marketing
    I miss my Tone. God did she piss people off before her Nerf.
        The urge to downvote was strong
Hurts so good!
Except no pilots? 
You get more experience for surviving longer, so winning gives you more experience in that sense.

Edit: you also get a bonus 900exp for winning. 

Everyone likes to scream entitled but money has nothing to do with it for a lot of people. Some people just want a sort of progression/reward system.

The more you level up the less loot boxes you get too. So that, combined with no extra prizes for winning is pretty disappointing for a lot of people. 
    There hasn’t been a battle royale where you get prizes for winning. Why are people all of a sudden surprised a F2P game doesn’t have them..? 
        Maybe not but I've seen people ask for it plenty of times. 

Would always see posts or r/pubatlegorunds asking for something for winning a match.
            you get a lot more BP in pubg when you win. I. Apex I get 4500xp for just being a live to the end the 900xp is fine but it feels so little comped to just being a live. 
    It's not just for survival time, you also get a 900xp bonus for winning.
There arent a whole lot of multiplayer games in general that give you cosmetics/loot just for winning a match. Overwatch is a full price game that uses the same reward system as Apex. 
It's not a Battle Royale thing, you do get stuff, you get get extra experience for winning and placing high. This is more an issue of people not being satisfied that a free to play game isn't giving them enough loot and they're scrounging for ways to get more for free. The entitelement is fucking thick. We get the most polished and amazing BR game in existence for free which still gives you a ton of free skins and yet people are crying that it's not enough.
    [deleted]
    H1Z1, the first big battle royale, gave out in game items. Theres no fucking entitlement lmao. It's so much more rewarding to actually get a reward than EXP.
Everyone wants free shit.

***Not everyone feels entitled to it just because they play a FREE game.***
    I just want more exp for winning than I get for surviving 5 minutes.
        Unless you are ending games as the victor in 5 minutes then you are earning more XP when you win.  Especially when you get the 500 champion XP the next round you play.  

"And this is how I spend valentine's day..."
Lucky. My wife won't even watch me for 15 seconds lol. 
Oh, fuck. Welp that’s what I get when I don’t spend money on good games...
    The game is like $5 at this point if you're not having a dirt sandwich for dinner then just buy it
        Damn okay then

Lemme just put away my *gravel* sandwich for later and hop off to the store
            Look at this fat cat with enough money to make a sandwich out of his gravel
                You made me laugh, have some silver
Rightyo, daddyo.
Oh fuck my joke did not land at all

I agreed with OP, and was kinda trying to make fun of them aswell. The idea that like there was no reason to try and win without these super over the top and ridiculous awards. I kinda wanted to play the part of "redditor that agrees with stupid suggestion"

I thought adding the part about the petition would nail home the sarcasm, but i guess i wasnt clear enough. Whoops
    Add a /s for sarcasm or gamble on getting taken seriously
    i got your joke pal idk why you got downvoted 
Could you seriously not see how sarcastic that comment was?  He even ended it with "someone make a petition or something!".  lmao
Dont take what i said seriously, it was just a failed attempt at a joke :(

I agree with you, i wanted to make that same point by basically saying "yeah, i wont try to win unless you give me these ridiculous, over the top rewards". I realise the sarcasm was really not clear in the way i worded it, so thats my bad 

I thought adding the part about the petition would make the comment just about ludicrous enough to imply the sarcasm, especially in the context of the post, but i was wrong...

    Well son, have you ever taken mushrooms?
That seems really unnecessary, I'd rather keep the game beautiful instead of getting a tiny advantage
 lowering quality does not nessicarily increase preformance.
    Specially on this modded source thing they have goin on.

Its primarily for visibility purposes.

I personally think it's pretty stupid unless you are a pro.

I didn't pay a thousand bucks on a graphics card just to put everything on low for some minimal visibility advantage. 
I might have to disagree, the average player would have a worse PC than people who are more 'hardcore' so they'd turn it down anyway. And the guys who care about fps would also turn settings down.

It's a weird world lol

        It's a little funny how he writes incredibly understand and empathetic characters - I genuinely can't imagine any of them except some of the obvious villains like bonzo even potentially being homophobic, or something - but he himself seems to not be that way

Ah yes, it's **X**enocide. It's been many years since I read the series.

Earn your right to play Titanfall 3. If you cant even beat some random mook legends, how you gon play TF|3 and be a pilot amirite. 
    Please delete your comment. I'm scared that Respawn will see it, make it a reality, and then I'll never get to play Titanfall 3.
    Yeah, like who the fuck gets killed by a MRVN. I'm sure pilots regard this tournament like pro MMA fighters see karate classes. 
Instead of “you are the champion” you get “you are the apex legend”
Yeah but this sounds cool and that’s all that matters
    I’ve already got my forum post draft written up for this system. I’m ready to complain about it being too hard and not letting me win yet.
Ranking system is good for continuous play. This idea was more of an event focus. Each season has a Champion Series where the most successful players can fight there way to the final Champion Tier, getting them a spot into a publicized Championship game for prize money. I just think it would so cool to enable 'nobody' players to make a name for themselves in the game by literally fighting their way to the top.

The big issue with this is of course greater incentive to cheat.. but I hope that due to the final few tiers having much fewer players, it would be viable to ween any cheaters out of the final Tier championship.
    The bigger issue with this is getting enough people with tier 3 and above tokens to play at the same time
        I outlined a bit in another comment. Tiers above 1-2 would have a schedule of dedicated match times to consolidate enough players at once. 
Fortnite just started a tournament system that's loosely this idea. Only a top percent gets invited to the next one and so on. It JUST started though so we'll have to wait to see if it's dope as hell
Yea this is very true. My napkin idea would be to have a pre-designated schedule of matches for each Tier. The schedule would rotate over time so if your Tier game is at 4am you can wait a few days and get into one at a more reasonable time. This champion series would run over the course of an entire season to give everyone ample time to compete. 
Books! There is a whole series, but most people just stop with Ender's Game. The sequels to Ender's Game get very political/religious/allegorical so I can see why people didn't like them as much. Still a good read.  
    It's why there's so much falloff. After Ender's Game/Shadow, the books become radically different
        With speaker for the dead being the best one of them all!
            Oh not to knock the books at all, read through the series multiple times, favorite books! I just understand why someone would pick up the second book and be confused. In middle school I put it down
                Agreed, 14 yr old me had no idea what was going on, or what was being referenced. Still trudged through them. 25 yr old me is now enlightened.
                I read Speaker first, really enjoyed it, and then went to Game for context.
                    That... Must have been pretty confusing. Interesting order.

Also, MAJOR spoilers. That pretty much ruins book 1.
    I liked the bean series a lot more than the sequels to the Ender series.
    Yea I’ve read em all.  I’m a fan.
    I actually prefer the second book. For rereading anyway.

    I feel like that sub has been gradually taken over by the people it was mocking.
        I think it's just gotten too deep for you to see which way is up. Plenty of posts are still drenched in irony
            Oh My favorite level of shit show
        The what now
            The hardcore gamers
How do we do that?
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        THANK YOU! :)
            ^^^^^^/s
I still prefer the realistic dragon mmorpg. 
THIS is definitely the most reasonable thing to think. The game has been out for less than two weeks. I hate how fast this sub has fallen into “Make this skin for this character” and “We should get this for winning.” Patience is a virtue people.
    These must all be done by people who don't have the crashing issue, cause that's the only thing I want right now.  I'll worry about cosmetics and loot when I can consistently play the game.
        I hear you.  My friend and I have finally gotten to a place where we can play with maybe one crash per day of gaming.  

The fixes seem to be so different for everyone which is frustrating.  

The EasyAntiCheat force service to restart on failure seems to have done it for me (along with a clean Origin reinstall).  Played about 4 hours yesterday with just one crash.  Of course, I also toned down my vid mem usage, set VSync to dynamic, and a bunch of other voodoo...so hard to say what really fixed it.
            Yeah, the huge list of "fixes" I keep seeing is rough, and then there's people going "I did every fix listed and it's still happening" that's real disheartening.
            Over only had it crash when I maxed the video settings at 4K but had super sampling turned on. 1440P gets a consistent frame rates without the periodic crashes so I'll leave it at that for now.
        I’ve been playing on console and don’t have the crashing issue for the most part, but even so I’m enjoying the game as is right now. One of the reasons FortNite has stayed fresh for people is thanks to the seasons and staggered updates and additions. I’d like to see this game last a long time so I’m happy to let the devs move at their own pace.
        Been having the *DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_HUNG* error crash intermittently since release, with 6+ in one night once, and just once in several hours of play the other night, but last night got two CTDs with no error (like many people have been describing) for the first time.

Was hoping I was lucky to have crashes with actual traceable error messages so they'd hopefully get fixed, but now I guess I'm in the same "hope they can get lucky and figure it out" boat as so many others. :/
        I’ve been playing on and off for the past week on PC and don’t have any issues. I’m running an i7-6700k, GTX 1070 and 12g Ram using Windows 10 Home. I have a 60hz monitor though. I’ve heard limiting frame rates could help prevent crashes. 
    Honestly the only change I ask get made as soon as possible is allowing people to reconnect when they get disconnected. Sucks when your squad is doing really well and someone's internet goes out or the game crashes for just a few moments but they're not able to rejoin that match. Just have the character stand still until they reconnect in a certain time frame.
        Especially because if they dc and you win , it doesn’t count . The only win tracker is “wins with full squad” and it only counts as a win if you have a full squad . 
        I wholeheartedly agree. I got extremely salty last night because of a disconnect. I hotdropped with my friend, got 6 kills, set up with a fully kitted longbow and r-301 (two of my favorite guns) and purple shields. It was one of the best starts to a game I've ever had. As we were running to steal a care package, my game crashed and I lost everything. Nearly ruined my night, I was so mad.

If they fixed the crashes, or if I could simply reconnect, I might have won that game. Instead my friend quit and we queued up for another and didn't win for another 4 games or so.
    Seriously.

Am I the only one that's like "hey this free game is alright let's see where it goes"
    All I see is

"We want apex to be fortnite but not fortnite, thx"
        Not at all. I don’t play FortNite, but its hard to argue its success over the past year. If this game wants to have long-term success it definitely wouldn’t hurt to take inspiration from how FortNite released its content. That doesn’t mean it needs to have the same content.
            I mean't overall from all of the other comments, not you specifically.

Since this was set as a FTP game all of the kids in fortnite jumped over and now expect fornite shit when that's just not gonna happen. 

Comments like, "Whens the pony skin coming" shit like that.
                Ah I see now. Yeah that I definitely agree with. Unfortunately that seems to always happen on game subs the more popular the game becomes.
    I'm just thinking it must be great to have so much time to play video games you're already so advanced in this game you've gotten all the free stuff and are no longer satisfied with the free game. 
I halfway agree, but crates are pretty wimpy imo so allowing one per day which most people won’t get everyday is just a decent little carrot on a stick
But still you get about the same amount of xp for winning as you do for surviving for a long period of time
I see your point regarding the potential to earn that many cosmetic items if you were to win a match every day. However, I’m willing to bet the vast majority of players don’t win a match everyday but I could be wrong! 
    And the ones who do are usually streamers and such who already spend TONS on the game and will make their viewers feel like its WAY easier to get the packs than it really is, causing many to become frustrated and just straight up buy the packs since they can't win enough games to keep all the skins like (insert streamer).
        The people who win aren't streamers it's people who are good at the game not "usually streamers".

There were 10 *MILLION* players, and 1 *MILLION* Consistent players. You really think even 100 streamers winning is the issue?
Nope, I've won twice. Just saying you're bound to win if you play enough and get some very capable teammates.
    The amount of people who would win every single day just through sheer number of games played is a very small amount of the player-base.

The amount of people who will win every day out of playing like 2 or 3 games per day is also a very small amount of the player-base.

There's not much reason for them to worry about not having anyone to whom to sell boxes when those groups make up such a small part.
        Your team just needs to drop in a low population area. Your chances will increase dramatically.
I'm trash, but im almost always top 3 because I kind of know my way around the map enough to not die. As soon as my only choice is fighting im screwed though lol
    Same here. We should go to group therapy 
        Nah just do what I do and constantly boast to your teammates about your superior "geographical battleground awareness" ^(and then get carried to a win)
I'd say I usually get a win a day and I play about six matches on average. My win rate is substantially more likely if I have a team that all use mics. The ping system is fantastic but some intricate details still can't be conveyed by a singular ping. 
Depends on your squad, with random I can usually win 1in3 matches or so. But with my usual squad we win about 80% of our games. In our usual 4-5 hour nightly sessions our minimum wins has been 10 per session since release.
    Jesus you’re good 
Easy? No. Frequent? Eh, kinda. If I’m playing with my friends I can usually get a win or two a day guaranteed. We had about 5 wins on a 3hr session a few days ago. 
I've won 20 games in 80 tries. My one friend who is wayyyy too good at this shit has about 35 in 85. 
Well if you ever had a trash freemium app, dailies are their bread and butter. It means you have to log in everyday. If youre a cheap bastard it doesnt mean much but on a large scale they probably profit from it.
Yeah what you’re not accounting for is potential lost revenue in the form of those “free boxes”. I’m sure if this was implemented, the CFO over at EA would calculate every free loot box that was given away, and he’d have a stroke after realizing all the money the company could have had. 
when they're pricing individual legendaries at 11 to 18 dollars, probably no matter what comes out of the box the total is worth $1+ in equivalence. 
Do you need my credit card number, the expiration date and the three wacky numbers on the back? 
It comes down to not being a bitch.

Somewhere, a psychologist, an economist, and a game developer sat in a room devising how to turn  the players into their bitch and make you feel compelled to buy shiny stuff.

They are betting people can't help themselves - show them better, or accept the fact that they won.
    i've never bought microtransations, (apart from 10 euro on overwatch over 1500 hrs played)

was just explaining to the guy above me why people want more rewards - so they can get the carrot on the stick thats been put in front of them
The other thing they should do is to just have a set of cosmetics attainable through achievements, like some of the badges are now.

I guess they don't want to as it would 'devalue the premium cosmetics' but I remember back in uncharted 2 when people had skins for reaching super high ranks, you got one for a certain number of kills in a game etc.

You could add in a skin for each character if that player has done certain achievements in titanfall 2 and possibly get players interested in that too (like GW2 does with some GW1 achievements).

The badges are cool and all, and tbh I have much more respect for a player with one of the harder to get badges than I ever would for a legendary skin, but they're still pretty subtle (unless you happen to be the champions).
Haha all good bro I really hope they choose to make a titanfall 3, I love the series so much 
    I've actually never been a fan of BRs... but its the "Titanfall style" that is incorporated in this game that makes it so awesome imo.

I played Titanfall 2 and love it too (never played original), and its awesome to see them "evolve" their games.
        Yeah definitely, having so many hours in titanfall 2, Apex felt like second nature as soon as I started playing. I have actually been a fan of BRS since playing them but Apex is my favourite 
            One thing I noticed was the movement came super naturally to me. Jumping, sliding, wall climbing all felt familiar a few games in.
                The only thing I *think* is different is that sprinting doesn't take you out of (toggle) ads. I feel like that was a thing in Titanfall and while I'm not sure, I've definitely died a few times because I thought I was
                    Maybe because sprint button is also the scope zoom toggle button, by default? Not sure if it'd change if you were to unbind the zoom toggle button. 
                    I feel like it was too, and if it wasn't Titanfall it's definitely like that in most other FPSs.
        Yeah the combat in other BRs always felt off for me, I was awful at it compared to other shooters. I'm used to playing Titanfall so that transition felt so much more natural
    I thought they already said tf3 was canceled?
        They did
    This exchange is too wholesome and positive for a shitpost, someone talk shit quick.
Further proving the importance of good marketing
I miss my Tone. God did she piss people off before her Nerf.
    The urge to downvote was strong
There hasn’t been a battle royale where you get prizes for winning. Why are people all of a sudden surprised a F2P game doesn’t have them..? 
    Maybe not but I've seen people ask for it plenty of times. 

Would always see posts or r/pubatlegorunds asking for something for winning a match.
        you get a lot more BP in pubg when you win. I. Apex I get 4500xp for just being a live to the end the 900xp is fine but it feels so little comped to just being a live. 
It's not just for survival time, you also get a 900xp bonus for winning.
[deleted]
H1Z1, the first big battle royale, gave out in game items. Theres no fucking entitlement lmao. It's so much more rewarding to actually get a reward than EXP.
I just want more exp for winning than I get for surviving 5 minutes.
    Unless you are ending games as the victor in 5 minutes then you are earning more XP when you win.  Especially when you get the 500 champion XP the next round you play.  

The game is like $5 at this point if you're not having a dirt sandwich for dinner then just buy it
    Damn okay then

Lemme just put away my *gravel* sandwich for later and hop off to the store
        Look at this fat cat with enough money to make a sandwich out of his gravel

        Speaker is such a good book
Being a fan of the Ender or Shadow series became a lot harder when Orson Scott Card revealed how crazy he was.
    How crazy are we talking here? 
        Huge racist and homophobe
            Aw man he’s been my favorite author all my life. Damn it 😂🤦🏻‍♂️
        Basically, hes radically LDS and hates gays.
            I guess I was young enough to not pick up on it back then
        We're talking comparing Obama to Hitler and saying that his political "goal" would be to lock up all homosexuals crazy. 
    It's a little funny how he writes incredibly understand and empathetic characters - I genuinely can't imagine any of them except some of the obvious villains like bonzo even potentially being homophobic, or something - but he himself seems to not be that way
    [deleted]
        The irony of judging something ahead of time was already in his books. How the fuck could he be so un-self-aware?
            Upbringing? Social groups? Media diet? 
                Culture of the time? All of the above?
        Never before or since have I been so let down by an authors personality. I read the books and then found out who he was, what a gross man.
Does the sub need a Speaker?
That just means this comment chain has happened before, and probably with similar sounding replies. Clearly not a good sub idea for it to be dead by this repetition.
It has no mods! Quick somebody request it at /r/Redditrequest
I know it’s my fault but it’s like, I finally get to be that person y’know
    Lol it's really unfortunate too. You just so happen to be reading it right now and a random spoiler shows up on the Apex Legends subreddit. That's just unlucky
        Thank you! It is really funny when you put it that way tho, but pop culture gonna pop I guess lol
They called me a madman
>Ender the Xenocide

Ah yes, it's **X**enocide. It's been many years since I read the series.
    Xeno means relating to a foreigner or foreigners.

As in "xenophobia".


Please delete your comment. I'm scared that Respawn will see it, make it a reality, and then I'll never get to play Titanfall 3.
Yeah, like who the fuck gets killed by a MRVN. I'm sure pilots regard this tournament like pro MMA fighters see karate classes. 
I’ve already got my forum post draft written up for this system. I’m ready to complain about it being too hard and not letting me win yet.
The bigger issue with this is getting enough people with tier 3 and above tokens to play at the same time
    I outlined a bit in another comment. Tiers above 1-2 would have a schedule of dedicated match times to consolidate enough players at once.

This exchange is too wholesome and positive for a shitpost, someone talk shit quick.
The urge to downvote was strong
Maybe not but I've seen people ask for it plenty of times. 

Would always see posts or r/pubatlegorunds asking for something for winning a match.
    you get a lot more BP in pubg when you win. I. Apex I get 4500xp for just being a live to the end the 900xp is fine but it feels so little comped to just being a live. 
Unless you are ending games as the victor in 5 minutes then you are earning more XP when you win.  Especially when you get the 500 champion XP the next round you play.  

Damn okay then

Lemme just put away my *gravel* sandwich for later and hop off to the store
    Look at this fat cat with enough money to make a sandwich out of his gravel

I'm such a nerd..ender technically made it his goal to protect the last egg of the queen and find her a new planet to propogate on in peace.
    Speaker is such a good book
How crazy are we talking here?

        Aw man he’s been my favorite author all my life. Damn it 😂🤦🏻‍♂️
    Basically, hes radically LDS and hates gays.
        I guess I was young enough to not pick up on it back then
    We're talking comparing Obama to Hitler and saying that his political "goal" would be to lock up all homosexuals crazy. 
It's a little funny how he writes incredibly understand and empathetic characters - I genuinely can't imagine any of them except some of the obvious villains like bonzo even potentially being homophobic, or something - but he himself seems to not be that way

    The irony of judging something ahead of time was already in his books. How the fuck could he be so un-self-aware?
        Upbringing? Social groups? Media diet? 
            Culture of the time? All of the above?
    Never before or since have I been so let down by an authors personality. I read the books and then found out who he was, what a gross man.
Lol it's really unfortunate too. You just so happen to be reading it right now and a random spoiler shows up on the Apex Legends subreddit. That's just unlucky
    Thank you! It is really funny when you put it that way tho, but pop culture gonna pop I guess lol
Xeno means relating to a foreigner or foreigners.

As in "xenophobia".


I outlined a bit in another comment. Tiers above 1-2 would have a schedule of dedicated match times to consolidate enough players at once. 
With speaker for the dead being the best one of them all!
    Oh not to knock the books at all, read through the series multiple times, favorite books! I just understand why someone would pick up the second book and be confused. In middle school I put it down
        Agreed, 14 yr old me had no idea what was going on, or what was being referenced. Still trudged through them. 25 yr old me is now enlightened.
        I read Speaker first, really enjoyed it, and then went to Game for context.
            That... Must have been pretty confusing. Interesting order.

Also, MAJOR spoilers. That pretty much ruins book 1.
I think it's just gotten too deep for you to see which way is up. Plenty of posts are still drenched in irony

THANK YOU! :)

I hear you.  My friend and I have finally gotten to a place where we can play with maybe one crash per day of gaming.  

The fixes seem to be so different for everyone which is frustrating.  

The EasyAntiCheat force service to restart on failure seems to have done it for me (along with a clean Origin reinstall).  Played about 4 hours yesterday with just one crash.  Of course, I also toned down my vid mem usage, set VSync to dynamic, and a bunch of other voodoo...so hard to say what really fixed it.
    Yeah, the huge list of "fixes" I keep seeing is rough, and then there's people going "I did every fix listed and it's still happening" that's real disheartening.
    Over only had it crash when I maxed the video settings at 4K but had super sampling turned on. 1440P gets a consistent frame rates without the periodic crashes so I'll leave it at that for now.
I’ve been playing on console and don’t have the crashing issue for the most part, but even so I’m enjoying the game as is right now. One of the reasons FortNite has stayed fresh for people is thanks to the seasons and staggered updates and additions. I’d like to see this game last a long time so I’m happy to let the devs move at their own pace.
Been having the *DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_HUNG* error crash intermittently since release, with 6+ in one night once, and just once in several hours of play the other night, but last night got two CTDs with no error (like many people have been describing) for the first time.

Was hoping I was lucky to have crashes with actual traceable error messages so they'd hopefully get fixed, but now I guess I'm in the same "hope they can get lucky and figure it out" boat as so many others. :/
I’ve been playing on and off for the past week on PC and don’t have any issues. I’m running an i7-6700k, GTX 1070 and 12g Ram using Windows 10 Home. I have a 60hz monitor though. I’ve heard limiting frame rates could help prevent crashes. 
Especially because if they dc and you win , it doesn’t count . The only win tracker is “wins with full squad” and it only counts as a win if you have a full squad . 
I wholeheartedly agree. I got extremely salty last night because of a disconnect. I hotdropped with my friend, got 6 kills, set up with a fully kitted longbow and r-301 (two of my favorite guns) and purple shields. It was one of the best starts to a game I've ever had. As we were running to steal a care package, my game crashed and I lost everything. Nearly ruined my night, I was so mad.

If they fixed the crashes, or if I could simply reconnect, I might have won that game. Instead my friend quit and we queued up for another and didn't win for another 4 games or so.
Not at all. I don’t play FortNite, but its hard to argue its success over the past year. If this game wants to have long-term success it definitely wouldn’t hurt to take inspiration from how FortNite released its content. That doesn’t mean it needs to have the same content.
    I mean't overall from all of the other comments, not you specifically.

Since this was set as a FTP game all of the kids in fortnite jumped over and now expect fornite shit when that's just not gonna happen. 

Comments like, "Whens the pony skin coming" shit like that.
        Ah I see now. Yeah that I definitely agree with. Unfortunately that seems to always happen on game subs the more popular the game becomes.
The people who win aren't streamers it's people who are good at the game not "usually streamers".

There were 10 *MILLION* players, and 1 *MILLION* Consistent players. You really think even 100 streamers winning is the issue?
Your team just needs to drop in a low population area. Your chances will increase dramatically.
Nah just do what I do and constantly boast to your teammates about your superior "geographical battleground awareness" ^(and then get carried to a win)
Yeah definitely, having so many hours in titanfall 2, Apex felt like second nature as soon as I started playing. I have actually been a fan of BRS since playing them but Apex is my favourite 
    One thing I noticed was the movement came super naturally to me. Jumping, sliding, wall climbing all felt familiar a few games in.
        The only thing I *think* is different is that sprinting doesn't take you out of (toggle) ads. I feel like that was a thing in Titanfall and while I'm not sure, I've definitely died a few times because I thought I was
            Maybe because sprint button is also the scope zoom toggle button, by default? Not sure if it'd change if you were to unbind the zoom toggle button. 
            I feel like it was too, and if it wasn't Titanfall it's definitely like that in most other FPSs.
Yeah the combat in other BRs always felt off for me, I was awful at it compared to other shooters. I'm used to playing Titanfall so that transition felt so much more natural
