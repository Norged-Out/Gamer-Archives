                Bet I'm better at walking at a fence than you though.
                I dunno I’ve put up a lot of fences in my day.   What equipment did you use?
                    He's into competitive fencing, so maybe a hammer with a lifetime warranty
                        Probably using lithium brushless drivers and nail guns as well.

                They already do it, you have to spend money to unlock the seasonal ability to spend money on the seasons rewards
        Anytime someone comments on something cool I pick up, I am quick to mention I have paypal and Apple Pay
    That's when I leave. Only reason I still play is the packs are only cosmetic.
        Same.  I think that's the big barrier between what is okay as far as a money grab and what is not.  Pay to win is enough to spoil even the best game for me.
            There are bigger implications to this though. For instance, in kids schools these days, *default* is a derogatory slur for someone who can't afford skins. Think of all the kids out there spending their entire allowance on fucking *slot machines* in order to increase their social status.  
That there is fucked up. And now they want to charge $7 per pack. Fuck right off.
                My kids call me a default..
                    My dude .. take a seat.
                    Oooffff
                    F
                    My friends have like the most  expensive looking skins in cs:go and other games, and I always get the skins no one really wants, the ones that look military or just normal cause I hate unrealistic shit...  


I think my collection of skins worth 2€ is better than the 100€ funky color skins =D
                        I've never bought a Fortnite skin, hence, me being a default.
                    You look that little shit dead in the eye and call him a Rust Lord.
                    Mine too
                    Trade the kid in for skins
                That is fucked up.  But unfortunately kids can be that way.  

Just playing devils advocate, if there wasn't a system to purchase these cosmetic items, how could the game survive other than ad revenue? Keep in mind I'm pretty new to gaming so theres a chance I'm missing a big part of the industry.
                    The skins could be directly for sale. That's how it worked for the longest time. Now you have to draw the right skin at random.
                        Ah, I missed the importance placed on "slot machines".  Yes. Fucked up.
                            Example: Fortnite.  Rotating shop inventory. Everyone can buy the items when they're in the shop.
                                People get excited to see what's going to be on rotation the next day. Still a form of behavioral manipulation, but not the kind approved by Satan.
                        And at the very least, if we're gonna do this loot box shit, make it so you can't get duplicates *whatsoever.*
                            I thought Apex loot boxes don't give duplicates?
                                They dont.
                        that wouldn't stop the kids from spending tons of money and mocking the kids who dont...
                            It basically does. I don't remember league of legends having problems like that. Once you can just buy a specific skin from a list, it's not really special that you have it.
                    True but I'm pretty sure introducing children to gambling and then preying on their ignorance is immoral if not illegal.   Should kids be able to play slots in Vegas?  The problem everyone has here is the loot box mechanic
                        Can I be frank? I never understood the issue with loot boxes until, your post. Taking advantage of kids is absolutely evil and manipulatice yet I've always seen it in terms of adults
                        Pokemon cards coming in booster packs is essentially the same concept.

Random chance to get something of value.
                            I would argue that trading card games are pretty scummy as well. They always become a game of who has more money to buy more cards. Bad systems are bad, whether other things are ALSO bad doesn't make a difference.
                            I always see this argument come up on lootbox discussions and it’s...a pretty good one lol
                                The argument against it is that you're getting a physical item that can be sold on the second-hand market.
                            >booster packs

Difference is physical ownership and the ability to retain market value. Booster pack card can be resold/bought individually and the buyer retains the option to list market value. Electronic goods from loot boxes have no physical ownership (only license to use) to you and there is no market value for the purchaser to retain. IE: The host of the game could shut the game down and "your" electronic goods go with it with no recourse to retain purchases.
                            It's 2nd hand market but I can buy a specific card and nothing is violating terms. Not a fan of trading card games either though, even with that.
                    That’s why my kid will take martial arts lessons so anyone that tries to default him can get eliminated.
                        Make sure your kid isn’t wearing the default gi & belt.
                    It couldn’t possibly survive without at least “game breaking” ads (imagine watching a 30 second ad after legend selection [LOL]). 

However, they could take little to no hit by making mtx reasonably priced, from increased sales
                    I think the issue is that these 20 skins or whatever they are for JUST the iron crown event cost significantly more than a regular game, but apex has significantly less actual game content than that. If the game had more content or the skins cost significantly less it wouldn’t be as much of an issue. But they’re trying to coax people into spending insane amounts of cash on cosmetic items just because the game was “free to play” even though the gameplay content just isn’t there. The game remains mostly stagnant with a few gameplay add ons here and there, but nothing even close to a triple A title you would only pay $80-$120 for. And I shutter at the fact that $80-$120 for a game is something I’m following the word “only” with.
                Growing up didn't the kids do the same thing in regards to clothing, such as name brand clothes vs whatever else?  The medium might have changed but kids mocking the disparity of wealth hasn't and most likely won't ever change.
                    The big differentiation being that those kids can at least buy the exact piece of clothing they want. They don't go to the clothing store to find a guy with all the clothes behind the counter who asks for money, puts on a blindfold and chucks 3 random things in the kids face.
                    That's true man.  I had rebock pump knock offs and got mocked for them.  But they still shouldn't be introducing kids to gambling.
                I agree with you but the analogy isn’t great, kids are going to spend their allowance on shit to impress their friends no matter what, this gen it happens to be game skins, when I was a kid it was CD’s or band shirts. They’re kids without jobs it’s not like they’re saving up for retirement
                Kids these days don't know the sheer joy of stomping a blinged out server with nothing but default skins and stock weapons while saying nothing in chat.

It makes people so angry for no good reason.
                Grown man here, is this really a thing? 'Default' as an insult?
            I'll put some money into the game because of how much I enjoy it and want to support, but if it ever becomes pay to win I'm gone.
            Micro transactions always make me think of that line from the last DJ. "while all the boys upstairs see how much you'll pay for what you used to get for free." I think micro transactions are unethical as fuck because it's basically gambling.
        I quit Clash Royale because they did a huge money grab and introduced a monthly sub.

The P2W before that was absolutely there, but much more restrained.
    Hey can you open this supply bin for me I don’t get paid till next week.
    This... This has officially made my evening!

    What are you talking about? Nobody saw that coming!
        We were blindly hopeful. But we all knew this would happen sooner or later
            Isn’t it just cosmetics? I’m truly confused as to why people are upset about a free game having cosmetics needing to be purchased.
                It’s not that.. it’s like a slot machine.. you might get 1 of 5 items.. maybe the one you want maybe not.. you’re guaranteed to get it after 5 tries or $20.. which ever come first
                    That’s not that insane. Lots of games have skins that cost a lot. It’s cosmetics that literally don’t matter at all. It’s a first person game, you can’t see them. The people who are shooting at you aren’t paying attention. 

I really would like to see both sides who but who gives a shit.
                        People play games for lots of reasons, and despite the fact that you personally don't care about cosmetics doesn't mean that other people don't. Like Contada said, it's not that the skins cost a lot (Which is to be expected to a degree if the game is F2P otherwise), it's the fact that you have to gamble with your money and HOPE that you eventually get the cosmetics that you want. 

I'm sure that I spent literal hundreds of dollars on skins in League of Legends, over the many years that I played that game. I was happy to pay a premium to support an otherwise-free game, to get cool cosmetics that made the experience more enjoyable for me. But every time I spent 10 or 20 bucks on skins, I *knew* what I was getting. People don't like being dicked around by gamble boxes, and having to put money into a slot machine indefinitely in the hopes that they'll get what they want. Again, it's great that you don't mind either way, more power to you, but RNG lootbox/slot-machine mechanics exist solely for the purpose of bringing in more money, not enhancing the gameplay experience at all.
            Can you explain what’s happened? Are EA forcing me to buy all these meaningless cosmetics?
                No, they're forcing their developers though to make them and to make them as enticing as possible like casino managers.
                No ones forcing you and no one said they did. Stop with the red herrings. That’s a very lazy and disingenuous way to make an argument.

What I actually said was the we all knew that EA would push these self-sabotaging, money-grabbing techniques on Respawn sooner or later. This is what they always do. They destroyed Dice and countless other studios with this bs.
                Lol no shit. I dont play apex anymore but i see all this whining on my front page when its literally just cosmetics that noone even notices. Why people buy them i have no clue. I never once noticed what cosmetics someone was wearing unless i killed them and picked up their gun.

People think "ill look so cool in that" bur seriously noone even looks at ur character long enough to make it worth any more than $1
                    This is the only comment that matters in this entire thread lmao.
    Love how all the good stuff = Respawn

All the bad stuff = EA
        Did you see the good monetization Respawn did with Titanfall 1 and 2 when they were still fully in control?

Free updates, affordable cosmetic items, prices that made sense, a lot of free stuff that you could earn in game.

There is just no way devs like that go to shitty practices all of the sudden like that
            Sorry, you can't compare paid games with a free to play game. That's not how it works.

Respawn has said *ad nauseam* how EA is hands off with this game. These cosmetics and prices are 100% on Respawn.
                Did you believe all that pr talk? It's even probably EA that told them to say that. Nobody wanted to have EA associated with them after the loot box disaster.

But again we're both speculating so I'll give you the benefit of the doubt
                    Man I hate statements like that. 

If you don't believe the "pr talk" then wouldn't it be safe to assume that EA actually did most of the work with Respawn only helping? You can't only make assumptions that help your argument.
                        >wouldn't it be safe to assume that EA actually did most of the work with Respawn only helping?

No? Because Respawn is the developer and EA only acts as the publisher here. What does a publisher do? They decide on pricing, marketing (what needs to be said around the game), etc. So assuming EA might have encouraged Respawn to go with that statement makes sense.

I don't even understand how you could come up with Respawn only helping. Even if you did believe that, just the fact that there is so many similarities between the Titanfall games and Apex just proves it wrong
                Well, the free to play game was a financial success, while both Titanfalls weren't. Is the money obtained from Titanfall sales enough to overwhelm the money Apex did?
                    TIL that a franchise that sold **14 million copies** across 2 games is not a financial success.
            I mean, the updates are still free...
            Good monetization? You mean the games that couldn't make money?
        Yes, that’s typically how it goes. Developers are the ones making the content we want. Producers are the ones putting that content behind absurd “surprise mechanics”.
    People should have expected to pay for stuff as soon as they downloaded a free game. Thank god it’s all cosmetic. I don’t think they’ve done anything wrong yet
        Yeah, but the cosmetics are bit crap. The problem is that I *want* the game to be supported with cosmetics, but it's consistently a really bad deal.
            Then don't buy them
            People pay for it. The decision how much this costs isn't made arbitrarily.
                Like with all of these, it's a handful of people with spending problems. They're worth more than the rest of the population put together. I get that.

But then, because most people are just going to see gambling addict bait, of course they're going to find it pathetic.
        Tell me about it, I played counterstrike. They think this is a bad deal? Pathetic.
            That's a bad comparison, because cs skins can be sold for an absurd amount of money. Every cs skin has value. Apex skins will never have real value like that.
                Isn’t that just closer to actual gambling?
                    Yup, but it's the same thing with most games with loot boxes now in the sense that you open a box that costs money for a chance at receiving something you want. Only difference is with cs you get actual value back. That's why everyone is so pissed with Respawn and EA, spending $7 PER box to get something cosmetic that doesn't even have true value is absurd.
                        Respawn has gone out of their way to talk about how this is their game and EA doesn't run the show.



It's all on Respawn
                        Here’s a suggestion. Don’t spend money on cosmetics in games. Problem solved. Moving on.
                            For a real answer: it affects the rest of us because we are no longer the customers, only the cosmetic players are customers.

Sure we may *buy* a game, but the upsell base is the real financial driver for these companies. Major publishers will continue ramp up not just the number of transactions, but the *integration* of transactions in games. 

Treading into controversial territory... From here on is absolutely my own opinion:

Unfortunately without regulation the game industry just becomes another major loss for consumers.

                    They do though, there are plenty of 3rd party sites that allow you to sell them for real money, crypto, etc.

                    My glock fade turned into $180 a few years ago. That value felt pretty real.
            Dude, I'm on your side that while it is a scummy practice, it is only for comestic items. But your comparison of downloading a free game vs Counter Strike is dumb. Up to last year, CS wasn't free, it was about 15 bucks. Then if you wanted you could buy a key that costs 2.50 bucks to open a lootcrate. If anything CS had less of an excuse because they essentially where double dipping.
                CS gave me a free skin which I then went and sold for $180. Now, I got lucky, but it wasn’t impossible to get the skins you wanted for free, and, worst case scenario, you could just buy the one you wanted from the marketplace. 

There’s no option here to buy what I want. I have to gamble with loot boxes and hope that I roll the right one. That’s the major difference. People wouldn’t be as mad if they allowed direct purchases. I hear rainbow 6 siege does that, though I don’t actually play it so I don’t know for sure, but nobody is rioting over there.
        Sure they haven’t done anything wrong yet, but players like myself are pissed because we were willing to buy this season’s $10 battle pass only to find out the skins in it were fairly lame. In comes this timed event with skins everyone wants, but it’s behind a $150 paywall, far beyond the price of two normally priced games (thus negating the argument that this pricing is just “recouping the costs of this being a F2P game”)
        I buy the battle passes because it gives me something to do and supports the developers. I feel I'm getting my money's worth. If the game really goes to shit, I won't buy them anymore. I still have no idea why people get so twisted over FUCKING COSMETICS. Don't buy them, easy. It's not like they are putting entire characters behind paywalls.
            I know! I actually thought it was pretty nice of them to allow characters to be unlocked so easily through in game play. That’s something they could’ve easily locked behind a paywall
                The in game cost to unlock legends is pretty reasonable. If you buy one battle pase, you can also grind enough by the end to buy another oass wi5h in game currency. It's still a free game. Don't like it? Don't play.
    i feel like a slowpoke meme would be more apt.
    It's a free game. You think they should just make games and not make any money from it at all? You people are really annoying.
        Great take, now watch as they proceed to make much less money than they could have because of a fundamental misunderstanding their playerbase demographics and how much disposable income they're willing to throw at a game like this.
            You'd be surprised how much money kids will dump into cosmetics. I have nephews who put a large portion of their gift money into skins. Over any given year, that's probably more than a half dozen AAA titles worth poured into 1 game.
                Kids spend money on dumb shit because they can and don't have bills or other things to pay for. We used to buy knockoff zippos and /r/mallninjashit-esque knives and swords at the fair just because we could. Pokémon cards, pogs, stretchy bracelets, anything we could buy for a few bucks. We bought useless shit because they were the only things we could buy, and usually because our friends had them too. This seems like a modern version of that. 

I guess I don't see how this is any different from what kids normally buy when they get a little money to throw around aside from the gambling aspect, which is shady. Card booster packs have been doing that for ages. Not that it makes either of them better or acceptable but that type of mechanic has been around for a long, long time. Other than that, it just seems like people getting pissy about a free game doing free game things.
                    That's pretty true. We dumped heaps on crappy trading cards - and not just sport ones that could have value, crap like Jurassic Park trading cards.
            Reddit isn’t the average demographic of any popular games player base
                Maybe those anime dating sims
            Why do you think you know better than their analysts? Are you basing this on anything other than gut feeling?
                Because no studio under the Activision/EA banner has ever run a game into the ground before?

What about the analysts they employed at the time?
                    They probably said " do this and you will make 100 million before finishing returns" and they did just that.
Don’t give them ideas
    EA is full of this kind of shit, they already have these kind of ideas.
        Doesn't COD's blackout have something like this now? Crates during the game only players who bought the pass or whatever it's called can open. 

&#x200B;

I stopped playing that long time ago.
            Blackjack's stash 
  
And yeah you have to earn the weapons from the black market in the game to be able to open a box in blackout that can contain any of the guns you've unlocked
                OK so not quite the same. That game's gotten so crazy with the passes and loot boxes and micro transactions, I don't know how anyone keeps up.
                    Honestly I only keep up bc of the subreddit. I mean I own the game, but multiplayer and blackout didn't hold up as well as I thought they would, and zombies was lackluster due to the changes they made to the perk system. I don't own the black ops pass but the fact that bo4 has the same MTX system as fortnite, just without as nice looking of skins or whatever is really bananas for a AAA title that could cost upwards of $120
                        The games 110 dollars plus all the money you have to spend to get all the guns. And of course the guns you get are random so you spend 500 bucks and still not get a single weapon and just get a fuckton of emotes and stickers
                            I really hope Modern Warfare doesn't end up doing this shit too. That game looks so promising and could honestly revive the series if they pull it off correctly. Part of me thinks they'll be able to do it but part of me knows it's still an Activision game and they'll probably do something similar to how they waited a month for reviews to come in on BO4 before they introduced tons of ridiculous microtransactions.
                                Yeah, I'm hoping IW can breathe some life back into COD with the Modern Warfare reboot, but knowing our luck I fear the game will get buttfucked by Activision
                                    IW has to recover from the shitfest that was Infinite Warfare.  


MW is supposed to have no MTX.  But then again who knows
                                Exactly why I’m waiting. It’s IW we’re talking about and they aren’t sellouts like Treyarch so I doubt it’ll happen. But both the Treyarch games in the last 4 years had Treyarch and Activision saying “we will have no MTX” then a month later they release MTX and say “we need to make money somehow, there will be no pay to win MTX” then a month later we have pay to win MTX. 

When you put Activision and Treyarch in the same room together all the CoD fans are about to get assfucked
                                I have some bad news for you, friend. A lot of what Activision makes for revenue is MTX shit. They'll do it again. It worked for BLOPS4 where the game sold well initially and then they dropped in the MTX crap. They did it with Modern Warfare Remastered. They'll do it again.
                    I gave up early.

Me and my friends spent so much time grinding blackout to unlock the characters by completing the in game challenges, most of which relied on luck of finding required item (if it spawned) and placing or winning the game. We got most of the characters available, and it took a lot of effort and patience. Then one day we started app, checked the store, and there were the characters we spent all that time earning. Fuck that game. There's no point in trying to earn anything in CoD because any effort is just wasted. 

Anyways, thats my story of how I gave up on black ops.
                They actually called them *Blackjack*? Ballsy move.
                I know COD's trash, and their fanbase is not the brightest... By that I just mean they dish out 60+ bucks for the same game they played last year, but why does something that is CLEARLY bullshit not call for revolt? An entire Gamemode dedicated to everyone having the same obstacles to overcome decides to have hidden guns you can ONLY get when you buy them through their market???
                    Bo4 is the most egregious cash grab I have seen from Activision, bar them remastering AND reimagining the modern warfare serious. 
  
After bo3 and it's loot boxes, we got infinite warfare, which at least gave the base variant of every new weapon to owners of the season pass, and then world war 2 followed almost the exact same suit. 
  
Activision, and by extension treyarch, are fucking clods, that are spearheading a movement into gaming, where every game has a battlepass and cosmetics to buy. But the game itself is still $60
                        [deleted]
                            truly sad how treyarch did live long enough to see themselves become the villain, if only sledgehammer games wasn't the villain at the beginning with advanced warfare
                                Exactly. Were it not for Sledgehammer tossing supply drops into Advanced Warfare as well as making them purchasable with better odds, the **entire** loot box fad wouldn’t exist. I respect Sledgehammer for changing their ways with how they did things within WWII, they’re still completely to blame for loot boxes becoming a thing. No CoD had them prior to Advanced Warfare.
                        I will say this, the modern warfare remaster was a massive overhaul. Have you tried it? I also got it for free I’m pretty sure…
                    > By that I just mean they dish out 60+ bucks for the same game they played last year

*[EA sports and 2k players be like](https://i.imgflip.com/2ywi2b.png)*

But seriously though, a new game every year and with Ultimate Teams kills any longevity of a sports game. I would be inclined to buy more sports game if they stayed with the game for 3 years or so before they dropped the next one. It's like as soon as they drop a game there is maybe a few months of updates and then they work on the following years game. I have no idea why anyone would want to put in time and money for ultimate teams just for it to become essentially obsolete within a year or so because the playerbase is playing the new title.
            Activision is just as bad maybe worse than EA but they seem to get a pass.  COD isn’t a free game and they do that crap.
            Lol it wouldn't surprise me. I played that game a lot till apex came out and I haven't played since. Actually downloaded some updates to try it out a few days ago and the first thing I saw on the openingb cutscene was Ruin running on a beach with one of those round floaties around his waist. So weird haha
            Jesus fucking Christ. Companies have decided to stop copying and just straight up hire Satan themselves.
        And I don’t understand why? If the skins had reasonable prices they’d be making a lot more money than they are right now. Because I highly doubt anybody is willing to pay 12 bucks for an epic skin. 

Make the epic character skins like 3-4 bucks and the epic weapon skins like 1 or 2. I’m sure a lot more people would be willing to buy a lot of skins. At least more inclined than they are now, at 12$ a pop.

I do however suspect they don’t even want you to buy the skins. The absurd prices are probably there to make you buy apex packs instead where you’ll probably not even get an epic for those 12$

Believe it. Hell, this game made over 90 million the first month. The only reason revenue dipped heavily in the 2nd month was because there was nothing new to buy.
            They're targeting the whales who are willing to spend thousands of dollars to max out their inventory. It's what devs do in mobile games. Everyone hates this model, but it makes a lot of money.
            If a free to play game has high quality skins, I'd definitely spend 12 to buy a good skin for my favourite character to support the game I love. My personal budget for free games is 50 bucks a month, and yes that usually goes to permanent cosmetic content, regardless of the price, as long as I like the skin.

    Nothing you can purchase changes anything about the actual gameplay.
        Then why are people complaining? It is literally a free game... as long as loot boxes do not affect gameplay, I am indifferent about them. People just get upset because they spend $20 on apex coins only to not get what they wanted. Sorry, maybe spend your money more wisely.
            The majority of players don’t care. Reddit is a very vocal minority that absolutely loves a good circle jerk.
                ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) I love a good circle jerk, personally
                    Same tbh family
                        Same here tho
                This place is cancer
            Been playing Apex nearly since it came out. Have not spent a dime. It's a lot of fun. I have considered paying something to basically thank the devs. That game is worth more than the $10 or $20 I will give them because I have put so many hours into that game. However, I'm thankful that no gameplay is affected by in game purchases at all, it's all purely cosmetic (like fortnight? Idk, don't play it but I think it does the same)
                I honestly feel like I should spend a few bucks here there because of how much I play it. I was never really into any battle royale games till respawn came around
            People complain because it replaces a satisfying system with a money making system
            I don’t understand either. If they had to pay to play the game, I’d get it. But it’s a FREE game. You can choose to pay for the cosmetics and it won’t give you any higher chance of winning. 

Honestly I just feel like most people complaining are just looking for something to complain about
                Because people bought the battle pass which only had 2 skins in it and it seems like all the badass skins were saved for this event. Not the main reason but uts gotta hurt for sure. So saying it's a free game is true but once you get that pass it's not free anymore.
                    I bought the battle pass because it was a reaeonable cost and I spend a lot of hours there. The challenges give me something to do. I could care less about skins.
                    You can see what's in the battle pass before purchase. What's the problem here?
            [deleted]
                The slight devil's advocate here is that some of us genuinely want to spend money to support the game and enhance our experience. But they've priced out their own fans. Long term means lost revenue and support meaning the game will die quicker
                Is it wrong to expect new content, even just cosmetics, to be priced reasonably for the average consumer? There are people willing to spend up to $20 bucks for a single skin, but apparently that's not good enough for EAspawn.
            Reddit loves to complain about people wanting to make money. The vocal minority believes a free game needs to have every single thing free and the people slaving to make it shouldn’t be compensated for their hard work. And if it is completely free, they complain about ads that make money lol
            I agree, I’m not defending loot boxes and the purposeful addiction ethics.  
  
Since there is no trading system, it’s all completely overblown and I don’t think most adults care
            Honestly, how are they expecting updates to a free game if there is no microtransactions to support production? Loot boxes and rng is bullshit but if it doesn't effect gameplay, they can just not buy it.
            >Then why are people complaining? It is literally a free game... as long as loot boxes do not affect gameplay

Tell people to spend more wisely, indicating It's  a bad investment, then confused about why people are complaining.  Can't actually fathom how you can't comprehend the reason people dislike lootboxes, crazy you actually got 200 upvotes. From like minded idiots I suppose.   
Guess using your brain is too much to ask for these days.
            I think Apex is being brigaded. Easy way for Fortnite to stamp out it's competition is by stirring up a minority of child/teenage players with posts like these and lessening the popularity of Apex from within it's own community.
                Jesus, I hadn’t even looked through the subreddit recently. Almost every post is shitting on the game right now...
                    It was even worse in season one lol
                        Hm, kinda goes to show you how it really is to each their own. I enjoyed the shit out of season 1 with my friends...
                            Oh, I meant that I thought the complaining on here was more prevalant back then. Seems to mostly always revolve around cosmetics. Back then that they weren't good. Now that they're good, too expensive lol.
                                Sorry I think we had some miscommunication but I am definitely agreeing with you. What I meant was it is funny that people were here bitching and morning about whatever, and meanwhile I had literally no issues with season 1. Maybe that is because I didn’t buy the battle pass.. but why buy it if you already saw the shitty rewards lmao
                                    Yeah, I didnt buy it either. Picked up Titanfall 2 complete edition for cheaper than the BP and that was and is a lot of fun.
            Right. After playing for a few dozen hours at first, I was interested enough to buy packs to support the game that I've gotten so much entertainment out of and to hopefully get some neat skins. Out of like 20 crates, I got like 3 items I thought were cool. I'll never buy packs again (though I don't regret it).

This whole crate thing is stupid as fuck. It's literally gambling. It's insulting to sit there and have the slot machine tactics try to excite you with lights and presentation and then have garbage come out. Younger minds are more susceptible to these tactics and it's an irresponsible way to make money. If they offered a way to buy the skins and stuff you want specifically, I would definitely pay for that. I will not pay for the chance to hopefully maybe get it by luck.
            I don’t think it’s right to put gambling in a game but for all the people who don’t want to spend money this won’t affect them at all. I don’t keep up to date with the changes they make in this game but if it’s all cosmetic it’s pretty ridiculous to compare that to buying weapons in-game.
            Because microtransactions bad and we deserve all post-launch cosmetics for free obviously
                Because gambling is bad sir
            It’s not about the cosmetic themselves but the fact that the only way to earn these items is to pay. You can play some 500 hours of this game all you want and I’m not excusing blizzard’s practise either but at least in Overwatch you have an option to play and earn. It’s absolutely mental how Respawn hasn’t sorted this shit out. 

I just want to play and earn, not pay and burn (a hole through my wallet).
                You are playing a free game! How do you expect them to make money? The developers can't eat "hours a player put into the game" and servers don't run on love.
                Who.. the fuck.. cares?  You think they make money off of people who just play 500 hours?  No.  It's a free game.  IT'S A FREE GAME!  Honestly, you should be willing to spend money on a game that you sink 500 hours into, but it's not required.
                Boo hoo, you don't get more free stuff on top of the free game you play. What a whiner
        > changes anything about the actual gameplay. 

wont the new axe change that tho? you have a weapon on the landing
            They don’t deal any additional damage. See wraiths knife.
                ah ok, shiet im glad to hear that
        This is exactly why I don't get why people are so up in arms about the payment system. The game is free guys
        Well, some skins actually have preferable Iron sights. Not too game changing but they can make a difference for certain players.

Edit: Autocorrect is the bane of my mobile existence.
            I'll never buy skins, but the thin wingman skin definitely increases visibility. It's the opposite effect for some skins too like the legendary r99 with the tube decreases visibility.
        Omg that sounds so unfair I’m want to make a meme about it I’m so mad
            Don't forget to call it gambling.  Even though gambling implies you can actually win something.  If you go to a store and buy a grab bag, or order a monthly lootbox,  you're not gambling, you're purchasing random garbage.
                Wrong, let’s say you have 100 different unique items and you could buy a box and there’s 4 different tiers;
65 of the items have a 50% chance,
20 of the items have a 25% chance,
10 of the items have a 20% chance,
and then the remaining 5 items have a 5% chance

When you buy it it’s not at complete random, you know all the items you are able to get and you know the different tiers and rarity you are gambling that you get the rare items
                    You'll notice I didn't say "completely random" I said random. Your comment proves it's random.  You literally listed the percentages for the random chance. You even used the word "chance" multiple times. 

Look I can do it too: If you play [Pai Gow Poker optimally](https://wizardofodds.com/games/pai-gow-poker/) you have a 30% chance of winning, a 40% of pushing, and a 30% chance of losing.  Therefore the game isn't random, because you know all of the outcomes.
                    Can you sell the rare items, or trade them somehow?
    They're purely cosmetic. They're crying about nothing
        People act like they care about "gambling problems" or "targeting children" when they actually don't care about either of those things and are just crying that they can't get something shiny
            Hahahaha exactly! All of sudden these gamers care about the poor kids!! Brings a tear to my eye lol
        It blows my mind people are freaking out this much about cosmetics. This is the whole point of them! To make the devs money without impacting the gameplay. I've got like 150 hours into this game ill for sure throw them a couple bucks. If you get a dope skin then great! 

This feels like a prime pick your battles moment.
            The principle behind charging only for cosmetics is good. No one is disagreeing with you for that. What people are annoyed about is the cost of these skins, the horrible battlepass progression, the lack of incentive to actually pay for any of it. We want the game to do well just like you, but how are we supposed to want to pay for any of this if the rewards are slowly dripped to us and aren't even cool anyway? Too many bland weapon and character skins, too many banners tags and things no one cares about thrown into the lootbox pool and battlepass progression, etc. No one is going to keep buying the battle passes at this rate and the game will die financially and lose dev support unless something changes. That is entirely seperate of how many people are playing F2P.

I bought the first battlepass primarily because I wanted to support the game. I didn't purchase the second battlepass, and after looking at the rewards and progression issues not being fixed, I'm honestly glad I didn't waste my money.
                I guarantee you the devs are hyper aware of the average spend per player, and they also have much more data to try to maximize that.

All the complaints just come off as whining about things being too expensive.

This post is pretty frustrating because devs have come a long way with offering f2p games without pay to win, and we should applaud that instead of make it synonymous with expensive cosmetics.

If you like the game but the cosmetics are too expensive, just keep playing and don't buy them. It's that easy.
                    The issue with what you're saying is different companies have a different mindset on what "maximizing profits" means. Companies like EA that just want to make as much money as they safely can will almost always opt for making as much money in the short term as they possibly can, regardless of how it might damage the longevity of the game. 

Companies that actually want a long lasting game understand that even if they aren't maximizing their short term gains, they can make more money in the long run by not screwing their player base.

I agree with your last point, but it's a stupid point to argue. If no one buys the cosmetics, the game fucking dies. That's why people complain dude. People WANT to spend money on this game. I think you need to change your perspective a little bit. Have you seen gaming culture in the past 10 years? People literally beg companies to give them more reasons to throw their money at the game. It's insane. 

People are mad because the game doesn't really reward you in a significant way for spending money. This is the kind of system that targets whales and leaves the rest of the community feeling like if they can't drop large sums of money on the game then it's not worth spending any money at all.
                        I agree that there are different strategies to maximizing profits. I don't know a ton about the industry, but I would think short term is preferable when games can easily be replaced by the next hot thing and become outdated after a few years.

Regardless, I don't see any "screwing" of the player base. I see cosmetics that aren't worth the price tag, and that's understandable. No one needs these items, so if you don't see the value in them, then don't buy them.

General price theory says it's easier to drop prices than raise them, but also higher price items can become a status symbol. Personally, I think fortnite did this right (maybe intentionally, maybe by accident) and Apex isn't getting it right.

If it was really just about supporting the game, they could just throw up a "donate" button. But it's not just about that, it's feeling entitled to good paid content. I get it, I would love good paid content that I thought was worth it. At the same time, if it's not there then I'm happy to enjoy the game for free.
                            >. I don't know a ton about the industry, but I would think short term is preferable when games can easily be replaced by the next hot thing and become outdated after a few years.

Look at DotA, League, WoW. They are industry Giants and it's because of two things imo: they got there early, and they made an effort to be better than their competitors. Right now we're in the battle Royale era and its still super early. Fortnite has definitely locked a spot as one of the top 3 battle royales for the next 10 years or more if they don't fuck it up. That is long term profit right there and you can see how their battle pass really supports the game. The rewards are worth it and it entices players to spend money and feel like it was money well spent. 

If you ask me, there's still an empty spot for top 3 battle royales, and Apex should be taking that spot and milking it for the next 10 years right along fortnite. But looking at what's available for purchase in Apex, there's nothing worth spending money on, and the few things that seem pretty cool require way too much investment to get. Maybe you personally believe that that's okay, it's just optional shit, I feel similarly if I'm being honest. But the game needs revenue to succeed.

>If it was really just about supporting the game, they could just throw up a "donate" button. But it's not just about that, it's feeling entitled to good paid content

I didn't say that it's "just about supporting the game". I think you've misunderstood me. When I said that people WANT to spend money on the game, I didn't mean that it was out of the goodness of their hearts and they want to make the devs smile. I meant that when people play a game they really like, they want to invest in it. For a lot of people that investment is time, and a lot of other people that investment is money. They want to take their money and buy in game shit that looks or feels cool as fuck and show off to their friends. There is actually a large number of gamers nowadays whose biggest motivator in games is making their characters look pretty. These people are not getting what they want and they will quit and the game will take a hit for it
            "a couple bucks"?
Have you seen the Iron Crown store?
            But the reason why people are complaining is because it’s not just a few bucks and it’s usually not dope at all.
                I know someone that has spent nearly 500 on rocket league.  For different wheels, they spent money. 

I paid 20 for the game and after playing it for over a year, tossed them $20 to open some of the hundreds of bins I accumulated. 

Apex, haven't even spent a penny on that game yet. Never will. There is no reason to. Let the suckers keep the game alive.
                    I've probably spent around 500 bucks on Rocket League.  My inventory is probably worth about 700 bucks if I really tried hard to sell it.

But I really love the game and have enjoyed building my sets and trading around.  It's not as fun to trade or open crates any more but I have no regrets.

I'll spend money on cosmetics if the game is fun and the skins are cool.  I don't see the problem.
            People that aren't freaking out just don't care enough to realize how much of a BS system this is.

There's over 700\*3 cosmetics in the packs. We can get 45\*3 for free by lvl 100, and then none are available except for the BP ones. Furthermore, a guranteed legendary is every 30 boxes. This means unlucky players can get 1 legendary.

Their only option to get more is to either pay, or make a new account, which is stupid.

If you have lootboxes, they should be possible to obtain through grinding like crazy, so even if people are unlucky, they can obtain everything they wanted.  
If you have limited lootboxes, then there should be a store where players can always spend free currency on various cosmetics at high prices, so that even if the lootbox lottery is unkind, they can obtain some of the cool shit they actually wanted.

Mathematically, a casual player would take years to obtain everything, and people will always be willing to pay to avoid grinds. People aren't saying Apex should make no money, people just want the game to not be so fking greedy.
                I would have spent money on apex by now if I wasnt going to get ripped off spending it.
                I agree its set up poorly. But I feel the community can calm down over exaggerating the problem. It should feel good for casual players. You should be able to earn rewards that feel good when you get them. Pride and acxomplishment. Haha. I feel like this sub is beyond constructive critisism towards the developers at the moment and diving into a hateful circle jerk. 

I do agree though they feel lack luster and not worth the cost. For me personally its just cosmetics so "meh" game is still fun. 9/10. Extra 1 would come from fixing this sort of stuff you are talking about.
            Right? They released an awesome FREE game.

I get that some things are too pricey, but then just don’t buy them.
            People that have had access to the internet their entire lives seem to think everything on the internet should be free.
        It's not crying about nothing, $7 is just a ridiculous price when you don't even know what you're buying...

They'd make a lot more money if they just let you buy a skin off your choice outright for $7. Instead, they're preying on people with gambling addictions to milk a small amount of people for more money per person.
            I just wish I had the choice between paying 5$ for random shit or 10$ for exactly what I want. Shit I once bought a 30$ skin in League of Legends, I don't care, but I'm not paying for rng. I'm not mad, I'm disappointed. I want to contribute to a game I love and get some cool stuff in exchange, but this model is disgusting beyond anything else seen elsewhere in the industry.
            So kinda like fortnite? I know it's hated but their system in terms of microtransactions is probably the best out there by far. Their seasonal thing also includes currency as tiers so it's entirely possible to keep buying next passes just based off the rewards you get.

Haven't played in a year but I rmbr each pass included as much as 1600 e bucks in tiers (easy to obtain bc challenges are pretty fair) or whatever they are called and a new pass only cost 1000. So in a few seasons ,u could build up to buy a rare skin that appears in their shop
    Yep, this is just whiny bullshit from kids
    It’s all cosmetic. People are overreacting.
can't have no broke bitches in my squad
    Hide your money y’all it’s smellin like broke in here

Don't you think $1 per supply bin is a bit cheap? Should probably be more around like 700 AC, then you can buy whatever's in there.
    100 only unlocks the bin, you pay 200 per each item once opened. That way if you get a junk bin, they still got 100 from you. Take all three items and boom, 700 AC.
Clever...
    This is the same joke gamers have been regurgitating for years.
        Sorry I don't think you grasped my subtle sarcasm with my "..." But that's ok it was super subtle
            Sarcasm detection costs 4.99 extra
                Clever...
                Still the same joke

All the people bitching about other people bitching: as soon as people stop complaining about stuff like overpriced cosmetics, EA will step up their game.

Bitching at Devs and Publishers keeps them at least a little honest. 

Why would you complain about players bitching? Worst case scenario nothing happens, best case scenario, devs recognise complains and adjust prices.

Very confused about what the benefit of players NOT voicing their opinion is.
    Superiority boomer complex, reverse virtue signalling if you will. 

They love to show how much they don't care and will always use a combination of the words "kids"/"bitch"/"whine" etc without using any actual argument.
More like "Hold square for a *chance* to open for 200€
Yeah I get it’s a joke but they haven’t put any competitive advantages behind a paywall. It’s all merely cosmetics, nothing that affects gameplay.
    ["It's just cosmetic"](https://youtu.be/Ce5CDrq4dGg) is an incredibly weak argument for having pricing this egregious.
        I’m not in a place where I can watch the video, but from what I can gather his argument is something like “cosmetics are a part of one’s enjoyment of the game”? Is that correct?

If so, I agree that they can be a part of one’s enjoyment of a game. However, no one would argue that they are more essential than say gameplay elements or maintaining of competitive balance, right? Because this is a free game, it means that their funding comes from somewhere, and if overpriced cosmetics purchased by whales is the most profitable and effective way for them to continue providing a completely free game, and updating it with new map elements, characters, and weapons, then I think that most people should be on board with that.
            Farming whales may be the most profitable way to keep a free game running, but it's far from ethical. Not all whales are people with disposable income. A lot of them are people with addiction problems when it comes to stuff like this.
EA are not far from this
    "hey kiddo, want a free purple armor in your next 10 matches? Just but the bundle for only 3.000 apex coins"
        Is that how every dude I've fought in solos so far has purple armor?
            Hell even in squads it always feels like the first time we get jumped they always have super loot and we are stuck with nothing
                That’s because you don’t remember all the squads you dusted while you had super loot
    “Players can wait for the timer-based option creating an exciting aspect of gameplay where you defend the chest till it opens. Adding an instant option for in-game currency is simply a matter of expanding player choice.”

- EA, probably
        Spot on lol
    Isn't it just cosmetics? This is radically different
        It is but EA BAD, can’t upset the circlejerk
    Because they charge money for skins that don't affect gameplay? K /r/im12andiamsmart
        Right? I get the outcry over this event cuz it’s pretty bullshit, but it’s just cosmetics. The actual gameplay is free and that’s not gunna change.
    EA did virtually this with the battlefront beta
"Arc star going ou- oh wait nvm I'm low on coins."
*Laughs in Black Ops 4*
Respawn's response;

"Shots fired, aand they're hittin' me!"
At Xbox home screen... “spend 100 coins to turn apex legends on?”
To be fair, the $18 skins in the store from the start should have been an obvious sign that their prices were always going to be shit. Their greed isn't new or surprising.
    Dude they’re so greedy they made this game and didn’t charge anyone to play it. What scumbags.
        Scumbags is being nice. They made some awesome new skins that don’t change anything in game and I’m not forced to buy them. This is a fucking outrage!!!

Lol the internet has zero chill
It costs 100 missionary positions?
I could see them adding rare loot crates around the map that glow gold and you have to pay 100 apex coins to open them hoping you get a gold chest armor lmao
It's a joke ffs no need to shill here boys
We should all just stop playing? Maybe to show them some impact.
    I hate to joke about unionizing (big capitalist), but should we unionize?
Gotta love EAs suprise mechanics
Take this shit down before they see it.
SMH this is clearly fake

EA would be wanting more than 100 Apex coins
*opens to find it’s all attachments for guns you don’t have\*
You guys are such babies, stop shitting on the devs for something they most likely have zero control over. They’re cosmetics that have zero effect on gameplay, they’re meaningless. If you don’t like the prices don’t buy, it’s simple. This community is such shit that all you will find on the front page is a bunch of adult children crying like it’s the end of the world because they can’t get a bunch of fucking cosmetics, and now you’re joking like they’re going to make the game p2w. Grow the fuck up.
    >stop shitting on the devs for something they most likely have zero control over

what
    Honestly, the bfv sub is WAY more whiny, with people constantly posting "wAh maH ruSSianS? Wah mah acCurAte uNifOrmS??" Along with "I've been a long time bf vet and.....". I gotta admit, at least here its not constant crying
        They get a little whiny there but some of the anger is a bit justified. Compared to prior Battlefield games there's been a tiny amount of map and content releases.
        " it's so disrespectful to add women to this fight. It has nothing to do with being sexists! It's just disrespectful to what actually happened!"

Said the man child playing a game for pure entertainment and joy that re enacts some of the absolute darkest hours of humanity. Where they take joy in smashing an axe into a guys face, or carpet bombing an area or lighting them on fire or caving a guys skull in with a mace. Just for the pure entertainment of it. As if that's "respectful" to those to lived through those horrors. 

 As if it were supposed to be some kind of fucking documentary. 

Fucking idiots.
I haven't played in a while, are microtransactions even worst than first season?
    It’s been about the same until this new event. New loot boxes that cost $7 each and have a 50% change of getting 1 out of 24 items I believe, and you have to get all of them through these loot boxes in order to be able to purchase the new bloodhound heirloom for $35.
        No, you are guaranteed one item from the collection. And the packs contain only one event item. It will take 24 packs to complete the set. With 2 available for free, it would take $154 to complete the set, plus an additional $35 for the heirloom.
        You pay enough money on surprise mechanics to feel pride and accomplishment at the fact you get to pay another 35 for a weapon?
RemindMe! 3 Months

I'm going to blame you for this when EA actually implements it.
lmfao are y'all still crying over cosmetics?
    I just don’t buy them unless I use crafting materials. I still like the gameplay.
    When did Apex Legend’s cosmetics get to be so good that they merited this much gnashing of teeth over their pricing? EA must be doing a great job if these people want these skins so badly. Obnoxious children.
        lol they should all go play Barbie Fashion Show if they care about cosmetics so much.
        Maybe it's part of the plan.  Sell some to whales at a high price, then lower the price due to consumer demand and sell a bunch more.  Its Econ 101 to want people to pay the highest price for an item that they are willing to pay.
    Buddy, it's the principle of the matter. You can't let people or companies fuck with you cause it's "not that big a deal". 

Today it's cosmetics, tomorrow it's exclusive guns. Then it's a subscription, if you really want to play that badly. 

"Then I just won't play anymore"
Congratulations. The game was ruined for you and you didn't say shit when you had the chance.
        I think his whole point is, it is just cosmetics. If they did start making you pay for exclusive guns, it would be bullshit.

        The game does work?
            He means they need to fix the bugs. Those bugs are rather annoying, especially when it crashes mid game, or sends your squadmates into a game but not you.
    lol That's exactly what they're doing, fornite kids crying about cosmetics that don't affect gameplay. The IQ level in this sub is getting lower and lower
        [deleted]
Unpopular opinion but development costs money and a free to play game only has microtransactions to pay for it.

Want more content? It costs money.

Wow players have been paying $16/mo for years. Add that up and then add in cosmetic pieces. We don't have to own everything. You're paying for those things. Stop acting entitled to loot that required someone's time and creativity. You do not deserve everything just because it exists.
    No one is arguing that though. Why can't we just straight up buy the skin instead? Why do I have to put money into a slot machine in hope that I get something? 

People trash fortnite all the time, but at least their monetization is fair, even if its expensive.
    [deleted]
        They aren't paying to play dick is my point. They get that for free. They are not entitled to cosmetic items. What is so hard about that? We shouldn't assume it's a slippery slope. Further, they have data and we have anecdote.
    League of legends is also free to play. People are forgetting that lootboxes aren't the only way to make money.
    Yes, but wow says pay me an extra 20 bucks and get this shiny mount instead of give me 20 bucks and I'll give you a box with random crap and a small chance of getting that shiny mount.  They dont make me gamble for a nice cosmetic I might want, they put a price on it and say here it is.


Edit: missed a letter
For a minute I thought this was real. I was scared because I love playing this game. This change would of course make me stop playing!
[deleted]
Hey guys sorry but I haven’t played apex for a while so I’m not up to date . What sort of dick move did they do ?
literally EA what does anybody expect
respawn will reaaaaaally feel this. good job getting this post trending man.
Quit giving them ideas
I'm not up to date what did EA do to Apex now?
Instead of the store being coins to purchase skins it will be a bidding system. 4k coins for Mozambique skin
Yo this is fucking brutal
That is cheap for ea.... How much does the loot inside cost??
Honestly should’ve seen it coming with EA being in charge
Here pretty soon it’ll be pay to get into a game
Pay to win tactics
EA and/or Respawn fucked up this time round.
I don’t play apex, but I recognize EA when I see it
That AC premium currency icon thing looks like stick figures fucking.
Don’t give them ideas
EA is bad.
“I dont get why everyones so upset?! Our profits are up 23.5% so people are buying them but somehow everyone is angry?!”  Said every analyst at EA ever.
When u let EA touch ur game
lol it turns into csgo where you buy guns at the start, but you use real money instead
"Your teammate has delivered your banner to the Respawn Beacon. Respawn? 100 Apex Coins."
    200 Apex coins to respawn on the spot, no need to go anywhere.
I've never played this and I understood the meme instantly. Says a lot about the state of gaming these days :(
Would u like to buy 100 coins for $59.99?
Oh no, now you’re giving EA ideas 😆
DAMN IT YOU EA !
Imagine complaining about overpriced cosmetics in a f2p game
surprise mechanics!
It probably just have a mozambiqe
This is weird
This EA bad circlejerk is insane. It's cosmetics get over yourselves
    tHeY aRe cHarGiNg uS mOnEy fOr oPtiOnAl eVeNt bAsEd cOsMeTiCs wTf ea worst company ever?????
I seriously hope Respawn/EA are getting the picture here 😂. I don't doubt for a second Respawn has read a lot of the feedback and are kicking themselves but we all know for sure this wasn't a choice made by Respawn. EA pls let's change this monetary bullshit.
    It’s a free game with no purchasable advantage... cry more please
Except the microtransactions don’t have anything to do with gameplay so probably not.
    Can’t take a joke eh ?
        It’s just not a great or original joke.
DON'T GIVE THEM IDEAS
EA ssssstrikes again!
The EA side is taking over
I’m just mad they have the audacity to make prices this high when their game works 60% of the time.
why are people angry can i get an explination?
    Ea bad
And out there, somewhere, is a dev who is thinking it isn't a bad idea.
For the casual player who does not have time to loot the field just spend money and jump out the plane fully kitted only $10 for a 2 day pass.
Y’all are overreacting. The only thing in this whole game you have to pay for is cosmetics. The whole game and all the weapons are free
Literally not even close. They are all cosmetic, stop your bitching. No one cares
I'm almost certain Mr. Krabs is the CEO of EA
To get 3 common shields
The gaming community, almost every time an EA game has been hyped for the past decade: 

"Guys, EA is a terrible publisher. Do not preorder this game, and don't reward them by purchasing MTX. They'll just cash it in as hard as they can and then watch the game fall off the map. It's happened fifty times before. Please."

Players, every time: 

"No, this is different! It's [game]! I know EA is bad but I mean come on it's [game]. All my friends are getting it."

Players, a little while later: 

"I don't feel like we got what we paid for - where is all this stuff we were promised? The game looked so good in the ads. Oh, they say they're going to give us the game we paid for *and more* in the big patch, sweet. I guess I can buy a skin or two."

Players, weeks later: 

"That update was really lukewarm. It doesn't even get the game up to the level it should have been on release. Oh well, I've grown to like the game quite a bit despite its flaws even if I wouldn't pay full price for it. Wait, why are EA trying to squeeze more money out of the game now?! Don't they know it's just holding on?!"

Players, when they can't deny it any more: 

"How could this have happened to us? I can't believe how shitty EA is being. I don't understand how their business is successful when they pull shit like this. Oh well, there's this sweet new game coming out soon - it looks sick. I am totally preordering this one."

The gaming community: 

"That's an EA game, don't preorder it!"

And so on......
I always wonder about the people who "fight for justice" actually have spent more than 60.00 on the free game.  No way of honestly knowing but I'd highly suspect a huge portion of the "dont stand for this" crowd have barely spent a dime on a free game with updates.
This is a free game after all, they have to add this feature to make money people
Don't give them ideas! Delete!
We get it already.  Y’all Just being stingy about it at this point
i wouldn't be surprised at all if EA adopted this. it seems like something they would do :/
Call of Duty already has this in Blackout
If i'm not wrong this is a feature in Blackout.
Haha get it cuz it's not like for the past day every post has been complaining about overpriced and optional packs.
Random box 2.0?
Well it was bound to happen. Just like EA's other games
Don't you put that evil into the universe. you delet this righntow
Can someone tell me how EA has started fucking up this game I haven’t played it in a long time.
    They haven’t, they just put a lot of cosmetics behind expensive packs. Everything else with gameplay is good as usual.
Don’t give them anymore ideas!
Cursed image
"Alright who's opening up the first door?"
PLZ DON’T GIVE THEM IDEAS.
That's so true
LMAO
That's a little fucking harsh. I'm sure they'd at least give you an option to purchase the guns inside afterwards.
Me: Man apex is awesome
Later
Me: I’m poor I have to use fist now ;-;
Dont gibe them ideas
Now that’s funny
I'm tired of all the bitching...buy this is funny
Please don’t give them ideas.
Oh, this is from the upcoming Apex Mobile title, Apex Infinity?
Yooo what is Happening with this game, I haven't played in forever
did i miss something?
# Wait, you can open it with a trebuchet?!
DON'T GIVE THEM IDEAS!
People should just be glad we arent like cod having to pay for the best weapons with real money through rng loot boxes, at least cosmetics dont change gameplay
And you will still find a thermite grenade, arc star, 3x zoom optics and a syringe in there
Can someone give a quick run down of what's going on. Haven't been paying attention
You know that container about to have one thermite nade too.
I see more memes of microtransactions in apex.. what is going on?
one joke
I played this game on release for a month, haven’t played since. Now I see all this negative opinions? Did something change in prices or something?
[deleted]
    It’s not just because they are overpriced. It’s because you can’t choose what you want to buy, and they are overpriced. Spend 7 dollars for a 1/24 chance of the item you want. The other dude commenting doesn’t understand that part. All of these people are very willing to pay for the amazing skins they did, but don’t want to gamble up to ~$150 to get the one item they wanted.
Unpopular opinion: people are focusing so much on the price of the event because Solo Mode is actually fun
Am I an idiot for actually thinking this is a genius idea? Yes yes i am
Anyone thinking EA wouldnt do this from the start was delusional
don't give me anxiety omg
What happened I thought everybody loved this game lol
I'm not putting another dollar into Apex. There's too much uselessness to currency. I've been over level 100 and it still takes forever to earn an Apex  pack. Then they add a bunch of cool stuff that I can't obtain through gameplay mixed with some I can all behind a now 4th fucking currency. 

Stop. Once Iceborne drops I'm likely done with Apex in general cause then Pokemon then Cyberpunk. I'm just tired of it as are my friends that play. Which is sad cause I love the game.
Been out of the loop. What caused the r/gaming side of this sub to RISE UP against ea?
The sad thing is that I could actually see this happening eventually
They do have skins in the store though. Might not be the one you'd want but it's there. It's just cosmetics to me imo. It's a free game. And they give you packs til u level cap. They've gotta make money somehow right?
Lol
Nope, Shut down the game. Players will stop playing....
Haven’t played apex in months. Did they fuck with the monetization system or something?
Apex legends is one of the only games published by EA that docent require an arm and a leg to enjoy the game unless you consider paying 750 coins to fast track unlock a new legend but you’ll still be able to unlock all 4 legends by the time you hit lv.85.
I'm out of the loop what did they do? Haven't played the game in quite a while

Hey /u/designty,


This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
🤣 damn this is a good one
Some people here criticize that people complain about prices of cosmetic items in a f2p game. How would you react if games cost 200$ tomorrow or the next ps5 cost 1000$ but the hardware is only worth 400$. Because a game is f2p doesnt mean you cant complain about overblown prices of a digital product which the cosmetics items are. That the game is f2p is of no interest when the product are the cosmetics. I dont even mention the predatory behaviour against people who get easily addicted to gambling, which ea knows about.
I will will quit if that happens
Currently watching the tournament with its 45 minute breaks in between matches....yay?
Im out of touch with the game, what happened ??
The little logo looks like stick people fucking in missionary.. getting fucked much?
I don't get it. I was thinking about getting into apex, but the recent memes seem to indicate that would be a foolish choice.
I just hope they don't do what BO4 did and put new weapons behind a paywall/rng luck
Fuck apex 😂😂
Got damn
I like how everybody attacks on devs and EA 😂 i hope they will remember this.
So I’m a little out of the loop here, why is everyone unhappy with apex?
Did they add some pay2win thing or something
That would be the end of apex legends if they did that lol
Wait, what's happening? I'm completely out of the loop.
Hey on ps4 if you press down d button they trash talk neat!
EA dtands for:eat shit
I don't play Apex but I am curious what this is about. Can anyone explain?
gonna need to have killcams in Apex
I’m on my phone looking at this and the app just crashed. I assume that is the future update of Apex too.
How many of you play this game honestly? Just wondering
lmfaooooooooo
Is this for reals
Thats why the Apex Coin logo is a person ontop of another...its EA f***ing its players
This is Apex Legends since near the end.
I hope with the bottom of my heart this is fake
> A lot of people in that screenshot
The fact you have to pay real money just to buy a skin with ingame money was already a major red flag yet everyone dismissed it.
Oh God no
Aaaaaaaand a blank screen a couple days later because nobody will play anymore
If you didn’t see an EA published game getting loot boxes.....


I don’t know what to tell ya
Lots of people defending this ridiculous pricing in this thread. These people are the reason AAA games have gotten so egregious with their monetization.
Yall laught but this is already in blackout.
This just reminds me of how somebody posted about how a bug lead to supply bins appearing black, and some of the comments suggested that those types could contain higher-level items. To be honest, I wouldn't be surprised if EA did something similar to this.
They really need to respond this issue soon. This isn't the sort of shitstorm you can just ignore until the online whining stops. This shit will drive away a lot of players solely on principle. I never planned to spend any money on this event anyway, but depending on how they handle their response, i might quit playing altogether. I'm at least giving them the chance to respond and fix this before I give up on Respawn entirely.
Could somebody explain the current issue with Apex? I played back when it launched but stopped cuz I got busy. Is Apex trying to make it pay to play?
"It's just cosmetics!"
But man, it is also part of the game, it's so sad that it's almost impossible of getting what you want without paying.
Here in Brazil those loot boxes are so expansive... It almost takes away the fun of the game because I also want to wear some nice cosmetics...

            They already do it, you have to spend money to unlock the seasonal ability to spend money on the seasons rewards
    Anytime someone comments on something cool I pick up, I am quick to mention I have paypal and Apple Pay
That's when I leave. Only reason I still play is the packs are only cosmetic.
    Same.  I think that's the big barrier between what is okay as far as a money grab and what is not.  Pay to win is enough to spoil even the best game for me.
        There are bigger implications to this though. For instance, in kids schools these days, *default* is a derogatory slur for someone who can't afford skins. Think of all the kids out there spending their entire allowance on fucking *slot machines* in order to increase their social status.  
That there is fucked up. And now they want to charge $7 per pack. Fuck right off.
            My kids call me a default..
                My dude .. take a seat.
                Oooffff
                F
                My friends have like the most  expensive looking skins in cs:go and other games, and I always get the skins no one really wants, the ones that look military or just normal cause I hate unrealistic shit...  


I think my collection of skins worth 2€ is better than the 100€ funky color skins =D
                    I've never bought a Fortnite skin, hence, me being a default.
                You look that little shit dead in the eye and call him a Rust Lord.
                Mine too
                Trade the kid in for skins
            That is fucked up.  But unfortunately kids can be that way.  

Just playing devils advocate, if there wasn't a system to purchase these cosmetic items, how could the game survive other than ad revenue? Keep in mind I'm pretty new to gaming so theres a chance I'm missing a big part of the industry.
                The skins could be directly for sale. That's how it worked for the longest time. Now you have to draw the right skin at random.
                    Ah, I missed the importance placed on "slot machines".  Yes. Fucked up.
                        Example: Fortnite.  Rotating shop inventory. Everyone can buy the items when they're in the shop.
                            People get excited to see what's going to be on rotation the next day. Still a form of behavioral manipulation, but not the kind approved by Satan.
                    And at the very least, if we're gonna do this loot box shit, make it so you can't get duplicates *whatsoever.*
                        I thought Apex loot boxes don't give duplicates?
                            They dont.
                    that wouldn't stop the kids from spending tons of money and mocking the kids who dont...
                        It basically does. I don't remember league of legends having problems like that. Once you can just buy a specific skin from a list, it's not really special that you have it.
                True but I'm pretty sure introducing children to gambling and then preying on their ignorance is immoral if not illegal.   Should kids be able to play slots in Vegas?  The problem everyone has here is the loot box mechanic
                    Can I be frank? I never understood the issue with loot boxes until, your post. Taking advantage of kids is absolutely evil and manipulatice yet I've always seen it in terms of adults
                    Pokemon cards coming in booster packs is essentially the same concept.

Random chance to get something of value.
                        I would argue that trading card games are pretty scummy as well. They always become a game of who has more money to buy more cards. Bad systems are bad, whether other things are ALSO bad doesn't make a difference.
                        I always see this argument come up on lootbox discussions and it’s...a pretty good one lol
                            The argument against it is that you're getting a physical item that can be sold on the second-hand market.
                        >booster packs

Difference is physical ownership and the ability to retain market value. Booster pack card can be resold/bought individually and the buyer retains the option to list market value. Electronic goods from loot boxes have no physical ownership (only license to use) to you and there is no market value for the purchaser to retain. IE: The host of the game could shut the game down and "your" electronic goods go with it with no recourse to retain purchases.
                        It's 2nd hand market but I can buy a specific card and nothing is violating terms. Not a fan of trading card games either though, even with that.
                That’s why my kid will take martial arts lessons so anyone that tries to default him can get eliminated.
                    Make sure your kid isn’t wearing the default gi & belt.
                It couldn’t possibly survive without at least “game breaking” ads (imagine watching a 30 second ad after legend selection [LOL]). 

However, they could take little to no hit by making mtx reasonably priced, from increased sales
                I think the issue is that these 20 skins or whatever they are for JUST the iron crown event cost significantly more than a regular game, but apex has significantly less actual game content than that. If the game had more content or the skins cost significantly less it wouldn’t be as much of an issue. But they’re trying to coax people into spending insane amounts of cash on cosmetic items just because the game was “free to play” even though the gameplay content just isn’t there. The game remains mostly stagnant with a few gameplay add ons here and there, but nothing even close to a triple A title you would only pay $80-$120 for. And I shutter at the fact that $80-$120 for a game is something I’m following the word “only” with.
            Growing up didn't the kids do the same thing in regards to clothing, such as name brand clothes vs whatever else?  The medium might have changed but kids mocking the disparity of wealth hasn't and most likely won't ever change.
                The big differentiation being that those kids can at least buy the exact piece of clothing they want. They don't go to the clothing store to find a guy with all the clothes behind the counter who asks for money, puts on a blindfold and chucks 3 random things in the kids face.
                That's true man.  I had rebock pump knock offs and got mocked for them.  But they still shouldn't be introducing kids to gambling.
            I agree with you but the analogy isn’t great, kids are going to spend their allowance on shit to impress their friends no matter what, this gen it happens to be game skins, when I was a kid it was CD’s or band shirts. They’re kids without jobs it’s not like they’re saving up for retirement
            Kids these days don't know the sheer joy of stomping a blinged out server with nothing but default skins and stock weapons while saying nothing in chat.

It makes people so angry for no good reason.
            Grown man here, is this really a thing? 'Default' as an insult?
        I'll put some money into the game because of how much I enjoy it and want to support, but if it ever becomes pay to win I'm gone.
        Micro transactions always make me think of that line from the last DJ. "while all the boys upstairs see how much you'll pay for what you used to get for free." I think micro transactions are unethical as fuck because it's basically gambling.
    I quit Clash Royale because they did a huge money grab and introduced a monthly sub.

The P2W before that was absolutely there, but much more restrained.
Hey can you open this supply bin for me I don’t get paid till next week.

Paywall behind a paywall
    Isn’t that what the bloodhound cosmetic is?
        Yep
        [removed]
            Yep
        100% I'm not even mad just what I expected from EA tbh
    Wait that's illegal
American Eagle makes games now?
Tf is ae
    EAs weird uncle
What are you talking about? Nobody saw that coming!
    We were blindly hopeful. But we all knew this would happen sooner or later
        Isn’t it just cosmetics? I’m truly confused as to why people are upset about a free game having cosmetics needing to be purchased.
            It’s not that.. it’s like a slot machine.. you might get 1 of 5 items.. maybe the one you want maybe not.. you’re guaranteed to get it after 5 tries or $20.. which ever come first
                That’s not that insane. Lots of games have skins that cost a lot. It’s cosmetics that literally don’t matter at all. It’s a first person game, you can’t see them. The people who are shooting at you aren’t paying attention. 

I really would like to see both sides who but who gives a shit.
                    People play games for lots of reasons, and despite the fact that you personally don't care about cosmetics doesn't mean that other people don't. Like Contada said, it's not that the skins cost a lot (Which is to be expected to a degree if the game is F2P otherwise), it's the fact that you have to gamble with your money and HOPE that you eventually get the cosmetics that you want. 

I'm sure that I spent literal hundreds of dollars on skins in League of Legends, over the many years that I played that game. I was happy to pay a premium to support an otherwise-free game, to get cool cosmetics that made the experience more enjoyable for me. But every time I spent 10 or 20 bucks on skins, I *knew* what I was getting. People don't like being dicked around by gamble boxes, and having to put money into a slot machine indefinitely in the hopes that they'll get what they want. Again, it's great that you don't mind either way, more power to you, but RNG lootbox/slot-machine mechanics exist solely for the purpose of bringing in more money, not enhancing the gameplay experience at all.
        Can you explain what’s happened? Are EA forcing me to buy all these meaningless cosmetics?
            No, they're forcing their developers though to make them and to make them as enticing as possible like casino managers.
            No ones forcing you and no one said they did. Stop with the red herrings. That’s a very lazy and disingenuous way to make an argument.

What I actually said was the we all knew that EA would push these self-sabotaging, money-grabbing techniques on Respawn sooner or later. This is what they always do. They destroyed Dice and countless other studios with this bs.
            Lol no shit. I dont play apex anymore but i see all this whining on my front page when its literally just cosmetics that noone even notices. Why people buy them i have no clue. I never once noticed what cosmetics someone was wearing unless i killed them and picked up their gun.

People think "ill look so cool in that" bur seriously noone even looks at ur character long enough to make it worth any more than $1
                This is the only comment that matters in this entire thread lmao.
Love how all the good stuff = Respawn

All the bad stuff = EA
    Did you see the good monetization Respawn did with Titanfall 1 and 2 when they were still fully in control?

Free updates, affordable cosmetic items, prices that made sense, a lot of free stuff that you could earn in game.

There is just no way devs like that go to shitty practices all of the sudden like that
        Sorry, you can't compare paid games with a free to play game. That's not how it works.

Respawn has said *ad nauseam* how EA is hands off with this game. These cosmetics and prices are 100% on Respawn.
            Did you believe all that pr talk? It's even probably EA that told them to say that. Nobody wanted to have EA associated with them after the loot box disaster.

But again we're both speculating so I'll give you the benefit of the doubt
                Man I hate statements like that. 

If you don't believe the "pr talk" then wouldn't it be safe to assume that EA actually did most of the work with Respawn only helping? You can't only make assumptions that help your argument.
                    >wouldn't it be safe to assume that EA actually did most of the work with Respawn only helping?

No? Because Respawn is the developer and EA only acts as the publisher here. What does a publisher do? They decide on pricing, marketing (what needs to be said around the game), etc. So assuming EA might have encouraged Respawn to go with that statement makes sense.

I don't even understand how you could come up with Respawn only helping. Even if you did believe that, just the fact that there is so many similarities between the Titanfall games and Apex just proves it wrong
            Well, the free to play game was a financial success, while both Titanfalls weren't. Is the money obtained from Titanfall sales enough to overwhelm the money Apex did?
                TIL that a franchise that sold **14 million copies** across 2 games is not a financial success.
        I mean, the updates are still free...
        Good monetization? You mean the games that couldn't make money?
    Yes, that’s typically how it goes. Developers are the ones making the content we want. Producers are the ones putting that content behind absurd “surprise mechanics”.
People should have expected to pay for stuff as soon as they downloaded a free game. Thank god it’s all cosmetic. I don’t think they’ve done anything wrong yet
    Yeah, but the cosmetics are bit crap. The problem is that I *want* the game to be supported with cosmetics, but it's consistently a really bad deal.
        Then don't buy them
        People pay for it. The decision how much this costs isn't made arbitrarily.
            Like with all of these, it's a handful of people with spending problems. They're worth more than the rest of the population put together. I get that.

But then, because most people are just going to see gambling addict bait, of course they're going to find it pathetic.
    Tell me about it, I played counterstrike. They think this is a bad deal? Pathetic.
        That's a bad comparison, because cs skins can be sold for an absurd amount of money. Every cs skin has value. Apex skins will never have real value like that.
            Isn’t that just closer to actual gambling?
                Yup, but it's the same thing with most games with loot boxes now in the sense that you open a box that costs money for a chance at receiving something you want. Only difference is with cs you get actual value back. That's why everyone is so pissed with Respawn and EA, spending $7 PER box to get something cosmetic that doesn't even have true value is absurd.
                    Respawn has gone out of their way to talk about how this is their game and EA doesn't run the show.



It's all on Respawn
                    Here’s a suggestion. Don’t spend money on cosmetics in games. Problem solved. Moving on.
                        For a real answer: it affects the rest of us because we are no longer the customers, only the cosmetic players are customers.

Sure we may *buy* a game, but the upsell base is the real financial driver for these companies. Major publishers will continue ramp up not just the number of transactions, but the *integration* of transactions in games. 

Treading into controversial territory... From here on is absolutely my own opinion:

Unfortunately without regulation the game industry just becomes another major loss for consumers.

                My glock fade turned into $180 a few years ago. That value felt pretty real.
        Dude, I'm on your side that while it is a scummy practice, it is only for comestic items. But your comparison of downloading a free game vs Counter Strike is dumb. Up to last year, CS wasn't free, it was about 15 bucks. Then if you wanted you could buy a key that costs 2.50 bucks to open a lootcrate. If anything CS had less of an excuse because they essentially where double dipping.
            CS gave me a free skin which I then went and sold for $180. Now, I got lucky, but it wasn’t impossible to get the skins you wanted for free, and, worst case scenario, you could just buy the one you wanted from the marketplace. 

There’s no option here to buy what I want. I have to gamble with loot boxes and hope that I roll the right one. That’s the major difference. People wouldn’t be as mad if they allowed direct purchases. I hear rainbow 6 siege does that, though I don’t actually play it so I don’t know for sure, but nobody is rioting over there.
    Sure they haven’t done anything wrong yet, but players like myself are pissed because we were willing to buy this season’s $10 battle pass only to find out the skins in it were fairly lame. In comes this timed event with skins everyone wants, but it’s behind a $150 paywall, far beyond the price of two normally priced games (thus negating the argument that this pricing is just “recouping the costs of this being a F2P game”)
    I buy the battle passes because it gives me something to do and supports the developers. I feel I'm getting my money's worth. If the game really goes to shit, I won't buy them anymore. I still have no idea why people get so twisted over FUCKING COSMETICS. Don't buy them, easy. It's not like they are putting entire characters behind paywalls.
        I know! I actually thought it was pretty nice of them to allow characters to be unlocked so easily through in game play. That’s something they could’ve easily locked behind a paywall
            The in game cost to unlock legends is pretty reasonable. If you buy one battle pase, you can also grind enough by the end to buy another oass wi5h in game currency. It's still a free game. Don't like it? Don't play.
i feel like a slowpoke meme would be more apt.
It's a free game. You think they should just make games and not make any money from it at all? You people are really annoying.
    Great take, now watch as they proceed to make much less money than they could have because of a fundamental misunderstanding their playerbase demographics and how much disposable income they're willing to throw at a game like this.
        You'd be surprised how much money kids will dump into cosmetics. I have nephews who put a large portion of their gift money into skins. Over any given year, that's probably more than a half dozen AAA titles worth poured into 1 game.
            Kids spend money on dumb shit because they can and don't have bills or other things to pay for. We used to buy knockoff zippos and /r/mallninjashit-esque knives and swords at the fair just because we could. Pokémon cards, pogs, stretchy bracelets, anything we could buy for a few bucks. We bought useless shit because they were the only things we could buy, and usually because our friends had them too. This seems like a modern version of that. 

I guess I don't see how this is any different from what kids normally buy when they get a little money to throw around aside from the gambling aspect, which is shady. Card booster packs have been doing that for ages. Not that it makes either of them better or acceptable but that type of mechanic has been around for a long, long time. Other than that, it just seems like people getting pissy about a free game doing free game things.
                That's pretty true. We dumped heaps on crappy trading cards - and not just sport ones that could have value, crap like Jurassic Park trading cards.
        Reddit isn’t the average demographic of any popular games player base
            Maybe those anime dating sims
        Why do you think you know better than their analysts? Are you basing this on anything other than gut feeling?
            Because no studio under the Activision/EA banner has ever run a game into the ground before?

What about the analysts they employed at the time?
                They probably said " do this and you will make 100 million before finishing returns" and they did just that.
EA is full of this kind of shit, they already have these kind of ideas.
    Doesn't COD's blackout have something like this now? Crates during the game only players who bought the pass or whatever it's called can open. 

&#x200B;

I stopped playing that long time ago.
        Blackjack's stash 
  
And yeah you have to earn the weapons from the black market in the game to be able to open a box in blackout that can contain any of the guns you've unlocked
            OK so not quite the same. That game's gotten so crazy with the passes and loot boxes and micro transactions, I don't know how anyone keeps up.
                Honestly I only keep up bc of the subreddit. I mean I own the game, but multiplayer and blackout didn't hold up as well as I thought they would, and zombies was lackluster due to the changes they made to the perk system. I don't own the black ops pass but the fact that bo4 has the same MTX system as fortnite, just without as nice looking of skins or whatever is really bananas for a AAA title that could cost upwards of $120
                    The games 110 dollars plus all the money you have to spend to get all the guns. And of course the guns you get are random so you spend 500 bucks and still not get a single weapon and just get a fuckton of emotes and stickers
                        I really hope Modern Warfare doesn't end up doing this shit too. That game looks so promising and could honestly revive the series if they pull it off correctly. Part of me thinks they'll be able to do it but part of me knows it's still an Activision game and they'll probably do something similar to how they waited a month for reviews to come in on BO4 before they introduced tons of ridiculous microtransactions.
                            Yeah, I'm hoping IW can breathe some life back into COD with the Modern Warfare reboot, but knowing our luck I fear the game will get buttfucked by Activision
                                IW has to recover from the shitfest that was Infinite Warfare.  


MW is supposed to have no MTX.  But then again who knows
                            Exactly why I’m waiting. It’s IW we’re talking about and they aren’t sellouts like Treyarch so I doubt it’ll happen. But both the Treyarch games in the last 4 years had Treyarch and Activision saying “we will have no MTX” then a month later they release MTX and say “we need to make money somehow, there will be no pay to win MTX” then a month later we have pay to win MTX. 

When you put Activision and Treyarch in the same room together all the CoD fans are about to get assfucked
                            I have some bad news for you, friend. A lot of what Activision makes for revenue is MTX shit. They'll do it again. It worked for BLOPS4 where the game sold well initially and then they dropped in the MTX crap. They did it with Modern Warfare Remastered. They'll do it again.
                I gave up early.

Me and my friends spent so much time grinding blackout to unlock the characters by completing the in game challenges, most of which relied on luck of finding required item (if it spawned) and placing or winning the game. We got most of the characters available, and it took a lot of effort and patience. Then one day we started app, checked the store, and there were the characters we spent all that time earning. Fuck that game. There's no point in trying to earn anything in CoD because any effort is just wasted. 

Anyways, thats my story of how I gave up on black ops.
            They actually called them *Blackjack*? Ballsy move.
            I know COD's trash, and their fanbase is not the brightest... By that I just mean they dish out 60+ bucks for the same game they played last year, but why does something that is CLEARLY bullshit not call for revolt? An entire Gamemode dedicated to everyone having the same obstacles to overcome decides to have hidden guns you can ONLY get when you buy them through their market???
                Bo4 is the most egregious cash grab I have seen from Activision, bar them remastering AND reimagining the modern warfare serious. 
  
After bo3 and it's loot boxes, we got infinite warfare, which at least gave the base variant of every new weapon to owners of the season pass, and then world war 2 followed almost the exact same suit. 
  
Activision, and by extension treyarch, are fucking clods, that are spearheading a movement into gaming, where every game has a battlepass and cosmetics to buy. But the game itself is still $60
                    [deleted]
                        truly sad how treyarch did live long enough to see themselves become the villain, if only sledgehammer games wasn't the villain at the beginning with advanced warfare
                            Exactly. Were it not for Sledgehammer tossing supply drops into Advanced Warfare as well as making them purchasable with better odds, the **entire** loot box fad wouldn’t exist. I respect Sledgehammer for changing their ways with how they did things within WWII, they’re still completely to blame for loot boxes becoming a thing. No CoD had them prior to Advanced Warfare.
                    I will say this, the modern warfare remaster was a massive overhaul. Have you tried it? I also got it for free I’m pretty sure…
                > By that I just mean they dish out 60+ bucks for the same game they played last year

*[EA sports and 2k players be like](https://i.imgflip.com/2ywi2b.png)*

But seriously though, a new game every year and with Ultimate Teams kills any longevity of a sports game. I would be inclined to buy more sports game if they stayed with the game for 3 years or so before they dropped the next one. It's like as soon as they drop a game there is maybe a few months of updates and then they work on the following years game. I have no idea why anyone would want to put in time and money for ultimate teams just for it to become essentially obsolete within a year or so because the playerbase is playing the new title.
        Activision is just as bad maybe worse than EA but they seem to get a pass.  COD isn’t a free game and they do that crap.
        Lol it wouldn't surprise me. I played that game a lot till apex came out and I haven't played since. Actually downloaded some updates to try it out a few days ago and the first thing I saw on the openingb cutscene was Ruin running on a beach with one of those round floaties around his waist. So weird haha
        Jesus fucking Christ. Companies have decided to stop copying and just straight up hire Satan themselves.
    And I don’t understand why? If the skins had reasonable prices they’d be making a lot more money than they are right now. Because I highly doubt anybody is willing to pay 12 bucks for an epic skin. 

Make the epic character skins like 3-4 bucks and the epic weapon skins like 1 or 2. I’m sure a lot more people would be willing to buy a lot of skins. At least more inclined than they are now, at 12$ a pop.

I do however suspect they don’t even want you to buy the skins. The absurd prices are probably there to make you buy apex packs instead where you’ll probably not even get an epic for those 12$

> Because I highly doubt anybody is willing to pay 12 bucks for an epic skin.

Believe it. Hell, this game made over 90 million the first month. The only reason revenue dipped heavily in the 2nd month was because there was nothing new to buy.
        They're targeting the whales who are willing to spend thousands of dollars to max out their inventory. It's what devs do in mobile games. Everyone hates this model, but it makes a lot of money.
        If a free to play game has high quality skins, I'd definitely spend 12 to buy a good skin for my favourite character to support the game I love. My personal budget for free games is 50 bucks a month, and yes that usually goes to permanent cosmetic content, regardless of the price, as long as I like the skin.

    Jesus Christ that's fucked
Nothing you can purchase changes anything about the actual gameplay.
    Then why are people complaining? It is literally a free game... as long as loot boxes do not affect gameplay, I am indifferent about them. People just get upset because they spend $20 on apex coins only to not get what they wanted. Sorry, maybe spend your money more wisely.
        The majority of players don’t care. Reddit is a very vocal minority that absolutely loves a good circle jerk.
            ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) I love a good circle jerk, personally
                Same tbh family
                    Same here tho
            This place is cancer
        Been playing Apex nearly since it came out. Have not spent a dime. It's a lot of fun. I have considered paying something to basically thank the devs. That game is worth more than the $10 or $20 I will give them because I have put so many hours into that game. However, I'm thankful that no gameplay is affected by in game purchases at all, it's all purely cosmetic (like fortnight? Idk, don't play it but I think it does the same)
            I honestly feel like I should spend a few bucks here there because of how much I play it. I was never really into any battle royale games till respawn came around
        People complain because it replaces a satisfying system with a money making system
        I don’t understand either. If they had to pay to play the game, I’d get it. But it’s a FREE game. You can choose to pay for the cosmetics and it won’t give you any higher chance of winning. 

Honestly I just feel like most people complaining are just looking for something to complain about
            Because people bought the battle pass which only had 2 skins in it and it seems like all the badass skins were saved for this event. Not the main reason but uts gotta hurt for sure. So saying it's a free game is true but once you get that pass it's not free anymore.
                I bought the battle pass because it was a reaeonable cost and I spend a lot of hours there. The challenges give me something to do. I could care less about skins.
                You can see what's in the battle pass before purchase. What's the problem here?

            The slight devil's advocate here is that some of us genuinely want to spend money to support the game and enhance our experience. But they've priced out their own fans. Long term means lost revenue and support meaning the game will die quicker
            Is it wrong to expect new content, even just cosmetics, to be priced reasonably for the average consumer? There are people willing to spend up to $20 bucks for a single skin, but apparently that's not good enough for EAspawn.
        Reddit loves to complain about people wanting to make money. The vocal minority believes a free game needs to have every single thing free and the people slaving to make it shouldn’t be compensated for their hard work. And if it is completely free, they complain about ads that make money lol
        I agree, I’m not defending loot boxes and the purposeful addiction ethics.  
  
Since there is no trading system, it’s all completely overblown and I don’t think most adults care
        Honestly, how are they expecting updates to a free game if there is no microtransactions to support production? Loot boxes and rng is bullshit but if it doesn't effect gameplay, they can just not buy it.
        >Then why are people complaining? It is literally a free game... as long as loot boxes do not affect gameplay

Tell people to spend more wisely, indicating It's  a bad investment, then confused about why people are complaining.  Can't actually fathom how you can't comprehend the reason people dislike lootboxes, crazy you actually got 200 upvotes. From like minded idiots I suppose.   
Guess using your brain is too much to ask for these days.
        I think Apex is being brigaded. Easy way for Fortnite to stamp out it's competition is by stirring up a minority of child/teenage players with posts like these and lessening the popularity of Apex from within it's own community.
            Jesus, I hadn’t even looked through the subreddit recently. Almost every post is shitting on the game right now...
                It was even worse in season one lol
                    Hm, kinda goes to show you how it really is to each their own. I enjoyed the shit out of season 1 with my friends...
                        Oh, I meant that I thought the complaining on here was more prevalant back then. Seems to mostly always revolve around cosmetics. Back then that they weren't good. Now that they're good, too expensive lol.
                            Sorry I think we had some miscommunication but I am definitely agreeing with you. What I meant was it is funny that people were here bitching and morning about whatever, and meanwhile I had literally no issues with season 1. Maybe that is because I didn’t buy the battle pass.. but why buy it if you already saw the shitty rewards lmao
                                Yeah, I didnt buy it either. Picked up Titanfall 2 complete edition for cheaper than the BP and that was and is a lot of fun.
        Right. After playing for a few dozen hours at first, I was interested enough to buy packs to support the game that I've gotten so much entertainment out of and to hopefully get some neat skins. Out of like 20 crates, I got like 3 items I thought were cool. I'll never buy packs again (though I don't regret it).

This whole crate thing is stupid as fuck. It's literally gambling. It's insulting to sit there and have the slot machine tactics try to excite you with lights and presentation and then have garbage come out. Younger minds are more susceptible to these tactics and it's an irresponsible way to make money. If they offered a way to buy the skins and stuff you want specifically, I would definitely pay for that. I will not pay for the chance to hopefully maybe get it by luck.
        I don’t think it’s right to put gambling in a game but for all the people who don’t want to spend money this won’t affect them at all. I don’t keep up to date with the changes they make in this game but if it’s all cosmetic it’s pretty ridiculous to compare that to buying weapons in-game.
        Because microtransactions bad and we deserve all post-launch cosmetics for free obviously
            Because gambling is bad sir
        It’s not about the cosmetic themselves but the fact that the only way to earn these items is to pay. You can play some 500 hours of this game all you want and I’m not excusing blizzard’s practise either but at least in Overwatch you have an option to play and earn. It’s absolutely mental how Respawn hasn’t sorted this shit out. 

I just want to play and earn, not pay and burn (a hole through my wallet).
            You are playing a free game! How do you expect them to make money? The developers can't eat "hours a player put into the game" and servers don't run on love.
            Who.. the fuck.. cares?  You think they make money off of people who just play 500 hours?  No.  It's a free game.  IT'S A FREE GAME!  Honestly, you should be willing to spend money on a game that you sink 500 hours into, but it's not required.
            Boo hoo, you don't get more free stuff on top of the free game you play. What a whiner
    > changes anything about the actual gameplay. 

wont the new axe change that tho? you have a weapon on the landing
        They don’t deal any additional damage. See wraiths knife.
            ah ok, shiet im glad to hear that
    This is exactly why I don't get why people are so up in arms about the payment system. The game is free guys
    Well, some skins actually have preferable Iron sights. Not too game changing but they can make a difference for certain players.

Edit: Autocorrect is the bane of my mobile existence.
        I'll never buy skins, but the thin wingman skin definitely increases visibility. It's the opposite effect for some skins too like the legendary r99 with the tube decreases visibility.
    Omg that sounds so unfair I’m want to make a meme about it I’m so mad
        Don't forget to call it gambling.  Even though gambling implies you can actually win something.  If you go to a store and buy a grab bag, or order a monthly lootbox,  you're not gambling, you're purchasing random garbage.
            Wrong, let’s say you have 100 different unique items and you could buy a box and there’s 4 different tiers;
65 of the items have a 50% chance,
20 of the items have a 25% chance,
10 of the items have a 20% chance,
and then the remaining 5 items have a 5% chance

When you buy it it’s not at complete random, you know all the items you are able to get and you know the different tiers and rarity you are gambling that you get the rare items
                You'll notice I didn't say "completely random" I said random. Your comment proves it's random.  You literally listed the percentages for the random chance. You even used the word "chance" multiple times. 

Look I can do it too: If you play [Pai Gow Poker optimally](https://wizardofodds.com/games/pai-gow-poker/) you have a 30% chance of winning, a 40% of pushing, and a 30% chance of losing.  Therefore the game isn't random, because you know all of the outcomes.
                Can you sell the rare items, or trade them somehow?
They're purely cosmetic. They're crying about nothing
    People act like they care about "gambling problems" or "targeting children" when they actually don't care about either of those things and are just crying that they can't get something shiny
        Hahahaha exactly! All of sudden these gamers care about the poor kids!! Brings a tear to my eye lol
    It blows my mind people are freaking out this much about cosmetics. This is the whole point of them! To make the devs money without impacting the gameplay. I've got like 150 hours into this game ill for sure throw them a couple bucks. If you get a dope skin then great! 

This feels like a prime pick your battles moment.
        The principle behind charging only for cosmetics is good. No one is disagreeing with you for that. What people are annoyed about is the cost of these skins, the horrible battlepass progression, the lack of incentive to actually pay for any of it. We want the game to do well just like you, but how are we supposed to want to pay for any of this if the rewards are slowly dripped to us and aren't even cool anyway? Too many bland weapon and character skins, too many banners tags and things no one cares about thrown into the lootbox pool and battlepass progression, etc. No one is going to keep buying the battle passes at this rate and the game will die financially and lose dev support unless something changes. That is entirely seperate of how many people are playing F2P.

I bought the first battlepass primarily because I wanted to support the game. I didn't purchase the second battlepass, and after looking at the rewards and progression issues not being fixed, I'm honestly glad I didn't waste my money.
            I guarantee you the devs are hyper aware of the average spend per player, and they also have much more data to try to maximize that.

All the complaints just come off as whining about things being too expensive.

This post is pretty frustrating because devs have come a long way with offering f2p games without pay to win, and we should applaud that instead of make it synonymous with expensive cosmetics.

If you like the game but the cosmetics are too expensive, just keep playing and don't buy them. It's that easy.
                The issue with what you're saying is different companies have a different mindset on what "maximizing profits" means. Companies like EA that just want to make as much money as they safely can will almost always opt for making as much money in the short term as they possibly can, regardless of how it might damage the longevity of the game. 

Companies that actually want a long lasting game understand that even if they aren't maximizing their short term gains, they can make more money in the long run by not screwing their player base.

I agree with your last point, but it's a stupid point to argue. If no one buys the cosmetics, the game fucking dies. That's why people complain dude. People WANT to spend money on this game. I think you need to change your perspective a little bit. Have you seen gaming culture in the past 10 years? People literally beg companies to give them more reasons to throw their money at the game. It's insane. 

People are mad because the game doesn't really reward you in a significant way for spending money. This is the kind of system that targets whales and leaves the rest of the community feeling like if they can't drop large sums of money on the game then it's not worth spending any money at all.
                    I agree that there are different strategies to maximizing profits. I don't know a ton about the industry, but I would think short term is preferable when games can easily be replaced by the next hot thing and become outdated after a few years.

Regardless, I don't see any "screwing" of the player base. I see cosmetics that aren't worth the price tag, and that's understandable. No one needs these items, so if you don't see the value in them, then don't buy them.

General price theory says it's easier to drop prices than raise them, but also higher price items can become a status symbol. Personally, I think fortnite did this right (maybe intentionally, maybe by accident) and Apex isn't getting it right.

If it was really just about supporting the game, they could just throw up a "donate" button. But it's not just about that, it's feeling entitled to good paid content. I get it, I would love good paid content that I thought was worth it. At the same time, if it's not there then I'm happy to enjoy the game for free.
                        >. I don't know a ton about the industry, but I would think short term is preferable when games can easily be replaced by the next hot thing and become outdated after a few years.

Look at DotA, League, WoW. They are industry Giants and it's because of two things imo: they got there early, and they made an effort to be better than their competitors. Right now we're in the battle Royale era and its still super early. Fortnite has definitely locked a spot as one of the top 3 battle royales for the next 10 years or more if they don't fuck it up. That is long term profit right there and you can see how their battle pass really supports the game. The rewards are worth it and it entices players to spend money and feel like it was money well spent. 

If you ask me, there's still an empty spot for top 3 battle royales, and Apex should be taking that spot and milking it for the next 10 years right along fortnite. But looking at what's available for purchase in Apex, there's nothing worth spending money on, and the few things that seem pretty cool require way too much investment to get. Maybe you personally believe that that's okay, it's just optional shit, I feel similarly if I'm being honest. But the game needs revenue to succeed.

>If it was really just about supporting the game, they could just throw up a "donate" button. But it's not just about that, it's feeling entitled to good paid content

I didn't say that it's "just about supporting the game". I think you've misunderstood me. When I said that people WANT to spend money on the game, I didn't mean that it was out of the goodness of their hearts and they want to make the devs smile. I meant that when people play a game they really like, they want to invest in it. For a lot of people that investment is time, and a lot of other people that investment is money. They want to take their money and buy in game shit that looks or feels cool as fuck and show off to their friends. There is actually a large number of gamers nowadays whose biggest motivator in games is making their characters look pretty. These people are not getting what they want and they will quit and the game will take a hit for it
        "a couple bucks"?
Have you seen the Iron Crown store?
        But the reason why people are complaining is because it’s not just a few bucks and it’s usually not dope at all.
            I know someone that has spent nearly 500 on rocket league.  For different wheels, they spent money. 

I paid 20 for the game and after playing it for over a year, tossed them $20 to open some of the hundreds of bins I accumulated. 

Apex, haven't even spent a penny on that game yet. Never will. There is no reason to. Let the suckers keep the game alive.
                I've probably spent around 500 bucks on Rocket League.  My inventory is probably worth about 700 bucks if I really tried hard to sell it.

But I really love the game and have enjoyed building my sets and trading around.  It's not as fun to trade or open crates any more but I have no regrets.

I'll spend money on cosmetics if the game is fun and the skins are cool.  I don't see the problem.
        People that aren't freaking out just don't care enough to realize how much of a BS system this is.

There's over 700\*3 cosmetics in the packs. We can get 45\*3 for free by lvl 100, and then none are available except for the BP ones. Furthermore, a guranteed legendary is every 30 boxes. This means unlucky players can get 1 legendary.

Their only option to get more is to either pay, or make a new account, which is stupid.

If you have lootboxes, they should be possible to obtain through grinding like crazy, so even if people are unlucky, they can obtain everything they wanted.  
If you have limited lootboxes, then there should be a store where players can always spend free currency on various cosmetics at high prices, so that even if the lootbox lottery is unkind, they can obtain some of the cool shit they actually wanted.

Mathematically, a casual player would take years to obtain everything, and people will always be willing to pay to avoid grinds. People aren't saying Apex should make no money, people just want the game to not be so fking greedy.
            I would have spent money on apex by now if I wasnt going to get ripped off spending it.
            I agree its set up poorly. But I feel the community can calm down over exaggerating the problem. It should feel good for casual players. You should be able to earn rewards that feel good when you get them. Pride and acxomplishment. Haha. I feel like this sub is beyond constructive critisism towards the developers at the moment and diving into a hateful circle jerk. 

I do agree though they feel lack luster and not worth the cost. For me personally its just cosmetics so "meh" game is still fun. 9/10. Extra 1 would come from fixing this sort of stuff you are talking about.
        Right? They released an awesome FREE game.

I get that some things are too pricey, but then just don’t buy them.
        People that have had access to the internet their entire lives seem to think everything on the internet should be free.
    It's not crying about nothing, $7 is just a ridiculous price when you don't even know what you're buying...

They'd make a lot more money if they just let you buy a skin off your choice outright for $7. Instead, they're preying on people with gambling addictions to milk a small amount of people for more money per person.
        I just wish I had the choice between paying 5$ for random shit or 10$ for exactly what I want. Shit I once bought a 30$ skin in League of Legends, I don't care, but I'm not paying for rng. I'm not mad, I'm disappointed. I want to contribute to a game I love and get some cool stuff in exchange, but this model is disgusting beyond anything else seen elsewhere in the industry.
        So kinda like fortnite? I know it's hated but their system in terms of microtransactions is probably the best out there by far. Their seasonal thing also includes currency as tiers so it's entirely possible to keep buying next passes just based off the rewards you get.

Haven't played in a year but I rmbr each pass included as much as 1600 e bucks in tiers (easy to obtain bc challenges are pretty fair) or whatever they are called and a new pass only cost 1000. So in a few seasons ,u could build up to buy a rare skin that appears in their shop
Yep, this is just whiny bullshit from kids
It’s all cosmetic. People are overreacting.
Hide your money y’all it’s smellin like broke in here
I would love to hear this as an intro quip in Lifeline's accent.
    lol yes! Mirage might be able to pull it off too
Rather spend it on food or weed
    Can’t disagree there.
100 only unlocks the bin, you pay 200 per each item once opened. That way if you get a junk bin, they still got 100 from you. Take all three items and boom, 700 AC.
This is the same joke gamers have been regurgitating for years.

Superiority boomer complex, reverse virtue signalling if you will. 

They love to show how much they don't care and will always use a combination of the words "kids"/"bitch"/"whine" etc without using any actual argument.
["It's just cosmetic"](https://youtu.be/Ce5CDrq4dGg) is an incredibly weak argument for having pricing this egregious.
    I’m not in a place where I can watch the video, but from what I can gather his argument is something like “cosmetics are a part of one’s enjoyment of the game”? Is that correct?

If so, I agree that they can be a part of one’s enjoyment of a game. However, no one would argue that they are more essential than say gameplay elements or maintaining of competitive balance, right? Because this is a free game, it means that their funding comes from somewhere, and if overpriced cosmetics purchased by whales is the most profitable and effective way for them to continue providing a completely free game, and updating it with new map elements, characters, and weapons, then I think that most people should be on board with that.
        Farming whales may be the most profitable way to keep a free game running, but it's far from ethical. Not all whales are people with disposable income. A lot of them are people with addiction problems when it comes to stuff like this.
"hey kiddo, want a free purple armor in your next 10 matches? Just but the bundle for only 3.000 apex coins"
    Is that how every dude I've fought in solos so far has purple armor?
        Hell even in squads it always feels like the first time we get jumped they always have super loot and we are stuck with nothing
            That’s because you don’t remember all the squads you dusted while you had super loot
“Players can wait for the timer-based option creating an exciting aspect of gameplay where you defend the chest till it opens. Adding an instant option for in-game currency is simply a matter of expanding player choice.”

Isn't it just cosmetics? This is radically different
    It is but EA BAD, can’t upset the circlejerk
Because they charge money for skins that don't affect gameplay? K /r/im12andiamsmart
    Right? I get the outcry over this event cuz it’s pretty bullshit, but it’s just cosmetics. The actual gameplay is free and that’s not gunna change.
EA did virtually this with the battlefront beta
Dude they’re so greedy they made this game and didn’t charge anyone to play it. What scumbags.
    Scumbags is being nice. They made some awesome new skins that don’t change anything in game and I’m not forced to buy them. This is a fucking outrage!!!

Honestly, the bfv sub is WAY more whiny, with people constantly posting "wAh maH ruSSianS? Wah mah acCurAte uNifOrmS??" Along with "I've been a long time bf vet and.....". I gotta admit, at least here its not constant crying
    They get a little whiny there but some of the anger is a bit justified. Compared to prior Battlefield games there's been a tiny amount of map and content releases.
    " it's so disrespectful to add women to this fight. It has nothing to do with being sexists! It's just disrespectful to what actually happened!"

Said the man child playing a game for pure entertainment and joy that re enacts some of the absolute darkest hours of humanity. Where they take joy in smashing an axe into a guys face, or carpet bombing an area or lighting them on fire or caving a guys skull in with a mace. Just for the pure entertainment of it. As if that's "respectful" to those to lived through those horrors. 

 As if it were supposed to be some kind of fucking documentary. 

Fucking idiots.
It’s been about the same until this new event. New loot boxes that cost $7 each and have a 50% change of getting 1 out of 24 items I believe, and you have to get all of them through these loot boxes in order to be able to purchase the new bloodhound heirloom for $35.
    No, you are guaranteed one item from the collection. And the packs contain only one event item. It will take 24 packs to complete the set. With 2 available for free, it would take $154 to complete the set, plus an additional $35 for the heirloom.
    You pay enough money on surprise mechanics to feel pride and accomplishment at the fact you get to pay another 35 for a weapon?
I just don’t buy them unless I use crafting materials. I still like the gameplay.
When did Apex Legend’s cosmetics get to be so good that they merited this much gnashing of teeth over their pricing? EA must be doing a great job if these people want these skins so badly. Obnoxious children.
    lol they should all go play Barbie Fashion Show if they care about cosmetics so much.
    Maybe it's part of the plan.  Sell some to whales at a high price, then lower the price due to consumer demand and sell a bunch more.  Its Econ 101 to want people to pay the highest price for an item that they are willing to pay.
Buddy, it's the principle of the matter. You can't let people or companies fuck with you cause it's "not that big a deal". 

Today it's cosmetics, tomorrow it's exclusive guns. Then it's a subscription, if you really want to play that badly. 

"Then I just won't play anymore"
Congratulations. The game was ruined for you and you didn't say shit when you had the chance.
    I think his whole point is, it is just cosmetics. If they did start making you pay for exclusive guns, it would be bullshit.

No one is arguing that though. Why can't we just straight up buy the skin instead? Why do I have to put money into a slot machine in hope that I get something? 

People trash fortnite all the time, but at least their monetization is fair, even if its expensive.
[deleted]
    They aren't paying to play dick is my point. They get that for free. They are not entitled to cosmetic items. What is so hard about that? We shouldn't assume it's a slippery slope. Further, they have data and we have anecdote.
League of legends is also free to play. People are forgetting that lootboxes aren't the only way to make money.
Yes, but wow says pay me an extra 20 bucks and get this shiny mount instead of give me 20 bucks and I'll give you a box with random crap and a small chance of getting that shiny mount.  They dont make me gamble for a nice cosmetic I might want, they put a price on it and say here it is.

Ea bad
They haven’t, they just put a lot of cosmetics behind expensive packs. Everything else with gameplay is good as usual.
It’s not just because they are overpriced. It’s because you can’t choose what you want to buy, and they are overpriced. Spend 7 dollars for a 1/24 chance of the item you want. The other dude commenting doesn’t understand that part. All of these people are very willing to pay for the amazing skins they did, but don’t want to gamble up to ~$150 to get the one item they wanted.

        Bet I'm better at walking at a fence than you though.
        I dunno I’ve put up a lot of fences in my day.   What equipment did you use?

        They already do it, you have to spend money to unlock the seasonal ability to spend money on the seasons rewards
Anytime someone comments on something cool I pick up, I am quick to mention I have paypal and Apple Pay
Same.  I think that's the big barrier between what is okay as far as a money grab and what is not.  Pay to win is enough to spoil even the best game for me.
    There are bigger implications to this though. For instance, in kids schools these days, *default* is a derogatory slur for someone who can't afford skins. Think of all the kids out there spending their entire allowance on fucking *slot machines* in order to increase their social status.  
That there is fucked up. And now they want to charge $7 per pack. Fuck right off.
        My kids call me a default..
            My dude .. take a seat.
            Oooffff
            F
            My friends have like the most  expensive looking skins in cs:go and other games, and I always get the skins no one really wants, the ones that look military or just normal cause I hate unrealistic shit...  


I think my collection of skins worth 2€ is better than the 100€ funky color skins =D
                I've never bought a Fortnite skin, hence, me being a default.
            You look that little shit dead in the eye and call him a Rust Lord.
            Mine too
            Trade the kid in for skins
        That is fucked up.  But unfortunately kids can be that way.  

Just playing devils advocate, if there wasn't a system to purchase these cosmetic items, how could the game survive other than ad revenue? Keep in mind I'm pretty new to gaming so theres a chance I'm missing a big part of the industry.
            The skins could be directly for sale. That's how it worked for the longest time. Now you have to draw the right skin at random.
                Ah, I missed the importance placed on "slot machines".  Yes. Fucked up.
                    Example: Fortnite.  Rotating shop inventory. Everyone can buy the items when they're in the shop.
                        People get excited to see what's going to be on rotation the next day. Still a form of behavioral manipulation, but not the kind approved by Satan.
                And at the very least, if we're gonna do this loot box shit, make it so you can't get duplicates *whatsoever.*
                    I thought Apex loot boxes don't give duplicates?
                        They dont.
                that wouldn't stop the kids from spending tons of money and mocking the kids who dont...
                    It basically does. I don't remember league of legends having problems like that. Once you can just buy a specific skin from a list, it's not really special that you have it.
            True but I'm pretty sure introducing children to gambling and then preying on their ignorance is immoral if not illegal.   Should kids be able to play slots in Vegas?  The problem everyone has here is the loot box mechanic
                Can I be frank? I never understood the issue with loot boxes until, your post. Taking advantage of kids is absolutely evil and manipulatice yet I've always seen it in terms of adults
                Pokemon cards coming in booster packs is essentially the same concept.

Random chance to get something of value.
                    I would argue that trading card games are pretty scummy as well. They always become a game of who has more money to buy more cards. Bad systems are bad, whether other things are ALSO bad doesn't make a difference.
                    I always see this argument come up on lootbox discussions and it’s...a pretty good one lol
                        The argument against it is that you're getting a physical item that can be sold on the second-hand market.
                    >booster packs

Difference is physical ownership and the ability to retain market value. Booster pack card can be resold/bought individually and the buyer retains the option to list market value. Electronic goods from loot boxes have no physical ownership (only license to use) to you and there is no market value for the purchaser to retain. IE: The host of the game could shut the game down and "your" electronic goods go with it with no recourse to retain purchases.
                    It's 2nd hand market but I can buy a specific card and nothing is violating terms. Not a fan of trading card games either though, even with that.
            That’s why my kid will take martial arts lessons so anyone that tries to default him can get eliminated.
                Make sure your kid isn’t wearing the default gi & belt.
            It couldn’t possibly survive without at least “game breaking” ads (imagine watching a 30 second ad after legend selection [LOL]). 

However, they could take little to no hit by making mtx reasonably priced, from increased sales
            I think the issue is that these 20 skins or whatever they are for JUST the iron crown event cost significantly more than a regular game, but apex has significantly less actual game content than that. If the game had more content or the skins cost significantly less it wouldn’t be as much of an issue. But they’re trying to coax people into spending insane amounts of cash on cosmetic items just because the game was “free to play” even though the gameplay content just isn’t there. The game remains mostly stagnant with a few gameplay add ons here and there, but nothing even close to a triple A title you would only pay $80-$120 for. And I shutter at the fact that $80-$120 for a game is something I’m following the word “only” with.
        Growing up didn't the kids do the same thing in regards to clothing, such as name brand clothes vs whatever else?  The medium might have changed but kids mocking the disparity of wealth hasn't and most likely won't ever change.
            The big differentiation being that those kids can at least buy the exact piece of clothing they want. They don't go to the clothing store to find a guy with all the clothes behind the counter who asks for money, puts on a blindfold and chucks 3 random things in the kids face.
            That's true man.  I had rebock pump knock offs and got mocked for them.  But they still shouldn't be introducing kids to gambling.
        I agree with you but the analogy isn’t great, kids are going to spend their allowance on shit to impress their friends no matter what, this gen it happens to be game skins, when I was a kid it was CD’s or band shirts. They’re kids without jobs it’s not like they’re saving up for retirement
        Kids these days don't know the sheer joy of stomping a blinged out server with nothing but default skins and stock weapons while saying nothing in chat.

It makes people so angry for no good reason.
        Grown man here, is this really a thing? 'Default' as an insult?
    I'll put some money into the game because of how much I enjoy it and want to support, but if it ever becomes pay to win I'm gone.
    Micro transactions always make me think of that line from the last DJ. "while all the boys upstairs see how much you'll pay for what you used to get for free." I think micro transactions are unethical as fuck because it's basically gambling.
I quit Clash Royale because they did a huge money grab and introduced a monthly sub.

The P2W before that was absolutely there, but much more restrained.

    Yep

        Yep
    100% I'm not even mad just what I expected from EA tbh
Wait that's illegal
EAs weird uncle
We were blindly hopeful. But we all knew this would happen sooner or later
    Isn’t it just cosmetics? I’m truly confused as to why people are upset about a free game having cosmetics needing to be purchased.
        It’s not that.. it’s like a slot machine.. you might get 1 of 5 items.. maybe the one you want maybe not.. you’re guaranteed to get it after 5 tries or $20.. which ever come first
            That’s not that insane. Lots of games have skins that cost a lot. It’s cosmetics that literally don’t matter at all. It’s a first person game, you can’t see them. The people who are shooting at you aren’t paying attention. 

I really would like to see both sides who but who gives a shit.
                People play games for lots of reasons, and despite the fact that you personally don't care about cosmetics doesn't mean that other people don't. Like Contada said, it's not that the skins cost a lot (Which is to be expected to a degree if the game is F2P otherwise), it's the fact that you have to gamble with your money and HOPE that you eventually get the cosmetics that you want. 

I'm sure that I spent literal hundreds of dollars on skins in League of Legends, over the many years that I played that game. I was happy to pay a premium to support an otherwise-free game, to get cool cosmetics that made the experience more enjoyable for me. But every time I spent 10 or 20 bucks on skins, I *knew* what I was getting. People don't like being dicked around by gamble boxes, and having to put money into a slot machine indefinitely in the hopes that they'll get what they want. Again, it's great that you don't mind either way, more power to you, but RNG lootbox/slot-machine mechanics exist solely for the purpose of bringing in more money, not enhancing the gameplay experience at all.
    Can you explain what’s happened? Are EA forcing me to buy all these meaningless cosmetics?
        No, they're forcing their developers though to make them and to make them as enticing as possible like casino managers.
        No ones forcing you and no one said they did. Stop with the red herrings. That’s a very lazy and disingenuous way to make an argument.

What I actually said was the we all knew that EA would push these self-sabotaging, money-grabbing techniques on Respawn sooner or later. This is what they always do. They destroyed Dice and countless other studios with this bs.
        Lol no shit. I dont play apex anymore but i see all this whining on my front page when its literally just cosmetics that noone even notices. Why people buy them i have no clue. I never once noticed what cosmetics someone was wearing unless i killed them and picked up their gun.

People think "ill look so cool in that" bur seriously noone even looks at ur character long enough to make it worth any more than $1
            This is the only comment that matters in this entire thread lmao.
Did you see the good monetization Respawn did with Titanfall 1 and 2 when they were still fully in control?

Free updates, affordable cosmetic items, prices that made sense, a lot of free stuff that you could earn in game.

There is just no way devs like that go to shitty practices all of the sudden like that
    Sorry, you can't compare paid games with a free to play game. That's not how it works.

Respawn has said *ad nauseam* how EA is hands off with this game. These cosmetics and prices are 100% on Respawn.
        Did you believe all that pr talk? It's even probably EA that told them to say that. Nobody wanted to have EA associated with them after the loot box disaster.

But again we're both speculating so I'll give you the benefit of the doubt
            Man I hate statements like that. 

If you don't believe the "pr talk" then wouldn't it be safe to assume that EA actually did most of the work with Respawn only helping? You can't only make assumptions that help your argument.
                >wouldn't it be safe to assume that EA actually did most of the work with Respawn only helping?

No? Because Respawn is the developer and EA only acts as the publisher here. What does a publisher do? They decide on pricing, marketing (what needs to be said around the game), etc. So assuming EA might have encouraged Respawn to go with that statement makes sense.

I don't even understand how you could come up with Respawn only helping. Even if you did believe that, just the fact that there is so many similarities between the Titanfall games and Apex just proves it wrong
        Well, the free to play game was a financial success, while both Titanfalls weren't. Is the money obtained from Titanfall sales enough to overwhelm the money Apex did?
            TIL that a franchise that sold **14 million copies** across 2 games is not a financial success.
    I mean, the updates are still free...
    Good monetization? You mean the games that couldn't make money?
Yes, that’s typically how it goes. Developers are the ones making the content we want. Producers are the ones putting that content behind absurd “surprise mechanics”.
Yeah, but the cosmetics are bit crap. The problem is that I *want* the game to be supported with cosmetics, but it's consistently a really bad deal.
    Then don't buy them
    People pay for it. The decision how much this costs isn't made arbitrarily.
        Like with all of these, it's a handful of people with spending problems. They're worth more than the rest of the population put together. I get that.

But then, because most people are just going to see gambling addict bait, of course they're going to find it pathetic.
Tell me about it, I played counterstrike. They think this is a bad deal? Pathetic.
    That's a bad comparison, because cs skins can be sold for an absurd amount of money. Every cs skin has value. Apex skins will never have real value like that.
        Isn’t that just closer to actual gambling?
            Yup, but it's the same thing with most games with loot boxes now in the sense that you open a box that costs money for a chance at receiving something you want. Only difference is with cs you get actual value back. That's why everyone is so pissed with Respawn and EA, spending $7 PER box to get something cosmetic that doesn't even have true value is absurd.
                Respawn has gone out of their way to talk about how this is their game and EA doesn't run the show.



It's all on Respawn
                Here’s a suggestion. Don’t spend money on cosmetics in games. Problem solved. Moving on.
                    For a real answer: it affects the rest of us because we are no longer the customers, only the cosmetic players are customers.

Sure we may *buy* a game, but the upsell base is the real financial driver for these companies. Major publishers will continue ramp up not just the number of transactions, but the *integration* of transactions in games. 

Treading into controversial territory... From here on is absolutely my own opinion:

Unfortunately without regulation the game industry just becomes another major loss for consumers.

            My glock fade turned into $180 a few years ago. That value felt pretty real.
    Dude, I'm on your side that while it is a scummy practice, it is only for comestic items. But your comparison of downloading a free game vs Counter Strike is dumb. Up to last year, CS wasn't free, it was about 15 bucks. Then if you wanted you could buy a key that costs 2.50 bucks to open a lootcrate. If anything CS had less of an excuse because they essentially where double dipping.
        CS gave me a free skin which I then went and sold for $180. Now, I got lucky, but it wasn’t impossible to get the skins you wanted for free, and, worst case scenario, you could just buy the one you wanted from the marketplace. 

There’s no option here to buy what I want. I have to gamble with loot boxes and hope that I roll the right one. That’s the major difference. People wouldn’t be as mad if they allowed direct purchases. I hear rainbow 6 siege does that, though I don’t actually play it so I don’t know for sure, but nobody is rioting over there.
Sure they haven’t done anything wrong yet, but players like myself are pissed because we were willing to buy this season’s $10 battle pass only to find out the skins in it were fairly lame. In comes this timed event with skins everyone wants, but it’s behind a $150 paywall, far beyond the price of two normally priced games (thus negating the argument that this pricing is just “recouping the costs of this being a F2P game”)
I buy the battle passes because it gives me something to do and supports the developers. I feel I'm getting my money's worth. If the game really goes to shit, I won't buy them anymore. I still have no idea why people get so twisted over FUCKING COSMETICS. Don't buy them, easy. It's not like they are putting entire characters behind paywalls.
    I know! I actually thought it was pretty nice of them to allow characters to be unlocked so easily through in game play. That’s something they could’ve easily locked behind a paywall
        The in game cost to unlock legends is pretty reasonable. If you buy one battle pase, you can also grind enough by the end to buy another oass wi5h in game currency. It's still a free game. Don't like it? Don't play.
Great take, now watch as they proceed to make much less money than they could have because of a fundamental misunderstanding their playerbase demographics and how much disposable income they're willing to throw at a game like this.
    You'd be surprised how much money kids will dump into cosmetics. I have nephews who put a large portion of their gift money into skins. Over any given year, that's probably more than a half dozen AAA titles worth poured into 1 game.
        Kids spend money on dumb shit because they can and don't have bills or other things to pay for. We used to buy knockoff zippos and /r/mallninjashit-esque knives and swords at the fair just because we could. Pokémon cards, pogs, stretchy bracelets, anything we could buy for a few bucks. We bought useless shit because they were the only things we could buy, and usually because our friends had them too. This seems like a modern version of that. 

I guess I don't see how this is any different from what kids normally buy when they get a little money to throw around aside from the gambling aspect, which is shady. Card booster packs have been doing that for ages. Not that it makes either of them better or acceptable but that type of mechanic has been around for a long, long time. Other than that, it just seems like people getting pissy about a free game doing free game things.
            That's pretty true. We dumped heaps on crappy trading cards - and not just sport ones that could have value, crap like Jurassic Park trading cards.
    Reddit isn’t the average demographic of any popular games player base
        Maybe those anime dating sims
    Why do you think you know better than their analysts? Are you basing this on anything other than gut feeling?
        Because no studio under the Activision/EA banner has ever run a game into the ground before?

What about the analysts they employed at the time?
            They probably said " do this and you will make 100 million before finishing returns" and they did just that.
Doesn't COD's blackout have something like this now? Crates during the game only players who bought the pass or whatever it's called can open. 

&#x200B;

I stopped playing that long time ago.
    Blackjack's stash 
  
And yeah you have to earn the weapons from the black market in the game to be able to open a box in blackout that can contain any of the guns you've unlocked
        OK so not quite the same. That game's gotten so crazy with the passes and loot boxes and micro transactions, I don't know how anyone keeps up.
            Honestly I only keep up bc of the subreddit. I mean I own the game, but multiplayer and blackout didn't hold up as well as I thought they would, and zombies was lackluster due to the changes they made to the perk system. I don't own the black ops pass but the fact that bo4 has the same MTX system as fortnite, just without as nice looking of skins or whatever is really bananas for a AAA title that could cost upwards of $120
                The games 110 dollars plus all the money you have to spend to get all the guns. And of course the guns you get are random so you spend 500 bucks and still not get a single weapon and just get a fuckton of emotes and stickers
                    I really hope Modern Warfare doesn't end up doing this shit too. That game looks so promising and could honestly revive the series if they pull it off correctly. Part of me thinks they'll be able to do it but part of me knows it's still an Activision game and they'll probably do something similar to how they waited a month for reviews to come in on BO4 before they introduced tons of ridiculous microtransactions.
                        Yeah, I'm hoping IW can breathe some life back into COD with the Modern Warfare reboot, but knowing our luck I fear the game will get buttfucked by Activision
                            IW has to recover from the shitfest that was Infinite Warfare.  


MW is supposed to have no MTX.  But then again who knows
                        Exactly why I’m waiting. It’s IW we’re talking about and they aren’t sellouts like Treyarch so I doubt it’ll happen. But both the Treyarch games in the last 4 years had Treyarch and Activision saying “we will have no MTX” then a month later they release MTX and say “we need to make money somehow, there will be no pay to win MTX” then a month later we have pay to win MTX. 

When you put Activision and Treyarch in the same room together all the CoD fans are about to get assfucked
                        I have some bad news for you, friend. A lot of what Activision makes for revenue is MTX shit. They'll do it again. It worked for BLOPS4 where the game sold well initially and then they dropped in the MTX crap. They did it with Modern Warfare Remastered. They'll do it again.
            I gave up early.

Me and my friends spent so much time grinding blackout to unlock the characters by completing the in game challenges, most of which relied on luck of finding required item (if it spawned) and placing or winning the game. We got most of the characters available, and it took a lot of effort and patience. Then one day we started app, checked the store, and there were the characters we spent all that time earning. Fuck that game. There's no point in trying to earn anything in CoD because any effort is just wasted. 

Anyways, thats my story of how I gave up on black ops.
        They actually called them *Blackjack*? Ballsy move.
        I know COD's trash, and their fanbase is not the brightest... By that I just mean they dish out 60+ bucks for the same game they played last year, but why does something that is CLEARLY bullshit not call for revolt? An entire Gamemode dedicated to everyone having the same obstacles to overcome decides to have hidden guns you can ONLY get when you buy them through their market???
            Bo4 is the most egregious cash grab I have seen from Activision, bar them remastering AND reimagining the modern warfare serious. 
  
After bo3 and it's loot boxes, we got infinite warfare, which at least gave the base variant of every new weapon to owners of the season pass, and then world war 2 followed almost the exact same suit. 
  
Activision, and by extension treyarch, are fucking clods, that are spearheading a movement into gaming, where every game has a battlepass and cosmetics to buy. But the game itself is still $60
                [deleted]
                    truly sad how treyarch did live long enough to see themselves become the villain, if only sledgehammer games wasn't the villain at the beginning with advanced warfare
                        Exactly. Were it not for Sledgehammer tossing supply drops into Advanced Warfare as well as making them purchasable with better odds, the **entire** loot box fad wouldn’t exist. I respect Sledgehammer for changing their ways with how they did things within WWII, they’re still completely to blame for loot boxes becoming a thing. No CoD had them prior to Advanced Warfare.
                I will say this, the modern warfare remaster was a massive overhaul. Have you tried it? I also got it for free I’m pretty sure…
            > By that I just mean they dish out 60+ bucks for the same game they played last year

*[EA sports and 2k players be like](https://i.imgflip.com/2ywi2b.png)*

But seriously though, a new game every year and with Ultimate Teams kills any longevity of a sports game. I would be inclined to buy more sports game if they stayed with the game for 3 years or so before they dropped the next one. It's like as soon as they drop a game there is maybe a few months of updates and then they work on the following years game. I have no idea why anyone would want to put in time and money for ultimate teams just for it to become essentially obsolete within a year or so because the playerbase is playing the new title.
    Activision is just as bad maybe worse than EA but they seem to get a pass.  COD isn’t a free game and they do that crap.
    Lol it wouldn't surprise me. I played that game a lot till apex came out and I haven't played since. Actually downloaded some updates to try it out a few days ago and the first thing I saw on the openingb cutscene was Ruin running on a beach with one of those round floaties around his waist. So weird haha
    Jesus fucking Christ. Companies have decided to stop copying and just straight up hire Satan themselves.
And I don’t understand why? If the skins had reasonable prices they’d be making a lot more money than they are right now. Because I highly doubt anybody is willing to pay 12 bucks for an epic skin. 

Make the epic character skins like 3-4 bucks and the epic weapon skins like 1 or 2. I’m sure a lot more people would be willing to buy a lot of skins. At least more inclined than they are now, at 12$ a pop.

I do however suspect they don’t even want you to buy the skins. The absurd prices are probably there to make you buy apex packs instead where you’ll probably not even get an epic for those 12$

Believe it. Hell, this game made over 90 million the first month. The only reason revenue dipped heavily in the 2nd month was because there was nothing new to buy.
    They're targeting the whales who are willing to spend thousands of dollars to max out their inventory. It's what devs do in mobile games. Everyone hates this model, but it makes a lot of money.
    If a free to play game has high quality skins, I'd definitely spend 12 to buy a good skin for my favourite character to support the game I love. My personal budget for free games is 50 bucks a month, and yes that usually goes to permanent cosmetic content, regardless of the price, as long as I like the skin.
Jesus Christ that's fucked
Then why are people complaining? It is literally a free game... as long as loot boxes do not affect gameplay, I am indifferent about them. People just get upset because they spend $20 on apex coins only to not get what they wanted. Sorry, maybe spend your money more wisely.
    The majority of players don’t care. Reddit is a very vocal minority that absolutely loves a good circle jerk.

            Same tbh family
                Same here tho
        This place is cancer
    Been playing Apex nearly since it came out. Have not spent a dime. It's a lot of fun. I have considered paying something to basically thank the devs. That game is worth more than the $10 or $20 I will give them because I have put so many hours into that game. However, I'm thankful that no gameplay is affected by in game purchases at all, it's all purely cosmetic (like fortnight? Idk, don't play it but I think it does the same)
        I honestly feel like I should spend a few bucks here there because of how much I play it. I was never really into any battle royale games till respawn came around
    People complain because it replaces a satisfying system with a money making system
    I don’t understand either. If they had to pay to play the game, I’d get it. But it’s a FREE game. You can choose to pay for the cosmetics and it won’t give you any higher chance of winning. 

Honestly I just feel like most people complaining are just looking for something to complain about
        Because people bought the battle pass which only had 2 skins in it and it seems like all the badass skins were saved for this event. Not the main reason but uts gotta hurt for sure. So saying it's a free game is true but once you get that pass it's not free anymore.
            I bought the battle pass because it was a reaeonable cost and I spend a lot of hours there. The challenges give me something to do. I could care less about skins.
            You can see what's in the battle pass before purchase. What's the problem here?

        The slight devil's advocate here is that some of us genuinely want to spend money to support the game and enhance our experience. But they've priced out their own fans. Long term means lost revenue and support meaning the game will die quicker
        Is it wrong to expect new content, even just cosmetics, to be priced reasonably for the average consumer? There are people willing to spend up to $20 bucks for a single skin, but apparently that's not good enough for EAspawn.
    Reddit loves to complain about people wanting to make money. The vocal minority believes a free game needs to have every single thing free and the people slaving to make it shouldn’t be compensated for their hard work. And if it is completely free, they complain about ads that make money lol
    I agree, I’m not defending loot boxes and the purposeful addiction ethics.  
  
Since there is no trading system, it’s all completely overblown and I don’t think most adults care
    Honestly, how are they expecting updates to a free game if there is no microtransactions to support production? Loot boxes and rng is bullshit but if it doesn't effect gameplay, they can just not buy it.
    >Then why are people complaining? It is literally a free game... as long as loot boxes do not affect gameplay

Tell people to spend more wisely, indicating It's  a bad investment, then confused about why people are complaining.  Can't actually fathom how you can't comprehend the reason people dislike lootboxes, crazy you actually got 200 upvotes. From like minded idiots I suppose.   
Guess using your brain is too much to ask for these days.
    I think Apex is being brigaded. Easy way for Fortnite to stamp out it's competition is by stirring up a minority of child/teenage players with posts like these and lessening the popularity of Apex from within it's own community.
        Jesus, I hadn’t even looked through the subreddit recently. Almost every post is shitting on the game right now...
            It was even worse in season one lol
                Hm, kinda goes to show you how it really is to each their own. I enjoyed the shit out of season 1 with my friends...
                    Oh, I meant that I thought the complaining on here was more prevalant back then. Seems to mostly always revolve around cosmetics. Back then that they weren't good. Now that they're good, too expensive lol.
                        Sorry I think we had some miscommunication but I am definitely agreeing with you. What I meant was it is funny that people were here bitching and morning about whatever, and meanwhile I had literally no issues with season 1. Maybe that is because I didn’t buy the battle pass.. but why buy it if you already saw the shitty rewards lmao
                            Yeah, I didnt buy it either. Picked up Titanfall 2 complete edition for cheaper than the BP and that was and is a lot of fun.
    Right. After playing for a few dozen hours at first, I was interested enough to buy packs to support the game that I've gotten so much entertainment out of and to hopefully get some neat skins. Out of like 20 crates, I got like 3 items I thought were cool. I'll never buy packs again (though I don't regret it).

This whole crate thing is stupid as fuck. It's literally gambling. It's insulting to sit there and have the slot machine tactics try to excite you with lights and presentation and then have garbage come out. Younger minds are more susceptible to these tactics and it's an irresponsible way to make money. If they offered a way to buy the skins and stuff you want specifically, I would definitely pay for that. I will not pay for the chance to hopefully maybe get it by luck.
    I don’t think it’s right to put gambling in a game but for all the people who don’t want to spend money this won’t affect them at all. I don’t keep up to date with the changes they make in this game but if it’s all cosmetic it’s pretty ridiculous to compare that to buying weapons in-game.
    Because microtransactions bad and we deserve all post-launch cosmetics for free obviously
        Because gambling is bad sir
    It’s not about the cosmetic themselves but the fact that the only way to earn these items is to pay. You can play some 500 hours of this game all you want and I’m not excusing blizzard’s practise either but at least in Overwatch you have an option to play and earn. It’s absolutely mental how Respawn hasn’t sorted this shit out. 

I just want to play and earn, not pay and burn (a hole through my wallet).
        You are playing a free game! How do you expect them to make money? The developers can't eat "hours a player put into the game" and servers don't run on love.
        Who.. the fuck.. cares?  You think they make money off of people who just play 500 hours?  No.  It's a free game.  IT'S A FREE GAME!  Honestly, you should be willing to spend money on a game that you sink 500 hours into, but it's not required.
        Boo hoo, you don't get more free stuff on top of the free game you play. What a whiner
> changes anything about the actual gameplay. 

wont the new axe change that tho? you have a weapon on the landing
    They don’t deal any additional damage. See wraiths knife.
        ah ok, shiet im glad to hear that
This is exactly why I don't get why people are so up in arms about the payment system. The game is free guys
Well, some skins actually have preferable Iron sights. Not too game changing but they can make a difference for certain players.

Edit: Autocorrect is the bane of my mobile existence.
    I'll never buy skins, but the thin wingman skin definitely increases visibility. It's the opposite effect for some skins too like the legendary r99 with the tube decreases visibility.
Omg that sounds so unfair I’m want to make a meme about it I’m so mad
    Don't forget to call it gambling.  Even though gambling implies you can actually win something.  If you go to a store and buy a grab bag, or order a monthly lootbox,  you're not gambling, you're purchasing random garbage.
        Wrong, let’s say you have 100 different unique items and you could buy a box and there’s 4 different tiers;
65 of the items have a 50% chance,
20 of the items have a 25% chance,
10 of the items have a 20% chance,
and then the remaining 5 items have a 5% chance

When you buy it it’s not at complete random, you know all the items you are able to get and you know the different tiers and rarity you are gambling that you get the rare items
            You'll notice I didn't say "completely random" I said random. Your comment proves it's random.  You literally listed the percentages for the random chance. You even used the word "chance" multiple times. 

Look I can do it too: If you play [Pai Gow Poker optimally](https://wizardofodds.com/games/pai-gow-poker/) you have a 30% chance of winning, a 40% of pushing, and a 30% chance of losing.  Therefore the game isn't random, because you know all of the outcomes.
            Can you sell the rare items, or trade them somehow?
People act like they care about "gambling problems" or "targeting children" when they actually don't care about either of those things and are just crying that they can't get something shiny
    Hahahaha exactly! All of sudden these gamers care about the poor kids!! Brings a tear to my eye lol
It blows my mind people are freaking out this much about cosmetics. This is the whole point of them! To make the devs money without impacting the gameplay. I've got like 150 hours into this game ill for sure throw them a couple bucks. If you get a dope skin then great! 

This feels like a prime pick your battles moment.
    The principle behind charging only for cosmetics is good. No one is disagreeing with you for that. What people are annoyed about is the cost of these skins, the horrible battlepass progression, the lack of incentive to actually pay for any of it. We want the game to do well just like you, but how are we supposed to want to pay for any of this if the rewards are slowly dripped to us and aren't even cool anyway? Too many bland weapon and character skins, too many banners tags and things no one cares about thrown into the lootbox pool and battlepass progression, etc. No one is going to keep buying the battle passes at this rate and the game will die financially and lose dev support unless something changes. That is entirely seperate of how many people are playing F2P.

I bought the first battlepass primarily because I wanted to support the game. I didn't purchase the second battlepass, and after looking at the rewards and progression issues not being fixed, I'm honestly glad I didn't waste my money.
        I guarantee you the devs are hyper aware of the average spend per player, and they also have much more data to try to maximize that.

All the complaints just come off as whining about things being too expensive.

This post is pretty frustrating because devs have come a long way with offering f2p games without pay to win, and we should applaud that instead of make it synonymous with expensive cosmetics.

If you like the game but the cosmetics are too expensive, just keep playing and don't buy them. It's that easy.
            The issue with what you're saying is different companies have a different mindset on what "maximizing profits" means. Companies like EA that just want to make as much money as they safely can will almost always opt for making as much money in the short term as they possibly can, regardless of how it might damage the longevity of the game. 

Companies that actually want a long lasting game understand that even if they aren't maximizing their short term gains, they can make more money in the long run by not screwing their player base.

I agree with your last point, but it's a stupid point to argue. If no one buys the cosmetics, the game fucking dies. That's why people complain dude. People WANT to spend money on this game. I think you need to change your perspective a little bit. Have you seen gaming culture in the past 10 years? People literally beg companies to give them more reasons to throw their money at the game. It's insane. 

People are mad because the game doesn't really reward you in a significant way for spending money. This is the kind of system that targets whales and leaves the rest of the community feeling like if they can't drop large sums of money on the game then it's not worth spending any money at all.
                I agree that there are different strategies to maximizing profits. I don't know a ton about the industry, but I would think short term is preferable when games can easily be replaced by the next hot thing and become outdated after a few years.

Regardless, I don't see any "screwing" of the player base. I see cosmetics that aren't worth the price tag, and that's understandable. No one needs these items, so if you don't see the value in them, then don't buy them.

General price theory says it's easier to drop prices than raise them, but also higher price items can become a status symbol. Personally, I think fortnite did this right (maybe intentionally, maybe by accident) and Apex isn't getting it right.

If it was really just about supporting the game, they could just throw up a "donate" button. But it's not just about that, it's feeling entitled to good paid content. I get it, I would love good paid content that I thought was worth it. At the same time, if it's not there then I'm happy to enjoy the game for free.
                    >. I don't know a ton about the industry, but I would think short term is preferable when games can easily be replaced by the next hot thing and become outdated after a few years.

Look at DotA, League, WoW. They are industry Giants and it's because of two things imo: they got there early, and they made an effort to be better than their competitors. Right now we're in the battle Royale era and its still super early. Fortnite has definitely locked a spot as one of the top 3 battle royales for the next 10 years or more if they don't fuck it up. That is long term profit right there and you can see how their battle pass really supports the game. The rewards are worth it and it entices players to spend money and feel like it was money well spent. 

If you ask me, there's still an empty spot for top 3 battle royales, and Apex should be taking that spot and milking it for the next 10 years right along fortnite. But looking at what's available for purchase in Apex, there's nothing worth spending money on, and the few things that seem pretty cool require way too much investment to get. Maybe you personally believe that that's okay, it's just optional shit, I feel similarly if I'm being honest. But the game needs revenue to succeed.

>If it was really just about supporting the game, they could just throw up a "donate" button. But it's not just about that, it's feeling entitled to good paid content

I didn't say that it's "just about supporting the game". I think you've misunderstood me. When I said that people WANT to spend money on the game, I didn't mean that it was out of the goodness of their hearts and they want to make the devs smile. I meant that when people play a game they really like, they want to invest in it. For a lot of people that investment is time, and a lot of other people that investment is money. They want to take their money and buy in game shit that looks or feels cool as fuck and show off to their friends. There is actually a large number of gamers nowadays whose biggest motivator in games is making their characters look pretty. These people are not getting what they want and they will quit and the game will take a hit for it
    "a couple bucks"?
Have you seen the Iron Crown store?
    But the reason why people are complaining is because it’s not just a few bucks and it’s usually not dope at all.
        I know someone that has spent nearly 500 on rocket league.  For different wheels, they spent money. 

I paid 20 for the game and after playing it for over a year, tossed them $20 to open some of the hundreds of bins I accumulated. 

Apex, haven't even spent a penny on that game yet. Never will. There is no reason to. Let the suckers keep the game alive.
            I've probably spent around 500 bucks on Rocket League.  My inventory is probably worth about 700 bucks if I really tried hard to sell it.

But I really love the game and have enjoyed building my sets and trading around.  It's not as fun to trade or open crates any more but I have no regrets.

I'll spend money on cosmetics if the game is fun and the skins are cool.  I don't see the problem.
    People that aren't freaking out just don't care enough to realize how much of a BS system this is.

There's over 700\*3 cosmetics in the packs. We can get 45\*3 for free by lvl 100, and then none are available except for the BP ones. Furthermore, a guranteed legendary is every 30 boxes. This means unlucky players can get 1 legendary.

Their only option to get more is to either pay, or make a new account, which is stupid.

If you have lootboxes, they should be possible to obtain through grinding like crazy, so even if people are unlucky, they can obtain everything they wanted.  
If you have limited lootboxes, then there should be a store where players can always spend free currency on various cosmetics at high prices, so that even if the lootbox lottery is unkind, they can obtain some of the cool shit they actually wanted.

Mathematically, a casual player would take years to obtain everything, and people will always be willing to pay to avoid grinds. People aren't saying Apex should make no money, people just want the game to not be so fking greedy.
        I would have spent money on apex by now if I wasnt going to get ripped off spending it.
        I agree its set up poorly. But I feel the community can calm down over exaggerating the problem. It should feel good for casual players. You should be able to earn rewards that feel good when you get them. Pride and acxomplishment. Haha. I feel like this sub is beyond constructive critisism towards the developers at the moment and diving into a hateful circle jerk. 

I do agree though they feel lack luster and not worth the cost. For me personally its just cosmetics so "meh" game is still fun. 9/10. Extra 1 would come from fixing this sort of stuff you are talking about.
    Right? They released an awesome FREE game.

I get that some things are too pricey, but then just don’t buy them.
    People that have had access to the internet their entire lives seem to think everything on the internet should be free.
It's not crying about nothing, $7 is just a ridiculous price when you don't even know what you're buying...

They'd make a lot more money if they just let you buy a skin off your choice outright for $7. Instead, they're preying on people with gambling addictions to milk a small amount of people for more money per person.
    I just wish I had the choice between paying 5$ for random shit or 10$ for exactly what I want. Shit I once bought a 30$ skin in League of Legends, I don't care, but I'm not paying for rng. I'm not mad, I'm disappointed. I want to contribute to a game I love and get some cool stuff in exchange, but this model is disgusting beyond anything else seen elsewhere in the industry.
    So kinda like fortnite? I know it's hated but their system in terms of microtransactions is probably the best out there by far. Their seasonal thing also includes currency as tiers so it's entirely possible to keep buying next passes just based off the rewards you get.

Haven't played in a year but I rmbr each pass included as much as 1600 e bucks in tiers (easy to obtain bc challenges are pretty fair) or whatever they are called and a new pass only cost 1000. So in a few seasons ,u could build up to buy a rare skin that appears in their shop
lol yes! Mirage might be able to pull it off too
Can’t disagree there.

I’m not in a place where I can watch the video, but from what I can gather his argument is something like “cosmetics are a part of one’s enjoyment of the game”? Is that correct?

If so, I agree that they can be a part of one’s enjoyment of a game. However, no one would argue that they are more essential than say gameplay elements or maintaining of competitive balance, right? Because this is a free game, it means that their funding comes from somewhere, and if overpriced cosmetics purchased by whales is the most profitable and effective way for them to continue providing a completely free game, and updating it with new map elements, characters, and weapons, then I think that most people should be on board with that.
    Farming whales may be the most profitable way to keep a free game running, but it's far from ethical. Not all whales are people with disposable income. A lot of them are people with addiction problems when it comes to stuff like this.
Is that how every dude I've fought in solos so far has purple armor?
    Hell even in squads it always feels like the first time we get jumped they always have super loot and we are stuck with nothing
        That’s because you don’t remember all the squads you dusted while you had super loot
Spot on lol
It is but EA BAD, can’t upset the circlejerk
Right? I get the outcry over this event cuz it’s pretty bullshit, but it’s just cosmetics. The actual gameplay is free and that’s not gunna change.
Scumbags is being nice. They made some awesome new skins that don’t change anything in game and I’m not forced to buy them. This is a fucking outrage!!!

They get a little whiny there but some of the anger is a bit justified. Compared to prior Battlefield games there's been a tiny amount of map and content releases.
" it's so disrespectful to add women to this fight. It has nothing to do with being sexists! It's just disrespectful to what actually happened!"

Said the man child playing a game for pure entertainment and joy that re enacts some of the absolute darkest hours of humanity. Where they take joy in smashing an axe into a guys face, or carpet bombing an area or lighting them on fire or caving a guys skull in with a mace. Just for the pure entertainment of it. As if that's "respectful" to those to lived through those horrors. 

 As if it were supposed to be some kind of fucking documentary. 

Fucking idiots.
No, you are guaranteed one item from the collection. And the packs contain only one event item. It will take 24 packs to complete the set. With 2 available for free, it would take $154 to complete the set, plus an additional $35 for the heirloom.
You pay enough money on surprise mechanics to feel pride and accomplishment at the fact you get to pay another 35 for a weapon?
lol they should all go play Barbie Fashion Show if they care about cosmetics so much.
Maybe it's part of the plan.  Sell some to whales at a high price, then lower the price due to consumer demand and sell a bunch more.  Its Econ 101 to want people to pay the highest price for an item that they are willing to pay.
I think his whole point is, it is just cosmetics. If they did start making you pay for exclusive guns, it would be bullshit.
    ` ` [](/link)
> Today it's cosmetics, tomorrow it's exclusive guns. Then it's a subscription, if you really want to play that badly.

lol
The game does work?
    He means they need to fix the bugs. Those bugs are rather annoying, especially when it crashes mid game, or sends your squadmates into a game but not you.
[deleted]
They aren't paying to play dick is my point. They get that for free. They are not entitled to cosmetic items. What is so hard about that? We shouldn't assume it's a slippery slope. Further, they have data and we have anecdote.
It’s just not a great or original joke.

There are bigger implications to this though. For instance, in kids schools these days, *default* is a derogatory slur for someone who can't afford skins. Think of all the kids out there spending their entire allowance on fucking *slot machines* in order to increase their social status.  
That there is fucked up. And now they want to charge $7 per pack. Fuck right off.
    My kids call me a default..
        My dude .. take a seat.
        Oooffff
        F
        My friends have like the most  expensive looking skins in cs:go and other games, and I always get the skins no one really wants, the ones that look military or just normal cause I hate unrealistic shit...  


I think my collection of skins worth 2€ is better than the 100€ funky color skins =D
            I've never bought a Fortnite skin, hence, me being a default.
        You look that little shit dead in the eye and call him a Rust Lord.
        Mine too
        Trade the kid in for skins
    That is fucked up.  But unfortunately kids can be that way.  

Just playing devils advocate, if there wasn't a system to purchase these cosmetic items, how could the game survive other than ad revenue? Keep in mind I'm pretty new to gaming so theres a chance I'm missing a big part of the industry.
        The skins could be directly for sale. That's how it worked for the longest time. Now you have to draw the right skin at random.
            Ah, I missed the importance placed on "slot machines".  Yes. Fucked up.
                Example: Fortnite.  Rotating shop inventory. Everyone can buy the items when they're in the shop.
                    People get excited to see what's going to be on rotation the next day. Still a form of behavioral manipulation, but not the kind approved by Satan.
            And at the very least, if we're gonna do this loot box shit, make it so you can't get duplicates *whatsoever.*
                I thought Apex loot boxes don't give duplicates?
                    They dont.
            that wouldn't stop the kids from spending tons of money and mocking the kids who dont...
                It basically does. I don't remember league of legends having problems like that. Once you can just buy a specific skin from a list, it's not really special that you have it.
        True but I'm pretty sure introducing children to gambling and then preying on their ignorance is immoral if not illegal.   Should kids be able to play slots in Vegas?  The problem everyone has here is the loot box mechanic
            Can I be frank? I never understood the issue with loot boxes until, your post. Taking advantage of kids is absolutely evil and manipulatice yet I've always seen it in terms of adults
            Pokemon cards coming in booster packs is essentially the same concept.

Random chance to get something of value.
                I would argue that trading card games are pretty scummy as well. They always become a game of who has more money to buy more cards. Bad systems are bad, whether other things are ALSO bad doesn't make a difference.
                I always see this argument come up on lootbox discussions and it’s...a pretty good one lol
                    The argument against it is that you're getting a physical item that can be sold on the second-hand market.
                >booster packs

Difference is physical ownership and the ability to retain market value. Booster pack card can be resold/bought individually and the buyer retains the option to list market value. Electronic goods from loot boxes have no physical ownership (only license to use) to you and there is no market value for the purchaser to retain. IE: The host of the game could shut the game down and "your" electronic goods go with it with no recourse to retain purchases.
                It's 2nd hand market but I can buy a specific card and nothing is violating terms. Not a fan of trading card games either though, even with that.
        That’s why my kid will take martial arts lessons so anyone that tries to default him can get eliminated.
            Make sure your kid isn’t wearing the default gi & belt.
        It couldn’t possibly survive without at least “game breaking” ads (imagine watching a 30 second ad after legend selection [LOL]). 

However, they could take little to no hit by making mtx reasonably priced, from increased sales
        I think the issue is that these 20 skins or whatever they are for JUST the iron crown event cost significantly more than a regular game, but apex has significantly less actual game content than that. If the game had more content or the skins cost significantly less it wouldn’t be as much of an issue. But they’re trying to coax people into spending insane amounts of cash on cosmetic items just because the game was “free to play” even though the gameplay content just isn’t there. The game remains mostly stagnant with a few gameplay add ons here and there, but nothing even close to a triple A title you would only pay $80-$120 for. And I shutter at the fact that $80-$120 for a game is something I’m following the word “only” with.
    Growing up didn't the kids do the same thing in regards to clothing, such as name brand clothes vs whatever else?  The medium might have changed but kids mocking the disparity of wealth hasn't and most likely won't ever change.
        The big differentiation being that those kids can at least buy the exact piece of clothing they want. They don't go to the clothing store to find a guy with all the clothes behind the counter who asks for money, puts on a blindfold and chucks 3 random things in the kids face.
        That's true man.  I had rebock pump knock offs and got mocked for them.  But they still shouldn't be introducing kids to gambling.
    I agree with you but the analogy isn’t great, kids are going to spend their allowance on shit to impress their friends no matter what, this gen it happens to be game skins, when I was a kid it was CD’s or band shirts. They’re kids without jobs it’s not like they’re saving up for retirement
    Kids these days don't know the sheer joy of stomping a blinged out server with nothing but default skins and stock weapons while saying nothing in chat.

It makes people so angry for no good reason.
    Grown man here, is this really a thing? 'Default' as an insult?
I'll put some money into the game because of how much I enjoy it and want to support, but if it ever becomes pay to win I'm gone.
Micro transactions always make me think of that line from the last DJ. "while all the boys upstairs see how much you'll pay for what you used to get for free." I think micro transactions are unethical as fuck because it's basically gambling.
Yep
[removed]
    Yep
100% I'm not even mad just what I expected from EA tbh
Isn’t it just cosmetics? I’m truly confused as to why people are upset about a free game having cosmetics needing to be purchased.
    It’s not that.. it’s like a slot machine.. you might get 1 of 5 items.. maybe the one you want maybe not.. you’re guaranteed to get it after 5 tries or $20.. which ever come first
        That’s not that insane. Lots of games have skins that cost a lot. It’s cosmetics that literally don’t matter at all. It’s a first person game, you can’t see them. The people who are shooting at you aren’t paying attention. 

I really would like to see both sides who but who gives a shit.
            People play games for lots of reasons, and despite the fact that you personally don't care about cosmetics doesn't mean that other people don't. Like Contada said, it's not that the skins cost a lot (Which is to be expected to a degree if the game is F2P otherwise), it's the fact that you have to gamble with your money and HOPE that you eventually get the cosmetics that you want. 

I'm sure that I spent literal hundreds of dollars on skins in League of Legends, over the many years that I played that game. I was happy to pay a premium to support an otherwise-free game, to get cool cosmetics that made the experience more enjoyable for me. But every time I spent 10 or 20 bucks on skins, I *knew* what I was getting. People don't like being dicked around by gamble boxes, and having to put money into a slot machine indefinitely in the hopes that they'll get what they want. Again, it's great that you don't mind either way, more power to you, but RNG lootbox/slot-machine mechanics exist solely for the purpose of bringing in more money, not enhancing the gameplay experience at all.
Can you explain what’s happened? Are EA forcing me to buy all these meaningless cosmetics?
    No, they're forcing their developers though to make them and to make them as enticing as possible like casino managers.
    No ones forcing you and no one said they did. Stop with the red herrings. That’s a very lazy and disingenuous way to make an argument.

What I actually said was the we all knew that EA would push these self-sabotaging, money-grabbing techniques on Respawn sooner or later. This is what they always do. They destroyed Dice and countless other studios with this bs.
    Lol no shit. I dont play apex anymore but i see all this whining on my front page when its literally just cosmetics that noone even notices. Why people buy them i have no clue. I never once noticed what cosmetics someone was wearing unless i killed them and picked up their gun.

People think "ill look so cool in that" bur seriously noone even looks at ur character long enough to make it worth any more than $1
        This is the only comment that matters in this entire thread lmao.
Sorry, you can't compare paid games with a free to play game. That's not how it works.

Respawn has said *ad nauseam* how EA is hands off with this game. These cosmetics and prices are 100% on Respawn.
    Did you believe all that pr talk? It's even probably EA that told them to say that. Nobody wanted to have EA associated with them after the loot box disaster.

But again we're both speculating so I'll give you the benefit of the doubt
        Man I hate statements like that. 

If you don't believe the "pr talk" then wouldn't it be safe to assume that EA actually did most of the work with Respawn only helping? You can't only make assumptions that help your argument.
            >wouldn't it be safe to assume that EA actually did most of the work with Respawn only helping?

No? Because Respawn is the developer and EA only acts as the publisher here. What does a publisher do? They decide on pricing, marketing (what needs to be said around the game), etc. So assuming EA might have encouraged Respawn to go with that statement makes sense.

I don't even understand how you could come up with Respawn only helping. Even if you did believe that, just the fact that there is so many similarities between the Titanfall games and Apex just proves it wrong
    Well, the free to play game was a financial success, while both Titanfalls weren't. Is the money obtained from Titanfall sales enough to overwhelm the money Apex did?
        TIL that a franchise that sold **14 million copies** across 2 games is not a financial success.
I mean, the updates are still free...
Good monetization? You mean the games that couldn't make money?
Then don't buy them
People pay for it. The decision how much this costs isn't made arbitrarily.
    Like with all of these, it's a handful of people with spending problems. They're worth more than the rest of the population put together. I get that.

But then, because most people are just going to see gambling addict bait, of course they're going to find it pathetic.
That's a bad comparison, because cs skins can be sold for an absurd amount of money. Every cs skin has value. Apex skins will never have real value like that.
    Isn’t that just closer to actual gambling?
        Yup, but it's the same thing with most games with loot boxes now in the sense that you open a box that costs money for a chance at receiving something you want. Only difference is with cs you get actual value back. That's why everyone is so pissed with Respawn and EA, spending $7 PER box to get something cosmetic that doesn't even have true value is absurd.
            Respawn has gone out of their way to talk about how this is their game and EA doesn't run the show.



It's all on Respawn
            Here’s a suggestion. Don’t spend money on cosmetics in games. Problem solved. Moving on.
                For a real answer: it affects the rest of us because we are no longer the customers, only the cosmetic players are customers.

Sure we may *buy* a game, but the upsell base is the real financial driver for these companies. Major publishers will continue ramp up not just the number of transactions, but the *integration* of transactions in games. 

Treading into controversial territory... From here on is absolutely my own opinion:

Unfortunately without regulation the game industry just becomes another major loss for consumers.

        My glock fade turned into $180 a few years ago. That value felt pretty real.
Dude, I'm on your side that while it is a scummy practice, it is only for comestic items. But your comparison of downloading a free game vs Counter Strike is dumb. Up to last year, CS wasn't free, it was about 15 bucks. Then if you wanted you could buy a key that costs 2.50 bucks to open a lootcrate. If anything CS had less of an excuse because they essentially where double dipping.
    CS gave me a free skin which I then went and sold for $180. Now, I got lucky, but it wasn’t impossible to get the skins you wanted for free, and, worst case scenario, you could just buy the one you wanted from the marketplace. 

There’s no option here to buy what I want. I have to gamble with loot boxes and hope that I roll the right one. That’s the major difference. People wouldn’t be as mad if they allowed direct purchases. I hear rainbow 6 siege does that, though I don’t actually play it so I don’t know for sure, but nobody is rioting over there.
I know! I actually thought it was pretty nice of them to allow characters to be unlocked so easily through in game play. That’s something they could’ve easily locked behind a paywall
    The in game cost to unlock legends is pretty reasonable. If you buy one battle pase, you can also grind enough by the end to buy another oass wi5h in game currency. It's still a free game. Don't like it? Don't play.
You'd be surprised how much money kids will dump into cosmetics. I have nephews who put a large portion of their gift money into skins. Over any given year, that's probably more than a half dozen AAA titles worth poured into 1 game.
    Kids spend money on dumb shit because they can and don't have bills or other things to pay for. We used to buy knockoff zippos and /r/mallninjashit-esque knives and swords at the fair just because we could. Pokémon cards, pogs, stretchy bracelets, anything we could buy for a few bucks. We bought useless shit because they were the only things we could buy, and usually because our friends had them too. This seems like a modern version of that. 

I guess I don't see how this is any different from what kids normally buy when they get a little money to throw around aside from the gambling aspect, which is shady. Card booster packs have been doing that for ages. Not that it makes either of them better or acceptable but that type of mechanic has been around for a long, long time. Other than that, it just seems like people getting pissy about a free game doing free game things.
        That's pretty true. We dumped heaps on crappy trading cards - and not just sport ones that could have value, crap like Jurassic Park trading cards.
Reddit isn’t the average demographic of any popular games player base
    Maybe those anime dating sims
Why do you think you know better than their analysts? Are you basing this on anything other than gut feeling?
    Because no studio under the Activision/EA banner has ever run a game into the ground before?

What about the analysts they employed at the time?
        They probably said " do this and you will make 100 million before finishing returns" and they did just that.
Blackjack's stash 
  
And yeah you have to earn the weapons from the black market in the game to be able to open a box in blackout that can contain any of the guns you've unlocked
    OK so not quite the same. That game's gotten so crazy with the passes and loot boxes and micro transactions, I don't know how anyone keeps up.
        Honestly I only keep up bc of the subreddit. I mean I own the game, but multiplayer and blackout didn't hold up as well as I thought they would, and zombies was lackluster due to the changes they made to the perk system. I don't own the black ops pass but the fact that bo4 has the same MTX system as fortnite, just without as nice looking of skins or whatever is really bananas for a AAA title that could cost upwards of $120
            The games 110 dollars plus all the money you have to spend to get all the guns. And of course the guns you get are random so you spend 500 bucks and still not get a single weapon and just get a fuckton of emotes and stickers
                I really hope Modern Warfare doesn't end up doing this shit too. That game looks so promising and could honestly revive the series if they pull it off correctly. Part of me thinks they'll be able to do it but part of me knows it's still an Activision game and they'll probably do something similar to how they waited a month for reviews to come in on BO4 before they introduced tons of ridiculous microtransactions.
                    Yeah, I'm hoping IW can breathe some life back into COD with the Modern Warfare reboot, but knowing our luck I fear the game will get buttfucked by Activision
                        IW has to recover from the shitfest that was Infinite Warfare.  


MW is supposed to have no MTX.  But then again who knows
                    Exactly why I’m waiting. It’s IW we’re talking about and they aren’t sellouts like Treyarch so I doubt it’ll happen. But both the Treyarch games in the last 4 years had Treyarch and Activision saying “we will have no MTX” then a month later they release MTX and say “we need to make money somehow, there will be no pay to win MTX” then a month later we have pay to win MTX. 

When you put Activision and Treyarch in the same room together all the CoD fans are about to get assfucked
                    I have some bad news for you, friend. A lot of what Activision makes for revenue is MTX shit. They'll do it again. It worked for BLOPS4 where the game sold well initially and then they dropped in the MTX crap. They did it with Modern Warfare Remastered. They'll do it again.
        I gave up early.

Me and my friends spent so much time grinding blackout to unlock the characters by completing the in game challenges, most of which relied on luck of finding required item (if it spawned) and placing or winning the game. We got most of the characters available, and it took a lot of effort and patience. Then one day we started app, checked the store, and there were the characters we spent all that time earning. Fuck that game. There's no point in trying to earn anything in CoD because any effort is just wasted. 

Anyways, thats my story of how I gave up on black ops.
    They actually called them *Blackjack*? Ballsy move.
    I know COD's trash, and their fanbase is not the brightest... By that I just mean they dish out 60+ bucks for the same game they played last year, but why does something that is CLEARLY bullshit not call for revolt? An entire Gamemode dedicated to everyone having the same obstacles to overcome decides to have hidden guns you can ONLY get when you buy them through their market???
        Bo4 is the most egregious cash grab I have seen from Activision, bar them remastering AND reimagining the modern warfare serious. 
  
After bo3 and it's loot boxes, we got infinite warfare, which at least gave the base variant of every new weapon to owners of the season pass, and then world war 2 followed almost the exact same suit. 
  
Activision, and by extension treyarch, are fucking clods, that are spearheading a movement into gaming, where every game has a battlepass and cosmetics to buy. But the game itself is still $60
            [deleted]
                truly sad how treyarch did live long enough to see themselves become the villain, if only sledgehammer games wasn't the villain at the beginning with advanced warfare
                    Exactly. Were it not for Sledgehammer tossing supply drops into Advanced Warfare as well as making them purchasable with better odds, the **entire** loot box fad wouldn’t exist. I respect Sledgehammer for changing their ways with how they did things within WWII, they’re still completely to blame for loot boxes becoming a thing. No CoD had them prior to Advanced Warfare.
            I will say this, the modern warfare remaster was a massive overhaul. Have you tried it? I also got it for free I’m pretty sure…
        > By that I just mean they dish out 60+ bucks for the same game they played last year

*[EA sports and 2k players be like](https://i.imgflip.com/2ywi2b.png)*

But seriously though, a new game every year and with Ultimate Teams kills any longevity of a sports game. I would be inclined to buy more sports game if they stayed with the game for 3 years or so before they dropped the next one. It's like as soon as they drop a game there is maybe a few months of updates and then they work on the following years game. I have no idea why anyone would want to put in time and money for ultimate teams just for it to become essentially obsolete within a year or so because the playerbase is playing the new title.
Activision is just as bad maybe worse than EA but they seem to get a pass.  COD isn’t a free game and they do that crap.
Lol it wouldn't surprise me. I played that game a lot till apex came out and I haven't played since. Actually downloaded some updates to try it out a few days ago and the first thing I saw on the openingb cutscene was Ruin running on a beach with one of those round floaties around his waist. So weird haha

Believe it. Hell, this game made over 90 million the first month. The only reason revenue dipped heavily in the 2nd month was because there was nothing new to buy.
They're targeting the whales who are willing to spend thousands of dollars to max out their inventory. It's what devs do in mobile games. Everyone hates this model, but it makes a lot of money.
If a free to play game has high quality skins, I'd definitely spend 12 to buy a good skin for my favourite character to support the game I love. My personal budget for free games is 50 bucks a month, and yes that usually goes to permanent cosmetic content, regardless of the price, as long as I like the skin.
The majority of players don’t care. Reddit is a very vocal minority that absolutely loves a good circle jerk.
    ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) I love a good circle jerk, personally
        Same tbh family
            Same here tho
    This place is cancer
Been playing Apex nearly since it came out. Have not spent a dime. It's a lot of fun. I have considered paying something to basically thank the devs. That game is worth more than the $10 or $20 I will give them because I have put so many hours into that game. However, I'm thankful that no gameplay is affected by in game purchases at all, it's all purely cosmetic (like fortnight? Idk, don't play it but I think it does the same)
    I honestly feel like I should spend a few bucks here there because of how much I play it. I was never really into any battle royale games till respawn came around
People complain because it replaces a satisfying system with a money making system
I don’t understand either. If they had to pay to play the game, I’d get it. But it’s a FREE game. You can choose to pay for the cosmetics and it won’t give you any higher chance of winning. 

Honestly I just feel like most people complaining are just looking for something to complain about
    Because people bought the battle pass which only had 2 skins in it and it seems like all the badass skins were saved for this event. Not the main reason but uts gotta hurt for sure. So saying it's a free game is true but once you get that pass it's not free anymore.
        I bought the battle pass because it was a reaeonable cost and I spend a lot of hours there. The challenges give me something to do. I could care less about skins.
        You can see what's in the battle pass before purchase. What's the problem here?
[deleted]
    The slight devil's advocate here is that some of us genuinely want to spend money to support the game and enhance our experience. But they've priced out their own fans. Long term means lost revenue and support meaning the game will die quicker
    Is it wrong to expect new content, even just cosmetics, to be priced reasonably for the average consumer? There are people willing to spend up to $20 bucks for a single skin, but apparently that's not good enough for EAspawn.
Reddit loves to complain about people wanting to make money. The vocal minority believes a free game needs to have every single thing free and the people slaving to make it shouldn’t be compensated for their hard work. And if it is completely free, they complain about ads that make money lol
I agree, I’m not defending loot boxes and the purposeful addiction ethics.  
  
Since there is no trading system, it’s all completely overblown and I don’t think most adults care
Honestly, how are they expecting updates to a free game if there is no microtransactions to support production? Loot boxes and rng is bullshit but if it doesn't effect gameplay, they can just not buy it.
>Then why are people complaining? It is literally a free game... as long as loot boxes do not affect gameplay

Tell people to spend more wisely, indicating It's  a bad investment, then confused about why people are complaining.  Can't actually fathom how you can't comprehend the reason people dislike lootboxes, crazy you actually got 200 upvotes. From like minded idiots I suppose.   
Guess using your brain is too much to ask for these days.
I think Apex is being brigaded. Easy way for Fortnite to stamp out it's competition is by stirring up a minority of child/teenage players with posts like these and lessening the popularity of Apex from within it's own community.
    Jesus, I hadn’t even looked through the subreddit recently. Almost every post is shitting on the game right now...
        It was even worse in season one lol
            Hm, kinda goes to show you how it really is to each their own. I enjoyed the shit out of season 1 with my friends...
                Oh, I meant that I thought the complaining on here was more prevalant back then. Seems to mostly always revolve around cosmetics. Back then that they weren't good. Now that they're good, too expensive lol.
                    Sorry I think we had some miscommunication but I am definitely agreeing with you. What I meant was it is funny that people were here bitching and morning about whatever, and meanwhile I had literally no issues with season 1. Maybe that is because I didn’t buy the battle pass.. but why buy it if you already saw the shitty rewards lmao
                        Yeah, I didnt buy it either. Picked up Titanfall 2 complete edition for cheaper than the BP and that was and is a lot of fun.
Right. After playing for a few dozen hours at first, I was interested enough to buy packs to support the game that I've gotten so much entertainment out of and to hopefully get some neat skins. Out of like 20 crates, I got like 3 items I thought were cool. I'll never buy packs again (though I don't regret it).

This whole crate thing is stupid as fuck. It's literally gambling. It's insulting to sit there and have the slot machine tactics try to excite you with lights and presentation and then have garbage come out. Younger minds are more susceptible to these tactics and it's an irresponsible way to make money. If they offered a way to buy the skins and stuff you want specifically, I would definitely pay for that. I will not pay for the chance to hopefully maybe get it by luck.
I don’t think it’s right to put gambling in a game but for all the people who don’t want to spend money this won’t affect them at all. I don’t keep up to date with the changes they make in this game but if it’s all cosmetic it’s pretty ridiculous to compare that to buying weapons in-game.
Because microtransactions bad and we deserve all post-launch cosmetics for free obviously
    Because gambling is bad sir
It’s not about the cosmetic themselves but the fact that the only way to earn these items is to pay. You can play some 500 hours of this game all you want and I’m not excusing blizzard’s practise either but at least in Overwatch you have an option to play and earn. It’s absolutely mental how Respawn hasn’t sorted this shit out. 

I just want to play and earn, not pay and burn (a hole through my wallet).
    You are playing a free game! How do you expect them to make money? The developers can't eat "hours a player put into the game" and servers don't run on love.
    Who.. the fuck.. cares?  You think they make money off of people who just play 500 hours?  No.  It's a free game.  IT'S A FREE GAME!  Honestly, you should be willing to spend money on a game that you sink 500 hours into, but it's not required.
    Boo hoo, you don't get more free stuff on top of the free game you play. What a whiner
They don’t deal any additional damage. See wraiths knife.
    ah ok, shiet im glad to hear that
I'll never buy skins, but the thin wingman skin definitely increases visibility. It's the opposite effect for some skins too like the legendary r99 with the tube decreases visibility.
Don't forget to call it gambling.  Even though gambling implies you can actually win something.  If you go to a store and buy a grab bag, or order a monthly lootbox,  you're not gambling, you're purchasing random garbage.
    Wrong, let’s say you have 100 different unique items and you could buy a box and there’s 4 different tiers;
65 of the items have a 50% chance,
20 of the items have a 25% chance,
10 of the items have a 20% chance,
and then the remaining 5 items have a 5% chance

When you buy it it’s not at complete random, you know all the items you are able to get and you know the different tiers and rarity you are gambling that you get the rare items
        You'll notice I didn't say "completely random" I said random. Your comment proves it's random.  You literally listed the percentages for the random chance. You even used the word "chance" multiple times. 

Look I can do it too: If you play [Pai Gow Poker optimally](https://wizardofodds.com/games/pai-gow-poker/) you have a 30% chance of winning, a 40% of pushing, and a 30% chance of losing.  Therefore the game isn't random, because you know all of the outcomes.
        Can you sell the rare items, or trade them somehow?
Hahahaha exactly! All of sudden these gamers care about the poor kids!! Brings a tear to my eye lol
The principle behind charging only for cosmetics is good. No one is disagreeing with you for that. What people are annoyed about is the cost of these skins, the horrible battlepass progression, the lack of incentive to actually pay for any of it. We want the game to do well just like you, but how are we supposed to want to pay for any of this if the rewards are slowly dripped to us and aren't even cool anyway? Too many bland weapon and character skins, too many banners tags and things no one cares about thrown into the lootbox pool and battlepass progression, etc. No one is going to keep buying the battle passes at this rate and the game will die financially and lose dev support unless something changes. That is entirely seperate of how many people are playing F2P.

I bought the first battlepass primarily because I wanted to support the game. I didn't purchase the second battlepass, and after looking at the rewards and progression issues not being fixed, I'm honestly glad I didn't waste my money.
    I guarantee you the devs are hyper aware of the average spend per player, and they also have much more data to try to maximize that.

All the complaints just come off as whining about things being too expensive.

This post is pretty frustrating because devs have come a long way with offering f2p games without pay to win, and we should applaud that instead of make it synonymous with expensive cosmetics.

If you like the game but the cosmetics are too expensive, just keep playing and don't buy them. It's that easy.
        The issue with what you're saying is different companies have a different mindset on what "maximizing profits" means. Companies like EA that just want to make as much money as they safely can will almost always opt for making as much money in the short term as they possibly can, regardless of how it might damage the longevity of the game. 

Companies that actually want a long lasting game understand that even if they aren't maximizing their short term gains, they can make more money in the long run by not screwing their player base.

I agree with your last point, but it's a stupid point to argue. If no one buys the cosmetics, the game fucking dies. That's why people complain dude. People WANT to spend money on this game. I think you need to change your perspective a little bit. Have you seen gaming culture in the past 10 years? People literally beg companies to give them more reasons to throw their money at the game. It's insane. 

People are mad because the game doesn't really reward you in a significant way for spending money. This is the kind of system that targets whales and leaves the rest of the community feeling like if they can't drop large sums of money on the game then it's not worth spending any money at all.
            I agree that there are different strategies to maximizing profits. I don't know a ton about the industry, but I would think short term is preferable when games can easily be replaced by the next hot thing and become outdated after a few years.

Regardless, I don't see any "screwing" of the player base. I see cosmetics that aren't worth the price tag, and that's understandable. No one needs these items, so if you don't see the value in them, then don't buy them.

General price theory says it's easier to drop prices than raise them, but also higher price items can become a status symbol. Personally, I think fortnite did this right (maybe intentionally, maybe by accident) and Apex isn't getting it right.

If it was really just about supporting the game, they could just throw up a "donate" button. But it's not just about that, it's feeling entitled to good paid content. I get it, I would love good paid content that I thought was worth it. At the same time, if it's not there then I'm happy to enjoy the game for free.
                >. I don't know a ton about the industry, but I would think short term is preferable when games can easily be replaced by the next hot thing and become outdated after a few years.

Look at DotA, League, WoW. They are industry Giants and it's because of two things imo: they got there early, and they made an effort to be better than their competitors. Right now we're in the battle Royale era and its still super early. Fortnite has definitely locked a spot as one of the top 3 battle royales for the next 10 years or more if they don't fuck it up. That is long term profit right there and you can see how their battle pass really supports the game. The rewards are worth it and it entices players to spend money and feel like it was money well spent. 

If you ask me, there's still an empty spot for top 3 battle royales, and Apex should be taking that spot and milking it for the next 10 years right along fortnite. But looking at what's available for purchase in Apex, there's nothing worth spending money on, and the few things that seem pretty cool require way too much investment to get. Maybe you personally believe that that's okay, it's just optional shit, I feel similarly if I'm being honest. But the game needs revenue to succeed.

>If it was really just about supporting the game, they could just throw up a "donate" button. But it's not just about that, it's feeling entitled to good paid content

I didn't say that it's "just about supporting the game". I think you've misunderstood me. When I said that people WANT to spend money on the game, I didn't mean that it was out of the goodness of their hearts and they want to make the devs smile. I meant that when people play a game they really like, they want to invest in it. For a lot of people that investment is time, and a lot of other people that investment is money. They want to take their money and buy in game shit that looks or feels cool as fuck and show off to their friends. There is actually a large number of gamers nowadays whose biggest motivator in games is making their characters look pretty. These people are not getting what they want and they will quit and the game will take a hit for it
"a couple bucks"?
Have you seen the Iron Crown store?
But the reason why people are complaining is because it’s not just a few bucks and it’s usually not dope at all.
    I know someone that has spent nearly 500 on rocket league.  For different wheels, they spent money. 

I paid 20 for the game and after playing it for over a year, tossed them $20 to open some of the hundreds of bins I accumulated. 

Apex, haven't even spent a penny on that game yet. Never will. There is no reason to. Let the suckers keep the game alive.
        I've probably spent around 500 bucks on Rocket League.  My inventory is probably worth about 700 bucks if I really tried hard to sell it.

But I really love the game and have enjoyed building my sets and trading around.  It's not as fun to trade or open crates any more but I have no regrets.

I'll spend money on cosmetics if the game is fun and the skins are cool.  I don't see the problem.
People that aren't freaking out just don't care enough to realize how much of a BS system this is.

There's over 700\*3 cosmetics in the packs. We can get 45\*3 for free by lvl 100, and then none are available except for the BP ones. Furthermore, a guranteed legendary is every 30 boxes. This means unlucky players can get 1 legendary.

Their only option to get more is to either pay, or make a new account, which is stupid.

If you have lootboxes, they should be possible to obtain through grinding like crazy, so even if people are unlucky, they can obtain everything they wanted.  
If you have limited lootboxes, then there should be a store where players can always spend free currency on various cosmetics at high prices, so that even if the lootbox lottery is unkind, they can obtain some of the cool shit they actually wanted.

Mathematically, a casual player would take years to obtain everything, and people will always be willing to pay to avoid grinds. People aren't saying Apex should make no money, people just want the game to not be so fking greedy.
    I would have spent money on apex by now if I wasnt going to get ripped off spending it.
    I agree its set up poorly. But I feel the community can calm down over exaggerating the problem. It should feel good for casual players. You should be able to earn rewards that feel good when you get them. Pride and acxomplishment. Haha. I feel like this sub is beyond constructive critisism towards the developers at the moment and diving into a hateful circle jerk. 

I do agree though they feel lack luster and not worth the cost. For me personally its just cosmetics so "meh" game is still fun. 9/10. Extra 1 would come from fixing this sort of stuff you are talking about.
Right? They released an awesome FREE game.

I get that some things are too pricey, but then just don’t buy them.
People that have had access to the internet their entire lives seem to think everything on the internet should be free.
I just wish I had the choice between paying 5$ for random shit or 10$ for exactly what I want. Shit I once bought a 30$ skin in League of Legends, I don't care, but I'm not paying for rng. I'm not mad, I'm disappointed. I want to contribute to a game I love and get some cool stuff in exchange, but this model is disgusting beyond anything else seen elsewhere in the industry.
So kinda like fortnite? I know it's hated but their system in terms of microtransactions is probably the best out there by far. Their seasonal thing also includes currency as tiers so it's entirely possible to keep buying next passes just based off the rewards you get.

Haven't played in a year but I rmbr each pass included as much as 1600 e bucks in tiers (easy to obtain bc challenges are pretty fair) or whatever they are called and a new pass only cost 1000. So in a few seasons ,u could build up to buy a rare skin that appears in their shop

Farming whales may be the most profitable way to keep a free game running, but it's far from ethical. Not all whales are people with disposable income. A lot of them are people with addiction problems when it comes to stuff like this.
Hell even in squads it always feels like the first time we get jumped they always have super loot and we are stuck with nothing
    That’s because you don’t remember all the squads you dusted while you had super loot

He means they need to fix the bugs. Those bugs are rather annoying, especially when it crashes mid game, or sends your squadmates into a game but not you.

My kids call me a default..
    My dude .. take a seat.
    Oooffff
    F
    My friends have like the most  expensive looking skins in cs:go and other games, and I always get the skins no one really wants, the ones that look military or just normal cause I hate unrealistic shit...  


I think my collection of skins worth 2€ is better than the 100€ funky color skins =D
        I've never bought a Fortnite skin, hence, me being a default.
    You look that little shit dead in the eye and call him a Rust Lord.
    Mine too
    Trade the kid in for skins
That is fucked up.  But unfortunately kids can be that way.  

Just playing devils advocate, if there wasn't a system to purchase these cosmetic items, how could the game survive other than ad revenue? Keep in mind I'm pretty new to gaming so theres a chance I'm missing a big part of the industry.
    The skins could be directly for sale. That's how it worked for the longest time. Now you have to draw the right skin at random.
        Ah, I missed the importance placed on "slot machines".  Yes. Fucked up.
            Example: Fortnite.  Rotating shop inventory. Everyone can buy the items when they're in the shop.
                People get excited to see what's going to be on rotation the next day. Still a form of behavioral manipulation, but not the kind approved by Satan.
        And at the very least, if we're gonna do this loot box shit, make it so you can't get duplicates *whatsoever.*
            I thought Apex loot boxes don't give duplicates?
                They dont.
        that wouldn't stop the kids from spending tons of money and mocking the kids who dont...
            It basically does. I don't remember league of legends having problems like that. Once you can just buy a specific skin from a list, it's not really special that you have it.
    True but I'm pretty sure introducing children to gambling and then preying on their ignorance is immoral if not illegal.   Should kids be able to play slots in Vegas?  The problem everyone has here is the loot box mechanic
        Can I be frank? I never understood the issue with loot boxes until, your post. Taking advantage of kids is absolutely evil and manipulatice yet I've always seen it in terms of adults
        Pokemon cards coming in booster packs is essentially the same concept.

Random chance to get something of value.
            I would argue that trading card games are pretty scummy as well. They always become a game of who has more money to buy more cards. Bad systems are bad, whether other things are ALSO bad doesn't make a difference.
            I always see this argument come up on lootbox discussions and it’s...a pretty good one lol
                The argument against it is that you're getting a physical item that can be sold on the second-hand market.
            >booster packs

Difference is physical ownership and the ability to retain market value. Booster pack card can be resold/bought individually and the buyer retains the option to list market value. Electronic goods from loot boxes have no physical ownership (only license to use) to you and there is no market value for the purchaser to retain. IE: The host of the game could shut the game down and "your" electronic goods go with it with no recourse to retain purchases.
            It's 2nd hand market but I can buy a specific card and nothing is violating terms. Not a fan of trading card games either though, even with that.
    That’s why my kid will take martial arts lessons so anyone that tries to default him can get eliminated.
        Make sure your kid isn’t wearing the default gi & belt.
    It couldn’t possibly survive without at least “game breaking” ads (imagine watching a 30 second ad after legend selection [LOL]). 

However, they could take little to no hit by making mtx reasonably priced, from increased sales
    I think the issue is that these 20 skins or whatever they are for JUST the iron crown event cost significantly more than a regular game, but apex has significantly less actual game content than that. If the game had more content or the skins cost significantly less it wouldn’t be as much of an issue. But they’re trying to coax people into spending insane amounts of cash on cosmetic items just because the game was “free to play” even though the gameplay content just isn’t there. The game remains mostly stagnant with a few gameplay add ons here and there, but nothing even close to a triple A title you would only pay $80-$120 for. And I shutter at the fact that $80-$120 for a game is something I’m following the word “only” with.
Growing up didn't the kids do the same thing in regards to clothing, such as name brand clothes vs whatever else?  The medium might have changed but kids mocking the disparity of wealth hasn't and most likely won't ever change.
    The big differentiation being that those kids can at least buy the exact piece of clothing they want. They don't go to the clothing store to find a guy with all the clothes behind the counter who asks for money, puts on a blindfold and chucks 3 random things in the kids face.
    That's true man.  I had rebock pump knock offs and got mocked for them.  But they still shouldn't be introducing kids to gambling.
I agree with you but the analogy isn’t great, kids are going to spend their allowance on shit to impress their friends no matter what, this gen it happens to be game skins, when I was a kid it was CD’s or band shirts. They’re kids without jobs it’s not like they’re saving up for retirement
Kids these days don't know the sheer joy of stomping a blinged out server with nothing but default skins and stock weapons while saying nothing in chat.

It makes people so angry for no good reason.
Grown man here, is this really a thing? 'Default' as an insult?
Yep
It’s not that.. it’s like a slot machine.. you might get 1 of 5 items.. maybe the one you want maybe not.. you’re guaranteed to get it after 5 tries or $20.. which ever come first
    That’s not that insane. Lots of games have skins that cost a lot. It’s cosmetics that literally don’t matter at all. It’s a first person game, you can’t see them. The people who are shooting at you aren’t paying attention. 

I really would like to see both sides who but who gives a shit.
        People play games for lots of reasons, and despite the fact that you personally don't care about cosmetics doesn't mean that other people don't. Like Contada said, it's not that the skins cost a lot (Which is to be expected to a degree if the game is F2P otherwise), it's the fact that you have to gamble with your money and HOPE that you eventually get the cosmetics that you want. 

I'm sure that I spent literal hundreds of dollars on skins in League of Legends, over the many years that I played that game. I was happy to pay a premium to support an otherwise-free game, to get cool cosmetics that made the experience more enjoyable for me. But every time I spent 10 or 20 bucks on skins, I *knew* what I was getting. People don't like being dicked around by gamble boxes, and having to put money into a slot machine indefinitely in the hopes that they'll get what they want. Again, it's great that you don't mind either way, more power to you, but RNG lootbox/slot-machine mechanics exist solely for the purpose of bringing in more money, not enhancing the gameplay experience at all.
No, they're forcing their developers though to make them and to make them as enticing as possible like casino managers.
No ones forcing you and no one said they did. Stop with the red herrings. That’s a very lazy and disingenuous way to make an argument.

What I actually said was the we all knew that EA would push these self-sabotaging, money-grabbing techniques on Respawn sooner or later. This is what they always do. They destroyed Dice and countless other studios with this bs.
Lol no shit. I dont play apex anymore but i see all this whining on my front page when its literally just cosmetics that noone even notices. Why people buy them i have no clue. I never once noticed what cosmetics someone was wearing unless i killed them and picked up their gun.

People think "ill look so cool in that" bur seriously noone even looks at ur character long enough to make it worth any more than $1
    This is the only comment that matters in this entire thread lmao.
Did you believe all that pr talk? It's even probably EA that told them to say that. Nobody wanted to have EA associated with them after the loot box disaster.

But again we're both speculating so I'll give you the benefit of the doubt
    Man I hate statements like that. 

If you don't believe the "pr talk" then wouldn't it be safe to assume that EA actually did most of the work with Respawn only helping? You can't only make assumptions that help your argument.
        >wouldn't it be safe to assume that EA actually did most of the work with Respawn only helping?

No? Because Respawn is the developer and EA only acts as the publisher here. What does a publisher do? They decide on pricing, marketing (what needs to be said around the game), etc. So assuming EA might have encouraged Respawn to go with that statement makes sense.

I don't even understand how you could come up with Respawn only helping. Even if you did believe that, just the fact that there is so many similarities between the Titanfall games and Apex just proves it wrong
Well, the free to play game was a financial success, while both Titanfalls weren't. Is the money obtained from Titanfall sales enough to overwhelm the money Apex did?
    TIL that a franchise that sold **14 million copies** across 2 games is not a financial success.
Like with all of these, it's a handful of people with spending problems. They're worth more than the rest of the population put together. I get that.

But then, because most people are just going to see gambling addict bait, of course they're going to find it pathetic.
Isn’t that just closer to actual gambling?
    Yup, but it's the same thing with most games with loot boxes now in the sense that you open a box that costs money for a chance at receiving something you want. Only difference is with cs you get actual value back. That's why everyone is so pissed with Respawn and EA, spending $7 PER box to get something cosmetic that doesn't even have true value is absurd.
        Respawn has gone out of their way to talk about how this is their game and EA doesn't run the show.



It's all on Respawn
        Here’s a suggestion. Don’t spend money on cosmetics in games. Problem solved. Moving on.
            For a real answer: it affects the rest of us because we are no longer the customers, only the cosmetic players are customers.

Sure we may *buy* a game, but the upsell base is the real financial driver for these companies. Major publishers will continue ramp up not just the number of transactions, but the *integration* of transactions in games. 

Treading into controversial territory... From here on is absolutely my own opinion:

Unfortunately without regulation the game industry just becomes another major loss for consumers.

    They do though, there are plenty of 3rd party sites that allow you to sell them for real money, crypto, etc.

    My glock fade turned into $180 a few years ago. That value felt pretty real.
CS gave me a free skin which I then went and sold for $180. Now, I got lucky, but it wasn’t impossible to get the skins you wanted for free, and, worst case scenario, you could just buy the one you wanted from the marketplace. 

There’s no option here to buy what I want. I have to gamble with loot boxes and hope that I roll the right one. That’s the major difference. People wouldn’t be as mad if they allowed direct purchases. I hear rainbow 6 siege does that, though I don’t actually play it so I don’t know for sure, but nobody is rioting over there.
The in game cost to unlock legends is pretty reasonable. If you buy one battle pase, you can also grind enough by the end to buy another oass wi5h in game currency. It's still a free game. Don't like it? Don't play.
Kids spend money on dumb shit because they can and don't have bills or other things to pay for. We used to buy knockoff zippos and /r/mallninjashit-esque knives and swords at the fair just because we could. Pokémon cards, pogs, stretchy bracelets, anything we could buy for a few bucks. We bought useless shit because they were the only things we could buy, and usually because our friends had them too. This seems like a modern version of that. 

I guess I don't see how this is any different from what kids normally buy when they get a little money to throw around aside from the gambling aspect, which is shady. Card booster packs have been doing that for ages. Not that it makes either of them better or acceptable but that type of mechanic has been around for a long, long time. Other than that, it just seems like people getting pissy about a free game doing free game things.
    That's pretty true. We dumped heaps on crappy trading cards - and not just sport ones that could have value, crap like Jurassic Park trading cards.
Maybe those anime dating sims
Because no studio under the Activision/EA banner has ever run a game into the ground before?

What about the analysts they employed at the time?
    They probably said " do this and you will make 100 million before finishing returns" and they did just that.
OK so not quite the same. That game's gotten so crazy with the passes and loot boxes and micro transactions, I don't know how anyone keeps up.
    Honestly I only keep up bc of the subreddit. I mean I own the game, but multiplayer and blackout didn't hold up as well as I thought they would, and zombies was lackluster due to the changes they made to the perk system. I don't own the black ops pass but the fact that bo4 has the same MTX system as fortnite, just without as nice looking of skins or whatever is really bananas for a AAA title that could cost upwards of $120
        The games 110 dollars plus all the money you have to spend to get all the guns. And of course the guns you get are random so you spend 500 bucks and still not get a single weapon and just get a fuckton of emotes and stickers
            I really hope Modern Warfare doesn't end up doing this shit too. That game looks so promising and could honestly revive the series if they pull it off correctly. Part of me thinks they'll be able to do it but part of me knows it's still an Activision game and they'll probably do something similar to how they waited a month for reviews to come in on BO4 before they introduced tons of ridiculous microtransactions.
                Yeah, I'm hoping IW can breathe some life back into COD with the Modern Warfare reboot, but knowing our luck I fear the game will get buttfucked by Activision
                    IW has to recover from the shitfest that was Infinite Warfare.  


MW is supposed to have no MTX.  But then again who knows
                Exactly why I’m waiting. It’s IW we’re talking about and they aren’t sellouts like Treyarch so I doubt it’ll happen. But both the Treyarch games in the last 4 years had Treyarch and Activision saying “we will have no MTX” then a month later they release MTX and say “we need to make money somehow, there will be no pay to win MTX” then a month later we have pay to win MTX. 

When you put Activision and Treyarch in the same room together all the CoD fans are about to get assfucked
                I have some bad news for you, friend. A lot of what Activision makes for revenue is MTX shit. They'll do it again. It worked for BLOPS4 where the game sold well initially and then they dropped in the MTX crap. They did it with Modern Warfare Remastered. They'll do it again.
    I gave up early.

Me and my friends spent so much time grinding blackout to unlock the characters by completing the in game challenges, most of which relied on luck of finding required item (if it spawned) and placing or winning the game. We got most of the characters available, and it took a lot of effort and patience. Then one day we started app, checked the store, and there were the characters we spent all that time earning. Fuck that game. There's no point in trying to earn anything in CoD because any effort is just wasted. 

Anyways, thats my story of how I gave up on black ops.
They actually called them *Blackjack*? Ballsy move.
I know COD's trash, and their fanbase is not the brightest... By that I just mean they dish out 60+ bucks for the same game they played last year, but why does something that is CLEARLY bullshit not call for revolt? An entire Gamemode dedicated to everyone having the same obstacles to overcome decides to have hidden guns you can ONLY get when you buy them through their market???
    Bo4 is the most egregious cash grab I have seen from Activision, bar them remastering AND reimagining the modern warfare serious. 
  
After bo3 and it's loot boxes, we got infinite warfare, which at least gave the base variant of every new weapon to owners of the season pass, and then world war 2 followed almost the exact same suit. 
  
Activision, and by extension treyarch, are fucking clods, that are spearheading a movement into gaming, where every game has a battlepass and cosmetics to buy. But the game itself is still $60
        [deleted]
            truly sad how treyarch did live long enough to see themselves become the villain, if only sledgehammer games wasn't the villain at the beginning with advanced warfare
                Exactly. Were it not for Sledgehammer tossing supply drops into Advanced Warfare as well as making them purchasable with better odds, the **entire** loot box fad wouldn’t exist. I respect Sledgehammer for changing their ways with how they did things within WWII, they’re still completely to blame for loot boxes becoming a thing. No CoD had them prior to Advanced Warfare.
        I will say this, the modern warfare remaster was a massive overhaul. Have you tried it? I also got it for free I’m pretty sure…
    > By that I just mean they dish out 60+ bucks for the same game they played last year

*[EA sports and 2k players be like](https://i.imgflip.com/2ywi2b.png)*

But seriously though, a new game every year and with Ultimate Teams kills any longevity of a sports game. I would be inclined to buy more sports game if they stayed with the game for 3 years or so before they dropped the next one. It's like as soon as they drop a game there is maybe a few months of updates and then they work on the following years game. I have no idea why anyone would want to put in time and money for ultimate teams just for it to become essentially obsolete within a year or so because the playerbase is playing the new title.
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) I love a good circle jerk, personally
    Same tbh family
        Same here tho
This place is cancer
I honestly feel like I should spend a few bucks here there because of how much I play it. I was never really into any battle royale games till respawn came around
Because people bought the battle pass which only had 2 skins in it and it seems like all the badass skins were saved for this event. Not the main reason but uts gotta hurt for sure. So saying it's a free game is true but once you get that pass it's not free anymore.
    I bought the battle pass because it was a reaeonable cost and I spend a lot of hours there. The challenges give me something to do. I could care less about skins.
    You can see what's in the battle pass before purchase. What's the problem here?
The slight devil's advocate here is that some of us genuinely want to spend money to support the game and enhance our experience. But they've priced out their own fans. Long term means lost revenue and support meaning the game will die quicker
Is it wrong to expect new content, even just cosmetics, to be priced reasonably for the average consumer? There are people willing to spend up to $20 bucks for a single skin, but apparently that's not good enough for EAspawn.
Jesus, I hadn’t even looked through the subreddit recently. Almost every post is shitting on the game right now...
    It was even worse in season one lol
        Hm, kinda goes to show you how it really is to each their own. I enjoyed the shit out of season 1 with my friends...
            Oh, I meant that I thought the complaining on here was more prevalant back then. Seems to mostly always revolve around cosmetics. Back then that they weren't good. Now that they're good, too expensive lol.
                Sorry I think we had some miscommunication but I am definitely agreeing with you. What I meant was it is funny that people were here bitching and morning about whatever, and meanwhile I had literally no issues with season 1. Maybe that is because I didn’t buy the battle pass.. but why buy it if you already saw the shitty rewards lmao
                    Yeah, I didnt buy it either. Picked up Titanfall 2 complete edition for cheaper than the BP and that was and is a lot of fun.
Because gambling is bad sir
You are playing a free game! How do you expect them to make money? The developers can't eat "hours a player put into the game" and servers don't run on love.
Who.. the fuck.. cares?  You think they make money off of people who just play 500 hours?  No.  It's a free game.  IT'S A FREE GAME!  Honestly, you should be willing to spend money on a game that you sink 500 hours into, but it's not required.
Boo hoo, you don't get more free stuff on top of the free game you play. What a whiner
ah ok, shiet im glad to hear that
Wrong, let’s say you have 100 different unique items and you could buy a box and there’s 4 different tiers;
65 of the items have a 50% chance,
20 of the items have a 25% chance,
10 of the items have a 20% chance,
and then the remaining 5 items have a 5% chance

When you buy it it’s not at complete random, you know all the items you are able to get and you know the different tiers and rarity you are gambling that you get the rare items
    You'll notice I didn't say "completely random" I said random. Your comment proves it's random.  You literally listed the percentages for the random chance. You even used the word "chance" multiple times. 

Look I can do it too: If you play [Pai Gow Poker optimally](https://wizardofodds.com/games/pai-gow-poker/) you have a 30% chance of winning, a 40% of pushing, and a 30% chance of losing.  Therefore the game isn't random, because you know all of the outcomes.
    Can you sell the rare items, or trade them somehow?
I guarantee you the devs are hyper aware of the average spend per player, and they also have much more data to try to maximize that.

All the complaints just come off as whining about things being too expensive.

This post is pretty frustrating because devs have come a long way with offering f2p games without pay to win, and we should applaud that instead of make it synonymous with expensive cosmetics.

If you like the game but the cosmetics are too expensive, just keep playing and don't buy them. It's that easy.
    The issue with what you're saying is different companies have a different mindset on what "maximizing profits" means. Companies like EA that just want to make as much money as they safely can will almost always opt for making as much money in the short term as they possibly can, regardless of how it might damage the longevity of the game. 

Companies that actually want a long lasting game understand that even if they aren't maximizing their short term gains, they can make more money in the long run by not screwing their player base.

I agree with your last point, but it's a stupid point to argue. If no one buys the cosmetics, the game fucking dies. That's why people complain dude. People WANT to spend money on this game. I think you need to change your perspective a little bit. Have you seen gaming culture in the past 10 years? People literally beg companies to give them more reasons to throw their money at the game. It's insane. 

People are mad because the game doesn't really reward you in a significant way for spending money. This is the kind of system that targets whales and leaves the rest of the community feeling like if they can't drop large sums of money on the game then it's not worth spending any money at all.
        I agree that there are different strategies to maximizing profits. I don't know a ton about the industry, but I would think short term is preferable when games can easily be replaced by the next hot thing and become outdated after a few years.

Regardless, I don't see any "screwing" of the player base. I see cosmetics that aren't worth the price tag, and that's understandable. No one needs these items, so if you don't see the value in them, then don't buy them.

General price theory says it's easier to drop prices than raise them, but also higher price items can become a status symbol. Personally, I think fortnite did this right (maybe intentionally, maybe by accident) and Apex isn't getting it right.

If it was really just about supporting the game, they could just throw up a "donate" button. But it's not just about that, it's feeling entitled to good paid content. I get it, I would love good paid content that I thought was worth it. At the same time, if it's not there then I'm happy to enjoy the game for free.
            >. I don't know a ton about the industry, but I would think short term is preferable when games can easily be replaced by the next hot thing and become outdated after a few years.

Look at DotA, League, WoW. They are industry Giants and it's because of two things imo: they got there early, and they made an effort to be better than their competitors. Right now we're in the battle Royale era and its still super early. Fortnite has definitely locked a spot as one of the top 3 battle royales for the next 10 years or more if they don't fuck it up. That is long term profit right there and you can see how their battle pass really supports the game. The rewards are worth it and it entices players to spend money and feel like it was money well spent. 

If you ask me, there's still an empty spot for top 3 battle royales, and Apex should be taking that spot and milking it for the next 10 years right along fortnite. But looking at what's available for purchase in Apex, there's nothing worth spending money on, and the few things that seem pretty cool require way too much investment to get. Maybe you personally believe that that's okay, it's just optional shit, I feel similarly if I'm being honest. But the game needs revenue to succeed.

>If it was really just about supporting the game, they could just throw up a "donate" button. But it's not just about that, it's feeling entitled to good paid content

I didn't say that it's "just about supporting the game". I think you've misunderstood me. When I said that people WANT to spend money on the game, I didn't mean that it was out of the goodness of their hearts and they want to make the devs smile. I meant that when people play a game they really like, they want to invest in it. For a lot of people that investment is time, and a lot of other people that investment is money. They want to take their money and buy in game shit that looks or feels cool as fuck and show off to their friends. There is actually a large number of gamers nowadays whose biggest motivator in games is making their characters look pretty. These people are not getting what they want and they will quit and the game will take a hit for it
I know someone that has spent nearly 500 on rocket league.  For different wheels, they spent money. 

I paid 20 for the game and after playing it for over a year, tossed them $20 to open some of the hundreds of bins I accumulated. 

Apex, haven't even spent a penny on that game yet. Never will. There is no reason to. Let the suckers keep the game alive.
    I've probably spent around 500 bucks on Rocket League.  My inventory is probably worth about 700 bucks if I really tried hard to sell it.

But I really love the game and have enjoyed building my sets and trading around.  It's not as fun to trade or open crates any more but I have no regrets.

I'll spend money on cosmetics if the game is fun and the skins are cool.  I don't see the problem.
I would have spent money on apex by now if I wasnt going to get ripped off spending it.
I agree its set up poorly. But I feel the community can calm down over exaggerating the problem. It should feel good for casual players. You should be able to earn rewards that feel good when you get them. Pride and acxomplishment. Haha. I feel like this sub is beyond constructive critisism towards the developers at the moment and diving into a hateful circle jerk. 

I do agree though they feel lack luster and not worth the cost. For me personally its just cosmetics so "meh" game is still fun. 9/10. Extra 1 would come from fixing this sort of stuff you are talking about.

My friends have like the most  expensive looking skins in cs:go and other games, and I always get the skins no one really wants, the ones that look military or just normal cause I hate unrealistic shit...  


I think my collection of skins worth 2€ is better than the 100€ funky color skins =D
    I've never bought a Fortnite skin, hence, me being a default.
You look that little shit dead in the eye and call him a Rust Lord.
Mine too
Trade the kid in for skins
The skins could be directly for sale. That's how it worked for the longest time. Now you have to draw the right skin at random.
    Ah, I missed the importance placed on "slot machines".  Yes. Fucked up.
        Example: Fortnite.  Rotating shop inventory. Everyone can buy the items when they're in the shop.
            People get excited to see what's going to be on rotation the next day. Still a form of behavioral manipulation, but not the kind approved by Satan.
    And at the very least, if we're gonna do this loot box shit, make it so you can't get duplicates *whatsoever.*
        I thought Apex loot boxes don't give duplicates?
            They dont.
    that wouldn't stop the kids from spending tons of money and mocking the kids who dont...
        It basically does. I don't remember league of legends having problems like that. Once you can just buy a specific skin from a list, it's not really special that you have it.
True but I'm pretty sure introducing children to gambling and then preying on their ignorance is immoral if not illegal.   Should kids be able to play slots in Vegas?  The problem everyone has here is the loot box mechanic
    Can I be frank? I never understood the issue with loot boxes until, your post. Taking advantage of kids is absolutely evil and manipulatice yet I've always seen it in terms of adults
    Pokemon cards coming in booster packs is essentially the same concept.

Random chance to get something of value.
        I would argue that trading card games are pretty scummy as well. They always become a game of who has more money to buy more cards. Bad systems are bad, whether other things are ALSO bad doesn't make a difference.
        I always see this argument come up on lootbox discussions and it’s...a pretty good one lol
            The argument against it is that you're getting a physical item that can be sold on the second-hand market.
        >booster packs

Difference is physical ownership and the ability to retain market value. Booster pack card can be resold/bought individually and the buyer retains the option to list market value. Electronic goods from loot boxes have no physical ownership (only license to use) to you and there is no market value for the purchaser to retain. IE: The host of the game could shut the game down and "your" electronic goods go with it with no recourse to retain purchases.
        It's 2nd hand market but I can buy a specific card and nothing is violating terms. Not a fan of trading card games either though, even with that.
That’s why my kid will take martial arts lessons so anyone that tries to default him can get eliminated.
    Make sure your kid isn’t wearing the default gi & belt.
It couldn’t possibly survive without at least “game breaking” ads (imagine watching a 30 second ad after legend selection [LOL]). 

However, they could take little to no hit by making mtx reasonably priced, from increased sales
I think the issue is that these 20 skins or whatever they are for JUST the iron crown event cost significantly more than a regular game, but apex has significantly less actual game content than that. If the game had more content or the skins cost significantly less it wouldn’t be as much of an issue. But they’re trying to coax people into spending insane amounts of cash on cosmetic items just because the game was “free to play” even though the gameplay content just isn’t there. The game remains mostly stagnant with a few gameplay add ons here and there, but nothing even close to a triple A title you would only pay $80-$120 for. And I shutter at the fact that $80-$120 for a game is something I’m following the word “only” with.
The big differentiation being that those kids can at least buy the exact piece of clothing they want. They don't go to the clothing store to find a guy with all the clothes behind the counter who asks for money, puts on a blindfold and chucks 3 random things in the kids face.
That's true man.  I had rebock pump knock offs and got mocked for them.  But they still shouldn't be introducing kids to gambling.
That’s not that insane. Lots of games have skins that cost a lot. It’s cosmetics that literally don’t matter at all. It’s a first person game, you can’t see them. The people who are shooting at you aren’t paying attention. 

I really would like to see both sides who but who gives a shit.
    People play games for lots of reasons, and despite the fact that you personally don't care about cosmetics doesn't mean that other people don't. Like Contada said, it's not that the skins cost a lot (Which is to be expected to a degree if the game is F2P otherwise), it's the fact that you have to gamble with your money and HOPE that you eventually get the cosmetics that you want. 

I'm sure that I spent literal hundreds of dollars on skins in League of Legends, over the many years that I played that game. I was happy to pay a premium to support an otherwise-free game, to get cool cosmetics that made the experience more enjoyable for me. But every time I spent 10 or 20 bucks on skins, I *knew* what I was getting. People don't like being dicked around by gamble boxes, and having to put money into a slot machine indefinitely in the hopes that they'll get what they want. Again, it's great that you don't mind either way, more power to you, but RNG lootbox/slot-machine mechanics exist solely for the purpose of bringing in more money, not enhancing the gameplay experience at all.
This is the only comment that matters in this entire thread lmao.
Man I hate statements like that. 

If you don't believe the "pr talk" then wouldn't it be safe to assume that EA actually did most of the work with Respawn only helping? You can't only make assumptions that help your argument.
    >wouldn't it be safe to assume that EA actually did most of the work with Respawn only helping?

No? Because Respawn is the developer and EA only acts as the publisher here. What does a publisher do? They decide on pricing, marketing (what needs to be said around the game), etc. So assuming EA might have encouraged Respawn to go with that statement makes sense.

I don't even understand how you could come up with Respawn only helping. Even if you did believe that, just the fact that there is so many similarities between the Titanfall games and Apex just proves it wrong
TIL that a franchise that sold **14 million copies** across 2 games is not a financial success.
Yup, but it's the same thing with most games with loot boxes now in the sense that you open a box that costs money for a chance at receiving something you want. Only difference is with cs you get actual value back. That's why everyone is so pissed with Respawn and EA, spending $7 PER box to get something cosmetic that doesn't even have true value is absurd.
    Respawn has gone out of their way to talk about how this is their game and EA doesn't run the show.



It's all on Respawn
    Here’s a suggestion. Don’t spend money on cosmetics in games. Problem solved. Moving on.
        For a real answer: it affects the rest of us because we are no longer the customers, only the cosmetic players are customers.

Sure we may *buy* a game, but the upsell base is the real financial driver for these companies. Major publishers will continue ramp up not just the number of transactions, but the *integration* of transactions in games. 

Treading into controversial territory... From here on is absolutely my own opinion:

Unfortunately without regulation the game industry just becomes another major loss for consumers.
They do though, there are plenty of 3rd party sites that allow you to sell them for real money, crypto, etc.

My glock fade turned into $180 a few years ago. That value felt pretty real.
That's pretty true. We dumped heaps on crappy trading cards - and not just sport ones that could have value, crap like Jurassic Park trading cards.
They probably said " do this and you will make 100 million before finishing returns" and they did just that.
Honestly I only keep up bc of the subreddit. I mean I own the game, but multiplayer and blackout didn't hold up as well as I thought they would, and zombies was lackluster due to the changes they made to the perk system. I don't own the black ops pass but the fact that bo4 has the same MTX system as fortnite, just without as nice looking of skins or whatever is really bananas for a AAA title that could cost upwards of $120
    The games 110 dollars plus all the money you have to spend to get all the guns. And of course the guns you get are random so you spend 500 bucks and still not get a single weapon and just get a fuckton of emotes and stickers
        I really hope Modern Warfare doesn't end up doing this shit too. That game looks so promising and could honestly revive the series if they pull it off correctly. Part of me thinks they'll be able to do it but part of me knows it's still an Activision game and they'll probably do something similar to how they waited a month for reviews to come in on BO4 before they introduced tons of ridiculous microtransactions.
            Yeah, I'm hoping IW can breathe some life back into COD with the Modern Warfare reboot, but knowing our luck I fear the game will get buttfucked by Activision
                IW has to recover from the shitfest that was Infinite Warfare.  


MW is supposed to have no MTX.  But then again who knows
            Exactly why I’m waiting. It’s IW we’re talking about and they aren’t sellouts like Treyarch so I doubt it’ll happen. But both the Treyarch games in the last 4 years had Treyarch and Activision saying “we will have no MTX” then a month later they release MTX and say “we need to make money somehow, there will be no pay to win MTX” then a month later we have pay to win MTX. 

When you put Activision and Treyarch in the same room together all the CoD fans are about to get assfucked
            I have some bad news for you, friend. A lot of what Activision makes for revenue is MTX shit. They'll do it again. It worked for BLOPS4 where the game sold well initially and then they dropped in the MTX crap. They did it with Modern Warfare Remastered. They'll do it again.
I gave up early.

Me and my friends spent so much time grinding blackout to unlock the characters by completing the in game challenges, most of which relied on luck of finding required item (if it spawned) and placing or winning the game. We got most of the characters available, and it took a lot of effort and patience. Then one day we started app, checked the store, and there were the characters we spent all that time earning. Fuck that game. There's no point in trying to earn anything in CoD because any effort is just wasted. 

Anyways, thats my story of how I gave up on black ops.
Bo4 is the most egregious cash grab I have seen from Activision, bar them remastering AND reimagining the modern warfare serious. 
  
After bo3 and it's loot boxes, we got infinite warfare, which at least gave the base variant of every new weapon to owners of the season pass, and then world war 2 followed almost the exact same suit. 
  
Activision, and by extension treyarch, are fucking clods, that are spearheading a movement into gaming, where every game has a battlepass and cosmetics to buy. But the game itself is still $60
    [deleted]
        truly sad how treyarch did live long enough to see themselves become the villain, if only sledgehammer games wasn't the villain at the beginning with advanced warfare
            Exactly. Were it not for Sledgehammer tossing supply drops into Advanced Warfare as well as making them purchasable with better odds, the **entire** loot box fad wouldn’t exist. I respect Sledgehammer for changing their ways with how they did things within WWII, they’re still completely to blame for loot boxes becoming a thing. No CoD had them prior to Advanced Warfare.
    I will say this, the modern warfare remaster was a massive overhaul. Have you tried it? I also got it for free I’m pretty sure…
> By that I just mean they dish out 60+ bucks for the same game they played last year

*[EA sports and 2k players be like](https://i.imgflip.com/2ywi2b.png)*

But seriously though, a new game every year and with Ultimate Teams kills any longevity of a sports game. I would be inclined to buy more sports game if they stayed with the game for 3 years or so before they dropped the next one. It's like as soon as they drop a game there is maybe a few months of updates and then they work on the following years game. I have no idea why anyone would want to put in time and money for ultimate teams just for it to become essentially obsolete within a year or so because the playerbase is playing the new title.
Same tbh family
    Same here tho
I bought the battle pass because it was a reaeonable cost and I spend a lot of hours there. The challenges give me something to do. I could care less about skins.
You can see what's in the battle pass before purchase. What's the problem here?
It was even worse in season one lol
    Hm, kinda goes to show you how it really is to each their own. I enjoyed the shit out of season 1 with my friends...
        Oh, I meant that I thought the complaining on here was more prevalant back then. Seems to mostly always revolve around cosmetics. Back then that they weren't good. Now that they're good, too expensive lol.
            Sorry I think we had some miscommunication but I am definitely agreeing with you. What I meant was it is funny that people were here bitching and morning about whatever, and meanwhile I had literally no issues with season 1. Maybe that is because I didn’t buy the battle pass.. but why buy it if you already saw the shitty rewards lmao
                Yeah, I didnt buy it either. Picked up Titanfall 2 complete edition for cheaper than the BP and that was and is a lot of fun.

    >booster packs

Difference is physical ownership and the ability to retain market value. Booster pack card can be resold/bought individually and the buyer retains the option to list market value. Electronic goods from loot boxes have no physical ownership (only license to use) to you and there is no market value for the purchaser to retain. IE: The host of the game could shut the game down and "your" electronic goods go with it with no recourse to retain purchases.
    It's 2nd hand market but I can buy a specific card and nothing is violating terms. Not a fan of trading card games either though, even with that.
Make sure your kid isn’t wearing the default gi & belt.
People play games for lots of reasons, and despite the fact that you personally don't care about cosmetics doesn't mean that other people don't. Like Contada said, it's not that the skins cost a lot (Which is to be expected to a degree if the game is F2P otherwise), it's the fact that you have to gamble with your money and HOPE that you eventually get the cosmetics that you want. 

I'm sure that I spent literal hundreds of dollars on skins in League of Legends, over the many years that I played that game. I was happy to pay a premium to support an otherwise-free game, to get cool cosmetics that made the experience more enjoyable for me. But every time I spent 10 or 20 bucks on skins, I *knew* what I was getting. People don't like being dicked around by gamble boxes, and having to put money into a slot machine indefinitely in the hopes that they'll get what they want. Again, it's great that you don't mind either way, more power to you, but RNG lootbox/slot-machine mechanics exist solely for the purpose of bringing in more money, not enhancing the gameplay experience at all.
>wouldn't it be safe to assume that EA actually did most of the work with Respawn only helping?

No? Because Respawn is the developer and EA only acts as the publisher here. What does a publisher do? They decide on pricing, marketing (what needs to be said around the game), etc. So assuming EA might have encouraged Respawn to go with that statement makes sense.

I don't even understand how you could come up with Respawn only helping. Even if you did believe that, just the fact that there is so many similarities between the Titanfall games and Apex just proves it wrong
Respawn has gone out of their way to talk about how this is their game and EA doesn't run the show.



It's all on Respawn
Here’s a suggestion. Don’t spend money on cosmetics in games. Problem solved. Moving on.
    For a real answer: it affects the rest of us because we are no longer the customers, only the cosmetic players are customers.

Sure we may *buy* a game, but the upsell base is the real financial driver for these companies. Major publishers will continue ramp up not just the number of transactions, but the *integration* of transactions in games. 

Treading into controversial territory... From here on is absolutely my own opinion:

Unfortunately without regulation the game industry just becomes another major loss for consumers.
The games 110 dollars plus all the money you have to spend to get all the guns. And of course the guns you get are random so you spend 500 bucks and still not get a single weapon and just get a fuckton of emotes and stickers
    I really hope Modern Warfare doesn't end up doing this shit too. That game looks so promising and could honestly revive the series if they pull it off correctly. Part of me thinks they'll be able to do it but part of me knows it's still an Activision game and they'll probably do something similar to how they waited a month for reviews to come in on BO4 before they introduced tons of ridiculous microtransactions.
        Yeah, I'm hoping IW can breathe some life back into COD with the Modern Warfare reboot, but knowing our luck I fear the game will get buttfucked by Activision
            IW has to recover from the shitfest that was Infinite Warfare.  


MW is supposed to have no MTX.  But then again who knows
        Exactly why I’m waiting. It’s IW we’re talking about and they aren’t sellouts like Treyarch so I doubt it’ll happen. But both the Treyarch games in the last 4 years had Treyarch and Activision saying “we will have no MTX” then a month later they release MTX and say “we need to make money somehow, there will be no pay to win MTX” then a month later we have pay to win MTX. 

When you put Activision and Treyarch in the same room together all the CoD fans are about to get assfucked
        I have some bad news for you, friend. A lot of what Activision makes for revenue is MTX shit. They'll do it again. It worked for BLOPS4 where the game sold well initially and then they dropped in the MTX crap. They did it with Modern Warfare Remastered. They'll do it again.

    truly sad how treyarch did live long enough to see themselves become the villain, if only sledgehammer games wasn't the villain at the beginning with advanced warfare
        Exactly. Were it not for Sledgehammer tossing supply drops into Advanced Warfare as well as making them purchasable with better odds, the **entire** loot box fad wouldn’t exist. I respect Sledgehammer for changing their ways with how they did things within WWII, they’re still completely to blame for loot boxes becoming a thing. No CoD had them prior to Advanced Warfare.
I will say this, the modern warfare remaster was a massive overhaul. Have you tried it? I also got it for free I’m pretty sure…
Same here tho
Hm, kinda goes to show you how it really is to each their own. I enjoyed the shit out of season 1 with my friends...
    Oh, I meant that I thought the complaining on here was more prevalant back then. Seems to mostly always revolve around cosmetics. Back then that they weren't good. Now that they're good, too expensive lol.
        Sorry I think we had some miscommunication but I am definitely agreeing with you. What I meant was it is funny that people were here bitching and morning about whatever, and meanwhile I had literally no issues with season 1. Maybe that is because I didn’t buy the battle pass.. but why buy it if you already saw the shitty rewards lmao
            Yeah, I didnt buy it either. Picked up Titanfall 2 complete edition for cheaper than the BP and that was and is a lot of fun.
I agree that there are different strategies to maximizing profits. I don't know a ton about the industry, but I would think short term is preferable when games can easily be replaced by the next hot thing and become outdated after a few years.

Regardless, I don't see any "screwing" of the player base. I see cosmetics that aren't worth the price tag, and that's understandable. No one needs these items, so if you don't see the value in them, then don't buy them.

General price theory says it's easier to drop prices than raise them, but also higher price items can become a status symbol. Personally, I think fortnite did this right (maybe intentionally, maybe by accident) and Apex isn't getting it right.

If it was really just about supporting the game, they could just throw up a "donate" button. But it's not just about that, it's feeling entitled to good paid content. I get it, I would love good paid content that I thought was worth it. At the same time, if it's not there then I'm happy to enjoy the game for free.
    >. I don't know a ton about the industry, but I would think short term is preferable when games can easily be replaced by the next hot thing and become outdated after a few years.

Look at DotA, League, WoW. They are industry Giants and it's because of two things imo: they got there early, and they made an effort to be better than their competitors. Right now we're in the battle Royale era and its still super early. Fortnite has definitely locked a spot as one of the top 3 battle royales for the next 10 years or more if they don't fuck it up. That is long term profit right there and you can see how their battle pass really supports the game. The rewards are worth it and it entices players to spend money and feel like it was money well spent. 

If you ask me, there's still an empty spot for top 3 battle royales, and Apex should be taking that spot and milking it for the next 10 years right along fortnite. But looking at what's available for purchase in Apex, there's nothing worth spending money on, and the few things that seem pretty cool require way too much investment to get. Maybe you personally believe that that's okay, it's just optional shit, I feel similarly if I'm being honest. But the game needs revenue to succeed.

>If it was really just about supporting the game, they could just throw up a "donate" button. But it's not just about that, it's feeling entitled to good paid content

I didn't say that it's "just about supporting the game". I think you've misunderstood me. When I said that people WANT to spend money on the game, I didn't mean that it was out of the goodness of their hearts and they want to make the devs smile. I meant that when people play a game they really like, they want to invest in it. For a lot of people that investment is time, and a lot of other people that investment is money. They want to take their money and buy in game shit that looks or feels cool as fuck and show off to their friends. There is actually a large number of gamers nowadays whose biggest motivator in games is making their characters look pretty. These people are not getting what they want and they will quit and the game will take a hit for it
Purchase the Standup Comedy DLC!
    Clever....
Outbid works too. “Hold x to begin an auction for the hammerpoint rounds”
    Current bid stands at 7001 coins. You have won.!
        Game over.
        I read that in Pathfinders voice.

    Your teammate who doesn’t even have a gun for those bullets outbids you. He does this the entire game. Meet: The TrollWhale
        Good grief
Example: Fortnite.  Rotating shop inventory. Everyone can buy the items when they're in the shop.
    People get excited to see what's going to be on rotation the next day. Still a form of behavioral manipulation, but not the kind approved by Satan.
I thought Apex loot boxes don't give duplicates?
    They dont.
It basically does. I don't remember league of legends having problems like that. Once you can just buy a specific skin from a list, it's not really special that you have it.
I would argue that trading card games are pretty scummy as well. They always become a game of who has more money to buy more cards. Bad systems are bad, whether other things are ALSO bad doesn't make a difference.
