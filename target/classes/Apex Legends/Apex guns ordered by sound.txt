[[Apex guns ordered by sound]]





What about hop-ups?

Peacekeeper /w choke would be bzzzzzzzt pggshh

devotion with turbocharger would be, "an apex champion has been decided"

Edit: thanks for the gold+silver!
    >devotion with turbocharger

do people still prefer this? ever since havoc came out i've been using it on that.
        I use Devotion Turbocharger and Select Fire Havoc... at the same time. Is it wrong to use two guns of the same ammo type?
            I cannot get the hang of the selectfire on it, I love to run havoc with turbo and trip take tho
                The selectfire makes it hitscan which means there is no bullet drop. Just point where you want the bullet to go and that’s where it will go.
                    I tried it once but the damage/Fire rate/ammo consumption didn’t compete with scout/longbow/wingman for the hitscan to be that good in my opinion. Probably easier for getting the 300m badge if you can’t adjust your aim to compensate bullet drop though.

I might be wrong on the damage. Literally I only tried it once and I remember it hit for 30 dmg or so. Might of hit a limb, not sure.
                        50 a body 100 a headshot if I’m right
                            It drops off quite a bit at range unlike most other weapons. The distance where hit scan is cool.is the distance where the damage is not.
                                That’s the main issue for me. Damage dropoff makes it frustrating to use
                                I hit 55s at pretty good distances.

Its obviously not a very optimal gun but its fun to use for early/mid game fights. 

But if they're *looking at you* with an R301 or a spitfire you are fucked.
                                    Can confirm, lost my virginity to an r301
                                    When I figured out how to select fire a R301 it became my favorite weapon
                                The drop-off doesn't make sense to me. It's hitscan since it's supposed to be super fast right? So why the drop-off? 
                                    BECAUSE it's hitscan, if it was hitscan and had no damage dropoff it would be Very overpowered, or it would have to have its base damage nerfed to where it wouldn't be fun to use at all, because a good player can hit a hitscan sniper shot most times, you'd be getting pinged by the havoc at distances you can't do anything about.
                                    Lazers are less focused over a longer distance I suppose
                                    agreed it seems stupid. hitscan weapons shouldnt have damage dropoff, thats the whole point of hitscan, its an instant damage where the reticle is
                            55 body.
                        Yea with select-fire it feels like a strictly worse version of a longbow
Edit: I believe at short range no armor it does 55 damage to the body like the longbow
                            I don't think that's the point. It's not supposed to be better than anything else, it's supposed to be more versatile.
                                I agree, in theory it gives you more options and is obviously better than running a havoc with no hop up. I just think it’s a little underpowered potentially. I don’t think it makes sense that the slow charging laser beam has so much damage drop off. As others have stated in this thread, if you are fighting at long distance where the hitscan is beneficial it does g7 scout level damage but much slower. I just feel that in most situations it is outclassed by most other guns unless you have turbo for it. Not saying this is inherently a bad thing as some guns should be weaker than others. And the havoc is pretty damn strong with turbo in my opinion.
                        It's the only gun with a drop in damage for long distance
                        At range it only does 30 per body shot (same as scout), but is significantly easier to hit people with. Seriously I can't hit shit with the scout at high range but I probably hit ~80% of the shots with the havoc. 

If you are able to get a close range shot in with the select fire, I think it can do damage similar to the longbow, but I think you're better off using the turbo charger at close range. 
                    It makes it hitscan but I don't think the damage is worth it.
                    Wait, what?!? The energy rounds don’t drop? That’s actually fucking awesome
                        No, energy rounds drop.

Every gun in the game is a projectile EXCEPT Havoc with Selectfire, which turns it into a hit scan, which means the shot instantly hits where you're aiming. A game can still have projectile bullets without having bullet drop as a mechanic.
                            Are you sure about this? The triple take still has travel time that you have to account for, but I've never had to use the mil dots to adjust for bullet drop. 
                                It does because it still has a rangefinder along with the drop measurements. The triple take just has the lowest bullet drop in the game, you don't have to adjust very much even at 200m. Notice the notches in the reticle are all extremely close together.
                                Triple take absolutely drop, you probably never used it in long enough distance.
                    It's hitscan, sure.

But it's also got that awful 1-2s windup before a shot goes off, which is arguably worse than dealing with drop/distance in terms of aiming.
                Okay more destiny with fusions, it’s like riding a bike when you get the hang of it. 

Fusions are my jam in destiny and have been since vanilla destiny. I really like the select fire 
                Triple Take with iron sights = BEST SHOTGUN!
            I find its preferential, only have to carry one ammo type
                Can be tough though if you end up not coming across much of that ammo. But it is convenient for sure.
                    Feels like energy ammo is more common now.
                        It is. They said specifically they upped the amount of energy ammo.
                    Yeah usually only do it for light and heavy. 
                I’m a big fan of the 99 and the 301 combo.
                    Ah yes, the close range automatic shotgun that shoots light ammo, and the midrange fully automatic sniper rifle that shoots light ammo, a great combo
                        A game winning combo
                        I prefer semi auto sniper mode R301 
                    PREACH
                    I can't get the hang of these two guns properly. They are inherently, the easiest seeming and every person who has played a video game has used a gun like this, but I just can't keep it steady enough. 

I've been finding single shot guns working well for me. Triple Take and Scout have been my go to lately. 
                        Do you like the peacemaker too?
                            I've think I like the Eva-8 better. I don't know why but I seem to be able to control the weapons better when I can just single click, but can still control how fast I click. The peacemaker I usually panic and dont time the click properly.
                                Yeah I know what you mean. I prefer the peacemaker, but every time I use it I have to mentally tell myself to relax and not panic-fire or else I’ll be toast...
                                    Ok I read this chain here and I can't take it anymore. It's the peacekeeper 
                I mean you have more stuff in stacks that way
            Nah I use Spitfire/wingman as often as I can
                Yea spitfire is top tier for me, especially with level 3 extended mag. I try to roll that and the Eva 8. Lot of people sleep on the Eva 8 but I think it’s amazing up close
                    Eva 8 is only better than a peacekeeper if you hit every shot and fast. Say you hit 3/5 with pk or eva8 you gonna win with the pk.
                        With a Peacekeeper I find I'm more focused on hitting individual shots VS with Eva 8 I just go buck wild spray-n-pray

My skill has gone way up after figuring out - not what the best guns are, but what seems to work best for me.

Spitfire/R99 ftw
                        Yeah but the Eva has a faster fire rate, so you can get off 3 shots before the PK gets 2. Assuming both players have the same level of aim, the fight comes down to who gets the first shot off and whether or not the PK has cover to duck behind.
                        I would have said the opposite.

Peacekeeper is only better if you hit every shot because you have to wait so long before you can shoot again.

Miss with the Eva8? Who cares? You can shoot again so quickly. 
            It's not wrong but you better be ready for some clutch punching
                I more than usual hear "Enemy over there" and then get killed as I'm pulling up my sights.
            Normally no but... with energy ammo? I can't imagine how you'd be able to maintain both.
            If anything it saves inventory space, although energy is the least efficient ammo to stack space wise
                Because you run through it so quickly or because it stacks in smaller stacks?
                    Smaller stacks mostly, although devotion can really eat through ammo if you aren't accurate enough to kill quickly so that's totally a factor
        Devotion's got higher damage than havoc and more ammo, its just that the first few bullets coming out of it are wonky as hell even with the turbocharger.
            Devotion makes 17, and havoc does 18 on auto.

Devotion has higher DPS tho
        I just prefer Devotion because of the bigger mag personally
            Imagine if there was an extended energy mag. Devotion would easily become a monster (more than it is now)
        When you get that spicy golden barrel stabilizer, havoc needs to be dropped immediately.
            lol I think i've gotten that attachment ONCE in all my time playing
                Good point. Still, devotion seems to be the best weapon to get out of an apex tick or something. 
                Wow, really? I've found it probably a dozen times at least. It's so unusual that I have decent RNG luck. But I think it all balances out because of how abysmal my Apex pack luck is.

*Cries in blues and whites*
        Spit fire is the best gun in the game imo.
            The thing I love about this game is, my favourite gun changes game to game. I'll be loving the spitfire. Ripping shit up with it. Then I won't find one and pick up a triple take and go 'holy shit, this gun is awesome'. It just keeps changing
                Yeah I almost never use the same 2 guns back to back. I think they are all pretty well balanced. Especially the Mozambique
                    Dude. I didn't even mention the Mozambique since I thought it was obvious to everyone here that it's everyone's favourite gun. Come on by for my MozamBBQ this weekend!
            Last night my two amateur hour squadmates both got wrecked in Bunker. But before I went in, I opened the supply bin I landed next to. Then I ran in and killed the entire enemy squad with a single magazine from the Spitfire that I found in the supply bin. The enemies were literally all just standing in the hallway and I lawnmowered them. 

Best gun.
        Does anyone know which has the higher dps? Devotion with turbocharger or havoc with turbocharger?

I've been assuming devotion since I thought there'd be a payoff for using a gun with multiple roles (havoc). I haven't checked the numbers myself though, and from these comments I'm starting to wonder if I'm wrong.
            Devotion's DPS and mag capacity is higher, but mobility and handling is worse by a long mile.
                May just be that I used devo for longer, but I still prefer the handling even on longer range.

            Carries a single pack of heavy ammo. 
        I like to have one precise weapon and one rapid fire. The longbow fulfils the first requirement and the second is usually a spitfire, but a turbocharged devotion will beat it out if I can find one.
        I prefer the Devotion because it can have a barrel stabilizer. The thing shreds if you get a good one and a turbocharger.
        Devotion has twice the capacity and still is an absolute shredder.
        Turbocharged devotion is devastating
        Havoc has less shots to shoot before reloading, and not by a small amount. 
        I think the havoc has lower recoil, but the devotion has a big mag and a really fast fire rate.
        I personally can't stand the havoc
        Devotion with turbocharger and gold barrel stabiliser is insane.
        I always feel Havoc as a shity Devotion version. Just like SpirtFire to flatline
        I think Havoc is definitely much more versatile than the devotion. Can absolutely shred up close, and can be sort of controlled at a medium distance. Also, it doesn’t go through energy ammo nearly as much. 
        I fucking hate the devotion... the spread on that gun is so filthy that it's not worth carrying for further than 25m and at that point I'd just rather have a shotgun so I can move faster
            initial recoil's a bitch yes, but after 1 second it's actually got accuracy between the r99-r301 range imo.
    > devotion with turbocharger would be, "an apex champion has been decided"

Have I been sleeping on this gun, or are you being sarcastic?
        It's not OP but it's pretty good. I'd take it over a lot of weapons.
            It’s not OP? Im not complaining, because I love it, but I feel like it’s god tier. 

short range doesn’t even need turbocharger. Medium range with turbo charger and a purple barrel make it unstoppable
                A fully revved up Devotion has the best* TTK in the game (besides crate drops) IIRC, but that's dependent on a variety of factors such as:

* Finding a Devotion with enough energy ammo
* Finding a turbocharger
* Being able to control the crazy recoil
* Enemies not ducking behind cover when they hear you start to fire

It's a great weapon, but so situational and easily countered I'd never call it OP.
                    Do you mean lowest time to kill? Highest TTK means it takes the longest to kill someone with it 
                        That's what I meant, haha. Will edit for clarity.
                its really broken with turbo charger the thing is you either have to have luck and find both early on or play half the game with a shit weapon or sacrifice inventory space ( for ammo and the turbo charger itself)
                    Honestly? I don't think it's that broken even with a turbo when you can take 140 damage from a single peacekeeper shot.
                        It's an B+ weapon. If you get all the right attachments with lots of ammo it's an A, but it's definately not OP or S tier like the Peacemaker. The R301 is so much more consistent and reliable for an auto weapon because it doesn't need much to be good.
                Agreed--I slept on it for a while, but started picking it up recently because I realized with or without the TBcharger it absolutely melts at medium and short range, and with the TBcharge its viable for medium range-somewhat longer range....most people don't pick up the turbocharger so even though it's gold I find it 50% of the time anyway...plus Devotion cancels out the need for me to be picky about my 2nd weapon (i.e. a peacekeeper or other short range weapon) so I can pair it with a R301 or, go short range and pick up Prowler which is God Tier with it's Hop Up (depending on which I end up finding first- the Extended Light Mag for R301 or SelectFire for Prowler.
        It's pretty intense as a bullet hose, I still prefer the Spitfire personally but it's worth trying.
            I use both. In the same match. The Spitfire suppresses and literally never runs out of ammo. The Devotion kills whole teams when they're all squat inside of the same tiny building being pussies.
                Yeah the spitfire is my go-to beccause it's purple clip seems endless so you can have prolonged fights without reloading
                Spitfire with purple just...keeps shooting
            The spitfire reigns supreme as a hose. It just obliterates people.
        It's pretty amazing with the hop up.. I wasn't using at all then a few days ago I kind of got stuck with it and ended up getting some kills then found it next game and got the hop up and was super impressed .. the gun is legit
        You probably haven't used it yet? I remember just pointing my turbo devotion in the general direction of 3-4 enemies, and all of them basically dropping instantly. It was in a hallway, but it was insane.
        It beats out all guns in 1v1 no movement flat plane sort of situations, but loses out whenever mobility is required.

Also those first three or four shots go wild.
        I feel like the base devotion is better than base spitfire, but once you get some good attachments (mainly the extended clip) then I use the spitfire
            Clips are what civvies use in their hair
                This is a magazine 
        i mean devotion in general is just way too good
        the advantage of the devotion is when you are in combat with someone who has anything but a spitfire and your gun keeps going while theirs stops, also you win vs spitfire if you are trading shots.
    Tbh my favorite is a spitfire with an extended heavy mag level three with a level three stabilizer. It **Shreds**.
        There’s a level 4 stabilizer actually, so that’s better. You can also put a stabilizer on-a devotion, so that’s also amazing. 

Spitfire is awesome too. LMGs feel so good in this game. 
            Yeah I think it’s more realistic to seek a level 3 stabilizer. I’ve only ever seen a level 4 or 5 times in game
                Don’t get me wrong, level 3 is great and more common, but according to my complex math calculations and degree from MIT, Stanford, and Oxford, 4>3.
                    Lmao. I just don’t depend on getting level four anything lmao. I simply build my arsenal choices out of the level three expectation (Or maybe even level 2 if I’m in a bad loot spot) because expecting a level four for a gun and sucking without it leaves me at a disadvantage.
                        But why would you say that a lower level attachment is your favorite? Like yeah you're way more likely to find a level 3 stabilizer but that doesn't mean you wouldn't prefer the 4.
                    The gold stabilizer just hides flash. Same reduction on recoil as the purp.
    Peacekeeper with precision choke is actually more of a wreeeeeeeeeeeee pggshh
Now this is finally a weapon chart worth sharing. I notice I seem to prefer Frrrrr and Bzjww guns over Phop phops, but a good Pggshh in the 2nd slot never hurts.
    I'm definitely a Phop phop kinda guy, but I can appreciate those who orient themselves with Skrrrrrr's and Frrrrrrrr's and even most Bzjwww's.
        Have you gotten around to trying the turbo charger on the Zbibibibibi or the Taak .. tak . tktktktktktktktktktktktktktktktktktkt yet? It’s life changing.
            I actually kinda like the Select Fire on the Zbibibibibi that turns it into a Waajeeee. I know its unlisted but gotta respect that damage if you can work with it.
                There is nothing more satisfying then the sound of a headshot from a Phhhhggggg

                        My girlfriend walked in as I was staring at my phone, quietly mouthing each sound, over and over. 
                My main loadout is a havoc with the a select fire. Turbo charger is cool. But the ability to switch from zbibibibi to waajeee is actually devastating.
                Bro that’s funny as fuck
    A lot of the time I don't Zbibibi hard enough, so I make sure I keep a secondary to Frrrrrrrrrrrrrr 'em off
        See I way prefer skrrrrrrr to frrrrrrrrr but that’s just me.

Screen readers, dude.
        Reddit is pretty popular among blind people, actually. It's an accessible site with plenty of text-based subs.
            I imagine r/writingprompts must be great for them
                Anywhere with a comments section is great for them (so, pretty much all of reddit). Just depends on what each person is interested in.

Nice
I make these sounds out loud when shooting and now I want this as a poster behind my screen. Well made 
I read these in the exact gun sound, nice work +1
Very informative but now in game I'll be say shit like " frrrrrrrrr here"
I can confirm that zbibibibi is exactly the sound of the Havoc.
I fucking love the what you did with the Devotion.
A true man of science. Well done.
big ups for making me sit at my desk, at work, and read these aloud.
In my opinion the mastiff is more like:  
Skrrrahh, pap, pap, ka-ka-ka  
Skidiki-pap-pap, and a pu-pu-pudrrrr-boom  
Skya, du-du-ku-ku-dun-dun  
Poom, poom, you dun know
Truly an echomimetic master.
Such an original post. Great work u/tarlohp.
NSFW dude..  I was sitting at work reading all of them out loud. My colleague asked me if I'm alright... ಠ_ಠ
Now this is some quality, original content ahhhhh
Had to share this on stream. Quality information here man!
r/dataisbeautiful
Aah, that's hot. That's hot
For some reason this is a really funny guide.
Now that’s a tier list
Am I the only one who made the noises with their mouth?
This post is so lame.
    This sub is lame
Frrrrrrrr tier is the best tier
How about Apex "Legends" ordered by sound?

Lifeline "**DEEBS**"
😂 zbibibibibibibi 
/r/suddenlygrime
This is the content I live for
Accurate. Can confirm these sounds are used when I play the game.
I can't even breathe because ZBIBIBIBIBIBIBIBIBIBIBIBIBI. I keep thinking of the most annoying gun in history from Borderlands.
***pew pew pew*** 

That's the silencer

***BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM***

That's the grenade launcher
If nobody used the Mozambique, does it really make a sound?
Quick mafs
Pggshh here!
[Gun sounds you say?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apg6OHOrhbQ)
Desiigner would probably shout these sounds into a future album or mixtape, but that's just a theory.

I’ll Bet anything you made some of these noises while reading them
Anybody else sit for a minute or two just making these sounds out loud? 
Thank you for this information, this is one giant leap for us all!
Spitfire and hemlock the two best guns. Change my mind 
Looks like Big Shaq's rhyme book....301 go skrrrrrr pop pop pop pop pop

First the subreddit upvotes "we should be able to bite ankles"

Now we're upvoting "sounds from a gun"

You guys are a joke of a subreddit 
Can I upvote this twice
Whoever made this does not pronounce things in English correctly.
    I'm actually dutch, so it might be my accent.
How many blunts did u smoke dude?
Nonsense, But god it's so good lol 
i made all of these sounds out loud
This is the most important post ever made on this sub
Phop 
I'm ashamed I had to do these sounds out loud to see if they are actually accurate.

&#x200B;

... they are.
That KingRichard meme is hilarious
Is there a chart that shows the amount of damage done per gun? Maybe even with added information on body shots vs headshots?

Looks like a new Rap "Song"
Skibidi papa
This just killed me.
Thanks, this is really useful!
Im getting weird looks at the doctors office

Wait
There need to be more zzz before the HAVOC while it warms up
It’s official, we need a battle pass.

BZJWWW got me good
I’ll be bursting the spitfire from now on
Yes
actually the wingman goes phop phop as well, but when you put a skullpiercer it goes bzjwww
Without select fire the prowler actually goes Frrrr (pause) frrrr (pause).
Fuck I just laughed so hard on the toilet.
My favorite gun is a taak .. tak . taktktktktktktktktktktktktktktktkt

But I prefer putting a turbocharger on it so it just goes:

tktktkktktktktkktktktkktktkktkt
Pgshh sucks.

SKRRRRRRR SKEESKE PSHHHHHH
PAPAPAPAPAPAPA
Don’t let big Shaq get his hands on this
TELL ME YOU DIDN'T JUST SIT THERE AND SAY IT ALL OUT LOUD WHILE YOU SIT ON THE TOILET
That devotion one tho!
Skrrrrrr mains stand up (not alternators tho, you can stand up and find the door)
HAHA i make these sound whenever im lazering a team
The chart we never knew we needed.
Seems legit
Um... Why is Mozambique in the list... It's clearly not a gun and it's a vibrator
I wish I knew this when I first started playing.  It really helps to know what your opponent is using.
Your dad is 44.
Peacekeeper is a bzjwww weapon and Wingman is Phop Phop, I think
I mean you should have the select fire variants too. Havoc sounds more like a weeee-PEW!!!!
haha
I love this
I'm definitely a papapapapa guy
Thank you
Hey I don't see no "pew pew peewwww"
Skrt skrt
And the ting goes SKKRRAAA skidi pap pap
Dat ting go skrr pop pop!
A man can never go wrong with a frrrrrrrr kinda fun. I left my wife for one of those babies
Thanks
I dont know what to do with this information
big shaq would be prooud
This... This is art.
I like to do the "Tutututu" that goes with the Havoc tbh
[deleted]
what's the gun that does the Sans sound? I always wondered
Omg, the quality of the post of this sub is going crazy. We need the Battle Pass asap!
Everyone knows the triple take goes Pwtoong!
Melee: PAAAP
My guns are definitely skrrrr
Now this is quality content
Great OC. Way too accurate.
Yes papa
I like to main a Papapapapa and the 3rd Bzjwww but I can swap that with a Skrrrrr every now and then
Triple take is more of a “Shhhhhpew”
There needs to be multiple sound categories for the havoc because it sounds completely different with the select fire equipped vs the turbocharger.
obviously R-99 and Prowler makes TRRRRRR instead Frrrrrrr, sorry but it is...
Can confirm this accurate. I sounded them all out.
I need this framed
Needs an SMG that goes dakdakdakdakdak
I always use a Papapapapa in the first slot and a frrrrrrrrrr in the second slot.
Not if you have the sound bug ;)
That’s what I’ve been doing wrong
A little bit of Papapapa with a bunch of Frrrrrrr
We really need a FREEEM!
Mozambique here
is it me or does the wingman sound way more intimidating when its shooting at you than when you’re shooting it
KARAKAKA 
The dutch can relate ;)
I like phopping
This is a weird tier list
R301 go skrrra papapapapa zbibi phop phop and a pggshh phggg
Wtfffffffffffff
When u dont own a car to make skrr sounds with, but you have an alternater
This is some next level shit posting.
Am I the only one who reproduced the sounds with my mouth? XD
10/1
[Can't be the only one that was thinking that while reading that sheet.](https://youtu.be/3fyAAea-OVc?t=98)
Phop phop
This is the only info chart that matters.
Honestly nearly every combination of guns in this game is usable. It’s perfectly balanced.
Nice bro
Thats crazy loo .. if had enough coins i would give you platinuim for this
***SKRRRRRT***
Looks like a tier list with the Mozambique at the top
When was the last time you slept?
first good reddit post in 2019
Taak.. tak. tktktktktktktktktktktktktktktktktktktktktktktktktktktktktktktktktktktktktktktktk.

That's exatly how the whole mag sounds like.
Are weapons dubbed by Kanye West?
The triple take for me sounds like TOOOOOM, TOOOOOM
Havok with the devotion pls
I don even now that exist this many guns on Apex!!
I laughed at myself while making those sounds because of how accurate it all is. XD

This post is awesome hahaha
Now we're starting to experience the No-Battle-Pass Shitposting Madness stage.
top tier shitpost
Tin goes skrrrraaaa
Looks like UK grime lyrics
Excuse me while I try to pronounce these sounds, excuse me if you have to sit next to enjoy your ride to your destination.
what am I going to do with this info
Have always been told I'd make a good papap one day
/r/dataisbeautiful
For me Havoc will be pew pew pew pew
Good ol devotion.
Please tell me I am not the only one that said all the sound out loud.
I thought the Mozambique made the "here here here here here here here" sound......
Feel the need to listen to Scatman John
Frrrrrrrr Skrrrrrrr my fav load out
But what does the fox say?
I didn't know how badly I needed this until I had it.
Can we talk about the G-7 Scout being a sniper rifle with light ammo??? The fuck.
If there was a expanded energy ammo magazine devotion would easily be the best gun in the the game.
The ting goes skrrrahh, pap, pap, ka-ka-ka
Skidiki-pap-pap, and a pu-pu-pudrrrr-boom
Skya, du-du-ku-ku-dun-dun
Poom, poom, you dun know
Skulpiersa ere! Peng-peng-peng
I literally described the devotion to a friend by making that noise out loud this is perfect bahahahhaa
See you in hot OP
Im saying all of them alone in my kitchen ..... I need to go out more
The alternator is more of a papapapapapa gun
Finally some useful stats
this is on popular and was posted an hour ago
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Huh nice one!
Brapp brapp. Pew pew.
The only tier list I need
Ahahah that is without any doubt the most useful classification I have seen ;p
Please share this to r/dataisbeautiful lmao
I'm really a fan of the phop phops
Hate the Havoc.
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0TBcJ4YX04Q
On an off note what is you guys’ favorite gun combos?
Devotion is the best one
The devotion is spot on without a turbo lol

First few shots are painfully slow, then the mag dumps before you can let your finger off the trigger button
Your missing the sound of disappointment when both of your squad is watching you in death boxes and you get shredded with a wingman while missing every shot.
I think the devotion is more reeeeeeeeeeeepipipipipipipipipipipipipipipipippipipi
Let's not forget about Lifeline's BLADOPP sound with a Care Package
Thermite grenades b like

Wow. I have never seen a sub devolve into madness so quickly. The games been out for a month and we're already at "r/wow 11 months into the last raid tier" levels of shitposting.
"You think I'm scared? Your gun goes RATATATATATTATTA but mine goes bwwwwwwwwwwww."
My God this is accurate.
For some reason I thought this was going to rank them from loudest to the most silent, I guess I was wrong...
The havoc is by far the worst sounding gun in the game. It makes me want to run away from combat when people fire it.
Mozambique here!
this is the worst thing
This game is too hard
Is it bad I did all these noises out loud infront of my dad?
It's like modern-day rap music!
I’ve never played this game. I feel like I was able to recreate the sounds based on your spelling. Good job
devotion has the scariest sound of all
Respawn should adapt this as their April Fools joke. Replace sounds of the guns firing with a recording of some dude reading this list.
now this.... this is golden
In this video your see most of apex legends Weapons and there sound. Hope you like it ➡️[apex legends weapons ](https://youtu.be/cZ0qp-aEugk)
PAPPAPPAP! That’s all I want to hear! Side not that reminds of the gym teacher in jump street when he yells
Looks like the lyrics to a new hit mumble rap track by Lil-Ape
These are all very well spelled. I've not played the game, but I'm pretty sure I could suitably recreate the sounds to someone that did play the game.
Where are the snipers on the map??
As someone who doesn’t play this game, I can hear all of these noises perfectly. Thank you
I think wingman is more of like a single PHOP.
Ah, so if you hear “Pgshh” you’re either already dead or someone else is committing suicide.
Did you just copy-paste the lyrics from Royce Da 5'9's *Gun Harmonizing*?
Im just sitting in my bathroom, making these noises and think: „damn, hes right!“
Ordered or categorized?
SKKKKRRRRRRRRRRRRR
Wingman sound gives me PTSD
shoutout to anyone who said it to themselves
"Tak" actually means "yes" in Polish. Makes devotion even sexier than it is.
Hmm, informative, not bitching about the battlepass. 

.. +1
God i hate you all, this game, and mostly all of you
This the kind of meta I've been looking for.
The Brrrrrrrrrt is superior to all other gun sounds.
Aren't these the lyrics to What Does the Fox Say?
Mozambique should be "RIP"
It's scary how accurate the triple take is. Just making the sound with my mouth made me picture aiming down stock sights, shooting at someone.
Nice, this is actually helpful. Thx.
"Skrrr.. pop"
Subscribe to PewDiePie sub gap is closing
I dunno I feel like the wingman and the eva-8 are more phop phop.
This is high quality content
you re wrong in one thing, im sure Prowler is like Prrrrr Prrrrr Prrrrr...

&#x200B;

Mozambique and EVA-8 is more like PZAH PZAH PZAH

&#x200B;

and P2020 is PGH PGH PGH PGH PGH
One of the best posts I've seen hands down
This is clearly a scientific analysis. Good work
Peacekeeper is a bzjwwww what are you talking about
Useful content, at last
Don't know if you guys run big home theater subs but that jackhammer is fucking amazing to shoot on my HT.
Wtf😂
This reminds me of something Gavin would say.
eva 8 is definitely “PAP PAP PAP” it sounds like a loud ass melee tbh

Take my upvote and get the fuck out of here
Skiddy pop pop
Whatcha talking about fool, the alternator is clearly dgkdgkdgkdgk
I hope they release a skiddy pop pop soon
Am I the only one that read through this list and made all the sounds out loud? Only after making each sound, did I then realize that this is fairly accurate. 
You forgot the "scooby doo papa" and the "rat tat tat tat tat"

I didn't know I needed this until now. 
What is this? Man's not hot?

Finally!
I'm gonna need a pivot table, thanks
what do i even do with this information? like im glad i have it but ???? what now
The type of quality content I enjoy. Please continue.
I’ll be sure to yell SKRR SKRR every single time i empty a magazine of r-301
Petition to make these official categories.

humanity just hit rock bottom....
Wingman sound is most certainly "CLACK"
This is critical Information 
>devotion with turbocharger

do people still prefer this? ever since havoc came out i've been using it on that.
    I use Devotion Turbocharger and Select Fire Havoc... at the same time. Is it wrong to use two guns of the same ammo type?
        I cannot get the hang of the selectfire on it, I love to run havoc with turbo and trip take tho
            The selectfire makes it hitscan which means there is no bullet drop. Just point where you want the bullet to go and that’s where it will go.
                I tried it once but the damage/Fire rate/ammo consumption didn’t compete with scout/longbow/wingman for the hitscan to be that good in my opinion. Probably easier for getting the 300m badge if you can’t adjust your aim to compensate bullet drop though.

I might be wrong on the damage. Literally I only tried it once and I remember it hit for 30 dmg or so. Might of hit a limb, not sure.
                    50 a body 100 a headshot if I’m right
                        It drops off quite a bit at range unlike most other weapons. The distance where hit scan is cool.is the distance where the damage is not.
                            That’s the main issue for me. Damage dropoff makes it frustrating to use
                            I hit 55s at pretty good distances.

Its obviously not a very optimal gun but its fun to use for early/mid game fights. 

But if they're *looking at you* with an R301 or a spitfire you are fucked.
                                Can confirm, lost my virginity to an r301
                                When I figured out how to select fire a R301 it became my favorite weapon
                            The drop-off doesn't make sense to me. It's hitscan since it's supposed to be super fast right? So why the drop-off? 
                                BECAUSE it's hitscan, if it was hitscan and had no damage dropoff it would be Very overpowered, or it would have to have its base damage nerfed to where it wouldn't be fun to use at all, because a good player can hit a hitscan sniper shot most times, you'd be getting pinged by the havoc at distances you can't do anything about.
                                Lazers are less focused over a longer distance I suppose
                                agreed it seems stupid. hitscan weapons shouldnt have damage dropoff, thats the whole point of hitscan, its an instant damage where the reticle is
                        55 body.
                    Yea with select-fire it feels like a strictly worse version of a longbow
Edit: I believe at short range no armor it does 55 damage to the body like the longbow
                        I don't think that's the point. It's not supposed to be better than anything else, it's supposed to be more versatile.
                            I agree, in theory it gives you more options and is obviously better than running a havoc with no hop up. I just think it’s a little underpowered potentially. I don’t think it makes sense that the slow charging laser beam has so much damage drop off. As others have stated in this thread, if you are fighting at long distance where the hitscan is beneficial it does g7 scout level damage but much slower. I just feel that in most situations it is outclassed by most other guns unless you have turbo for it. Not saying this is inherently a bad thing as some guns should be weaker than others. And the havoc is pretty damn strong with turbo in my opinion.
                    It's the only gun with a drop in damage for long distance
                    At range it only does 30 per body shot (same as scout), but is significantly easier to hit people with. Seriously I can't hit shit with the scout at high range but I probably hit ~80% of the shots with the havoc. 

If you are able to get a close range shot in with the select fire, I think it can do damage similar to the longbow, but I think you're better off using the turbo charger at close range. 
                It makes it hitscan but I don't think the damage is worth it.
                Wait, what?!? The energy rounds don’t drop? That’s actually fucking awesome
                    No, energy rounds drop.

Every gun in the game is a projectile EXCEPT Havoc with Selectfire, which turns it into a hit scan, which means the shot instantly hits where you're aiming. A game can still have projectile bullets without having bullet drop as a mechanic.
                        Are you sure about this? The triple take still has travel time that you have to account for, but I've never had to use the mil dots to adjust for bullet drop. 
                            It does because it still has a rangefinder along with the drop measurements. The triple take just has the lowest bullet drop in the game, you don't have to adjust very much even at 200m. Notice the notches in the reticle are all extremely close together.
                            Triple take absolutely drop, you probably never used it in long enough distance.
                It's hitscan, sure.

But it's also got that awful 1-2s windup before a shot goes off, which is arguably worse than dealing with drop/distance in terms of aiming.
            Okay more destiny with fusions, it’s like riding a bike when you get the hang of it. 

Fusions are my jam in destiny and have been since vanilla destiny. I really like the select fire 
            Triple Take with iron sights = BEST SHOTGUN!
        I find its preferential, only have to carry one ammo type
            Can be tough though if you end up not coming across much of that ammo. But it is convenient for sure.
                Feels like energy ammo is more common now.
                    It is. They said specifically they upped the amount of energy ammo.
                Yeah usually only do it for light and heavy. 
            I’m a big fan of the 99 and the 301 combo.
                Ah yes, the close range automatic shotgun that shoots light ammo, and the midrange fully automatic sniper rifle that shoots light ammo, a great combo
                    A game winning combo
                    I prefer semi auto sniper mode R301 
                PREACH
                I can't get the hang of these two guns properly. They are inherently, the easiest seeming and every person who has played a video game has used a gun like this, but I just can't keep it steady enough. 

I've been finding single shot guns working well for me. Triple Take and Scout have been my go to lately. 
                    Do you like the peacemaker too?
                        I've think I like the Eva-8 better. I don't know why but I seem to be able to control the weapons better when I can just single click, but can still control how fast I click. The peacemaker I usually panic and dont time the click properly.
                            Yeah I know what you mean. I prefer the peacemaker, but every time I use it I have to mentally tell myself to relax and not panic-fire or else I’ll be toast...
                                Ok I read this chain here and I can't take it anymore. It's the peacekeeper 
            I mean you have more stuff in stacks that way
        Nah I use Spitfire/wingman as often as I can
            Yea spitfire is top tier for me, especially with level 3 extended mag. I try to roll that and the Eva 8. Lot of people sleep on the Eva 8 but I think it’s amazing up close
                Eva 8 is only better than a peacekeeper if you hit every shot and fast. Say you hit 3/5 with pk or eva8 you gonna win with the pk.
                    With a Peacekeeper I find I'm more focused on hitting individual shots VS with Eva 8 I just go buck wild spray-n-pray

My skill has gone way up after figuring out - not what the best guns are, but what seems to work best for me.

Spitfire/R99 ftw
                    Yeah but the Eva has a faster fire rate, so you can get off 3 shots before the PK gets 2. Assuming both players have the same level of aim, the fight comes down to who gets the first shot off and whether or not the PK has cover to duck behind.
                    I would have said the opposite.

Peacekeeper is only better if you hit every shot because you have to wait so long before you can shoot again.

Miss with the Eva8? Who cares? You can shoot again so quickly. 
        It's not wrong but you better be ready for some clutch punching
            I more than usual hear "Enemy over there" and then get killed as I'm pulling up my sights.
        Normally no but... with energy ammo? I can't imagine how you'd be able to maintain both.
        If anything it saves inventory space, although energy is the least efficient ammo to stack space wise
            Because you run through it so quickly or because it stacks in smaller stacks?
                Smaller stacks mostly, although devotion can really eat through ammo if you aren't accurate enough to kill quickly so that's totally a factor
    Devotion's got higher damage than havoc and more ammo, its just that the first few bullets coming out of it are wonky as hell even with the turbocharger.
        Devotion makes 17, and havoc does 18 on auto.

Devotion has higher DPS tho
    I just prefer Devotion because of the bigger mag personally
        Imagine if there was an extended energy mag. Devotion would easily become a monster (more than it is now)
    When you get that spicy golden barrel stabilizer, havoc needs to be dropped immediately.
        lol I think i've gotten that attachment ONCE in all my time playing
            Good point. Still, devotion seems to be the best weapon to get out of an apex tick or something. 
            Wow, really? I've found it probably a dozen times at least. It's so unusual that I have decent RNG luck. But I think it all balances out because of how abysmal my Apex pack luck is.

*Cries in blues and whites*
    Spit fire is the best gun in the game imo.
        The thing I love about this game is, my favourite gun changes game to game. I'll be loving the spitfire. Ripping shit up with it. Then I won't find one and pick up a triple take and go 'holy shit, this gun is awesome'. It just keeps changing
            Yeah I almost never use the same 2 guns back to back. I think they are all pretty well balanced. Especially the Mozambique
                Dude. I didn't even mention the Mozambique since I thought it was obvious to everyone here that it's everyone's favourite gun. Come on by for my MozamBBQ this weekend!
        Last night my two amateur hour squadmates both got wrecked in Bunker. But before I went in, I opened the supply bin I landed next to. Then I ran in and killed the entire enemy squad with a single magazine from the Spitfire that I found in the supply bin. The enemies were literally all just standing in the hallway and I lawnmowered them. 

Best gun.
    Does anyone know which has the higher dps? Devotion with turbocharger or havoc with turbocharger?

I've been assuming devotion since I thought there'd be a payoff for using a gun with multiple roles (havoc). I haven't checked the numbers myself though, and from these comments I'm starting to wonder if I'm wrong.
        Devotion's DPS and mag capacity is higher, but mobility and handling is worse by a long mile.
            May just be that I used devo for longer, but I still prefer the handling even on longer range.

        Carries a single pack of heavy ammo. 
    I like to have one precise weapon and one rapid fire. The longbow fulfils the first requirement and the second is usually a spitfire, but a turbocharged devotion will beat it out if I can find one.
    I prefer the Devotion because it can have a barrel stabilizer. The thing shreds if you get a good one and a turbocharger.
    Devotion has twice the capacity and still is an absolute shredder.
    Turbocharged devotion is devastating
    Havoc has less shots to shoot before reloading, and not by a small amount. 
    I think the havoc has lower recoil, but the devotion has a big mag and a really fast fire rate.
    I personally can't stand the havoc
    Devotion with turbocharger and gold barrel stabiliser is insane.
    I always feel Havoc as a shity Devotion version. Just like SpirtFire to flatline
    I think Havoc is definitely much more versatile than the devotion. Can absolutely shred up close, and can be sort of controlled at a medium distance. Also, it doesn’t go through energy ammo nearly as much. 
    I fucking hate the devotion... the spread on that gun is so filthy that it's not worth carrying for further than 25m and at that point I'd just rather have a shotgun so I can move faster
        initial recoil's a bitch yes, but after 1 second it's actually got accuracy between the r99-r301 range imo.
> devotion with turbocharger would be, "an apex champion has been decided"

Have I been sleeping on this gun, or are you being sarcastic?
    It's not OP but it's pretty good. I'd take it over a lot of weapons.
        It’s not OP? Im not complaining, because I love it, but I feel like it’s god tier. 

short range doesn’t even need turbocharger. Medium range with turbo charger and a purple barrel make it unstoppable
            A fully revved up Devotion has the best* TTK in the game (besides crate drops) IIRC, but that's dependent on a variety of factors such as:

* Finding a Devotion with enough energy ammo
* Finding a turbocharger
* Being able to control the crazy recoil
* Enemies not ducking behind cover when they hear you start to fire

It's a great weapon, but so situational and easily countered I'd never call it OP.
                Do you mean lowest time to kill? Highest TTK means it takes the longest to kill someone with it 
                    That's what I meant, haha. Will edit for clarity.
            its really broken with turbo charger the thing is you either have to have luck and find both early on or play half the game with a shit weapon or sacrifice inventory space ( for ammo and the turbo charger itself)
                Honestly? I don't think it's that broken even with a turbo when you can take 140 damage from a single peacekeeper shot.
                    It's an B+ weapon. If you get all the right attachments with lots of ammo it's an A, but it's definately not OP or S tier like the Peacemaker. The R301 is so much more consistent and reliable for an auto weapon because it doesn't need much to be good.
            Agreed--I slept on it for a while, but started picking it up recently because I realized with or without the TBcharger it absolutely melts at medium and short range, and with the TBcharge its viable for medium range-somewhat longer range....most people don't pick up the turbocharger so even though it's gold I find it 50% of the time anyway...plus Devotion cancels out the need for me to be picky about my 2nd weapon (i.e. a peacekeeper or other short range weapon) so I can pair it with a R301 or, go short range and pick up Prowler which is God Tier with it's Hop Up (depending on which I end up finding first- the Extended Light Mag for R301 or SelectFire for Prowler.
    It's pretty intense as a bullet hose, I still prefer the Spitfire personally but it's worth trying.
        I use both. In the same match. The Spitfire suppresses and literally never runs out of ammo. The Devotion kills whole teams when they're all squat inside of the same tiny building being pussies.
            Yeah the spitfire is my go-to beccause it's purple clip seems endless so you can have prolonged fights without reloading
            Spitfire with purple just...keeps shooting
        The spitfire reigns supreme as a hose. It just obliterates people.
    It's pretty amazing with the hop up.. I wasn't using at all then a few days ago I kind of got stuck with it and ended up getting some kills then found it next game and got the hop up and was super impressed .. the gun is legit
    You probably haven't used it yet? I remember just pointing my turbo devotion in the general direction of 3-4 enemies, and all of them basically dropping instantly. It was in a hallway, but it was insane.
    It beats out all guns in 1v1 no movement flat plane sort of situations, but loses out whenever mobility is required.

Also those first three or four shots go wild.
    I feel like the base devotion is better than base spitfire, but once you get some good attachments (mainly the extended clip) then I use the spitfire
        Clips are what civvies use in their hair
            This is a magazine 
    i mean devotion in general is just way too good
    the advantage of the devotion is when you are in combat with someone who has anything but a spitfire and your gun keeps going while theirs stops, also you win vs spitfire if you are trading shots.
Tbh my favorite is a spitfire with an extended heavy mag level three with a level three stabilizer. It **Shreds**.
    There’s a level 4 stabilizer actually, so that’s better. You can also put a stabilizer on-a devotion, so that’s also amazing. 

Spitfire is awesome too. LMGs feel so good in this game. 
        Yeah I think it’s more realistic to seek a level 3 stabilizer. I’ve only ever seen a level 4 or 5 times in game
            Don’t get me wrong, level 3 is great and more common, but according to my complex math calculations and degree from MIT, Stanford, and Oxford, 4>3.
                Lmao. I just don’t depend on getting level four anything lmao. I simply build my arsenal choices out of the level three expectation (Or maybe even level 2 if I’m in a bad loot spot) because expecting a level four for a gun and sucking without it leaves me at a disadvantage.
                    But why would you say that a lower level attachment is your favorite? Like yeah you're way more likely to find a level 3 stabilizer but that doesn't mean you wouldn't prefer the 4.
                The gold stabilizer just hides flash. Same reduction on recoil as the purp.
Peacekeeper with precision choke is actually more of a wreeeeeeeeeeeee pggshh
I'm definitely a Phop phop kinda guy, but I can appreciate those who orient themselves with Skrrrrrr's and Frrrrrrrr's and even most Bzjwww's.
    Have you gotten around to trying the turbo charger on the Zbibibibibi or the Taak .. tak . tktktktktktktktktktktktktktktktktktkt yet? It’s life changing.
        I actually kinda like the Select Fire on the Zbibibibibi that turns it into a Waajeeee. I know its unlisted but gotta respect that damage if you can work with it.
            There is nothing more satisfying then the sound of a headshot from a Phhhhggggg
                I'm having a stroke

                    My girlfriend walked in as I was staring at my phone, quietly mouthing each sound, over and over. 
            My main loadout is a havoc with the a select fire. Turbo charger is cool. But the ability to switch from zbibibibi to waajeee is actually devastating.
            Bro that’s funny as fuck
A lot of the time I don't Zbibibi hard enough, so I make sure I keep a secondary to Frrrrrrrrrrrrrr 'em off
    See I way prefer skrrrrrrr to frrrrrrrrr but that’s just me.

I use Devotion Turbocharger and Select Fire Havoc... at the same time. Is it wrong to use two guns of the same ammo type?
    I cannot get the hang of the selectfire on it, I love to run havoc with turbo and trip take tho
        The selectfire makes it hitscan which means there is no bullet drop. Just point where you want the bullet to go and that’s where it will go.
            I tried it once but the damage/Fire rate/ammo consumption didn’t compete with scout/longbow/wingman for the hitscan to be that good in my opinion. Probably easier for getting the 300m badge if you can’t adjust your aim to compensate bullet drop though.

I might be wrong on the damage. Literally I only tried it once and I remember it hit for 30 dmg or so. Might of hit a limb, not sure.
                50 a body 100 a headshot if I’m right
                    It drops off quite a bit at range unlike most other weapons. The distance where hit scan is cool.is the distance where the damage is not.
                        That’s the main issue for me. Damage dropoff makes it frustrating to use
                        I hit 55s at pretty good distances.

Its obviously not a very optimal gun but its fun to use for early/mid game fights. 

But if they're *looking at you* with an R301 or a spitfire you are fucked.
                            Can confirm, lost my virginity to an r301
                            When I figured out how to select fire a R301 it became my favorite weapon
                        The drop-off doesn't make sense to me. It's hitscan since it's supposed to be super fast right? So why the drop-off? 
                            BECAUSE it's hitscan, if it was hitscan and had no damage dropoff it would be Very overpowered, or it would have to have its base damage nerfed to where it wouldn't be fun to use at all, because a good player can hit a hitscan sniper shot most times, you'd be getting pinged by the havoc at distances you can't do anything about.
                            Lazers are less focused over a longer distance I suppose
                            agreed it seems stupid. hitscan weapons shouldnt have damage dropoff, thats the whole point of hitscan, its an instant damage where the reticle is
                    55 body.
                Yea with select-fire it feels like a strictly worse version of a longbow
Edit: I believe at short range no armor it does 55 damage to the body like the longbow
                    I don't think that's the point. It's not supposed to be better than anything else, it's supposed to be more versatile.
                        I agree, in theory it gives you more options and is obviously better than running a havoc with no hop up. I just think it’s a little underpowered potentially. I don’t think it makes sense that the slow charging laser beam has so much damage drop off. As others have stated in this thread, if you are fighting at long distance where the hitscan is beneficial it does g7 scout level damage but much slower. I just feel that in most situations it is outclassed by most other guns unless you have turbo for it. Not saying this is inherently a bad thing as some guns should be weaker than others. And the havoc is pretty damn strong with turbo in my opinion.
                It's the only gun with a drop in damage for long distance
                At range it only does 30 per body shot (same as scout), but is significantly easier to hit people with. Seriously I can't hit shit with the scout at high range but I probably hit ~80% of the shots with the havoc. 

If you are able to get a close range shot in with the select fire, I think it can do damage similar to the longbow, but I think you're better off using the turbo charger at close range. 
            It makes it hitscan but I don't think the damage is worth it.
            Wait, what?!? The energy rounds don’t drop? That’s actually fucking awesome
                No, energy rounds drop.

Every gun in the game is a projectile EXCEPT Havoc with Selectfire, which turns it into a hit scan, which means the shot instantly hits where you're aiming. A game can still have projectile bullets without having bullet drop as a mechanic.
                    Are you sure about this? The triple take still has travel time that you have to account for, but I've never had to use the mil dots to adjust for bullet drop. 
                        It does because it still has a rangefinder along with the drop measurements. The triple take just has the lowest bullet drop in the game, you don't have to adjust very much even at 200m. Notice the notches in the reticle are all extremely close together.
                        Triple take absolutely drop, you probably never used it in long enough distance.
            It's hitscan, sure.

But it's also got that awful 1-2s windup before a shot goes off, which is arguably worse than dealing with drop/distance in terms of aiming.
        Okay more destiny with fusions, it’s like riding a bike when you get the hang of it. 

Fusions are my jam in destiny and have been since vanilla destiny. I really like the select fire 
        Triple Take with iron sights = BEST SHOTGUN!
    I find its preferential, only have to carry one ammo type
        Can be tough though if you end up not coming across much of that ammo. But it is convenient for sure.
            Feels like energy ammo is more common now.
                It is. They said specifically they upped the amount of energy ammo.
            Yeah usually only do it for light and heavy. 
        I’m a big fan of the 99 and the 301 combo.
            Ah yes, the close range automatic shotgun that shoots light ammo, and the midrange fully automatic sniper rifle that shoots light ammo, a great combo
                A game winning combo
                I prefer semi auto sniper mode R301 
            PREACH
            I can't get the hang of these two guns properly. They are inherently, the easiest seeming and every person who has played a video game has used a gun like this, but I just can't keep it steady enough. 

I've been finding single shot guns working well for me. Triple Take and Scout have been my go to lately. 
                Do you like the peacemaker too?
                    I've think I like the Eva-8 better. I don't know why but I seem to be able to control the weapons better when I can just single click, but can still control how fast I click. The peacemaker I usually panic and dont time the click properly.
                        Yeah I know what you mean. I prefer the peacemaker, but every time I use it I have to mentally tell myself to relax and not panic-fire or else I’ll be toast...
                            Ok I read this chain here and I can't take it anymore. It's the peacekeeper 
        I mean you have more stuff in stacks that way
    Nah I use Spitfire/wingman as often as I can
        Yea spitfire is top tier for me, especially with level 3 extended mag. I try to roll that and the Eva 8. Lot of people sleep on the Eva 8 but I think it’s amazing up close
            Eva 8 is only better than a peacekeeper if you hit every shot and fast. Say you hit 3/5 with pk or eva8 you gonna win with the pk.
                With a Peacekeeper I find I'm more focused on hitting individual shots VS with Eva 8 I just go buck wild spray-n-pray

My skill has gone way up after figuring out - not what the best guns are, but what seems to work best for me.

Spitfire/R99 ftw
                Yeah but the Eva has a faster fire rate, so you can get off 3 shots before the PK gets 2. Assuming both players have the same level of aim, the fight comes down to who gets the first shot off and whether or not the PK has cover to duck behind.
                I would have said the opposite.

Peacekeeper is only better if you hit every shot because you have to wait so long before you can shoot again.

Miss with the Eva8? Who cares? You can shoot again so quickly. 
    It's not wrong but you better be ready for some clutch punching
        I more than usual hear "Enemy over there" and then get killed as I'm pulling up my sights.
    Normally no but... with energy ammo? I can't imagine how you'd be able to maintain both.
    If anything it saves inventory space, although energy is the least efficient ammo to stack space wise
        Because you run through it so quickly or because it stacks in smaller stacks?
            Smaller stacks mostly, although devotion can really eat through ammo if you aren't accurate enough to kill quickly so that's totally a factor
Devotion's got higher damage than havoc and more ammo, its just that the first few bullets coming out of it are wonky as hell even with the turbocharger.
    Devotion makes 17, and havoc does 18 on auto.

Devotion has higher DPS tho
I just prefer Devotion because of the bigger mag personally
    Imagine if there was an extended energy mag. Devotion would easily become a monster (more than it is now)
When you get that spicy golden barrel stabilizer, havoc needs to be dropped immediately.
    lol I think i've gotten that attachment ONCE in all my time playing
        Good point. Still, devotion seems to be the best weapon to get out of an apex tick or something. 
        Wow, really? I've found it probably a dozen times at least. It's so unusual that I have decent RNG luck. But I think it all balances out because of how abysmal my Apex pack luck is.

*Cries in blues and whites*
Spit fire is the best gun in the game imo.
    The thing I love about this game is, my favourite gun changes game to game. I'll be loving the spitfire. Ripping shit up with it. Then I won't find one and pick up a triple take and go 'holy shit, this gun is awesome'. It just keeps changing
        Yeah I almost never use the same 2 guns back to back. I think they are all pretty well balanced. Especially the Mozambique
            Dude. I didn't even mention the Mozambique since I thought it was obvious to everyone here that it's everyone's favourite gun. Come on by for my MozamBBQ this weekend!
    Last night my two amateur hour squadmates both got wrecked in Bunker. But before I went in, I opened the supply bin I landed next to. Then I ran in and killed the entire enemy squad with a single magazine from the Spitfire that I found in the supply bin. The enemies were literally all just standing in the hallway and I lawnmowered them. 

Best gun.
Does anyone know which has the higher dps? Devotion with turbocharger or havoc with turbocharger?

I've been assuming devotion since I thought there'd be a payoff for using a gun with multiple roles (havoc). I haven't checked the numbers myself though, and from these comments I'm starting to wonder if I'm wrong.
    Devotion's DPS and mag capacity is higher, but mobility and handling is worse by a long mile.
        May just be that I used devo for longer, but I still prefer the handling even on longer range.

the advantage of the devotion is when you are in combat with someone who has anything but a spitfire and your gun keeps going while theirs stops, also you win vs spitfire if you are trading shots.
There’s a level 4 stabilizer actually, so that’s better. You can also put a stabilizer on-a devotion, so that’s also amazing. 

Spitfire is awesome too. LMGs feel so good in this game. 
    Yeah I think it’s more realistic to seek a level 3 stabilizer. I’ve only ever seen a level 4 or 5 times in game
        Don’t get me wrong, level 3 is great and more common, but according to my complex math calculations and degree from MIT, Stanford, and Oxford, 4>3.
            Lmao. I just don’t depend on getting level four anything lmao. I simply build my arsenal choices out of the level three expectation (Or maybe even level 2 if I’m in a bad loot spot) because expecting a level four for a gun and sucking without it leaves me at a disadvantage.
                But why would you say that a lower level attachment is your favorite? Like yeah you're way more likely to find a level 3 stabilizer but that doesn't mean you wouldn't prefer the 4.
            The gold stabilizer just hides flash. Same reduction on recoil as the purp.
Have you gotten around to trying the turbo charger on the Zbibibibibi or the Taak .. tak . tktktktktktktktktktktktktktktktktktkt yet? It’s life changing.
    I actually kinda like the Select Fire on the Zbibibibibi that turns it into a Waajeeee. I know its unlisted but gotta respect that damage if you can work with it.
        There is nothing more satisfying then the sound of a headshot from a Phhhhggggg
            I'm having a stroke
                yes this comment thread right here officer sir
                    Happy cake day
                        thank you!
                My girlfriend walked in as I was staring at my phone, quietly mouthing each sound, over and over. 
        My main loadout is a havoc with the a select fire. Turbo charger is cool. But the ability to switch from zbibibibi to waajeee is actually devastating.
        Bro that’s funny as fuck
See I way prefer skrrrrrrr to frrrrrrrrr but that’s just me.
And a BO BO BO BOOOOOM BOOOM
    SKKKYAAAA
        BOOM

You dun now
            That was the guy with a backpack full of nades.
                I actually carry a backpack filled 80% with nades and rest with ammo xd
                    No shields?
                        No,enemies can't damage you if they are dead

Screen readers, dude.
Reddit is pretty popular among blind people, actually. It's an accessible site with plenty of text-based subs.
    I imagine r/writingprompts must be great for them
        Anywhere with a comments section is great for them (so, pretty much all of reddit). Just depends on what each person is interested in.

God damnit I love reddit
I cannot get the hang of the selectfire on it, I love to run havoc with turbo and trip take tho
    The selectfire makes it hitscan which means there is no bullet drop. Just point where you want the bullet to go and that’s where it will go.
        I tried it once but the damage/Fire rate/ammo consumption didn’t compete with scout/longbow/wingman for the hitscan to be that good in my opinion. Probably easier for getting the 300m badge if you can’t adjust your aim to compensate bullet drop though.

I might be wrong on the damage. Literally I only tried it once and I remember it hit for 30 dmg or so. Might of hit a limb, not sure.
            50 a body 100 a headshot if I’m right
                It drops off quite a bit at range unlike most other weapons. The distance where hit scan is cool.is the distance where the damage is not.
                    That’s the main issue for me. Damage dropoff makes it frustrating to use
                    I hit 55s at pretty good distances.

Its obviously not a very optimal gun but its fun to use for early/mid game fights. 

But if they're *looking at you* with an R301 or a spitfire you are fucked.
                        Can confirm, lost my virginity to an r301
                        When I figured out how to select fire a R301 it became my favorite weapon
                    The drop-off doesn't make sense to me. It's hitscan since it's supposed to be super fast right? So why the drop-off? 
                        BECAUSE it's hitscan, if it was hitscan and had no damage dropoff it would be Very overpowered, or it would have to have its base damage nerfed to where it wouldn't be fun to use at all, because a good player can hit a hitscan sniper shot most times, you'd be getting pinged by the havoc at distances you can't do anything about.
                        Lazers are less focused over a longer distance I suppose
                        agreed it seems stupid. hitscan weapons shouldnt have damage dropoff, thats the whole point of hitscan, its an instant damage where the reticle is
                55 body.
            Yea with select-fire it feels like a strictly worse version of a longbow
Edit: I believe at short range no armor it does 55 damage to the body like the longbow
                I don't think that's the point. It's not supposed to be better than anything else, it's supposed to be more versatile.
                    I agree, in theory it gives you more options and is obviously better than running a havoc with no hop up. I just think it’s a little underpowered potentially. I don’t think it makes sense that the slow charging laser beam has so much damage drop off. As others have stated in this thread, if you are fighting at long distance where the hitscan is beneficial it does g7 scout level damage but much slower. I just feel that in most situations it is outclassed by most other guns unless you have turbo for it. Not saying this is inherently a bad thing as some guns should be weaker than others. And the havoc is pretty damn strong with turbo in my opinion.
            It's the only gun with a drop in damage for long distance
            At range it only does 30 per body shot (same as scout), but is significantly easier to hit people with. Seriously I can't hit shit with the scout at high range but I probably hit ~80% of the shots with the havoc. 

If you are able to get a close range shot in with the select fire, I think it can do damage similar to the longbow, but I think you're better off using the turbo charger at close range. 
        It makes it hitscan but I don't think the damage is worth it.
        Wait, what?!? The energy rounds don’t drop? That’s actually fucking awesome
            No, energy rounds drop.

Every gun in the game is a projectile EXCEPT Havoc with Selectfire, which turns it into a hit scan, which means the shot instantly hits where you're aiming. A game can still have projectile bullets without having bullet drop as a mechanic.
                Are you sure about this? The triple take still has travel time that you have to account for, but I've never had to use the mil dots to adjust for bullet drop. 
                    It does because it still has a rangefinder along with the drop measurements. The triple take just has the lowest bullet drop in the game, you don't have to adjust very much even at 200m. Notice the notches in the reticle are all extremely close together.
                    Triple take absolutely drop, you probably never used it in long enough distance.
        It's hitscan, sure.

But it's also got that awful 1-2s windup before a shot goes off, which is arguably worse than dealing with drop/distance in terms of aiming.
    Okay more destiny with fusions, it’s like riding a bike when you get the hang of it. 

Fusions are my jam in destiny and have been since vanilla destiny. I really like the select fire 
    Triple Take with iron sights = BEST SHOTGUN!
I find its preferential, only have to carry one ammo type
    Can be tough though if you end up not coming across much of that ammo. But it is convenient for sure.
        Feels like energy ammo is more common now.
            It is. They said specifically they upped the amount of energy ammo.
        Yeah usually only do it for light and heavy. 
    I’m a big fan of the 99 and the 301 combo.
        Ah yes, the close range automatic shotgun that shoots light ammo, and the midrange fully automatic sniper rifle that shoots light ammo, a great combo
            A game winning combo
            I prefer semi auto sniper mode R301 
        PREACH
        I can't get the hang of these two guns properly. They are inherently, the easiest seeming and every person who has played a video game has used a gun like this, but I just can't keep it steady enough. 

I've been finding single shot guns working well for me. Triple Take and Scout have been my go to lately. 
            Do you like the peacemaker too?
                I've think I like the Eva-8 better. I don't know why but I seem to be able to control the weapons better when I can just single click, but can still control how fast I click. The peacemaker I usually panic and dont time the click properly.
                    Yeah I know what you mean. I prefer the peacemaker, but every time I use it I have to mentally tell myself to relax and not panic-fire or else I’ll be toast...
                        Ok I read this chain here and I can't take it anymore. It's the peacekeeper 
    I mean you have more stuff in stacks that way
Nah I use Spitfire/wingman as often as I can
    Yea spitfire is top tier for me, especially with level 3 extended mag. I try to roll that and the Eva 8. Lot of people sleep on the Eva 8 but I think it’s amazing up close
        Eva 8 is only better than a peacekeeper if you hit every shot and fast. Say you hit 3/5 with pk or eva8 you gonna win with the pk.
            With a Peacekeeper I find I'm more focused on hitting individual shots VS with Eva 8 I just go buck wild spray-n-pray

My skill has gone way up after figuring out - not what the best guns are, but what seems to work best for me.

Spitfire/R99 ftw
            Yeah but the Eva has a faster fire rate, so you can get off 3 shots before the PK gets 2. Assuming both players have the same level of aim, the fight comes down to who gets the first shot off and whether or not the PK has cover to duck behind.
            I would have said the opposite.

Peacekeeper is only better if you hit every shot because you have to wait so long before you can shoot again.

Miss with the Eva8? Who cares? You can shoot again so quickly. 
It's not wrong but you better be ready for some clutch punching
    I more than usual hear "Enemy over there" and then get killed as I'm pulling up my sights.
Normally no but... with energy ammo? I can't imagine how you'd be able to maintain both.
If anything it saves inventory space, although energy is the least efficient ammo to stack space wise
    Because you run through it so quickly or because it stacks in smaller stacks?
        Smaller stacks mostly, although devotion can really eat through ammo if you aren't accurate enough to kill quickly so that's totally a factor
Devotion makes 17, and havoc does 18 on auto.

Devotion has higher DPS tho
Imagine if there was an extended energy mag. Devotion would easily become a monster (more than it is now)
lol I think i've gotten that attachment ONCE in all my time playing
    Good point. Still, devotion seems to be the best weapon to get out of an apex tick or something. 
    Wow, really? I've found it probably a dozen times at least. It's so unusual that I have decent RNG luck. But I think it all balances out because of how abysmal my Apex pack luck is.

*Cries in blues and whites*
The thing I love about this game is, my favourite gun changes game to game. I'll be loving the spitfire. Ripping shit up with it. Then I won't find one and pick up a triple take and go 'holy shit, this gun is awesome'. It just keeps changing
    Yeah I almost never use the same 2 guns back to back. I think they are all pretty well balanced. Especially the Mozambique
        Dude. I didn't even mention the Mozambique since I thought it was obvious to everyone here that it's everyone's favourite gun. Come on by for my MozamBBQ this weekend!
Last night my two amateur hour squadmates both got wrecked in Bunker. But before I went in, I opened the supply bin I landed next to. Then I ran in and killed the entire enemy squad with a single magazine from the Spitfire that I found in the supply bin. The enemies were literally all just standing in the hallway and I lawnmowered them. 

Best gun.
Devotion's DPS and mag capacity is higher, but mobility and handling is worse by a long mile.
    May just be that I used devo for longer, but I still prefer the handling even on longer range.
Carries a single pack of heavy ammo. 
initial recoil's a bitch yes, but after 1 second it's actually got accuracy between the r99-r301 range imo.
It’s not OP? Im not complaining, because I love it, but I feel like it’s god tier. 

short range doesn’t even need turbocharger. Medium range with turbo charger and a purple barrel make it unstoppable
    A fully revved up Devotion has the best* TTK in the game (besides crate drops) IIRC, but that's dependent on a variety of factors such as:

* Finding a Devotion with enough energy ammo
* Finding a turbocharger
* Being able to control the crazy recoil
* Enemies not ducking behind cover when they hear you start to fire

It's a great weapon, but so situational and easily countered I'd never call it OP.
        Do you mean lowest time to kill? Highest TTK means it takes the longest to kill someone with it 
            That's what I meant, haha. Will edit for clarity.
    its really broken with turbo charger the thing is you either have to have luck and find both early on or play half the game with a shit weapon or sacrifice inventory space ( for ammo and the turbo charger itself)
        Honestly? I don't think it's that broken even with a turbo when you can take 140 damage from a single peacekeeper shot.
            It's an B+ weapon. If you get all the right attachments with lots of ammo it's an A, but it's definately not OP or S tier like the Peacemaker. The R301 is so much more consistent and reliable for an auto weapon because it doesn't need much to be good.
    Agreed--I slept on it for a while, but started picking it up recently because I realized with or without the TBcharger it absolutely melts at medium and short range, and with the TBcharge its viable for medium range-somewhat longer range....most people don't pick up the turbocharger so even though it's gold I find it 50% of the time anyway...plus Devotion cancels out the need for me to be picky about my 2nd weapon (i.e. a peacekeeper or other short range weapon) so I can pair it with a R301 or, go short range and pick up Prowler which is God Tier with it's Hop Up (depending on which I end up finding first- the Extended Light Mag for R301 or SelectFire for Prowler.
I use both. In the same match. The Spitfire suppresses and literally never runs out of ammo. The Devotion kills whole teams when they're all squat inside of the same tiny building being pussies.
    Yeah the spitfire is my go-to beccause it's purple clip seems endless so you can have prolonged fights without reloading
    Spitfire with purple just...keeps shooting
The spitfire reigns supreme as a hose. It just obliterates people.
Clips are what civvies use in their hair

Yeah I think it’s more realistic to seek a level 3 stabilizer. I’ve only ever seen a level 4 or 5 times in game

May just be that I used devo for longer, but I still prefer the handling even on longer range.
A fully revved up Devotion has the best* TTK in the game (besides crate drops) IIRC, but that's dependent on a variety of factors such as:

* Finding a Devotion with enough energy ammo
* Finding a turbocharger
* Being able to control the crazy recoil
* Enemies not ducking behind cover when they hear you start to fire

It's a great weapon, but so situational and easily countered I'd never call it OP.
    Do you mean lowest time to kill? Highest TTK means it takes the longest to kill someone with it 
        That's what I meant, haha. Will edit for clarity.
its really broken with turbo charger the thing is you either have to have luck and find both early on or play half the game with a shit weapon or sacrifice inventory space ( for ammo and the turbo charger itself)
    Honestly? I don't think it's that broken even with a turbo when you can take 140 damage from a single peacekeeper shot.
        It's an B+ weapon. If you get all the right attachments with lots of ammo it's an A, but it's definately not OP or S tier like the Peacemaker. The R301 is so much more consistent and reliable for an auto weapon because it doesn't need much to be good.
Agreed--I slept on it for a while, but started picking it up recently because I realized with or without the TBcharger it absolutely melts at medium and short range, and with the TBcharge its viable for medium range-somewhat longer range....most people don't pick up the turbocharger so even though it's gold I find it 50% of the time anyway...plus Devotion cancels out the need for me to be picky about my 2nd weapon (i.e. a peacekeeper or other short range weapon) so I can pair it with a R301 or, go short range and pick up Prowler which is God Tier with it's Hop Up (depending on which I end up finding first- the Extended Light Mag for R301 or SelectFire for Prowler.
Yeah the spitfire is my go-to beccause it's purple clip seems endless so you can have prolonged fights without reloading
Spitfire with purple just...keeps shooting
This is a magazine 
Don’t get me wrong, level 3 is great and more common, but according to my complex math calculations and degree from MIT, Stanford, and Oxford, 4>3.
    Lmao. I just don’t depend on getting level four anything lmao. I simply build my arsenal choices out of the level three expectation (Or maybe even level 2 if I’m in a bad loot spot) because expecting a level four for a gun and sucking without it leaves me at a disadvantage.
        But why would you say that a lower level attachment is your favorite? Like yeah you're way more likely to find a level 3 stabilizer but that doesn't mean you wouldn't prefer the 4.
    The gold stabilizer just hides flash. Same reduction on recoil as the purp.
There is nothing more satisfying then the sound of a headshot from a Phhhhggggg
    I'm having a stroke
        yes this comment thread right here officer sir
            Happy cake day
                thank you!
        My girlfriend walked in as I was staring at my phone, quietly mouthing each sound, over and over. 
My main loadout is a havoc with the a select fire. Turbo charger is cool. But the ability to switch from zbibibibi to waajeee is actually devastating.
Bro that’s funny as fuck
BOOM

You dun now
    That was the guy with a backpack full of nades.
        I actually carry a backpack filled 80% with nades and rest with ammo xd
            No shields?
                No,enemies can't damage you if they are dead
                Shields are for posers
Raw sauce
Anywhere with a comments section is great for them (so, pretty much all of reddit). Just depends on what each person is interested in. 
I tried it once but the damage/Fire rate/ammo consumption didn’t compete with scout/longbow/wingman for the hitscan to be that good in my opinion. Probably easier for getting the 300m badge if you can’t adjust your aim to compensate bullet drop though.

I might be wrong on the damage. Literally I only tried it once and I remember it hit for 30 dmg or so. Might of hit a limb, not sure.
    50 a body 100 a headshot if I’m right
        It drops off quite a bit at range unlike most other weapons. The distance where hit scan is cool.is the distance where the damage is not.
            That’s the main issue for me. Damage dropoff makes it frustrating to use
            I hit 55s at pretty good distances.

Its obviously not a very optimal gun but its fun to use for early/mid game fights. 

But if they're *looking at you* with an R301 or a spitfire you are fucked.
                Can confirm, lost my virginity to an r301
                When I figured out how to select fire a R301 it became my favorite weapon
            The drop-off doesn't make sense to me. It's hitscan since it's supposed to be super fast right? So why the drop-off? 
                BECAUSE it's hitscan, if it was hitscan and had no damage dropoff it would be Very overpowered, or it would have to have its base damage nerfed to where it wouldn't be fun to use at all, because a good player can hit a hitscan sniper shot most times, you'd be getting pinged by the havoc at distances you can't do anything about.
                Lazers are less focused over a longer distance I suppose
                agreed it seems stupid. hitscan weapons shouldnt have damage dropoff, thats the whole point of hitscan, its an instant damage where the reticle is
        55 body.
    Yea with select-fire it feels like a strictly worse version of a longbow
Edit: I believe at short range no armor it does 55 damage to the body like the longbow
        I don't think that's the point. It's not supposed to be better than anything else, it's supposed to be more versatile.
            I agree, in theory it gives you more options and is obviously better than running a havoc with no hop up. I just think it’s a little underpowered potentially. I don’t think it makes sense that the slow charging laser beam has so much damage drop off. As others have stated in this thread, if you are fighting at long distance where the hitscan is beneficial it does g7 scout level damage but much slower. I just feel that in most situations it is outclassed by most other guns unless you have turbo for it. Not saying this is inherently a bad thing as some guns should be weaker than others. And the havoc is pretty damn strong with turbo in my opinion.
    It's the only gun with a drop in damage for long distance
    At range it only does 30 per body shot (same as scout), but is significantly easier to hit people with. Seriously I can't hit shit with the scout at high range but I probably hit ~80% of the shots with the havoc. 

If you are able to get a close range shot in with the select fire, I think it can do damage similar to the longbow, but I think you're better off using the turbo charger at close range. 
It makes it hitscan but I don't think the damage is worth it.
Wait, what?!? The energy rounds don’t drop? That’s actually fucking awesome
    No, energy rounds drop.

Every gun in the game is a projectile EXCEPT Havoc with Selectfire, which turns it into a hit scan, which means the shot instantly hits where you're aiming. A game can still have projectile bullets without having bullet drop as a mechanic.
        Are you sure about this? The triple take still has travel time that you have to account for, but I've never had to use the mil dots to adjust for bullet drop. 
            It does because it still has a rangefinder along with the drop measurements. The triple take just has the lowest bullet drop in the game, you don't have to adjust very much even at 200m. Notice the notches in the reticle are all extremely close together.
            Triple take absolutely drop, you probably never used it in long enough distance.
It's hitscan, sure.

But it's also got that awful 1-2s windup before a shot goes off, which is arguably worse than dealing with drop/distance in terms of aiming.
Feels like energy ammo is more common now.
    It is. They said specifically they upped the amount of energy ammo.
Yeah usually only do it for light and heavy. 
Ah yes, the close range automatic shotgun that shoots light ammo, and the midrange fully automatic sniper rifle that shoots light ammo, a great combo
    A game winning combo
    I prefer semi auto sniper mode R301 
PREACH
I can't get the hang of these two guns properly. They are inherently, the easiest seeming and every person who has played a video game has used a gun like this, but I just can't keep it steady enough. 

I've been finding single shot guns working well for me. Triple Take and Scout have been my go to lately. 
    Do you like the peacemaker too?
        I've think I like the Eva-8 better. I don't know why but I seem to be able to control the weapons better when I can just single click, but can still control how fast I click. The peacemaker I usually panic and dont time the click properly.
            Yeah I know what you mean. I prefer the peacemaker, but every time I use it I have to mentally tell myself to relax and not panic-fire or else I’ll be toast...
                Ok I read this chain here and I can't take it anymore. It's the peacekeeper 
Eva 8 is only better than a peacekeeper if you hit every shot and fast. Say you hit 3/5 with pk or eva8 you gonna win with the pk.
    With a Peacekeeper I find I'm more focused on hitting individual shots VS with Eva 8 I just go buck wild spray-n-pray

My skill has gone way up after figuring out - not what the best guns are, but what seems to work best for me.

Spitfire/R99 ftw
    Yeah but the Eva has a faster fire rate, so you can get off 3 shots before the PK gets 2. Assuming both players have the same level of aim, the fight comes down to who gets the first shot off and whether or not the PK has cover to duck behind.
    I would have said the opposite.

Peacekeeper is only better if you hit every shot because you have to wait so long before you can shoot again.

Miss with the Eva8? Who cares? You can shoot again so quickly. 
Smaller stacks mostly, although devotion can really eat through ammo if you aren't accurate enough to kill quickly so that's totally a factor
Dude. I didn't even mention the Mozambique since I thought it was obvious to everyone here that it's everyone's favourite gun. Come on by for my MozamBBQ this weekend!
