[[This guy deserves nothing but respect. A one armed veteran going by the name of ‚ÄúToeYouUp‚Äú on Twitch getting his first Apex win. Incredible.]]





Fuck man, what a boss. Massive respect.
    And his teammate asked if the player they just beat was ‚Äúdisabled.‚Äù I think that‚Äôs irony at its finest.
        Hey there. I am the teammate UNCC\_\_49er or [N](https://Twitch.tv/NickTheGrizzly)ickTheGrizzly on Twitch.

And here's an easy link to his channel [Twitch.tv/ToeYouUp](https://Twitch.tv/ToeYouUp)

I'm really good friends with @ToeYouUp and I said "Disabled" and I definitely meant "Down, but not out". This was before I knew that you could do a Self-Revive with the level 3 knockdown shield.
            No hate for the shameless self promotion but why not a a one click link to his twitch as well?
                You right. Edited. I thought I saw a high up-voted link to his Twitch, might have been another post.

Someone with clout post an easy link to his Twitch. Haha.

"[Twitch.tv/ToeYouUp](https://Twitch.tv/ToeYouUp)'

            I think it's technically level 4
                Oh yes... You are right. It's def level 4 - Gold.
Thanks for catching that. ;)
            Thanks for hitting me up. I didn‚Äôt think there was any malice in the statement, I just found the whole exchange amusing, and a little ironic. Props on the win, brother.
        I think he meant like, 'stunned or unable to attack' as opposed to a pejorative or intentionally ableist language.
            Obviously, hence the use of irony and not assholery.
                i hate both of you
                Irony also applies to his teammate being disabled, so no, not obvious. 
                    Oh wow. Okay.
                        Is there a reason you're argumentative?

The situation would be ironic if they were attempting to insult the last player for their poor aim. IE, they must be disabled because they couldn't kill us.
                He is missing an arm but he doesn‚Äôt seem disabled. Love it
            I can't believe we're using "ableist" unironically now. What have we become...
        I heard that too lol.

I was like, "uhhhhhh Hawkward." 
            Not really, there's weapons in the game that disable your character by fucking up your screen so you can't see.
                [deleted]
                    Honestly I thought he was reacting when he stopped leaning back
                        A legless dude once told us he had a great relationship with his brother because his brother didn't treat his disability as this awkward taboo thing. 

His brother cracks legless jokes, occasionally puts stuff out of reach just to fuck with him. True love?
                            I don't think there's a golden rule for situations like this. They require empathy on the part of both sides - one, to understand the other's current acceptance of what is being discussed; two, to know the limit between a joke and hurting the person.

I think yeah, his brother is showing true love.  Fucking with your siblings is a time-honored tradition.
                            I mean between good friends I doubt that kind of stuff is off limits, if those were his friends I bet one of them made a joke about the enemy playing with one arm. 
                    I think we all get that he meant downed. It's still funny.
                        I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs not cringy and not awkward at all. 

Coincidentally funny? Yeah I‚Äôm not gonna try to claim it isn‚Äôt funny by coincidence. 

It‚Äôs definitely not irony tho. 
                            True. A lot of people do seem to think the guy genuinely reacted to the word disabled. 
            I'm pretty sure they meant if he was one of the downed players. If you get the gold shield you can self revive.
                I got the gold shield once but already after my team disconnected, so no self revive for me.
                    I really thought it would let me revive even with no team. Was disappointed to find that out
            That put the ‚Äòdiss‚Äô in abled. 
        I'm pretty sure he meant disabled not in a physical or mental sense but that an in game ability disabled her character from acting properly. Still not the best phrasing lol
            No, the phrasing was perfectly fine. I get the feeling that man isn't a pussy who wants people to tiptoe around using the word "disabled" just because he's had some shit happen to him
                Im disabled and idc if people say shit like that lol
                    *Your account has temporarily been disabled*

        LMFAO
        Why? This dude is a Vet not a Soy Boy who gets gets offended at every turn.
    Pretty awesome
    You‚Äôve really got to hand it to him. 
    That was an impressive feet. 
he should try the xbox adaptive controller, maybe it will work better for him
    Hey ToeYouUp,

Another Veteran here, I started a Non-Profit a couple years ago, if you want one of these we may be able to help you out, although your skills show you don‚Äôt need it üòÇ. Hit me up!

Edit1: reached out to him via twitter. If he is interested, I‚Äôll organize a way to donate
        If you're hoping to reach this man, I don't believe your comment is going to cut it. Maybe post on his Twitch page.
            Great idea. I‚Äôll check it out today.
                Also looks like he is on PS4, does the adaptive work on any console like that? That would be pretty damn awesome.
                    I believe so, and if not, we can find a solution.
                        We have the technology 
                            This ain‚Äôt 1999!

                                But man, I wish it was. 
                        I believe the adaptive controller is all hardware based, so if you get a converter to use Xbox controllers on PS4 and vice versa, you can set it up to work.
            TOEYOUUP ARE YOU OUT THERE  PLEASE RESPOND
        Since no one has said it yet, thank you for doing this.
        send him a message on twitch as well, more likely he is going to see that

        Post a link to your non-profit. I‚Äôm an active duty gamer and I‚Äôd love to donate to help out. 
        Hey what‚Äôs the name of the non profit? You can pm if it‚Äôs not allowed.
        Huge respect üòä
        Hi! Also another veteran. I only have one hand and I have found many useful products to help.

Check this out https://www.benheck.com/controllers/

I have that. He's also making a PS4 controller.

For PC, I use https://www.3drudder.com and https://www.google.com/amp/s/m.newegg.com/amp/products/0TP-0013-00002
    He is on ps4 though
        Doesn‚Äôt matter. Microsoft made the controller to work on any platform 
            Thats really cool of them but also smart. Sony has nothing like it so anyone who is on ps4 has no choice but to buy microsofts. Did they have to work some sort of deal out with sony?
                Possibly, but I don‚Äôt think so. It‚Äôs technically not an Xbox product. I‚Äôd assume it‚Äôs the same as buying one of the Sony macros to use on Xbox 
                    Ahh i see
                        Yep :)
                    But it has an Xbox button on it?
                        ‚ÄòTechnically‚Äô Sony aren‚Äôt very fond of using other products with theirs.
                            Hey at least headphones work easily on their systems now, unlike the mess that was using a headset with ps3s. My PC Cloud II can easily plug in and out of my ps4 
                                What was the issue with headsets on ps3? For me it worked fine.
                            I think in this case the PR blowback of not allowing it would be severe enough for them to allow it.
                Imagine the internet rage if Xbox said something like "we wanted to let the disabled PS4 players use it too but Sony declined"
                    Yikes. That would be a nightmare for sony. Never thought of it like that
                        Sony isn't allowing it to work out of the box just yet. Sony being Sony =/
                No it‚Äôs a Microsoft controller and not specific to Xbox, works on all platforms the same way usb controllers can work on pc. 
                it's not technically an xbox product. It's more like using a sony headset that can work with any platform
                Not to mention it'd look like a real dick move to block it, not that Japanese companies give a shit about what westerners think
            Does it actually work on any platform now? I know they were planning on adding support but didn't think it was already done
                I‚Äôm about 80% sure it is. Their main focus was to make it accessible to anyone regardless of what they play on so I‚Äôm assuming it was a priority. If not then it‚Äôs just Sony being selfish 
                    Unfortunately at the moment it is not officially compatible with the PS4. Microsoft does want it compatible with every platform and it is a really cool product :)

There are work arounds though!

https://youtu.be/p3p1RTpW4SI
                        Just when you think Sony's greed finally reached its limit. They force you to use work arounds for adaptive controllers. They have no souls.
                            Are you sure Sony is at fault here? 
                                Sony's track record doesn't really merit the benefit of the doubt.
                                    I‚Äôm not familiar with their track record. What have they done?
                                no they don't, but we have to be angry at someone damn it!
                    Their track record isn't the best but it's kinda hard to refuse something like this. Would have been a huge media backfire that would have force them to do it anyway.
                        That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs going to happen. Doesn‚Äôt matter if Sony refuse to allow Microsoft products on their services, this is about allowing anyone to game no matter who they are. 
            No they didn't. You have to buy an unofficial adapter to make it work on ps4. 
            No they didn‚Äôt - you have to use 3rd party dongles if you want to use it on a PS4 (don‚Äôt know about other systems) Those do however seem to work fine with the dongles, but there is no native support for anything other than Xbox hardware currently 
            Uhh.. [really?](https://i.imgur.com/xgm3slg.jpg)
        He could get a xim apex and use an Xbox controller
            It works on all platforms by default.
                Did not know that, that‚Äôs pretty cool. 
                Can't do analogue input on PS4 though, because it detects it as a generic directinput controller
                That's very cool of ms to do  I thought it was just Xbox and was like that's awesome sucks for everyone else though 
            Ive never seen the adaptive controller used. Is it just plug the switches into the board and play or do you have to do some stuff on the xbox its self to program it?
                https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/17/17363964/microsoft-xbox-adaptive-controller-announced-price-release-date

He‚Äôd be able to for example put all buttons in his hand along with movement stick and ADS button and maybe leave the aim stick and trigger to his feet along with maybe the ping button and he can sit comfortably.
                    That would be really cool. That has got to be super uncomfortable. 
                        How uncomfortable do you think it would be? https://youtu.be/_YISTzpLXCY 
                            I still tear up a little when i hear the father say "he's not different when he plays"
                            I was talking about how my leg falls asleep when i sit like that for like 10 minutes
        [deleted]
            Is there a way to give it back? I dont know much about the medals.
                [deleted]
    or this : [https://www.benheck.com/ps4-single-handed-prototype-complete/](https://www.benheck.com/ps4-single-handed-prototype-complete/)
        Looks like he doesn't have a left handed prototype yet.
            He has a video on it and says that he usually uses his right hand to mail the protyping (as he's right handed) but isn't hard for him to flip and adjust for left hands
    I was gonna say the same thing 
    Why doesn‚Äôt he play on pc with a razor mouse that has a shit ton of buttons so he only has to use one hand? 
        because walking with WASD?
            There are mice that have basically an entire numpad on the side, you could easily bind the movement keys there.
        I have used a mouse with 12 buttons on it and I can tell you that it‚Äôs really hard (Almost impossible) to press two separate buttons at once unless they are touching.  In fps games you need to be able to do multiple things at once. Like slide and reload or strafe and cast ultimate. Etc a controller makes more sense when you take into account multiple simultaneous actions. 
    Can it do gyroscopic aiming? I had one arm unusable for 8 weeks but honestly playing with one hand wasn't bad at all once I got used to it. I actually still play with the gyroscope now.
    But, he just made champion with the set up he has. I'd say it's working for him just fine. 
    Ben Hecks also made a one handed controller for PS4. Uses dualshock 4 internals and is kinda like a flight stick sort of deal except it has a joy stick on the bottom that you rest on your knee and use for movement. Super neat design.
    His aim is better than mine already. 
    There is actually a guy on YouTube who designed a one handed PS4 controller that functions really well. But it looks like this guy has the whole foot thing down maybe he doesn't wanna change it up. 
    Ben Heck just made a one handed PS4 controller
And he's missing his whole pelvic region :0
    I just noticed that lol
        [deleted]
            Plot twist: he painted his arm green. 
                I'm so dissappointed in myself for laughing at this... Much respect to this guy but I can't help it
                    I‚Äôm sure if he‚Äôs on twitch he has a decent humor about it
                        Oh I'm sure he does, just doesn't mean I'm not a terrible human being haha
                            You're not a terrible human. Shit's funny. I've never met an amputee that didn't already have a million jokes of their own about their disability. I'm a below knee amputee and my first name just happens to rhyme with "peg leg". Guess how I introduce myself to people. 
                    He'd probably laugh with you. That's part of how people deal with trouble - if you let your ailments define you, it just holds you down.  You've got to take the hand you're dealt and move forward. 

ToeYouUp, if you see this - thank you for your service. I hope to see you in Apex, mate. 
                        hehe "hand youre dealt"
                            I uh... Whoops. 
                That reminds me of that one streamer that was in a wheelchair and then just stood up on accident.
                    That's the thing everyone can get up out of a wheelchair,  it just needs to be on accident.
            It takes more than skill. It takes bal...it takes a lack of balls.
    wireless legs! the future is now!
    Rayman irl
    goddammit. made me look lol
    Camo clothes are getting impressive.
    Just like Engineer.
    Thought it was an assholey comment till I realized what you meant lol
    I watched the video again but don‚Äôt understand, what does this mean?
        His shorts were green so you couldnt seen them bc he was utilising a green screen
            Oh lmao, didn‚Äôt realize it was a joke. I get it now ;)
        As opposed to?
Wow puts me to shame lol 
    Imagine how good he‚Äôd be if he played on Xbox with the adaptive controller!
        Or PC, since it's also compatible
            Or PS4, since it's also compatible
                or my axe 
                    [deleted]
                        Or Patrick 
                        More like combat able amirite??
                It's detected as a generic controller though, so no analogue input
            Pretty sure it's also compatible with PS4

                With some workarounds ya. Sony hasn't officially allowed their stuff to connect with it out the box. 
            Well, then there would be players who can aim that he'd have to race.
                Get him a mouse with a shit load of buttons, they exist
    I don't even know why I'm so bad at this game.
    Man I've tried to play that game but for the life of me I can't see the enemies like... I know where they are shooting from, but Wtf I can't see them, I'll stick to OW
        Turn on your monitor?
        I had that problem initially, you get used to it.
        Yeah, this is my one complaint so far, the enemies blend a lot with the environment and it's pretty hard to distinguish enemies and friends.
            Really? For me enemies stand out way too much regardless of environment xD. But then again I come from Battlefield 5 where visibility is a bitch so I must be used to that...
                I could never see enemies in any Battlefield game, so yeah your eyes must be used to that. 
                Literally the one good thing about BFV's visibility

Other games: visibility is bad

BFV gang: *laughs in superhuman sight*
            1) turn off volumetric lighting, that can help make enemies easier to spot against glare

2) Have you checked out the accessibility options in Apex? There's a color blind mode that might make it easier for you to spot enemies by changing how they are displayed
            The enemies sorta glow? What are you guys talking about lol. So easy to see people
                Wot? I haven't noticed that at all. Did it come out in an update in the last 24 hours?
                    No. 
                        As far as I'm aware, enemies only glow once you've pegged their shields once.  Otherwise, they don't glow at all.  I've had a really difficult time distinguishing enemies when I first started playing, but once you start looking for movement instead it become easier.
            That's strange I have a a red green brown color issue where I have an issue with most games and spotting people. Pubg was horrible for me. 


        I‚Äôm the same way man, I feel literally blind playing this game.  I‚Äôll die alll the time and not see my enemies.  
        Saaame. I can't hit shit cuz I cant see during a firefight. I played it for like a day then went back to Overwatch and immediately had a seven game win streak cuz it's so much easier to see people in Overwatch üòÇ
    I remember there is a smash pro, or possibly a street fighter pro that literally plays with his mouth. It is crazy how adaptable people are
    Dudes fucking Jacked. 
    I've only gotten three kills in 4 rounds, I uninstalled and won't be reinstalling.
        No don't I only got two kills in last three rounds but practice makes purpose think of this guy he didn't give up even with one arm. 
‚ÄúWas she disabled bro‚Äù
    In this case I think he means literally disabled, like she was stunned or downed.
        Probably, but in my experience (having an uncle who lost a leg in the service) even if it was a joke at his expense, he probably doesn't take offense. Heck, my Uncle makes jokes about his leg almost everytime I see him.
            I've never heard more jokes about missing limbs from my friend who had a missing leg. Turn a weakness into a strength. I think the only thing I ever heard he was bothered by was people specifically holding doors for him because he was missing a leg because he said at 75% he was stronger than they were at 100
                That's actually pretty interesting. 

People think that some people can just brush off anything. when something as simple as holding the door open actually bothers them. 

Context is pretty important. And having a loved one joke about something is very different to someone else pointing it out.
                    Thats something alot of people do too. Shit Ive had to stop myself from holding open doors for people at university since its not the same vibe as my hometown. 
                        I just hold the door for everybody. If that offends anyone (and it has) that's their personal issue not mine. Sorry for being courteous.
                I mean holding a door open isn't exactly a feat of strength. It's just polite to hold the door even to non disabled people.
                Missing a leg and just wanna add some input into this:

We laugh about it because honestly, you have to. That sounds much, much sadder than it is, but it's simply that your choices are to move on or piss and moan about and let it define you. You meet so many disabled people laughing it off *because* it's like wtf do you want them to do, be a pussy-ass little bitch about the topic their entire lives? What a miserable existence that'd be. *Of course* we laugh it off; you would too, unless you prefer writing poems about the darkness consuming your tortured soul.

On the topic of door-holding and the like, I never got that one or why it upsets some disabled people....until recently. Recent years my prosthetic has become something I can't wear. I have some kind of pain that kicks in after 2-3 hours of wearing it. It's not specific to any one prosthetic and clearly lies within my body. We suspect nerve pains but unfortunately that's hard to prove and to treat in my case. Anyways, I've been on crutches instead. I'm perfectly fine with this and in some ways feel faster/more nimble on crutches since that's a lot of weight no longer hanging onto my leg. (or what I have of one)

This is the thing: I feel more disabled socially and financially than anything else. Tell me to do something, I'll do it. Pretty much the only time I'll say "I can't" is if you ask me to beat someone in a running race, in which case I'll say "wtf asshole," but I'd simultaneously point out honestly, how important is it to be able to run fast in your day-to-day life? (and keyword *run.* I can move fast too, but it's rare you actually have to run somewhere) Anything that you need to do daily...? Man I live alone. I emigrated to another country on my own. I clearly don't have to worry about dependency on anyone or not being able to do something, so as a practical limitation...? It isn't. Depending on the situation, it can be an advantage (countries that offer workplace benefits for X % of disabled workers) or disadvantage. (USA gonna fuck your ass cause how dare you have a disability, gimme your money)

Financial is something that affects me if I'm in the USA, but luckily I'm a dual citizen and can dodge that bullet, yay. 

Socially...? It has become blatantly obvious to me that I am perceived as weaker now that I use crutches instead of my prosthetic. A part of it *can* be pretty miserable, because it's this feeling that no matter what you do, you will not be recognized for it. This is annoying because it eats at you and makes you question if those opportunities that passed you by (new love interest, new job opportunity, whatever) actually passed you by because you underachieved or because someone *perceived* you wouldn't be good enough. It's simply the frustration with not knowing, but also being able to compare something like prosthetic vs. crutches and seeing a clear difference. Constantly using it as an excuse for failures is toxic and a no-go, so the only option is to get even better, but that doesn't make it any less bitter when something doesn't feel deserved.

Speaking for my surroundings for example, I know I walk more than 90% of my collegues and also seem to be stronger (I mean wtf my hands are now my feet too, effectively) than most, but if I and someone I know were to both slip on a wet floor in a supermarket, he might get stared at or laughed at while I'm gonna get this huge pity party coming to make sure I don't need to go to the hospital. Hate it. It's not that I don't appreciate the concern, but rather what gets unintentionally conveyed during those moments is "I don't view you as an equal and I view you as less capable. (even though I just watched you carrying four shopping bags through the store on crutches)"

So yeah, at the end of the day I don't think it's much to do with needing to prove strength or anything, but rather just an ongoing lament that even if **you** personally can overcome your disability, loads of people will never, ever ever recognize this and they will view you as less for it by default. 

My advice for people not wanting to accidently do this? If you encounter a disabled guy going to a door or whatever, just judge if it looks like he wants/expects/is waiting on the help or not. They're not gonna be afraid to tell you they want the help if they do. If they're pausing at the door or something or they seem to slow down as their body language turns towards others, sure. If you JUST watched that guy open two doors after another with no problem, he's turning to leave after buying his stuff, and now you're like "OH HERE LET ME GET OUT FROM BEHIND THIS COUNTER TO HELP YOU, PLEASE WAIT SIR" then it's like 'tf are you blind? 
                A buddy of mine got his legs blown off in Afghanistan and he wears shirts that say all kinda crazy shit. He wore one to the reunion that says ‚ÄúHave you seen my legs?‚Äù He‚Äôs got one with like a frantic looking face on it that says ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt find my legs.‚Äù My favorite one though, it says ‚ÄúSpring Break 2010‚Äù (he got blown up April 2010) in like real vibrant rainbow wavy colors and there‚Äôs an all white picture of an amputee holding his legs up behind it. He‚Äôs awesome. 
                My husband is missing part of a finger and we make stump jokes about it all the time. We wouldn't go up to a rando amputee and start clowning them though.
                i get him being annoyed by it but at the same time its really hard to know whats the right thing to do, either im the asshole who wont hold a door for a disabled person or im the asshole who thinks he cant do it himself
                    This is true. The gesture is generally good, but since he could do it well, he liked to. It's a weird slope
                Tell your friend that ppl often hold doors just to be polite and it has nothing to do with his disability.
                Same thing happened for my good friend a little while after his dad passed, he started making dead dad jokes, he loved his dad but it was just for shock value and to fuck with people after a while I got used to it but at first I was like fuckkkk that's dark man and didn't really know what to say.
            In my experience, the majority of people who get offended by certain terms or phrases are people who aren't even affiliated with those terms or phrases.
        The yellow (tier 4) downed shield, brings you back to life..Not sure after how long.
            TIL.

that must be why the game doesn't auto end when you've got 3 ppl knocked down.
                Only on yellow knockdown shield though.
    Prob had lvl 4 shield, it have the skill to revive urself.
        That‚Äôs such an incredible item
            It takes a really long time to use though
    Pretty sure he was talking about Mirage‚Äôs passive ability
         wiggling around?
    He clearly didn't mean it like you think. Listen to the full thing.
    I thought he said "aren't you disabled bro?"

Like he was amazed by that play


        no
    I hate the word cringe but that was exactly it. It was also kinda funny because of the circumstances. 
        [deleted]
            Because reddit is filled with a LOT of socially awkward people who see cringe everywhere because it is usually them.
            The disabled guy didn't get offended so someone has to get offended for him. 
        I once asked a friend I hadn't seen for some time how come his father gave him his car and what car his father is driving now. Turns out his father has passed a couple of weeks before. I felt awkward after that lol. 
            Not really cringe. Not like you knew. 
        Disabled has multiple meanings. He used one of them. I don't see how that is cringe. You are the one who interprets it as handicapped. Given the context, he was more likely to mean something like:
> to make something or someone unable to act in the correct or usual way
        Downed but not killed is what they were probably asking
    I thought the dude said "She must have had one arm" afterwards
    [deleted]
        I actually cringed when I read this.
I don‚Äôt think I would ever be able to control both joysticks with one hand. That‚Äôs like patting your head and rubbing your belly to the extreme.
    What if you had no choice?   Your brain has to rewire itself and often its a pain in the ass.
        Exactly. He has no choice to adapt and learned to do everything with one hand. 
            Improvise. Adapt. Overcome.

Except unironically.
                ‚ÄúGamers‚Äù
                This but unironically 
        I had my one hand disabled for almost a year because of a surgery. I was amazed at how fast my left hand evolved into something useful. The only problem was writing, I got the letters looking nice and all, but if I didn't pay attention it would try to write in the direction of my right hand. So I accidentally wrote stuff you would need a mirror to read.
    That's something I've been practicing for years. Useful for when you want to take a drink, bite, scratch an itch or whatever. Lose a bit of accuracy but it's better than being totally defenceless 
How would you feel knowing you got downed by a foot? Dude props to this guy! Keep on keeping on.
    I suck horribly at FPS games. I'm pretty sure a dog chewing on a controller could beat me.
        We've been matched many times on this. 
I know people that can't do that with two fully functioning hands
    I am people that can't do that with two fully functioning hands
        Yep, right her as well.
        What an inspirational post, I‚Äôm gonna go drink at the bar....
    How do you know me
[deleted]
    The last knocked down person he killed had the legendary self revive shield. They were confused as to why the match didnt end when the last enemy got knocked like it usually does.
        This right here. Would've been sweet to end the match with an execution but a win is a win. Props to this dude.
            Oh for sure, he‚Äôs got more than me anyway :D gg
What a legend! 
    But not all legends are heroes... 

I CAN TELL YOU THIS PERSON IS BOTH A LEGEND AND A HERO!!
His enemies got a taste of... De feet

I'll leave
Someone get that man an adaptive controller.
    I think he's on ps4 and they slackin
        It's compatible on all platforms.
And i cant kill no one 
    [deleted]
        [deleted]
            Same, haven't gotten a kill yet, at this point I'm gonna see how high I can get in rank before that happens. I'm rank 7 right now üòÅ
                Hahaha same and it's tragic. I'm at level 9 right now with 0 kills. It's very disheartening but I just keep hoping I'll get better someday.
                    Don't give up, you'll get there! BR can be really rough at first, especially against seasoned players of the genre.
            You realise that's because most console shooters have some degree of auto-aim with controllers right?
                No thats not the reason. Yes I realize many games have that but I am not talking about that.

A controller is not a very good tool to aim. However I had only controllers as a kid and are really used to it. I can aim pretty good with a controler. If I would play against a clone of me who would have a mouse I would most likely win with the mouse. But I am only playing against people who also have controllers and as far as controller aim goes I would consider myself pretty good.

A mouse gives you a way higher skill sceiling than a controller. I am not really good at aiming with a mouse but if you can do this you are way better than any controller user ever could be. Therefore I get way more shit on in computer games. 

That isnt a bad thing at all, I was just pointing out that my mouse aim really isnt good at all - it was pretty okay when I was 13 years old and played counterstrike 1.6 but after that (and a brief source phase) I didnt really played any shooters anymore... now im 28 and I have a real hard time catching up. The game is still super fun tho
        I was used to mouse + keyboard, but month ago i switched to ps4 and i am not good at fps games.
            Imagine you're painting alongside bob ross. You have your paint brush in your hand. You make wide sweeping strokes to begin the painting. Your whole arm is into it. As the painting comes to a close and you begin on finer details you start to use more of your wrist and fine control of your fingers. It is finally finished. Now take out a fresh canvas. You paint the same thing but this time you have two brushes taped to your thumbs instead. You cant touch the brushes with any of your fingers and cant move the rest of your arm. This is what it's like to play keyboard and mouse vs controller for those with experience. But its okay because everyone on console is limited in the same way too. Cant wait for crossplay when I can start wrecking people's thumb-only paintings.
                [deleted]
    I was happy when I got my first 3 kills in a game, then I saw a champion in the next game who had 452 kills...like, what?
    >And i cant kill no one

So you can kill someone?
Holy SHIT that is dope
So inspiring to see a man who lost an arm, waist, and both thighs in service to to his country succeed despite it all.
    he lost it in a motrocycle accident.
        [pic taken moments before the crash](https://thumbs.worthpoint.com/zoom/images2/1/0717/09/army-ww2-african-american-military_1_d9d6a64d9a30dea8844069c2bcd7cc36.jpg)
    Theres another guy that was like this but worst. No arms and Global Elite in CSGO. He was a streamer but I forgot his name.
Much respect dude, that was a great shot as well! 
Ben Heck Hacks. A youtuber who makes Custom Single Handed controllers for Ps4. Here is a video of his recent creation.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTGtbLhldPc
    I was seeing if anybody else had brought this up! I think this would be great if Ben could send this guy one! Really test out Ben's design.
I now am wondering how many appendages my teammates are missing to be as shitty as they are.
my fav part: ‚Äúwas she disabled bro?‚Äù says the teammate of a one armed veteran
    People keep commenting this, but he's talking about the enemy being downed ("disabled") but they didn't die, even tho they were the last alive. Normally the game would end, but they must have had a self-revive, which is super rare to find. So, when he shot them again, they fully died. That's why they were confused.
        no he said disabled referring to just like waddling around and not shooting them as they were rezzing
Somebody get this guy an adaptive controller 
    Seems like he doesn‚Äôt need one. I honestly can‚Äôt see how that aim can be improved further; dude lines that shot up faster than I could have.
That username is everything lol
Incoming "I HaVe 2 ArMs AnD sTiLl cAnT wIn"
When someone with one hand aims better then you with 2 
Note to self, don‚Äôt wear green shorts when using green screen! :) great win man!
    Wait a sec. This guy's not "one armed". He's wearing a green sleeve and glove on his right side!
He‚Äôs better than I am for sure. Wish Sony had some of those new controllers like Microsoft has for people with disabilities or major injuries. If he‚Äôs this good now he‚Äôd probably be even better with something optimized for him. 
Why is his former occupation remotely rrelevant outside typical American glorification of the military?
    In this circumstance, I think it‚Äôs provides some context to ‚Äúhow did his lose his arm!?‚Äù
        No because he lost it in a motorcycle accident 
        I think the best response to that is "why does it matter"?
    Show some GOD DAMN RESPECT YOU TERRORIST. /S

When you don't show respect to the military in America. 
Hell ya bro! Airborne!
Why was armour and shield pink? 
    Colorblind mode
        K thanks
            yw
It‚Äôs bad enough that he doesn‚Äôt have an arm, but he‚Äôs missing his pelvis too!

Nice win, better than I‚Äôll ever be
Nothin but respect. What a badass. 
What he deserves is proper care from our government. 
    How do you know he's not getting proper care ? 
        As a veteran as well, if that happened in the service, that man has a fat paycheck from the VA every month for the rest of his life. Obviously that will never make up for the loss of arm, but it's a start. Just agreeing with you here.
            his loss of arm has nothing to do with the military.
                Well then the military is not responsible as they were not the cause of the accident.

Edit: This sounds more close minded than I meant. The government should take care of him and im sure they do somewhat through disability.
        The fact that 10 percent of the us homeless pop are veterans. 90% of which have mental illness, which includes drug abuse.  I think around 40 percent of vets with gov sponsored loans lose their homes. 10k to 50 or 60k a year with two missing legs isn't a fat check by today's cost of living.  Veterans access to healthcare is no way for to effective. Maybe he is getting care, but he is one out of a hundred at best. Point is, as a whole, no veterans are getting taken care of properly.
            [deleted]
            he's obviously getting proper care from the government and is not homeless considering he's streaming games
    He lost his arm in a motorcycle accident.
Damn really beating people with one arm that‚Äôs dope 
I wonder if he gets feet cramps doing this.
And I die two minutes after landing with two fully functional hands. Wow
Wow, my wins feel less significant now.
Great achievement!!!
Lol to all the peeps who don‚Äôt have a win yet what losers!!
(As I walk in the corner crying cause I‚Äôm one of those losers) 
He post his lower torso too, so sad :(
[deleted]
Damn he's using his foot with a controller? I know it's been said before but he should definitely consider getting the Xbox Adaptive Controller, should up his game even more.
He even stopped to  revive his teammate. Always lending a hand I see.
What a G üòé
I wonder how many people he murdered IRL...
Americans and thier veteran worship.
Damn! Amazing but shiiiiiiiiiiit I‚Äôd hate to touch that controller.
Oh fuck he killed me :):
Fuck yea . Right on for him
Mad props to that guy for getting a win im trash and only have 2 wins due to carrys but i have an excuse because i lag everywhere and my graphics are the lowest possible ;'(
"Was she like disabled, bro?" OMEGALUL
Hell yeah! You‚Äôre my boy blue! 
WAY better than Ninja! 
And I suck with two arms :( mad props to this guy!! Holy shit 
PlayStation needs an adaptive controller 
Those new Nike Camo shorts are legit
Get that man an Xbox and an Adaptive Controller!
Honestly disappointed he didn't raise his leg with his handüò£
Here I am still dying seconds after spawning. Serious mad respect to this guy!
If he can win with a normal controller, imagine what he could do with something like the adaptive controller from MicrosoftZ
Amazing
now this

IS TRULY EPIC


Well I have two arms and he is still better than me lmao... Respect! 
Respawn needs to put him in game as a new Legend. Like a one-handed fighter with some gunslinger skills and shit. 
What is Apex?

I had a friend when I was younger that only had one arm. He consistently kicked my ass at video games and shooting pool. 

Nothing weirder than that first time he wanted to play video games, ‚Äúuhh sure?‚Äù I said, as I laugh to myself.  Then he rips his shoe off and proceeds to kick my ass in halo or something.  

That‚Äôs the day I learned a valuable lesson on making assumptions about handicapped people.
Damn he‚Äôs a beast! Literally playing with one hand and a foot, wow, major props to him.
I'm just happy this games doesn't cost an arm and a leg to play!
Hahaha why was he wearing green screen shorts 
He is better than me with 2 hands
This guy is the true Apex Legend. They should create a champion based on this legend.
Holy shit. I had to rewatch this to understand what was happening. Absolute mad lad. HUGE respect to this guy.
This guys a legend. Dousnt use a onehanded controller designed for him. No he uses a normal controler and operates it with his god dam foot!!!
Has one arm does better than me fml!
He is going what you would call "sicko mode"
> She was disabled bro?

Bro I'M DISABLED
This guy needs to get himself a [one handed ps4 controller](https://youtu.be/OTGtbLhldPc)
What a victory... give this man a hand! 
If he had 2 arms our eyes couldn't handle his skill
This man deserves respect, he served for our country now he‚Äôs only got one arm but he can still play video games better then my brotherüòÇ
Wow he *single handedly* wiped out that squad

(But seriously this is impressive)
‚ÄúWas she disabled?‚Äù Worst context possible to say that phrase. 
what a legend. but i have to say i was laughing a lot when i saw that underwear matching his green screen
how is he better than me lol

    Asking americans not to warship the ground soldiers walk on is ambitious. They tend to be waaaay too indoctrinated.
        Warship Jesus, walks on water, dominates sea warfare.
    Well said
    Imagine turning this cool victory into your own agenda. Imagine being that selfish.
        Mentioning that someone deserves "nothing but respect," while people are calling him a hero, thanking him for his service, and conspicuously pointing out his veteran status over and over is already an agenda. No need to turn it into anything, I'm just making a point.
        Yeah mate no agenda to be found in this post lmao
    u/SaxPanther makes a semi-decent point. A one armed gamer doesn't 'deserve respect' - there are many things out there in this world that do, but just this footage alone isn't respectworthy. Amazing skills though.
    Overreacting little bit there buddy.. Respect for the guy on how he handles playing this game with his physical disability. 
        Agreed but why is their former occupation relevant?  If he was a disabled former McDonalds cook, would it be less impressive?
    First of all, nobody called him a hero you fucking parrot, and second, he clearly is one going for the res in the open like that.

    Reddit likes to circlejerk anything related to veterans even though people like ToeYouUp literally contribute to ruining the lives of millions. It doesn't matter what you do when you sign up, because your skills can be appropriated towards a cause that hurts individuals. The military machine of western forces like the US military steals other countries' natural resources or tries to establish regional control through destabilizing other governments.
    Do me a favor and take a big step back and literally fuck your own face.
        *If only someone had said that to all the marines so they wouldn't do it to civilians overseas*.
> This guy deserves nothing but respect.

Why, because he lost his arm in probably a worthless war causing tons of civillians to die?

I wouldn't say so.
    Motorcycle accident*
    Hey screw you man. Seriously get out of here. You took this wholesome post and made it political. You‚Äôre what‚Äôs wrong with the world, you‚Äôre so focused on politics that you have to push your ideals on everything. You crusade your beliefs so hard that you ruin enjoyable moments. Check your politics at the door, games are meant to be fun 
        US soldiers don't deserve any respect and title says otherwise.
            None of them do? Man you're cynical. 
            Why? 
                [deleted]
        Then his former occupation shouldn't have been included in the title.
    The respect here isn't because he lost his limbs. It doesn't matter how he lost them. The respect here is for the sheer willpower and determination to work through all that shit and still come out on top.
This is a victory of sheer willpower. Thanks for your service. We should celebrate our veterans more
    They're celebrated far too much as it is.
        This is the stupidest thing I have heard for a very long time
            Sorry to hurt your feelings, but mainstream American society already treats veterans like flawless heroes.  This isn't debatable,  it's simple recognition of reality.

And considering America hasn't had a justified conflict in decades, its frankly ridiculous. 
What if this dude were a one armed gas pump attendant? Do you think this post would have as much praise? He lost his arm in a motorcycle accident and could have shot a baby in the face for funsies while overseas...Why do we worship soldiers in America so fucking much? I know plenty of asshole veterans...almost all of them in fact. 
Props on the win and thank you for your service.
His pants disappear lol
I hope Apex Legends stays strong and popular so that we all can get a sequel to Titanfall 2.
He's playing a game.  Relax.  
Being a veteran has nothing to do with it except that he's also a killer in the real world and for some reason you're proud of that
[deleted]
Mad respect. Thanks for your service Toeyouup and now you've got another follower on Twitch
So how was he supposed to earn my respect?
    He fought for your country and just won a battleroyale game with 1 arm .. 
        Great on him, people wake up everyday and do the exact same thing, not even having to fight for my country. 
He could be an asshole in real life/etc.

You ain‚Äôt earning my respect just cause we assume you are a great person getting beyond a handicap.

What a legend
Pure epicness. 
He plays the game better than me, well played 
Holy shit props. What a true legend.

No more excuses boys.
Dude! High FIV...I mean, great game!
Fuck he is better than me
He's better than me and I have 2 arms
Imagine losing both your arm and your crotch.
And i cant even get a win with 2 hands.....smh
This is really heart warming. 
That is awesome. Good for him! 
I don‚Äôt know if should feel better that a one armed veteran got a win before me, or bad that a one armed veteran got a win before me. Either way, amazing stuff!!
Yellow knockdown shield has an autorez mechanic. They have to confirm you or you can bring yourself back up even if you are the last
For a minute I was confused as to how he had legs, but then I realized he‚Äôs using a green screen while in green pants. 
Are we not gonna talk about his magical shorts üòÇ mad respect though and thank you for your service sir. 
What a dude! I think MS offer an accessibility controller now. Would be perfect for this guy!. 
You could say, this game cost an arm and a leg to win
This dude has better aim than me with 1 arm, incredible
I‚Äôd uninstall if I lost against Megan foxes twin ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Puts bots to shame!
For anyone interested in a one handed PS4 controller this guy made one and I believe he sells them: https://youtu.be/Jx8pkh6JF8A
Upvote given and mad respect to the hero, but aren't there rules about advertising channels? I'd hate to see this sub turn into a "post clips and subscribe" hotbed.
His fucking shorts. üòÇüòÇüòÇ 
instant follow for me. much respect. 
I had a friend growing uo who had very little movement available to him because of a disease he contracted as a baby. His feet however had better dexterity than his hands so he used them to play video games. Dude used to wreck me at Fifa and Madden. This reminded me of him. 

Congrats to this dude
Respects i dont even have a win yet
Best off playing on xbox and using the adapter they made for disabled players
if you cover up the guy, you can't even tell this is being played with a fucking hand and foot. fucking incredible
Was she disabled

That wasn‚Äôt good
WOW
I‚Äôd lose to him easily. What a player. 
I wonder if it‚Äôd be possible to port the Xbox adaptive controller to a PS4... he‚Äôd by wayyy better 
This dud is fucking amazing!
‚ÄúFuck she was like disabled, bro?‚Äù
This dude it the real Champion 
Respectüò±
I'm loving this game man, everything seems so smooth and responsive. It's difficult but if you keep your cool winning can be done. 
Awesome
This man is a god, insanely impressive 
That‚Äôs fucking crazy. Mad props
That‚Äôs fucking awesome
üôè
I never considered giving any donations to someone on twitch, but seing this makes me want to support thay guy. He is incredible! Thanks for making me discover that guy
Awesome man!  Respect!!
That‚Äôs awesome! Yeah I wish he was on Xbox so he could try the adaptive controller out, see if it works well for him!
Better aim than me‚òπÔ∏è
Not only missing an arm but also a torso too! Impressive! 
This guy is amazing! Props my dude!
Awesome!!
I can't win one match and I have two arms smh.   Props to him! 
Yooo! I had a friend on steam who played csgo with one hand, I can find his twitch soon.
I couldn't hope to be that good with three arms...

Good for this guy, man.
what a güôåüèª
What an absolute fucking beast
So I just won a game where I got 15 kills (14, technically)... And I come on Reddit to instantly have my ego deflated. Well done.
They should do an one-armed legend  as a form of paying homage to this real life legend
i thought twitch had rules about showing feet?
If he had an Xbox he couldve used the adaptive controller
That's actually incredible
He's the apex legend
Oh i know this guy, hes a huge battlefield fan, he used to play alot of Battlefield 1 if i remember correctly.
Holy shit that‚Äôs amazing
Makes me feel inferior about my handful of wins...I definitely don‚Äôt have a footful.
what a god!
I wish this video was 3 seconds longer because at the end he was saying "he must have had one less arm than me" i love people like this guy that can have a sense of humor even after going through everything he has gone through. mad respect for this vet!
I can't even win with two arms, respect
‚ÄúShe was like, disabled bro...‚Äù 
He is better than me. 
Wow. The dexterity needed to pull this off is on some Jedi level. 
Some people really are amazing!
Poor guy lost his waist area too :(
Hook him up with one of Ben Heck's creation.
This is actually awesome.
Imagine dying to him LOL I‚Äôd uninstall
You can see through his shorts ??? WTF
    Green screen plus he‚Äôs wearing green shorts.
        Oh thanku man.
Got damn! I would've had so many foot muscle spasms doing that lol. That takes a lot of practice. Lol
Can we fuck off with this apex shit. The shilling has become crazy as of late. As for this guy playing video games cool man keep on keeping on.
If you like him check out Rocky no hands dude plays with this crazy mouth controller. Kinda amazes how resourceful some people are.

He's jacked, good looking, fought for our country, better at gaming than me. I love seeing people who make the best of things. I love gaming, but I'd just quit due to frustration if I only had one appendage. Looks like it doesn't hold him back.
I bet he‚Äôd be even better if he had a pelvis.
I don't like this post. It makes me feel bad about how much I suck in this game. Even a dude with 1 arm is much better than I am
1 kill? LMAO
How the he‚Äôll does he even aim?
It‚Äôs insane. The players are moving so fast sometimes. 
Fuck yeaaaaahh! 
Getting tired of everybody screaming "LETS GO" whenever they win.
Okay now i feel bad about my self that i suck at the game üòÇ
He needs to see this. I want to stream him. I almost teared up watching this. Fucking onion cutting ninjas man. 
THIS IS CONTENT
I hope he becomes the "Ninja" of Apex if for no other reason then to provide hope and encouragement for gamers with physical challenges. 
Now he needs to play caustic to feel trully disabled
Phenominal 
Now *that* is an actual Apex Legend
Give him a hand
And his teammate asked if the player they just beat was ‚Äúdisabled.‚Äù I think that‚Äôs irony at its finest.
    Hey there. I am the teammate UNCC\_\_49er or [N](https://Twitch.tv/NickTheGrizzly)ickTheGrizzly on Twitch.

And here's an easy link to his channel [Twitch.tv/ToeYouUp](https://Twitch.tv/ToeYouUp)

I'm really good friends with @ToeYouUp and I said "Disabled" and I definitely meant "Down, but not out". This was before I knew that you could do a Self-Revive with the level 3 knockdown shield.
        No hate for the shameless self promotion but why not a a one click link to his twitch as well?
            You right. Edited. I thought I saw a high up-voted link to his Twitch, might have been another post.

Someone with clout post an easy link to his Twitch. Haha.

"[Twitch.tv/ToeYouUp](https://Twitch.tv/ToeYouUp)'

;)

&#x200B;
        I think it's technically level 4
            Oh yes... You are right. It's def level 4 - Gold.
Thanks for catching that. ;)
        Thanks for hitting me up. I didn‚Äôt think there was any malice in the statement, I just found the whole exchange amusing, and a little ironic. Props on the win, brother.
    I think he meant like, 'stunned or unable to attack' as opposed to a pejorative or intentionally ableist language.
        Obviously, hence the use of irony and not assholery.
            i hate both of you
            Irony also applies to his teammate being disabled, so no, not obvious. 
                Oh wow. Okay.
                    Is there a reason you're argumentative?

The situation would be ironic if they were attempting to insult the last player for their poor aim. IE, they must be disabled because they couldn't kill us.
            He is missing an arm but he doesn‚Äôt seem disabled. Love it
        I can't believe we're using "ableist" unironically now. What have we become...
    I heard that too lol.

I was like, "uhhhhhh Hawkward." 
        Not really, there's weapons in the game that disable your character by fucking up your screen so you can't see.
            [deleted]
                Honestly I thought he was reacting when he stopped leaning back
                    A legless dude once told us he had a great relationship with his brother because his brother didn't treat his disability as this awkward taboo thing. 

His brother cracks legless jokes, occasionally puts stuff out of reach just to fuck with him. True love?
                        I don't think there's a golden rule for situations like this. They require empathy on the part of both sides - one, to understand the other's current acceptance of what is being discussed; two, to know the limit between a joke and hurting the person.

I think yeah, his brother is showing true love.  Fucking with your siblings is a time-honored tradition.
                        I mean between good friends I doubt that kind of stuff is off limits, if those were his friends I bet one of them made a joke about the enemy playing with one arm. 
                I think we all get that he meant downed. It's still funny.
                    I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs not cringy and not awkward at all. 

Coincidentally funny? Yeah I‚Äôm not gonna try to claim it isn‚Äôt funny by coincidence. 

It‚Äôs definitely not irony tho. 
                        True. A lot of people do seem to think the guy genuinely reacted to the word disabled. 
        I'm pretty sure they meant if he was one of the downed players. If you get the gold shield you can self revive.
            I got the gold shield once but already after my team disconnected, so no self revive for me.
                I really thought it would let me revive even with no team. Was disappointed to find that out
        That put the ‚Äòdiss‚Äô in abled. 
    I'm pretty sure he meant disabled not in a physical or mental sense but that an in game ability disabled her character from acting properly. Still not the best phrasing lol
        No, the phrasing was perfectly fine. I get the feeling that man isn't a pussy who wants people to tiptoe around using the word "disabled" just because he's had some shit happen to him
            Im disabled and idc if people say shit like that lol

    Why? This dude is a Vet not a Soy Boy who gets gets offended at every turn.
Pretty awesome
You‚Äôve really got to hand it to him. 
That was an impressive feet. 
Hey ToeYouUp,

Another Veteran here, I started a Non-Profit a couple years ago, if you want one of these we may be able to help you out, although your skills show you don‚Äôt need it üòÇ. Hit me up!

Edit1: reached out to him via twitter. If he is interested, I‚Äôll organize a way to donate
    If you're hoping to reach this man, I don't believe your comment is going to cut it. Maybe post on his Twitch page.
        Great idea. I‚Äôll check it out today.
            Also looks like he is on PS4, does the adaptive work on any console like that? That would be pretty damn awesome.
                I believe so, and if not, we can find a solution.
                    We have the technology 
                        This ain‚Äôt 1999!
                            https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/a2bxjj/video_how_to_use_the_xbox_adaptive_controller_on/
                            But man, I wish it was. 
                    I believe the adaptive controller is all hardware based, so if you get a converter to use Xbox controllers on PS4 and vice versa, you can set it up to work.
        TOEYOUUP ARE YOU OUT THERE  PLEASE RESPOND
    Since no one has said it yet, thank you for doing this.
    send him a message on twitch as well, more likely he is going to see that

    Post a link to your non-profit. I‚Äôm an active duty gamer and I‚Äôd love to donate to help out. 
    Hey what‚Äôs the name of the non profit? You can pm if it‚Äôs not allowed.
    Huge respect üòä
    Hi! Also another veteran. I only have one hand and I have found many useful products to help.

Check this out https://www.benheck.com/controllers/

I have that. He's also making a PS4 controller.

For PC, I use https://www.3drudder.com and https://www.google.com/amp/s/m.newegg.com/amp/products/0TP-0013-00002
He is on ps4 though
    Doesn‚Äôt matter. Microsoft made the controller to work on any platform 
        Thats really cool of them but also smart. Sony has nothing like it so anyone who is on ps4 has no choice but to buy microsofts. Did they have to work some sort of deal out with sony?
            Possibly, but I don‚Äôt think so. It‚Äôs technically not an Xbox product. I‚Äôd assume it‚Äôs the same as buying one of the Sony macros to use on Xbox 
                Ahh i see
                    Yep :)
                But it has an Xbox button on it?
                    ‚ÄòTechnically‚Äô Sony aren‚Äôt very fond of using other products with theirs.
                        Hey at least headphones work easily on their systems now, unlike the mess that was using a headset with ps3s. My PC Cloud II can easily plug in and out of my ps4 
                            What was the issue with headsets on ps3? For me it worked fine.
                        I think in this case the PR blowback of not allowing it would be severe enough for them to allow it.
            Imagine the internet rage if Xbox said something like "we wanted to let the disabled PS4 players use it too but Sony declined"
                Yikes. That would be a nightmare for sony. Never thought of it like that
                    Sony isn't allowing it to work out of the box just yet. Sony being Sony =/
            No it‚Äôs a Microsoft controller and not specific to Xbox, works on all platforms the same way usb controllers can work on pc. 
            it's not technically an xbox product. It's more like using a sony headset that can work with any platform
            Not to mention it'd look like a real dick move to block it, not that Japanese companies give a shit about what westerners think
        Does it actually work on any platform now? I know they were planning on adding support but didn't think it was already done
            I‚Äôm about 80% sure it is. Their main focus was to make it accessible to anyone regardless of what they play on so I‚Äôm assuming it was a priority. If not then it‚Äôs just Sony being selfish 
                Unfortunately at the moment it is not officially compatible with the PS4. Microsoft does want it compatible with every platform and it is a really cool product :)

There are work arounds though!

https://youtu.be/p3p1RTpW4SI
                    Just when you think Sony's greed finally reached its limit. They force you to use work arounds for adaptive controllers. They have no souls.
                        Are you sure Sony is at fault here? 
                            Sony's track record doesn't really merit the benefit of the doubt.
                                I‚Äôm not familiar with their track record. What have they done?
                            no they don't, but we have to be angry at someone damn it!
                Their track record isn't the best but it's kinda hard to refuse something like this. Would have been a huge media backfire that would have force them to do it anyway.
                    That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs going to happen. Doesn‚Äôt matter if Sony refuse to allow Microsoft products on their services, this is about allowing anyone to game no matter who they are. 
        No they didn't. You have to buy an unofficial adapter to make it work on ps4. 
        No they didn‚Äôt - you have to use 3rd party dongles if you want to use it on a PS4 (don‚Äôt know about other systems) Those do however seem to work fine with the dongles, but there is no native support for anything other than Xbox hardware currently 
        Uhh.. [really?](https://i.imgur.com/xgm3slg.jpg)
    He could get a xim apex and use an Xbox controller
        It works on all platforms by default.
            Did not know that, that‚Äôs pretty cool. 
            Can't do analogue input on PS4 though, because it detects it as a generic directinput controller
            That's very cool of ms to do  I thought it was just Xbox and was like that's awesome sucks for everyone else though 
        Ive never seen the adaptive controller used. Is it just plug the switches into the board and play or do you have to do some stuff on the xbox its self to program it?
            https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/17/17363964/microsoft-xbox-adaptive-controller-announced-price-release-date

He‚Äôd be able to for example put all buttons in his hand along with movement stick and ADS button and maybe leave the aim stick and trigger to his feet along with maybe the ping button and he can sit comfortably.
                That would be really cool. That has got to be super uncomfortable. 
                    How uncomfortable do you think it would be? https://youtu.be/_YISTzpLXCY 
                        I still tear up a little when i hear the father say "he's not different when he plays"
                        I was talking about how my leg falls asleep when i sit like that for like 10 minutes
    [deleted]
        Is there a way to give it back? I dont know much about the medals.
            [deleted]
or this : [https://www.benheck.com/ps4-single-handed-prototype-complete/](https://www.benheck.com/ps4-single-handed-prototype-complete/)
    Looks like he doesn't have a left handed prototype yet.
        He has a video on it and says that he usually uses his right hand to mail the protyping (as he's right handed) but isn't hard for him to flip and adjust for left hands
I was gonna say the same thing 
Why doesn‚Äôt he play on pc with a razor mouse that has a shit ton of buttons so he only has to use one hand? 
    because walking with WASD?
        There are mice that have basically an entire numpad on the side, you could easily bind the movement keys there.
    I have used a mouse with 12 buttons on it and I can tell you that it‚Äôs really hard (Almost impossible) to press two separate buttons at once unless they are touching.  In fps games you need to be able to do multiple things at once. Like slide and reload or strafe and cast ultimate. Etc a controller makes more sense when you take into account multiple simultaneous actions. 
Can it do gyroscopic aiming? I had one arm unusable for 8 weeks but honestly playing with one hand wasn't bad at all once I got used to it. I actually still play with the gyroscope now.
But, he just made champion with the set up he has. I'd say it's working for him just fine. 
Ben Hecks also made a one handed controller for PS4. Uses dualshock 4 internals and is kinda like a flight stick sort of deal except it has a joy stick on the bottom that you rest on your knee and use for movement. Super neat design.
His aim is better than mine already. 
There is actually a guy on YouTube who designed a one handed PS4 controller that functions really well. But it looks like this guy has the whole foot thing down maybe he doesn't wanna change it up. 
Ben Heck just made a one handed PS4 controller
I just noticed that lol
    [deleted]
        Plot twist: he painted his arm green. 
            I'm so dissappointed in myself for laughing at this... Much respect to this guy but I can't help it
                I‚Äôm sure if he‚Äôs on twitch he has a decent humor about it
                    Oh I'm sure he does, just doesn't mean I'm not a terrible human being haha
                        You're not a terrible human. Shit's funny. I've never met an amputee that didn't already have a million jokes of their own about their disability. I'm a below knee amputee and my first name just happens to rhyme with "peg leg". Guess how I introduce myself to people. 
                He'd probably laugh with you. That's part of how people deal with trouble - if you let your ailments define you, it just holds you down.  You've got to take the hand you're dealt and move forward. 

ToeYouUp, if you see this - thank you for your service. I hope to see you in Apex, mate. 
                    hehe "hand youre dealt"
                        I uh... Whoops. 
            That reminds me of that one streamer that was in a wheelchair and then just stood up on accident.
                That's the thing everyone can get up out of a wheelchair,  it just needs to be on accident.
        It takes more than skill. It takes bal...it takes a lack of balls.
wireless legs! the future is now!
Rayman irl
goddammit. made me look lol
Camo clothes are getting impressive.
Just like Engineer.
Thought it was an assholey comment till I realized what you meant lol
I watched the video again but don‚Äôt understand, what does this mean?
    His shorts were green so you couldnt seen them bc he was utilising a green screen
        Oh lmao, didn‚Äôt realize it was a joke. I get it now ;)
    As opposed to?
Imagine how good he‚Äôd be if he played on Xbox with the adaptive controller!
    Or PC, since it's also compatible
        Or PS4, since it's also compatible
            or my axe 
                [deleted]
                    Or Patrick 
                    More like combat able amirite??
            It's detected as a generic controller though, so no analogue input
        Pretty sure it's also compatible with PS4

            With some workarounds ya. Sony hasn't officially allowed their stuff to connect with it out the box. 
        Well, then there would be players who can aim that he'd have to race.
            Get him a mouse with a shit load of buttons, they exist
I don't even know why I'm so bad at this game.
Man I've tried to play that game but for the life of me I can't see the enemies like... I know where they are shooting from, but Wtf I can't see them, I'll stick to OW
    Turn on your monitor?
    I had that problem initially, you get used to it.
    Yeah, this is my one complaint so far, the enemies blend a lot with the environment and it's pretty hard to distinguish enemies and friends.
        Really? For me enemies stand out way too much regardless of environment xD. But then again I come from Battlefield 5 where visibility is a bitch so I must be used to that...
            I could never see enemies in any Battlefield game, so yeah your eyes must be used to that. 
            Literally the one good thing about BFV's visibility

Other games: visibility is bad

BFV gang: *laughs in superhuman sight*
        1) turn off volumetric lighting, that can help make enemies easier to spot against glare

2) Have you checked out the accessibility options in Apex? There's a color blind mode that might make it easier for you to spot enemies by changing how they are displayed
        The enemies sorta glow? What are you guys talking about lol. So easy to see people
            Wot? I haven't noticed that at all. Did it come out in an update in the last 24 hours?
                No. 
                    As far as I'm aware, enemies only glow once you've pegged their shields once.  Otherwise, they don't glow at all.  I've had a really difficult time distinguishing enemies when I first started playing, but once you start looking for movement instead it become easier.
        That's strange I have a a red green brown color issue where I have an issue with most games and spotting people. Pubg was horrible for me. 


    I‚Äôm the same way man, I feel literally blind playing this game.  I‚Äôll die alll the time and not see my enemies.  
    Saaame. I can't hit shit cuz I cant see during a firefight. I played it for like a day then went back to Overwatch and immediately had a seven game win streak cuz it's so much easier to see people in Overwatch üòÇ
I remember there is a smash pro, or possibly a street fighter pro that literally plays with his mouth. It is crazy how adaptable people are
Dudes fucking Jacked. 
I've only gotten three kills in 4 rounds, I uninstalled and won't be reinstalling.
    No don't I only got two kills in last three rounds but practice makes purpose think of this guy he didn't give up even with one arm. 
In this case I think he means literally disabled, like she was stunned or downed.
    Probably, but in my experience (having an uncle who lost a leg in the service) even if it was a joke at his expense, he probably doesn't take offense. Heck, my Uncle makes jokes about his leg almost everytime I see him.
        I've never heard more jokes about missing limbs from my friend who had a missing leg. Turn a weakness into a strength. I think the only thing I ever heard he was bothered by was people specifically holding doors for him because he was missing a leg because he said at 75% he was stronger than they were at 100
            That's actually pretty interesting. 

People think that some people can just brush off anything. when something as simple as holding the door open actually bothers them. 

Context is pretty important. And having a loved one joke about something is very different to someone else pointing it out.
                Thats something alot of people do too. Shit Ive had to stop myself from holding open doors for people at university since its not the same vibe as my hometown. 
                    I just hold the door for everybody. If that offends anyone (and it has) that's their personal issue not mine. Sorry for being courteous.
            I mean holding a door open isn't exactly a feat of strength. It's just polite to hold the door even to non disabled people.
            Missing a leg and just wanna add some input into this:

We laugh about it because honestly, you have to. That sounds much, much sadder than it is, but it's simply that your choices are to move on or piss and moan about and let it define you. You meet so many disabled people laughing it off *because* it's like wtf do you want them to do, be a pussy-ass little bitch about the topic their entire lives? What a miserable existence that'd be. *Of course* we laugh it off; you would too, unless you prefer writing poems about the darkness consuming your tortured soul.

On the topic of door-holding and the like, I never got that one or why it upsets some disabled people....until recently. Recent years my prosthetic has become something I can't wear. I have some kind of pain that kicks in after 2-3 hours of wearing it. It's not specific to any one prosthetic and clearly lies within my body. We suspect nerve pains but unfortunately that's hard to prove and to treat in my case. Anyways, I've been on crutches instead. I'm perfectly fine with this and in some ways feel faster/more nimble on crutches since that's a lot of weight no longer hanging onto my leg. (or what I have of one)

This is the thing: I feel more disabled socially and financially than anything else. Tell me to do something, I'll do it. Pretty much the only time I'll say "I can't" is if you ask me to beat someone in a running race, in which case I'll say "wtf asshole," but I'd simultaneously point out honestly, how important is it to be able to run fast in your day-to-day life? (and keyword *run.* I can move fast too, but it's rare you actually have to run somewhere) Anything that you need to do daily...? Man I live alone. I emigrated to another country on my own. I clearly don't have to worry about dependency on anyone or not being able to do something, so as a practical limitation...? It isn't. Depending on the situation, it can be an advantage (countries that offer workplace benefits for X % of disabled workers) or disadvantage. (USA gonna fuck your ass cause how dare you have a disability, gimme your money)

Financial is something that affects me if I'm in the USA, but luckily I'm a dual citizen and can dodge that bullet, yay. 

Socially...? It has become blatantly obvious to me that I am perceived as weaker now that I use crutches instead of my prosthetic. A part of it *can* be pretty miserable, because it's this feeling that no matter what you do, you will not be recognized for it. This is annoying because it eats at you and makes you question if those opportunities that passed you by (new love interest, new job opportunity, whatever) actually passed you by because you underachieved or because someone *perceived* you wouldn't be good enough. It's simply the frustration with not knowing, but also being able to compare something like prosthetic vs. crutches and seeing a clear difference. Constantly using it as an excuse for failures is toxic and a no-go, so the only option is to get even better, but that doesn't make it any less bitter when something doesn't feel deserved.

Speaking for my surroundings for example, I know I walk more than 90% of my collegues and also seem to be stronger (I mean wtf my hands are now my feet too, effectively) than most, but if I and someone I know were to both slip on a wet floor in a supermarket, he might get stared at or laughed at while I'm gonna get this huge pity party coming to make sure I don't need to go to the hospital. Hate it. It's not that I don't appreciate the concern, but rather what gets unintentionally conveyed during those moments is "I don't view you as an equal and I view you as less capable. (even though I just watched you carrying four shopping bags through the store on crutches)"

So yeah, at the end of the day I don't think it's much to do with needing to prove strength or anything, but rather just an ongoing lament that even if **you** personally can overcome your disability, loads of people will never, ever ever recognize this and they will view you as less for it by default. 

My advice for people not wanting to accidently do this? If you encounter a disabled guy going to a door or whatever, just judge if it looks like he wants/expects/is waiting on the help or not. They're not gonna be afraid to tell you they want the help if they do. If they're pausing at the door or something or they seem to slow down as their body language turns towards others, sure. If you JUST watched that guy open two doors after another with no problem, he's turning to leave after buying his stuff, and now you're like "OH HERE LET ME GET OUT FROM BEHIND THIS COUNTER TO HELP YOU, PLEASE WAIT SIR" then it's like 'tf are you blind? 
            A buddy of mine got his legs blown off in Afghanistan and he wears shirts that say all kinda crazy shit. He wore one to the reunion that says ‚ÄúHave you seen my legs?‚Äù He‚Äôs got one with like a frantic looking face on it that says ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt find my legs.‚Äù My favorite one though, it says ‚ÄúSpring Break 2010‚Äù (he got blown up April 2010) in like real vibrant rainbow wavy colors and there‚Äôs an all white picture of an amputee holding his legs up behind it. He‚Äôs awesome. 
            My husband is missing part of a finger and we make stump jokes about it all the time. We wouldn't go up to a rando amputee and start clowning them though.
            i get him being annoyed by it but at the same time its really hard to know whats the right thing to do, either im the asshole who wont hold a door for a disabled person or im the asshole who thinks he cant do it himself
                This is true. The gesture is generally good, but since he could do it well, he liked to. It's a weird slope
            Tell your friend that ppl often hold doors just to be polite and it has nothing to do with his disability.
            Same thing happened for my good friend a little while after his dad passed, he started making dead dad jokes, he loved his dad but it was just for shock value and to fuck with people after a while I got used to it but at first I was like fuckkkk that's dark man and didn't really know what to say.
        In my experience, the majority of people who get offended by certain terms or phrases are people who aren't even affiliated with those terms or phrases.
    The yellow (tier 4) downed shield, brings you back to life..Not sure after how long.
        TIL.

that must be why the game doesn't auto end when you've got 3 ppl knocked down.
            Only on yellow knockdown shield though.
Prob had lvl 4 shield, it have the skill to revive urself.
    That‚Äôs such an incredible item
        It takes a really long time to use though
Pretty sure he was talking about Mirage‚Äôs passive ability
     wiggling around?
He clearly didn't mean it like you think. Listen to the full thing.
I thought he said "aren't you disabled bro?"

Like he was amazed by that play


    no
I hate the word cringe but that was exactly it. It was also kinda funny because of the circumstances. 
    [deleted]
        Because reddit is filled with a LOT of socially awkward people who see cringe everywhere because it is usually them.
        The disabled guy didn't get offended so someone has to get offended for him. 
    I once asked a friend I hadn't seen for some time how come his father gave him his car and what car his father is driving now. Turns out his father has passed a couple of weeks before. I felt awkward after that lol. 
        Not really cringe. Not like you knew. 
    Disabled has multiple meanings. He used one of them. I don't see how that is cringe. You are the one who interprets it as handicapped. Given the context, he was more likely to mean something like:
> to make something or someone unable to act in the correct or usual way
    Downed but not killed is what they were probably asking
I thought the dude said "She must have had one arm" afterwards
[deleted]
    I actually cringed when I read this.
What if you had no choice?   Your brain has to rewire itself and often its a pain in the ass.
    Exactly. He has no choice to adapt and learned to do everything with one hand. 
        Improvise. Adapt. Overcome.

Except unironically.
            ‚ÄúGamers‚Äù
            This but unironically 
    I had my one hand disabled for almost a year because of a surgery. I was amazed at how fast my left hand evolved into something useful. The only problem was writing, I got the letters looking nice and all, but if I didn't pay attention it would try to write in the direction of my right hand. So I accidentally wrote stuff you would need a mirror to read.
That's something I've been practicing for years. Useful for when you want to take a drink, bite, scratch an itch or whatever. Lose a bit of accuracy but it's better than being totally defenceless 
I suck horribly at FPS games. I'm pretty sure a dog chewing on a controller could beat me.
    We've been matched many times on this. 
I am people that can't do that with two fully functioning hands
    Yep, right her as well.
    What an inspirational post, I‚Äôm gonna go drink at the bar....
How do you know me
The last knocked down person he killed had the legendary self revive shield. They were confused as to why the match didnt end when the last enemy got knocked like it usually does.
    This right here. Would've been sweet to end the match with an execution but a win is a win. Props to this dude.
        Oh for sure, he‚Äôs got more than me anyway :D gg
But not all legends are heroes... 

I CAN TELL YOU THIS PERSON IS BOTH A LEGEND AND A HERO!!
I think he's on ps4 and they slackin
    It's compatible on all platforms.

        Same, haven't gotten a kill yet, at this point I'm gonna see how high I can get in rank before that happens. I'm rank 7 right now üòÅ
            Hahaha same and it's tragic. I'm at level 9 right now with 0 kills. It's very disheartening but I just keep hoping I'll get better someday.
                Don't give up, you'll get there! BR can be really rough at first, especially against seasoned players of the genre.
        You realise that's because most console shooters have some degree of auto-aim with controllers right?
            No thats not the reason. Yes I realize many games have that but I am not talking about that.

A controller is not a very good tool to aim. However I had only controllers as a kid and are really used to it. I can aim pretty good with a controler. If I would play against a clone of me who would have a mouse I would most likely win with the mouse. But I am only playing against people who also have controllers and as far as controller aim goes I would consider myself pretty good.

A mouse gives you a way higher skill sceiling than a controller. I am not really good at aiming with a mouse but if you can do this you are way better than any controller user ever could be. Therefore I get way more shit on in computer games. 

That isnt a bad thing at all, I was just pointing out that my mouse aim really isnt good at all - it was pretty okay when I was 13 years old and played counterstrike 1.6 but after that (and a brief source phase) I didnt really played any shooters anymore... now im 28 and I have a real hard time catching up. The game is still super fun tho
    I was used to mouse + keyboard, but month ago i switched to ps4 and i am not good at fps games.
        Imagine you're painting alongside bob ross. You have your paint brush in your hand. You make wide sweeping strokes to begin the painting. Your whole arm is into it. As the painting comes to a close and you begin on finer details you start to use more of your wrist and fine control of your fingers. It is finally finished. Now take out a fresh canvas. You paint the same thing but this time you have two brushes taped to your thumbs instead. You cant touch the brushes with any of your fingers and cant move the rest of your arm. This is what it's like to play keyboard and mouse vs controller for those with experience. But its okay because everyone on console is limited in the same way too. Cant wait for crossplay when I can start wrecking people's thumb-only paintings.
            [deleted]
I was happy when I got my first 3 kills in a game, then I saw a champion in the next game who had 452 kills...like, what?
>And i cant kill no one

So you can kill someone?
he lost it in a motrocycle accident.
    [pic taken moments before the crash](https://thumbs.worthpoint.com/zoom/images2/1/0717/09/army-ww2-african-american-military_1_d9d6a64d9a30dea8844069c2bcd7cc36.jpg)
Theres another guy that was like this but worst. No arms and Global Elite in CSGO. He was a streamer but I forgot his name.
I was seeing if anybody else had brought this up! I think this would be great if Ben could send this guy one! Really test out Ben's design.
People keep commenting this, but he's talking about the enemy being downed ("disabled") but they didn't die, even tho they were the last alive. Normally the game would end, but they must have had a self-revive, which is super rare to find. So, when he shot them again, they fully died. That's why they were confused.
    no he said disabled referring to just like waddling around and not shooting them as they were rezzing
Seems like he doesn‚Äôt need one. I honestly can‚Äôt see how that aim can be improved further; dude lines that shot up faster than I could have.
Wait a sec. This guy's not "one armed". He's wearing a green sleeve and glove on his right side!
In this circumstance, I think it‚Äôs provides some context to ‚Äúhow did his lose his arm!?‚Äù
    No because he lost it in a motorcycle accident 
    I think the best response to that is "why does it matter"?
Show some GOD DAMN RESPECT YOU TERRORIST. /S

When you don't show respect to the military in America. 
Colorblind mode
    K thanks
        yw
How do you know he's not getting proper care ? 
    As a veteran as well, if that happened in the service, that man has a fat paycheck from the VA every month for the rest of his life. Obviously that will never make up for the loss of arm, but it's a start. Just agreeing with you here.
        his loss of arm has nothing to do with the military.
            Well then the military is not responsible as they were not the cause of the accident.

Edit: This sounds more close minded than I meant. The government should take care of him and im sure they do somewhat through disability.
    The fact that 10 percent of the us homeless pop are veterans. 90% of which have mental illness, which includes drug abuse.  I think around 40 percent of vets with gov sponsored loans lose their homes. 10k to 50 or 60k a year with two missing legs isn't a fat check by today's cost of living.  Veterans access to healthcare is no way for to effective. Maybe he is getting care, but he is one out of a hundred at best. Point is, as a whole, no veterans are getting taken care of properly.
        [deleted]
        he's obviously getting proper care from the government and is not homeless considering he's streaming games
He lost his arm in a motorcycle accident.
Asking americans not to warship the ground soldiers walk on is ambitious. They tend to be waaaay too indoctrinated.
    Warship Jesus, walks on water, dominates sea warfare.
Well said
Imagine turning this cool victory into your own agenda. Imagine being that selfish.
    Mentioning that someone deserves "nothing but respect," while people are calling him a hero, thanking him for his service, and conspicuously pointing out his veteran status over and over is already an agenda. No need to turn it into anything, I'm just making a point.
    Yeah mate no agenda to be found in this post lmao
u/SaxPanther makes a semi-decent point. A one armed gamer doesn't 'deserve respect' - there are many things out there in this world that do, but just this footage alone isn't respectworthy. Amazing skills though.
Overreacting little bit there buddy.. Respect for the guy on how he handles playing this game with his physical disability. 
    Agreed but why is their former occupation relevant?  If he was a disabled former McDonalds cook, would it be less impressive?
First of all, nobody called him a hero you fucking parrot, and second, he clearly is one going for the res in the open like that.

Reddit likes to circlejerk anything related to veterans even though people like ToeYouUp literally contribute to ruining the lives of millions. It doesn't matter what you do when you sign up, because your skills can be appropriated towards a cause that hurts individuals. The military machine of western forces like the US military steals other countries' natural resources or tries to establish regional control through destabilizing other governments.
Do me a favor and take a big step back and literally fuck your own face.

Hey screw you man. Seriously get out of here. You took this wholesome post and made it political. You‚Äôre what‚Äôs wrong with the world, you‚Äôre so focused on politics that you have to push your ideals on everything. You crusade your beliefs so hard that you ruin enjoyable moments. Check your politics at the door, games are meant to be fun 
    US soldiers don't deserve any respect and title says otherwise.
        None of them do? Man you're cynical. 
        Why? 
            [deleted]
    Then his former occupation shouldn't have been included in the title.
The respect here isn't because he lost his limbs. It doesn't matter how he lost them. The respect here is for the sheer willpower and determination to work through all that shit and still come out on top.
They're celebrated far too much as it is.
    This is the stupidest thing I have heard for a very long time
        Sorry to hurt your feelings, but mainstream American society already treats veterans like flawless heroes.  This isn't debatable,  it's simple recognition of reality.

And considering America hasn't had a justified conflict in decades, its frankly ridiculous. 
He fought for your country and just won a battleroyale game with 1 arm .. 
    Great on him, people wake up everyday and do the exact same thing, not even having to fight for my country. 
He could be an asshole in real life/etc.

You ain‚Äôt earning my respect just cause we assume you are a great person getting beyond a handicap.

    Oh thanku man.
Hey there. I am the teammate UNCC\_\_49er or [N](https://Twitch.tv/NickTheGrizzly)ickTheGrizzly on Twitch.

And here's an easy link to his channel [Twitch.tv/ToeYouUp](https://Twitch.tv/ToeYouUp)

I'm really good friends with @ToeYouUp and I said "Disabled" and I definitely meant "Down, but not out". This was before I knew that you could do a Self-Revive with the level 3 knockdown shield.
    No hate for the shameless self promotion but why not a a one click link to his twitch as well?
        You right. Edited. I thought I saw a high up-voted link to his Twitch, might have been another post.

Someone with clout post an easy link to his Twitch. Haha.

"[Twitch.tv/ToeYouUp](https://Twitch.tv/ToeYouUp)'

;)

&#x200B;
    I think it's technically level 4
        Oh yes... You are right. It's def level 4 - Gold.
Thanks for catching that. ;)
    Thanks for hitting me up. I didn‚Äôt think there was any malice in the statement, I just found the whole exchange amusing, and a little ironic. Props on the win, brother.
I think he meant like, 'stunned or unable to attack' as opposed to a pejorative or intentionally ableist language.
    Obviously, hence the use of irony and not assholery.
        i hate both of you
        Irony also applies to his teammate being disabled, so no, not obvious. 
            Oh wow. Okay.
                Is there a reason you're argumentative?

The situation would be ironic if they were attempting to insult the last player for their poor aim. IE, they must be disabled because they couldn't kill us.
        He is missing an arm but he doesn‚Äôt seem disabled. Love it
    I can't believe we're using "ableist" unironically now. What have we become...
I heard that too lol.

I was like, "uhhhhhh Hawkward." 
    Not really, there's weapons in the game that disable your character by fucking up your screen so you can't see.
        [deleted]
            Honestly I thought he was reacting when he stopped leaning back
                A legless dude once told us he had a great relationship with his brother because his brother didn't treat his disability as this awkward taboo thing. 

His brother cracks legless jokes, occasionally puts stuff out of reach just to fuck with him. True love?
                    I don't think there's a golden rule for situations like this. They require empathy on the part of both sides - one, to understand the other's current acceptance of what is being discussed; two, to know the limit between a joke and hurting the person.

I think yeah, his brother is showing true love.  Fucking with your siblings is a time-honored tradition.
                    I mean between good friends I doubt that kind of stuff is off limits, if those were his friends I bet one of them made a joke about the enemy playing with one arm. 
            I think we all get that he meant downed. It's still funny.
                I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs not cringy and not awkward at all. 

Coincidentally funny? Yeah I‚Äôm not gonna try to claim it isn‚Äôt funny by coincidence. 

It‚Äôs definitely not irony tho. 
                    True. A lot of people do seem to think the guy genuinely reacted to the word disabled. 
    I'm pretty sure they meant if he was one of the downed players. If you get the gold shield you can self revive.
        I got the gold shield once but already after my team disconnected, so no self revive for me.
            I really thought it would let me revive even with no team. Was disappointed to find that out
    That put the ‚Äòdiss‚Äô in abled. 
I'm pretty sure he meant disabled not in a physical or mental sense but that an in game ability disabled her character from acting properly. Still not the best phrasing lol
    No, the phrasing was perfectly fine. I get the feeling that man isn't a pussy who wants people to tiptoe around using the word "disabled" just because he's had some shit happen to him
        Im disabled and idc if people say shit like that lol

        Also looks like he is on PS4, does the adaptive work on any console like that? That would be pretty damn awesome.
            I believe so, and if not, we can find a solution.
                We have the technology

                        But man, I wish it was. 
                I believe the adaptive controller is all hardware based, so if you get a converter to use Xbox controllers on PS4 and vice versa, you can set it up to work.
    TOEYOUUP ARE YOU OUT THERE  PLEASE RESPOND
Since no one has said it yet, thank you for doing this.
send him a message on twitch as well, more likely he is going to see that

Hey what‚Äôs the name of the non profit? You can pm if it‚Äôs not allowed.

Hi! Also another veteran. I only have one hand and I have found many useful products to help.

Check this out https://www.benheck.com/controllers/

I have that. He's also making a PS4 controller.

For PC, I use https://www.3drudder.com and https://www.google.com/amp/s/m.newegg.com/amp/products/0TP-0013-00002
Doesn‚Äôt matter. Microsoft made the controller to work on any platform 
    Thats really cool of them but also smart. Sony has nothing like it so anyone who is on ps4 has no choice but to buy microsofts. Did they have to work some sort of deal out with sony?
        Possibly, but I don‚Äôt think so. It‚Äôs technically not an Xbox product. I‚Äôd assume it‚Äôs the same as buying one of the Sony macros to use on Xbox 
            Ahh i see
                Yep :)
            But it has an Xbox button on it?
                ‚ÄòTechnically‚Äô Sony aren‚Äôt very fond of using other products with theirs.
                    Hey at least headphones work easily on their systems now, unlike the mess that was using a headset with ps3s. My PC Cloud II can easily plug in and out of my ps4 
                        What was the issue with headsets on ps3? For me it worked fine.
                    I think in this case the PR blowback of not allowing it would be severe enough for them to allow it.
        Imagine the internet rage if Xbox said something like "we wanted to let the disabled PS4 players use it too but Sony declined"
            Yikes. That would be a nightmare for sony. Never thought of it like that
                Sony isn't allowing it to work out of the box just yet. Sony being Sony =/
        No it‚Äôs a Microsoft controller and not specific to Xbox, works on all platforms the same way usb controllers can work on pc. 
        it's not technically an xbox product. It's more like using a sony headset that can work with any platform
        Not to mention it'd look like a real dick move to block it, not that Japanese companies give a shit about what westerners think
    Does it actually work on any platform now? I know they were planning on adding support but didn't think it was already done
        I‚Äôm about 80% sure it is. Their main focus was to make it accessible to anyone regardless of what they play on so I‚Äôm assuming it was a priority. If not then it‚Äôs just Sony being selfish 
            Unfortunately at the moment it is not officially compatible with the PS4. Microsoft does want it compatible with every platform and it is a really cool product :)

There are work arounds though!

https://youtu.be/p3p1RTpW4SI
                Just when you think Sony's greed finally reached its limit. They force you to use work arounds for adaptive controllers. They have no souls.
                    Are you sure Sony is at fault here? 
                        Sony's track record doesn't really merit the benefit of the doubt.
                            I‚Äôm not familiar with their track record. What have they done?
                        no they don't, but we have to be angry at someone damn it!
            Their track record isn't the best but it's kinda hard to refuse something like this. Would have been a huge media backfire that would have force them to do it anyway.
                That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs going to happen. Doesn‚Äôt matter if Sony refuse to allow Microsoft products on their services, this is about allowing anyone to game no matter who they are. 
    No they didn't. You have to buy an unofficial adapter to make it work on ps4. 
    No they didn‚Äôt - you have to use 3rd party dongles if you want to use it on a PS4 (don‚Äôt know about other systems) Those do however seem to work fine with the dongles, but there is no native support for anything other than Xbox hardware currently 
    Uhh.. [really?](https://i.imgur.com/xgm3slg.jpg)
He could get a xim apex and use an Xbox controller
    It works on all platforms by default.
        Did not know that, that‚Äôs pretty cool. 
        Can't do analogue input on PS4 though, because it detects it as a generic directinput controller
        That's very cool of ms to do  I thought it was just Xbox and was like that's awesome sucks for everyone else though 
    Ive never seen the adaptive controller used. Is it just plug the switches into the board and play or do you have to do some stuff on the xbox its self to program it?
        https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/17/17363964/microsoft-xbox-adaptive-controller-announced-price-release-date

He‚Äôd be able to for example put all buttons in his hand along with movement stick and ADS button and maybe leave the aim stick and trigger to his feet along with maybe the ping button and he can sit comfortably.
            That would be really cool. That has got to be super uncomfortable. 
                How uncomfortable do you think it would be? https://youtu.be/_YISTzpLXCY

Looks like he doesn't have a left handed prototype yet.
    He has a video on it and says that he usually uses his right hand to mail the protyping (as he's right handed) but isn't hard for him to flip and adjust for left hands
because walking with WASD?
    There are mice that have basically an entire numpad on the side, you could easily bind the movement keys there.
I have used a mouse with 12 buttons on it and I can tell you that it‚Äôs really hard (Almost impossible) to press two separate buttons at once unless they are touching.  In fps games you need to be able to do multiple things at once. Like slide and reload or strafe and cast ultimate. Etc a controller makes more sense when you take into account multiple simultaneous actions.

    Plot twist: he painted his arm green. 
        I'm so dissappointed in myself for laughing at this... Much respect to this guy but I can't help it
            I‚Äôm sure if he‚Äôs on twitch he has a decent humor about it
                Oh I'm sure he does, just doesn't mean I'm not a terrible human being haha
                    You're not a terrible human. Shit's funny. I've never met an amputee that didn't already have a million jokes of their own about their disability. I'm a below knee amputee and my first name just happens to rhyme with "peg leg". Guess how I introduce myself to people. 
            He'd probably laugh with you. That's part of how people deal with trouble - if you let your ailments define you, it just holds you down.  You've got to take the hand you're dealt and move forward. 

ToeYouUp, if you see this - thank you for your service. I hope to see you in Apex, mate. 
                hehe "hand youre dealt"
                    I uh... Whoops. 
        That reminds me of that one streamer that was in a wheelchair and then just stood up on accident.
            That's the thing everyone can get up out of a wheelchair,  it just needs to be on accident.
    It takes more than skill. It takes bal...it takes a lack of balls.
His shorts were green so you couldnt seen them bc he was utilising a green screen
    Oh lmao, didn‚Äôt realize it was a joke. I get it now ;)
As opposed to?
Or PC, since it's also compatible
    Or PS4, since it's also compatible
        or my axe 
            [deleted]
                Or Patrick 
                More like combat able amirite??
        It's detected as a generic controller though, so no analogue input
    Pretty sure it's also compatible with PS4

        With some workarounds ya. Sony hasn't officially allowed their stuff to connect with it out the box. 
    Well, then there would be players who can aim that he'd have to race.
        Get him a mouse with a shit load of buttons, they exist
Turn on your monitor?
I had that problem initially, you get used to it.
Yeah, this is my one complaint so far, the enemies blend a lot with the environment and it's pretty hard to distinguish enemies and friends.
    Really? For me enemies stand out way too much regardless of environment xD. But then again I come from Battlefield 5 where visibility is a bitch so I must be used to that...
        I could never see enemies in any Battlefield game, so yeah your eyes must be used to that. 
        Literally the one good thing about BFV's visibility

Other games: visibility is bad

    1) turn off volumetric lighting, that can help make enemies easier to spot against glare

2) Have you checked out the accessibility options in Apex? There's a color blind mode that might make it easier for you to spot enemies by changing how they are displayed
    The enemies sorta glow? What are you guys talking about lol. So easy to see people
        Wot? I haven't noticed that at all. Did it come out in an update in the last 24 hours?
            No. 
                As far as I'm aware, enemies only glow once you've pegged their shields once.  Otherwise, they don't glow at all.  I've had a really difficult time distinguishing enemies when I first started playing, but once you start looking for movement instead it become easier.
    That's strange I have a a red green brown color issue where I have an issue with most games and spotting people. Pubg was horrible for me. 


I‚Äôm the same way man, I feel literally blind playing this game.  I‚Äôll die alll the time and not see my enemies.  
Saaame. I can't hit shit cuz I cant see during a firefight. I played it for like a day then went back to Overwatch and immediately had a seven game win streak cuz it's so much easier to see people in Overwatch üòÇ
No don't I only got two kills in last three rounds but practice makes purpose think of this guy he didn't give up even with one arm. 
Probably, but in my experience (having an uncle who lost a leg in the service) even if it was a joke at his expense, he probably doesn't take offense. Heck, my Uncle makes jokes about his leg almost everytime I see him.
    I've never heard more jokes about missing limbs from my friend who had a missing leg. Turn a weakness into a strength. I think the only thing I ever heard he was bothered by was people specifically holding doors for him because he was missing a leg because he said at 75% he was stronger than they were at 100
        That's actually pretty interesting. 

People think that some people can just brush off anything. when something as simple as holding the door open actually bothers them. 

Context is pretty important. And having a loved one joke about something is very different to someone else pointing it out.
            Thats something alot of people do too. Shit Ive had to stop myself from holding open doors for people at university since its not the same vibe as my hometown. 
                I just hold the door for everybody. If that offends anyone (and it has) that's their personal issue not mine. Sorry for being courteous.
        I mean holding a door open isn't exactly a feat of strength. It's just polite to hold the door even to non disabled people.
        Missing a leg and just wanna add some input into this:

We laugh about it because honestly, you have to. That sounds much, much sadder than it is, but it's simply that your choices are to move on or piss and moan about and let it define you. You meet so many disabled people laughing it off *because* it's like wtf do you want them to do, be a pussy-ass little bitch about the topic their entire lives? What a miserable existence that'd be. *Of course* we laugh it off; you would too, unless you prefer writing poems about the darkness consuming your tortured soul.

On the topic of door-holding and the like, I never got that one or why it upsets some disabled people....until recently. Recent years my prosthetic has become something I can't wear. I have some kind of pain that kicks in after 2-3 hours of wearing it. It's not specific to any one prosthetic and clearly lies within my body. We suspect nerve pains but unfortunately that's hard to prove and to treat in my case. Anyways, I've been on crutches instead. I'm perfectly fine with this and in some ways feel faster/more nimble on crutches since that's a lot of weight no longer hanging onto my leg. (or what I have of one)

This is the thing: I feel more disabled socially and financially than anything else. Tell me to do something, I'll do it. Pretty much the only time I'll say "I can't" is if you ask me to beat someone in a running race, in which case I'll say "wtf asshole," but I'd simultaneously point out honestly, how important is it to be able to run fast in your day-to-day life? (and keyword *run.* I can move fast too, but it's rare you actually have to run somewhere) Anything that you need to do daily...? Man I live alone. I emigrated to another country on my own. I clearly don't have to worry about dependency on anyone or not being able to do something, so as a practical limitation...? It isn't. Depending on the situation, it can be an advantage (countries that offer workplace benefits for X % of disabled workers) or disadvantage. (USA gonna fuck your ass cause how dare you have a disability, gimme your money)

Financial is something that affects me if I'm in the USA, but luckily I'm a dual citizen and can dodge that bullet, yay. 

Socially...? It has become blatantly obvious to me that I am perceived as weaker now that I use crutches instead of my prosthetic. A part of it *can* be pretty miserable, because it's this feeling that no matter what you do, you will not be recognized for it. This is annoying because it eats at you and makes you question if those opportunities that passed you by (new love interest, new job opportunity, whatever) actually passed you by because you underachieved or because someone *perceived* you wouldn't be good enough. It's simply the frustration with not knowing, but also being able to compare something like prosthetic vs. crutches and seeing a clear difference. Constantly using it as an excuse for failures is toxic and a no-go, so the only option is to get even better, but that doesn't make it any less bitter when something doesn't feel deserved.

Speaking for my surroundings for example, I know I walk more than 90% of my collegues and also seem to be stronger (I mean wtf my hands are now my feet too, effectively) than most, but if I and someone I know were to both slip on a wet floor in a supermarket, he might get stared at or laughed at while I'm gonna get this huge pity party coming to make sure I don't need to go to the hospital. Hate it. It's not that I don't appreciate the concern, but rather what gets unintentionally conveyed during those moments is "I don't view you as an equal and I view you as less capable. (even though I just watched you carrying four shopping bags through the store on crutches)"

So yeah, at the end of the day I don't think it's much to do with needing to prove strength or anything, but rather just an ongoing lament that even if **you** personally can overcome your disability, loads of people will never, ever ever recognize this and they will view you as less for it by default. 

My advice for people not wanting to accidently do this? If you encounter a disabled guy going to a door or whatever, just judge if it looks like he wants/expects/is waiting on the help or not. They're not gonna be afraid to tell you they want the help if they do. If they're pausing at the door or something or they seem to slow down as their body language turns towards others, sure. If you JUST watched that guy open two doors after another with no problem, he's turning to leave after buying his stuff, and now you're like "OH HERE LET ME GET OUT FROM BEHIND THIS COUNTER TO HELP YOU, PLEASE WAIT SIR" then it's like 'tf are you blind? 
        A buddy of mine got his legs blown off in Afghanistan and he wears shirts that say all kinda crazy shit. He wore one to the reunion that says ‚ÄúHave you seen my legs?‚Äù He‚Äôs got one with like a frantic looking face on it that says ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt find my legs.‚Äù My favorite one though, it says ‚ÄúSpring Break 2010‚Äù (he got blown up April 2010) in like real vibrant rainbow wavy colors and there‚Äôs an all white picture of an amputee holding his legs up behind it. He‚Äôs awesome. 
        My husband is missing part of a finger and we make stump jokes about it all the time. We wouldn't go up to a rando amputee and start clowning them though.
        i get him being annoyed by it but at the same time its really hard to know whats the right thing to do, either im the asshole who wont hold a door for a disabled person or im the asshole who thinks he cant do it himself
            This is true. The gesture is generally good, but since he could do it well, he liked to. It's a weird slope
        Tell your friend that ppl often hold doors just to be polite and it has nothing to do with his disability.
        Same thing happened for my good friend a little while after his dad passed, he started making dead dad jokes, he loved his dad but it was just for shock value and to fuck with people after a while I got used to it but at first I was like fuckkkk that's dark man and didn't really know what to say.
    In my experience, the majority of people who get offended by certain terms or phrases are people who aren't even affiliated with those terms or phrases.
The yellow (tier 4) downed shield, brings you back to life..Not sure after how long.
    TIL.

that must be why the game doesn't auto end when you've got 3 ppl knocked down.
        Only on yellow knockdown shield though.
That‚Äôs such an incredible item
    It takes a really long time to use though
 wiggling around?
no
[deleted]
    Because reddit is filled with a LOT of socially awkward people who see cringe everywhere because it is usually them.
    The disabled guy didn't get offended so someone has to get offended for him. 
I once asked a friend I hadn't seen for some time how come his father gave him his car and what car his father is driving now. Turns out his father has passed a couple of weeks before. I felt awkward after that lol. 
    Not really cringe. Not like you knew. 
Disabled has multiple meanings. He used one of them. I don't see how that is cringe. You are the one who interprets it as handicapped. Given the context, he was more likely to mean something like:
> to make something or someone unable to act in the correct or usual way
Downed but not killed is what they were probably asking
I actually cringed when I read this.
Exactly. He has no choice to adapt and learned to do everything with one hand. 
    Improvise. Adapt. Overcome.

Except unironically.
        ‚ÄúGamers‚Äù
        This but unironically 
I had my one hand disabled for almost a year because of a surgery. I was amazed at how fast my left hand evolved into something useful. The only problem was writing, I got the letters looking nice and all, but if I didn't pay attention it would try to write in the direction of my right hand. So I accidentally wrote stuff you would need a mirror to read.
We've been matched many times on this. 
Yep, right her as well.
What an inspirational post, I‚Äôm gonna go drink at the bar....
This right here. Would've been sweet to end the match with an execution but a win is a win. Props to this dude.
    Oh for sure, he‚Äôs got more than me anyway :D gg
It's compatible on all platforms.
[deleted]
    Same, haven't gotten a kill yet, at this point I'm gonna see how high I can get in rank before that happens. I'm rank 7 right now üòÅ
        Hahaha same and it's tragic. I'm at level 9 right now with 0 kills. It's very disheartening but I just keep hoping I'll get better someday.
            Don't give up, you'll get there! BR can be really rough at first, especially against seasoned players of the genre.
    You realise that's because most console shooters have some degree of auto-aim with controllers right?
        No thats not the reason. Yes I realize many games have that but I am not talking about that.

A controller is not a very good tool to aim. However I had only controllers as a kid and are really used to it. I can aim pretty good with a controler. If I would play against a clone of me who would have a mouse I would most likely win with the mouse. But I am only playing against people who also have controllers and as far as controller aim goes I would consider myself pretty good.

A mouse gives you a way higher skill sceiling than a controller. I am not really good at aiming with a mouse but if you can do this you are way better than any controller user ever could be. Therefore I get way more shit on in computer games. 

That isnt a bad thing at all, I was just pointing out that my mouse aim really isnt good at all - it was pretty okay when I was 13 years old and played counterstrike 1.6 but after that (and a brief source phase) I didnt really played any shooters anymore... now im 28 and I have a real hard time catching up. The game is still super fun tho
I was used to mouse + keyboard, but month ago i switched to ps4 and i am not good at fps games.
    Imagine you're painting alongside bob ross. You have your paint brush in your hand. You make wide sweeping strokes to begin the painting. Your whole arm is into it. As the painting comes to a close and you begin on finer details you start to use more of your wrist and fine control of your fingers. It is finally finished. Now take out a fresh canvas. You paint the same thing but this time you have two brushes taped to your thumbs instead. You cant touch the brushes with any of your fingers and cant move the rest of your arm. This is what it's like to play keyboard and mouse vs controller for those with experience. But its okay because everyone on console is limited in the same way too. Cant wait for crossplay when I can start wrecking people's thumb-only paintings.

no he said disabled referring to just like waddling around and not shooting them as they were rezzing
No because he lost it in a motorcycle accident 
I think the best response to that is "why does it matter"?
K thanks
    yw
As a veteran as well, if that happened in the service, that man has a fat paycheck from the VA every month for the rest of his life. Obviously that will never make up for the loss of arm, but it's a start. Just agreeing with you here.
    his loss of arm has nothing to do with the military.
        Well then the military is not responsible as they were not the cause of the accident.

Edit: This sounds more close minded than I meant. The government should take care of him and im sure they do somewhat through disability.
The fact that 10 percent of the us homeless pop are veterans. 90% of which have mental illness, which includes drug abuse.  I think around 40 percent of vets with gov sponsored loans lose their homes. 10k to 50 or 60k a year with two missing legs isn't a fat check by today's cost of living.  Veterans access to healthcare is no way for to effective. Maybe he is getting care, but he is one out of a hundred at best. Point is, as a whole, no veterans are getting taken care of properly.
    [deleted]
    he's obviously getting proper care from the government and is not homeless considering he's streaming games
Warship Jesus, walks on water, dominates sea warfare.
Mentioning that someone deserves "nothing but respect," while people are calling him a hero, thanking him for his service, and conspicuously pointing out his veteran status over and over is already an agenda. No need to turn it into anything, I'm just making a point.
Yeah mate no agenda to be found in this post lmao
Agreed but why is their former occupation relevant?  If he was a disabled former McDonalds cook, would it be less impressive?

    Why? 
        [deleted]
Then his former occupation shouldn't have been included in the title.
This is the stupidest thing I have heard for a very long time
    Sorry to hurt your feelings, but mainstream American society already treats veterans like flawless heroes.  This isn't debatable,  it's simple recognition of reality.

And considering America hasn't had a justified conflict in decades, its frankly ridiculous. 
Great on him, people wake up everyday and do the exact same thing, not even having to fight for my country. 
He could be an asshole in real life/etc.

You ain‚Äôt earning my respect just cause we assume you are a great person getting beyond a handicap.
    [removed]
Oh thanku man.
No hate for the shameless self promotion but why not a a one click link to his twitch as well?
    You right. Edited. I thought I saw a high up-voted link to his Twitch, might have been another post.

Someone with clout post an easy link to his Twitch. Haha.

I think it's technically level 4
    Oh yes... You are right. It's def level 4 - Gold.
Thanks for catching that. ;)
Thanks for hitting me up. I didn‚Äôt think there was any malice in the statement, I just found the whole exchange amusing, and a little ironic. Props on the win, brother.
Obviously, hence the use of irony and not assholery.
    i hate both of you
    Irony also applies to his teammate being disabled, so no, not obvious. 
        Oh wow. Okay.
            Is there a reason you're argumentative?

The situation would be ironic if they were attempting to insult the last player for their poor aim. IE, they must be disabled because they couldn't kill us.
    He is missing an arm but he doesn‚Äôt seem disabled. Love it
I can't believe we're using "ableist" unironically now. What have we become...
Not really, there's weapons in the game that disable your character by fucking up your screen so you can't see.
    [deleted]
        Honestly I thought he was reacting when he stopped leaning back
            A legless dude once told us he had a great relationship with his brother because his brother didn't treat his disability as this awkward taboo thing. 

His brother cracks legless jokes, occasionally puts stuff out of reach just to fuck with him. True love?
                I don't think there's a golden rule for situations like this. They require empathy on the part of both sides - one, to understand the other's current acceptance of what is being discussed; two, to know the limit between a joke and hurting the person.

I think yeah, his brother is showing true love.  Fucking with your siblings is a time-honored tradition.
                I mean between good friends I doubt that kind of stuff is off limits, if those were his friends I bet one of them made a joke about the enemy playing with one arm. 
        I think we all get that he meant downed. It's still funny.
            I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs not cringy and not awkward at all. 

Coincidentally funny? Yeah I‚Äôm not gonna try to claim it isn‚Äôt funny by coincidence. 

It‚Äôs definitely not irony tho. 
                True. A lot of people do seem to think the guy genuinely reacted to the word disabled. 
I'm pretty sure they meant if he was one of the downed players. If you get the gold shield you can self revive.
    I got the gold shield once but already after my team disconnected, so no self revive for me.
        I really thought it would let me revive even with no team. Was disappointed to find that out
That put the ‚Äòdiss‚Äô in abled. 
No, the phrasing was perfectly fine. I get the feeling that man isn't a pussy who wants people to tiptoe around using the word "disabled" just because he's had some shit happen to him
    Im disabled and idc if people say shit like that lol

    Also looks like he is on PS4, does the adaptive work on any console like that? That would be pretty damn awesome.
        I believe so, and if not, we can find a solution.
            We have the technology

                    But man, I wish it was. 
            I believe the adaptive controller is all hardware based, so if you get a converter to use Xbox controllers on PS4 and vice versa, you can set it up to work.
TOEYOUUP ARE YOU OUT THERE  PLEASE RESPOND
Thats really cool of them but also smart. Sony has nothing like it so anyone who is on ps4 has no choice but to buy microsofts. Did they have to work some sort of deal out with sony?
    Possibly, but I don‚Äôt think so. It‚Äôs technically not an Xbox product. I‚Äôd assume it‚Äôs the same as buying one of the Sony macros to use on Xbox 
        Ahh i see
            Yep :)
        But it has an Xbox button on it?
            ‚ÄòTechnically‚Äô Sony aren‚Äôt very fond of using other products with theirs.
                Hey at least headphones work easily on their systems now, unlike the mess that was using a headset with ps3s. My PC Cloud II can easily plug in and out of my ps4 
                    What was the issue with headsets on ps3? For me it worked fine.
                I think in this case the PR blowback of not allowing it would be severe enough for them to allow it.
    Imagine the internet rage if Xbox said something like "we wanted to let the disabled PS4 players use it too but Sony declined"
        Yikes. That would be a nightmare for sony. Never thought of it like that
            Sony isn't allowing it to work out of the box just yet. Sony being Sony =/
    No it‚Äôs a Microsoft controller and not specific to Xbox, works on all platforms the same way usb controllers can work on pc. 
    it's not technically an xbox product. It's more like using a sony headset that can work with any platform
    Not to mention it'd look like a real dick move to block it, not that Japanese companies give a shit about what westerners think
Does it actually work on any platform now? I know they were planning on adding support but didn't think it was already done
    I‚Äôm about 80% sure it is. Their main focus was to make it accessible to anyone regardless of what they play on so I‚Äôm assuming it was a priority. If not then it‚Äôs just Sony being selfish 
        Unfortunately at the moment it is not officially compatible with the PS4. Microsoft does want it compatible with every platform and it is a really cool product :)

There are work arounds though!

https://youtu.be/p3p1RTpW4SI
            Just when you think Sony's greed finally reached its limit. They force you to use work arounds for adaptive controllers. They have no souls.
                Are you sure Sony is at fault here? 
                    Sony's track record doesn't really merit the benefit of the doubt.
                        I‚Äôm not familiar with their track record. What have they done?
                    no they don't, but we have to be angry at someone damn it!
        Their track record isn't the best but it's kinda hard to refuse something like this. Would have been a huge media backfire that would have force them to do it anyway.
            That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs going to happen. Doesn‚Äôt matter if Sony refuse to allow Microsoft products on their services, this is about allowing anyone to game no matter who they are. 
No they didn't. You have to buy an unofficial adapter to make it work on ps4. 
No they didn‚Äôt - you have to use 3rd party dongles if you want to use it on a PS4 (don‚Äôt know about other systems) Those do however seem to work fine with the dongles, but there is no native support for anything other than Xbox hardware currently 
Uhh.. [really?](https://i.imgur.com/xgm3slg.jpg)
It works on all platforms by default.
    Did not know that, that‚Äôs pretty cool. 
    Can't do analogue input on PS4 though, because it detects it as a generic directinput controller
    That's very cool of ms to do  I thought it was just Xbox and was like that's awesome sucks for everyone else though 
Ive never seen the adaptive controller used. Is it just plug the switches into the board and play or do you have to do some stuff on the xbox its self to program it?
    https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/17/17363964/microsoft-xbox-adaptive-controller-announced-price-release-date

He‚Äôd be able to for example put all buttons in his hand along with movement stick and ADS button and maybe leave the aim stick and trigger to his feet along with maybe the ping button and he can sit comfortably.
        That would be really cool. That has got to be super uncomfortable. 
            How uncomfortable do you think it would be? https://youtu.be/_YISTzpLXCY

Is there a way to give it back? I dont know much about the medals.

He has a video on it and says that he usually uses his right hand to mail the protyping (as he's right handed) but isn't hard for him to flip and adjust for left hands
There are mice that have basically an entire numpad on the side, you could easily bind the movement keys there.
Plot twist: he painted his arm green. 
    I'm so dissappointed in myself for laughing at this... Much respect to this guy but I can't help it
        I‚Äôm sure if he‚Äôs on twitch he has a decent humor about it
            Oh I'm sure he does, just doesn't mean I'm not a terrible human being haha
                You're not a terrible human. Shit's funny. I've never met an amputee that didn't already have a million jokes of their own about their disability. I'm a below knee amputee and my first name just happens to rhyme with "peg leg". Guess how I introduce myself to people. 
        He'd probably laugh with you. That's part of how people deal with trouble - if you let your ailments define you, it just holds you down.  You've got to take the hand you're dealt and move forward. 

ToeYouUp, if you see this - thank you for your service. I hope to see you in Apex, mate. 
            hehe "hand youre dealt"
                I uh... Whoops. 
    That reminds me of that one streamer that was in a wheelchair and then just stood up on accident.
        That's the thing everyone can get up out of a wheelchair,  it just needs to be on accident.
It takes more than skill. It takes bal...it takes a lack of balls.
Oh lmao, didn‚Äôt realize it was a joke. I get it now ;)
Or PS4, since it's also compatible
    or my axe

            Or Patrick 
            More like combat able amirite??
    It's detected as a generic controller though, so no analogue input
Pretty sure it's also compatible with PS4

    With some workarounds ya. Sony hasn't officially allowed their stuff to connect with it out the box. 
Well, then there would be players who can aim that he'd have to race.
    Get him a mouse with a shit load of buttons, they exist

I've never heard more jokes about missing limbs from my friend who had a missing leg. Turn a weakness into a strength. I think the only thing I ever heard he was bothered by was people specifically holding doors for him because he was missing a leg because he said at 75% he was stronger than they were at 100
    That's actually pretty interesting. 

People think that some people can just brush off anything. when something as simple as holding the door open actually bothers them. 

Context is pretty important. And having a loved one joke about something is very different to someone else pointing it out.
        Thats something alot of people do too. Shit Ive had to stop myself from holding open doors for people at university since its not the same vibe as my hometown. 
            I just hold the door for everybody. If that offends anyone (and it has) that's their personal issue not mine. Sorry for being courteous.
    I mean holding a door open isn't exactly a feat of strength. It's just polite to hold the door even to non disabled people.
    Missing a leg and just wanna add some input into this:

We laugh about it because honestly, you have to. That sounds much, much sadder than it is, but it's simply that your choices are to move on or piss and moan about and let it define you. You meet so many disabled people laughing it off *because* it's like wtf do you want them to do, be a pussy-ass little bitch about the topic their entire lives? What a miserable existence that'd be. *Of course* we laugh it off; you would too, unless you prefer writing poems about the darkness consuming your tortured soul.

On the topic of door-holding and the like, I never got that one or why it upsets some disabled people....until recently. Recent years my prosthetic has become something I can't wear. I have some kind of pain that kicks in after 2-3 hours of wearing it. It's not specific to any one prosthetic and clearly lies within my body. We suspect nerve pains but unfortunately that's hard to prove and to treat in my case. Anyways, I've been on crutches instead. I'm perfectly fine with this and in some ways feel faster/more nimble on crutches since that's a lot of weight no longer hanging onto my leg. (or what I have of one)

This is the thing: I feel more disabled socially and financially than anything else. Tell me to do something, I'll do it. Pretty much the only time I'll say "I can't" is if you ask me to beat someone in a running race, in which case I'll say "wtf asshole," but I'd simultaneously point out honestly, how important is it to be able to run fast in your day-to-day life? (and keyword *run.* I can move fast too, but it's rare you actually have to run somewhere) Anything that you need to do daily...? Man I live alone. I emigrated to another country on my own. I clearly don't have to worry about dependency on anyone or not being able to do something, so as a practical limitation...? It isn't. Depending on the situation, it can be an advantage (countries that offer workplace benefits for X % of disabled workers) or disadvantage. (USA gonna fuck your ass cause how dare you have a disability, gimme your money)

Financial is something that affects me if I'm in the USA, but luckily I'm a dual citizen and can dodge that bullet, yay. 

Socially...? It has become blatantly obvious to me that I am perceived as weaker now that I use crutches instead of my prosthetic. A part of it *can* be pretty miserable, because it's this feeling that no matter what you do, you will not be recognized for it. This is annoying because it eats at you and makes you question if those opportunities that passed you by (new love interest, new job opportunity, whatever) actually passed you by because you underachieved or because someone *perceived* you wouldn't be good enough. It's simply the frustration with not knowing, but also being able to compare something like prosthetic vs. crutches and seeing a clear difference. Constantly using it as an excuse for failures is toxic and a no-go, so the only option is to get even better, but that doesn't make it any less bitter when something doesn't feel deserved.

Speaking for my surroundings for example, I know I walk more than 90% of my collegues and also seem to be stronger (I mean wtf my hands are now my feet too, effectively) than most, but if I and someone I know were to both slip on a wet floor in a supermarket, he might get stared at or laughed at while I'm gonna get this huge pity party coming to make sure I don't need to go to the hospital. Hate it. It's not that I don't appreciate the concern, but rather what gets unintentionally conveyed during those moments is "I don't view you as an equal and I view you as less capable. (even though I just watched you carrying four shopping bags through the store on crutches)"

So yeah, at the end of the day I don't think it's much to do with needing to prove strength or anything, but rather just an ongoing lament that even if **you** personally can overcome your disability, loads of people will never, ever ever recognize this and they will view you as less for it by default. 

My advice for people not wanting to accidently do this? If you encounter a disabled guy going to a door or whatever, just judge if it looks like he wants/expects/is waiting on the help or not. They're not gonna be afraid to tell you they want the help if they do. If they're pausing at the door or something or they seem to slow down as their body language turns towards others, sure. If you JUST watched that guy open two doors after another with no problem, he's turning to leave after buying his stuff, and now you're like "OH HERE LET ME GET OUT FROM BEHIND THIS COUNTER TO HELP YOU, PLEASE WAIT SIR" then it's like 'tf are you blind? 
    A buddy of mine got his legs blown off in Afghanistan and he wears shirts that say all kinda crazy shit. He wore one to the reunion that says ‚ÄúHave you seen my legs?‚Äù He‚Äôs got one with like a frantic looking face on it that says ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt find my legs.‚Äù My favorite one though, it says ‚ÄúSpring Break 2010‚Äù (he got blown up April 2010) in like real vibrant rainbow wavy colors and there‚Äôs an all white picture of an amputee holding his legs up behind it. He‚Äôs awesome. 
    My husband is missing part of a finger and we make stump jokes about it all the time. We wouldn't go up to a rando amputee and start clowning them though.
    i get him being annoyed by it but at the same time its really hard to know whats the right thing to do, either im the asshole who wont hold a door for a disabled person or im the asshole who thinks he cant do it himself
        This is true. The gesture is generally good, but since he could do it well, he liked to. It's a weird slope
    Tell your friend that ppl often hold doors just to be polite and it has nothing to do with his disability.
    Same thing happened for my good friend a little while after his dad passed, he started making dead dad jokes, he loved his dad but it was just for shock value and to fuck with people after a while I got used to it but at first I was like fuckkkk that's dark man and didn't really know what to say.
In my experience, the majority of people who get offended by certain terms or phrases are people who aren't even affiliated with those terms or phrases.
TIL.

that must be why the game doesn't auto end when you've got 3 ppl knocked down.
    Only on yellow knockdown shield though.
It takes a really long time to use though
Because reddit is filled with a LOT of socially awkward people who see cringe everywhere because it is usually them.
The disabled guy didn't get offended so someone has to get offended for him. 
Not really cringe. Not like you knew. 
Improvise. Adapt. Overcome.

Except unironically.
    ‚ÄúGamers‚Äù
    This but unironically 
Oh for sure, he‚Äôs got more than me anyway :D gg
Same, haven't gotten a kill yet, at this point I'm gonna see how high I can get in rank before that happens. I'm rank 7 right now üòÅ
    Hahaha same and it's tragic. I'm at level 9 right now with 0 kills. It's very disheartening but I just keep hoping I'll get better someday.
        Don't give up, you'll get there! BR can be really rough at first, especially against seasoned players of the genre.
You realise that's because most console shooters have some degree of auto-aim with controllers right?
    No thats not the reason. Yes I realize many games have that but I am not talking about that.

A controller is not a very good tool to aim. However I had only controllers as a kid and are really used to it. I can aim pretty good with a controler. If I would play against a clone of me who would have a mouse I would most likely win with the mouse. But I am only playing against people who also have controllers and as far as controller aim goes I would consider myself pretty good.

A mouse gives you a way higher skill sceiling than a controller. I am not really good at aiming with a mouse but if you can do this you are way better than any controller user ever could be. Therefore I get way more shit on in computer games. 

That isnt a bad thing at all, I was just pointing out that my mouse aim really isnt good at all - it was pretty okay when I was 13 years old and played counterstrike 1.6 but after that (and a brief source phase) I didnt really played any shooters anymore... now im 28 and I have a real hard time catching up. The game is still super fun tho
Imagine you're painting alongside bob ross. You have your paint brush in your hand. You make wide sweeping strokes to begin the painting. Your whole arm is into it. As the painting comes to a close and you begin on finer details you start to use more of your wrist and fine control of your fingers. It is finally finished. Now take out a fresh canvas. You paint the same thing but this time you have two brushes taped to your thumbs instead. You cant touch the brushes with any of your fingers and cant move the rest of your arm. This is what it's like to play keyboard and mouse vs controller for those with experience. But its okay because everyone on console is limited in the same way too. Cant wait for crossplay when I can start wrecking people's thumb-only paintings.

yw
his loss of arm has nothing to do with the military.
    Well then the military is not responsible as they were not the cause of the accident.

Edit: This sounds more close minded than I meant. The government should take care of him and im sure they do somewhat through disability.
[deleted]
he's obviously getting proper care from the government and is not homeless considering he's streaming games
Yikes
None of them do? Man you're cynical. 
Why? 
    [deleted]
Sorry to hurt your feelings, but mainstream American society already treats veterans like flawless heroes.  This isn't debatable,  it's simple recognition of reality.

And considering America hasn't had a justified conflict in decades, its frankly ridiculous.

You right. Edited. I thought I saw a high up-voted link to his Twitch, might have been another post.

Someone with clout post an easy link to his Twitch. Haha.

"[Twitch.tv/ToeYouUp](https://Twitch.tv/ToeYouUp)'

;)

&#x200B;
Oh yes... You are right. It's def level 4 - Gold.
Thanks for catching that. ;)
i hate both of you
Irony also applies to his teammate being disabled, so no, not obvious. 
    Oh wow. Okay.
        Is there a reason you're argumentative?

The situation would be ironic if they were attempting to insult the last player for their poor aim. IE, they must be disabled because they couldn't kill us.
He is missing an arm but he doesn‚Äôt seem disabled. Love it
[deleted]
    Honestly I thought he was reacting when he stopped leaning back
        A legless dude once told us he had a great relationship with his brother because his brother didn't treat his disability as this awkward taboo thing. 

His brother cracks legless jokes, occasionally puts stuff out of reach just to fuck with him. True love?
            I don't think there's a golden rule for situations like this. They require empathy on the part of both sides - one, to understand the other's current acceptance of what is being discussed; two, to know the limit between a joke and hurting the person.

I think yeah, his brother is showing true love.  Fucking with your siblings is a time-honored tradition.
            I mean between good friends I doubt that kind of stuff is off limits, if those were his friends I bet one of them made a joke about the enemy playing with one arm. 
    I think we all get that he meant downed. It's still funny.
        I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs not cringy and not awkward at all. 

Coincidentally funny? Yeah I‚Äôm not gonna try to claim it isn‚Äôt funny by coincidence. 

It‚Äôs definitely not irony tho. 
            True. A lot of people do seem to think the guy genuinely reacted to the word disabled. 
I got the gold shield once but already after my team disconnected, so no self revive for me.
    I really thought it would let me revive even with no team. Was disappointed to find that out
Im disabled and idc if people say shit like that lol

Also looks like he is on PS4, does the adaptive work on any console like that? That would be pretty damn awesome.
    I believe so, and if not, we can find a solution.
        We have the technology 
            This ain‚Äôt 1999!
                https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/a2bxjj/video_how_to_use_the_xbox_adaptive_controller_on/
                But man, I wish it was. 
        I believe the adaptive controller is all hardware based, so if you get a converter to use Xbox controllers on PS4 and vice versa, you can set it up to work.
Possibly, but I don‚Äôt think so. It‚Äôs technically not an Xbox product. I‚Äôd assume it‚Äôs the same as buying one of the Sony macros to use on Xbox 
    Ahh i see
        Yep :)
    But it has an Xbox button on it?
        ‚ÄòTechnically‚Äô Sony aren‚Äôt very fond of using other products with theirs.
            Hey at least headphones work easily on their systems now, unlike the mess that was using a headset with ps3s. My PC Cloud II can easily plug in and out of my ps4 
                What was the issue with headsets on ps3? For me it worked fine.
            I think in this case the PR blowback of not allowing it would be severe enough for them to allow it.
Imagine the internet rage if Xbox said something like "we wanted to let the disabled PS4 players use it too but Sony declined"
    Yikes. That would be a nightmare for sony. Never thought of it like that
        Sony isn't allowing it to work out of the box just yet. Sony being Sony =/
No it‚Äôs a Microsoft controller and not specific to Xbox, works on all platforms the same way usb controllers can work on pc. 
it's not technically an xbox product. It's more like using a sony headset that can work with any platform
Not to mention it'd look like a real dick move to block it, not that Japanese companies give a shit about what westerners think
I‚Äôm about 80% sure it is. Their main focus was to make it accessible to anyone regardless of what they play on so I‚Äôm assuming it was a priority. If not then it‚Äôs just Sony being selfish 
    Unfortunately at the moment it is not officially compatible with the PS4. Microsoft does want it compatible with every platform and it is a really cool product :)

There are work arounds though!

https://youtu.be/p3p1RTpW4SI
        Just when you think Sony's greed finally reached its limit. They force you to use work arounds for adaptive controllers. They have no souls.
            Are you sure Sony is at fault here? 
                Sony's track record doesn't really merit the benefit of the doubt.
                    I‚Äôm not familiar with their track record. What have they done?
                no they don't, but we have to be angry at someone damn it!
    Their track record isn't the best but it's kinda hard to refuse something like this. Would have been a huge media backfire that would have force them to do it anyway.
        That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs going to happen. Doesn‚Äôt matter if Sony refuse to allow Microsoft products on their services, this is about allowing anyone to game no matter who they are. 
Did not know that, that‚Äôs pretty cool. 
Can't do analogue input on PS4 though, because it detects it as a generic directinput controller
That's very cool of ms to do  I thought it was just Xbox and was like that's awesome sucks for everyone else though

He‚Äôd be able to for example put all buttons in his hand along with movement stick and ADS button and maybe leave the aim stick and trigger to his feet along with maybe the ping button and he can sit comfortably.
    That would be really cool. That has got to be super uncomfortable. 
        How uncomfortable do you think it would be? https://youtu.be/_YISTzpLXCY 
            I still tear up a little when i hear the father say "he's not different when he plays"

I'm so dissappointed in myself for laughing at this... Much respect to this guy but I can't help it
    I‚Äôm sure if he‚Äôs on twitch he has a decent humor about it
        Oh I'm sure he does, just doesn't mean I'm not a terrible human being haha
            You're not a terrible human. Shit's funny. I've never met an amputee that didn't already have a million jokes of their own about their disability. I'm a below knee amputee and my first name just happens to rhyme with "peg leg". Guess how I introduce myself to people. 
    He'd probably laugh with you. That's part of how people deal with trouble - if you let your ailments define you, it just holds you down.  You've got to take the hand you're dealt and move forward. 

ToeYouUp, if you see this - thank you for your service. I hope to see you in Apex, mate. 
        hehe "hand youre dealt"
            I uh... Whoops. 
That reminds me of that one streamer that was in a wheelchair and then just stood up on accident.
    That's the thing everyone can get up out of a wheelchair,  it just needs to be on accident.
or my axe 
    [deleted]
        Or Patrick 
        More like combat able amirite??
It's detected as a generic controller though, so no analogue input
With some workarounds ya. Sony hasn't officially allowed their stuff to connect with it out the box. 
Get him a mouse with a shit load of buttons, they exist
I could never see enemies in any Battlefield game, so yeah your eyes must be used to that. 
Literally the one good thing about BFV's visibility

Other games: visibility is bad

BFV gang: *laughs in superhuman sight*
Wot? I haven't noticed that at all. Did it come out in an update in the last 24 hours?
    No. 
        As far as I'm aware, enemies only glow once you've pegged their shields once.  Otherwise, they don't glow at all.  I've had a really difficult time distinguishing enemies when I first started playing, but once you start looking for movement instead it become easier.
That's actually pretty interesting. 

People think that some people can just brush off anything. when something as simple as holding the door open actually bothers them.

Yikes. That would be a nightmare for sony. Never thought of it like that
    Sony isn't allowing it to work out of the box just yet. Sony being Sony =/
Unfortunately at the moment it is not officially compatible with the PS4. Microsoft does want it compatible with every platform and it is a really cool product :)

There are work arounds though!

    Just when you think Sony's greed finally reached its limit. They force you to use work arounds for adaptive controllers. They have no souls.
        Are you sure Sony is at fault here? 
            Sony's track record doesn't really merit the benefit of the doubt.
                I‚Äôm not familiar with their track record. What have they done?
            no they don't, but we have to be angry at someone damn it!
Their track record isn't the best but it's kinda hard to refuse something like this. Would have been a huge media backfire that would have force them to do it anyway.
    That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs going to happen. Doesn‚Äôt matter if Sony refuse to allow Microsoft products on their services, this is about allowing anyone to game no matter who they are. 
That would be really cool. That has got to be super uncomfortable. 
    How uncomfortable do you think it would be? https://youtu.be/_YISTzpLXCY 
        I still tear up a little when i hear the father say "he's not different when he plays"
        I was talking about how my leg falls asleep when i sit like that for like 10 minutes
I‚Äôm sure if he‚Äôs on twitch he has a decent humor about it
    Oh I'm sure he does, just doesn't mean I'm not a terrible human being haha
        You're not a terrible human. Shit's funny. I've never met an amputee that didn't already have a million jokes of their own about their disability. I'm a below knee amputee and my first name just happens to rhyme with "peg leg". Guess how I introduce myself to people. 
He'd probably laugh with you. That's part of how people deal with trouble - if you let your ailments define you, it just holds you down.  You've got to take the hand you're dealt and move forward. 

ToeYouUp, if you see this - thank you for your service. I hope to see you in Apex, mate. 
    hehe "hand youre dealt"
        I uh... Whoops. 
That's the thing everyone can get up out of a wheelchair,  it just needs to be on accident.

No. 
    As far as I'm aware, enemies only glow once you've pegged their shields once.  Otherwise, they don't glow at all.  I've had a really difficult time distinguishing enemies when I first started playing, but once you start looking for movement instead it become easier.
Thats something alot of people do too. Shit Ive had to stop myself from holding open doors for people at university since its not the same vibe as my hometown. 
    I just hold the door for everybody. If that offends anyone (and it has) that's their personal issue not mine. Sorry for being courteous.
This is true. The gesture is generally good, but since he could do it well, he liked to. It's a weird slope
Don't give up, you'll get there! BR can be really rough at first, especially against seasoned players of the genre.
Is there a reason you're argumentative?

The situation would be ironic if they were attempting to insult the last player for their poor aim. IE, they must be disabled because they couldn't kill us.
A legless dude once told us he had a great relationship with his brother because his brother didn't treat his disability as this awkward taboo thing. 

His brother cracks legless jokes, occasionally puts stuff out of reach just to fuck with him. True love?
    I don't think there's a golden rule for situations like this. They require empathy on the part of both sides - one, to understand the other's current acceptance of what is being discussed; two, to know the limit between a joke and hurting the person.

I think yeah, his brother is showing true love.  Fucking with your siblings is a time-honored tradition.
    I mean between good friends I doubt that kind of stuff is off limits, if those were his friends I bet one of them made a joke about the enemy playing with one arm. 
I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs not cringy and not awkward at all. 

Coincidentally funny? Yeah I‚Äôm not gonna try to claim it isn‚Äôt funny by coincidence. 

It‚Äôs definitely not irony tho. 
    True. A lot of people do seem to think the guy genuinely reacted to the word disabled. 
Oh no üò∞üòûüòû

        But man, I wish it was. 
I believe the adaptive controller is all hardware based, so if you get a converter to use Xbox controllers on PS4 and vice versa, you can set it up to work.
Yep :)
‚ÄòTechnically‚Äô Sony aren‚Äôt very fond of using other products with theirs.
    Hey at least headphones work easily on their systems now, unlike the mess that was using a headset with ps3s. My PC Cloud II can easily plug in and out of my ps4 
        What was the issue with headsets on ps3? For me it worked fine.
