[[Mega Crit issues statement on Unity pricing change]]





Oh these are the Slay the Spire guys, I had no idea they were even doing more stuff so that’s nice to know.
    They recently hired a community manager so I figured they were working on something, and a while back they hired an artist who previously worked on Dicey Dungeons. I believe they have stated they aren't making a sequel, but that's about all we know.

I expect it's a bit further away now. May have to buy slay the spire on yet another platform to help em out.
        What platform do you not have it on? Imagine a port to those stupid refrigerators with the screens. Lol
            I've always wanted to play games on Android Auto, personally
                "Hey siri. Buy more grandmas in cookie clicker."
            StS is the new Doom. Soon enough we'll see people doing A20 streaks on oscilloscopes and tamagotchis
        The madlads actually made their first game in libgdx out of everything available, so honestly, I can believe they wouldn't take THAT long to get their stuff onto a new engine.
        > May have to buy slay the spire on yet another platform to help em out.

Just remember to not install the game :)
            I know you're joking, but Slay the Spire is not made in Unity.
                Ah, you're correct. I forgot that part immediately after reading it. Thanks!
That comment at the end is fucking fantastic. I can't say I've ever seen a statement like that before.
    Made me laugh out loud.

No point making vague statements. Tell everyone how you feel.
    You only get one first and they made it count.
    Only fitting for the Pandora's box that unity opened with their policy. Even if they revert the fact that they did it once will never disappear. Every halfway successful dev using unity in the future will hunt them down to have personalised contracts they can't retroactively change or seriously invest in alternatives.

It's sad. The availability of ready made game engines has been such a massive move forward for gaming as a whole. 15 years ago making games was a massive undertaking requiring hundreds of thousands of dollars for an engine licence or a team of specialised programmers to make your own.
    Yeah this is a professional company statement and then it ends like some rant Reddit comment lol.
        They aren't a giant publisher. These companies are made up of passionate people that pour countless hours of energy into a product that we all can enjoy.

Not every statement has to be some soulless litigation proof memorandum.
            I know that's why it's funny? They make it look like a PR statement and then end up with a fuck lol
                Ah, I thought you were trying to say the opposite.
This whole thing really reminds me to the DnD OGL situation that happened at the beginning of the year. Let's hope this ends with the community winning as well.

        I don't think they will back-pedal either, but they'll have to compromise somehow with how negative the reaction has been to the announcement. Not to mention it's not a few indie devs they're affecting here, motherfucking League of Legends use Unity, for example, how Unity is going through with this without a bunch of legal teams burning their ass is beyond me
            Genshin Impact, Marvel Snap, and Pokemon Go all run on Unity too, and I dunno who in their right mind would want to take on Hoyoverse, Disney, and Nintendo all at the same time.
                Yeah, they're fucked. This is going to be hilarious.
                    I'm pretty sure Microsoft is on the list too. I think they claimed that fee's will be charged to the distributors, so unity games on GamePass. Or Microsoft just pulls Unity based games from their catalog, but time will tell.
                        
>I think they claimed that fee's will be charged to the distributors

Which is fucking hysterical, because that means they're also going to try to charge Valve, Epic, EA, CDPR, Sony, Nintendo and a variety other storefronts as well. None of whom have contracts with them. They apparently *want* to be sued by everyone under the sun.

I don't think they even consulted a lawyer, this is so blatantly illegal I'm shocked that they thought this was a good idea.
                            Well consider the CEO was trh same EA guy who had bright ideas such as making the player pay money to repair their in-game car and generally made EA look like the greediest, worst gaming company and it starts making sense.

Why a clown like that is still in such a high ranked highly paid position is still baffling
                                >Why a clown like that is still in such a high ranked highly paid position is still baffling

He apparently sold off stock like a week or two ago before dropping this. He might end up being investigated by financial regulators at the end of this lol.
                                    Bet he's shorting the stock too, or having someone else do it on his behalf.
                                > Why a clown like that is still in such a high ranked highly paid position is still baffling

Rich people have benefits us lowly workers don't have, including the advantage of failing your way upwards.
                            Yeah, when devs started asking Unity folks how things like gamepass would work with this, the response they got from management was basically "Well we're going to have to sit down and have some discussions with the subscription services about it."

I didn't go to business school, so maybe I'm way off base here, but maybe you should've had those conversations and figured all of this out with the relevant parties before you announce a major change that you say is going to go into effect 4 months from now. 

Microsoft/Valve/Epic/Sony/Apple/Nintendo/etc. are all going to tell Unity to go pound sand if asked to cough up a payment per install. They don't want to have to track that stuff for a third party company, and at this point, there's no way any of them are going to want to wade into this mess on Unity's side.
                                Great point. Did they really think the platform holders would be all chill with this?
                        Microsoft owns Obsidian now I think, who made Pillars of Eternity 1 & 2 with Unity.
                            The Ori games are Unity as well, perhaps even the new game that Moon Studios is working on?

I think Hearthstone is Unity as well? So ActiBlizz also in the boat
                Don't forget Microsoft, EA, and Sony. Plus you can probably include Valve, Apple, and Google, as they're the ones distributing the games and thus the ones that somehow need to track unique installs.
                You think they don't know this? This is exactly the companies they are going for, the indies are just a nice extra. Unity also has a lot of money, and at some point more money doesn't help you in legal battles. Courts have to decide this, although I have high hopes that this won't fly in europe at all.
                All of them with get special exclusive deals that eliminate the fees
            All of Hoyoverse's popular games use Unity, as well. And they have enough fuck you money to get into a massive legal battle over this if they wanted.
                And that money will presumably get backup from the plumber's ninjas and the Mouse's legal team. All Unity has done here is given everyone else a target, ironically causing unity in the process.
            Wild Rift you mean? I think League on PC runs a variation of some big rigs engine or some shit.
            > I don't think they will back-pedal either,

They already did a little bit. Mostly about re-installs. But most people didn't hear about it because they didn't update their official pages on this and as Mega Crit mentioned, the trust has already been broken.
        Sadly not many great alternatives.
            Unreal has always been a strong contender, and I've heard good things about Godot as well. Honestly Godot might be the biggest winner coming out of all this.
                People also sleep on Game Maker. Games like Hotline Miami, Hyper Light Drifter, and Undertale were made with it. It's a *very* capable engine if smaller scale, 2D stuff is what a dev team is going for.
                Godot doesn't have real console support without doing it yourself completely which is why it's not viable for a lot of smaller devs. Unreal is more high end option that is not always suitable for smaller teams.
        >I see no reason why any indie dev would go near Unity even if they back-pedalled completely  

If you are small indie dev (basically solo) and arent trying to make f2p game. There is no reason why not. Most games dont earn even close that much money. Currently learning about Unity myself, wouldnt mind paying 20% from 200k IF i would hit it big (but most likely will not happen).
            It's not 20%. That would be steep, but within the realms of reason. Or at least the realms of, well, reality.

It's $0.20 per install. Not per sale, per *install*. There are so many problems with tacking it to installs rather than sales that it's difficult to fully get it across. Just for starters though, imagine someone bought your game, and then paid for a botnet to install said game on 10,000 devices. Now imagine they bought your cheap game 100 times and installed on each device 100 times.

Someone spent maybe a grand at most on a botnet and 100 copies of your game, and now you owe $200,000 to Unity. As a small indie dev, you're probably bankrupt and whatever internet troll you pissed off is laughing his ass off.

And this is assuming that Unity somehow manages to put together a decent enough install detection system that means you need to actually buy the game and have a botnet to do this. More realistically, their methods for detecting installs will by shoddy, and one guy who bought your game and doesn't care for it much might be able to spoof thousands of installs a day on their computer with a simple VPN and a script.
                >It's $0.20 per install. Not per sale, per install.  

I know, I just went with worst assumption in mind (basically sale for 1 game for 1$). Unity said, that they wouldnt make pay for re-install (for same game) AND that they would check for bad actors (how the hell, they will do that, that is a very fucking good question).  

>And this is assuming that Unity somehow manages to put together a decent enough install detection system that means you need to actually buy the game and have a botnet to do this.  

Yes, would love to see how they will implement this.  
I can see this being fine, if using Steam (or any of big launchers), but will see. Either way this is a big L for Unity and its community.
                    > Unity said, that they wouldnt make pay for re-install

You'd still need to pay per device though. If someone buys your $1 game and installs it on their PC, their laptop, their phone, their work PC, and their friend's PC, suddenly you owe Unity 100% of that sale. Then they get a new PC and a new phone a year later and suddenly you're losing money on each game.
                        >If someone buys your $1 game and installs it on their PC, their laptop, their phone, their work PC, and their friend's PC, suddenly you owe Unity 100% of that sale.  

Yeap, that is the super bad scenario :( Thats why waiting for more info. But it still would require those 200k profit and 200k installs. So at worst, can stop selling game when you get close to 200k sales (if sale is 1$).  
This will hit mobile, f2p markets the most.
            > Currently learning about Unity myself, wouldnt mind paying 20% from 200k IF i would hit it big

  Ok bro, except you probably wont. Stop simping for unity...
                Mate, I literally said that I most likely wouldnt.  
I am just saying that if you are solo dev then these changes dont matter for more than 90% of users. Rarely you will see solo dev with 200k in revenue and 200k installs in a year.
            Even if this particular change wouldn't affect you, what would stop Unity from changing the terms again? They have shown that they are willing to fuck their users over.
        There's no way they don't backpedal, they're angering some of the major players with this BS, and this ensures all short and long term revenue dries up since nobody wants to make games under these harsh terms.
    This is way worse than that. And that's saying a lot, because WotC shot themselves in the foot real hard with their version of this.
    And the Reddit API fees that killed 3rd party apps just two months ago...

I use Unity. I play D&D. I used a 3rd party Reddit app. Been a rough year for me.
    What happened with dnd?
        The original license meant people could use the mechanics of D&D to make their own games and settings. It also allowed people to make money from the games they created with their new settings/games. This is how the first version of pathfinder came about.

They were going to change the license to retroactively claim the rights to any content created on the old terms. This would allow WotC to use it however they wanted without permission or payment. Also they wanted to start making companies using the ogl hand over a large percentage of any money made. Not profit just revenue.

They were basically trying to put their competitors out of business and seize control of the IPs they created. I believe that Wizards backed down completely and put the original OGL in a creative commons license in the end.
        I want to expand the fantastic answer given by /u/Ok-Discount3131 : 

In the aftermath, the publisher of the competing tabletop system Pathfinder (which basically has its roots in DnD 3e, and thus is also considered at least partly to be OGL content) decided on the radical step of remastering the current second edition of the game to not include **any** content under the OGL anymore.

That means they will remove monsters, races even names of magic spells that come even close to what Wizards made. (they'll replace them with their own versions)

This is because they have no choice - Wizards demonstrated that they are a bad actor here and can never be trusted anymore. The same thing will happen with Unity: **the trust is permanently broken** and you absolutely can't build your own business on trusting them anymore.
            Worth also adding on top of this, they made their own ogl equivalent in response, [ORC](https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sico?). They made sure to make it completely irrevocable.
    It's wall street cashing in on everything with short sighted money grabs. the market get turbulent, and none of them actually has a fucking clue on how to create value, so they will ostracize the bulk of their customers as they wring the money they need for the next quarter out of the couple who are slow to leave. then everything folds, they write off the losses over the next 30 years and look for the next pump and dump.
The Slay the Spire folks are working on a new game? Damn, I'll have to keep an eye out for that one because Slay the Spire is fantastic.
    god, I'm convinced slay the spire is a perfect game
        It's a top 3 roguelite for sure.
            isaac, spelunky, and spire are the holy trinity for me.
                FTL too
                    FTL will always be number one in my heart
                        For as much as I love FTL I sure am terrible at it.
                            I think it's one of the hardest roguelikes without being unfun, theres a lot going on in it, both mechanically and in decision making.
                            I thought being terrible at it was the point. Are you telling me people are good at it? Unthinkable.

Oh, my crew got spaced again.
                            Use pause a lot more, for example pause before missle impact and turn on cloak
                        I remember the first time I played FTL. I downloaded it at like 7 PM and figured I would play for a couple of hours and call it a night. When I lifted my head from the game it was 4 AM.
                    I unfortunately find the end game of FTL painfully unsatisfying and restrictive. The perfect game is a heavily modded FTL where the player's power level outscales the original game by degrees, and has challenges to match.

Of course the best of those also tell you the final challenges ahead of time, and Oh Hey, that's a Slay the Spire thing. Game so good it fixes other good games.
                    What about Streets of Rouge?
                No dead cells?! Your subjective opinion is wrong!
                    Sorry /u/DeadCellsTop5 the best I can do is 6th place
                        Wrong! Lol. I actually have dead cells as my #4 game on my top 25 all-time list. I fucking love that game. I've got Slay the Spire at #9 on the same list, so I fucking love that game too.
                            Would you share your top 25 list? I’m curious. Thanks

My rule is only one game per series is allowed, otherwise it's too repetitive with multiple from the same franchise. It's also always changing. This is where I'm at now, though. Not a big RPG guy, nor a Nintendo guy.
                                    Your lack of Metal Gear Solid representation is disturbing
                    Personally I'd like it more if it forced the player to react to builds more, react to rng. Even with all items unlocked it's not too hard to end up at similar setups in back to back runs, especially with how powerful shops are, let alone with Wish. And the boring stat system ensures you've already committed to a stat before the end of the first level. It is great fun to get in the zone and not drop balanced blade stacks throughout an entire biome, and bosses can be fun in the Goldilocks zone between the struggle bus and instantly vaporizing them with things like baseball bat or half of tactics.

My favorite roguelite currently is Against the Storm by contrast, where playing at a high level is defined by how well you react to the hand you're dealt. StS is also like this at a high level, though some archetypes become near impossible to build past a15.

Edit: To summarize, Dead Cells is a fine action 2d platformer, and not a great roguelite for me.
                        I second Against the Storm, it's a mix of a roguelike with the old city builders (Caesar/Pharaoh) where you can actually lose which makes it more appealing than say Two Point Campus where you eventually just win.  Add in the fact that no game feels the same and it's easily one of my picks of this decade.
                            I've tried the Against the Storm demo a couple of times and can't get into it? Which is sad because rougelites and city builders are my two favourite genres. Did it take a while for it to 'click' for you?
                                It took me a few games to get it to click (like ignore house locations etc) but once the difficulty starts ramping up it has a great gameplay loop.  I'd say it's more old school builder (theme hospital,caesar 3) rather than cities skylines as you're building around the disasters/resources rather than making a nice looking city.  I personally have 221 hours in it so far.
                        can you define roguelite for me? feels like we've lost the plot when a city builder is a roguelite.
                            How about:

A game where you perform a series of "runs" where each run has a significant amount of randomness. Each run is challenging and failure/death may frequently end the run unsuccessfully. Often, roguelites have some kind of meta-progression between runs. Roguelites are intended to be played many times, rather than once and done, since a lot of content or progression is only unlocked after multiple runs.

Against the Storm is clearly a roguelite imo.
                                I would also add that each run isn't particularly long. I think for me, most "runs" when learning cap out at 35 minutes or so. Once I am good at them, under 25 or under 20.
                                is tropico a roguelite? randomness, runs, meta progression, gated content.
                                    I don't think tropico has the same level of randomness (you can build any/all the same buildings every time, maps and events are handmade for campaign mode) nor is failure/death a significant threat. There also is no progression if you fail. It's just a regular campaign game. Frequent failure is a core part of the experience of roguelites.
                            I would define a roguelite as: short run/round/map-focused gameplay, start from scratch each run, high variance in equipment/cards/enemies/objectives/strategy each run, after each run you have meta progression for the next run. Against the storm and slay the spire ticks all these boxes.
                            Against the Storm is undoubtedly a roguelite haha, I don't care to quibble about this. It's a roguelite first, the towns you build are extremely temporary in nature, the city-building nature plays second fiddle to the fact that all your buildings and decisions are meant to win the map, not raise a mighty city or empire.
                    Can't forget Hades
                    Always feel like I'm taking crazy pills because I did not like Dead Cells at all. I play tons of roguelites and Dead Cells would be towards the bottom of the rankings. I found nothing about the game engaging.
                        Boy, you crazy! Nah, it's all personal opinion, so it doesn't matter. I find the combat so incredibly satisfying. It's quick, it's snappy, it's predictable. I LOVE the dodge roll and how your can dodge cancel out of nearly any animation. I honestly think it's the best 2D action game out there because the combat is damn near perfect. Then the biomes are all distinct with their own enemy types and the ng+ modes add so much to an already stellar game. Then throw in all of the build possibilities with all the weapons and the multiple branching pathways and it's like roguelite heaven for me.
                            See that's the weird thing, my biggest complaint is that I didn't like the combat. Maybe if I unlocked more stuff I would have enjoyed it more - that is kind of a common gripe with roguelites. But yeah the combat from the handful of hours I played just bored me.
                                Man, that's crazy to me. That combat is incredible. Pretty much every review praises it. I've never seen anyone complain about the combat before. You should give it another shot, or at least watch some gameplay from a streamer or someone deeper in the game. The weapon variety is insane too.
                                    The weapon variety at least at the start of the game seemed really limited. And maybe I just don't actually like 2d action combat lol.
                    No Dead Cells and no Hades. 

Hades, Dead Cells and Slay the Spire is the trinity of roguelikes IMO. FTL if it's a quatuor
                Enter the Gungeon is clearly the best and it's not even close. This discussion make me realise how many amazing roguelites there are, wow!
                    I was going to say the same! Enter the Gungeon on a hypothetical "best roguelite games" list would be the top if not real close to it. The game is just so damn charming on top of some highly addicting gameplay.
                        I love the game but it’s too f’ing hard for me. Took me 70 hrs to beat the Dragun and that was with a Sir Junkan lucky but cheesy strat. It was just too hard to get enough time on the lower levels. I didn’t put serious time after the large expansion/patch they did but heard it got balanced a bit smoother.

Edit: also played it on Switch which may have had something to do with it. I was shocked at how much better a Hades player I was on a 144 hz monitor at high res.
                And Monster Train, I think the only card roguelite I really liked. There is Erannorth Chronicles but that one is more sandbox than roguelite.
                Noita is #1 for me but inno what 2 and 3 are
                Risk of Rain 2
        There are some games I have more fun with, but I genuinely think StS is a perfectly designed game. It's got insane depth at higher levels while not bogging everything down. It's just so clean.
            Something that I think STS got right is how difficult it is to play defensively. I like Pirates Outlaws and Dawncaster more than STS, but both of those games made defending easier. The problem is that defensive strats are significantly easier than offensive ones; if you take one big hit, you have to expend resources to recover that could be spent elsewhere. If your deck is defensive and kills opponent gradually without taking damage, you can spend your resources on something else, adding up significantly over the course of a run.
        I've played a ton of similar games and none of them have StS's replay value. They all lack it's sheer fun factor, even if they have more depth to them. I've gotten A20 with all the characters and I still load it up here and there.
            Have you beaten the heart with all 4 though? That shit can make a man lose his damn mind lol
                Baalorlord (one of the top StS players) said something along the lines of A10 Heart being harder than A20 without Heart. I'm not sure how much I agree with it but it's definitely a massive step up to fight the Heart on any ascension. It's a very befitting boss as the ultimate test of your deck.
                    Heart is just ridiculous. You can have a deck that absolutely crushes everything, including the boss before the heart, only to get wiped by the heart in 3 turns. It can be very deflating. Still haven't beaten it with the watcher
                        Watcher is a tricky character to play but once you get the hang of her you'll realize she's way stronger than the initial three. She came later and didn't get quite as much balancing, to the point people say she's like a fan made character. The most consistent way to play her is to stance dance, to the point if all you're doing is taking absolutely no cards in Act 1 except Talk to the Hand, Mental Fortress, Tantrum (if you haven't upgraded Eruption yet), 1 Inner Peace or Fear No Evil, and Rushdown and you'll build an infinite which can brute force a win in a small number of attempts.
                            I once watched Jorbs go unreasonably far in a Watcher A20 run taking zero cards to make a point. The biggest mistake people make with Watcher is not realizing how strong her starting deck is and adding a bunch of junk to it.
                            Watcher being the strongest character is exactly what leads to Watcher runs primarily fizzling at the Heart battle.

Even infinites can fail against heart if you don't find passive block generation as you are forced to tank a LOT of damage across the first three turns no matter what.
                            I don't think it's that they didn't balance it as much, it's that her main mechanic of Wrath is one of these things where it's either broken or it feels very bad and not that fun, and they'd rather have Watcher be fun for the average player even if she ends up broken for A20 players.
                        lifecoach1981 is currently doing 50 watcher wins in a row on twitch, sitting on 21 right now. maybe you can learn some tricks there (asc 20 ofc) - but be warned, some runs take 8 hours..
                            Ages ago when he was a Hearthstone pro he was called "ropecoach" because he always used the maximum turn time to think (the ending countdown is visualized by a rope that burns across the screen)

Looks like some things never change...
                                People still meme about him in Hearthstone even though he hasn't been playing the game for like 5 years.
                            Is he beating the heart every time? I've beaten the game with the watcher, just not the heart
                                Yes, a win = ASC20 including heart. Is at 22 in a row now, just finished his latest run an hour ago :)
                        Heart isn't the biggest problem. The problem is the last path towards it. Starts with a resting site which is useless there in terms of healing because you'll heal all the way after the boss anyway. So you can either upgrade one card or if you're lucky and have the relics either get another relic or get more HP. All of these are mostly useless there. Then a merchant, then that Miniboss with the two attacking sides. Those two are already massively dangerous and I mostly go out of that fight with half health. And with that sliver to survive the heart is almost impossible. Would be a whole lot easier if the resting site came after the miniboss.
                        I beat the very first heart fight i ever did with the silent, had that relic that revives with 50% HP and forgot about it, also had Fairy in a bottle lol, literally died twice to win, crazy fight.

I beat the boss before the heart in like 4 turns.

It was a Bullet Time, Runic Pyramid run where i would draw 10 cards every turn and Snecko Skull applying like 50 poison per turn, very fun
                        Pro tip: To help beat the Heart with Watcher, "see a Talk to the Hand, take a Talk to the Hand"
                    Eyy, another Baalorlord enjoyer! I kind of agree with him, tbh. I've got to A20 on every character, but I'm only up to A5 with heart kills (so I can't speak to his exact statement about A10 heart, unfortunately). Act 4 requires different tactics than the rest of the game, to some extent, so building a deck to do it all is an extra challenge.
                        What I'm not sure I agree with is how much higher is the jump in difficulty. I'm not sure it's as high as 10 ascensions. That said, he has like 6k more hours than me and the last time I touched A10H was when I was climbing ascensions, so I don't have a good reference to what not fighting the Heart feels like since I always prepared for it.
                            Ahh, gotcha! Yeah, I did a climb to 20 first to adjust to the new mechanics at each level before I went into dedicated heart kills. I got a couple here and there on runs I felt were going well, but now I'm counting it as my win condition to ascend.
                            I've beaten A20H on all 4 characters multiple times and I dropped down to A10 for fun. I am way more successful at A10H than I am at even getting out of act 2 on A20 lol. Maybe I just suck, but I'd guess for me it'd be like A20 is easier than A17H
                Nah, not on A20
            >Even if they have more depth to them

What on earth are you smoking that you think there are multiple other games that have more depth than slay the spire? The level of depth, especially going for the heart on a20 is as deep of a strategy game as there is out there.
            Slay the Spire then becomes stupidly better with Downfall. It's like every single one of the best modders came together to make Slay the Spire 2.

I consider Marisa a base game character too. One of the best designed standalone ones. They actually have some custom logic just for ger cards in Downfall.
                I'll check it out. Never played any mods or anything.
            I've also hit A20 and after struggling for a million years to try and beat it, I just started playing custom games for fun.

Shit reinvirgorated the game for me and I have hundreds of hours. Screwing around in the game is as fun as trying hard IMO.
        it is. there's lots of imitators and they're fun in their own way but StS has that perfect ratio of RNG and consistency that makes it perfect.
        It’s what got my gf hooked on gaming. We play a round before bed almost every night
        It’s a game that fits perfectly that niche between deckbuilding, dungeon crawling, and gambling.

One of the very few games I’ve replayed until the end many times. Currently on my third run to A20 all classes: did it on PC eons ago, Xbox when it hit Game Pass, and on my phone now that it’s on Apple Arcade.
            Is the iOS port any good? The Android one is terrible. Still the same game, but poorly executed. Cards are sticky, so you wind up playing cards you were trying to read if you're not really careful. Not using Save and Quit can result in your run getting deleted entirely when your phone moves STS out of RAM. Etcetera.
                It's pretty good. I run into the sticky card problem sometimes and it's worse on iPhone because sometimes you pull up the notification center screen and it minimizes the game. It's a UX issue.

Other than that, performance wise, it's great. STS never crashed, I've never ran into the save issue, STS never locked my phone. FWIW I have an iPhone 14 Pro, but I think it runs great on older phones, as long as it isn't an iPhone SE or an X.
            What about the heart, though?
                A20 Heart is way too hard. I don’t have the skill to do that. I’ll leave to the pros and streamers. :(
        Its very very good, but I might stop just short of "perfect". There are just enough little things I could imagine being better: difficulty gap between the easist and hardest elites, the extreme difficulty spikes in the A-teens, writhing mass being added to the game.

Its not like you can "just fix it" though. I stopped playing for a few years and after i came back, Silent has Blade Dance buffed and one of the discard cards became uncommon and just those 2 changes basically made it a totally different class. This type of game is insanely hard to develop so the fact its so good is crazy.
        The slow unlock process at the start keeps it from being perfect in my opinion.

I played it years ago and was bored as hell because all my runs were just playing Attack Attack Attack Block Block Block. I think I got to the second boss a few times then just stopped playing because it was so bland.

Wasn't until I got a Steam Deck that I gave it another go, and found that I'd stopped just before I started unlocking some interesting synergies with new cards. Now I'm interested, but I could have been hooked immediately if it actually started this way.


Lot of games seem to want to imitate Binding of Isaac these days, in that they hide most of their content until you've beaten a few runs. But BoI still had a large pool of items even from the very start.
            I found the game Vault of the Void to have a much better take on this, where every single starting deck had no generic "Attack" and "Block" cards, they all had some other effect or nuance, which in some cases were pretty major.
                Sounds interesting, I'll give it a look!
            I tried to get the last rogue unlock several times and each time after completing a run and seeing that I still needed lots of runs I just "nope" and deleted the game...

RNG is pretty wild, and you have close to no way with controlling it. I like roguelites which have some unlocking over time mechanics of rerolling offers or bumping chances of specific buff/card classes. It feels good when you finished the game few times, get some upgrade to force some build and try out different builds, instead here you're forced to play whatever you're getting on each run.
                If you haven't tried Vault of the Void yet, definitely give it a look. I got into it precisely because you can straight-up start some of the fun gimmicky builds instead of having to build up to them from a boring attack/block deck.
                Oh boy… Maybe you should give it more time. At a high level, almost every class can go infinite with their deck rather consistently whether it be infinite damage,block,energy etc. So saying that you’re forced to play with whatever you’re getting when in actual fact the high level play revolves around 1 kind of deck reveals how little you’ve played.
                    No, it's not about "forced to play", rather, I usually wanna play some specific build and have some tools to force rng to be more likely to give me needed cards/artifacts/etc. Like, I know that rogue can go into shiv build(and almost auto lose if floor 3 boss is that fucker with 12 cards reset mechanics), the usual draw/discard build(I think last time I beat with that) and with poison. I just want to play poison with that double poison card, but sadly it's locked by lots of runs, which I'd have to play without it, which isn't something I'd want to do.
            I like what some other games in the genre have done with starting cards. In STS, your starting cards are bad and you're better off removing them.

Pirates Outlaws gives every class at least one card in their starting deck that's actively great for the class's direction. Classes that are unlocked later are given some pretty wild starter decks that push them in directions that the simpler classes could never go in (for example, the Cursed Captain gets a card that discards all his curses and redraws and the Fortune Teller starts with a Curse that makes all her other cards more powerful while it's in hand).

Dawncaster made it really interesting. Each class has one or two colors, a set of basic attacks, a set of weapon abilities (passives and/or an ability that can be activated for an effect between battles), and a list of cards that you start the game with one of in your deck. You pick one of each (you get 8 copies of the basic attack). Most of them synergize in one way or another (ex. The Rogue has a basic attack that inflicts poison if chained, a weapon power that heals them whenever an enemy takes poison damage, and a starting card that increases how much damage poison inflicts per trigger). Some of them interact in crazy ways; the Hunter has a basic attack where each copy records how much damage its dealt that battle and adds it to its current damage that dovetails deliciously with a starting card that returns cards from your discard pile.

These games make it feel like you have some kind of build from the very first fight, where in STS you're often only partway there by the end of Act 1.
        It's a good game, but the art style is keeping it far from perfect.
            It's distinctive. I liked Gordian Quest, but it has the most generic art style.
            Yeah the art style is about the ugliest I can think of for an indie game. It's always kept me from truly enjoying the game. Hoping their next game changes it up.
        Its really fucking good.

Usually the RogueLite genre turns me off but a deckbuilder was just a perfect fit. 

Its great on mobile except when it eats a whole hour of my day on one run lol.
    Could be announced tomorrow at State of Play.
        I doubt it. Surely porting it to an engine other than Unity will make them have to delay it.
            Yeah, but the presentation was probably set before the Unity-news, so either they pulled it or it might still be in, if it was in the first place. If anything, it'll be just a tease
        The state of play is about updates to previously announced games.  Best to lower your expectations til they're subterranean.
    I mean, game studio working on a new game is not exactly a big news lol.
        Yeah was thinking the same. No idea why they were surprised.
            Mostly the fact that I've seen no news whatsoever about them working on anything. A lot of other studios seem to be pretty transparent about what they're working on but I've not really seen anything from Mega Crit Games.
    It's very good but that art style did it no favors. I kept pushing it way because it looked so very cheap IMO.
    Well they WERE working on a new game...
"Grandpa what radicalised you?"

"Billy they delayed the release of a new game from the Slay the Spire team by a few months"

"Eat the rich gramps"
    Slay The (Ivory) Spire
        Hilarious...

And necessary
    This but with 'they cancelled silksong'
    I wouldn't think switching to a new game engine, after more than two years of development, would be only a few months task?
        It depends. Without knowing about the game, we can only speculate, but a project like Slay the Spire has a much larger design:implementation ratio than a lot of games.
            Yeah it really varies. I imagine a lot of the time will be upskilling and learning the new tech. Once you're familiar though things *can* (but not necessarily will) go faster if a lot of it is relatively directly translatable.
            Hopefully most of the complex stuff was done in a scripting language that can easily be ported over...
        i could see it being delayed by a year at least
            Yup, came to comment this. It could very easily be more than a year of porting and learning before getting to the same speed of development.
        This is the most optimistic comment I've seen on Reddit in years.

It most likely is a massive hurdle and it's not done with just migrating to a new engine, after that is it's learning the new engine *and* fixing all the issues that come from how the new engine works differently than Unity.
            Haha, well I was fairly certain it would be a much harder task, but as soon as you say something with certainty on Reddit (rather than phrasing it like a question like I did), someone comes along and says “well actually you can port an entire game from Unity to [Other engine] in literally one click” and then I looked dumb lol
                Hah, fair enough.

And I guess I did the same thing but in reverse, lol.  
My bad, hope I didn't come off full on "akSHuALly" with my reply, not my intention.
        In terms of computer science, it will vary a truly insane amount based on their practices. Depends how organized they are and how much they got done in two years, how much is concept vs "built"
        It varies mainly by how much their team knows the new engine. The reality of game dev is that a lot of your early code will be rewritten anyway.
        Unity won't go ahead with this because it's essentially illegal and will cause them to receive an unprecedented amount of legal action. They will have to backpedal from this stupid idea
        Yeah I'm worried that grandpa might be an idiot
    This wouldn't be a few-months delay.  They'd basically need to start the entire project over.  They've been working on it for 2 years, so that's 2 years of work down the drain.
    Remember, what radicalized Grandpa will be nothing to what radicalizes the grandchildren.
You know who took another big hit, Vampire Survivor dev. They just switched to Unity recently in there latest update patch.
    Yeah that's who I was thinking of. And that dev has so many downloads of his game on mobile, no? While hitting the revue cap on Steam. It was free on mobile last time I checked with ad support. Crazy how they will be punished for creating a game and releasing it as basically a passion project at a really low cost.
        And its on gamepass too, so they are really getting fucked over by the install fee.
    Doesn't he build everything in the old engine, and then his team ports it over to Unity?

Seems like they could easily revert, but I know a lot of the effects probably rely on Unity.  

Wonder if they could port to another engine like Godot.
        The old engine is officially gone now with the latest update that adds the local co-op. The not-PC versions have always been Unity.
            Ahh, I see.  They have a good team, I'm sure they'll be fine whatever decision they make.
            Famous composer Tony Fox must be breathing a sigh of relief.

A lot of the fandom has wanted Toby to switch to Unity from GameMaker for a while just for the improved feature set, especially 60 FPS. There was even a project called UniTale to remake Undertale in Unity mostly for that 60 FPS.

He experimented in Unity for Deltarune but ultimately went with GameMaker which he knows back to front. I was disappointed at the time, but in retrospect that was a good decision. Especially considering he now has a small but full dev team to support.
I really do not understand this. They must know that barely no new game will be made with Unity from now on, right? People will just use something else.
    Pump and dump. They just need to get some good numbers for a quarter or two after the new pricing kicks in and then sell off as much they can to someone who doesn't understand the long term implications.
        [deleted]
            Is that not considered insider trading?
        Seems more like a hostile takeover to me instead, similar situation though. There's just very few other explanations other than ineptitude which I guess is usually the answer but god damn, that level of ineptitude?
I wonder if the Hollow Knight devs (Team Cherry) will comment on this.

Silksong isn't happening anytime soon if Unity doesn't back down. Team Cherry is just 3 guys, I don't think they want to pay huge sums when Silksong releases.
    >Silksong isn't happening anytime soon 

You could have just stopped there
    Ya…. I’m afraid Silksong is toast.

It’s likely only months away…. But I don’t know how that game gets released. Especially since it will lead to a resurgence of downloads of Silksong and that alone will likely cost the team millions.

I don’t know….. what a shitty situation for everyone involved
        [removed]
            You can't migrate from unity in "months".  They'd basically need to restart the entire project.
            Man I remember playing Hollow Knight years ago thinking Silksong was already out and that I should buy it to give it a try. What the heck?
                What do you mean? I thought Silksong was already out?
                    Just a few more months
            Migrating away from Unity would be years, not months
            Remember when it was 1 year (or less) away in the Xbox game show thing? Oof.
        lol in what world would this make silk song toast? they are still going to sell the game at this point, they have too much money and time sunk in to it to take a moral stance and rebuild in another engine.

they are going to sell 2M copies over its lifetime, and they are going to eat the unity fee because they are still going to make a boat load of money.
            You do realize the new fees could make that debt still
                for mobile games with low returns per user, yes, for a game with a $10+ buy-to-play model that expects hundreds of thousands or millions of sales, no. they'll have a pro or enterprise license, meaning the fee per install will range from 15 cents to 1 cent as they pass each threshold within that monthly period (1 cent at 1M+ downloads with enterprise).

there are many reasons this install fee system is an abysmal idea, but it's not going to put a game like silksong in any financial danger
                    My guess is Silksong is also gonna be like $25-30

Edit: and it should be, I'd even pay $40-50 for it tbh
                        Hollow Knight is a $60 game for sure. I have more hours in HK than I do in Mario Odyssey
                No they don't. You don't realize the scale of the fee compared to the revenue they'll have 

I did some quick calculation in another comment. Basically it's at max 2$ per sale for those BS fees (and likely smaller, that's counting 10 different devices install before the game pass 1M installs which will take a few hours at most). That's not gonna make a game like Silksong lose money. Plus that's for the free tier of Unity. I doubt a studio like Team Cherry (or Mega Crit) is using this after the success of their first games, they have lower royalties on pro licenses

The problem is far more for the small indies that are already not profitable or barely than for those big games that at worst will lose some of their huge profits. But it's important they speak out because they get more attention than random indie studios nobody knows.
                hollow knight sold ~2m units and Team Cherry has 3 people. silk song will sell at least that over its lifetime. if these fees somehow make them go in to debt they deserve it for their gross negligence.
                    Silksong is also day 1 Game Pass, which is going to add a ton of installs, but no sales no counteract the fees. Anything hitting any of GP/PS+ is hit extra hard by the new model.
                        Apparently gamepass installs are (somehow) going to be billed to Microsoft. Good luck collecting on that lmao
                            Lmao I am hoping to see them \*try\* to bill Microsoft for that. Microsoft will be more than happy to play that legal game if Unity wants to.
                        [deleted]
                            Good luck on them trying to get any money from Microsoft who have no contract/agreement with Unity at all.
                    it is per install. with free bundles, game pass, people redownloading the game it can easily take all that money
                        Look, I think this new model is shitty and Unity deserves to go down in flames over this, but to be fair, Unity clarified that redownloads won't be counted and that devs won't be paying for Game Pass downloads. If they're selling the game for more than 20 cents a copy they won't be losing money on this. There's certainly enough to be outraged about elsewhere.
                            they also have no plans on how to do this, dispite saying it I don't trust them one bit
                                You're totally right. Unity's "trust us, bro, we know how to count installs fair and square, just don't ask us how" is super shady, and of questionable legality at best.

Meanwhile Unreal is out there saying "oh yeah we go based off your self-reported revenue. We trust you."
        After the success of Hollow Knight you assume that Team Cherry is not using the free Unity license

Pro/enterprise Unity licenses pay much less per install only after a much higher ceiling of earnings
            They would still easily be paying over 10k per month with the Pro tier. Likely more seeing as Silksong is highly anticipated, not at all a tiny new IP that miraculously got 2.5m+ in sales.
                And they would be paying extra fees when people redownload hollow Knight to replay it
                    No it's just for the first install on a new device. They've changed that. So it's likely only when changing machines (I guess motherboard, that's what identify a PC right?)
                        They have failed tell mew machines apart before and have every reason to keep failing
                        Or you know, a bad actor running a farm of virtual machines with spoofed hardware IDs and IPs could run a script to continuously install on unique "new" devices to rack up a huge bill for the devs.
                            I mean that's going to a long way just to troll someone and no gain for yourself...
                                Sure is, but when you're popular enough you're inevitably going to attract people who are angry enough and bored enough with the technical knowhow who would jump at the chance to do something like this. Maybe the devs nerf their favorite playstyle, or take the game in an unpopular direction, or maybe they're just mad the game lets you select pronouns or something. I wouldn't underestimate how far some people would go over spite.
                [deleted]
                    The math some people have done on the new costs are crazy. Some of the best case scenarios for a *successful* game that costs money and has a moderate player base is around 15%, or triple what Unreal costs *at most*. And there are situations where Unity can cost even more.

Also there's a whole thing of Unity saying distributors will be the ones owing for some cases, like Game Pass, which means there are going to be more headaches because that's questionable legality in the first place.


There are some whose livelihoods depends on what they're working on releasing on time to certain success, but there are tons of devs, universities, etc. already dropping Unity and there's no way I can imagine to win anyone back
                        Unity's whole deal is that it's much cheaper than Unreal for a less powerful engine. If it's not even cheaper, why in the world would a dev ever use it again?
                            Unity is also better in ease of use, better for mobile development and is better suited for non-3d games than Unreal is. Those are pretty key areas if you are a small indie dev team trying to push, let's say a 2d rougelike card game or an atmospheric 2d metroidvania game with hand drawn sprites to a variety of platforms. That isn't to say there is no alternative to Unity, but Unreal is probably not the go to answer for many devs, especially those who are speaking out the most currently.
                10k per month is nothing when you do 500k par month (just random numbers), all is relative. Those big indies or companies using Unity won't have much of a risk there I think. It's for the smaller ones (many indies games are not profitable or barely) that it's a problem
        Let's calm down the hysteria a bit. Not going to say Unity isn't shitty for how they're trying to roll this out but Silk Song isn't going to be scrapped after being developed for 6+ years because Unity will implement a fee. These guys are probably on the pro version of Unity which lowers the license fee and the game is going to sell millions. Team Cherry will make millions and be fine.
    Oh my god.

If Silksong is delayed or cancelled because of it there will be literal riots.

(Well, online riots. People will definitely be upset)
        It can't be delayed since it never gave a release date lol
    If this causes Silksong to be delayed further, I will not be impressed. Obviously with the Unity idiots, not Team Cherry. Give me Silksong already.
    Silksong will not lose money, it'll eat into their profits as it'll be massively successful. Or not even, it's not like they announced a price so they can just include this into the sale price they decide. 

The "new version" (which IMO was always the one they intended to do but made a worse one to make it look better) is 20 cents for the first install on a new device and then 2 cents after 1M installs (which Silsong will pass day 1 basically). 

Realistically, you can expect each sale to get what? max 10 different devices "first install" lifetime (some more, some less of course). So that's between 20 cents and 2 dollars for those BS fees to Unity on a sale. If they raise their intended price by 1$ (not happy about it but let be honest, the ultimate payer in the end is always the customer), it's covering this bullshit for sure.  

And thankfully, they excluded subscriptions installs so they won't get fucked by the game being on Gamepass (well Microsoft should pay they said but good luck with that lol)

The problem is far more for the small indies that are already not profitable or barely than for those big games that at worst will lose some of their huge profits. But it's important they speak out because they get more attention than random indie studios nobody knows.

I still don't understand how Unity took such a dumbass decision that'll end up killing their company. Like if they needed money (their financials are pretty bad apparently), they could have just raised their already existing royalties prices I assume (I don't know much how they work on Unity, more familiar with Unreal)
Slay the Spire is one of my favorite games ever. it is truly incredible. 

i will gladly wait however long it takes for them to make their new game but this is deeply disappointing and entirely Unity’s fault.  this makes it so much more personal. luckily, MegaCrit likely has the financial freedom to make this switch. 

unbelievable that they would remove their TOS from their Github. incredibly scummy. even if they do a 180, why would anyone ever work with this company again.
    >unbelievable that they would remove their TOS from their Github. incredibly scummy.

Very possibly illegal too
Alienating the developers of one of the best roguelike / deck building games of the past few years sure is a choice. Great job, Unity.
    this would mean nothing, when you have something like genshin impact or pokemon in your engine
        Genshin isn't going to be covered under this change so it does mean something. Also, among games that are difficult to port to a new engine Pokemon Go is not one of them.
            Considering Unity straight up removed the clause that protected you from new TOS by running old versions, that might be their way in to at least attempt to go for Genshin. I am almost certain it won't work because a) MiHoYo is a chinese studio and foreigners don't enjoy many legal protections over there and b) pulling the TOS rug like that is illegal in many countries, including the entirety of the EU. 

This move, if someone with some money chooses to fight, could break Unity not only in reputation, but also legally and financially. I am not a lawyer, but the things I know about consumer protection laws hint at this outcome.
                Genshin isn't covered because they have a different license that excludes them from the changes made by Unity Technologies. So even if it was legal to go after other developers, it wouldn't affect Chinese developers either way.
                >This move, if someone with some money chooses to fight, could break Unity not only in reputation, but also legally and financially

Let's try Disney, Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, Valve, Epic, CDPR, Humble Bundle, EA, Blizzard, The Pokemon company and more. Unity will no longer exist if they try to enforce this on them. Microsoft could just buy Unity outright and shut them down out of spite.
                >  MiHoYo is a chinese studio and foreigners don't enjoy many legal protections over there 

Doesn't matter. Once they set foot in US jurisdiction, they have to obey US law. So they would be sued in US court.

Unless they decide to exit the US market, which I don't think will happen.
                >MiHoYo is a chinese studio and foreigners don't enjoy many legal protections over there and b) pulling the TOS rug like that is illegal in many countries, including the entirety of the EU. 

Then thier income based on Android and Apple store can get fucked. Yea the company can do thing but its money from the West would be held.
            Niantic doesn't have a great history for games they try to port to a new engine. Pokemon Go might be lucky enough to survive that given the IP, but yeah...
            Pokemon go was not the pokemon i was referencing
                Then which? The mainline games and Masters use a proprietary engine, Go is simple and portable if the cost of the engine goes up, and Unite is not affected by this change.
                    The remakes of diamond and pearl are on unity
                        And it's not even the only Nintendo IP affected. Guess what FE Engage was developed in.
                            oh boy right I remember that
                    Pokémon Brilliant Diamond And Shining Pearl
                        Those games are already released though right? It just means nintendo couldn't do updates to them anymore, and I wouldn't expect them to anyways.
                            This situation affects games already released. So no not updating them does nothing.
                                That seems... totally insane and unenforceable if that's true. The game was already published under the old license. I don't understand how they could try to change the contract agreement on an already developed and published game. It seems... Impossible? Like if there was active development and updates for a game I could see how they could try to collect those fees, but otherwise I don't see how that's possible.
                                    Well yeah it is insane and thats why everyone is up in arms
                                It's true that the new pricing structure applies to previously released games. However I think it's highly likely that for something as big as the Pokemon games, they made an individual license agreement with Unity ahead of time. Big companies like that don't just create an account on Unity's website and subscribe to a few Pro version seats. They workout their own licensing deals for the engine. This new pricing scheme won't apply to their games.
        I would also bet the big games like that and hearthstone are getting their own custom deals.

No way would they risk their big dogs.
            Will have to see because it wasnt a risk before right.
                Acti-blizz legal doesn't fuck around like that. They'll have a custom license.
                The sourcing and contract people at my much smaller company wouldn't allow a contract that doesn't have pricing set in very solid stone. Pretty much every contract we have is custom. 

There is no way a large company like blizzard or Nintendo wouldn't have a custom contract.
                    They'll be sued into the stone age by Microsoft since they plan to charge them, a company they do not have a contract with, fees per game install. They are outright delusional.
        There is zero chance either of those games is using the shrink-wrap license, even at the highest tier. They almost certainly have a negotiated agreement that won't be subject to this fuckery.
It doesn't seem like a good idea to continue working on Unity even if they do completely rollback these changes. The prospect that they would propose retroactively charging fees should just ruin any and all trust in the company.

    Not a real question. I don't even need to read their TOS to know they will have a caveat in all their documents stating they can change anything in the contract at will, with little to no notice.
        You can right whatever you write in a TOS it doesn't mean it's legal or enforceable.
        Just because you put something into a contract doesn't mean it's legal to put in a contract. As a hypothetical, if the contract said Unity had the right to kill your first-born child, they wouldn't actually have that right.

I'm not a lawyer so I do not want to speak on whether or not what they've actually done is legal.
            Always with the extremes LOL.

Pretty cut and dry my dudes. People messaging me here like they've never read a contract in their life. It's the same with the Unreal Engine. It's their property, they can do what they want with it.
                Yes, I used an extreme hypothetical to illustrate the point. That was the entire point of my comment. I'm not here to refute what is or isn't in the contract. I'm saying that just because it's there does not mean it's legally enforceable. A contract isn't some magic spell that lets you do anything you want to. You're responding to the question of "is this legal to do" with the idea that it's in the contract, and that's simply not a legitimate answer.
                I don't think you understood what people were telling you. There are authorities above Unity that will enforce their own rules, no matter what the contract says. For example, if you make an online store in Europe and on your ToS you say "by buying in this store you waive your right to refund within 14 days", it doesn't matter. You still have to refund people if they ask you to or they can take you to court in Europe and you will lose. 

So what the other posters were saying is that *if* retroactively applying a ToS is illegal in certain places, then it doesn't matter that they added that clause in it.
        Pretty sure that is not legal.
    > The real question is, it it even LEGAL for Unity to do this retroactively?

It's legal if they say so
    Why can’t a company say they changed their mind, starting in 90 days the price is going up? It happens all the time
        [deleted]
            So you’re saying the law should change and business to business contracts should require more notice? Or that this is the law now?
I’ve started to feel like Slay the Spire may be one of the greatest games ever made. Up there with Super Mario World and The Legend of Zelda.

I go back to it over and over. I still do the daily challenge on my phone every time I think about it.
    It's so well designed. I end up wishing other games were more like it.

Hades is great, but an ascension system instead of choosing Heat levels could be a better experience, with difficulty scaling in a curated way rather than giving you a list of options of what you want to try to cheese.

Diablo 4's usage of Vulnerable is so, so much worse than StS's. A flat percentage bonus to attack damage that you can also synergize with is powerful already, you don't need to make gear boost that percentage so it beats all other strategies.
    My only complaint is that the visuals are pretty meh. But the gameplay is incredible.
These guys come across as super cool. It sucks to see their next game is being affected by this clusterfuck of a decision by Unity.
Can anyone provide a transcript of the statement please?
    (Mega Crit and Slay the Spire logos)

"The Mega Crit team has been hard at work these past 2+ years on a new game. But unlike with Slay the Spire, the engine we have been developing it in is Unity.

The retroactive pricing structure of Runtime Fees is not only harmful in a myriad of ways to developers--especially indies--it is also a violation of trust. We believe Unity is fully aware of this, seeing as they have gone so far as to remove their TOS from GitHub.

Despite the immense amount of time and effort our team has already poured into development on our new title, we will be migrating to a new engine unless the changes are completely reverted and TOS protections are put in place.

We have never made a public statement before. That is how badly you fucked up."
        Thanks so much for writing this all out!
I hope they change engines regardless if Unity reverses their decision,  the company can no longer be trusted.
    That's why the mentioned that they will require "TOS Protections."

In other words, Unity needs to guarantee in contract that they cannot change the terms unilaterally later on.
The weird part to me is that they're totally willing to use Unity still.  As long as this change gets reverted, they'd stay on that engine.

Despite this change applying retroactively, and the TOS removal shenanigans, they'd still use Unity if the company reverts course... despite having no clue if they'd try this again next year or something.

Seems incredibly stupid.  At this point, they've shown they can't be trusted, so why are you willing to risk it?
    Changing engines means abandoning years of custom inhouse tooling, losing all engine experience with your current staff and is a huge overall business cost.

No one WANTS to change to a new technical stack if they do not have to.
        With the direction Unity as a company is going, changing to a new technical stack is inevitable. The issues with Unity goes beyond them trying to nick and dime their customers, the entire company is becoming dumpster fire.

The warning signs have been there for years that Unity is not a horse you want to bet anymore on, yet these devs chose to ignore them. And even now they are refusing to stop betting on it.
            Agreed, but I'm not surprised that studios that are already knee deep in a project built in Unity are trying to push back for the short term. Mega Crit might have already 100% decided that they're not going to use Unity for any new projects, but they could have tens of thousands of work hours put into a current project, and trying to port it to a new engine now would very likely add thousands of more hours to it.

It's not the kind of switch that every studio is in a situation to make on a dime.
        For sure, but now they'll forever be wondering if they're risking their business by not doing so
            I don't think there will be any wondering at all. They are 100% not going to use unity for any other future projects, even if this runtime fee thing is completely rolled back.
    Ultimately it's a business and they've already invested 2+ years into the game. An engine swap this far into development could be hard to justify financially.
    They would only continue if the changes are reverted AND TOS protections are put into place. I'd still bet that even if they those changes were to happen, they'd still switch engines after finishing development of their current project. Once trust is broken like this, there's no going back only putting up with it as long as possible until you can make an easy break from it.
    A lot of people aren't going to.  Damage is done.  Trust is lost.  Everyone knows these scum ass companies always try again in the future.
What are other engines that are viable to use instead of unity?
    Godot, Unreal
Same dumb ass ex EA ceo of thinks he can price gouge Devs like he did gamers. Hope this backfires big time.
I'm kind of disappointed they didn't go with LibGDX again for their next game. Games using their own engines are much more interesting from a technical point of view than everyone just using Unreal or Unity (or even Godot)

And they tend to perform better as well as they don't have to ship a decade of feature creep.
[deleted]
    Yes… I bet that is what the executives think they did.


But…. I really think that Unity is fucking dead. No publisher is going to touch Unity games with a 10 foot pole now (Divolver Digital has already alluded to this publicly, and you can bet every other publisher is thinking the same thing).

If your game has 0% chance of being picked up by a publisher, why would you even think about building it in Unity? 

Unity has about 3 years of new releases and any incumbents that they can milk for cash. And then that’s it. 

5 years from now Unity is going to be a dead company. Even if they backtrack…. Trust is gone.
        That's what happens after an IPO apparently lmao
            [removed]
    Maybe some can switch to Gadot? It supports C#
        Supporting the same language is very useful for keeping existing internal logic, but any time you're talking to the engine's API's you mostly gotta rewrite that shit to fit the new engine.
            Oh yeah that could be a major issue, especially if not all API calls are 1:1 between engine.
Again, every time. They say "it will especially affect indies!" while the policy explicitly doesn't affect them.

Every single dev so far managed to fail a reading test.
    The thresholds are low enough that it'll affect any half-decent indie team, not even mentioning the successful ones. The only part that it doesn't affect are bad games that people don't bother to play/spend money on.
They recently hired a community manager so I figured they were working on something, and a while back they hired an artist who previously worked on Dicey Dungeons. I believe they have stated they aren't making a sequel, but that's about all we know.

I expect it's a bit further away now. May have to buy slay the spire on yet another platform to help em out.
    What platform do you not have it on? Imagine a port to those stupid refrigerators with the screens. Lol
        I've always wanted to play games on Android Auto, personally
            "Hey siri. Buy more grandmas in cookie clicker."
        StS is the new Doom. Soon enough we'll see people doing A20 streaks on oscilloscopes and tamagotchis
    The madlads actually made their first game in libgdx out of everything available, so honestly, I can believe they wouldn't take THAT long to get their stuff onto a new engine.
    > May have to buy slay the spire on yet another platform to help em out.

Just remember to not install the game :)
        I know you're joking, but Slay the Spire is not made in Unity.
            Ah, you're correct. I forgot that part immediately after reading it. Thanks!
Made me laugh out loud.

No point making vague statements. Tell everyone how you feel.
You only get one first and they made it count.
Only fitting for the Pandora's box that unity opened with their policy. Even if they revert the fact that they did it once will never disappear. Every halfway successful dev using unity in the future will hunt them down to have personalised contracts they can't retroactively change or seriously invest in alternatives.

It's sad. The availability of ready made game engines has been such a massive move forward for gaming as a whole. 15 years ago making games was a massive undertaking requiring hundreds of thousands of dollars for an engine licence or a team of specialised programmers to make your own.
Yeah this is a professional company statement and then it ends like some rant Reddit comment lol.
    They aren't a giant publisher. These companies are made up of passionate people that pour countless hours of energy into a product that we all can enjoy.

Not every statement has to be some soulless litigation proof memorandum.
        I know that's why it's funny? They make it look like a PR statement and then end up with a fuck lol
            Ah, I thought you were trying to say the opposite.
[removed]
    I don't think they will back-pedal either, but they'll have to compromise somehow with how negative the reaction has been to the announcement. Not to mention it's not a few indie devs they're affecting here, motherfucking League of Legends use Unity, for example, how Unity is going through with this without a bunch of legal teams burning their ass is beyond me
        Genshin Impact, Marvel Snap, and Pokemon Go all run on Unity too, and I dunno who in their right mind would want to take on Hoyoverse, Disney, and Nintendo all at the same time.
            Yeah, they're fucked. This is going to be hilarious.
                I'm pretty sure Microsoft is on the list too. I think they claimed that fee's will be charged to the distributors, so unity games on GamePass. Or Microsoft just pulls Unity based games from their catalog, but time will tell.
                    
>I think they claimed that fee's will be charged to the distributors

Which is fucking hysterical, because that means they're also going to try to charge Valve, Epic, EA, CDPR, Sony, Nintendo and a variety other storefronts as well. None of whom have contracts with them. They apparently *want* to be sued by everyone under the sun.

I don't think they even consulted a lawyer, this is so blatantly illegal I'm shocked that they thought this was a good idea.
                        Well consider the CEO was trh same EA guy who had bright ideas such as making the player pay money to repair their in-game car and generally made EA look like the greediest, worst gaming company and it starts making sense.

Why a clown like that is still in such a high ranked highly paid position is still baffling
                            >Why a clown like that is still in such a high ranked highly paid position is still baffling

He apparently sold off stock like a week or two ago before dropping this. He might end up being investigated by financial regulators at the end of this lol.
                                Bet he's shorting the stock too, or having someone else do it on his behalf.
                            > Why a clown like that is still in such a high ranked highly paid position is still baffling

Rich people have benefits us lowly workers don't have, including the advantage of failing your way upwards.
                        Yeah, when devs started asking Unity folks how things like gamepass would work with this, the response they got from management was basically "Well we're going to have to sit down and have some discussions with the subscription services about it."

I didn't go to business school, so maybe I'm way off base here, but maybe you should've had those conversations and figured all of this out with the relevant parties before you announce a major change that you say is going to go into effect 4 months from now. 

Microsoft/Valve/Epic/Sony/Apple/Nintendo/etc. are all going to tell Unity to go pound sand if asked to cough up a payment per install. They don't want to have to track that stuff for a third party company, and at this point, there's no way any of them are going to want to wade into this mess on Unity's side.
                            Great point. Did they really think the platform holders would be all chill with this?
                    Microsoft owns Obsidian now I think, who made Pillars of Eternity 1 & 2 with Unity.
                        The Ori games are Unity as well, perhaps even the new game that Moon Studios is working on?

I think Hearthstone is Unity as well? So ActiBlizz also in the boat
            Don't forget Microsoft, EA, and Sony. Plus you can probably include Valve, Apple, and Google, as they're the ones distributing the games and thus the ones that somehow need to track unique installs.
            You think they don't know this? This is exactly the companies they are going for, the indies are just a nice extra. Unity also has a lot of money, and at some point more money doesn't help you in legal battles. Courts have to decide this, although I have high hopes that this won't fly in europe at all.
            All of them with get special exclusive deals that eliminate the fees
        All of Hoyoverse's popular games use Unity, as well. And they have enough fuck you money to get into a massive legal battle over this if they wanted.
            And that money will presumably get backup from the plumber's ninjas and the Mouse's legal team. All Unity has done here is given everyone else a target, ironically causing unity in the process.
        Wild Rift you mean? I think League on PC runs a variation of some big rigs engine or some shit.
        > I don't think they will back-pedal either,

They already did a little bit. Mostly about re-installs. But most people didn't hear about it because they didn't update their official pages on this and as Mega Crit mentioned, the trust has already been broken.
    Sadly not many great alternatives.
        Unreal has always been a strong contender, and I've heard good things about Godot as well. Honestly Godot might be the biggest winner coming out of all this.
            People also sleep on Game Maker. Games like Hotline Miami, Hyper Light Drifter, and Undertale were made with it. It's a *very* capable engine if smaller scale, 2D stuff is what a dev team is going for.
            Godot doesn't have real console support without doing it yourself completely which is why it's not viable for a lot of smaller devs. Unreal is more high end option that is not always suitable for smaller teams.
    >I see no reason why any indie dev would go near Unity even if they back-pedalled completely  

If you are small indie dev (basically solo) and arent trying to make f2p game. There is no reason why not. Most games dont earn even close that much money. Currently learning about Unity myself, wouldnt mind paying 20% from 200k IF i would hit it big (but most likely will not happen).
        It's not 20%. That would be steep, but within the realms of reason. Or at least the realms of, well, reality.

It's $0.20 per install. Not per sale, per *install*. There are so many problems with tacking it to installs rather than sales that it's difficult to fully get it across. Just for starters though, imagine someone bought your game, and then paid for a botnet to install said game on 10,000 devices. Now imagine they bought your cheap game 100 times and installed on each device 100 times.

Someone spent maybe a grand at most on a botnet and 100 copies of your game, and now you owe $200,000 to Unity. As a small indie dev, you're probably bankrupt and whatever internet troll you pissed off is laughing his ass off.

And this is assuming that Unity somehow manages to put together a decent enough install detection system that means you need to actually buy the game and have a botnet to do this. More realistically, their methods for detecting installs will by shoddy, and one guy who bought your game and doesn't care for it much might be able to spoof thousands of installs a day on their computer with a simple VPN and a script.
            >It's $0.20 per install. Not per sale, per install.  

I know, I just went with worst assumption in mind (basically sale for 1 game for 1$). Unity said, that they wouldnt make pay for re-install (for same game) AND that they would check for bad actors (how the hell, they will do that, that is a very fucking good question).  

>And this is assuming that Unity somehow manages to put together a decent enough install detection system that means you need to actually buy the game and have a botnet to do this.  

Yes, would love to see how they will implement this.  
I can see this being fine, if using Steam (or any of big launchers), but will see. Either way this is a big L for Unity and its community.
                > Unity said, that they wouldnt make pay for re-install

You'd still need to pay per device though. If someone buys your $1 game and installs it on their PC, their laptop, their phone, their work PC, and their friend's PC, suddenly you owe Unity 100% of that sale. Then they get a new PC and a new phone a year later and suddenly you're losing money on each game.
                    >If someone buys your $1 game and installs it on their PC, their laptop, their phone, their work PC, and their friend's PC, suddenly you owe Unity 100% of that sale.  

Yeap, that is the super bad scenario :( Thats why waiting for more info. But it still would require those 200k profit and 200k installs. So at worst, can stop selling game when you get close to 200k sales (if sale is 1$).  
This will hit mobile, f2p markets the most.
        > Currently learning about Unity myself, wouldnt mind paying 20% from 200k IF i would hit it big

  Ok bro, except you probably wont. Stop simping for unity...
            Mate, I literally said that I most likely wouldnt.  
I am just saying that if you are solo dev then these changes dont matter for more than 90% of users. Rarely you will see solo dev with 200k in revenue and 200k installs in a year.
        Even if this particular change wouldn't affect you, what would stop Unity from changing the terms again? They have shown that they are willing to fuck their users over.
    There's no way they don't backpedal, they're angering some of the major players with this BS, and this ensures all short and long term revenue dries up since nobody wants to make games under these harsh terms.
This is way worse than that. And that's saying a lot, because WotC shot themselves in the foot real hard with their version of this.
And the Reddit API fees that killed 3rd party apps just two months ago...

I use Unity. I play D&D. I used a 3rd party Reddit app. Been a rough year for me.
What happened with dnd?
    The original license meant people could use the mechanics of D&D to make their own games and settings. It also allowed people to make money from the games they created with their new settings/games. This is how the first version of pathfinder came about.

They were going to change the license to retroactively claim the rights to any content created on the old terms. This would allow WotC to use it however they wanted without permission or payment. Also they wanted to start making companies using the ogl hand over a large percentage of any money made. Not profit just revenue.

They were basically trying to put their competitors out of business and seize control of the IPs they created. I believe that Wizards backed down completely and put the original OGL in a creative commons license in the end.
    I want to expand the fantastic answer given by /u/Ok-Discount3131 : 

In the aftermath, the publisher of the competing tabletop system Pathfinder (which basically has its roots in DnD 3e, and thus is also considered at least partly to be OGL content) decided on the radical step of remastering the current second edition of the game to not include **any** content under the OGL anymore.

That means they will remove monsters, races even names of magic spells that come even close to what Wizards made. (they'll replace them with their own versions)

This is because they have no choice - Wizards demonstrated that they are a bad actor here and can never be trusted anymore. The same thing will happen with Unity: **the trust is permanently broken** and you absolutely can't build your own business on trusting them anymore.
        Worth also adding on top of this, they made their own ogl equivalent in response, [ORC](https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sico?). They made sure to make it completely irrevocable.
It's wall street cashing in on everything with short sighted money grabs. the market get turbulent, and none of them actually has a fucking clue on how to create value, so they will ostracize the bulk of their customers as they wring the money they need for the next quarter out of the couple who are slow to leave. then everything folds, they write off the losses over the next 30 years and look for the next pump and dump.
god, I'm convinced slay the spire is a perfect game
    It's a top 3 roguelite for sure.
        isaac, spelunky, and spire are the holy trinity for me.
            FTL too
                FTL will always be number one in my heart
                    For as much as I love FTL I sure am terrible at it.
                        I think it's one of the hardest roguelikes without being unfun, theres a lot going on in it, both mechanically and in decision making.
                        I thought being terrible at it was the point. Are you telling me people are good at it? Unthinkable.

Oh, my crew got spaced again.
                        Use pause a lot more, for example pause before missle impact and turn on cloak
                    I remember the first time I played FTL. I downloaded it at like 7 PM and figured I would play for a couple of hours and call it a night. When I lifted my head from the game it was 4 AM.
                I unfortunately find the end game of FTL painfully unsatisfying and restrictive. The perfect game is a heavily modded FTL where the player's power level outscales the original game by degrees, and has challenges to match.

Of course the best of those also tell you the final challenges ahead of time, and Oh Hey, that's a Slay the Spire thing. Game so good it fixes other good games.
                What about Streets of Rouge?
            No dead cells?! Your subjective opinion is wrong!
                Sorry /u/DeadCellsTop5 the best I can do is 6th place
                    Wrong! Lol. I actually have dead cells as my #4 game on my top 25 all-time list. I fucking love that game. I've got Slay the Spire at #9 on the same list, so I fucking love that game too.
                        Would you share your top 25 list? I’m curious. Thanks

My rule is only one game per series is allowed, otherwise it's too repetitive with multiple from the same franchise. It's also always changing. This is where I'm at now, though. Not a big RPG guy, nor a Nintendo guy.
                                Your lack of Metal Gear Solid representation is disturbing
                Personally I'd like it more if it forced the player to react to builds more, react to rng. Even with all items unlocked it's not too hard to end up at similar setups in back to back runs, especially with how powerful shops are, let alone with Wish. And the boring stat system ensures you've already committed to a stat before the end of the first level. It is great fun to get in the zone and not drop balanced blade stacks throughout an entire biome, and bosses can be fun in the Goldilocks zone between the struggle bus and instantly vaporizing them with things like baseball bat or half of tactics.

My favorite roguelite currently is Against the Storm by contrast, where playing at a high level is defined by how well you react to the hand you're dealt. StS is also like this at a high level, though some archetypes become near impossible to build past a15.

Edit: To summarize, Dead Cells is a fine action 2d platformer, and not a great roguelite for me.
                    I second Against the Storm, it's a mix of a roguelike with the old city builders (Caesar/Pharaoh) where you can actually lose which makes it more appealing than say Two Point Campus where you eventually just win.  Add in the fact that no game feels the same and it's easily one of my picks of this decade.
                        I've tried the Against the Storm demo a couple of times and can't get into it? Which is sad because rougelites and city builders are my two favourite genres. Did it take a while for it to 'click' for you?
                            It took me a few games to get it to click (like ignore house locations etc) but once the difficulty starts ramping up it has a great gameplay loop.  I'd say it's more old school builder (theme hospital,caesar 3) rather than cities skylines as you're building around the disasters/resources rather than making a nice looking city.  I personally have 221 hours in it so far.
                    can you define roguelite for me? feels like we've lost the plot when a city builder is a roguelite.
                        How about:

A game where you perform a series of "runs" where each run has a significant amount of randomness. Each run is challenging and failure/death may frequently end the run unsuccessfully. Often, roguelites have some kind of meta-progression between runs. Roguelites are intended to be played many times, rather than once and done, since a lot of content or progression is only unlocked after multiple runs.

Against the Storm is clearly a roguelite imo.
                            I would also add that each run isn't particularly long. I think for me, most "runs" when learning cap out at 35 minutes or so. Once I am good at them, under 25 or under 20.
                            is tropico a roguelite? randomness, runs, meta progression, gated content.
                                I don't think tropico has the same level of randomness (you can build any/all the same buildings every time, maps and events are handmade for campaign mode) nor is failure/death a significant threat. There also is no progression if you fail. It's just a regular campaign game. Frequent failure is a core part of the experience of roguelites.
                        I would define a roguelite as: short run/round/map-focused gameplay, start from scratch each run, high variance in equipment/cards/enemies/objectives/strategy each run, after each run you have meta progression for the next run. Against the storm and slay the spire ticks all these boxes.
                        Against the Storm is undoubtedly a roguelite haha, I don't care to quibble about this. It's a roguelite first, the towns you build are extremely temporary in nature, the city-building nature plays second fiddle to the fact that all your buildings and decisions are meant to win the map, not raise a mighty city or empire.
                Can't forget Hades
                Always feel like I'm taking crazy pills because I did not like Dead Cells at all. I play tons of roguelites and Dead Cells would be towards the bottom of the rankings. I found nothing about the game engaging.
                    Boy, you crazy! Nah, it's all personal opinion, so it doesn't matter. I find the combat so incredibly satisfying. It's quick, it's snappy, it's predictable. I LOVE the dodge roll and how your can dodge cancel out of nearly any animation. I honestly think it's the best 2D action game out there because the combat is damn near perfect. Then the biomes are all distinct with their own enemy types and the ng+ modes add so much to an already stellar game. Then throw in all of the build possibilities with all the weapons and the multiple branching pathways and it's like roguelite heaven for me.
                        See that's the weird thing, my biggest complaint is that I didn't like the combat. Maybe if I unlocked more stuff I would have enjoyed it more - that is kind of a common gripe with roguelites. But yeah the combat from the handful of hours I played just bored me.
                            Man, that's crazy to me. That combat is incredible. Pretty much every review praises it. I've never seen anyone complain about the combat before. You should give it another shot, or at least watch some gameplay from a streamer or someone deeper in the game. The weapon variety is insane too.
                                The weapon variety at least at the start of the game seemed really limited. And maybe I just don't actually like 2d action combat lol.
                No Dead Cells and no Hades. 

Hades, Dead Cells and Slay the Spire is the trinity of roguelikes IMO. FTL if it's a quatuor
            Enter the Gungeon is clearly the best and it's not even close. This discussion make me realise how many amazing roguelites there are, wow!
                I was going to say the same! Enter the Gungeon on a hypothetical "best roguelite games" list would be the top if not real close to it. The game is just so damn charming on top of some highly addicting gameplay.
                    I love the game but it’s too f’ing hard for me. Took me 70 hrs to beat the Dragun and that was with a Sir Junkan lucky but cheesy strat. It was just too hard to get enough time on the lower levels. I didn’t put serious time after the large expansion/patch they did but heard it got balanced a bit smoother.

Edit: also played it on Switch which may have had something to do with it. I was shocked at how much better a Hades player I was on a 144 hz monitor at high res.
            And Monster Train, I think the only card roguelite I really liked. There is Erannorth Chronicles but that one is more sandbox than roguelite.
            Noita is #1 for me but inno what 2 and 3 are
            Risk of Rain 2
    There are some games I have more fun with, but I genuinely think StS is a perfectly designed game. It's got insane depth at higher levels while not bogging everything down. It's just so clean.
        Something that I think STS got right is how difficult it is to play defensively. I like Pirates Outlaws and Dawncaster more than STS, but both of those games made defending easier. The problem is that defensive strats are significantly easier than offensive ones; if you take one big hit, you have to expend resources to recover that could be spent elsewhere. If your deck is defensive and kills opponent gradually without taking damage, you can spend your resources on something else, adding up significantly over the course of a run.
    I've played a ton of similar games and none of them have StS's replay value. They all lack it's sheer fun factor, even if they have more depth to them. I've gotten A20 with all the characters and I still load it up here and there.
        Have you beaten the heart with all 4 though? That shit can make a man lose his damn mind lol
            Baalorlord (one of the top StS players) said something along the lines of A10 Heart being harder than A20 without Heart. I'm not sure how much I agree with it but it's definitely a massive step up to fight the Heart on any ascension. It's a very befitting boss as the ultimate test of your deck.
                Heart is just ridiculous. You can have a deck that absolutely crushes everything, including the boss before the heart, only to get wiped by the heart in 3 turns. It can be very deflating. Still haven't beaten it with the watcher
                    Watcher is a tricky character to play but once you get the hang of her you'll realize she's way stronger than the initial three. She came later and didn't get quite as much balancing, to the point people say she's like a fan made character. The most consistent way to play her is to stance dance, to the point if all you're doing is taking absolutely no cards in Act 1 except Talk to the Hand, Mental Fortress, Tantrum (if you haven't upgraded Eruption yet), 1 Inner Peace or Fear No Evil, and Rushdown and you'll build an infinite which can brute force a win in a small number of attempts.
                        I once watched Jorbs go unreasonably far in a Watcher A20 run taking zero cards to make a point. The biggest mistake people make with Watcher is not realizing how strong her starting deck is and adding a bunch of junk to it.
                        Watcher being the strongest character is exactly what leads to Watcher runs primarily fizzling at the Heart battle.

Even infinites can fail against heart if you don't find passive block generation as you are forced to tank a LOT of damage across the first three turns no matter what.
                        I don't think it's that they didn't balance it as much, it's that her main mechanic of Wrath is one of these things where it's either broken or it feels very bad and not that fun, and they'd rather have Watcher be fun for the average player even if she ends up broken for A20 players.
                    lifecoach1981 is currently doing 50 watcher wins in a row on twitch, sitting on 21 right now. maybe you can learn some tricks there (asc 20 ofc) - but be warned, some runs take 8 hours..
                        Ages ago when he was a Hearthstone pro he was called "ropecoach" because he always used the maximum turn time to think (the ending countdown is visualized by a rope that burns across the screen)

Looks like some things never change...
                            People still meme about him in Hearthstone even though he hasn't been playing the game for like 5 years.
                        Is he beating the heart every time? I've beaten the game with the watcher, just not the heart
                            Yes, a win = ASC20 including heart. Is at 22 in a row now, just finished his latest run an hour ago :)
                    Heart isn't the biggest problem. The problem is the last path towards it. Starts with a resting site which is useless there in terms of healing because you'll heal all the way after the boss anyway. So you can either upgrade one card or if you're lucky and have the relics either get another relic or get more HP. All of these are mostly useless there. Then a merchant, then that Miniboss with the two attacking sides. Those two are already massively dangerous and I mostly go out of that fight with half health. And with that sliver to survive the heart is almost impossible. Would be a whole lot easier if the resting site came after the miniboss.
                    I beat the very first heart fight i ever did with the silent, had that relic that revives with 50% HP and forgot about it, also had Fairy in a bottle lol, literally died twice to win, crazy fight.

I beat the boss before the heart in like 4 turns.

It was a Bullet Time, Runic Pyramid run where i would draw 10 cards every turn and Snecko Skull applying like 50 poison per turn, very fun
                    Pro tip: To help beat the Heart with Watcher, "see a Talk to the Hand, take a Talk to the Hand"
                Eyy, another Baalorlord enjoyer! I kind of agree with him, tbh. I've got to A20 on every character, but I'm only up to A5 with heart kills (so I can't speak to his exact statement about A10 heart, unfortunately). Act 4 requires different tactics than the rest of the game, to some extent, so building a deck to do it all is an extra challenge.
                    What I'm not sure I agree with is how much higher is the jump in difficulty. I'm not sure it's as high as 10 ascensions. That said, he has like 6k more hours than me and the last time I touched A10H was when I was climbing ascensions, so I don't have a good reference to what not fighting the Heart feels like since I always prepared for it.
                        Ahh, gotcha! Yeah, I did a climb to 20 first to adjust to the new mechanics at each level before I went into dedicated heart kills. I got a couple here and there on runs I felt were going well, but now I'm counting it as my win condition to ascend.
                        I've beaten A20H on all 4 characters multiple times and I dropped down to A10 for fun. I am way more successful at A10H than I am at even getting out of act 2 on A20 lol. Maybe I just suck, but I'd guess for me it'd be like A20 is easier than A17H
            Nah, not on A20
        >Even if they have more depth to them

What on earth are you smoking that you think there are multiple other games that have more depth than slay the spire? The level of depth, especially going for the heart on a20 is as deep of a strategy game as there is out there.
        Slay the Spire then becomes stupidly better with Downfall. It's like every single one of the best modders came together to make Slay the Spire 2.

I consider Marisa a base game character too. One of the best designed standalone ones. They actually have some custom logic just for ger cards in Downfall.
            I'll check it out. Never played any mods or anything.
        I've also hit A20 and after struggling for a million years to try and beat it, I just started playing custom games for fun.

Shit reinvirgorated the game for me and I have hundreds of hours. Screwing around in the game is as fun as trying hard IMO.
    it is. there's lots of imitators and they're fun in their own way but StS has that perfect ratio of RNG and consistency that makes it perfect.
    It’s what got my gf hooked on gaming. We play a round before bed almost every night
    It’s a game that fits perfectly that niche between deckbuilding, dungeon crawling, and gambling.

One of the very few games I’ve replayed until the end many times. Currently on my third run to A20 all classes: did it on PC eons ago, Xbox when it hit Game Pass, and on my phone now that it’s on Apple Arcade.
        Is the iOS port any good? The Android one is terrible. Still the same game, but poorly executed. Cards are sticky, so you wind up playing cards you were trying to read if you're not really careful. Not using Save and Quit can result in your run getting deleted entirely when your phone moves STS out of RAM. Etcetera.
            It's pretty good. I run into the sticky card problem sometimes and it's worse on iPhone because sometimes you pull up the notification center screen and it minimizes the game. It's a UX issue.

Other than that, performance wise, it's great. STS never crashed, I've never ran into the save issue, STS never locked my phone. FWIW I have an iPhone 14 Pro, but I think it runs great on older phones, as long as it isn't an iPhone SE or an X.
        What about the heart, though?
            A20 Heart is way too hard. I don’t have the skill to do that. I’ll leave to the pros and streamers. :(
    Its very very good, but I might stop just short of "perfect". There are just enough little things I could imagine being better: difficulty gap between the easist and hardest elites, the extreme difficulty spikes in the A-teens, writhing mass being added to the game.

Its not like you can "just fix it" though. I stopped playing for a few years and after i came back, Silent has Blade Dance buffed and one of the discard cards became uncommon and just those 2 changes basically made it a totally different class. This type of game is insanely hard to develop so the fact its so good is crazy.
    The slow unlock process at the start keeps it from being perfect in my opinion.

I played it years ago and was bored as hell because all my runs were just playing Attack Attack Attack Block Block Block. I think I got to the second boss a few times then just stopped playing because it was so bland.

Wasn't until I got a Steam Deck that I gave it another go, and found that I'd stopped just before I started unlocking some interesting synergies with new cards. Now I'm interested, but I could have been hooked immediately if it actually started this way.


Lot of games seem to want to imitate Binding of Isaac these days, in that they hide most of their content until you've beaten a few runs. But BoI still had a large pool of items even from the very start.
        I found the game Vault of the Void to have a much better take on this, where every single starting deck had no generic "Attack" and "Block" cards, they all had some other effect or nuance, which in some cases were pretty major.
            Sounds interesting, I'll give it a look!
        I tried to get the last rogue unlock several times and each time after completing a run and seeing that I still needed lots of runs I just "nope" and deleted the game...

RNG is pretty wild, and you have close to no way with controlling it. I like roguelites which have some unlocking over time mechanics of rerolling offers or bumping chances of specific buff/card classes. It feels good when you finished the game few times, get some upgrade to force some build and try out different builds, instead here you're forced to play whatever you're getting on each run.
            If you haven't tried Vault of the Void yet, definitely give it a look. I got into it precisely because you can straight-up start some of the fun gimmicky builds instead of having to build up to them from a boring attack/block deck.
            Oh boy… Maybe you should give it more time. At a high level, almost every class can go infinite with their deck rather consistently whether it be infinite damage,block,energy etc. So saying that you’re forced to play with whatever you’re getting when in actual fact the high level play revolves around 1 kind of deck reveals how little you’ve played.
                No, it's not about "forced to play", rather, I usually wanna play some specific build and have some tools to force rng to be more likely to give me needed cards/artifacts/etc. Like, I know that rogue can go into shiv build(and almost auto lose if floor 3 boss is that fucker with 12 cards reset mechanics), the usual draw/discard build(I think last time I beat with that) and with poison. I just want to play poison with that double poison card, but sadly it's locked by lots of runs, which I'd have to play without it, which isn't something I'd want to do.
        I like what some other games in the genre have done with starting cards. In STS, your starting cards are bad and you're better off removing them.

Pirates Outlaws gives every class at least one card in their starting deck that's actively great for the class's direction. Classes that are unlocked later are given some pretty wild starter decks that push them in directions that the simpler classes could never go in (for example, the Cursed Captain gets a card that discards all his curses and redraws and the Fortune Teller starts with a Curse that makes all her other cards more powerful while it's in hand).

Dawncaster made it really interesting. Each class has one or two colors, a set of basic attacks, a set of weapon abilities (passives and/or an ability that can be activated for an effect between battles), and a list of cards that you start the game with one of in your deck. You pick one of each (you get 8 copies of the basic attack). Most of them synergize in one way or another (ex. The Rogue has a basic attack that inflicts poison if chained, a weapon power that heals them whenever an enemy takes poison damage, and a starting card that increases how much damage poison inflicts per trigger). Some of them interact in crazy ways; the Hunter has a basic attack where each copy records how much damage its dealt that battle and adds it to its current damage that dovetails deliciously with a starting card that returns cards from your discard pile.

These games make it feel like you have some kind of build from the very first fight, where in STS you're often only partway there by the end of Act 1.
    It's a good game, but the art style is keeping it far from perfect.
        It's distinctive. I liked Gordian Quest, but it has the most generic art style.
        Yeah the art style is about the ugliest I can think of for an indie game. It's always kept me from truly enjoying the game. Hoping their next game changes it up.
    Its really fucking good.

Usually the RogueLite genre turns me off but a deckbuilder was just a perfect fit. 

Its great on mobile except when it eats a whole hour of my day on one run lol.
Could be announced tomorrow at State of Play.
    I doubt it. Surely porting it to an engine other than Unity will make them have to delay it.
        Yeah, but the presentation was probably set before the Unity-news, so either they pulled it or it might still be in, if it was in the first place. If anything, it'll be just a tease
    The state of play is about updates to previously announced games.  Best to lower your expectations til they're subterranean.
I mean, game studio working on a new game is not exactly a big news lol.
    Yeah was thinking the same. No idea why they were surprised.
        Mostly the fact that I've seen no news whatsoever about them working on anything. A lot of other studios seem to be pretty transparent about what they're working on but I've not really seen anything from Mega Crit Games.
It's very good but that art style did it no favors. I kept pushing it way because it looked so very cheap IMO.
Well they WERE working on a new game...
Slay The (Ivory) Spire
    Hilarious...

And necessary
This but with 'they cancelled silksong'
I wouldn't think switching to a new game engine, after more than two years of development, would be only a few months task?
    It depends. Without knowing about the game, we can only speculate, but a project like Slay the Spire has a much larger design:implementation ratio than a lot of games.
        Yeah it really varies. I imagine a lot of the time will be upskilling and learning the new tech. Once you're familiar though things *can* (but not necessarily will) go faster if a lot of it is relatively directly translatable.
        Hopefully most of the complex stuff was done in a scripting language that can easily be ported over...
    i could see it being delayed by a year at least
        Yup, came to comment this. It could very easily be more than a year of porting and learning before getting to the same speed of development.
    This is the most optimistic comment I've seen on Reddit in years.

It most likely is a massive hurdle and it's not done with just migrating to a new engine, after that is it's learning the new engine *and* fixing all the issues that come from how the new engine works differently than Unity.
        Haha, well I was fairly certain it would be a much harder task, but as soon as you say something with certainty on Reddit (rather than phrasing it like a question like I did), someone comes along and says “well actually you can port an entire game from Unity to [Other engine] in literally one click” and then I looked dumb lol
            Hah, fair enough.

And I guess I did the same thing but in reverse, lol.  
My bad, hope I didn't come off full on "akSHuALly" with my reply, not my intention.
    In terms of computer science, it will vary a truly insane amount based on their practices. Depends how organized they are and how much they got done in two years, how much is concept vs "built"
    It varies mainly by how much their team knows the new engine. The reality of game dev is that a lot of your early code will be rewritten anyway.
    Unity won't go ahead with this because it's essentially illegal and will cause them to receive an unprecedented amount of legal action. They will have to backpedal from this stupid idea
    Yeah I'm worried that grandpa might be an idiot
This wouldn't be a few-months delay.  They'd basically need to start the entire project over.  They've been working on it for 2 years, so that's 2 years of work down the drain.
Remember, what radicalized Grandpa will be nothing to what radicalizes the grandchildren.
Yeah that's who I was thinking of. And that dev has so many downloads of his game on mobile, no? While hitting the revue cap on Steam. It was free on mobile last time I checked with ad support. Crazy how they will be punished for creating a game and releasing it as basically a passion project at a really low cost.
    And its on gamepass too, so they are really getting fucked over by the install fee.
Doesn't he build everything in the old engine, and then his team ports it over to Unity?

Seems like they could easily revert, but I know a lot of the effects probably rely on Unity.  

Wonder if they could port to another engine like Godot.
    The old engine is officially gone now with the latest update that adds the local co-op. The not-PC versions have always been Unity.
        Ahh, I see.  They have a good team, I'm sure they'll be fine whatever decision they make.
        Famous composer Tony Fox must be breathing a sigh of relief.

A lot of the fandom has wanted Toby to switch to Unity from GameMaker for a while just for the improved feature set, especially 60 FPS. There was even a project called UniTale to remake Undertale in Unity mostly for that 60 FPS.

He experimented in Unity for Deltarune but ultimately went with GameMaker which he knows back to front. I was disappointed at the time, but in retrospect that was a good decision. Especially considering he now has a small but full dev team to support.
Pump and dump. They just need to get some good numbers for a quarter or two after the new pricing kicks in and then sell off as much they can to someone who doesn't understand the long term implications.

        Is that not considered insider trading?
    Seems more like a hostile takeover to me instead, similar situation though. There's just very few other explanations other than ineptitude which I guess is usually the answer but god damn, that level of ineptitude?
>Silksong isn't happening anytime soon 

You could have just stopped there
Ya…. I’m afraid Silksong is toast.

It’s likely only months away…. But I don’t know how that game gets released. Especially since it will lead to a resurgence of downloads of Silksong and that alone will likely cost the team millions.

I don’t know….. what a shitty situation for everyone involved
    [removed]
        You can't migrate from unity in "months".  They'd basically need to restart the entire project.
        Man I remember playing Hollow Knight years ago thinking Silksong was already out and that I should buy it to give it a try. What the heck?
            What do you mean? I thought Silksong was already out?
                Just a few more months
        Migrating away from Unity would be years, not months
        Remember when it was 1 year (or less) away in the Xbox game show thing? Oof.
    lol in what world would this make silk song toast? they are still going to sell the game at this point, they have too much money and time sunk in to it to take a moral stance and rebuild in another engine.

they are going to sell 2M copies over its lifetime, and they are going to eat the unity fee because they are still going to make a boat load of money.
        You do realize the new fees could make that debt still
            for mobile games with low returns per user, yes, for a game with a $10+ buy-to-play model that expects hundreds of thousands or millions of sales, no. they'll have a pro or enterprise license, meaning the fee per install will range from 15 cents to 1 cent as they pass each threshold within that monthly period (1 cent at 1M+ downloads with enterprise).

there are many reasons this install fee system is an abysmal idea, but it's not going to put a game like silksong in any financial danger
                My guess is Silksong is also gonna be like $25-30

Edit: and it should be, I'd even pay $40-50 for it tbh
                    Hollow Knight is a $60 game for sure. I have more hours in HK than I do in Mario Odyssey
            No they don't. You don't realize the scale of the fee compared to the revenue they'll have 

I did some quick calculation in another comment. Basically it's at max 2$ per sale for those BS fees (and likely smaller, that's counting 10 different devices install before the game pass 1M installs which will take a few hours at most). That's not gonna make a game like Silksong lose money. Plus that's for the free tier of Unity. I doubt a studio like Team Cherry (or Mega Crit) is using this after the success of their first games, they have lower royalties on pro licenses

The problem is far more for the small indies that are already not profitable or barely than for those big games that at worst will lose some of their huge profits. But it's important they speak out because they get more attention than random indie studios nobody knows.
            hollow knight sold ~2m units and Team Cherry has 3 people. silk song will sell at least that over its lifetime. if these fees somehow make them go in to debt they deserve it for their gross negligence.
                Silksong is also day 1 Game Pass, which is going to add a ton of installs, but no sales no counteract the fees. Anything hitting any of GP/PS+ is hit extra hard by the new model.
                    Apparently gamepass installs are (somehow) going to be billed to Microsoft. Good luck collecting on that lmao
                        Lmao I am hoping to see them \*try\* to bill Microsoft for that. Microsoft will be more than happy to play that legal game if Unity wants to.
                    [deleted]
                        Good luck on them trying to get any money from Microsoft who have no contract/agreement with Unity at all.
                it is per install. with free bundles, game pass, people redownloading the game it can easily take all that money
                    Look, I think this new model is shitty and Unity deserves to go down in flames over this, but to be fair, Unity clarified that redownloads won't be counted and that devs won't be paying for Game Pass downloads. If they're selling the game for more than 20 cents a copy they won't be losing money on this. There's certainly enough to be outraged about elsewhere.
                        they also have no plans on how to do this, dispite saying it I don't trust them one bit
                            You're totally right. Unity's "trust us, bro, we know how to count installs fair and square, just don't ask us how" is super shady, and of questionable legality at best.

Meanwhile Unreal is out there saying "oh yeah we go based off your self-reported revenue. We trust you."
    After the success of Hollow Knight you assume that Team Cherry is not using the free Unity license

Pro/enterprise Unity licenses pay much less per install only after a much higher ceiling of earnings
        They would still easily be paying over 10k per month with the Pro tier. Likely more seeing as Silksong is highly anticipated, not at all a tiny new IP that miraculously got 2.5m+ in sales.
            And they would be paying extra fees when people redownload hollow Knight to replay it
                No it's just for the first install on a new device. They've changed that. So it's likely only when changing machines (I guess motherboard, that's what identify a PC right?)
                    They have failed tell mew machines apart before and have every reason to keep failing
                    Or you know, a bad actor running a farm of virtual machines with spoofed hardware IDs and IPs could run a script to continuously install on unique "new" devices to rack up a huge bill for the devs.
                        I mean that's going to a long way just to troll someone and no gain for yourself...
                            Sure is, but when you're popular enough you're inevitably going to attract people who are angry enough and bored enough with the technical knowhow who would jump at the chance to do something like this. Maybe the devs nerf their favorite playstyle, or take the game in an unpopular direction, or maybe they're just mad the game lets you select pronouns or something. I wouldn't underestimate how far some people would go over spite.
            [deleted]
                The math some people have done on the new costs are crazy. Some of the best case scenarios for a *successful* game that costs money and has a moderate player base is around 15%, or triple what Unreal costs *at most*. And there are situations where Unity can cost even more.

Also there's a whole thing of Unity saying distributors will be the ones owing for some cases, like Game Pass, which means there are going to be more headaches because that's questionable legality in the first place.


There are some whose livelihoods depends on what they're working on releasing on time to certain success, but there are tons of devs, universities, etc. already dropping Unity and there's no way I can imagine to win anyone back
                    Unity's whole deal is that it's much cheaper than Unreal for a less powerful engine. If it's not even cheaper, why in the world would a dev ever use it again?
                        Unity is also better in ease of use, better for mobile development and is better suited for non-3d games than Unreal is. Those are pretty key areas if you are a small indie dev team trying to push, let's say a 2d rougelike card game or an atmospheric 2d metroidvania game with hand drawn sprites to a variety of platforms. That isn't to say there is no alternative to Unity, but Unreal is probably not the go to answer for many devs, especially those who are speaking out the most currently.
            10k per month is nothing when you do 500k par month (just random numbers), all is relative. Those big indies or companies using Unity won't have much of a risk there I think. It's for the smaller ones (many indies games are not profitable or barely) that it's a problem
    Let's calm down the hysteria a bit. Not going to say Unity isn't shitty for how they're trying to roll this out but Silk Song isn't going to be scrapped after being developed for 6+ years because Unity will implement a fee. These guys are probably on the pro version of Unity which lowers the license fee and the game is going to sell millions. Team Cherry will make millions and be fine.
Oh my god.

If Silksong is delayed or cancelled because of it there will be literal riots.

(Well, online riots. People will definitely be upset)
    It can't be delayed since it never gave a release date lol
If this causes Silksong to be delayed further, I will not be impressed. Obviously with the Unity idiots, not Team Cherry. Give me Silksong already.
Silksong will not lose money, it'll eat into their profits as it'll be massively successful. Or not even, it's not like they announced a price so they can just include this into the sale price they decide. 

The "new version" (which IMO was always the one they intended to do but made a worse one to make it look better) is 20 cents for the first install on a new device and then 2 cents after 1M installs (which Silsong will pass day 1 basically). 

Realistically, you can expect each sale to get what? max 10 different devices "first install" lifetime (some more, some less of course). So that's between 20 cents and 2 dollars for those BS fees to Unity on a sale. If they raise their intended price by 1$ (not happy about it but let be honest, the ultimate payer in the end is always the customer), it's covering this bullshit for sure.  

And thankfully, they excluded subscriptions installs so they won't get fucked by the game being on Gamepass (well Microsoft should pay they said but good luck with that lol)

The problem is far more for the small indies that are already not profitable or barely than for those big games that at worst will lose some of their huge profits. But it's important they speak out because they get more attention than random indie studios nobody knows.

I still don't understand how Unity took such a dumbass decision that'll end up killing their company. Like if they needed money (their financials are pretty bad apparently), they could have just raised their already existing royalties prices I assume (I don't know much how they work on Unity, more familiar with Unreal)
>unbelievable that they would remove their TOS from their Github. incredibly scummy.

Very possibly illegal too
this would mean nothing, when you have something like genshin impact or pokemon in your engine
    Genshin isn't going to be covered under this change so it does mean something. Also, among games that are difficult to port to a new engine Pokemon Go is not one of them.
        Considering Unity straight up removed the clause that protected you from new TOS by running old versions, that might be their way in to at least attempt to go for Genshin. I am almost certain it won't work because a) MiHoYo is a chinese studio and foreigners don't enjoy many legal protections over there and b) pulling the TOS rug like that is illegal in many countries, including the entirety of the EU. 

This move, if someone with some money chooses to fight, could break Unity not only in reputation, but also legally and financially. I am not a lawyer, but the things I know about consumer protection laws hint at this outcome.
            Genshin isn't covered because they have a different license that excludes them from the changes made by Unity Technologies. So even if it was legal to go after other developers, it wouldn't affect Chinese developers either way.
            >This move, if someone with some money chooses to fight, could break Unity not only in reputation, but also legally and financially

Let's try Disney, Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, Valve, Epic, CDPR, Humble Bundle, EA, Blizzard, The Pokemon company and more. Unity will no longer exist if they try to enforce this on them. Microsoft could just buy Unity outright and shut them down out of spite.
            >  MiHoYo is a chinese studio and foreigners don't enjoy many legal protections over there 

Doesn't matter. Once they set foot in US jurisdiction, they have to obey US law. So they would be sued in US court.

Unless they decide to exit the US market, which I don't think will happen.
            >MiHoYo is a chinese studio and foreigners don't enjoy many legal protections over there and b) pulling the TOS rug like that is illegal in many countries, including the entirety of the EU. 

Then thier income based on Android and Apple store can get fucked. Yea the company can do thing but its money from the West would be held.
        Niantic doesn't have a great history for games they try to port to a new engine. Pokemon Go might be lucky enough to survive that given the IP, but yeah...
        Pokemon go was not the pokemon i was referencing
            Then which? The mainline games and Masters use a proprietary engine, Go is simple and portable if the cost of the engine goes up, and Unite is not affected by this change.
                The remakes of diamond and pearl are on unity
                    And it's not even the only Nintendo IP affected. Guess what FE Engage was developed in.
                        oh boy right I remember that
                Pokémon Brilliant Diamond And Shining Pearl
                    Those games are already released though right? It just means nintendo couldn't do updates to them anymore, and I wouldn't expect them to anyways.
                        This situation affects games already released. So no not updating them does nothing.
                            That seems... totally insane and unenforceable if that's true. The game was already published under the old license. I don't understand how they could try to change the contract agreement on an already developed and published game. It seems... Impossible? Like if there was active development and updates for a game I could see how they could try to collect those fees, but otherwise I don't see how that's possible.
                                Well yeah it is insane and thats why everyone is up in arms
                            It's true that the new pricing structure applies to previously released games. However I think it's highly likely that for something as big as the Pokemon games, they made an individual license agreement with Unity ahead of time. Big companies like that don't just create an account on Unity's website and subscribe to a few Pro version seats. They workout their own licensing deals for the engine. This new pricing scheme won't apply to their games.
    I would also bet the big games like that and hearthstone are getting their own custom deals.

No way would they risk their big dogs.
        Will have to see because it wasnt a risk before right.
            Acti-blizz legal doesn't fuck around like that. They'll have a custom license.
            The sourcing and contract people at my much smaller company wouldn't allow a contract that doesn't have pricing set in very solid stone. Pretty much every contract we have is custom. 

There is no way a large company like blizzard or Nintendo wouldn't have a custom contract.
                They'll be sued into the stone age by Microsoft since they plan to charge them, a company they do not have a contract with, fees per game install. They are outright delusional.
    There is zero chance either of those games is using the shrink-wrap license, even at the highest tier. They almost certainly have a negotiated agreement that won't be subject to this fuckery.
Not a real question. I don't even need to read their TOS to know they will have a caveat in all their documents stating they can change anything in the contract at will, with little to no notice.
    You can right whatever you write in a TOS it doesn't mean it's legal or enforceable.
    Just because you put something into a contract doesn't mean it's legal to put in a contract. As a hypothetical, if the contract said Unity had the right to kill your first-born child, they wouldn't actually have that right.

I'm not a lawyer so I do not want to speak on whether or not what they've actually done is legal.
        Always with the extremes LOL.

Pretty cut and dry my dudes. People messaging me here like they've never read a contract in their life. It's the same with the Unreal Engine. It's their property, they can do what they want with it.
            Yes, I used an extreme hypothetical to illustrate the point. That was the entire point of my comment. I'm not here to refute what is or isn't in the contract. I'm saying that just because it's there does not mean it's legally enforceable. A contract isn't some magic spell that lets you do anything you want to. You're responding to the question of "is this legal to do" with the idea that it's in the contract, and that's simply not a legitimate answer.
            I don't think you understood what people were telling you. There are authorities above Unity that will enforce their own rules, no matter what the contract says. For example, if you make an online store in Europe and on your ToS you say "by buying in this store you waive your right to refund within 14 days", it doesn't matter. You still have to refund people if they ask you to or they can take you to court in Europe and you will lose. 

So what the other posters were saying is that *if* retroactively applying a ToS is illegal in certain places, then it doesn't matter that they added that clause in it.
    Pretty sure that is not legal.
> The real question is, it it even LEGAL for Unity to do this retroactively?

It's legal if they say so
Why can’t a company say they changed their mind, starting in 90 days the price is going up? It happens all the time
    [deleted]
        So you’re saying the law should change and business to business contracts should require more notice? Or that this is the law now?
It's so well designed. I end up wishing other games were more like it.

Hades is great, but an ascension system instead of choosing Heat levels could be a better experience, with difficulty scaling in a curated way rather than giving you a list of options of what you want to try to cheese.

Diablo 4's usage of Vulnerable is so, so much worse than StS's. A flat percentage bonus to attack damage that you can also synergize with is powerful already, you don't need to make gear boost that percentage so it beats all other strategies.
My only complaint is that the visuals are pretty meh. But the gameplay is incredible.
(Mega Crit and Slay the Spire logos)

"The Mega Crit team has been hard at work these past 2+ years on a new game. But unlike with Slay the Spire, the engine we have been developing it in is Unity.

The retroactive pricing structure of Runtime Fees is not only harmful in a myriad of ways to developers--especially indies--it is also a violation of trust. We believe Unity is fully aware of this, seeing as they have gone so far as to remove their TOS from GitHub.

Despite the immense amount of time and effort our team has already poured into development on our new title, we will be migrating to a new engine unless the changes are completely reverted and TOS protections are put in place.

We have never made a public statement before. That is how badly you fucked up."
    Thanks so much for writing this all out!
That's why the mentioned that they will require "TOS Protections."

In other words, Unity needs to guarantee in contract that they cannot change the terms unilaterally later on.
Changing engines means abandoning years of custom inhouse tooling, losing all engine experience with your current staff and is a huge overall business cost.

No one WANTS to change to a new technical stack if they do not have to.
    With the direction Unity as a company is going, changing to a new technical stack is inevitable. The issues with Unity goes beyond them trying to nick and dime their customers, the entire company is becoming dumpster fire.

The warning signs have been there for years that Unity is not a horse you want to bet anymore on, yet these devs chose to ignore them. And even now they are refusing to stop betting on it.
        Agreed, but I'm not surprised that studios that are already knee deep in a project built in Unity are trying to push back for the short term. Mega Crit might have already 100% decided that they're not going to use Unity for any new projects, but they could have tens of thousands of work hours put into a current project, and trying to port it to a new engine now would very likely add thousands of more hours to it.

It's not the kind of switch that every studio is in a situation to make on a dime.
    For sure, but now they'll forever be wondering if they're risking their business by not doing so
        I don't think there will be any wondering at all. They are 100% not going to use unity for any other future projects, even if this runtime fee thing is completely rolled back.
Ultimately it's a business and they've already invested 2+ years into the game. An engine swap this far into development could be hard to justify financially.
They would only continue if the changes are reverted AND TOS protections are put into place. I'd still bet that even if they those changes were to happen, they'd still switch engines after finishing development of their current project. Once trust is broken like this, there's no going back only putting up with it as long as possible until you can make an easy break from it.
A lot of people aren't going to.  Damage is done.  Trust is lost.  Everyone knows these scum ass companies always try again in the future.
Godot, Unreal
Yes… I bet that is what the executives think they did.


But…. I really think that Unity is fucking dead. No publisher is going to touch Unity games with a 10 foot pole now (Divolver Digital has already alluded to this publicly, and you can bet every other publisher is thinking the same thing).

If your game has 0% chance of being picked up by a publisher, why would you even think about building it in Unity? 

Unity has about 3 years of new releases and any incumbents that they can milk for cash. And then that’s it. 

5 years from now Unity is going to be a dead company. Even if they backtrack…. Trust is gone.
    That's what happens after an IPO apparently lmao
        [removed]
Maybe some can switch to Gadot? It supports C#
    Supporting the same language is very useful for keeping existing internal logic, but any time you're talking to the engine's API's you mostly gotta rewrite that shit to fit the new engine.
        Oh yeah that could be a major issue, especially if not all API calls are 1:1 between engine.
The thresholds are low enough that it'll affect any half-decent indie team, not even mentioning the successful ones. The only part that it doesn't affect are bad games that people don't bother to play/spend money on.
What platform do you not have it on? Imagine a port to those stupid refrigerators with the screens. Lol
    I've always wanted to play games on Android Auto, personally
        "Hey siri. Buy more grandmas in cookie clicker."
    StS is the new Doom. Soon enough we'll see people doing A20 streaks on oscilloscopes and tamagotchis
The madlads actually made their first game in libgdx out of everything available, so honestly, I can believe they wouldn't take THAT long to get their stuff onto a new engine.
> May have to buy slay the spire on yet another platform to help em out.

Just remember to not install the game :)
    I know you're joking, but Slay the Spire is not made in Unity.
        Ah, you're correct. I forgot that part immediately after reading it. Thanks!
They aren't a giant publisher. These companies are made up of passionate people that pour countless hours of energy into a product that we all can enjoy.

Not every statement has to be some soulless litigation proof memorandum.
    I know that's why it's funny? They make it look like a PR statement and then end up with a fuck lol
        Ah, I thought you were trying to say the opposite.
I don't think they will back-pedal either, but they'll have to compromise somehow with how negative the reaction has been to the announcement. Not to mention it's not a few indie devs they're affecting here, motherfucking League of Legends use Unity, for example, how Unity is going through with this without a bunch of legal teams burning their ass is beyond me
    Genshin Impact, Marvel Snap, and Pokemon Go all run on Unity too, and I dunno who in their right mind would want to take on Hoyoverse, Disney, and Nintendo all at the same time.
        Yeah, they're fucked. This is going to be hilarious.
            I'm pretty sure Microsoft is on the list too. I think they claimed that fee's will be charged to the distributors, so unity games on GamePass. Or Microsoft just pulls Unity based games from their catalog, but time will tell.
                
>I think they claimed that fee's will be charged to the distributors

Which is fucking hysterical, because that means they're also going to try to charge Valve, Epic, EA, CDPR, Sony, Nintendo and a variety other storefronts as well. None of whom have contracts with them. They apparently *want* to be sued by everyone under the sun.

I don't think they even consulted a lawyer, this is so blatantly illegal I'm shocked that they thought this was a good idea.
                    Well consider the CEO was trh same EA guy who had bright ideas such as making the player pay money to repair their in-game car and generally made EA look like the greediest, worst gaming company and it starts making sense.

Why a clown like that is still in such a high ranked highly paid position is still baffling
                        >Why a clown like that is still in such a high ranked highly paid position is still baffling

He apparently sold off stock like a week or two ago before dropping this. He might end up being investigated by financial regulators at the end of this lol.

Rich people have benefits us lowly workers don't have, including the advantage of failing your way upwards.
                    Yeah, when devs started asking Unity folks how things like gamepass would work with this, the response they got from management was basically "Well we're going to have to sit down and have some discussions with the subscription services about it."

I didn't go to business school, so maybe I'm way off base here, but maybe you should've had those conversations and figured all of this out with the relevant parties before you announce a major change that you say is going to go into effect 4 months from now. 

Microsoft/Valve/Epic/Sony/Apple/Nintendo/etc. are all going to tell Unity to go pound sand if asked to cough up a payment per install. They don't want to have to track that stuff for a third party company, and at this point, there's no way any of them are going to want to wade into this mess on Unity's side.
                        Great point. Did they really think the platform holders would be all chill with this?
                Microsoft owns Obsidian now I think, who made Pillars of Eternity 1 & 2 with Unity.
                    The Ori games are Unity as well, perhaps even the new game that Moon Studios is working on?

I think Hearthstone is Unity as well? So ActiBlizz also in the boat
        Don't forget Microsoft, EA, and Sony. Plus you can probably include Valve, Apple, and Google, as they're the ones distributing the games and thus the ones that somehow need to track unique installs.
        You think they don't know this? This is exactly the companies they are going for, the indies are just a nice extra. Unity also has a lot of money, and at some point more money doesn't help you in legal battles. Courts have to decide this, although I have high hopes that this won't fly in europe at all.
        All of them with get special exclusive deals that eliminate the fees
    All of Hoyoverse's popular games use Unity, as well. And they have enough fuck you money to get into a massive legal battle over this if they wanted.
        And that money will presumably get backup from the plumber's ninjas and the Mouse's legal team. All Unity has done here is given everyone else a target, ironically causing unity in the process.
    Wild Rift you mean? I think League on PC runs a variation of some big rigs engine or some shit.
    > I don't think they will back-pedal either,

They already did a little bit. Mostly about re-installs. But most people didn't hear about it because they didn't update their official pages on this and as Mega Crit mentioned, the trust has already been broken.
Sadly not many great alternatives.
    Unreal has always been a strong contender, and I've heard good things about Godot as well. Honestly Godot might be the biggest winner coming out of all this.
        People also sleep on Game Maker. Games like Hotline Miami, Hyper Light Drifter, and Undertale were made with it. It's a *very* capable engine if smaller scale, 2D stuff is what a dev team is going for.
        Godot doesn't have real console support without doing it yourself completely which is why it's not viable for a lot of smaller devs. Unreal is more high end option that is not always suitable for smaller teams.
>I see no reason why any indie dev would go near Unity even if they back-pedalled completely  

If you are small indie dev (basically solo) and arent trying to make f2p game. There is no reason why not. Most games dont earn even close that much money. Currently learning about Unity myself, wouldnt mind paying 20% from 200k IF i would hit it big (but most likely will not happen).
    It's not 20%. That would be steep, but within the realms of reason. Or at least the realms of, well, reality.

It's $0.20 per install. Not per sale, per *install*. There are so many problems with tacking it to installs rather than sales that it's difficult to fully get it across. Just for starters though, imagine someone bought your game, and then paid for a botnet to install said game on 10,000 devices. Now imagine they bought your cheap game 100 times and installed on each device 100 times.

Someone spent maybe a grand at most on a botnet and 100 copies of your game, and now you owe $200,000 to Unity. As a small indie dev, you're probably bankrupt and whatever internet troll you pissed off is laughing his ass off.

And this is assuming that Unity somehow manages to put together a decent enough install detection system that means you need to actually buy the game and have a botnet to do this. More realistically, their methods for detecting installs will by shoddy, and one guy who bought your game and doesn't care for it much might be able to spoof thousands of installs a day on their computer with a simple VPN and a script.
        >It's $0.20 per install. Not per sale, per install.  

I know, I just went with worst assumption in mind (basically sale for 1 game for 1$). Unity said, that they wouldnt make pay for re-install (for same game) AND that they would check for bad actors (how the hell, they will do that, that is a very fucking good question).  

>And this is assuming that Unity somehow manages to put together a decent enough install detection system that means you need to actually buy the game and have a botnet to do this.  

Yes, would love to see how they will implement this.  
I can see this being fine, if using Steam (or any of big launchers), but will see. Either way this is a big L for Unity and its community.
            > Unity said, that they wouldnt make pay for re-install

You'd still need to pay per device though. If someone buys your $1 game and installs it on their PC, their laptop, their phone, their work PC, and their friend's PC, suddenly you owe Unity 100% of that sale. Then they get a new PC and a new phone a year later and suddenly you're losing money on each game.
                >If someone buys your $1 game and installs it on their PC, their laptop, their phone, their work PC, and their friend's PC, suddenly you owe Unity 100% of that sale.  

Yeap, that is the super bad scenario :( Thats why waiting for more info. But it still would require those 200k profit and 200k installs. So at worst, can stop selling game when you get close to 200k sales (if sale is 1$).  
This will hit mobile, f2p markets the most.
    > Currently learning about Unity myself, wouldnt mind paying 20% from 200k IF i would hit it big

  Ok bro, except you probably wont. Stop simping for unity...
        Mate, I literally said that I most likely wouldnt.  
I am just saying that if you are solo dev then these changes dont matter for more than 90% of users. Rarely you will see solo dev with 200k in revenue and 200k installs in a year.
    Even if this particular change wouldn't affect you, what would stop Unity from changing the terms again? They have shown that they are willing to fuck their users over.
There's no way they don't backpedal, they're angering some of the major players with this BS, and this ensures all short and long term revenue dries up since nobody wants to make games under these harsh terms.
The original license meant people could use the mechanics of D&D to make their own games and settings. It also allowed people to make money from the games they created with their new settings/games. This is how the first version of pathfinder came about.

They were going to change the license to retroactively claim the rights to any content created on the old terms. This would allow WotC to use it however they wanted without permission or payment. Also they wanted to start making companies using the ogl hand over a large percentage of any money made. Not profit just revenue.

They were basically trying to put their competitors out of business and seize control of the IPs they created. I believe that Wizards backed down completely and put the original OGL in a creative commons license in the end.
I want to expand the fantastic answer given by /u/Ok-Discount3131 : 

In the aftermath, the publisher of the competing tabletop system Pathfinder (which basically has its roots in DnD 3e, and thus is also considered at least partly to be OGL content) decided on the radical step of remastering the current second edition of the game to not include **any** content under the OGL anymore.

That means they will remove monsters, races even names of magic spells that come even close to what Wizards made. (they'll replace them with their own versions)

This is because they have no choice - Wizards demonstrated that they are a bad actor here and can never be trusted anymore. The same thing will happen with Unity: **the trust is permanently broken** and you absolutely can't build your own business on trusting them anymore.
    Worth also adding on top of this, they made their own ogl equivalent in response, [ORC](https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sico?). They made sure to make it completely irrevocable.
It's a top 3 roguelite for sure.
    isaac, spelunky, and spire are the holy trinity for me.
        FTL too
            FTL will always be number one in my heart
                For as much as I love FTL I sure am terrible at it.
                    I think it's one of the hardest roguelikes without being unfun, theres a lot going on in it, both mechanically and in decision making.
                    I thought being terrible at it was the point. Are you telling me people are good at it? Unthinkable.

Oh, my crew got spaced again.
                    Use pause a lot more, for example pause before missle impact and turn on cloak
                I remember the first time I played FTL. I downloaded it at like 7 PM and figured I would play for a couple of hours and call it a night. When I lifted my head from the game it was 4 AM.
            I unfortunately find the end game of FTL painfully unsatisfying and restrictive. The perfect game is a heavily modded FTL where the player's power level outscales the original game by degrees, and has challenges to match.

Of course the best of those also tell you the final challenges ahead of time, and Oh Hey, that's a Slay the Spire thing. Game so good it fixes other good games.
            What about Streets of Rouge?
        No dead cells?! Your subjective opinion is wrong!
            Sorry /u/DeadCellsTop5 the best I can do is 6th place
                Wrong! Lol. I actually have dead cells as my #4 game on my top 25 all-time list. I fucking love that game. I've got Slay the Spire at #9 on the same list, so I fucking love that game too.
                    Would you share your top 25 list? I’m curious. Thanks

My rule is only one game per series is allowed, otherwise it's too repetitive with multiple from the same franchise. It's also always changing. This is where I'm at now, though. Not a big RPG guy, nor a Nintendo guy.
                            Your lack of Metal Gear Solid representation is disturbing
            Personally I'd like it more if it forced the player to react to builds more, react to rng. Even with all items unlocked it's not too hard to end up at similar setups in back to back runs, especially with how powerful shops are, let alone with Wish. And the boring stat system ensures you've already committed to a stat before the end of the first level. It is great fun to get in the zone and not drop balanced blade stacks throughout an entire biome, and bosses can be fun in the Goldilocks zone between the struggle bus and instantly vaporizing them with things like baseball bat or half of tactics.

My favorite roguelite currently is Against the Storm by contrast, where playing at a high level is defined by how well you react to the hand you're dealt. StS is also like this at a high level, though some archetypes become near impossible to build past a15.

Edit: To summarize, Dead Cells is a fine action 2d platformer, and not a great roguelite for me.
                I second Against the Storm, it's a mix of a roguelike with the old city builders (Caesar/Pharaoh) where you can actually lose which makes it more appealing than say Two Point Campus where you eventually just win.  Add in the fact that no game feels the same and it's easily one of my picks of this decade.
                    I've tried the Against the Storm demo a couple of times and can't get into it? Which is sad because rougelites and city builders are my two favourite genres. Did it take a while for it to 'click' for you?
                        It took me a few games to get it to click (like ignore house locations etc) but once the difficulty starts ramping up it has a great gameplay loop.  I'd say it's more old school builder (theme hospital,caesar 3) rather than cities skylines as you're building around the disasters/resources rather than making a nice looking city.  I personally have 221 hours in it so far.
                can you define roguelite for me? feels like we've lost the plot when a city builder is a roguelite.
                    How about:

A game where you perform a series of "runs" where each run has a significant amount of randomness. Each run is challenging and failure/death may frequently end the run unsuccessfully. Often, roguelites have some kind of meta-progression between runs. Roguelites are intended to be played many times, rather than once and done, since a lot of content or progression is only unlocked after multiple runs.

Against the Storm is clearly a roguelite imo.
                        I would also add that each run isn't particularly long. I think for me, most "runs" when learning cap out at 35 minutes or so. Once I am good at them, under 25 or under 20.
                        is tropico a roguelite? randomness, runs, meta progression, gated content.
                            I don't think tropico has the same level of randomness (you can build any/all the same buildings every time, maps and events are handmade for campaign mode) nor is failure/death a significant threat. There also is no progression if you fail. It's just a regular campaign game. Frequent failure is a core part of the experience of roguelites.
                    I would define a roguelite as: short run/round/map-focused gameplay, start from scratch each run, high variance in equipment/cards/enemies/objectives/strategy each run, after each run you have meta progression for the next run. Against the storm and slay the spire ticks all these boxes.
                    Against the Storm is undoubtedly a roguelite haha, I don't care to quibble about this. It's a roguelite first, the towns you build are extremely temporary in nature, the city-building nature plays second fiddle to the fact that all your buildings and decisions are meant to win the map, not raise a mighty city or empire.
            Can't forget Hades
            Always feel like I'm taking crazy pills because I did not like Dead Cells at all. I play tons of roguelites and Dead Cells would be towards the bottom of the rankings. I found nothing about the game engaging.
                Boy, you crazy! Nah, it's all personal opinion, so it doesn't matter. I find the combat so incredibly satisfying. It's quick, it's snappy, it's predictable. I LOVE the dodge roll and how your can dodge cancel out of nearly any animation. I honestly think it's the best 2D action game out there because the combat is damn near perfect. Then the biomes are all distinct with their own enemy types and the ng+ modes add so much to an already stellar game. Then throw in all of the build possibilities with all the weapons and the multiple branching pathways and it's like roguelite heaven for me.
                    See that's the weird thing, my biggest complaint is that I didn't like the combat. Maybe if I unlocked more stuff I would have enjoyed it more - that is kind of a common gripe with roguelites. But yeah the combat from the handful of hours I played just bored me.
                        Man, that's crazy to me. That combat is incredible. Pretty much every review praises it. I've never seen anyone complain about the combat before. You should give it another shot, or at least watch some gameplay from a streamer or someone deeper in the game. The weapon variety is insane too.
                            The weapon variety at least at the start of the game seemed really limited. And maybe I just don't actually like 2d action combat lol.
            No Dead Cells and no Hades. 

Hades, Dead Cells and Slay the Spire is the trinity of roguelikes IMO. FTL if it's a quatuor
        Enter the Gungeon is clearly the best and it's not even close. This discussion make me realise how many amazing roguelites there are, wow!
            I was going to say the same! Enter the Gungeon on a hypothetical "best roguelite games" list would be the top if not real close to it. The game is just so damn charming on top of some highly addicting gameplay.
                I love the game but it’s too f’ing hard for me. Took me 70 hrs to beat the Dragun and that was with a Sir Junkan lucky but cheesy strat. It was just too hard to get enough time on the lower levels. I didn’t put serious time after the large expansion/patch they did but heard it got balanced a bit smoother.

Edit: also played it on Switch which may have had something to do with it. I was shocked at how much better a Hades player I was on a 144 hz monitor at high res.
        And Monster Train, I think the only card roguelite I really liked. There is Erannorth Chronicles but that one is more sandbox than roguelite.
        Noita is #1 for me but inno what 2 and 3 are
        Risk of Rain 2
There are some games I have more fun with, but I genuinely think StS is a perfectly designed game. It's got insane depth at higher levels while not bogging everything down. It's just so clean.
    Something that I think STS got right is how difficult it is to play defensively. I like Pirates Outlaws and Dawncaster more than STS, but both of those games made defending easier. The problem is that defensive strats are significantly easier than offensive ones; if you take one big hit, you have to expend resources to recover that could be spent elsewhere. If your deck is defensive and kills opponent gradually without taking damage, you can spend your resources on something else, adding up significantly over the course of a run.
I've played a ton of similar games and none of them have StS's replay value. They all lack it's sheer fun factor, even if they have more depth to them. I've gotten A20 with all the characters and I still load it up here and there.
    Have you beaten the heart with all 4 though? That shit can make a man lose his damn mind lol
        Baalorlord (one of the top StS players) said something along the lines of A10 Heart being harder than A20 without Heart. I'm not sure how much I agree with it but it's definitely a massive step up to fight the Heart on any ascension. It's a very befitting boss as the ultimate test of your deck.
            Heart is just ridiculous. You can have a deck that absolutely crushes everything, including the boss before the heart, only to get wiped by the heart in 3 turns. It can be very deflating. Still haven't beaten it with the watcher
                Watcher is a tricky character to play but once you get the hang of her you'll realize she's way stronger than the initial three. She came later and didn't get quite as much balancing, to the point people say she's like a fan made character. The most consistent way to play her is to stance dance, to the point if all you're doing is taking absolutely no cards in Act 1 except Talk to the Hand, Mental Fortress, Tantrum (if you haven't upgraded Eruption yet), 1 Inner Peace or Fear No Evil, and Rushdown and you'll build an infinite which can brute force a win in a small number of attempts.
                    I once watched Jorbs go unreasonably far in a Watcher A20 run taking zero cards to make a point. The biggest mistake people make with Watcher is not realizing how strong her starting deck is and adding a bunch of junk to it.
                    Watcher being the strongest character is exactly what leads to Watcher runs primarily fizzling at the Heart battle.

Even infinites can fail against heart if you don't find passive block generation as you are forced to tank a LOT of damage across the first three turns no matter what.
                    I don't think it's that they didn't balance it as much, it's that her main mechanic of Wrath is one of these things where it's either broken or it feels very bad and not that fun, and they'd rather have Watcher be fun for the average player even if she ends up broken for A20 players.
                lifecoach1981 is currently doing 50 watcher wins in a row on twitch, sitting on 21 right now. maybe you can learn some tricks there (asc 20 ofc) - but be warned, some runs take 8 hours..
                    Ages ago when he was a Hearthstone pro he was called "ropecoach" because he always used the maximum turn time to think (the ending countdown is visualized by a rope that burns across the screen)

Looks like some things never change...
                        People still meme about him in Hearthstone even though he hasn't been playing the game for like 5 years.
                    Is he beating the heart every time? I've beaten the game with the watcher, just not the heart
                        Yes, a win = ASC20 including heart. Is at 22 in a row now, just finished his latest run an hour ago :)
                Heart isn't the biggest problem. The problem is the last path towards it. Starts with a resting site which is useless there in terms of healing because you'll heal all the way after the boss anyway. So you can either upgrade one card or if you're lucky and have the relics either get another relic or get more HP. All of these are mostly useless there. Then a merchant, then that Miniboss with the two attacking sides. Those two are already massively dangerous and I mostly go out of that fight with half health. And with that sliver to survive the heart is almost impossible. Would be a whole lot easier if the resting site came after the miniboss.
                I beat the very first heart fight i ever did with the silent, had that relic that revives with 50% HP and forgot about it, also had Fairy in a bottle lol, literally died twice to win, crazy fight.

I beat the boss before the heart in like 4 turns.

It was a Bullet Time, Runic Pyramid run where i would draw 10 cards every turn and Snecko Skull applying like 50 poison per turn, very fun
                Pro tip: To help beat the Heart with Watcher, "see a Talk to the Hand, take a Talk to the Hand"
            Eyy, another Baalorlord enjoyer! I kind of agree with him, tbh. I've got to A20 on every character, but I'm only up to A5 with heart kills (so I can't speak to his exact statement about A10 heart, unfortunately). Act 4 requires different tactics than the rest of the game, to some extent, so building a deck to do it all is an extra challenge.
                What I'm not sure I agree with is how much higher is the jump in difficulty. I'm not sure it's as high as 10 ascensions. That said, he has like 6k more hours than me and the last time I touched A10H was when I was climbing ascensions, so I don't have a good reference to what not fighting the Heart feels like since I always prepared for it.
                    Ahh, gotcha! Yeah, I did a climb to 20 first to adjust to the new mechanics at each level before I went into dedicated heart kills. I got a couple here and there on runs I felt were going well, but now I'm counting it as my win condition to ascend.
                    I've beaten A20H on all 4 characters multiple times and I dropped down to A10 for fun. I am way more successful at A10H than I am at even getting out of act 2 on A20 lol. Maybe I just suck, but I'd guess for me it'd be like A20 is easier than A17H
        Nah, not on A20
    >Even if they have more depth to them

What on earth are you smoking that you think there are multiple other games that have more depth than slay the spire? The level of depth, especially going for the heart on a20 is as deep of a strategy game as there is out there.
    Slay the Spire then becomes stupidly better with Downfall. It's like every single one of the best modders came together to make Slay the Spire 2.

I consider Marisa a base game character too. One of the best designed standalone ones. They actually have some custom logic just for ger cards in Downfall.
        I'll check it out. Never played any mods or anything.
    I've also hit A20 and after struggling for a million years to try and beat it, I just started playing custom games for fun.

Shit reinvirgorated the game for me and I have hundreds of hours. Screwing around in the game is as fun as trying hard IMO.
it is. there's lots of imitators and they're fun in their own way but StS has that perfect ratio of RNG and consistency that makes it perfect.
It’s what got my gf hooked on gaming. We play a round before bed almost every night
It’s a game that fits perfectly that niche between deckbuilding, dungeon crawling, and gambling.

One of the very few games I’ve replayed until the end many times. Currently on my third run to A20 all classes: did it on PC eons ago, Xbox when it hit Game Pass, and on my phone now that it’s on Apple Arcade.
    Is the iOS port any good? The Android one is terrible. Still the same game, but poorly executed. Cards are sticky, so you wind up playing cards you were trying to read if you're not really careful. Not using Save and Quit can result in your run getting deleted entirely when your phone moves STS out of RAM. Etcetera.
        It's pretty good. I run into the sticky card problem sometimes and it's worse on iPhone because sometimes you pull up the notification center screen and it minimizes the game. It's a UX issue.

Other than that, performance wise, it's great. STS never crashed, I've never ran into the save issue, STS never locked my phone. FWIW I have an iPhone 14 Pro, but I think it runs great on older phones, as long as it isn't an iPhone SE or an X.
    What about the heart, though?
        A20 Heart is way too hard. I don’t have the skill to do that. I’ll leave to the pros and streamers. :(
Its very very good, but I might stop just short of "perfect". There are just enough little things I could imagine being better: difficulty gap between the easist and hardest elites, the extreme difficulty spikes in the A-teens, writhing mass being added to the game.

Its not like you can "just fix it" though. I stopped playing for a few years and after i came back, Silent has Blade Dance buffed and one of the discard cards became uncommon and just those 2 changes basically made it a totally different class. This type of game is insanely hard to develop so the fact its so good is crazy.
The slow unlock process at the start keeps it from being perfect in my opinion.

I played it years ago and was bored as hell because all my runs were just playing Attack Attack Attack Block Block Block. I think I got to the second boss a few times then just stopped playing because it was so bland.

Wasn't until I got a Steam Deck that I gave it another go, and found that I'd stopped just before I started unlocking some interesting synergies with new cards. Now I'm interested, but I could have been hooked immediately if it actually started this way.


Lot of games seem to want to imitate Binding of Isaac these days, in that they hide most of their content until you've beaten a few runs. But BoI still had a large pool of items even from the very start.
    I found the game Vault of the Void to have a much better take on this, where every single starting deck had no generic "Attack" and "Block" cards, they all had some other effect or nuance, which in some cases were pretty major.
        Sounds interesting, I'll give it a look!
    I tried to get the last rogue unlock several times and each time after completing a run and seeing that I still needed lots of runs I just "nope" and deleted the game...

RNG is pretty wild, and you have close to no way with controlling it. I like roguelites which have some unlocking over time mechanics of rerolling offers or bumping chances of specific buff/card classes. It feels good when you finished the game few times, get some upgrade to force some build and try out different builds, instead here you're forced to play whatever you're getting on each run.
        If you haven't tried Vault of the Void yet, definitely give it a look. I got into it precisely because you can straight-up start some of the fun gimmicky builds instead of having to build up to them from a boring attack/block deck.
        Oh boy… Maybe you should give it more time. At a high level, almost every class can go infinite with their deck rather consistently whether it be infinite damage,block,energy etc. So saying that you’re forced to play with whatever you’re getting when in actual fact the high level play revolves around 1 kind of deck reveals how little you’ve played.
            No, it's not about "forced to play", rather, I usually wanna play some specific build and have some tools to force rng to be more likely to give me needed cards/artifacts/etc. Like, I know that rogue can go into shiv build(and almost auto lose if floor 3 boss is that fucker with 12 cards reset mechanics), the usual draw/discard build(I think last time I beat with that) and with poison. I just want to play poison with that double poison card, but sadly it's locked by lots of runs, which I'd have to play without it, which isn't something I'd want to do.
    I like what some other games in the genre have done with starting cards. In STS, your starting cards are bad and you're better off removing them.

Pirates Outlaws gives every class at least one card in their starting deck that's actively great for the class's direction. Classes that are unlocked later are given some pretty wild starter decks that push them in directions that the simpler classes could never go in (for example, the Cursed Captain gets a card that discards all his curses and redraws and the Fortune Teller starts with a Curse that makes all her other cards more powerful while it's in hand).

Dawncaster made it really interesting. Each class has one or two colors, a set of basic attacks, a set of weapon abilities (passives and/or an ability that can be activated for an effect between battles), and a list of cards that you start the game with one of in your deck. You pick one of each (you get 8 copies of the basic attack). Most of them synergize in one way or another (ex. The Rogue has a basic attack that inflicts poison if chained, a weapon power that heals them whenever an enemy takes poison damage, and a starting card that increases how much damage poison inflicts per trigger). Some of them interact in crazy ways; the Hunter has a basic attack where each copy records how much damage its dealt that battle and adds it to its current damage that dovetails deliciously with a starting card that returns cards from your discard pile.

These games make it feel like you have some kind of build from the very first fight, where in STS you're often only partway there by the end of Act 1.
It's a good game, but the art style is keeping it far from perfect.
    It's distinctive. I liked Gordian Quest, but it has the most generic art style.
    Yeah the art style is about the ugliest I can think of for an indie game. It's always kept me from truly enjoying the game. Hoping their next game changes it up.
Its really fucking good.

Usually the RogueLite genre turns me off but a deckbuilder was just a perfect fit. 

Its great on mobile except when it eats a whole hour of my day on one run lol.
I doubt it. Surely porting it to an engine other than Unity will make them have to delay it.
    Yeah, but the presentation was probably set before the Unity-news, so either they pulled it or it might still be in, if it was in the first place. If anything, it'll be just a tease
The state of play is about updates to previously announced games.  Best to lower your expectations til they're subterranean.
Yeah was thinking the same. No idea why they were surprised.
    Mostly the fact that I've seen no news whatsoever about them working on anything. A lot of other studios seem to be pretty transparent about what they're working on but I've not really seen anything from Mega Crit Games.
Hilarious...

And necessary
It depends. Without knowing about the game, we can only speculate, but a project like Slay the Spire has a much larger design:implementation ratio than a lot of games.
    Yeah it really varies. I imagine a lot of the time will be upskilling and learning the new tech. Once you're familiar though things *can* (but not necessarily will) go faster if a lot of it is relatively directly translatable.
    Hopefully most of the complex stuff was done in a scripting language that can easily be ported over...
i could see it being delayed by a year at least
    Yup, came to comment this. It could very easily be more than a year of porting and learning before getting to the same speed of development.
This is the most optimistic comment I've seen on Reddit in years.

It most likely is a massive hurdle and it's not done with just migrating to a new engine, after that is it's learning the new engine *and* fixing all the issues that come from how the new engine works differently than Unity.
    Haha, well I was fairly certain it would be a much harder task, but as soon as you say something with certainty on Reddit (rather than phrasing it like a question like I did), someone comes along and says “well actually you can port an entire game from Unity to [Other engine] in literally one click” and then I looked dumb lol
        Hah, fair enough.

And I guess I did the same thing but in reverse, lol.  
My bad, hope I didn't come off full on "akSHuALly" with my reply, not my intention.
In terms of computer science, it will vary a truly insane amount based on their practices. Depends how organized they are and how much they got done in two years, how much is concept vs "built"
It varies mainly by how much their team knows the new engine. The reality of game dev is that a lot of your early code will be rewritten anyway.
Unity won't go ahead with this because it's essentially illegal and will cause them to receive an unprecedented amount of legal action. They will have to backpedal from this stupid idea
Yeah I'm worried that grandpa might be an idiot
And its on gamepass too, so they are really getting fucked over by the install fee.
The old engine is officially gone now with the latest update that adds the local co-op. The not-PC versions have always been Unity.
    Ahh, I see.  They have a good team, I'm sure they'll be fine whatever decision they make.
    Famous composer Tony Fox must be breathing a sigh of relief.

A lot of the fandom has wanted Toby to switch to Unity from GameMaker for a while just for the improved feature set, especially 60 FPS. There was even a project called UniTale to remake Undertale in Unity mostly for that 60 FPS.

He experimented in Unity for Deltarune but ultimately went with GameMaker which he knows back to front. I was disappointed at the time, but in retrospect that was a good decision. Especially considering he now has a small but full dev team to support.

    Is that not considered insider trading?
Seems more like a hostile takeover to me instead, similar situation though. There's just very few other explanations other than ineptitude which I guess is usually the answer but god damn, that level of ineptitude?
[removed]
    You can't migrate from unity in "months".  They'd basically need to restart the entire project.
    Man I remember playing Hollow Knight years ago thinking Silksong was already out and that I should buy it to give it a try. What the heck?
        What do you mean? I thought Silksong was already out?
            Just a few more months
    Migrating away from Unity would be years, not months
    Remember when it was 1 year (or less) away in the Xbox game show thing? Oof.
lol in what world would this make silk song toast? they are still going to sell the game at this point, they have too much money and time sunk in to it to take a moral stance and rebuild in another engine.

they are going to sell 2M copies over its lifetime, and they are going to eat the unity fee because they are still going to make a boat load of money.
    You do realize the new fees could make that debt still
        for mobile games with low returns per user, yes, for a game with a $10+ buy-to-play model that expects hundreds of thousands or millions of sales, no. they'll have a pro or enterprise license, meaning the fee per install will range from 15 cents to 1 cent as they pass each threshold within that monthly period (1 cent at 1M+ downloads with enterprise).

there are many reasons this install fee system is an abysmal idea, but it's not going to put a game like silksong in any financial danger
            My guess is Silksong is also gonna be like $25-30

Edit: and it should be, I'd even pay $40-50 for it tbh
                Hollow Knight is a $60 game for sure. I have more hours in HK than I do in Mario Odyssey
        No they don't. You don't realize the scale of the fee compared to the revenue they'll have 

I did some quick calculation in another comment. Basically it's at max 2$ per sale for those BS fees (and likely smaller, that's counting 10 different devices install before the game pass 1M installs which will take a few hours at most). That's not gonna make a game like Silksong lose money. Plus that's for the free tier of Unity. I doubt a studio like Team Cherry (or Mega Crit) is using this after the success of their first games, they have lower royalties on pro licenses

The problem is far more for the small indies that are already not profitable or barely than for those big games that at worst will lose some of their huge profits. But it's important they speak out because they get more attention than random indie studios nobody knows.
        hollow knight sold ~2m units and Team Cherry has 3 people. silk song will sell at least that over its lifetime. if these fees somehow make them go in to debt they deserve it for their gross negligence.
            Silksong is also day 1 Game Pass, which is going to add a ton of installs, but no sales no counteract the fees. Anything hitting any of GP/PS+ is hit extra hard by the new model.
                Apparently gamepass installs are (somehow) going to be billed to Microsoft. Good luck collecting on that lmao
                    Lmao I am hoping to see them \*try\* to bill Microsoft for that. Microsoft will be more than happy to play that legal game if Unity wants to.
                [deleted]
                    Good luck on them trying to get any money from Microsoft who have no contract/agreement with Unity at all.
            it is per install. with free bundles, game pass, people redownloading the game it can easily take all that money
                Look, I think this new model is shitty and Unity deserves to go down in flames over this, but to be fair, Unity clarified that redownloads won't be counted and that devs won't be paying for Game Pass downloads. If they're selling the game for more than 20 cents a copy they won't be losing money on this. There's certainly enough to be outraged about elsewhere.
                    they also have no plans on how to do this, dispite saying it I don't trust them one bit
                        You're totally right. Unity's "trust us, bro, we know how to count installs fair and square, just don't ask us how" is super shady, and of questionable legality at best.

Meanwhile Unreal is out there saying "oh yeah we go based off your self-reported revenue. We trust you."
After the success of Hollow Knight you assume that Team Cherry is not using the free Unity license

Pro/enterprise Unity licenses pay much less per install only after a much higher ceiling of earnings
    They would still easily be paying over 10k per month with the Pro tier. Likely more seeing as Silksong is highly anticipated, not at all a tiny new IP that miraculously got 2.5m+ in sales.
        And they would be paying extra fees when people redownload hollow Knight to replay it
            No it's just for the first install on a new device. They've changed that. So it's likely only when changing machines (I guess motherboard, that's what identify a PC right?)
                They have failed tell mew machines apart before and have every reason to keep failing
                Or you know, a bad actor running a farm of virtual machines with spoofed hardware IDs and IPs could run a script to continuously install on unique "new" devices to rack up a huge bill for the devs.
                    I mean that's going to a long way just to troll someone and no gain for yourself...
                        Sure is, but when you're popular enough you're inevitably going to attract people who are angry enough and bored enough with the technical knowhow who would jump at the chance to do something like this. Maybe the devs nerf their favorite playstyle, or take the game in an unpopular direction, or maybe they're just mad the game lets you select pronouns or something. I wouldn't underestimate how far some people would go over spite.
        [deleted]
            The math some people have done on the new costs are crazy. Some of the best case scenarios for a *successful* game that costs money and has a moderate player base is around 15%, or triple what Unreal costs *at most*. And there are situations where Unity can cost even more.

Also there's a whole thing of Unity saying distributors will be the ones owing for some cases, like Game Pass, which means there are going to be more headaches because that's questionable legality in the first place.


There are some whose livelihoods depends on what they're working on releasing on time to certain success, but there are tons of devs, universities, etc. already dropping Unity and there's no way I can imagine to win anyone back
                Unity's whole deal is that it's much cheaper than Unreal for a less powerful engine. If it's not even cheaper, why in the world would a dev ever use it again?
                    Unity is also better in ease of use, better for mobile development and is better suited for non-3d games than Unreal is. Those are pretty key areas if you are a small indie dev team trying to push, let's say a 2d rougelike card game or an atmospheric 2d metroidvania game with hand drawn sprites to a variety of platforms. That isn't to say there is no alternative to Unity, but Unreal is probably not the go to answer for many devs, especially those who are speaking out the most currently.
        10k per month is nothing when you do 500k par month (just random numbers), all is relative. Those big indies or companies using Unity won't have much of a risk there I think. It's for the smaller ones (many indies games are not profitable or barely) that it's a problem
Let's calm down the hysteria a bit. Not going to say Unity isn't shitty for how they're trying to roll this out but Silk Song isn't going to be scrapped after being developed for 6+ years because Unity will implement a fee. These guys are probably on the pro version of Unity which lowers the license fee and the game is going to sell millions. Team Cherry will make millions and be fine.
It can't be delayed since it never gave a release date lol
Genshin isn't going to be covered under this change so it does mean something. Also, among games that are difficult to port to a new engine Pokemon Go is not one of them.
    Considering Unity straight up removed the clause that protected you from new TOS by running old versions, that might be their way in to at least attempt to go for Genshin. I am almost certain it won't work because a) MiHoYo is a chinese studio and foreigners don't enjoy many legal protections over there and b) pulling the TOS rug like that is illegal in many countries, including the entirety of the EU. 

This move, if someone with some money chooses to fight, could break Unity not only in reputation, but also legally and financially. I am not a lawyer, but the things I know about consumer protection laws hint at this outcome.
        Genshin isn't covered because they have a different license that excludes them from the changes made by Unity Technologies. So even if it was legal to go after other developers, it wouldn't affect Chinese developers either way.
        >This move, if someone with some money chooses to fight, could break Unity not only in reputation, but also legally and financially

Let's try Disney, Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, Valve, Epic, CDPR, Humble Bundle, EA, Blizzard, The Pokemon company and more. Unity will no longer exist if they try to enforce this on them. Microsoft could just buy Unity outright and shut them down out of spite.
        >  MiHoYo is a chinese studio and foreigners don't enjoy many legal protections over there 

Doesn't matter. Once they set foot in US jurisdiction, they have to obey US law. So they would be sued in US court.

Unless they decide to exit the US market, which I don't think will happen.
        >MiHoYo is a chinese studio and foreigners don't enjoy many legal protections over there and b) pulling the TOS rug like that is illegal in many countries, including the entirety of the EU. 

Then thier income based on Android and Apple store can get fucked. Yea the company can do thing but its money from the West would be held.
    Niantic doesn't have a great history for games they try to port to a new engine. Pokemon Go might be lucky enough to survive that given the IP, but yeah...
    Pokemon go was not the pokemon i was referencing
        Then which? The mainline games and Masters use a proprietary engine, Go is simple and portable if the cost of the engine goes up, and Unite is not affected by this change.
            The remakes of diamond and pearl are on unity
                And it's not even the only Nintendo IP affected. Guess what FE Engage was developed in.
                    oh boy right I remember that
            Pokémon Brilliant Diamond And Shining Pearl
                Those games are already released though right? It just means nintendo couldn't do updates to them anymore, and I wouldn't expect them to anyways.
                    This situation affects games already released. So no not updating them does nothing.
                        That seems... totally insane and unenforceable if that's true. The game was already published under the old license. I don't understand how they could try to change the contract agreement on an already developed and published game. It seems... Impossible? Like if there was active development and updates for a game I could see how they could try to collect those fees, but otherwise I don't see how that's possible.
                            Well yeah it is insane and thats why everyone is up in arms
                        It's true that the new pricing structure applies to previously released games. However I think it's highly likely that for something as big as the Pokemon games, they made an individual license agreement with Unity ahead of time. Big companies like that don't just create an account on Unity's website and subscribe to a few Pro version seats. They workout their own licensing deals for the engine. This new pricing scheme won't apply to their games.
I would also bet the big games like that and hearthstone are getting their own custom deals.

No way would they risk their big dogs.
    Will have to see because it wasnt a risk before right.
        Acti-blizz legal doesn't fuck around like that. They'll have a custom license.
        The sourcing and contract people at my much smaller company wouldn't allow a contract that doesn't have pricing set in very solid stone. Pretty much every contract we have is custom. 

There is no way a large company like blizzard or Nintendo wouldn't have a custom contract.
            They'll be sued into the stone age by Microsoft since they plan to charge them, a company they do not have a contract with, fees per game install. They are outright delusional.
There is zero chance either of those games is using the shrink-wrap license, even at the highest tier. They almost certainly have a negotiated agreement that won't be subject to this fuckery.
You can right whatever you write in a TOS it doesn't mean it's legal or enforceable.
Just because you put something into a contract doesn't mean it's legal to put in a contract. As a hypothetical, if the contract said Unity had the right to kill your first-born child, they wouldn't actually have that right.

I'm not a lawyer so I do not want to speak on whether or not what they've actually done is legal.
    Always with the extremes LOL.

>For any Offering consisting of Software or an Online Service that Unity makes available to you, Unity hereby grants you a non-exclusive, limited, revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable right to access and use the Offering

>You acknowledge that Unity may from time to time modify, discontinue, substitute or terminate an Offering (including any Entitlements), including during a paid subscription term, or add or modify license keys, authorizations or other means of controlling access to or use of the Offerings, when needed to comply with applicable law or regulation, or for justified commercial, security or operational reasons, including to make any improvements to access and use of the Offerings. Unity may change the price of an Offering, including the renewal price of a subscription as of the next renewal date, and we will provide you with prior notice if we do so.

Pretty cut and dry my dudes. People messaging me here like they've never read a contract in their life. It's the same with the Unreal Engine. It's their property, they can do what they want with it.
        Yes, I used an extreme hypothetical to illustrate the point. That was the entire point of my comment. I'm not here to refute what is or isn't in the contract. I'm saying that just because it's there does not mean it's legally enforceable. A contract isn't some magic spell that lets you do anything you want to. You're responding to the question of "is this legal to do" with the idea that it's in the contract, and that's simply not a legitimate answer.
        I don't think you understood what people were telling you. There are authorities above Unity that will enforce their own rules, no matter what the contract says. For example, if you make an online store in Europe and on your ToS you say "by buying in this store you waive your right to refund within 14 days", it doesn't matter. You still have to refund people if they ask you to or they can take you to court in Europe and you will lose. 

So what the other posters were saying is that *if* retroactively applying a ToS is illegal in certain places, then it doesn't matter that they added that clause in it.
Pretty sure that is not legal.
[deleted]
    So you’re saying the law should change and business to business contracts should require more notice? Or that this is the law now?
Thanks so much for writing this all out!
With the direction Unity as a company is going, changing to a new technical stack is inevitable. The issues with Unity goes beyond them trying to nick and dime their customers, the entire company is becoming dumpster fire.

The warning signs have been there for years that Unity is not a horse you want to bet anymore on, yet these devs chose to ignore them. And even now they are refusing to stop betting on it.
    Agreed, but I'm not surprised that studios that are already knee deep in a project built in Unity are trying to push back for the short term. Mega Crit might have already 100% decided that they're not going to use Unity for any new projects, but they could have tens of thousands of work hours put into a current project, and trying to port it to a new engine now would very likely add thousands of more hours to it.

It's not the kind of switch that every studio is in a situation to make on a dime.
For sure, but now they'll forever be wondering if they're risking their business by not doing so
    I don't think there will be any wondering at all. They are 100% not going to use unity for any other future projects, even if this runtime fee thing is completely rolled back.
That's what happens after an IPO apparently lmao
    [removed]
Supporting the same language is very useful for keeping existing internal logic, but any time you're talking to the engine's API's you mostly gotta rewrite that shit to fit the new engine.
    Oh yeah that could be a major issue, especially if not all API calls are 1:1 between engine.
I've always wanted to play games on Android Auto, personally
    "Hey siri. Buy more grandmas in cookie clicker."
StS is the new Doom. Soon enough we'll see people doing A20 streaks on oscilloscopes and tamagotchis
I know you're joking, but Slay the Spire is not made in Unity.
    Ah, you're correct. I forgot that part immediately after reading it. Thanks!
I know that's why it's funny? They make it look like a PR statement and then end up with a fuck lol
    Ah, I thought you were trying to say the opposite.
Genshin Impact, Marvel Snap, and Pokemon Go all run on Unity too, and I dunno who in their right mind would want to take on Hoyoverse, Disney, and Nintendo all at the same time.
    Yeah, they're fucked. This is going to be hilarious.
        I'm pretty sure Microsoft is on the list too. I think they claimed that fee's will be charged to the distributors, so unity games on GamePass. Or Microsoft just pulls Unity based games from their catalog, but time will tell.
            
>I think they claimed that fee's will be charged to the distributors

Which is fucking hysterical, because that means they're also going to try to charge Valve, Epic, EA, CDPR, Sony, Nintendo and a variety other storefronts as well. None of whom have contracts with them. They apparently *want* to be sued by everyone under the sun.

I don't think they even consulted a lawyer, this is so blatantly illegal I'm shocked that they thought this was a good idea.
                Well consider the CEO was trh same EA guy who had bright ideas such as making the player pay money to repair their in-game car and generally made EA look like the greediest, worst gaming company and it starts making sense.

Why a clown like that is still in such a high ranked highly paid position is still baffling
                    >Why a clown like that is still in such a high ranked highly paid position is still baffling

He apparently sold off stock like a week or two ago before dropping this. He might end up being investigated by financial regulators at the end of this lol.
                        Bet he's shorting the stock too, or having someone else do it on his behalf.
                    > Why a clown like that is still in such a high ranked highly paid position is still baffling

Rich people have benefits us lowly workers don't have, including the advantage of failing your way upwards.
                Yeah, when devs started asking Unity folks how things like gamepass would work with this, the response they got from management was basically "Well we're going to have to sit down and have some discussions with the subscription services about it."

I didn't go to business school, so maybe I'm way off base here, but maybe you should've had those conversations and figured all of this out with the relevant parties before you announce a major change that you say is going to go into effect 4 months from now. 

Microsoft/Valve/Epic/Sony/Apple/Nintendo/etc. are all going to tell Unity to go pound sand if asked to cough up a payment per install. They don't want to have to track that stuff for a third party company, and at this point, there's no way any of them are going to want to wade into this mess on Unity's side.
                    Great point. Did they really think the platform holders would be all chill with this?
            Microsoft owns Obsidian now I think, who made Pillars of Eternity 1 & 2 with Unity.
                The Ori games are Unity as well, perhaps even the new game that Moon Studios is working on?

I think Hearthstone is Unity as well? So ActiBlizz also in the boat
    Don't forget Microsoft, EA, and Sony. Plus you can probably include Valve, Apple, and Google, as they're the ones distributing the games and thus the ones that somehow need to track unique installs.
    You think they don't know this? This is exactly the companies they are going for, the indies are just a nice extra. Unity also has a lot of money, and at some point more money doesn't help you in legal battles. Courts have to decide this, although I have high hopes that this won't fly in europe at all.
    All of them with get special exclusive deals that eliminate the fees
All of Hoyoverse's popular games use Unity, as well. And they have enough fuck you money to get into a massive legal battle over this if they wanted.
    And that money will presumably get backup from the plumber's ninjas and the Mouse's legal team. All Unity has done here is given everyone else a target, ironically causing unity in the process.
Wild Rift you mean? I think League on PC runs a variation of some big rigs engine or some shit.
> I don't think they will back-pedal either,

They already did a little bit. Mostly about re-installs. But most people didn't hear about it because they didn't update their official pages on this and as Mega Crit mentioned, the trust has already been broken.
Unreal has always been a strong contender, and I've heard good things about Godot as well. Honestly Godot might be the biggest winner coming out of all this.
    People also sleep on Game Maker. Games like Hotline Miami, Hyper Light Drifter, and Undertale were made with it. It's a *very* capable engine if smaller scale, 2D stuff is what a dev team is going for.
    Godot doesn't have real console support without doing it yourself completely which is why it's not viable for a lot of smaller devs. Unreal is more high end option that is not always suitable for smaller teams.
It's not 20%. That would be steep, but within the realms of reason. Or at least the realms of, well, reality.

It's $0.20 per install. Not per sale, per *install*. There are so many problems with tacking it to installs rather than sales that it's difficult to fully get it across. Just for starters though, imagine someone bought your game, and then paid for a botnet to install said game on 10,000 devices. Now imagine they bought your cheap game 100 times and installed on each device 100 times.

Someone spent maybe a grand at most on a botnet and 100 copies of your game, and now you owe $200,000 to Unity. As a small indie dev, you're probably bankrupt and whatever internet troll you pissed off is laughing his ass off.

And this is assuming that Unity somehow manages to put together a decent enough install detection system that means you need to actually buy the game and have a botnet to do this. More realistically, their methods for detecting installs will by shoddy, and one guy who bought your game and doesn't care for it much might be able to spoof thousands of installs a day on their computer with a simple VPN and a script.
    >It's $0.20 per install. Not per sale, per install.  

I know, I just went with worst assumption in mind (basically sale for 1 game for 1$). Unity said, that they wouldnt make pay for re-install (for same game) AND that they would check for bad actors (how the hell, they will do that, that is a very fucking good question).  

>And this is assuming that Unity somehow manages to put together a decent enough install detection system that means you need to actually buy the game and have a botnet to do this.  

Yes, would love to see how they will implement this.  
I can see this being fine, if using Steam (or any of big launchers), but will see. Either way this is a big L for Unity and its community.
        > Unity said, that they wouldnt make pay for re-install

You'd still need to pay per device though. If someone buys your $1 game and installs it on their PC, their laptop, their phone, their work PC, and their friend's PC, suddenly you owe Unity 100% of that sale. Then they get a new PC and a new phone a year later and suddenly you're losing money on each game.
            >If someone buys your $1 game and installs it on their PC, their laptop, their phone, their work PC, and their friend's PC, suddenly you owe Unity 100% of that sale.  

Yeap, that is the super bad scenario :( Thats why waiting for more info. But it still would require those 200k profit and 200k installs. So at worst, can stop selling game when you get close to 200k sales (if sale is 1$).  
This will hit mobile, f2p markets the most.
> Currently learning about Unity myself, wouldnt mind paying 20% from 200k IF i would hit it big

  Ok bro, except you probably wont. Stop simping for unity...
    Mate, I literally said that I most likely wouldnt.  
I am just saying that if you are solo dev then these changes dont matter for more than 90% of users. Rarely you will see solo dev with 200k in revenue and 200k installs in a year.
Even if this particular change wouldn't affect you, what would stop Unity from changing the terms again? They have shown that they are willing to fuck their users over.
Worth also adding on top of this, they made their own ogl equivalent in response, [ORC](https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sico?). They made sure to make it completely irrevocable.
isaac, spelunky, and spire are the holy trinity for me.
    FTL too
        FTL will always be number one in my heart
            For as much as I love FTL I sure am terrible at it.
                I think it's one of the hardest roguelikes without being unfun, theres a lot going on in it, both mechanically and in decision making.
                I thought being terrible at it was the point. Are you telling me people are good at it? Unthinkable.

Oh, my crew got spaced again.
                Use pause a lot more, for example pause before missle impact and turn on cloak
            I remember the first time I played FTL. I downloaded it at like 7 PM and figured I would play for a couple of hours and call it a night. When I lifted my head from the game it was 4 AM.
        I unfortunately find the end game of FTL painfully unsatisfying and restrictive. The perfect game is a heavily modded FTL where the player's power level outscales the original game by degrees, and has challenges to match.

Of course the best of those also tell you the final challenges ahead of time, and Oh Hey, that's a Slay the Spire thing. Game so good it fixes other good games.
        What about Streets of Rouge?
    No dead cells?! Your subjective opinion is wrong!
        Sorry /u/DeadCellsTop5 the best I can do is 6th place
            Wrong! Lol. I actually have dead cells as my #4 game on my top 25 all-time list. I fucking love that game. I've got Slay the Spire at #9 on the same list, so I fucking love that game too.
                Would you share your top 25 list? I’m curious. Thanks

My rule is only one game per series is allowed, otherwise it's too repetitive with multiple from the same franchise. It's also always changing. This is where I'm at now, though. Not a big RPG guy, nor a Nintendo guy.
                        Your lack of Metal Gear Solid representation is disturbing
        Personally I'd like it more if it forced the player to react to builds more, react to rng. Even with all items unlocked it's not too hard to end up at similar setups in back to back runs, especially with how powerful shops are, let alone with Wish. And the boring stat system ensures you've already committed to a stat before the end of the first level. It is great fun to get in the zone and not drop balanced blade stacks throughout an entire biome, and bosses can be fun in the Goldilocks zone between the struggle bus and instantly vaporizing them with things like baseball bat or half of tactics.

My favorite roguelite currently is Against the Storm by contrast, where playing at a high level is defined by how well you react to the hand you're dealt. StS is also like this at a high level, though some archetypes become near impossible to build past a15.

Edit: To summarize, Dead Cells is a fine action 2d platformer, and not a great roguelite for me.
            I second Against the Storm, it's a mix of a roguelike with the old city builders (Caesar/Pharaoh) where you can actually lose which makes it more appealing than say Two Point Campus where you eventually just win.  Add in the fact that no game feels the same and it's easily one of my picks of this decade.
                I've tried the Against the Storm demo a couple of times and can't get into it? Which is sad because rougelites and city builders are my two favourite genres. Did it take a while for it to 'click' for you?
                    It took me a few games to get it to click (like ignore house locations etc) but once the difficulty starts ramping up it has a great gameplay loop.  I'd say it's more old school builder (theme hospital,caesar 3) rather than cities skylines as you're building around the disasters/resources rather than making a nice looking city.  I personally have 221 hours in it so far.
            can you define roguelite for me? feels like we've lost the plot when a city builder is a roguelite.
                How about:

A game where you perform a series of "runs" where each run has a significant amount of randomness. Each run is challenging and failure/death may frequently end the run unsuccessfully. Often, roguelites have some kind of meta-progression between runs. Roguelites are intended to be played many times, rather than once and done, since a lot of content or progression is only unlocked after multiple runs.

Against the Storm is clearly a roguelite imo.
                    I would also add that each run isn't particularly long. I think for me, most "runs" when learning cap out at 35 minutes or so. Once I am good at them, under 25 or under 20.
                    is tropico a roguelite? randomness, runs, meta progression, gated content.
                        I don't think tropico has the same level of randomness (you can build any/all the same buildings every time, maps and events are handmade for campaign mode) nor is failure/death a significant threat. There also is no progression if you fail. It's just a regular campaign game. Frequent failure is a core part of the experience of roguelites.
                I would define a roguelite as: short run/round/map-focused gameplay, start from scratch each run, high variance in equipment/cards/enemies/objectives/strategy each run, after each run you have meta progression for the next run. Against the storm and slay the spire ticks all these boxes.
                Against the Storm is undoubtedly a roguelite haha, I don't care to quibble about this. It's a roguelite first, the towns you build are extremely temporary in nature, the city-building nature plays second fiddle to the fact that all your buildings and decisions are meant to win the map, not raise a mighty city or empire.
        Can't forget Hades
        Always feel like I'm taking crazy pills because I did not like Dead Cells at all. I play tons of roguelites and Dead Cells would be towards the bottom of the rankings. I found nothing about the game engaging.
            Boy, you crazy! Nah, it's all personal opinion, so it doesn't matter. I find the combat so incredibly satisfying. It's quick, it's snappy, it's predictable. I LOVE the dodge roll and how your can dodge cancel out of nearly any animation. I honestly think it's the best 2D action game out there because the combat is damn near perfect. Then the biomes are all distinct with their own enemy types and the ng+ modes add so much to an already stellar game. Then throw in all of the build possibilities with all the weapons and the multiple branching pathways and it's like roguelite heaven for me.
                See that's the weird thing, my biggest complaint is that I didn't like the combat. Maybe if I unlocked more stuff I would have enjoyed it more - that is kind of a common gripe with roguelites. But yeah the combat from the handful of hours I played just bored me.
                    Man, that's crazy to me. That combat is incredible. Pretty much every review praises it. I've never seen anyone complain about the combat before. You should give it another shot, or at least watch some gameplay from a streamer or someone deeper in the game. The weapon variety is insane too.
                        The weapon variety at least at the start of the game seemed really limited. And maybe I just don't actually like 2d action combat lol.
        No Dead Cells and no Hades. 

Hades, Dead Cells and Slay the Spire is the trinity of roguelikes IMO. FTL if it's a quatuor
    Enter the Gungeon is clearly the best and it's not even close. This discussion make me realise how many amazing roguelites there are, wow!
        I was going to say the same! Enter the Gungeon on a hypothetical "best roguelite games" list would be the top if not real close to it. The game is just so damn charming on top of some highly addicting gameplay.
            I love the game but it’s too f’ing hard for me. Took me 70 hrs to beat the Dragun and that was with a Sir Junkan lucky but cheesy strat. It was just too hard to get enough time on the lower levels. I didn’t put serious time after the large expansion/patch they did but heard it got balanced a bit smoother.

Edit: also played it on Switch which may have had something to do with it. I was shocked at how much better a Hades player I was on a 144 hz monitor at high res.
    And Monster Train, I think the only card roguelite I really liked. There is Erannorth Chronicles but that one is more sandbox than roguelite.
    Noita is #1 for me but inno what 2 and 3 are
    Risk of Rain 2
Something that I think STS got right is how difficult it is to play defensively. I like Pirates Outlaws and Dawncaster more than STS, but both of those games made defending easier. The problem is that defensive strats are significantly easier than offensive ones; if you take one big hit, you have to expend resources to recover that could be spent elsewhere. If your deck is defensive and kills opponent gradually without taking damage, you can spend your resources on something else, adding up significantly over the course of a run.
Have you beaten the heart with all 4 though? That shit can make a man lose his damn mind lol
    Baalorlord (one of the top StS players) said something along the lines of A10 Heart being harder than A20 without Heart. I'm not sure how much I agree with it but it's definitely a massive step up to fight the Heart on any ascension. It's a very befitting boss as the ultimate test of your deck.
        Heart is just ridiculous. You can have a deck that absolutely crushes everything, including the boss before the heart, only to get wiped by the heart in 3 turns. It can be very deflating. Still haven't beaten it with the watcher
            Watcher is a tricky character to play but once you get the hang of her you'll realize she's way stronger than the initial three. She came later and didn't get quite as much balancing, to the point people say she's like a fan made character. The most consistent way to play her is to stance dance, to the point if all you're doing is taking absolutely no cards in Act 1 except Talk to the Hand, Mental Fortress, Tantrum (if you haven't upgraded Eruption yet), 1 Inner Peace or Fear No Evil, and Rushdown and you'll build an infinite which can brute force a win in a small number of attempts.
                I once watched Jorbs go unreasonably far in a Watcher A20 run taking zero cards to make a point. The biggest mistake people make with Watcher is not realizing how strong her starting deck is and adding a bunch of junk to it.
                Watcher being the strongest character is exactly what leads to Watcher runs primarily fizzling at the Heart battle.

Even infinites can fail against heart if you don't find passive block generation as you are forced to tank a LOT of damage across the first three turns no matter what.
                I don't think it's that they didn't balance it as much, it's that her main mechanic of Wrath is one of these things where it's either broken or it feels very bad and not that fun, and they'd rather have Watcher be fun for the average player even if she ends up broken for A20 players.
            lifecoach1981 is currently doing 50 watcher wins in a row on twitch, sitting on 21 right now. maybe you can learn some tricks there (asc 20 ofc) - but be warned, some runs take 8 hours..
                Ages ago when he was a Hearthstone pro he was called "ropecoach" because he always used the maximum turn time to think (the ending countdown is visualized by a rope that burns across the screen)

Looks like some things never change...
                    People still meme about him in Hearthstone even though he hasn't been playing the game for like 5 years.
                Is he beating the heart every time? I've beaten the game with the watcher, just not the heart
                    Yes, a win = ASC20 including heart. Is at 22 in a row now, just finished his latest run an hour ago :)
            Heart isn't the biggest problem. The problem is the last path towards it. Starts with a resting site which is useless there in terms of healing because you'll heal all the way after the boss anyway. So you can either upgrade one card or if you're lucky and have the relics either get another relic or get more HP. All of these are mostly useless there. Then a merchant, then that Miniboss with the two attacking sides. Those two are already massively dangerous and I mostly go out of that fight with half health. And with that sliver to survive the heart is almost impossible. Would be a whole lot easier if the resting site came after the miniboss.
            I beat the very first heart fight i ever did with the silent, had that relic that revives with 50% HP and forgot about it, also had Fairy in a bottle lol, literally died twice to win, crazy fight.

I beat the boss before the heart in like 4 turns.

It was a Bullet Time, Runic Pyramid run where i would draw 10 cards every turn and Snecko Skull applying like 50 poison per turn, very fun
            Pro tip: To help beat the Heart with Watcher, "see a Talk to the Hand, take a Talk to the Hand"
        Eyy, another Baalorlord enjoyer! I kind of agree with him, tbh. I've got to A20 on every character, but I'm only up to A5 with heart kills (so I can't speak to his exact statement about A10 heart, unfortunately). Act 4 requires different tactics than the rest of the game, to some extent, so building a deck to do it all is an extra challenge.
            What I'm not sure I agree with is how much higher is the jump in difficulty. I'm not sure it's as high as 10 ascensions. That said, he has like 6k more hours than me and the last time I touched A10H was when I was climbing ascensions, so I don't have a good reference to what not fighting the Heart feels like since I always prepared for it.
                Ahh, gotcha! Yeah, I did a climb to 20 first to adjust to the new mechanics at each level before I went into dedicated heart kills. I got a couple here and there on runs I felt were going well, but now I'm counting it as my win condition to ascend.
                I've beaten A20H on all 4 characters multiple times and I dropped down to A10 for fun. I am way more successful at A10H than I am at even getting out of act 2 on A20 lol. Maybe I just suck, but I'd guess for me it'd be like A20 is easier than A17H
    Nah, not on A20
>Even if they have more depth to them

What on earth are you smoking that you think there are multiple other games that have more depth than slay the spire? The level of depth, especially going for the heart on a20 is as deep of a strategy game as there is out there.
Slay the Spire then becomes stupidly better with Downfall. It's like every single one of the best modders came together to make Slay the Spire 2.

I consider Marisa a base game character too. One of the best designed standalone ones. They actually have some custom logic just for ger cards in Downfall.
    I'll check it out. Never played any mods or anything.
I've also hit A20 and after struggling for a million years to try and beat it, I just started playing custom games for fun.

Shit reinvirgorated the game for me and I have hundreds of hours. Screwing around in the game is as fun as trying hard IMO.
Is the iOS port any good? The Android one is terrible. Still the same game, but poorly executed. Cards are sticky, so you wind up playing cards you were trying to read if you're not really careful. Not using Save and Quit can result in your run getting deleted entirely when your phone moves STS out of RAM. Etcetera.
    It's pretty good. I run into the sticky card problem sometimes and it's worse on iPhone because sometimes you pull up the notification center screen and it minimizes the game. It's a UX issue.

Other than that, performance wise, it's great. STS never crashed, I've never ran into the save issue, STS never locked my phone. FWIW I have an iPhone 14 Pro, but I think it runs great on older phones, as long as it isn't an iPhone SE or an X.
What about the heart, though?
    A20 Heart is way too hard. I don’t have the skill to do that. I’ll leave to the pros and streamers. :(
I found the game Vault of the Void to have a much better take on this, where every single starting deck had no generic "Attack" and "Block" cards, they all had some other effect or nuance, which in some cases were pretty major.
    Sounds interesting, I'll give it a look!
I tried to get the last rogue unlock several times and each time after completing a run and seeing that I still needed lots of runs I just "nope" and deleted the game...

RNG is pretty wild, and you have close to no way with controlling it. I like roguelites which have some unlocking over time mechanics of rerolling offers or bumping chances of specific buff/card classes. It feels good when you finished the game few times, get some upgrade to force some build and try out different builds, instead here you're forced to play whatever you're getting on each run.
    If you haven't tried Vault of the Void yet, definitely give it a look. I got into it precisely because you can straight-up start some of the fun gimmicky builds instead of having to build up to them from a boring attack/block deck.
    Oh boy… Maybe you should give it more time. At a high level, almost every class can go infinite with their deck rather consistently whether it be infinite damage,block,energy etc. So saying that you’re forced to play with whatever you’re getting when in actual fact the high level play revolves around 1 kind of deck reveals how little you’ve played.
        No, it's not about "forced to play", rather, I usually wanna play some specific build and have some tools to force rng to be more likely to give me needed cards/artifacts/etc. Like, I know that rogue can go into shiv build(and almost auto lose if floor 3 boss is that fucker with 12 cards reset mechanics), the usual draw/discard build(I think last time I beat with that) and with poison. I just want to play poison with that double poison card, but sadly it's locked by lots of runs, which I'd have to play without it, which isn't something I'd want to do.
I like what some other games in the genre have done with starting cards. In STS, your starting cards are bad and you're better off removing them.

Pirates Outlaws gives every class at least one card in their starting deck that's actively great for the class's direction. Classes that are unlocked later are given some pretty wild starter decks that push them in directions that the simpler classes could never go in (for example, the Cursed Captain gets a card that discards all his curses and redraws and the Fortune Teller starts with a Curse that makes all her other cards more powerful while it's in hand).

Dawncaster made it really interesting. Each class has one or two colors, a set of basic attacks, a set of weapon abilities (passives and/or an ability that can be activated for an effect between battles), and a list of cards that you start the game with one of in your deck. You pick one of each (you get 8 copies of the basic attack). Most of them synergize in one way or another (ex. The Rogue has a basic attack that inflicts poison if chained, a weapon power that heals them whenever an enemy takes poison damage, and a starting card that increases how much damage poison inflicts per trigger). Some of them interact in crazy ways; the Hunter has a basic attack where each copy records how much damage its dealt that battle and adds it to its current damage that dovetails deliciously with a starting card that returns cards from your discard pile.

These games make it feel like you have some kind of build from the very first fight, where in STS you're often only partway there by the end of Act 1.
It's distinctive. I liked Gordian Quest, but it has the most generic art style.
Yeah the art style is about the ugliest I can think of for an indie game. It's always kept me from truly enjoying the game. Hoping their next game changes it up.
Yeah, but the presentation was probably set before the Unity-news, so either they pulled it or it might still be in, if it was in the first place. If anything, it'll be just a tease
Mostly the fact that I've seen no news whatsoever about them working on anything. A lot of other studios seem to be pretty transparent about what they're working on but I've not really seen anything from Mega Crit Games.
Yeah it really varies. I imagine a lot of the time will be upskilling and learning the new tech. Once you're familiar though things *can* (but not necessarily will) go faster if a lot of it is relatively directly translatable.
Hopefully most of the complex stuff was done in a scripting language that can easily be ported over...
Yup, came to comment this. It could very easily be more than a year of porting and learning before getting to the same speed of development.
Haha, well I was fairly certain it would be a much harder task, but as soon as you say something with certainty on Reddit (rather than phrasing it like a question like I did), someone comes along and says “well actually you can port an entire game from Unity to [Other engine] in literally one click” and then I looked dumb lol
    Hah, fair enough.

And I guess I did the same thing but in reverse, lol.  
My bad, hope I didn't come off full on "akSHuALly" with my reply, not my intention.
Ahh, I see.  They have a good team, I'm sure they'll be fine whatever decision they make.
Famous composer Tony Fox must be breathing a sigh of relief.

A lot of the fandom has wanted Toby to switch to Unity from GameMaker for a while just for the improved feature set, especially 60 FPS. There was even a project called UniTale to remake Undertale in Unity mostly for that 60 FPS.

He experimented in Unity for Deltarune but ultimately went with GameMaker which he knows back to front. I was disappointed at the time, but in retrospect that was a good decision. Especially considering he now has a small but full dev team to support.
Is that not considered insider trading?
You can't migrate from unity in "months".  They'd basically need to restart the entire project.
Man I remember playing Hollow Knight years ago thinking Silksong was already out and that I should buy it to give it a try. What the heck?
    What do you mean? I thought Silksong was already out?
        Just a few more months
Migrating away from Unity would be years, not months
Remember when it was 1 year (or less) away in the Xbox game show thing? Oof.
You do realize the new fees could make that debt still
    for mobile games with low returns per user, yes, for a game with a $10+ buy-to-play model that expects hundreds of thousands or millions of sales, no. they'll have a pro or enterprise license, meaning the fee per install will range from 15 cents to 1 cent as they pass each threshold within that monthly period (1 cent at 1M+ downloads with enterprise).

there are many reasons this install fee system is an abysmal idea, but it's not going to put a game like silksong in any financial danger
        My guess is Silksong is also gonna be like $25-30

Edit: and it should be, I'd even pay $40-50 for it tbh
            Hollow Knight is a $60 game for sure. I have more hours in HK than I do in Mario Odyssey
    No they don't. You don't realize the scale of the fee compared to the revenue they'll have 

I did some quick calculation in another comment. Basically it's at max 2$ per sale for those BS fees (and likely smaller, that's counting 10 different devices install before the game pass 1M installs which will take a few hours at most). That's not gonna make a game like Silksong lose money. Plus that's for the free tier of Unity. I doubt a studio like Team Cherry (or Mega Crit) is using this after the success of their first games, they have lower royalties on pro licenses

The problem is far more for the small indies that are already not profitable or barely than for those big games that at worst will lose some of their huge profits. But it's important they speak out because they get more attention than random indie studios nobody knows.
    hollow knight sold ~2m units and Team Cherry has 3 people. silk song will sell at least that over its lifetime. if these fees somehow make them go in to debt they deserve it for their gross negligence.
        Silksong is also day 1 Game Pass, which is going to add a ton of installs, but no sales no counteract the fees. Anything hitting any of GP/PS+ is hit extra hard by the new model.
            Apparently gamepass installs are (somehow) going to be billed to Microsoft. Good luck collecting on that lmao
                Lmao I am hoping to see them \*try\* to bill Microsoft for that. Microsoft will be more than happy to play that legal game if Unity wants to.
            [deleted]
                Good luck on them trying to get any money from Microsoft who have no contract/agreement with Unity at all.
        it is per install. with free bundles, game pass, people redownloading the game it can easily take all that money
            Look, I think this new model is shitty and Unity deserves to go down in flames over this, but to be fair, Unity clarified that redownloads won't be counted and that devs won't be paying for Game Pass downloads. If they're selling the game for more than 20 cents a copy they won't be losing money on this. There's certainly enough to be outraged about elsewhere.
                they also have no plans on how to do this, dispite saying it I don't trust them one bit
                    You're totally right. Unity's "trust us, bro, we know how to count installs fair and square, just don't ask us how" is super shady, and of questionable legality at best.

Meanwhile Unreal is out there saying "oh yeah we go based off your self-reported revenue. We trust you."
They would still easily be paying over 10k per month with the Pro tier. Likely more seeing as Silksong is highly anticipated, not at all a tiny new IP that miraculously got 2.5m+ in sales.
    And they would be paying extra fees when people redownload hollow Knight to replay it
        No it's just for the first install on a new device. They've changed that. So it's likely only when changing machines (I guess motherboard, that's what identify a PC right?)
            They have failed tell mew machines apart before and have every reason to keep failing
            Or you know, a bad actor running a farm of virtual machines with spoofed hardware IDs and IPs could run a script to continuously install on unique "new" devices to rack up a huge bill for the devs.
                I mean that's going to a long way just to troll someone and no gain for yourself...
                    Sure is, but when you're popular enough you're inevitably going to attract people who are angry enough and bored enough with the technical knowhow who would jump at the chance to do something like this. Maybe the devs nerf their favorite playstyle, or take the game in an unpopular direction, or maybe they're just mad the game lets you select pronouns or something. I wouldn't underestimate how far some people would go over spite.

        The math some people have done on the new costs are crazy. Some of the best case scenarios for a *successful* game that costs money and has a moderate player base is around 15%, or triple what Unreal costs *at most*. And there are situations where Unity can cost even more.

Also there's a whole thing of Unity saying distributors will be the ones owing for some cases, like Game Pass, which means there are going to be more headaches because that's questionable legality in the first place.


There are some whose livelihoods depends on what they're working on releasing on time to certain success, but there are tons of devs, universities, etc. already dropping Unity and there's no way I can imagine to win anyone back
            Unity's whole deal is that it's much cheaper than Unreal for a less powerful engine. If it's not even cheaper, why in the world would a dev ever use it again?
                Unity is also better in ease of use, better for mobile development and is better suited for non-3d games than Unreal is. Those are pretty key areas if you are a small indie dev team trying to push, let's say a 2d rougelike card game or an atmospheric 2d metroidvania game with hand drawn sprites to a variety of platforms. That isn't to say there is no alternative to Unity, but Unreal is probably not the go to answer for many devs, especially those who are speaking out the most currently.
    10k per month is nothing when you do 500k par month (just random numbers), all is relative. Those big indies or companies using Unity won't have much of a risk there I think. It's for the smaller ones (many indies games are not profitable or barely) that it's a problem
Considering Unity straight up removed the clause that protected you from new TOS by running old versions, that might be their way in to at least attempt to go for Genshin. I am almost certain it won't work because a) MiHoYo is a chinese studio and foreigners don't enjoy many legal protections over there and b) pulling the TOS rug like that is illegal in many countries, including the entirety of the EU. 

This move, if someone with some money chooses to fight, could break Unity not only in reputation, but also legally and financially. I am not a lawyer, but the things I know about consumer protection laws hint at this outcome.
    Genshin isn't covered because they have a different license that excludes them from the changes made by Unity Technologies. So even if it was legal to go after other developers, it wouldn't affect Chinese developers either way.
    >This move, if someone with some money chooses to fight, could break Unity not only in reputation, but also legally and financially

Let's try Disney, Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, Valve, Epic, CDPR, Humble Bundle, EA, Blizzard, The Pokemon company and more. Unity will no longer exist if they try to enforce this on them. Microsoft could just buy Unity outright and shut them down out of spite.
    >  MiHoYo is a chinese studio and foreigners don't enjoy many legal protections over there 

Doesn't matter. Once they set foot in US jurisdiction, they have to obey US law. So they would be sued in US court.

Unless they decide to exit the US market, which I don't think will happen.
    >MiHoYo is a chinese studio and foreigners don't enjoy many legal protections over there and b) pulling the TOS rug like that is illegal in many countries, including the entirety of the EU. 

Then thier income based on Android and Apple store can get fucked. Yea the company can do thing but its money from the West would be held.
Niantic doesn't have a great history for games they try to port to a new engine. Pokemon Go might be lucky enough to survive that given the IP, but yeah...
Pokemon go was not the pokemon i was referencing
    Then which? The mainline games and Masters use a proprietary engine, Go is simple and portable if the cost of the engine goes up, and Unite is not affected by this change.
        The remakes of diamond and pearl are on unity
            And it's not even the only Nintendo IP affected. Guess what FE Engage was developed in.
                oh boy right I remember that
        Pokémon Brilliant Diamond And Shining Pearl
            Those games are already released though right? It just means nintendo couldn't do updates to them anymore, and I wouldn't expect them to anyways.
                This situation affects games already released. So no not updating them does nothing.
                    That seems... totally insane and unenforceable if that's true. The game was already published under the old license. I don't understand how they could try to change the contract agreement on an already developed and published game. It seems... Impossible? Like if there was active development and updates for a game I could see how they could try to collect those fees, but otherwise I don't see how that's possible.
                        Well yeah it is insane and thats why everyone is up in arms
                    It's true that the new pricing structure applies to previously released games. However I think it's highly likely that for something as big as the Pokemon games, they made an individual license agreement with Unity ahead of time. Big companies like that don't just create an account on Unity's website and subscribe to a few Pro version seats. They workout their own licensing deals for the engine. This new pricing scheme won't apply to their games.
Will have to see because it wasnt a risk before right.
    Acti-blizz legal doesn't fuck around like that. They'll have a custom license.
    The sourcing and contract people at my much smaller company wouldn't allow a contract that doesn't have pricing set in very solid stone. Pretty much every contract we have is custom. 

There is no way a large company like blizzard or Nintendo wouldn't have a custom contract.
        They'll be sued into the stone age by Microsoft since they plan to charge them, a company they do not have a contract with, fees per game install. They are outright delusional.
Always with the extremes LOL.

Pretty cut and dry my dudes. People messaging me here like they've never read a contract in their life. It's the same with the Unreal Engine. It's their property, they can do what they want with it.
    Yes, I used an extreme hypothetical to illustrate the point. That was the entire point of my comment. I'm not here to refute what is or isn't in the contract. I'm saying that just because it's there does not mean it's legally enforceable. A contract isn't some magic spell that lets you do anything you want to. You're responding to the question of "is this legal to do" with the idea that it's in the contract, and that's simply not a legitimate answer.
    I don't think you understood what people were telling you. There are authorities above Unity that will enforce their own rules, no matter what the contract says. For example, if you make an online store in Europe and on your ToS you say "by buying in this store you waive your right to refund within 14 days", it doesn't matter. You still have to refund people if they ask you to or they can take you to court in Europe and you will lose. 

So what the other posters were saying is that *if* retroactively applying a ToS is illegal in certain places, then it doesn't matter that they added that clause in it.
So you’re saying the law should change and business to business contracts should require more notice? Or that this is the law now?
Agreed, but I'm not surprised that studios that are already knee deep in a project built in Unity are trying to push back for the short term. Mega Crit might have already 100% decided that they're not going to use Unity for any new projects, but they could have tens of thousands of work hours put into a current project, and trying to port it to a new engine now would very likely add thousands of more hours to it.

It's not the kind of switch that every studio is in a situation to make on a dime.
I don't think there will be any wondering at all. They are 100% not going to use unity for any other future projects, even if this runtime fee thing is completely rolled back.
[removed]
Oh yeah that could be a major issue, especially if not all API calls are 1:1 between engine.
"Hey siri. Buy more grandmas in cookie clicker."
Ah, you're correct. I forgot that part immediately after reading it. Thanks!
Ah, I thought you were trying to say the opposite.
Yeah, they're fucked. This is going to be hilarious.
    I'm pretty sure Microsoft is on the list too. I think they claimed that fee's will be charged to the distributors, so unity games on GamePass. Or Microsoft just pulls Unity based games from their catalog, but time will tell.
        
>I think they claimed that fee's will be charged to the distributors

Which is fucking hysterical, because that means they're also going to try to charge Valve, Epic, EA, CDPR, Sony, Nintendo and a variety other storefronts as well. None of whom have contracts with them. They apparently *want* to be sued by everyone under the sun.

I don't think they even consulted a lawyer, this is so blatantly illegal I'm shocked that they thought this was a good idea.
            Well consider the CEO was trh same EA guy who had bright ideas such as making the player pay money to repair their in-game car and generally made EA look like the greediest, worst gaming company and it starts making sense.

Why a clown like that is still in such a high ranked highly paid position is still baffling
                >Why a clown like that is still in such a high ranked highly paid position is still baffling

He apparently sold off stock like a week or two ago before dropping this. He might end up being investigated by financial regulators at the end of this lol.
                    Bet he's shorting the stock too, or having someone else do it on his behalf.
                > Why a clown like that is still in such a high ranked highly paid position is still baffling

Rich people have benefits us lowly workers don't have, including the advantage of failing your way upwards.
            Yeah, when devs started asking Unity folks how things like gamepass would work with this, the response they got from management was basically "Well we're going to have to sit down and have some discussions with the subscription services about it."

I didn't go to business school, so maybe I'm way off base here, but maybe you should've had those conversations and figured all of this out with the relevant parties before you announce a major change that you say is going to go into effect 4 months from now. 

Microsoft/Valve/Epic/Sony/Apple/Nintendo/etc. are all going to tell Unity to go pound sand if asked to cough up a payment per install. They don't want to have to track that stuff for a third party company, and at this point, there's no way any of them are going to want to wade into this mess on Unity's side.
                Great point. Did they really think the platform holders would be all chill with this?
        Microsoft owns Obsidian now I think, who made Pillars of Eternity 1 & 2 with Unity.
            The Ori games are Unity as well, perhaps even the new game that Moon Studios is working on?

I think Hearthstone is Unity as well? So ActiBlizz also in the boat
Don't forget Microsoft, EA, and Sony. Plus you can probably include Valve, Apple, and Google, as they're the ones distributing the games and thus the ones that somehow need to track unique installs.
You think they don't know this? This is exactly the companies they are going for, the indies are just a nice extra. Unity also has a lot of money, and at some point more money doesn't help you in legal battles. Courts have to decide this, although I have high hopes that this won't fly in europe at all.
All of them with get special exclusive deals that eliminate the fees
And that money will presumably get backup from the plumber's ninjas and the Mouse's legal team. All Unity has done here is given everyone else a target, ironically causing unity in the process.
People also sleep on Game Maker. Games like Hotline Miami, Hyper Light Drifter, and Undertale were made with it. It's a *very* capable engine if smaller scale, 2D stuff is what a dev team is going for.
Godot doesn't have real console support without doing it yourself completely which is why it's not viable for a lot of smaller devs. Unreal is more high end option that is not always suitable for smaller teams.
>It's $0.20 per install. Not per sale, per install.  

I know, I just went with worst assumption in mind (basically sale for 1 game for 1$). Unity said, that they wouldnt make pay for re-install (for same game) AND that they would check for bad actors (how the hell, they will do that, that is a very fucking good question).  

>And this is assuming that Unity somehow manages to put together a decent enough install detection system that means you need to actually buy the game and have a botnet to do this.  

Yes, would love to see how they will implement this.  
I can see this being fine, if using Steam (or any of big launchers), but will see. Either way this is a big L for Unity and its community.
    > Unity said, that they wouldnt make pay for re-install

You'd still need to pay per device though. If someone buys your $1 game and installs it on their PC, their laptop, their phone, their work PC, and their friend's PC, suddenly you owe Unity 100% of that sale. Then they get a new PC and a new phone a year later and suddenly you're losing money on each game.
        >If someone buys your $1 game and installs it on their PC, their laptop, their phone, their work PC, and their friend's PC, suddenly you owe Unity 100% of that sale.  

Yeap, that is the super bad scenario :( Thats why waiting for more info. But it still would require those 200k profit and 200k installs. So at worst, can stop selling game when you get close to 200k sales (if sale is 1$).  
This will hit mobile, f2p markets the most.
Mate, I literally said that I most likely wouldnt.  
I am just saying that if you are solo dev then these changes dont matter for more than 90% of users. Rarely you will see solo dev with 200k in revenue and 200k installs in a year.
FTL too
    FTL will always be number one in my heart
        For as much as I love FTL I sure am terrible at it.
            I think it's one of the hardest roguelikes without being unfun, theres a lot going on in it, both mechanically and in decision making.
            I thought being terrible at it was the point. Are you telling me people are good at it? Unthinkable.

Oh, my crew got spaced again.
            Use pause a lot more, for example pause before missle impact and turn on cloak
        I remember the first time I played FTL. I downloaded it at like 7 PM and figured I would play for a couple of hours and call it a night. When I lifted my head from the game it was 4 AM.
    I unfortunately find the end game of FTL painfully unsatisfying and restrictive. The perfect game is a heavily modded FTL where the player's power level outscales the original game by degrees, and has challenges to match.

Of course the best of those also tell you the final challenges ahead of time, and Oh Hey, that's a Slay the Spire thing. Game so good it fixes other good games.
    What about Streets of Rouge?
No dead cells?! Your subjective opinion is wrong!
    Sorry /u/DeadCellsTop5 the best I can do is 6th place
        Wrong! Lol. I actually have dead cells as my #4 game on my top 25 all-time list. I fucking love that game. I've got Slay the Spire at #9 on the same list, so I fucking love that game too.
            Would you share your top 25 list? I’m curious. Thanks

My rule is only one game per series is allowed, otherwise it's too repetitive with multiple from the same franchise. It's also always changing. This is where I'm at now, though. Not a big RPG guy, nor a Nintendo guy.
                    Your lack of Metal Gear Solid representation is disturbing
    Personally I'd like it more if it forced the player to react to builds more, react to rng. Even with all items unlocked it's not too hard to end up at similar setups in back to back runs, especially with how powerful shops are, let alone with Wish. And the boring stat system ensures you've already committed to a stat before the end of the first level. It is great fun to get in the zone and not drop balanced blade stacks throughout an entire biome, and bosses can be fun in the Goldilocks zone between the struggle bus and instantly vaporizing them with things like baseball bat or half of tactics.

My favorite roguelite currently is Against the Storm by contrast, where playing at a high level is defined by how well you react to the hand you're dealt. StS is also like this at a high level, though some archetypes become near impossible to build past a15.

Edit: To summarize, Dead Cells is a fine action 2d platformer, and not a great roguelite for me.
        I second Against the Storm, it's a mix of a roguelike with the old city builders (Caesar/Pharaoh) where you can actually lose which makes it more appealing than say Two Point Campus where you eventually just win.  Add in the fact that no game feels the same and it's easily one of my picks of this decade.
            I've tried the Against the Storm demo a couple of times and can't get into it? Which is sad because rougelites and city builders are my two favourite genres. Did it take a while for it to 'click' for you?
                It took me a few games to get it to click (like ignore house locations etc) but once the difficulty starts ramping up it has a great gameplay loop.  I'd say it's more old school builder (theme hospital,caesar 3) rather than cities skylines as you're building around the disasters/resources rather than making a nice looking city.  I personally have 221 hours in it so far.
        can you define roguelite for me? feels like we've lost the plot when a city builder is a roguelite.
            How about:

A game where you perform a series of "runs" where each run has a significant amount of randomness. Each run is challenging and failure/death may frequently end the run unsuccessfully. Often, roguelites have some kind of meta-progression between runs. Roguelites are intended to be played many times, rather than once and done, since a lot of content or progression is only unlocked after multiple runs.

Against the Storm is clearly a roguelite imo.
                I would also add that each run isn't particularly long. I think for me, most "runs" when learning cap out at 35 minutes or so. Once I am good at them, under 25 or under 20.
                is tropico a roguelite? randomness, runs, meta progression, gated content.
                    I don't think tropico has the same level of randomness (you can build any/all the same buildings every time, maps and events are handmade for campaign mode) nor is failure/death a significant threat. There also is no progression if you fail. It's just a regular campaign game. Frequent failure is a core part of the experience of roguelites.
            I would define a roguelite as: short run/round/map-focused gameplay, start from scratch each run, high variance in equipment/cards/enemies/objectives/strategy each run, after each run you have meta progression for the next run. Against the storm and slay the spire ticks all these boxes.
            Against the Storm is undoubtedly a roguelite haha, I don't care to quibble about this. It's a roguelite first, the towns you build are extremely temporary in nature, the city-building nature plays second fiddle to the fact that all your buildings and decisions are meant to win the map, not raise a mighty city or empire.
    Can't forget Hades
    Always feel like I'm taking crazy pills because I did not like Dead Cells at all. I play tons of roguelites and Dead Cells would be towards the bottom of the rankings. I found nothing about the game engaging.
        Boy, you crazy! Nah, it's all personal opinion, so it doesn't matter. I find the combat so incredibly satisfying. It's quick, it's snappy, it's predictable. I LOVE the dodge roll and how your can dodge cancel out of nearly any animation. I honestly think it's the best 2D action game out there because the combat is damn near perfect. Then the biomes are all distinct with their own enemy types and the ng+ modes add so much to an already stellar game. Then throw in all of the build possibilities with all the weapons and the multiple branching pathways and it's like roguelite heaven for me.
            See that's the weird thing, my biggest complaint is that I didn't like the combat. Maybe if I unlocked more stuff I would have enjoyed it more - that is kind of a common gripe with roguelites. But yeah the combat from the handful of hours I played just bored me.
                Man, that's crazy to me. That combat is incredible. Pretty much every review praises it. I've never seen anyone complain about the combat before. You should give it another shot, or at least watch some gameplay from a streamer or someone deeper in the game. The weapon variety is insane too.
                    The weapon variety at least at the start of the game seemed really limited. And maybe I just don't actually like 2d action combat lol.
    No Dead Cells and no Hades. 

Hades, Dead Cells and Slay the Spire is the trinity of roguelikes IMO. FTL if it's a quatuor
Enter the Gungeon is clearly the best and it's not even close. This discussion make me realise how many amazing roguelites there are, wow!
    I was going to say the same! Enter the Gungeon on a hypothetical "best roguelite games" list would be the top if not real close to it. The game is just so damn charming on top of some highly addicting gameplay.
        I love the game but it’s too f’ing hard for me. Took me 70 hrs to beat the Dragun and that was with a Sir Junkan lucky but cheesy strat. It was just too hard to get enough time on the lower levels. I didn’t put serious time after the large expansion/patch they did but heard it got balanced a bit smoother.

Edit: also played it on Switch which may have had something to do with it. I was shocked at how much better a Hades player I was on a 144 hz monitor at high res.
And Monster Train, I think the only card roguelite I really liked. There is Erannorth Chronicles but that one is more sandbox than roguelite.
Noita is #1 for me but inno what 2 and 3 are
Risk of Rain 2
Baalorlord (one of the top StS players) said something along the lines of A10 Heart being harder than A20 without Heart. I'm not sure how much I agree with it but it's definitely a massive step up to fight the Heart on any ascension. It's a very befitting boss as the ultimate test of your deck.
    Heart is just ridiculous. You can have a deck that absolutely crushes everything, including the boss before the heart, only to get wiped by the heart in 3 turns. It can be very deflating. Still haven't beaten it with the watcher
        Watcher is a tricky character to play but once you get the hang of her you'll realize she's way stronger than the initial three. She came later and didn't get quite as much balancing, to the point people say she's like a fan made character. The most consistent way to play her is to stance dance, to the point if all you're doing is taking absolutely no cards in Act 1 except Talk to the Hand, Mental Fortress, Tantrum (if you haven't upgraded Eruption yet), 1 Inner Peace or Fear No Evil, and Rushdown and you'll build an infinite which can brute force a win in a small number of attempts.
            I once watched Jorbs go unreasonably far in a Watcher A20 run taking zero cards to make a point. The biggest mistake people make with Watcher is not realizing how strong her starting deck is and adding a bunch of junk to it.
            Watcher being the strongest character is exactly what leads to Watcher runs primarily fizzling at the Heart battle.

Even infinites can fail against heart if you don't find passive block generation as you are forced to tank a LOT of damage across the first three turns no matter what.
            I don't think it's that they didn't balance it as much, it's that her main mechanic of Wrath is one of these things where it's either broken or it feels very bad and not that fun, and they'd rather have Watcher be fun for the average player even if she ends up broken for A20 players.
        lifecoach1981 is currently doing 50 watcher wins in a row on twitch, sitting on 21 right now. maybe you can learn some tricks there (asc 20 ofc) - but be warned, some runs take 8 hours..
            Ages ago when he was a Hearthstone pro he was called "ropecoach" because he always used the maximum turn time to think (the ending countdown is visualized by a rope that burns across the screen)

Looks like some things never change...
                People still meme about him in Hearthstone even though he hasn't been playing the game for like 5 years.
            Is he beating the heart every time? I've beaten the game with the watcher, just not the heart
                Yes, a win = ASC20 including heart. Is at 22 in a row now, just finished his latest run an hour ago :)
        Heart isn't the biggest problem. The problem is the last path towards it. Starts with a resting site which is useless there in terms of healing because you'll heal all the way after the boss anyway. So you can either upgrade one card or if you're lucky and have the relics either get another relic or get more HP. All of these are mostly useless there. Then a merchant, then that Miniboss with the two attacking sides. Those two are already massively dangerous and I mostly go out of that fight with half health. And with that sliver to survive the heart is almost impossible. Would be a whole lot easier if the resting site came after the miniboss.
        I beat the very first heart fight i ever did with the silent, had that relic that revives with 50% HP and forgot about it, also had Fairy in a bottle lol, literally died twice to win, crazy fight.

I beat the boss before the heart in like 4 turns.

It was a Bullet Time, Runic Pyramid run where i would draw 10 cards every turn and Snecko Skull applying like 50 poison per turn, very fun
        Pro tip: To help beat the Heart with Watcher, "see a Talk to the Hand, take a Talk to the Hand"
    Eyy, another Baalorlord enjoyer! I kind of agree with him, tbh. I've got to A20 on every character, but I'm only up to A5 with heart kills (so I can't speak to his exact statement about A10 heart, unfortunately). Act 4 requires different tactics than the rest of the game, to some extent, so building a deck to do it all is an extra challenge.
        What I'm not sure I agree with is how much higher is the jump in difficulty. I'm not sure it's as high as 10 ascensions. That said, he has like 6k more hours than me and the last time I touched A10H was when I was climbing ascensions, so I don't have a good reference to what not fighting the Heart feels like since I always prepared for it.
            Ahh, gotcha! Yeah, I did a climb to 20 first to adjust to the new mechanics at each level before I went into dedicated heart kills. I got a couple here and there on runs I felt were going well, but now I'm counting it as my win condition to ascend.
            I've beaten A20H on all 4 characters multiple times and I dropped down to A10 for fun. I am way more successful at A10H than I am at even getting out of act 2 on A20 lol. Maybe I just suck, but I'd guess for me it'd be like A20 is easier than A17H
Nah, not on A20
I'll check it out. Never played any mods or anything.
It's pretty good. I run into the sticky card problem sometimes and it's worse on iPhone because sometimes you pull up the notification center screen and it minimizes the game. It's a UX issue.

Other than that, performance wise, it's great. STS never crashed, I've never ran into the save issue, STS never locked my phone. FWIW I have an iPhone 14 Pro, but I think it runs great on older phones, as long as it isn't an iPhone SE or an X.
A20 Heart is way too hard. I don’t have the skill to do that. I’ll leave to the pros and streamers. :(
Sounds interesting, I'll give it a look!
If you haven't tried Vault of the Void yet, definitely give it a look. I got into it precisely because you can straight-up start some of the fun gimmicky builds instead of having to build up to them from a boring attack/block deck.
Oh boy… Maybe you should give it more time. At a high level, almost every class can go infinite with their deck rather consistently whether it be infinite damage,block,energy etc. So saying that you’re forced to play with whatever you’re getting when in actual fact the high level play revolves around 1 kind of deck reveals how little you’ve played.
    No, it's not about "forced to play", rather, I usually wanna play some specific build and have some tools to force rng to be more likely to give me needed cards/artifacts/etc. Like, I know that rogue can go into shiv build(and almost auto lose if floor 3 boss is that fucker with 12 cards reset mechanics), the usual draw/discard build(I think last time I beat with that) and with poison. I just want to play poison with that double poison card, but sadly it's locked by lots of runs, which I'd have to play without it, which isn't something I'd want to do.
Hah, fair enough.

And I guess I did the same thing but in reverse, lol.  
My bad, hope I didn't come off full on "akSHuALly" with my reply, not my intention.
What do you mean? I thought Silksong was already out?
    Just a few more months
for mobile games with low returns per user, yes, for a game with a $10+ buy-to-play model that expects hundreds of thousands or millions of sales, no. they'll have a pro or enterprise license, meaning the fee per install will range from 15 cents to 1 cent as they pass each threshold within that monthly period (1 cent at 1M+ downloads with enterprise).

there are many reasons this install fee system is an abysmal idea, but it's not going to put a game like silksong in any financial danger
    My guess is Silksong is also gonna be like $25-30

Edit: and it should be, I'd even pay $40-50 for it tbh
        Hollow Knight is a $60 game for sure. I have more hours in HK than I do in Mario Odyssey
No they don't. You don't realize the scale of the fee compared to the revenue they'll have 

I did some quick calculation in another comment. Basically it's at max 2$ per sale for those BS fees (and likely smaller, that's counting 10 different devices install before the game pass 1M installs which will take a few hours at most). That's not gonna make a game like Silksong lose money. Plus that's for the free tier of Unity. I doubt a studio like Team Cherry (or Mega Crit) is using this after the success of their first games, they have lower royalties on pro licenses

The problem is far more for the small indies that are already not profitable or barely than for those big games that at worst will lose some of their huge profits. But it's important they speak out because they get more attention than random indie studios nobody knows.
hollow knight sold ~2m units and Team Cherry has 3 people. silk song will sell at least that over its lifetime. if these fees somehow make them go in to debt they deserve it for their gross negligence.
    Silksong is also day 1 Game Pass, which is going to add a ton of installs, but no sales no counteract the fees. Anything hitting any of GP/PS+ is hit extra hard by the new model.
        Apparently gamepass installs are (somehow) going to be billed to Microsoft. Good luck collecting on that lmao
            Lmao I am hoping to see them \*try\* to bill Microsoft for that. Microsoft will be more than happy to play that legal game if Unity wants to.
        [deleted]
            Good luck on them trying to get any money from Microsoft who have no contract/agreement with Unity at all.
    it is per install. with free bundles, game pass, people redownloading the game it can easily take all that money
        Look, I think this new model is shitty and Unity deserves to go down in flames over this, but to be fair, Unity clarified that redownloads won't be counted and that devs won't be paying for Game Pass downloads. If they're selling the game for more than 20 cents a copy they won't be losing money on this. There's certainly enough to be outraged about elsewhere.
            they also have no plans on how to do this, dispite saying it I don't trust them one bit
                You're totally right. Unity's "trust us, bro, we know how to count installs fair and square, just don't ask us how" is super shady, and of questionable legality at best.

Meanwhile Unreal is out there saying "oh yeah we go based off your self-reported revenue. We trust you."
And they would be paying extra fees when people redownload hollow Knight to replay it
    No it's just for the first install on a new device. They've changed that. So it's likely only when changing machines (I guess motherboard, that's what identify a PC right?)
        They have failed tell mew machines apart before and have every reason to keep failing
        Or you know, a bad actor running a farm of virtual machines with spoofed hardware IDs and IPs could run a script to continuously install on unique "new" devices to rack up a huge bill for the devs.
            I mean that's going to a long way just to troll someone and no gain for yourself...
                Sure is, but when you're popular enough you're inevitably going to attract people who are angry enough and bored enough with the technical knowhow who would jump at the chance to do something like this. Maybe the devs nerf their favorite playstyle, or take the game in an unpopular direction, or maybe they're just mad the game lets you select pronouns or something. I wouldn't underestimate how far some people would go over spite.
[deleted]
    The math some people have done on the new costs are crazy. Some of the best case scenarios for a *successful* game that costs money and has a moderate player base is around 15%, or triple what Unreal costs *at most*. And there are situations where Unity can cost even more.

Also there's a whole thing of Unity saying distributors will be the ones owing for some cases, like Game Pass, which means there are going to be more headaches because that's questionable legality in the first place.


There are some whose livelihoods depends on what they're working on releasing on time to certain success, but there are tons of devs, universities, etc. already dropping Unity and there's no way I can imagine to win anyone back
        Unity's whole deal is that it's much cheaper than Unreal for a less powerful engine. If it's not even cheaper, why in the world would a dev ever use it again?
            Unity is also better in ease of use, better for mobile development and is better suited for non-3d games than Unreal is. Those are pretty key areas if you are a small indie dev team trying to push, let's say a 2d rougelike card game or an atmospheric 2d metroidvania game with hand drawn sprites to a variety of platforms. That isn't to say there is no alternative to Unity, but Unreal is probably not the go to answer for many devs, especially those who are speaking out the most currently.
10k per month is nothing when you do 500k par month (just random numbers), all is relative. Those big indies or companies using Unity won't have much of a risk there I think. It's for the smaller ones (many indies games are not profitable or barely) that it's a problem
Genshin isn't covered because they have a different license that excludes them from the changes made by Unity Technologies. So even if it was legal to go after other developers, it wouldn't affect Chinese developers either way.
>This move, if someone with some money chooses to fight, could break Unity not only in reputation, but also legally and financially

Let's try Disney, Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, Valve, Epic, CDPR, Humble Bundle, EA, Blizzard, The Pokemon company and more. Unity will no longer exist if they try to enforce this on them. Microsoft could just buy Unity outright and shut them down out of spite.
>  MiHoYo is a chinese studio and foreigners don't enjoy many legal protections over there 

Doesn't matter. Once they set foot in US jurisdiction, they have to obey US law. So they would be sued in US court.

Unless they decide to exit the US market, which I don't think will happen.
>MiHoYo is a chinese studio and foreigners don't enjoy many legal protections over there and b) pulling the TOS rug like that is illegal in many countries, including the entirety of the EU. 

Then thier income based on Android and Apple store can get fucked. Yea the company can do thing but its money from the West would be held.
Then which? The mainline games and Masters use a proprietary engine, Go is simple and portable if the cost of the engine goes up, and Unite is not affected by this change.
    The remakes of diamond and pearl are on unity
        And it's not even the only Nintendo IP affected. Guess what FE Engage was developed in.
            oh boy right I remember that
    Pokémon Brilliant Diamond And Shining Pearl
        Those games are already released though right? It just means nintendo couldn't do updates to them anymore, and I wouldn't expect them to anyways.
            This situation affects games already released. So no not updating them does nothing.
                That seems... totally insane and unenforceable if that's true. The game was already published under the old license. I don't understand how they could try to change the contract agreement on an already developed and published game. It seems... Impossible? Like if there was active development and updates for a game I could see how they could try to collect those fees, but otherwise I don't see how that's possible.
                    Well yeah it is insane and thats why everyone is up in arms
                It's true that the new pricing structure applies to previously released games. However I think it's highly likely that for something as big as the Pokemon games, they made an individual license agreement with Unity ahead of time. Big companies like that don't just create an account on Unity's website and subscribe to a few Pro version seats. They workout their own licensing deals for the engine. This new pricing scheme won't apply to their games.
Acti-blizz legal doesn't fuck around like that. They'll have a custom license.
The sourcing and contract people at my much smaller company wouldn't allow a contract that doesn't have pricing set in very solid stone. Pretty much every contract we have is custom. 

There is no way a large company like blizzard or Nintendo wouldn't have a custom contract.
    They'll be sued into the stone age by Microsoft since they plan to charge them, a company they do not have a contract with, fees per game install. They are outright delusional.
Yes, I used an extreme hypothetical to illustrate the point. That was the entire point of my comment. I'm not here to refute what is or isn't in the contract. I'm saying that just because it's there does not mean it's legally enforceable. A contract isn't some magic spell that lets you do anything you want to. You're responding to the question of "is this legal to do" with the idea that it's in the contract, and that's simply not a legitimate answer.
I don't think you understood what people were telling you. There are authorities above Unity that will enforce their own rules, no matter what the contract says. For example, if you make an online store in Europe and on your ToS you say "by buying in this store you waive your right to refund within 14 days", it doesn't matter. You still have to refund people if they ask you to or they can take you to court in Europe and you will lose. 

So what the other posters were saying is that *if* retroactively applying a ToS is illegal in certain places, then it doesn't matter that they added that clause in it.
I'm pretty sure Microsoft is on the list too. I think they claimed that fee's will be charged to the distributors, so unity games on GamePass. Or Microsoft just pulls Unity based games from their catalog, but time will tell.
    
>I think they claimed that fee's will be charged to the distributors

Which is fucking hysterical, because that means they're also going to try to charge Valve, Epic, EA, CDPR, Sony, Nintendo and a variety other storefronts as well. None of whom have contracts with them. They apparently *want* to be sued by everyone under the sun.

I don't think they even consulted a lawyer, this is so blatantly illegal I'm shocked that they thought this was a good idea.
        Well consider the CEO was trh same EA guy who had bright ideas such as making the player pay money to repair their in-game car and generally made EA look like the greediest, worst gaming company and it starts making sense.

Why a clown like that is still in such a high ranked highly paid position is still baffling
            >Why a clown like that is still in such a high ranked highly paid position is still baffling

He apparently sold off stock like a week or two ago before dropping this. He might end up being investigated by financial regulators at the end of this lol.
                Bet he's shorting the stock too, or having someone else do it on his behalf.
            > Why a clown like that is still in such a high ranked highly paid position is still baffling

Rich people have benefits us lowly workers don't have, including the advantage of failing your way upwards.
        Yeah, when devs started asking Unity folks how things like gamepass would work with this, the response they got from management was basically "Well we're going to have to sit down and have some discussions with the subscription services about it."

I didn't go to business school, so maybe I'm way off base here, but maybe you should've had those conversations and figured all of this out with the relevant parties before you announce a major change that you say is going to go into effect 4 months from now. 

Microsoft/Valve/Epic/Sony/Apple/Nintendo/etc. are all going to tell Unity to go pound sand if asked to cough up a payment per install. They don't want to have to track that stuff for a third party company, and at this point, there's no way any of them are going to want to wade into this mess on Unity's side.
            Great point. Did they really think the platform holders would be all chill with this?
    Microsoft owns Obsidian now I think, who made Pillars of Eternity 1 & 2 with Unity.
        The Ori games are Unity as well, perhaps even the new game that Moon Studios is working on?

I think Hearthstone is Unity as well? So ActiBlizz also in the boat
> Unity said, that they wouldnt make pay for re-install

You'd still need to pay per device though. If someone buys your $1 game and installs it on their PC, their laptop, their phone, their work PC, and their friend's PC, suddenly you owe Unity 100% of that sale. Then they get a new PC and a new phone a year later and suddenly you're losing money on each game.
    >If someone buys your $1 game and installs it on their PC, their laptop, their phone, their work PC, and their friend's PC, suddenly you owe Unity 100% of that sale.  

Yeap, that is the super bad scenario :( Thats why waiting for more info. But it still would require those 200k profit and 200k installs. So at worst, can stop selling game when you get close to 200k sales (if sale is 1$).  
This will hit mobile, f2p markets the most.
FTL will always be number one in my heart
    For as much as I love FTL I sure am terrible at it.
        I think it's one of the hardest roguelikes without being unfun, theres a lot going on in it, both mechanically and in decision making.
        I thought being terrible at it was the point. Are you telling me people are good at it? Unthinkable.

Oh, my crew got spaced again.
        Use pause a lot more, for example pause before missle impact and turn on cloak
    I remember the first time I played FTL. I downloaded it at like 7 PM and figured I would play for a couple of hours and call it a night. When I lifted my head from the game it was 4 AM.
I unfortunately find the end game of FTL painfully unsatisfying and restrictive. The perfect game is a heavily modded FTL where the player's power level outscales the original game by degrees, and has challenges to match.

Of course the best of those also tell you the final challenges ahead of time, and Oh Hey, that's a Slay the Spire thing. Game so good it fixes other good games.
What about Streets of Rouge?
Sorry /u/DeadCellsTop5 the best I can do is 6th place
    Wrong! Lol. I actually have dead cells as my #4 game on my top 25 all-time list. I fucking love that game. I've got Slay the Spire at #9 on the same list, so I fucking love that game too.
        Would you share your top 25 list? I’m curious. Thanks

My rule is only one game per series is allowed, otherwise it's too repetitive with multiple from the same franchise. It's also always changing. This is where I'm at now, though. Not a big RPG guy, nor a Nintendo guy.
                Your lack of Metal Gear Solid representation is disturbing
Personally I'd like it more if it forced the player to react to builds more, react to rng. Even with all items unlocked it's not too hard to end up at similar setups in back to back runs, especially with how powerful shops are, let alone with Wish. And the boring stat system ensures you've already committed to a stat before the end of the first level. It is great fun to get in the zone and not drop balanced blade stacks throughout an entire biome, and bosses can be fun in the Goldilocks zone between the struggle bus and instantly vaporizing them with things like baseball bat or half of tactics.

My favorite roguelite currently is Against the Storm by contrast, where playing at a high level is defined by how well you react to the hand you're dealt. StS is also like this at a high level, though some archetypes become near impossible to build past a15.

Edit: To summarize, Dead Cells is a fine action 2d platformer, and not a great roguelite for me.
    I second Against the Storm, it's a mix of a roguelike with the old city builders (Caesar/Pharaoh) where you can actually lose which makes it more appealing than say Two Point Campus where you eventually just win.  Add in the fact that no game feels the same and it's easily one of my picks of this decade.
        I've tried the Against the Storm demo a couple of times and can't get into it? Which is sad because rougelites and city builders are my two favourite genres. Did it take a while for it to 'click' for you?
            It took me a few games to get it to click (like ignore house locations etc) but once the difficulty starts ramping up it has a great gameplay loop.  I'd say it's more old school builder (theme hospital,caesar 3) rather than cities skylines as you're building around the disasters/resources rather than making a nice looking city.  I personally have 221 hours in it so far.
    can you define roguelite for me? feels like we've lost the plot when a city builder is a roguelite.
        How about:

A game where you perform a series of "runs" where each run has a significant amount of randomness. Each run is challenging and failure/death may frequently end the run unsuccessfully. Often, roguelites have some kind of meta-progression between runs. Roguelites are intended to be played many times, rather than once and done, since a lot of content or progression is only unlocked after multiple runs.

Against the Storm is clearly a roguelite imo.
            I would also add that each run isn't particularly long. I think for me, most "runs" when learning cap out at 35 minutes or so. Once I am good at them, under 25 or under 20.
            is tropico a roguelite? randomness, runs, meta progression, gated content.
                I don't think tropico has the same level of randomness (you can build any/all the same buildings every time, maps and events are handmade for campaign mode) nor is failure/death a significant threat. There also is no progression if you fail. It's just a regular campaign game. Frequent failure is a core part of the experience of roguelites.
        I would define a roguelite as: short run/round/map-focused gameplay, start from scratch each run, high variance in equipment/cards/enemies/objectives/strategy each run, after each run you have meta progression for the next run. Against the storm and slay the spire ticks all these boxes.
        Against the Storm is undoubtedly a roguelite haha, I don't care to quibble about this. It's a roguelite first, the towns you build are extremely temporary in nature, the city-building nature plays second fiddle to the fact that all your buildings and decisions are meant to win the map, not raise a mighty city or empire.
Can't forget Hades
Always feel like I'm taking crazy pills because I did not like Dead Cells at all. I play tons of roguelites and Dead Cells would be towards the bottom of the rankings. I found nothing about the game engaging.
    Boy, you crazy! Nah, it's all personal opinion, so it doesn't matter. I find the combat so incredibly satisfying. It's quick, it's snappy, it's predictable. I LOVE the dodge roll and how your can dodge cancel out of nearly any animation. I honestly think it's the best 2D action game out there because the combat is damn near perfect. Then the biomes are all distinct with their own enemy types and the ng+ modes add so much to an already stellar game. Then throw in all of the build possibilities with all the weapons and the multiple branching pathways and it's like roguelite heaven for me.
        See that's the weird thing, my biggest complaint is that I didn't like the combat. Maybe if I unlocked more stuff I would have enjoyed it more - that is kind of a common gripe with roguelites. But yeah the combat from the handful of hours I played just bored me.
            Man, that's crazy to me. That combat is incredible. Pretty much every review praises it. I've never seen anyone complain about the combat before. You should give it another shot, or at least watch some gameplay from a streamer or someone deeper in the game. The weapon variety is insane too.
                The weapon variety at least at the start of the game seemed really limited. And maybe I just don't actually like 2d action combat lol.
No Dead Cells and no Hades. 

Hades, Dead Cells and Slay the Spire is the trinity of roguelikes IMO. FTL if it's a quatuor
I was going to say the same! Enter the Gungeon on a hypothetical "best roguelite games" list would be the top if not real close to it. The game is just so damn charming on top of some highly addicting gameplay.
    I love the game but it’s too f’ing hard for me. Took me 70 hrs to beat the Dragun and that was with a Sir Junkan lucky but cheesy strat. It was just too hard to get enough time on the lower levels. I didn’t put serious time after the large expansion/patch they did but heard it got balanced a bit smoother.

Edit: also played it on Switch which may have had something to do with it. I was shocked at how much better a Hades player I was on a 144 hz monitor at high res.
Heart is just ridiculous. You can have a deck that absolutely crushes everything, including the boss before the heart, only to get wiped by the heart in 3 turns. It can be very deflating. Still haven't beaten it with the watcher
    Watcher is a tricky character to play but once you get the hang of her you'll realize she's way stronger than the initial three. She came later and didn't get quite as much balancing, to the point people say she's like a fan made character. The most consistent way to play her is to stance dance, to the point if all you're doing is taking absolutely no cards in Act 1 except Talk to the Hand, Mental Fortress, Tantrum (if you haven't upgraded Eruption yet), 1 Inner Peace or Fear No Evil, and Rushdown and you'll build an infinite which can brute force a win in a small number of attempts.
        I once watched Jorbs go unreasonably far in a Watcher A20 run taking zero cards to make a point. The biggest mistake people make with Watcher is not realizing how strong her starting deck is and adding a bunch of junk to it.
        Watcher being the strongest character is exactly what leads to Watcher runs primarily fizzling at the Heart battle.

Even infinites can fail against heart if you don't find passive block generation as you are forced to tank a LOT of damage across the first three turns no matter what.
        I don't think it's that they didn't balance it as much, it's that her main mechanic of Wrath is one of these things where it's either broken or it feels very bad and not that fun, and they'd rather have Watcher be fun for the average player even if she ends up broken for A20 players.
    lifecoach1981 is currently doing 50 watcher wins in a row on twitch, sitting on 21 right now. maybe you can learn some tricks there (asc 20 ofc) - but be warned, some runs take 8 hours..
        Ages ago when he was a Hearthstone pro he was called "ropecoach" because he always used the maximum turn time to think (the ending countdown is visualized by a rope that burns across the screen)

Looks like some things never change...
            People still meme about him in Hearthstone even though he hasn't been playing the game for like 5 years.
        Is he beating the heart every time? I've beaten the game with the watcher, just not the heart
            Yes, a win = ASC20 including heart. Is at 22 in a row now, just finished his latest run an hour ago :)
    Heart isn't the biggest problem. The problem is the last path towards it. Starts with a resting site which is useless there in terms of healing because you'll heal all the way after the boss anyway. So you can either upgrade one card or if you're lucky and have the relics either get another relic or get more HP. All of these are mostly useless there. Then a merchant, then that Miniboss with the two attacking sides. Those two are already massively dangerous and I mostly go out of that fight with half health. And with that sliver to survive the heart is almost impossible. Would be a whole lot easier if the resting site came after the miniboss.
    I beat the very first heart fight i ever did with the silent, had that relic that revives with 50% HP and forgot about it, also had Fairy in a bottle lol, literally died twice to win, crazy fight.

I beat the boss before the heart in like 4 turns.

It was a Bullet Time, Runic Pyramid run where i would draw 10 cards every turn and Snecko Skull applying like 50 poison per turn, very fun
    Pro tip: To help beat the Heart with Watcher, "see a Talk to the Hand, take a Talk to the Hand"
Eyy, another Baalorlord enjoyer! I kind of agree with him, tbh. I've got to A20 on every character, but I'm only up to A5 with heart kills (so I can't speak to his exact statement about A10 heart, unfortunately). Act 4 requires different tactics than the rest of the game, to some extent, so building a deck to do it all is an extra challenge.
    What I'm not sure I agree with is how much higher is the jump in difficulty. I'm not sure it's as high as 10 ascensions. That said, he has like 6k more hours than me and the last time I touched A10H was when I was climbing ascensions, so I don't have a good reference to what not fighting the Heart feels like since I always prepared for it.
        Ahh, gotcha! Yeah, I did a climb to 20 first to adjust to the new mechanics at each level before I went into dedicated heart kills. I got a couple here and there on runs I felt were going well, but now I'm counting it as my win condition to ascend.
        I've beaten A20H on all 4 characters multiple times and I dropped down to A10 for fun. I am way more successful at A10H than I am at even getting out of act 2 on A20 lol. Maybe I just suck, but I'd guess for me it'd be like A20 is easier than A17H
No, it's not about "forced to play", rather, I usually wanna play some specific build and have some tools to force rng to be more likely to give me needed cards/artifacts/etc. Like, I know that rogue can go into shiv build(and almost auto lose if floor 3 boss is that fucker with 12 cards reset mechanics), the usual draw/discard build(I think last time I beat with that) and with poison. I just want to play poison with that double poison card, but sadly it's locked by lots of runs, which I'd have to play without it, which isn't something I'd want to do.
Just a few more months
My guess is Silksong is also gonna be like $25-30

Edit: and it should be, I'd even pay $40-50 for it tbh
    Hollow Knight is a $60 game for sure. I have more hours in HK than I do in Mario Odyssey
Silksong is also day 1 Game Pass, which is going to add a ton of installs, but no sales no counteract the fees. Anything hitting any of GP/PS+ is hit extra hard by the new model.
    Apparently gamepass installs are (somehow) going to be billed to Microsoft. Good luck collecting on that lmao
        Lmao I am hoping to see them \*try\* to bill Microsoft for that. Microsoft will be more than happy to play that legal game if Unity wants to.
    [deleted]
        Good luck on them trying to get any money from Microsoft who have no contract/agreement with Unity at all.
it is per install. with free bundles, game pass, people redownloading the game it can easily take all that money
    Look, I think this new model is shitty and Unity deserves to go down in flames over this, but to be fair, Unity clarified that redownloads won't be counted and that devs won't be paying for Game Pass downloads. If they're selling the game for more than 20 cents a copy they won't be losing money on this. There's certainly enough to be outraged about elsewhere.
        they also have no plans on how to do this, dispite saying it I don't trust them one bit
            You're totally right. Unity's "trust us, bro, we know how to count installs fair and square, just don't ask us how" is super shady, and of questionable legality at best.

Meanwhile Unreal is out there saying "oh yeah we go based off your self-reported revenue. We trust you."
No it's just for the first install on a new device. They've changed that. So it's likely only when changing machines (I guess motherboard, that's what identify a PC right?)
    They have failed tell mew machines apart before and have every reason to keep failing
    Or you know, a bad actor running a farm of virtual machines with spoofed hardware IDs and IPs could run a script to continuously install on unique "new" devices to rack up a huge bill for the devs.
        I mean that's going to a long way just to troll someone and no gain for yourself...
            Sure is, but when you're popular enough you're inevitably going to attract people who are angry enough and bored enough with the technical knowhow who would jump at the chance to do something like this. Maybe the devs nerf their favorite playstyle, or take the game in an unpopular direction, or maybe they're just mad the game lets you select pronouns or something. I wouldn't underestimate how far some people would go over spite.
The math some people have done on the new costs are crazy. Some of the best case scenarios for a *successful* game that costs money and has a moderate player base is around 15%, or triple what Unreal costs *at most*. And there are situations where Unity can cost even more.

Also there's a whole thing of Unity saying distributors will be the ones owing for some cases, like Game Pass, which means there are going to be more headaches because that's questionable legality in the first place.


There are some whose livelihoods depends on what they're working on releasing on time to certain success, but there are tons of devs, universities, etc. already dropping Unity and there's no way I can imagine to win anyone back
    Unity's whole deal is that it's much cheaper than Unreal for a less powerful engine. If it's not even cheaper, why in the world would a dev ever use it again?
        Unity is also better in ease of use, better for mobile development and is better suited for non-3d games than Unreal is. Those are pretty key areas if you are a small indie dev team trying to push, let's say a 2d rougelike card game or an atmospheric 2d metroidvania game with hand drawn sprites to a variety of platforms. That isn't to say there is no alternative to Unity, but Unreal is probably not the go to answer for many devs, especially those who are speaking out the most currently.
The remakes of diamond and pearl are on unity
    And it's not even the only Nintendo IP affected. Guess what FE Engage was developed in.
        oh boy right I remember that
Pokémon Brilliant Diamond And Shining Pearl
    Those games are already released though right? It just means nintendo couldn't do updates to them anymore, and I wouldn't expect them to anyways.
        This situation affects games already released. So no not updating them does nothing.
            That seems... totally insane and unenforceable if that's true. The game was already published under the old license. I don't understand how they could try to change the contract agreement on an already developed and published game. It seems... Impossible? Like if there was active development and updates for a game I could see how they could try to collect those fees, but otherwise I don't see how that's possible.
                Well yeah it is insane and thats why everyone is up in arms
            It's true that the new pricing structure applies to previously released games. However I think it's highly likely that for something as big as the Pokemon games, they made an individual license agreement with Unity ahead of time. Big companies like that don't just create an account on Unity's website and subscribe to a few Pro version seats. They workout their own licensing deals for the engine. This new pricing scheme won't apply to their games.
They'll be sued into the stone age by Microsoft since they plan to charge them, a company they do not have a contract with, fees per game install. They are outright delusional.

>I think they claimed that fee's will be charged to the distributors

Which is fucking hysterical, because that means they're also going to try to charge Valve, Epic, EA, CDPR, Sony, Nintendo and a variety other storefronts as well. None of whom have contracts with them. They apparently *want* to be sued by everyone under the sun.

I don't think they even consulted a lawyer, this is so blatantly illegal I'm shocked that they thought this was a good idea.
    Well consider the CEO was trh same EA guy who had bright ideas such as making the player pay money to repair their in-game car and generally made EA look like the greediest, worst gaming company and it starts making sense.

Why a clown like that is still in such a high ranked highly paid position is still baffling
        >Why a clown like that is still in such a high ranked highly paid position is still baffling

He apparently sold off stock like a week or two ago before dropping this. He might end up being investigated by financial regulators at the end of this lol.
            Bet he's shorting the stock too, or having someone else do it on his behalf.
        > Why a clown like that is still in such a high ranked highly paid position is still baffling

Rich people have benefits us lowly workers don't have, including the advantage of failing your way upwards.
    Yeah, when devs started asking Unity folks how things like gamepass would work with this, the response they got from management was basically "Well we're going to have to sit down and have some discussions with the subscription services about it."

I didn't go to business school, so maybe I'm way off base here, but maybe you should've had those conversations and figured all of this out with the relevant parties before you announce a major change that you say is going to go into effect 4 months from now. 

Microsoft/Valve/Epic/Sony/Apple/Nintendo/etc. are all going to tell Unity to go pound sand if asked to cough up a payment per install. They don't want to have to track that stuff for a third party company, and at this point, there's no way any of them are going to want to wade into this mess on Unity's side.
        Great point. Did they really think the platform holders would be all chill with this?
Microsoft owns Obsidian now I think, who made Pillars of Eternity 1 & 2 with Unity.
    The Ori games are Unity as well, perhaps even the new game that Moon Studios is working on?

I think Hearthstone is Unity as well? So ActiBlizz also in the boat
>If someone buys your $1 game and installs it on their PC, their laptop, their phone, their work PC, and their friend's PC, suddenly you owe Unity 100% of that sale.  

Yeap, that is the super bad scenario :( Thats why waiting for more info. But it still would require those 200k profit and 200k installs. So at worst, can stop selling game when you get close to 200k sales (if sale is 1$).  
This will hit mobile, f2p markets the most.
For as much as I love FTL I sure am terrible at it.
    I think it's one of the hardest roguelikes without being unfun, theres a lot going on in it, both mechanically and in decision making.
    I thought being terrible at it was the point. Are you telling me people are good at it? Unthinkable.

Oh, my crew got spaced again.
    Use pause a lot more, for example pause before missle impact and turn on cloak
I remember the first time I played FTL. I downloaded it at like 7 PM and figured I would play for a couple of hours and call it a night. When I lifted my head from the game it was 4 AM.
Wrong! Lol. I actually have dead cells as my #4 game on my top 25 all-time list. I fucking love that game. I've got Slay the Spire at #9 on the same list, so I fucking love that game too.
    Would you share your top 25 list? I’m curious. Thanks

My rule is only one game per series is allowed, otherwise it's too repetitive with multiple from the same franchise. It's also always changing. This is where I'm at now, though. Not a big RPG guy, nor a Nintendo guy.
            Your lack of Metal Gear Solid representation is disturbing
I second Against the Storm, it's a mix of a roguelike with the old city builders (Caesar/Pharaoh) where you can actually lose which makes it more appealing than say Two Point Campus where you eventually just win.  Add in the fact that no game feels the same and it's easily one of my picks of this decade.
    I've tried the Against the Storm demo a couple of times and can't get into it? Which is sad because rougelites and city builders are my two favourite genres. Did it take a while for it to 'click' for you?
        It took me a few games to get it to click (like ignore house locations etc) but once the difficulty starts ramping up it has a great gameplay loop.  I'd say it's more old school builder (theme hospital,caesar 3) rather than cities skylines as you're building around the disasters/resources rather than making a nice looking city.  I personally have 221 hours in it so far.
can you define roguelite for me? feels like we've lost the plot when a city builder is a roguelite.
    How about:

A game where you perform a series of "runs" where each run has a significant amount of randomness. Each run is challenging and failure/death may frequently end the run unsuccessfully. Often, roguelites have some kind of meta-progression between runs. Roguelites are intended to be played many times, rather than once and done, since a lot of content or progression is only unlocked after multiple runs.

Against the Storm is clearly a roguelite imo.
        I would also add that each run isn't particularly long. I think for me, most "runs" when learning cap out at 35 minutes or so. Once I am good at them, under 25 or under 20.
        is tropico a roguelite? randomness, runs, meta progression, gated content.
            I don't think tropico has the same level of randomness (you can build any/all the same buildings every time, maps and events are handmade for campaign mode) nor is failure/death a significant threat. There also is no progression if you fail. It's just a regular campaign game. Frequent failure is a core part of the experience of roguelites.
    I would define a roguelite as: short run/round/map-focused gameplay, start from scratch each run, high variance in equipment/cards/enemies/objectives/strategy each run, after each run you have meta progression for the next run. Against the storm and slay the spire ticks all these boxes.
    Against the Storm is undoubtedly a roguelite haha, I don't care to quibble about this. It's a roguelite first, the towns you build are extremely temporary in nature, the city-building nature plays second fiddle to the fact that all your buildings and decisions are meant to win the map, not raise a mighty city or empire.
Boy, you crazy! Nah, it's all personal opinion, so it doesn't matter. I find the combat so incredibly satisfying. It's quick, it's snappy, it's predictable. I LOVE the dodge roll and how your can dodge cancel out of nearly any animation. I honestly think it's the best 2D action game out there because the combat is damn near perfect. Then the biomes are all distinct with their own enemy types and the ng+ modes add so much to an already stellar game. Then throw in all of the build possibilities with all the weapons and the multiple branching pathways and it's like roguelite heaven for me.
    See that's the weird thing, my biggest complaint is that I didn't like the combat. Maybe if I unlocked more stuff I would have enjoyed it more - that is kind of a common gripe with roguelites. But yeah the combat from the handful of hours I played just bored me.
        Man, that's crazy to me. That combat is incredible. Pretty much every review praises it. I've never seen anyone complain about the combat before. You should give it another shot, or at least watch some gameplay from a streamer or someone deeper in the game. The weapon variety is insane too.
            The weapon variety at least at the start of the game seemed really limited. And maybe I just don't actually like 2d action combat lol.
I love the game but it’s too f’ing hard for me. Took me 70 hrs to beat the Dragun and that was with a Sir Junkan lucky but cheesy strat. It was just too hard to get enough time on the lower levels. I didn’t put serious time after the large expansion/patch they did but heard it got balanced a bit smoother.

Edit: also played it on Switch which may have had something to do with it. I was shocked at how much better a Hades player I was on a 144 hz monitor at high res.
Watcher is a tricky character to play but once you get the hang of her you'll realize she's way stronger than the initial three. She came later and didn't get quite as much balancing, to the point people say she's like a fan made character. The most consistent way to play her is to stance dance, to the point if all you're doing is taking absolutely no cards in Act 1 except Talk to the Hand, Mental Fortress, Tantrum (if you haven't upgraded Eruption yet), 1 Inner Peace or Fear No Evil, and Rushdown and you'll build an infinite which can brute force a win in a small number of attempts.
    I once watched Jorbs go unreasonably far in a Watcher A20 run taking zero cards to make a point. The biggest mistake people make with Watcher is not realizing how strong her starting deck is and adding a bunch of junk to it.
    Watcher being the strongest character is exactly what leads to Watcher runs primarily fizzling at the Heart battle.

Even infinites can fail against heart if you don't find passive block generation as you are forced to tank a LOT of damage across the first three turns no matter what.
    I don't think it's that they didn't balance it as much, it's that her main mechanic of Wrath is one of these things where it's either broken or it feels very bad and not that fun, and they'd rather have Watcher be fun for the average player even if she ends up broken for A20 players.
lifecoach1981 is currently doing 50 watcher wins in a row on twitch, sitting on 21 right now. maybe you can learn some tricks there (asc 20 ofc) - but be warned, some runs take 8 hours..
    Ages ago when he was a Hearthstone pro he was called "ropecoach" because he always used the maximum turn time to think (the ending countdown is visualized by a rope that burns across the screen)

Looks like some things never change...
        People still meme about him in Hearthstone even though he hasn't been playing the game for like 5 years.
    Is he beating the heart every time? I've beaten the game with the watcher, just not the heart
        Yes, a win = ASC20 including heart. Is at 22 in a row now, just finished his latest run an hour ago :)
Heart isn't the biggest problem. The problem is the last path towards it. Starts with a resting site which is useless there in terms of healing because you'll heal all the way after the boss anyway. So you can either upgrade one card or if you're lucky and have the relics either get another relic or get more HP. All of these are mostly useless there. Then a merchant, then that Miniboss with the two attacking sides. Those two are already massively dangerous and I mostly go out of that fight with half health. And with that sliver to survive the heart is almost impossible. Would be a whole lot easier if the resting site came after the miniboss.
I beat the very first heart fight i ever did with the silent, had that relic that revives with 50% HP and forgot about it, also had Fairy in a bottle lol, literally died twice to win, crazy fight.

I beat the boss before the heart in like 4 turns.

It was a Bullet Time, Runic Pyramid run where i would draw 10 cards every turn and Snecko Skull applying like 50 poison per turn, very fun
Pro tip: To help beat the Heart with Watcher, "see a Talk to the Hand, take a Talk to the Hand"
What I'm not sure I agree with is how much higher is the jump in difficulty. I'm not sure it's as high as 10 ascensions. That said, he has like 6k more hours than me and the last time I touched A10H was when I was climbing ascensions, so I don't have a good reference to what not fighting the Heart feels like since I always prepared for it.
    Ahh, gotcha! Yeah, I did a climb to 20 first to adjust to the new mechanics at each level before I went into dedicated heart kills. I got a couple here and there on runs I felt were going well, but now I'm counting it as my win condition to ascend.
    I've beaten A20H on all 4 characters multiple times and I dropped down to A10 for fun. I am way more successful at A10H than I am at even getting out of act 2 on A20 lol. Maybe I just suck, but I'd guess for me it'd be like A20 is easier than A17H
Hollow Knight is a $60 game for sure. I have more hours in HK than I do in Mario Odyssey

Even infinites can fail against heart if you don't find passive block generation as you are forced to tank a LOT of damage across the first three turns no matter what.
I don't think it's that they didn't balance it as much, it's that her main mechanic of Wrath is one of these things where it's either broken or it feels very bad and not that fun, and they'd rather have Watcher be fun for the average player even if she ends up broken for A20 players.
Ages ago when he was a Hearthstone pro he was called "ropecoach" because he always used the maximum turn time to think (the ending countdown is visualized by a rope that burns across the screen)

Looks like some things never change...
    People still meme about him in Hearthstone even though he hasn't been playing the game for like 5 years.
Is he beating the heart every time? I've beaten the game with the watcher, just not the heart
    Yes, a win = ASC20 including heart. Is at 22 in a row now, just finished his latest run an hour ago :)
Ahh, gotcha! Yeah, I did a climb to 20 first to adjust to the new mechanics at each level before I went into dedicated heart kills. I got a couple here and there on runs I felt were going well, but now I'm counting it as my win condition to ascend.
I've beaten A20H on all 4 characters multiple times and I dropped down to A10 for fun. I am way more successful at A10H than I am at even getting out of act 2 on A20 lol. Maybe I just suck, but I'd guess for me it'd be like A20 is easier than A17H
Lmao I am hoping to see them \*try\* to bill Microsoft for that. Microsoft will be more than happy to play that legal game if Unity wants to.
Good luck on them trying to get any money from Microsoft who have no contract/agreement with Unity at all.
they also have no plans on how to do this, dispite saying it I don't trust them one bit
    You're totally right. Unity's "trust us, bro, we know how to count installs fair and square, just don't ask us how" is super shady, and of questionable legality at best.

Meanwhile Unreal is out there saying "oh yeah we go based off your self-reported revenue. We trust you."
I mean that's going to a long way just to troll someone and no gain for yourself...
    Sure is, but when you're popular enough you're inevitably going to attract people who are angry enough and bored enough with the technical knowhow who would jump at the chance to do something like this. Maybe the devs nerf their favorite playstyle, or take the game in an unpopular direction, or maybe they're just mad the game lets you select pronouns or something. I wouldn't underestimate how far some people would go over spite.
Unity is also better in ease of use, better for mobile development and is better suited for non-3d games than Unreal is. Those are pretty key areas if you are a small indie dev team trying to push, let's say a 2d rougelike card game or an atmospheric 2d metroidvania game with hand drawn sprites to a variety of platforms. That isn't to say there is no alternative to Unity, but Unreal is probably not the go to answer for many devs, especially those who are speaking out the most currently.
oh boy right I remember that
This situation affects games already released. So no not updating them does nothing.
    That seems... totally insane and unenforceable if that's true. The game was already published under the old license. I don't understand how they could try to change the contract agreement on an already developed and published game. It seems... Impossible? Like if there was active development and updates for a game I could see how they could try to collect those fees, but otherwise I don't see how that's possible.
        Well yeah it is insane and thats why everyone is up in arms
    It's true that the new pricing structure applies to previously released games. However I think it's highly likely that for something as big as the Pokemon games, they made an individual license agreement with Unity ahead of time. Big companies like that don't just create an account on Unity's website and subscribe to a few Pro version seats. They workout their own licensing deals for the engine. This new pricing scheme won't apply to their games.
>Why a clown like that is still in such a high ranked highly paid position is still baffling

He apparently sold off stock like a week or two ago before dropping this. He might end up being investigated by financial regulators at the end of this lol.
    Bet he's shorting the stock too, or having someone else do it on his behalf.

Rich people have benefits us lowly workers don't have, including the advantage of failing your way upwards.
Great point. Did they really think the platform holders would be all chill with this?

My rule is only one game per series is allowed, otherwise it's too repetitive with multiple from the same franchise. It's also always changing. This is where I'm at now, though. Not a big RPG guy, nor a Nintendo guy.
    Your lack of Metal Gear Solid representation is disturbing
It took me a few games to get it to click (like ignore house locations etc) but once the difficulty starts ramping up it has a great gameplay loop.  I'd say it's more old school builder (theme hospital,caesar 3) rather than cities skylines as you're building around the disasters/resources rather than making a nice looking city.  I personally have 221 hours in it so far.
I would also add that each run isn't particularly long. I think for me, most "runs" when learning cap out at 35 minutes or so. Once I am good at them, under 25 or under 20.
is tropico a roguelite? randomness, runs, meta progression, gated content.
    I don't think tropico has the same level of randomness (you can build any/all the same buildings every time, maps and events are handmade for campaign mode) nor is failure/death a significant threat. There also is no progression if you fail. It's just a regular campaign game. Frequent failure is a core part of the experience of roguelites.
Man, that's crazy to me. That combat is incredible. Pretty much every review praises it. I've never seen anyone complain about the combat before. You should give it another shot, or at least watch some gameplay from a streamer or someone deeper in the game. The weapon variety is insane too.
    The weapon variety at least at the start of the game seemed really limited. And maybe I just don't actually like 2d action combat lol.
