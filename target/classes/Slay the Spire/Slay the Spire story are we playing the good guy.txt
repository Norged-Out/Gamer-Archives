[[Slay the Spire story are we playing the good guy]]


AFAIK Slay the Spire has no real story. If I missed something or it's an often discussed toppic I appologize. 

We play pretty unknown generic heros who fight "the evil" in a perpetuing "Groundhog Day" like scenario. But since the game isn't complete there might be a story that isn't revealed yet. I don't expect them to create a complex story or lore but I have the feeling that there might be a story twist in the final game (for example when you beat asc15).

After all we don't know why the heart is considered evil. You meet some pretty unpleasand foes on your way like thievs and slavers. But on the other hand you are the guy who attacks them at their home, murders and robs everyone, kills animals and starts to attack a sleeping Lagavulin. Your enemys daze you while you poison them and when you attack the evil heart it puts you to sleep. The Bird Guy and the Stone Head sound like bullies ("you don't belong here") but they could simply mean "leave us alone". When you read the character descriptions of Ironclad and Silent they also don't sound like archetypical good guys and we don't even see their faces.

What do you think? Are we playing the actual evil guy?


Whether you're good or bad really depends on Neow and why it was imprisoned at the bottom of the spire. Could be that whalebro is relatively innocent or harmless, but it being a god of resurrection would suggest it probably isn't and that the reason it isn't dead is because it can't die.

You're a tool for Neow's revenge, so really it depends on what the Spire is and why attacking its heart over and over again is Neow's gain. Is the spire good or bad for the world outside? Are the bird cult involved in Neow's imprisonment and it's just some religious conflict? Why does Neow reasonably expect you to "at least slay the first boss" on Ascension 15 when it gives you Tiny House as your starting relic? 

All valid questions.
    Yeah, I think Neow gets bored and just wants to resurrect more frustrated people when he goes Tiny House
        If he's feeling particularly cheeky he gives you Philosopher's Stone and you inevitably run into slimes and byrds.

    Right, I missed that Neow "brings you back", so you probably die when you attack the spires heart. And since he uses you he could at least be a little more generous with his blessing.

Are there other threats that discuss the topic? The game somehow tickles my plot twist nerves.
        check the events. memories and masks (Death masks?) are both major themes.

    Just FYI, if you didn't know already, you don't have to reach the first boss on ascension. If you die before the first boss (looking at you gremlin nob) you can turn off ascension, get to the boss, reset, then go back on ascension
Don't ever give up! - Gremlin leader as you murder all those poor innocent gremlins.
There's a new event they added where you character remembers something from their past. The one for Ironclad involved [a whole village dead, presumably his fault.](/spoiler)

So it wouldn't surprise me if you're not the good guy. That being said, you fight enemies with names like "Slaver" so it's quite possible there are no good guys here.
    My personal theory of that event is that it's a case of monkey's paw wish fulfillment. [The Ironclad wanted to become the strongest Ironclad and the demon fulfilled that by making him the only Ironclad.](/spoiler) Also some of the relics mention Spireblight which implies the Spire wiped out surrounding life so I definitely wouldn't put the Spire on the good side.

Seeing the size of the heart, we could actually be in a body rather than some sort of dungeon.

Neow being an infectious agent (think cancer tumor) spreading you to the heart (explaining how he brings you back again and again). Ennemies you encounter are antibodies you fight adapting to them (building a deck, learning from die and retry) trying to get rid of you ("you don't belong here").

The thing you're killing could be yourself, seeing how the win screen looks like the failure screen (same music, mood, you fainting/dying) 
Good, bad, I'm the guy with the ~~gun~~ giant sword
there is a saying that every character is the hero of their own story. evil and good is all about perspective. so really there is no answer. 

as for the story, there isnt any at the moment, the game is in early access still so they probably havent put in the lore of the game yet. though this type of game doesnt usually come with much lore. the lore usually develops after the game is built. 

there are some story aspects in the game, like the new event that talks about how the silent gets her skull head piece. i'll let you discover which event that one is. 
We're playing as Neow's puppets. Neow seems to have some sort of vendetta against the Spire and resurrection powers, but her reasons for doing so aren't known. The beings of the spire are aware to varying extents that this is happening. It's not a groundhog scenario, it's that win or lose, you die (at the moment) are resurrected by Neow, and sent back up to try and Slay The Spire
I think the "heroes" are being used. Neow isn't a good guy (gal actually) but I'm not convinced the Spire isnt "evil" as well.
Would be interesting to see more floors to the spire open up as the heart takes X amount of damage total.
