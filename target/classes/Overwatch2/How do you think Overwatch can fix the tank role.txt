[[How do you think Overwatch can fix the tank role]]


Fixing tank seems to be a constant struggle for the Overwatch dev team. Even in OW1, tank was the most unfun role thanks to the massive focus of CC that was thrown the tanks way. In season 10 of OW2, the issue has shifted from massive amounts of CC to massive amounts of damage (and CC). Obviously, I know people are going to shout that 6v6 is the answer, but I think it's extremely unlikely to ever come back. 

So I'd prefer to discuss ways to fix the tanking problem without a full revert to OW1 style 6v6. My personal opinion is that they already had the answer to this problem when OW2 launched. The first couple Sojourn dominated seasons of the game, I don't think I saw nearly as many complaints about tanks being bad. In fact, I saw almost universal praise that the gameplay felt drastically better for all roles. Minus that of supports who were still adapting to the lack of peel, though I also believe that was just the community learning a new format rather than a balancing issue. 

So what happened?

I think to fix the role, the current tank passive needs to be removed, or more precisely expanded. A resistance to all status effects/CC across the board. Everything from Ashe's dynamite to Doom's punch to Lucio's boop to Brig's bash should simply affect tanks less. Any form of stun, anti, discord, reduced healing, slow, boop, or hinder should have a reduced affect on tanks. This idea's nothing new, but I think this alone would make the role feel much better. 

Next, scale back the CC. Again. Mei was arguably better and less frustrating without slow on her primary, hinder has never been a fun mechanic, and Sombra is far and away the most complained about hero across all roles. These lockout/CC abilities simply aren't fun and there intended design of stopping Flanders has almost never been utilized. Even back in OW1, CC was thrown at the tank. Nothing has changed, and adding CC back has made the role much worse. Relegate hard CC mostly to tanks while taking away killing potential (NOT playmaking potential) and I think the role would have a much better position. Both in that its job would be better defined and that it'd play better. 

Stealing this idea from a Twitter comment, alter the satisfying "dink" sound a player gets when they're shooting a tank. Yes it's a bit meta, but it also serves to help newer players understand that shooting a tank is inherently providing less value to the team than shooting a squishy. 



ok but that clip isn't the greatest example tbh anyone would have died walking that doorway
    Guy goes in, 1v5, uses all his mobility before getting there, choses the most obvious path to contest possible and doesn't use his defensive ability, instead opting to shoot his shotgun-type weapon in the general direction of the enemy team at mid distance. All while playing quite possibly THE worst tank against what the enemy was playing.

"Tank needs to be fixed!!1!"

Slight joking aside, I get that he attempted to get there in time to contest (which in itself was a mistake, there was no way that was gonna work), but like you said, this clip is a terrible example of the point he was trying to make.
        Why would he block firstly against Orisa tho
            He did not block first, he specifically started blocking after he recovered from the spear
                Exactly! Why tf would you block when Orisa has Javelin? It's an easy target, she just cancels your block with Jav and you're cooked.  
That's what i'm saying
        It wasn't 1v5. Kiri was right behind me and the rest of my team wasn't far off. You can see suzu go off a split second after I die.

I wasn't going to use block before jav came out.

This was just an example clip I had on hand that shows how tanks are meant to take every cooldown and draw damage but are incapable of actually surviving through that. Yes, anyone dies there. I was just trying to spark discussion about ideas to fix the tank role.
            Seems more like an example of going into spawn and pressing the ol H key
            They weren't far off, but what's most important is line of sight, your team was not set up in time so you shouldn't have gone in in retrospect (but making mistakes in the moment is understandable). 
You went in on a losing fight to begin with, its better to let them have the point and group up for a solid team fight. 

To put it bluntly. Youre going in against a full team with all of their abilities, you already used one of yours, and there is only three spots they have to look for. All of which are chokepoints. 

There is nothing for them to do except watch those areas, and they are ready to shoot anything tank or not. It may seem like you shouldn't give them the point there, but all you're going to do there is touch and die, you cant even ult because youd stop contesting during. So just back up and group up.

Just because you have 500+ hp doesn't mean you can just do whatever you want. There are times where you can, and times where you cannot. You couldve had a perfectly good fight staged after that big door opens, and maybe could have held their spawn if your team knows what theyre doing. And then youd have the plane thats up there for cover. Sometimes you have to concede that fight and prepare for the next, but always take the fight on your terms not the enemies. 

If you're blaming the tank role, then you're not taking accountability for your rash decision making. No character in the game is going through that door and living by themselves. Learn to look back to see where your team is first before engaging even in desperate times like this. Oh, im the only one that has crazy mobility enough to touch this and no one else can keep up without blowing their cooldowns? Maybe i shouldn't contest all 5 and be down all my abilities.
    Kiriko was right behind me, and the rest of my team wasn't far behind. You can even see suzu go off the second after I die. Yes, it's a risky fight to engage in, but had that suzu hit, the enemy is suddenly down a ton of CDs and my team engages with all of theirs minus suzu. Ik it'd easy to look at an 8 second clip and deduce everything about the game, but it's also not the point of this post. 

This is just an example clip I had on hand. Tank has an issue right now where their job seems to be taking every cooldown and drawing tons of fire, but they can't actually survive through doing that. Even OWCS, teams top strategy is blowing up the tank immediately. The point of the post is to spark discussion about ways to fix the tank role. If your point is that nothing is wrong with the tank role, then that's an entirely different matter altogether.
        Man you got hammered. You'd be lucky for 2 healers on you to survive that..
            If the suzu hits before I die, I 100% survive that. At least long enough to touch and survive a couple seconds before I get meteor strike. Not that my Kiri mde a mistake by suzuing late. They were healing me as I went through the door, they just probably didn't expect me to insta-die.
                Suzu lasts for 0.65 seconds. Even if you touch and go into meteor strike you just c9 and die afterwards. This is not even an overtime situation. In no world do you survive. Their orisa + zen is enough of a counter to reconsider this play. Consider pressing H
                    Suzu cleanses me of discord and let's me use block sooner. With how they were focus firing, I'd have empowered punch and since they were stacked on cart, even if Orisa fortified, I'd get a lot of overhealth from landing it. Surviving after that is just a dance around cart. Two seconds and my team is there as well and I can meteor strike without C9. 

Obviously things didn't play out like that so it doesn't matter. That was just my thought process when turning around the corner before going from 500->0 health within a second.
                        You are not "dancing around the cart" with 5 people starring you down. Doom is not that good my guy. Maybe if their team was like paper rank. You are gonna meteor strike in and orisa is gonna use her javelin spin to move you calmly off the point. Also you keep saying "but this is not what the post is really about" while continuing to try to defend it. So which is it? Is defending this clip important for the discussion or just your ego?
                            It's not what the post is about, but I logically feel a need to defend my line of thinking when it's constantly criticized in spite of me attempting to move the conversation back on topic. If my playmaking decisions in an 8 second clip are supposedly enough to debunk my entire viewpoint rather than other people giving their ideas, then of course I have to provide counter arguments when it's the only point being used to counter mine.
                                I don't personally believe this clip is what your entire viewpoint is based on but YOU defending it CONSTANTLY makes the clip seem REALLY important and CRUCIAL to understanding your viewpoint. It makes it seem like this clip IS the perfect example to your tank role critique.
You went alone against a full team that knew you were coming…..my guess is that any role will feel challenging to you
    You can literally see suzu go off a split second after I died. I wasn't alone.
        Yet, you went on a choke against a full team with a hero that does little to no damage from distance
            The idea was to get suzu'd right as spear hit, block to get emp punch, touch, and stall for the two seconds my team needed to arrive before meteor striking. Yes, it was a risky play. No it did not work out. 

It's just an example clip to spark discussion about how the tank role should be fixed. The intent behind using it wasn't for Redditors to judge my skill level through an out of context 8 second clip. I see now that the post may have been better without using the gameplay footage, which is on me. I simply wanted an example to show that tanks are seemingly meant to take cooldowns and draw damage from their team, but are incapable of doing so without dying in under a second.
                I think the intent behind the criticism (at least from my side) is that the tank role is not broken, I feel like a lot of people play overwatch without understanding it’s core mechanics and that it IS a team based game, maybe in lower elos you can fuck around a lot more, but if you don’t know how to use your role to enable the team in general, you will be stuck, some tanks are more fun to play than others, but the role is what the role is, you need to make space and peel for your team, there was absolutely no one behind you when you died, no one to capitalize on anything you did.
                    Counter argument, even in OWCS, the current meta is focus firing the tank. The team that kills the tank first wins, so it's not just a lower elo issue. (This clip took place in a high diamond lobby, which isn't very high, but isn't exactly low either.) I personally think the tank role is in a rough spot, especially with the newly added DPS passive. 

Note that I say the tank role itself. I actually think tanks right now are pretty good! When you don't immediately explode, you *can* make a play. It's just that the role feels prone to spontaneous combustion and is often dogged by constant CC. Almost any tank main out there will have a pseudo-consistent experience of being slept>hindered->hacked->hooked/jav'd->death.
                        >Almost any tank main out there will have a pseudo-consistent experience of being slept>hindered->hacked->hooked/jav'd->death.

This literally hasn't happened to me once so far this season. Sounds highly annoying for Doomfist and Ball. Nobody likes hack, but most tanks don't even notice hinder and have good counterplay against hook and jav.
                            I admittedly mostly play Doom but I can play most tanks "adequately." I think Queen is actually the one hinder annoys me most on lol. It stopping her ult is infuriating. 

I've played Doom so much that if it's just Cass or just Sonbra, it's often not an issue. Orisa rarely even feels like a counter anymore I've played against her so much. It's when the counters stack up that things get frustrating. Even more so because when the enemy goes Orisa/Cass/Sombra/Ana/Brig, it's hard for me to play *any* tank. Zarya plays okay into it but I still feel like I have to be overly passive.
                                I think counters are pretty much like that. Even the hardest counter matchup is workable if you're good on a hero. Things get bad when counters get stacked.

It makes sense that you put stock in an anti-debuff passive if you play a lot of Doom. That's Doom's big problem. I don't think it's the problem for most tanks. To give some examples: Orisa, Sigma, Dva all don't really care.

Incidentally, faced with the lineup you describe, I think Sigma would be a good pick.
                                    I actually can't stand playing Sigma against Sombra oddly enough. Her hack, I feel, shuts him down just as much as Doom/Ball since it cancels his eat, ult, and forces his shield away. Obviously I don't play anywhere near as much Sigma as Doom, and ik he's affected a lot less by the other listed heroes, but Sombra just seems like a really tough matchup for him.
                        That’s where the team part plays into, if the entire enemy is focusing the tank, that means you have 2 dps free to take down the enemy support and dps, since no one is focusing them, now if your team is also just dmg farming on the enemy tank, that’s a problem
                            But that's my exact point. If the entire enemy team focuses the tank, then the tank dies. That's why the meta in the OWCS has developed into shooting the tank. I agree that if the role functioned as intended, suffering for the sake of others would be a good play. I eat all their cooldowns and soak up damage, my DPS/supports make a play. All's well that ends well. 

The issue is that it's not really possible to soak all those abilities/damage without falling over. If you fall over in half a second, then your team doesn't benefit at all from you drawing focus. Instead, you've fed, and you're left feeling like you couldn't have done anything better. Tank has always been about getting away with as much as possible without dying. I feel like the "without dying" portion has become obscenely difficult with the addition of the DPS passive.
You literally misplayed
Remove it, just use 3 dps, 2 supps.
    It would be so much fun, they can make spawning quicker
As Yeatle put it, most tanks aren't flexible enough to outplay everything and have an impact going into every bad matchup. Some are better than others, but the issue is that they need tools that let them allow them to do that in this climate without overtly relying on their teammates. Honestly that should apply to every character in every role, but OW being OW it'll probably never happen, at least for a long time.
    Tanks rely on teammates = Tanks suck, they can't carry

Tanks don't require teammates = what is this CoD copy DM garbage, OW 2 sucks
        Well tanks that remove outplay from an enemy outside the scope of “teammate help me” are kind of awful to play against; just like how tanks who can’t outplay a bastion are awful to play.
Three is nothing we can do
They can't. The game is flawed in a way that unless theres a major shift in how its designed it can't be fixed. For starters we would require to remove the hero swap mid game to adress the rock/paper/scisors issues. Then there would be the need to lower tank damage and increase their capacity to mitigate damage to a point they can solo tank but not kill everyone at ease. Once those two are done only then the role would maybe feel fun. Take Orisa for example, shes ridiculously hard to kill because of all her damage mitigation but she got too much damage too, make tanks like that except the too much damage part and you're gold (ya know... like ever other game?)
    I'm not sure I agree with this in all honesty. As frustrating as the rock-paper-scissors can theoretically be, I feel that removing counterswapping means that you are at an immediate disadvantage out the gate that you cannot correct. You could argue they then must rework every hero so that there are no hard counters, but that's so far removed from current Overwatch that it'd take years to properly do. 

I don't actually know what they can do about counterswapping outside of removing the keep ult on swap. It can be annoying, but maybe that's the type of game they want Overwatch to be. Hero bans is an idea I see thrown around a lot but idk if that would actually help.
Oh my god I'm so tired of comments sitting there and saying "you went in alone", the fuck you didn't. You poked at the doorway as a fucking TANK to get some cheeky shots in and despite using your defensive ability you got stunned and killed in a second. If you think the issue is the player, you're missing the point.
    I'm tired of orisas that stand in the open bleeding health doing cheeky damage after they've used their cooldowns while the dps need urgent healing to get back in the fight.

Probably with tanks not taking on the entire enemy team without support healing or dps countering. In any case, fate was sealed the second you were stunned by the javelin
>Minus that of supports who were still adapting to the lack of peel, though I also believe that was just the community learning a new format rather than a balancing issue.

The current tank problem isn't a balancing issue, either. The problem is that most people do not find playing balanced tanks fun. It's a stressful role because you are getting so much focus and your team has often irrational expectations, leading to toxic comments.

From a balance perspective, tank is in just about the best place it's ever been. There are no win rate outliers. There is a wide diversity of viable tank picks.

>Sombra is far and away the most complained about hero across all roles.

Nobody likes Sombra, but the most complained about hero I see is Orisa. More generally, the community usually aggros on whatever the perceived best tank of the moment is.
Terrible example
OP getting flamed
Personally, it would just be nice to be able to kill anything with a tank ultimate. DVA everyone scatters, Winston can’t kill if there’s a mercy pocket, rein if you do manage to avoid Suzu &lamp for a 5k shatter you immediately encounter ram/bastion Ana, Orisa gets peddled, sigma gets healed through, doom is a joke, ball is luck, hog I guess but then you have to play hog. 

I wouldn’t even mind as much eating every cc if there was a balanced reward with the ult
    I hadn't actually thought of that before but it's a fair point. Most tank ults are used more for displacement or zoning than getting a kill. I had considered it just part of the role, being that their abilities are great for taking space by displacing enemies, but it's true that abilities like that can lend itself to less gratifying plays.
You gotta fix your skill issue first and then talk
Keep in mind these are the same type of people who were saying that a top 500 Reinhardt main missplayed by walking forward and dying in a quarter of a second.

The issue isn't that the tank died, the issue is that the TTK on tanks is way to quick way too often. Tanks literally don't feel tanky anymore, and its the reason no one is enjoying the role.
It seems more like  skill issues
It takes longer to kill Venture than a real tank
That was all on you, not the tank role
What if there was a second tank? 8o
2 tanks
Nah they just need to make tank a little smaller, decrease their health and give them ways to outskill cc abilities.
    Making tanks smaller isn't something I'd heard before! Interesting idea. The only thing I'd worry about is the potential of tanks not being tanks anymore. They're already quite vague on what they're designed to do, but I feel like making them smaller and reducing health might make them too akin to DPS.
        https://youtu.be/bLSep9NzN_k?si=WW_1HD9sUH-9uenQ this is an amazing video on the subject, the only constant definition of tank is something that diverges you attention on itself for longer periods of times compared to other roles
Tank is in a better place now than ever. 

It shouldn't be a dominant role.  People have developed strange opinions about how powerful each role should be.
    The real problem isn't tank being weak but unfun
They can't fix your skill. Less typing, more thinking.
Nothing will ever happen because as long as supports are happy then blizzard is happy. Once tanks get to such a bad state it starts to affect dps and supports, then something will be done. A content creator who was invited to Blizzards offices said the dev team disagrees with the tank community about the state of tanks so dont expect much to change.
Make doom dps again 🫶🏾 and buff rein
    No please! I love tank Doom.
        Also prefer tank Doom! Nothing more satisfying than those 3+ person punches.
Guy goes in, 1v5, uses all his mobility before getting there, choses the most obvious path to contest possible and doesn't use his defensive ability, instead opting to shoot his shotgun-type weapon in the general direction of the enemy team at mid distance.

                        But that's my exact point. If the entire enemy team focuses the tank, then the tank dies. That's why the meta in the OWCS has developed into shooting the tank. I agree that if the role functioned as intended, suffering for the sake of others would be a good play. I eat all their cooldowns and soak up damage, my DPS/supports make a play. All's well that ends well. 

The issue is that it's not really possible to soak all those abilities/damage without falling over. If you fall over in half a second, then your team doesn't benefit at all from you drawing focus. Instead, you've fed, and you're left feeling like you couldn't have done anything better. Tank has always been about getting away with as much as possible without dying. I feel like the "without dying" portion has become obscenely difficult with the addition of the DPS passive.
It would be so much fun, they can make spawning quicker
Tanks rely on teammates = Tanks suck, they can't carry

Tanks don't require teammates = what is this CoD copy DM garbage, OW 2 sucks
    Well tanks that remove outplay from an enemy outside the scope of “teammate help me” are kind of awful to play against; just like how tanks who can’t outplay a bastion are awful to play.
I'm not sure I agree with this in all honesty. As frustrating as the rock-paper-scissors can theoretically be, I feel that removing counterswapping means that you are at an immediate disadvantage out the gate that you cannot correct. You could argue they then must rework every hero so that there are no hard counters, but that's so far removed from current Overwatch that it'd take years to properly do. 

I don't actually know what they can do about counterswapping outside of removing the keep ult on swap. It can be annoying, but maybe that's the type of game they want Overwatch to be. Hero bans is an idea I see thrown around a lot but idk if that would actually help.
I'm tired of orisas that stand in the open bleeding health doing cheeky damage after they've used their cooldowns while the dps need urgent healing to get back in the fight. 
I hadn't actually thought of that before but it's a fair point. Most tank ults are used more for displacement or zoning than getting a kill. I had considered it just part of the role, being that their abilities are great for taking space by displacing enemies, but it's true that abilities like that can lend itself to less gratifying plays.
Making tanks smaller isn't something I'd heard before! Interesting idea. The only thing I'd worry about is the potential of tanks not being tanks anymore. They're already quite vague on what they're designed to do, but I feel like making them smaller and reducing health might make them too akin to DPS.
    https://youtu.be/bLSep9NzN_k?si=WW_1HD9sUH-9uenQ this is an amazing video on the subject, the only constant definition of tank is something that diverges you attention on itself for longer periods of times compared to other roles
The real problem isn't tank being weak but unfun
No please! I love tank Doom.
    Also prefer tank Doom! Nothing more satisfying than those 3+ person punches.
Why would he block firstly against Orisa tho
    He did not block first, he specifically started blocking after he recovered from the spear
        Exactly! Why tf would you block when Orisa has Javelin? It's an easy target, she just cancels your block with Jav and you're cooked.  
That's what i'm saying
It wasn't 1v5. Kiri was right behind me and the rest of my team wasn't far off. You can see suzu go off a split second after I die.

I wasn't going to use block before jav came out.

This was just an example clip I had on hand that shows how tanks are meant to take every cooldown and draw damage but are incapable of actually surviving through that. Yes, anyone dies there. I was just trying to spark discussion about ideas to fix the tank role.
    Seems more like an example of going into spawn and pressing the ol H key
    They weren't far off, but what's most important is line of sight, your team was not set up in time so you shouldn't have gone in in retrospect (but making mistakes in the moment is understandable). 
Man you got hammered. You'd be lucky for 2 healers on you to survive that..
    If the suzu hits before I die, I 100% survive that. At least long enough to touch and survive a couple seconds before I get meteor strike. Not that my Kiri mde a mistake by suzuing late. They were healing me as I went through the door, they just probably didn't expect me to insta-die.
        Suzu lasts for 0.65 seconds. Even if you touch and go into meteor strike you just c9 and die afterwards. This is not even an overtime situation. In no world do you survive. Their orisa + zen is enough of a counter to reconsider this play. Consider pressing H
            Suzu cleanses me of discord and let's me use block sooner. With how they were focus firing, I'd have empowered punch and since they were stacked on cart, even if Orisa fortified, I'd get a lot of overhealth from landing it. Surviving after that is just a dance around cart. Two seconds and my team is there as well and I can meteor strike without C9. 

Obviously things didn't play out like that so it doesn't matter. That was just my thought process when turning around the corner before going from 500->0 health within a second.
                You are not "dancing around the cart" with 5 people starring you down. Doom is not that good my guy. Maybe if their team was like paper rank. You are gonna meteor strike in and orisa is gonna use her javelin spin to move you calmly off the point. Also you keep saying "but this is not what the post is really about" while continuing to try to defend it. So which is it? Is defending this clip important for the discussion or just your ego?
                    It's not what the post is about, but I logically feel a need to defend my line of thinking when it's constantly criticized in spite of me attempting to move the conversation back on topic. If my playmaking decisions in an 8 second clip are supposedly enough to debunk my entire viewpoint rather than other people giving their ideas, then of course I have to provide counter arguments when it's the only point being used to counter mine.
                        I don't personally believe this clip is what your entire viewpoint is based on but YOU defending it CONSTANTLY makes the clip seem REALLY important and CRUCIAL to understanding your viewpoint. It makes it seem like this clip IS the perfect example to your tank role critique.
Yet, you went on a choke against a full team with a hero that does little to no damage from distance
    The idea was to get suzu'd right as spear hit, block to get emp punch, touch, and stall for the two seconds my team needed to arrive before meteor striking. Yes, it was a risky play. No it did not work out. 

It's just an example clip to spark discussion about how the tank role should be fixed. The intent behind using it wasn't for Redditors to judge my skill level through an out of context 8 second clip. I see now that the post may have been better without using the gameplay footage, which is on me. I simply wanted an example to show that tanks are seemingly meant to take cooldowns and draw damage from their team, but are incapable of doing so without dying in under a second.
        I think the intent behind the criticism (at least from my side) is that the tank role is not broken, I feel like a lot of people play overwatch without understanding it’s core mechanics and that it IS a team based game, maybe in lower elos you can fuck around a lot more, but if you don’t know how to use your role to enable the team in general, you will be stuck, some tanks are more fun to play than others, but the role is what the role is, you need to make space and peel for your team, there was absolutely no one behind you when you died, no one to capitalize on anything you did.
            Counter argument, even in OWCS, the current meta is focus firing the tank. The team that kills the tank first wins, so it's not just a lower elo issue. (This clip took place in a high diamond lobby, which isn't very high, but isn't exactly low either.) I personally think the tank role is in a rough spot, especially with the newly added DPS passive. 

Note that I say the tank role itself. I actually think tanks right now are pretty good! When you don't immediately explode, you *can* make a play. It's just that the role feels prone to spontaneous combustion and is often dogged by constant CC. Almost any tank main out there will have a pseudo-consistent experience of being slept>hindered->hacked->hooked/jav'd->death.
                >Almost any tank main out there will have a pseudo-consistent experience of being slept>hindered->hacked->hooked/jav'd->death.

This literally hasn't happened to me once so far this season. Sounds highly annoying for Doomfist and Ball. Nobody likes hack, but most tanks don't even notice hinder and have good counterplay against hook and jav.
                    I admittedly mostly play Doom but I can play most tanks "adequately." I think Queen is actually the one hinder annoys me most on lol. It stopping her ult is infuriating. 

I've played Doom so much that if it's just Cass or just Sonbra, it's often not an issue. Orisa rarely even feels like a counter anymore I've played against her so much. It's when the counters stack up that things get frustrating. Even more so because when the enemy goes Orisa/Cass/Sombra/Ana/Brig, it's hard for me to play *any* tank. Zarya plays okay into it but I still feel like I have to be overly passive.
                        I think counters are pretty much like that. Even the hardest counter matchup is workable if you're good on a hero. Things get bad when counters get stacked.

It makes sense that you put stock in an anti-debuff passive if you play a lot of Doom. That's Doom's big problem. I don't think it's the problem for most tanks. To give some examples: Orisa, Sigma, Dva all don't really care.

Incidentally, faced with the lineup you describe, I think Sigma would be a good pick.
                            I actually can't stand playing Sigma against Sombra oddly enough. Her hack, I feel, shuts him down just as much as Doom/Ball since it cancels his eat, ult, and forces his shield away. Obviously I don't play anywhere near as much Sigma as Doom, and ik he's affected a lot less by the other listed heroes, but Sombra just seems like a really tough matchup for him.
                That’s where the team part plays into, if the entire enemy is focusing the tank, that means you have 2 dps free to take down the enemy support and dps, since no one is focusing them, now if your team is also just dmg farming on the enemy tank, that’s a problem

        But that's my exact point. If the entire enemy team focuses the tank, then the tank dies. That's why the meta in the OWCS has developed into shooting the tank. I agree that if the role functioned as intended, suffering for the sake of others would be a good play. I eat all their cooldowns and soak up damage, my DPS/supports make a play. All's well that ends well. 

The issue is that it's not really possible to soak all those abilities/damage without falling over. If you fall over in half a second, then your team doesn't benefit at all from you drawing focus. Instead, you've fed, and you're left feeling like you couldn't have done anything better. Tank has always been about getting away with as much as possible without dying. I feel like the "without dying" portion has become obscenely difficult with the addition of the DPS passive.
You are not "dancing around the cart" with 5 people starring you down. Doom is not that good my guy. Maybe if their team was like paper rank. You are gonna meteor strike in and orisa is gonna use her javelin spin to move you calmly off the point. Also you keep saying "but this is not what the post is really about" while continuing to try to defend it. So which is it? Is defending this clip important for the discussion or just your ego?
    It's not what the post is about, but I logically feel a need to defend my line of thinking when it's constantly criticized in spite of me attempting to move the conversation back on topic. If my playmaking decisions in an 8 second clip are supposedly enough to debunk my entire viewpoint rather than other people giving their ideas, then of course I have to provide counter arguments when it's the only point being used to counter mine.
        I don't personally believe this clip is what your entire viewpoint is based on but YOU defending it CONSTANTLY makes the clip seem REALLY important and CRUCIAL to understanding your viewpoint. It makes it seem like this clip IS the perfect example to your tank role critique.
>Almost any tank main out there will have a pseudo-consistent experience of being slept>hindered->hacked->hooked/jav'd->death.

This literally hasn't happened to me once so far this season. Sounds highly annoying for Doomfist and Ball. Nobody likes hack, but most tanks don't even notice hinder and have good counterplay against hook and jav.
    I admittedly mostly play Doom but I can play most tanks "adequately." I think Queen is actually the one hinder annoys me most on lol. It stopping her ult is infuriating. 

I've played Doom so much that if it's just Cass or just Sonbra, it's often not an issue. Orisa rarely even feels like a counter anymore I've played against her so much. It's when the counters stack up that things get frustrating. Even more so because when the enemy goes Orisa/Cass/Sombra/Ana/Brig, it's hard for me to play *any* tank. Zarya plays okay into it but I still feel like I have to be overly passive.
        I think counters are pretty much like that. Even the hardest counter matchup is workable if you're good on a hero. Things get bad when counters get stacked.

It makes sense that you put stock in an anti-debuff passive if you play a lot of Doom. That's Doom's big problem. I don't think it's the problem for most tanks. To give some examples: Orisa, Sigma, Dva all don't really care.

Incidentally, faced with the lineup you describe, I think Sigma would be a good pick.
            I actually can't stand playing Sigma against Sombra oddly enough. Her hack, I feel, shuts him down just as much as Doom/Ball since it cancels his eat, ult, and forces his shield away. Obviously I don't play anywhere near as much Sigma as Doom, and ik he's affected a lot less by the other listed heroes, but Sombra just seems like a really tough matchup for him.
