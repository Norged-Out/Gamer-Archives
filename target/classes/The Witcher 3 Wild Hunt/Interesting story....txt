[[Interesting story...]]





Emhyr: You have to find Ciri.
Geralt: But how about a round of gwent?
    Okay, but no Skelli decks
        Which one of these dialogue options will result in  
~~Sex~~

**Gwent**
            Why not both?
                That‚Äôs why Shani is the best romance in the game, redhead AND sex AND Gwen.
                    Shani gf is best gf
                The Tramp Deck
        Ofc not, Northern Realms for the win.
    Emhyr: *nods silently*
And a true patriot using the Northern Realms
    ‚ÄúA patriot, and a real son of a bitch‚Äù
    Best deck imo
        spies are broken, therefore NG is broken.
            Yeah I literally only have like 6 spies, 2 decoys, 2 commanders horns, and nothing else but hero cards in my deck.  I basically ran a trimmed 22 card deck so I'd wind up using pretty much the same hand every game
            Plenty of neutral spies, also the main reason they redesign gwent multiplayer

            Uhhh best quest is definitely drinking with the boys then cross-dressing and hijacking the megascope, definitely @ me
            Triss better though
I'm so happy the Dicaprio meme has made it to Geralt lmao
    God I couldn't even tell that's what it was lmfao
Once i just replayed the witcher beacause of gwent... man i love that game.

                            I was trying to ask the bot if you were a bot. It says to do that in the small print, but I guess I needed to put your name inside the <>. I'm used to files where those arrows are supposed to be excluded.

I fixed it, let's see if it makes a difference.

        This fucking slaps
        you're the best haiku bot. don't let that other bot get you down, he's a brown noser.
    Same here but I progressed to far and I couldn't challenge the Baron for Geralt and thus couldn't compete in the gwent competition ):
        Time to restart the game, then
        If you miss it his card is on his desk in his room you can go back and get it!!!!
    You got haiku bot because you put an extra letter in "because" i bet.
Yeh man fuck ciri. It's time for witcher 3 card hunt. Spam that spacebar to skip cutscenes that isn't anyway giving me a dull nod of agreement to my Gwent match offer
    I always imagine them saying "Hmmm... I believe you are on, good sir" in a posh British accent as they do that nod
Do you remember the last time you did something else rather than contracts ? Me neither

Anyone play Gwent on Hard mode?
    No

My two favourite memes finally combined
child, shmild, how bout some Gwent?
Best usage of this meme so far!
I'm still trying to collect all the cards
I appreciate the work that went into this post
This Leonardo meme is getting out of hand üòÇüòÇüî•
    Leo meme best meme
Currently playing Witcher 3 for the first time (complete game), any tips I need to have fun? I‚Äôm trying to get good at the game, and play as many side quest as I can along the way.
    So for me it takes a while to get into the game, since I'm the beginning was tough for me. I would say you should progress quite a bit in the main story first in your first playthrough, get decent gear and just explore since everything is so rich. Take time to read the bestiary, find recipes and craft bombs to prepare for what you can and then realize all that preparing was for nothing when you encounter a new monster lol. 

But you can play the game as you see fit :) the only way to really enjoy it is when you spend enough time on it to completely lose yourself in the immersion
meanwhile, I'm here doing side quests leveling up to 20+ while the
I love this meme format. Take this platinum and be on your way.
    Thank you so much bro! Appreciate my first platinum!
I thought there was something on my phone and tried to wipe it off before I realized that‚Äôs the weirdest font I‚Äôve seen in a while
This is gold!!!!!!!!!!
I think Ciri can wait until I master all decks ** plays against BB one more time  **
    Lol if I could I'd stop the reunion with Citiri and challenge her to my scummy Spy deck
        Citiri
Geralt: I thinkith not.
Nice interpretation of me. I salute you. Toss a coin to me.
Well done sir. I played the other day and lost twice. Got all the shot cards

Lmfao quite literally me, stalling soo hard not to end my first play through üòÜüòÖ im so bad im into the mobile gwent now ahaha
Baron be like FIND MY WIFE

Ok but how bout a round of gwent


OF COURSE
I guess I must be alone in hating gwent I never could grasp it it's not fun to me it's just an annoying card game. I miss dice poker from Witcher 1 and 2.
    Yo, check out some tips online, it's super fun once you start winning gl man
Thanks so much for the award! :)
Well, even critically lowering the Drowner's population in Velen just to get exp
Fuck Gwent, all my homies hate Gwent
I'm replaying the game for the first time after the kind of disappointment that was CP (got my PC last year and finally played it on March) and I feel like such an idiot for not getting into Gwent. Is so much fun but I do see how it could have ruined the pace of the game for me haha one thing I spent like 4 just playing and getting the cards
Yeeeeep...
Everyone loves qwent so much but I honestly don't see the appeal. I'm on my first play through of the game, and other than the first ever qwent thing at the start of the game, I always run away from qwent when someone mentions it.

Probably because I'm absolutely terrible at it, I can't even manage to beat the dude that introduces you to qwent, let alone anyone else.

I'd probably like it more if I was good at it, but i have no idea how to successfully play it
    I feel you. It was only until I really started going out of my way to collect cards and strictly went into a devoy/spy deck and started absolutely destroying people in gwent that i became addicted to it. There's something so addicting with collecting cards and beating legendary gwent players, I highly recommend you collect cards through the Witcher wiki and then try to collect em all.
        My current play through, I'm not even gonna try. I buy some cards every once in a while from a merchant, but I'm not gonna try to play it at all. When I start a ng+ then I'll put in the effort to learn how to play
    I played all the way through having played and lost at Gwent exactly twice. Stupid bloody game that I couldn't immediately win!
        Yep lol, I've tried multiple times, but I can't seem to figure it out
I have to find this siege card.
Witcher 3 is a pretty good card game with some open world stuff I never got into
Who is ciri ?
Fallout New Vegas ü§ù Witcher

How to find Ciri: press button on iPhone, ‚ÄúYo Siri where you at girl?‚Äù
 And a true patriot using the Northern Realms
As it should be. Gwent is LIFE.
Okay, but no Skelli decks
