[[When you take drugs and talk to your horse about game mechanics]]





i've heard about this quest but somehow i missed it.  I've never been a completionist, but I try for every single '?' quest mark in Witcher 3.  I thought I cleared Touissant, took some screenshots with Yen lounging in the sun for closure before I started my NG+, but I still haven't bumped into this Roach quest.
    There are some quests in Witcher 3 that don't show up on the map as a "?". You just gotta stumble on them. I haven't found it either

IGN offers this "You can start this quest by talking to a Pinastri. She can be found northeast of Dun Tynne Crossroads, northwest of Basane Farm signpost, southeast of Trading Post signpost, and far east of Coronata Vineyard."
        Awesome thanks!  Maybe there are even more quests I haven't done yet!
            I know for a fact I've definitely missed this quest and the one where the vampire asks it its 1372 yet (or something like that).
My favorite mission by far in the game. Laughed the whole time. It's just back and forth between you and roach for the whole mission.
