[[Just started Witcher Wild Hunt, any tips]]


I bought the complete edition a while ago and just did not have the drive to play it til recently.


Go slow. Immerse yourself into the world. Take in every part of the story. You’ll be sad when it’s over
    Do ALL the side quests. Most, if not all of the side quests are just as compelling, rich, and worthy of your time as the main quest. Also, don't forget a round of gwent.
        When it comes to Gwent, battle every merchant and side quest Gwent mini boss without remorse
            No, skip every gwent encounter because it’s garbage and the worst mini game ever.
                Congratulations, you managed to have an opinion that is objectively false.
                    Wrong
                        No sir, you… you are the one that is wrong
                        Lol. At least you tried.
                        lil bro can’t think two steps ahead what a moron
                I enjoy card games personally, but hey u dont or at least didn't like Gwent and that's ok
                Most people love Gwent. Your opinion only include the minority here.
                I HATE Gwent, but the completionist in me is screaming to do it anyway... please help me for the love of god
                    My first playthrough I skipped it, but this time the completionist in me got to me too, you get used to Gwent and after awhile it's not that bad
                        It's not bad at all, in fact it's really well thought out, really fun, engaging, and full of lore and tons of great artwork.
                            The more I play it the more I like it.
                                The more you play the better cards you get so when you draw that Cirilla Card, you know you’re gonna wipe the floor with that merchant.
                                    I've progressed a good bit so far, have maybe half the cards, the Ciri card I have. I've come to not mind the game and I'm liking it more, but it doesn't change the fact I picked up a controller and not a deck of cards for a specific reason, that reason being I don't like playing card games. Gwent is more like a CCG than a regular card game too which makes it even more annoying. I'm doing it for completion only, I won't be playing in subsequent playthroughs. I'm just happy I seem to be developing a tolerance.
                    How can you hate it?
                    My auto win gwent mod go brrr
                Once I got into Gwent I became obsessed. I think I skipped it entirely for the first 4 times I played the game thru.
        I would suggest this but with a side note. You don't have to do all the side quests at the time you get them. Especially if you feel overwhelmed. You can leave most of the side quests for after the main story's ending when you will probably want to have more witcher content.
        Along with this point about doing all quests: Watch the quest ‘Recommended levels’. Try to complete them while you’re still around the same level as the quest because if you over level too much, the XP rewards drop drastically. If over by like 5 levels, on some quests you might literally get only 1 XP.

Don’t worry about grinding for XP because a majority of your XP comes from completing the quests themselves(and Axii dialogue challenges, so max Delusion ASAP). The only time you should spend any time grinding is when you’re looking for specific monster parts.
    Couldn't agree more. I rushed the story and skipped cutscenes every time and when I got Ciri I was like 'how'd she get here?'. Now I'm doing a second playthrough after 3 years doing every side quest and exhausting dialogue options. 

Take your time OP, don't rush things and immerse yourself. Post game depression is real.
        Never understood how people can play story games and skip all the cutscenes on the first playthrough
            ADHD hits me hard brother 😂
            Tbf, I skipped some cutscenes on some second quests, till I figured that those second quests were influencing the main ones. I'm planning to run it all again in NG+ and not skip one single second of conversation.
            I always always skipped cutscenes in games *until* I played this game.  Every single one is so immersive it would be a disservice to the game (and to yourself) not to watch them.
            Metal Gear Solid as a child and I only had 1 hour of playtime per day. 

I couldn't be watching all the cutscenes if I wanted to hide in a cardboard box and stay out of those viewcones.
            Well to be honest, I just got my new pc that time and I barely had enough time to play (just about one hour of gameplay per day) so I decided to skip through most of the scenes. 

It was when Geralt finally met Ciri and I didn't understand what happened because I skipped the scenes. I was confused about why she was suddenly there. I regretted that and now I always exhaust dialogue options and never skip cutscenes. I've learned my lesson.
        Just curious, as I have never done that in a game. Why rush and skip dialogue and cutscenes? Honestly just curious, no hate.
            Simple because people are impatient. It’s so annoying seeing people complain about games being “too hard” because they didn’t pay attention to cutscenes or dialogue.
    When you give the sword at the bar. the feels are 2 strong
        Did that last night and that feeling never goes away no matter how many times you see it.
    Even when it seems that you don't have time to do something, there are very few situations in which you don't have all the time in the world.
Only if you are told directly that you have until midnight of the same day for example is there an actual timer running, or just a marker at midnight. You can count all the times this happens in TW3, HoS, and B&W on one hand.
Even if you have a follower, they will always wait for you .here's a minor spoiler as an example, >! right at the very start of the game, at the end of the Yennefer cut-scene, you see the magic-crow fizzle out and the crystal skull fall to the ground, after your dream sequence—and the ghouls, ofc—you are practically right there where the Yennefer scene ended and the skull dropped to the ground. Get it? The skull? The ground? It's right there a few steps away for crying out loud! Use your witcher-senses and look for it, even though Vesemir might prod you to go, take your time and find it.!<
That's one of the first lessons you learn about the game, without it telling you, but you have to try it to learn it, which is probably actually the first lesson—look, just go do everything and you'll be good.
And have fun!
    You say all. No need more words
    Stole the words right out of my mouth. Inspect every little detail. EVERY LITTLE DETAIL.
I have a few tips, but some of them will only be useful later in the game

- Holding the block button will make your stamina recover slowly, so sometimes is better to learn how to dodge than simply block everything 

- Try to roll less and dodge more against smaller enemies, rolling costs stamina and places Geralt far from the enemy for a follow up attack 

- Roach is immortal 

- Roach can outrun basically any monster 

- Don’t let Roach get scared or she’ll drop you on the floor 

- If you’re on the edge of the map you can go to go to the limits of the border to fast travel

- You don’t have to aim with the crossbow, just point Geralt towards the enemy and press the shoot button 

- You can always use the crossbow underwater 

- There’s a potion that resets all your attribute points, so don’t be afraid to mess up with the skills you choose 

- Yellow dialogues can’t be replayed 

- White dialogues can unlock new information and other possibilities 

- You only need to create potions and bombs once, after they’re empty you need to meditate do refill them (and they will only consume alcohol from your inventory) 

- Broken items have worse status, but they won’t be destroyed if they reach 0% durability 

-  Holding the jump button will make you grab on a nearby border (if there’s any nearby) 

-  When falling, press the jump button before landing to roll and take less damage 

-  Red enemy health bar means you must use the steel sword, and white enemy health bar means you must use silver sword 

-  The enemy health bar will flash when it’s the right moment to press the parry button and counterattack 

-  Blacksmiths will pay better for your weapons 

- Armorers will pay better for your armor 

- Merchants with less coin in their shop will pay less for your items 

- Put the baby in the oven
    last one is so real
    Skip all these and emphasize the last one. Literally the most important plot point in W3
    I didn't know I could use the crossbow underwater until like halfway through the game.....biggest eye opener for me.
        What did you use underwater before this?
            I just...didn't go in the water cuz I kept dying to the drowners
    Today I learned!
The health bar tips were new to me and I’ve played the game three times by now. Have my upvote
    Wait is Roach female?
    You can cast a sign to calm the horse
    Damn, this was good. The ending was great!
When faced with the situation to put a baby in the oven put it in the oven.
    Hmmmm I'm one of those ppl who do like to c the bad and good ending, so I'll keep my save rdy
    Out of context this sounds hilariously fucked up
    IT ACTUALLY GIVES YOU THE GOOD ENDING TO THE QUEST OKAY?!😭
        Yes it does.

Witcher 3 is an example of good writing and execution overall. If you follow the dialogues carefully and look for what the character stands for then automatically you will go for the best outcome without trial and error of selecting different dialogues.
    I just commented the same thing as it is now a canon event for me to comment this when someone says theyre just starting out 😂😂
        Putting the baby in the oven is a cannon event
Dont Tell Yen about Triss
    Or triss about yen
        Or the Baby about the Oven
            You should absolutely tell the baby about the oven
                I will never forgive you that Freezer
            or the oven about triss
    I like where this is going
Do all the Witcher armor scavenger hunts as you level don’t save them. You’ll look way cooler.
    came to comment the same
    They are also incrediable fun
Quen. Abuse it.
    Abuse *everything*.

Seriously, I can't stress that enough.  The game gives you so many tools available.  Signs.  Mutagens.  Tailored gear sets.  Potions.  Specific builds.

Underutilizing any of it is detrimental unless you're playing on story mode.  Which really, is kind of cheap in this game.  You can just breeze through it without using much besides Igni.

Play on Sword and Story.  Or even Blood and Broken bones.  This is the way.  It will slow the game down just enough to properly enjoy it and utilize everything available to you to make it work.  Tailor it all.  It's so much more rewarding and fun.

That being said, stay the hell away from Death March until you have a couple playthroughs under your belt.  That shit is just punishment, lol.
        Died five times in the very first fight on DM 🤣
            Was losing my mind trying to beat 3 wolves.. but It gets way easier after level 8-10 just stick to it and abuse quen.. DM isn't really that hard and feels much better later in the game
                Started first play through on DM and it was brutal. Never beat it but didn't stick with it
        Death march is brutal in White Orchard. It gets a lot easier atleast as you get potions, oils a better gear.

When you get to the upper 20s of levels. It becomes a breeze. Only hard part is when it's a lot of wolves or smaller monsters. I take more damage in the fights than I do with one on one boss fights.

Now busy with act 2. Last trophy I need is to beat on DM
    Yrden > Quen for me (all opinion)

Don’t need the shield if they’re too slow to hit me
        Eh. True. Counter point though, does Yrden give you health?
            No… :(

but when I upgrade it, it goes buzz buzz at people
                Lmao
            It rebuilds your stamina faster when you are in the Yrden trap, but I can’t recall at what point I unlocked that ability. 

My order for most fights = Yrden alternate; Yrden; Queen; Aard; Aard; Aard; Aard; Aard; Aard. 

I also have the cool ability((again)don’t know when I unlocked it) to deal extra damage to opponents with Aard while they’re in the Yrden trap.
        Bruh, aard is top notch. Yrden is only helpful for some monsters.
            I guess i have a very dodge/counter strike style — so it accents how I play the best.

Aard for those enemies that need interrupting more than slowing (or anything with wings!)
                Honestly as I was typing it, I knew I was being too extreme. They're all helpful for different scenarios.
            It took me way too long to realize that you can use Aard and Axii to slow down and one shot kill some opponents
    I would advise not to abuse it actually. For me personally, the game got way too boring when I got the alternate Quen, it’s just too broken, makes the game super easy even playing on Death March. My next play through I didn’t get it and also tried not to use regular Quen as much. Had a lot more fun cause I had to rely more on other mechanics that were otherwise unnecessary in the first playthrough.
    quen is overrated. it's all about igni and aard (with freeze upgrades)
    Quen is so overpowered, especially if you level all the steps in the skill tree. Almost puts the game on easy mode.
LOOT EVERYTHING
    Had to scroll for too long to find this.
    I learned to always do that since Fable 1.
    YES!!  Like a goddamn bandit.  LOOT IT ALLLLLLL!!!!
    Skellige Smuggler Caches :(
Check armorers an and blacksmiths shop inventory, they can sell maps leading to very useful gear.

In menu you can read about monsters and characters. It contain a lot of interesting information.
go ahead and buy the books now so you have something to do when the post game depression hits
    Just finished the lady of the lake. Great books!
        If you haven't read Season of Storms, now is the perfect time. It takes place earlier in the story but is meant to be read last.
            i loved season of storms, it was a great way to end the series for me. felt like a breath of fresh air to just enjoy an adventure witchering with geralt and dandelion.
You will come across a lot of swords and equipment. Sell what you don’t need early. This will eliminate my problem early on of not having enough money to repair equipment or buy alchemy.

Also, invest in Delusion skill. Really prevents the hassle of certain dialogue. Plus it’s really cool to have characters do what you want to do.
    Along these lines, sell to the correct vendor. An armorer will pay more for armor than a weapons vendor.
    Honestly the delusion skill is kind of a waste of a skillslot as using axii is often the most boring option out of all the dialogue options.

That being said it can be pretty cool at the start, and in some cases does make it easier, for example saving you some coin or stuff like that.
        I can see where you're coming from. I didn't really take the delusion skill seriously until I got to Novigrad. But even Geralt expresses his distaste for using Axii in dialogue with Lambert. I just liked being able to take that route especially when I'm short on playtime and want to progress in a quest.
    Also, if you like a particular set visually even though you don't need it, keep it in the stash, don't sell everything... Won't say why but you'll see why it might be useful to keep some
Put the baby in the oven!
    That's just common sense.
    Does this really give the good ending? You'd think removing the curse would be better
Don't kill any NPC's that don't attack you first.
    Good advice for any FromSoft game too lol.
Don’t be afraid to start Gwent .. you will enjoy it and Ciri can wait.
    She's a strong independent woman who can handle herself, right?
        She's >! Unconscious !< for most of the game anyway, she's not going anywhere.
Some handy game mechanics: 

- loot everything: You can still ride horses as fast as always when overweight. Ride to a fast travel post

- Boats can fast travel from anywhere to discovered harbors. You can discover harbors yourself or buy maps.

- if you cross the border of the map the fast travel menu will open and you can travel to anywhere. Normally you need to get to a fast travel post to do that

- you might take a lot of fall damage very easily. You must roll/dodge before impact to receive no damage. Many people don’t know that for some reason.

- install all downloaded stuff in the main menu. before beginning 

- the „gourmet“ perk is a great help. A bit less since the Update but still great.

- loot destroyed monster nests. Good stuff in there.

- buy every gwent card you can find

- play every gwent possibility always to earn new cards.

- THE CROSSBOW INSTANT KILLS UNDERWATER 

- there are some timed dialogue options that will define the end of quest lines and the main game where you have to decide quickly. Pause button is disabled, however:
Pressing the Playstation share button or home button or where you open the screenshot menu will pause it. Don’t know the xbox version.

- the crossbow saves you on boats from nasty sirens and drowners. There is also a horn to blow you might come across that helps you.

- You can close portals with dimerithium and yrden

- there are several smaller romantic encounters you can pursue without consequence. But you have two main love interests. Dating either or both has a big influence on the story.

- read the beastiary. It will help finding monster‘s weaknesses 

- some side quests might get locked after certain main quest events. It is smart to do side quests around a region before progressing further in the main story.

- put the baby in the oven when the time comes.


Also have fun. It’s a great game
    Re the second point, I did not know that in my first playthrough, and I did every ? In Skellige
        Especially useful when on your Skellige ?-Tour and your boat is about to fall apart. You do not want to swim half an hour
    the beastiary really helped me in the fight against a shaelmaar in a tourney. the aard sign to the wall is sick
Collect all gwent cards and play gwent vs everyone cause that will be everything you ever wanted (no joke).
    Yep its like the rest are all side quest haha collect them all!!
If you see a red skull on an enemy you get a great reward after
    some people want to watch the world burn
Just play the game
Don't be impatient, don't rush through the main quest only to get to the finish line. Finish line is not the point of this game, it's about immersion, daily life, life of this one witcher. Yes, there's a bigger story but it waits for you, don't feel in a hurry. And do all the quests and contracts in accordance to your level, this way you'll not miss anything and it'll make more sense and be more fun. Stop at the merchants, play gwent, go to a barber, select armor carefully, just enjoy everything it has to offer, wander around. Read notes, books. Try to take this game as a slow paced life. I think it's quite a chill game, it's like a safe haven to me.
plunder villagers homes and sell their stuff to them for profit
Level up Quen the most! over power it, will literally save you, Aard and Yrden aswell. And some combat, for required abilities on character fast attack and strong attack,
There is a perk that lets you regenerate health after eating for twelve minutes. This will be your lifesaver.
    I had no clue that existed for like 10 hours into the game and was scavenging food everywhere.
    It has been nerfed a bit with the upgraded version, sadly. Still useful but not as much.
        How was it nerfed?
            Gives less regen per second. But it also lasts longer now.
It helps when playing DM, because there is not really passive regen and meditation doesn't full your health bar. but eventually you get good at dodging/Quen and don't really lose much health. Good perk in early game. Not so good late game.
The winds will howl from time to time. Do not be alarmed.
    Wind's howling..
Play gwent and realize that your choices in quests can lead to some pretty brutal consequences.
Don't play the 2nd DLC for 5 years, so you always have something awesome to look forward to.
Theres a lot to do, dont rush.

Explore out white orchard. Do the question marks, the quests, talk to some black smiths for maps for witcher gear. Its good gear, basically BIS for the entire game (almost). It varies in its buffs depending on what sxhool of gear you have. So its perfectly okay to use non witcher school gear.

Anyways, loot a bunch of things, in fact loot all the things. Oh and if you get the option, play some Gwent! Its great!

Great now just run around talk to people, do quests kill stuff, find stuff, save stuff, and make sure you use your potions and oils and bombs for buffs and advantages.

Now that youve got this down and youve finished white orchard, you have now completed the tutorial.

From here on out you have got 2 more IMMENSE, truly massive maps to work your way through. A hell of a lot of contracts (mutagens and trophies and gold and LORE yay!!), even more side quests (ranging from sad to wtf to funny), an amazing main story (really just stellar writing and composition), and many many many many things to loot and find.

Things to do when youre not doing the above listed stuff? Go play some gwent! Get all the cards and play everyone you meet (and by that i mean innkeepers, merchants, notable npcs). Gwent didnt strike your fancy (how could you?!), try and find all the witcher gear (there a few schools that all multiple levels of diagrams to find and craft for higher tier gear in each school ranging from basic to grandmaster tier gear), maybe go do the questions marks! Take a boat out and find underwater loot!

Great now go back to the main story and side quests! Dont forget the contracts! 

Finish the main quest. Cry (or not depending in your ending). Now go do the DLCs (preferably AFTER main quest line) one of them (Hearts of Stone) is in located in the NE corner (a large corner at that) of one of the OG maps! Its a great story! Lots of new mechanics to learn (runemaster dude, enchants, more gwent cards!). Its decently long, many hours. 

Now second DLC! EVEN bigger! Many more hours!! New mechanics again (mutations! And MORE gwent cards!!), New witcher gear!, a WHOLE new map! Very fun, very bright, very fairy tale like! Perfect palette cleanser after a rather serious 100 or so hours! (For example my third playthrough is hitting 55 hours and im only at the tail end of the main quests with soooo many more base game things left to do!)

Beat the DLC. Relax.

Great!  New game plus time! Time to do it all over again, but maybe thus time you wanna go towards a sign build! An alchemy build! Or stick to swords! 

Do all that again in NG+ and then maybe play it on Death March, or maybe go play some cyberpunk 2077! Another very very good game.

Have fun :)
Choices matter in this game. From small to big. Don’t look up the “best choices,” or anything like that. If you do, you’re ruining the magic of the game. And you’re also ruining potential replayability. Just go with your gut. 

Enjoy your time, you’re in for one of the best RPGs ever made. And I’ve played a LOT of RPGs
    I always stick with what I decided unless it is just to c the other side of my decisions
        Dont even do that. Dont reload, just play it
        Some of those choices are not immediately obvious. You’re a father figure to Ciri, and your dialogue choices have long term consequences.
Turn on auto blade oil in the settings
Go with your feelings on the choices. Most will have the same outcome regardless of what you choose. Leave the choices you didn't make for a later return playthrough.
Spam quen, you wont regret it
plunder villagers homes and sell their stuff to them for profit
    I like u and another guy making this out like a planned ambush disguised as a drug deal
You can fast travel using a boat.
Don’t kill cows.
Embrace Gwent.
Dismantle/Sell junk.
Don’t skip dialogs with Regis.
Don't play the 2nd DLC for 5 years, so you always have something awesome to look forward to.
ignore what people are saying about which choice is the best, if you want to kill a baby in a oven do that, if not dont.
Have fun its a great game!
When the time of the white frost comes, do not eat the yellow snow…
Okay here's some advice that's relevant for one particular moment and should be ignored 99% of the rest of the time

Do not accept the money.
    From who?
        Spoilers
            I already finished the game. Tell me.
            who?
    Yep yep yep.
        from who?
            Emhyr. 

ETA since this is an old thread what I mean fully is that, do not take Ciri to Emhyr. Ever. Take the choice she gives you of going straight after the crones.
First, do everything in a region(even the starting region of White Orchard) before moving on. From undiscovered locations(even Skellige, especially first playthrough), reading notice boards and riding roach on roads and paths to encounter sudden-timed quests. It'll help especially when you move to the 2nd DLC, which is Toussaint, where Grandmaster Gear is so damn expensive. It'll also give you an edge when you do your 2nd playthrough(I know you will, its just a matter of when).

Then do mods, just don't overdo it. Pick the mods the helps in fluidity of the game's system and improves the overall immersion from graphics, UIs and etc etc.

Lastly, get lost in it. You will never regret pumping a hundred or more hours into this game.

P.S. Gwent
    I have a tendency in games, it is never planned I just get off track a lot, irl too, to get lost in the middle of doing quests, if some random npc calls me on the road or a town.
I recommend turning the scaling on so loot/combat is more rewarding in gear and xp, also makes helps you make more use of potions and oils, bombs, etc
    This is great advice until you start hearts of stone too late and level 40 frog prince dances on you for hours 😭

Edit: meant to say late
        …but it scales?
            I know, if your level is any higher that the recommended 32 it scales up and becomes much harder 😭 I fought him on level 40
                I haven’t read anything about down scaling! Interesting
                    Yeah no it doesn’t scale down I don’t think
Take your time and soak it all in. It’s an amazing game with a great story and awesome character. And true open world. Explore explore explore. Tons of things to find. You’ll easily spend over 100 hours on a play through and that’s without even factoring in the DLCs. It’s not a slog however. You’ll love every minute of it. On your first play though wait to do Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine until after you finish the main story. On subsequent playthroughs including your first new game plus do the main missions, side missions and DLC missions however you like. Especially in the case of Blood and Wine there are massive plot spoilers so you won’t want to play it before seeing the ending. Speaking of which there are 3 main endings, but dozens of variations of world state. There is endless replay-ability with this game. Enjoy!
Go to settings and click on "Alternate Movement".
Everything Cultural-Strategy609 said, but also loot every herb you see in the world, crafting and alchemy ingredient possible, as they weigh nothing and will help create powerful oils, decoctions, weapons, and armors.
Quen. Always quen.
Tell your loved ones from now why you’ll have seemingly disappeared from their lives indefinitely
    Can't do that for personal reasons
First and foremost, change the map filter to show “all”. It used to be default until the remaster update. I’ve seen a few posts lately where people in the early game can’t level up fast enough for the early game and I think it’s because they didn’t do all the ? Icons on the whit orchard map bc the map wasn’t showing them. Also, Sell your swords to blacksmiths and your armor to armorers. Don’t buy any armor, weapons or blueprints bc you’ll always find better ones while looting you’ll need that money for the Witcher armor sets and especially for the dlcs. That being said, but the items with the ! Because that leads quests where you find Witcher armor blueprints. Better yet, save all your loot in your stash (green chest icon) until later in the game when you can sell them to better merchants who give you better prices and have more money to give you. Also, change movement style to alternative.
    Ayo thanks 😂 That's why the question mark wasnt showing up on unexplored areas like the previous version thank you really.
Because i do remember doing multiple places of power and found only one thst too due to mission. I just completed White orchid Nd moved on to the palace
Romance both yen and triss, you'll get the best ending I assure you
    You forgot Ciri 🤨

Don't forget you can call roach where ever you are
Put the baby in the oven, no questions
Be patient with roach. He's a bit special.

Research monsters in the bestiary. You'll know which signs, equipment and oils etc. are best to use against them.
Don’t kill the cows in the first town
Put the baby in the oven
Quen is your friend.
Fuck dem kids
Put baby in oven
Do everything. Explore every square inch. Do all the quests. Play gwent. Once you learn it, you'll love it. Fully immerse yourself and enjoy the best game ever made.

Put the baby in the oven.
No rush. Enjoy!
Put the baby in the oven
Just play the game...
Prepare for glory!
I’m about to start this myself. Your post couldn’t come at a better time!
    Same here
    Me three.  I've had this game fore years and finally have some time to play it!
Always skip Gwent, never invest in Alchemy and don’t bother with the DLC 👍 Oh and I forgot to add, always choose Triss
don't look for too many tips.  just enjoy
Depending on if you have the blood and wine dlc and your views about ciri's fate, without spoiling anything, romance both Yennefer and Triss. I can honestly say it turns out well in the end.
    You....people like you...you just want to watch the world burn
        It turns out well in the end if you get the ending i think ciri would have for herself. I stand by what i said 😂
        Or you get dandelion. Then its maybe not so good but hey, free music 😂😂
You can easily farm gold by killing cows over and over early in the game.
Throw the baby in the oven
by God, don't loot all the swords. only if you find something special or very rare, but they're not worth their inventory space
Combat + Alchemy build is easy mode. Wanna be a pussy or nah?
Cherish it.
    What I would NOT GIVE to be able to play again for the first time!!!
Dont use the ign guides for anything in this game. Whoever made them is utter dog shit at making guides.
There’s no right answer for any decision you make. Let your first playthrough be fully organic
Also make sure to play as much Gwent as you can and play the main quest at least untill you finished the quest with Keira.

After that, there are no level limitations anymore, when you aquire the eye.
Do as much as you can in the first area
**If you are not robbing peasants, you are doing it wrong!**
    I'm doing it wrong, just can't bring myself to rob the peasants 🥲 I always feel sorry for them..
        Do not feel sorry, they have no needs for trinkets of such value! Use it to fuel a higher purpose! "Why would you let some nice things rot away in a peasant hut?"
Say I love you to only one of the girls to romance her.
Pay attention to the tutorial hints.   It may seem tedious, but they're worth it
Make your choices and keep going. Some choices you may love and others you might regret but just keep going and don’t reload.
Don't ride your horse into deep water.
Romance all the women in the story.
I'm level 22 and I'm only in Skellidge. (Is that spelled right?)
Loot everything. You'll have stacks of things to sell. Mostly junk, but it adds up.
Throw the baby into the oven
Do side quests and get good armour until you can take on the next parts of the main quest. The main quests give enough decent resources for levels and give wayyy more xp, while side quests give less xp but normally better rewards.
Put the child in the oven
No
Hoard items and sell them. Doesn't matter how much money you have. You'll spend it all on cool gear when you start the DLC. Saves you a lot of grinding if you work ahead.
Fuck everyone.
do all the side questtsss
Dont rush, but, also follow along the story
    A lesson learned from replaying MGS 2. Skipped every cutscene and missed the whole plot
        Everything is in the place because of some reason, everything was designed and developed piece by piece meaning anything useless would never have made it to the final game so, trust the developers and enjoy the game in slow pace but also commit to storyline.
Gwent.
Don't sell your swords until you have knew ones
Go into that open world without tips, it’s an adventure and the journey is the destination. Soak it in. Have played 4 times still doesn’t get old.
Enjoy finish it at least 3-5 times in your lifetime
Kill as many cows as you can, repeatedly.
Dont be addicted to looting. Its exhausting and mostly unnecessary.
If you’re by the edge of the map and don’t want to walk to a fast travel post, just keep going and it’ll force you to fast travel
Don’t skip quests because if you over level yourself then you’ll only get 1XP for completing so always try to be super super thorough (talk to everyone , read notice boards) and then do quests within 5 levels of the level suggestion to maximize the reward and relative value.

Most of all, though, is because you don’t want to miss anything  because this game is so fcking amazing.
take advantage of blade oils! enemies go down much easier, if you use them well and keep upgrading them. plan ahead of big fights, but i’m fairly sure you can also reapply during a fight?
Dodge a lot
If you're selling bandit weapon junk don't make you're master blacksmith or armorer go broke you want to be able to sell them the good shit. You can sell random merchants and inns crap until they have no money. Be sure to have a look at there wares they can have some useful stuff. Maps, runes, and semi rare materials for getting weapons and armor crafted.
Throw the baby in the oven!! trust me but seriously go slow enjoy it don’t rush into the main story level up your gonna love it
Enjoy it. Don't rush, imagine yourself as Geralt and what he would do. Become Him.
Be careful who you fuck
Put the baby in the oven
Enjoy it.
Put the baby in the oven.
Romance both Yen and Triss, you'll get a cool cutscene.
you are IN LUCK my friend, you're experiencing a beautiful thing for the first time. Do everything, take your time, go slow and enjoy every little bit of it.
Enjoy the ride man, this is one of the grandest open world experiences that any game can offer.
1.) Take advantage of the bestiary. There are many different monsters and variations that you'll be coming across in the wonderful and terrifying world that is the Witcher. Each monster has a weakness that you can exploit to defeat it.

2.) Loot everything. Some items that you pick up can be dismantled for crafting. it'll require a shopkeeper of course so be sure to keep plenty of money. One thing you should definitely keep in mind when it comes to loot, if you find jewelry or gemstones, keep them! Trust me, you'll thank me later.

3.) Pace yourself. Don't worry about running out of time to do everything in the Witcher. There's plenty of time to do everything. Go explore ruins, visit some markets, hunt monsters, or even take in the amazing scenery.

4.) If you're ever in a tough battle, do not be afraid to run away and come back later to fight again once you're at a higher level. You'll know if an enemy is higher than you when it has a red skull(s) above it.

5.) Explore to your hearts content, but always remember to be cautious. You'll never know what may be lurking within or around some ruins or that cave. So if you want to be on the safe side, save your game before entering.

6.) Need a bit of extra pocket change for one of those top notch swords? Here's a few tips: do some quests on the notice boards. Npcs are are offering to pay for the services of a Witcher. Or if you just have loads of extra weapons and armor that you got from killing enemies or from exploring, sell them. Just remember this, sell weapons to the blacksmith and armor to the armorsmith.

7.) You've probably already seen this posted many times on the thread: Do not hesitate to put the baby in the oven! Not even for a second! Just do it! Lives depend on it! No pressure.

8.) Now this is the most important tip that I can give to any new player that comes into playing the Witcher. It is my gift of knowledge that I shall pass unto you my fellow Witcher. A knowledge so grand, so undeniably true to many who shall happen read this wisdom of the ancients that had pondered for many ages discovering this secret of forgotten lore. There will be many naysayers who will deny this truth. But I say, let them deny it, for they cannot handle the truth!  And that my fellow Witcher is... 

>!Have fun (Also Yen is best girl)!<
Loot everything. Pick herbs. Make Samum bombs early. Craft the Viper swords in White Orchard. Play Gwent early and often. Above all, go slow and enjoy it. This game is a masterpiece and you only get one first playthrough.
Honestly, exit this sub and enjoy your first playthrough. Only in desperate need you can really ask for help here. Just my 2 cents as I really hate any type of spoiler in my first playthrough but you do you
Use bombs.
Simulate a good itched 2 save if you want to be able to meet letho, otherwise you will be disappointed…
Put the baby in the oven. Sleep with everyone, just keep your lips zipped!
When you get to Skellige you can get back your $ from a dead guy on the beach
Babies belong in the oven
1. I Saw your other posts. I hope you are getting better, please do not kill yourself.
2. Put the baby in the oven
    I'm not getting better only worse. But I can't say anything in other subs cuz I get banned for a week again
After getting your fill of advice from this thread, anytime you see posts about this game regardless of medium, don’t look. I’d give a lot to experience this game for the first time free of spoilers just one more time.
Just spam dodge and quick attack. All you need to beat the game. Ignore any other “advanced combat tips” this is all you need.
git bread
Don’t skip dialogue, ever.

Even the small side quests have amazing narratives.
Do a playthrough naturally without looking up how to get the best ending or how to end up with which girl. This will be extremely entertaining because it will all be so new to you.

Then, when you realize you screwed everything up the first play through, play through a second time on blood and broken bones. This time, do all your research and work on getting your favorite ending. 

Then, the third time, crank up the difficulty to deathmarch and go for the opposite chick with the best Ciri ending. 

This will give you the most bang for the buck.
Good luck and have fun. This game is a banger !!!
Don’t waste money on food lol. Just kill farm animals
My favorite skill early on is Gourmet. It heals you for 20 minutes anytime you eat anything. Very good for healing throughout a cave full of monsters or an area with a ton of bandits but doesn't cost you 300 loaves of bread.
    Also I recommend doing every side quest. My first play through I streamlined the main story and was mad at myself for doing so afterward.
When the white frost comes, don’t eat the yellow snow.
Get good at fistfights.
Take your time and go SLOW! Even through the very first area. There is so much to find, and it's easy to miss things. 

Explore! Just walk in random directions off the paths. Thank us later fortelling you to go slow.
Only play gwent
It sat in my library two years. Picked it up and 4 or 5 play through later, 500 hours. It’s worth. Playing with different builds in death march and ng+. Have fun friendo
As a hardcore Quen abuser for the first couple playthroughs, other Signs are equally as good. Sword combat can get boring. Use a mix of your favorite Signs. Yrden is slept on, but late game after you can enchant your sword/armor Yrden becomes immensely powerful. Also, Igni is the shit, but most people figure that out early.
Gwent
Gwen’s is life…. Ignore everything else for Gwent
Fancy a game of Gwent?
Go for the Griffin school gear. It makes you a monster with signs.
Take it slow and do every part of white orchard. It’ll help you learn the game.
Turn off the minimap and subtitles. I found I appreciated everything way more after I did this.
Fight the Novigrad’s gards
Try to make the Missions according to Geralt's level, including the secondaries and the Witcher Hunts. This also works for treasure hunts
Right now I have 120 hours and still haven’t beaten the blood and wine dlc and still have a lot of activities to do in both dlc and main game. Don’t rush because there are quests that you can miss by certain points in the game and become unavailable.
Gwent is the best way to get the full experience and story. Play lots of games
Seduce both triss and yen for hot three-way
Did anyone write to put the baby in the oven? Yes? Ok, great then, put the damn baby in the damn oven!

Other than that people wrote a lot of good stuff in here, enjoy this masterpiece, it will be a real experience. <3
Don't rush to places you shouldn't be in just to die, do the side quests if you aren't high enough level. And don't skip any cutscenes they most always hold key information to quests and understanding the story. Oh and just enjoy the game your way.
Prepare yourself when looting a certain archipelago. It will test your sanity
Take your time. Explore every inch of that world. Appreciate everything.
Gwen
When you get to skellige hit the first merchant you come across and buy all the maps, they’ll give you all the locations around the island. It’s very important you get a boat and hit every question mark and location or you’ll miss important key information to finish the story.
Don’t skip cutscenes, try to read books to understand the lore and story a little more and once you reach lvl 30 finish the DLC stories before going to Skellige
take your time getting to know the inventory. its ok to not undetstand 90 percent of it at first. it will come as you progress through missions.
Dodge instead of rolling, actually take your time with the game, play on deathmarch difficulty, prep for fights
Loot. Everything. Sell the loot. If you grabbed swords or armour make sure they're really good. Like, really good. If they're not good then sell them
I am a firm believer that signs are the best focus class you can choose
Use everything the Witcher has, that’s potions, oils, bombs, swords, signs. That way you’ll find some stuff is strong and good for certain situations, while also experiencing all the combat has to offer. Also, use dodge rather then roll to save stamina.
Take your time, first time blind experience is the best. Make sure to use Potions and Oils before a battle. Study the Monster Bestiary to find out their weakness.
Amazing game, just explore everything
Wait till level 10. Regardless of the difficulty you get to be an an actual Witcher after level 10.  Oh and yea AVOID wolf packs at all costs. They WILL fuck you up no matter your level.
Alchemy is your best friend.

Every enemy in the game is weak to a particular kind of blade oil depending on what type of enemy they are, meaning that if you know the bestiary you can give yourself a 10-50% damage bonus simply by being a good witcher and applying it during a battle. 

There is a potion for every situation, whether it be low health (Swallow and White Raffard's Decoction), boosting your signs (Petri's Philter) and even utility potions like Cat and Killer Whale that let you see in the dark and spend long periods of time underwater, respectively (Cat is a godsend, btw).

There are also decoctions, potions made using monster mutagens with a powerful benefit that last a long time, but come with the cost of massively increasing your toxicity for as long as they are active, which can poison you if it gets too high. 

This, however, may be a blessing in disguise if you get the late game mutation, Euphoria, which massively increases your sword damage based on how high your current toxicity is. Just remember to use the White Honey potion to clear your toxicity if it does get too high, or use the Troll Decoction to out heal the poison damage. 

If you are looking to make a Euphoria build (bearing in mind this is very late game, but is considered the "best" build) or are just looking for effects that pair well together, a good combo of decoctions are Water Hag, Ekimmara and Katakan, with Troll in there if you have enough to Toxicity to spare.

I dont like using bombs, personally, but you need them for monster nests, they have a wide range of crowd control effects and are particularly useful against flying enemies.

Oh and, unrelated to Alchemy, Whirl is fucking awesome, and if you eventually get the Severance Runeword on your sword (after you pay the late game runewrite 30,000 fucking crowns) you become a meat blender of death, which pairs beautifully with the Decoctions I mentioned.
Welcome to the family, id say do the treasure hunts for Witcher gear to really open up the map, prioritize side quests, set up ya gwent deck with heroes and ability cards and watch the cutscenes ⚔️
Pay attention to monster weaknesses and oils and things like that.  You can really manipulate your hunts a bit more with some knowledge of what to do

And play the hell out of the DLC afterwards, it is amazing
Download magic spells mod if you want geralt to be ultimate sorcerer badass
Take your time , listen to the dialogue 
I like to get stoned 
Enjoy !
Take your time. Read some of the lore stuff you come across in game. Soak in this world because it’s one of the most well thought out, fleshed out, lived in worlds out there
This game will take a very long time to complete if you like to do everything as there’s literally 100s to 1000s of hours worth of content. Just play the way you want, and definitely don’t skip side quests, some of them give you permanent boosts to power with recipes for oils or explosives. A few in the dlcs will even give you the best silver and steel swords by far, and a certain option in the blood and wine dlc will give you some of the best armor in the game.
Do side quests
Play the game. Eye roll
Enjoy it!  Oh how I wish I could experience this for the first time again!
Fo the hattori quest in novigrad you will get the best sword ever.
Pet your horse
Choose Triss
Don’t try to avoid gwent.
I did, then 20+ hours later I was at a Gwent tournament. Just stir into it, let it happen.
Craft all potions and do all side stuff and undiscovered locations before leaving the first area. Keep some alcohol on you (its called something else in game can’t remember) keep weapons repaired. Enjoy the game and make your own decisions don’t search for what will happen trust me. It’s better this way
What seems like a good/Nobel/nice thing can have disastrous consequences down the line. Take special care if a choice seems to have no good options. Or one option is too good/Nobel. Sometimes the best option is only available after a specific dialogue path.

In my opinion (because IDGAF about spoilers) if you want to be the best person use a walkthrough for choices. But if you want a genuine, "what kind of witcher am I" kind of playthrough good luck.
USE CROSSBOWS UNDERWATER
First of all, have fun :)

Second, don't be afraid of choice!  There's several options that sometimes spawn several different results; repeat play is encouraged in this way but also leads to INCREDIBLE immersion.

Third, there is no optimal playstyle.  My first go through was with medium armour because Netflix, my second was with Cat School, and I'm about to hit Bear (these will eventually make sense).  Similarly, signs work how you want them to work.  Ease into the game and find what works for you.

Lastly, have fun :)

Cheers!

Borzag (a round of Gwent, perhaps?)
Take your time
Dont rush, enjoy and look around, immerse with the world
Understand how lucky you are and enjoy yourself. I’d love to experience this game for the first time all over again.
Do all side quests. Talk to people. Play it slow. 

If monsters are a lot higher level, come back later. 

Play gwent it’s fun.
Gwent is more important than you think. Start playing right away.
Play without any minimap. Open the map, try to find some ways to go to your objective, but take the chance to be lost, to discover some places you wouldn’t even imagine they were here, to look for impressive places, just in Velen you’ll find some amazing spots.
Explore as much as you can.
Don't play in easy.
Get into the flow of the roleplay.
Don't do threesom
Play Gwent.
Pursue all Romances
Go everywhere, do everything. It's probably the most beautiful game ever developed.
Enjoy 😊
One thing I didn’t understand for a long time was the potion system.  You will craft potions and then you have access to them forever and they refill as you rest.  It’s not like an inventory item.  So craft and use all the potions you can all game.
When the white frost comes, Do not eat the yellow snow.
Junk can start to weigh a lot.  If you must keep all those hides then offload them into your storage chest.
Immerse yourself in the story. There will be slow times, there will be sad times, there will be times you feel on top of the world just to fall off a cliff, its an amazing story and the dlcs are well worth it. Right and wrong are not always apparent, and most importantly, choose yen.
Buckle up and enjoy one of the gems that gaming industry has produced 👍🏻
Enjoy the side quests, and nature.
Get off reddit and play the damn game
    Haha I was as everyone was commenting. Made the post at my moms house
Pick up everything. Plants, monster items, food, and more dont count for weight. Sell all the other random items that do.
Remember that, when fights start to feel overwhelming, to keep going. By your third playthrough you'll be on death march in a towel and hardly break a sweat. The game is surprisingly "learnable".
Put. The. Baby. In. The. Oven.
Don't buy gear. Will probably find better gear out in the world, so save your money as much as you can.
Take your time to enjoy the scenery. 
Don't rush through the story.
It's ok to wait until you're higher leveled or better equipped before taking on a higher level contract, though don't be afraid to take on and try a higher level contract.
Hell yeah i got tips!

no mini map
no health bars
limited HUD

only real way to play is through self discovery
I wish I were you bro wipe my memory and start this game over again
Try to avoid wolf packs at the beginning. It gets better with the time, but still, the packs are a pain in the ass.
Kill all cows for loot.
Don't go to this subreddit or you potentially will see spoilers.
Enjoy it cuz every decision you make will have you doing multiple playthroughs just seeing what will happen..
Play gwent
throw the baby in the oven
SPIN TO WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN
Looking to dive in for the first time soon too, I bought it last year when they did the update but have been reading all the books first.
Crossbow for underwater kills
Take your time playing this game. Do all the side quest and earn more money. Go treasure hunt. There are many things to discover in this game, this is a rich game, full of myths and lores. Just like The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.
TAKE YOUR TIME
Play anyone who plays Gwent
Do all the available side quests before actually doing the main quest :)
If you are on pc and are a fan on combat you should considr the wnhanced edition. But then most of the combat tips here will be useless.
Don't rush take your time! Collect EVERYTHING even rubbish you can sell for money or dismantle. 
If you're playing gwent, there's a good app called "the witcher 3 checklist" 
It'll tell you where the cards are you're missing and you can mark off ones you've got. 
Aswell the app can track you're progress and mark off quests etc. 
Don't forget to use potions and decorations!
Most or all HAVE FUN. Welcome to the witcher world!
dont miss any side quests and explore the map
Do not hunt the wild
Don't be an alter ego of Barney Stinson. Stick to one woman.
Choose your love
Loot everything you can that isn't guarded. 

No shame in running from a fight you're not ready for. 

Practice your signs. Use the alchemy system. Upgrade your character when possible.

Keep your swords and armor in good repair. Blacksmiths will repair your gear for you.

Be a good dad. 

Always have one food item equipped on your quick-access menu. 

Explore, and enjoy!
Take your time. Explore and explore. Plus, okay Gwent!
Have fun, take it easy, enjoy the world, throw the baby in the furnace
Don't sell starting armor, or basically anything unique you come across
Baby oven! Put the baby in the oven
Get off reddit and play the game.
Kill lots of cows in the beginning  to sell the hides for quick coin
Coming to the end of my first playthrough, two things to suggest:

1. Increase the difficulty to a little more than you would normally. I've played for the first time recently, and halfway through, I upped the difficulty from Story and Sword! (Normal) to Blood and Broken Bones! (Hard). I normally play games on normal, but upping the difficulty really improved the game by compelling you to be more thoughtful of your actions and actually use the various signs, mutagens, potions, oils etc. Which I found out is incredibly fun, especially when you need to consult your beastiary to find the optimal ways to take down difficult opponents.
2. Some decisions required to get the good/bad endings of the game are often not 100% clear (part of the charm for some people I know). Some really interesting quest lines can be gate locked entirely if you make one innocuous choice or another (Namely, a quest called >!Reason of State!< if you're curious). If you, like me, strive for a good ending, consider Googling spoiler-free advice on game choices and how to watch out for them.

It's an incredibly game, have fun.
just explore, don't rush, sit tight.
You're gonna experience the greatest game ever made.
And choose your word wisely while doing main quest.
Have fun Witcher.
Don't rush. Don't accept contracts blindly. Check the level requirements in the quests tab, or you'll end up like me and you'll get stuck in a fight you can't win
For quick cash farm the cows in the starting town for their hide
Disable the mini map early.
yeah, just have fun
careful winds are howling
Throw the baby in the oven
Make sure you Jump Around on the Rooftops of Toussaint, for some reason it's MAD CLIMABLE....!! Also try to remember to bang Kiera, its a suprise tool that will help us later...!
Roach will only swim across oceans if you're not riding him.

Edit: fixed typo
Toss your coin to your witcher ✌️
Don't loot in front of guards
2 

Take your time and

have fun!
Don’t finish it or make sure you make the right choices
Play on the harder difficulties. Take your time
Do side quests as they appear. Knock them out prioritizing lower level quests over the higher level ones. Do side quests before you do main quests, as doing certain main quests will cut off certain side questd. At least discover all the ? Marks as you go to each continent. You won't be able to conquer them all yet. I use custom map markers on the places I can't defeat yet.
Appy ”Enemy Upscale” from the options!
Learn gwent, it’s fun
Get roach out of the water
don't eat the yellow snow
- immerse yourself in the world

- do as much side content as you can (question marks galore and side quests are awesome)

- play on Death March 

- Play gwent.

- DO NOT IGNORE ALCHEMY

- yrden is a cool sign

- mix armor sets especially witcher gear within the same class

- DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES KILL THE COWS AT WHITE ORCHARD

- hold space on equal ground as Roach while dismounted to pet them. 

- save relic weapons for later as spare cash when they get outdated or as scrappable items for rare materials, you'll find them again someday. 

- dumplings 

- parry humans, dodge monsters

- have fun
Here are a few things I learned:
- GET THAT FOOD PERK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  I didn't even realize that there were yellow perks. Made the game much more tougher for myself.
- SAVE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. There is death and situations worse than death everywhere around 
- Have a comedy light hearted series ready on the side. Witcher 3 makes you really think and there are no good endings. Just between lesser evil.
- GO OFF THE TRACK. That's where you'll have the most fun. Choose the road less walked on.
- Do as many side quests you can before the main quest. The main quest becomes easier but the DLCs kick your arse.
Remember to always shove forcefully.
Take your time
Don’t look up for help on reddit or anywhere else. Dive deep into the game. Feel the immersion. Experience it all by yourself.
Take off the next month of work
Make saves, properly. Trust it'll come in handy when you get addicted to the lore.
Genuinely envious of you, enjoy it. Immerse yourself in the world. Do as many quests as you can, gwent the shit out of the world and save often, lots of choices change the game so explore them as you go 

Without doubt for me the best game I’ve ever played
Characters WILL lie to you
Treat ciri well
Use the unicorn wisely.
Go for the viper blades
Throw the baby in the oven, you’ll understand once you get there
GWENT! that is all. Good luck
Don't rush it. Do the main quest with secondary quests inbetween. And enjoy it. After finishing the main quest you should get Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine DLCs. They're awesome and completed my Witcher experience
Do side quests more than the main plot. Explore out with Roach as far into the open as possible. Save often. And don't forget to take a break and catch a sunset from over the cliff sometimes.
Kill cows in white orchard, meditate till they respawn, repeat, sell their leathers
After you are finished with the game don't think you have seen everything. I have played this game many many times and still I find something new. I was watching a video on hearts of stone and I just realized there is more to a side quest than I thought. I played hearts of stone with every play through of the game and never new about it.
quen is king.
Don't give up on GWENT. It is amazing.
Dont eat yellow snow
Say goodbye to any form of social life 🤣🤣
There’s a nude mod for a Gerald
Steal everything from everyone and sell it to npcs. Just loot my man. Besides that, do not focus too much on combat, it aged bad. Focus on the narrative.
Don’t rush to the isle of mists, you’ll get a prompt on arrival telling you some quests will no longer be accessible so you shouldn’t miss it. 

Also let Whoreson Junior live
Steer clear of enemies with red numbers. They are higher leveled (unless you’re confident in yourself). Also hoard as much stuff as possible cuz items can be broken down made into something useful, just watch your weight limit cuz you wouldn’t want to be over encumbered. If you are over encumbered you can call on Roach for support/mobility. You’ll learn along the way so enjoy the game.
Me too!
Throw the baby in the oven
Pay attention to the details, the extra context in people's narratives. Immerse yourself in Geralt's POV. Don't just go to the marked locations ignoring what's around you. Play Gwent
Any question mark on the map is worth at least a little bit of time, im sure every one of us is envious of your first time because we all long for ours back.
Enjoy the world and explore. I suggest taking a look at witcher school gear sets and figuring out which one fits your playstyle best. The sets are great and can last you to end game and also require a bit of exploration to put together and upgrade.
Romance only Yen. The best ending ever.
Just love it all
Try alchemy and play on harder difficulty
Take your time with it and read the books
1. Pick lots of flowers. They're useful for crafting.

2. Kill groups of monsters for their parts (same reason as no 1)

3. Pay attention to small choices you have Geralt make because they often have profound effects on the world state later on. 

4. Have fun. There is no wrong way to build Geralt. Alchemy, sword, sign. Whatever you pick is fun and viable.
Alchemy brings a whole new level of ass beating when you get that toxicity limit real high.
Choose yennifer
Pick triss
Loot absolutely everything
Choose to romance two specific women at once, it's awesome
Have fun!
Dont check any tips and advice from anywhere,(no youtube, no tiktok no article etc) just play, with your own decisions. No more no less. If this game makes you cry, then cry, if makes you laugh, laugh a lot. :)
Enjoy it!!! It’s easily the best game of all time :)
Enjoy 😁
Already nearly half way through it! Not as well written as the others though, as if Think not as much time spent writing or editing it. .

Winds howling…
It really depends, are you trying to enjoy the game and use the armors as they come to you or you want to have the best armor there is?

Many people like to build armors but it is very gold consuming.

Since this is your first playthrough I recommend you to try to build only 1 full set. It gets very expensive, especially if you try to add runes and all of that.

The blood and wine expansion has the last level of upgrade for your witcher armor and it is very expensive.

In my current playthrough (first one for this new gen) I was able to get 1 set to Mastercraft quality and 1 set to grandmaster quality.

Also, do not be an aashole to NPCs unless they deserve it (the main characters included)
You see, they  have a tendency to remember that
MAKE CIRI HAPPY!!
Check notice boards and do Witcher contracts
Just enjoy you adventures and read more
Do ALL the side quests. Most, if not all of the side quests are just as compelling, rich, and worthy of your time as the main quest. Also, don't forget a round of gwent.
    When it comes to Gwent, battle every merchant and side quest Gwent mini boss without remorse
        No, skip every gwent encounter because it’s garbage and the worst mini game ever.
            Congratulations, you managed to have an opinion that is objectively false.
                Wrong
                    No sir, you… you are the one that is wrong
                    Lol. At least you tried.
                    lil bro can’t think two steps ahead what a moron
            I enjoy card games personally, but hey u dont or at least didn't like Gwent and that's ok
            Most people love Gwent. Your opinion only include the minority here.
            I HATE Gwent, but the completionist in me is screaming to do it anyway... please help me for the love of god
                My first playthrough I skipped it, but this time the completionist in me got to me too, you get used to Gwent and after awhile it's not that bad
                    It's not bad at all, in fact it's really well thought out, really fun, engaging, and full of lore and tons of great artwork.
                        The more I play it the more I like it.
                            The more you play the better cards you get so when you draw that Cirilla Card, you know you’re gonna wipe the floor with that merchant.
                                I've progressed a good bit so far, have maybe half the cards, the Ciri card I have. I've come to not mind the game and I'm liking it more, but it doesn't change the fact I picked up a controller and not a deck of cards for a specific reason, that reason being I don't like playing card games. Gwent is more like a CCG than a regular card game too which makes it even more annoying. I'm doing it for completion only, I won't be playing in subsequent playthroughs. I'm just happy I seem to be developing a tolerance.
                How can you hate it?
                My auto win gwent mod go brrr
            Once I got into Gwent I became obsessed. I think I skipped it entirely for the first 4 times I played the game thru.
    I would suggest this but with a side note. You don't have to do all the side quests at the time you get them. Especially if you feel overwhelmed. You can leave most of the side quests for after the main story's ending when you will probably want to have more witcher content.
    Along with this point about doing all quests: Watch the quest ‘Recommended levels’. Try to complete them while you’re still around the same level as the quest because if you over level too much, the XP rewards drop drastically. If over by like 5 levels, on some quests you might literally get only 1 XP.

Don’t worry about grinding for XP because a majority of your XP comes from completing the quests themselves(and Axii dialogue challenges, so max Delusion ASAP). The only time you should spend any time grinding is when you’re looking for specific monster parts.
Couldn't agree more. I rushed the story and skipped cutscenes every time and when I got Ciri I was like 'how'd she get here?'. Now I'm doing a second playthrough after 3 years doing every side quest and exhausting dialogue options. 

Take your time OP, don't rush things and immerse yourself. Post game depression is real.
    Never understood how people can play story games and skip all the cutscenes on the first playthrough
        ADHD hits me hard brother 😂
        Tbf, I skipped some cutscenes on some second quests, till I figured that those second quests were influencing the main ones. I'm planning to run it all again in NG+ and not skip one single second of conversation.
        I always always skipped cutscenes in games *until* I played this game.  Every single one is so immersive it would be a disservice to the game (and to yourself) not to watch them.
        Metal Gear Solid as a child and I only had 1 hour of playtime per day. 

I couldn't be watching all the cutscenes if I wanted to hide in a cardboard box and stay out of those viewcones.
        Well to be honest, I just got my new pc that time and I barely had enough time to play (just about one hour of gameplay per day) so I decided to skip through most of the scenes. 

It was when Geralt finally met Ciri and I didn't understand what happened because I skipped the scenes. I was confused about why she was suddenly there. I regretted that and now I always exhaust dialogue options and never skip cutscenes. I've learned my lesson.
    Just curious, as I have never done that in a game. Why rush and skip dialogue and cutscenes? Honestly just curious, no hate.
        Simple because people are impatient. It’s so annoying seeing people complain about games being “too hard” because they didn’t pay attention to cutscenes or dialogue.
When you give the sword at the bar. the feels are 2 strong
    Did that last night and that feeling never goes away no matter how many times you see it.
Even when it seems that you don't have time to do something, there are very few situations in which you don't have all the time in the world.
Only if you are told directly that you have until midnight of the same day for example is there an actual timer running, or just a marker at midnight. You can count all the times this happens in TW3, HoS, and B&W on one hand.
Even if you have a follower, they will always wait for you .here's a minor spoiler as an example, >! right at the very start of the game, at the end of the Yennefer cut-scene, you see the magic-crow fizzle out and the crystal skull fall to the ground, after your dream sequence—and the ghouls, ofc—you are practically right there where the Yennefer scene ended and the skull dropped to the ground. Get it? The skull? The ground? It's right there a few steps away for crying out loud! Use your witcher-senses and look for it, even though Vesemir might prod you to go, take your time and find it.!<
That's one of the first lessons you learn about the game, without it telling you, but you have to try it to learn it, which is probably actually the first lesson—look, just go do everything and you'll be good.
And have fun!
You say all. No need more words
Stole the words right out of my mouth. Inspect every little detail. EVERY LITTLE DETAIL.
last one is so real
Skip all these and emphasize the last one. Literally the most important plot point in W3
I didn't know I could use the crossbow underwater until like halfway through the game.....biggest eye opener for me.
    What did you use underwater before this?
        I just...didn't go in the water cuz I kept dying to the drowners
Today I learned!
The health bar tips were new to me and I’ve played the game three times by now. Have my upvote
Wait is Roach female?
You can cast a sign to calm the horse
Damn, this was good. The ending was great!
Hmmmm I'm one of those ppl who do like to c the bad and good ending, so I'll keep my save rdy
Out of context this sounds hilariously fucked up
IT ACTUALLY GIVES YOU THE GOOD ENDING TO THE QUEST OKAY?!😭
    Yes it does.

Witcher 3 is an example of good writing and execution overall. If you follow the dialogues carefully and look for what the character stands for then automatically you will go for the best outcome without trial and error of selecting different dialogues.
I just commented the same thing as it is now a canon event for me to comment this when someone says theyre just starting out 😂😂
    Putting the baby in the oven is a cannon event
Or triss about yen
    Or the Baby about the Oven
        You should absolutely tell the baby about the oven
            I will never forgive you that Freezer
        or the oven about triss
I like where this is going
came to comment the same
They are also incrediable fun
Abuse *everything*.

Seriously, I can't stress that enough.  The game gives you so many tools available.  Signs.  Mutagens.  Tailored gear sets.  Potions.  Specific builds.

Underutilizing any of it is detrimental unless you're playing on story mode.  Which really, is kind of cheap in this game.  You can just breeze through it without using much besides Igni.

Play on Sword and Story.  Or even Blood and Broken bones.  This is the way.  It will slow the game down just enough to properly enjoy it and utilize everything available to you to make it work.  Tailor it all.  It's so much more rewarding and fun.

That being said, stay the hell away from Death March until you have a couple playthroughs under your belt.  That shit is just punishment, lol.
    Died five times in the very first fight on DM 🤣
        Was losing my mind trying to beat 3 wolves.. but It gets way easier after level 8-10 just stick to it and abuse quen.. DM isn't really that hard and feels much better later in the game
            Started first play through on DM and it was brutal. Never beat it but didn't stick with it
    Death march is brutal in White Orchard. It gets a lot easier atleast as you get potions, oils a better gear.

When you get to the upper 20s of levels. It becomes a breeze. Only hard part is when it's a lot of wolves or smaller monsters. I take more damage in the fights than I do with one on one boss fights.

Now busy with act 2. Last trophy I need is to beat on DM
Yrden > Quen for me (all opinion)

Don’t need the shield if they’re too slow to hit me
    Eh. True. Counter point though, does Yrden give you health?
        No… :(

but when I upgrade it, it goes buzz buzz at people
            Lmao
        It rebuilds your stamina faster when you are in the Yrden trap, but I can’t recall at what point I unlocked that ability. 

My order for most fights = Yrden alternate; Yrden; Queen; Aard; Aard; Aard; Aard; Aard; Aard. 

I also have the cool ability((again)don’t know when I unlocked it) to deal extra damage to opponents with Aard while they’re in the Yrden trap.
    Bruh, aard is top notch. Yrden is only helpful for some monsters.
        I guess i have a very dodge/counter strike style — so it accents how I play the best.

Aard for those enemies that need interrupting more than slowing (or anything with wings!)
            Honestly as I was typing it, I knew I was being too extreme. They're all helpful for different scenarios.
        It took me way too long to realize that you can use Aard and Axii to slow down and one shot kill some opponents
I would advise not to abuse it actually. For me personally, the game got way too boring when I got the alternate Quen, it’s just too broken, makes the game super easy even playing on Death March. My next play through I didn’t get it and also tried not to use regular Quen as much. Had a lot more fun cause I had to rely more on other mechanics that were otherwise unnecessary in the first playthrough.
quen is overrated. it's all about igni and aard (with freeze upgrades)
Quen is so overpowered, especially if you level all the steps in the skill tree. Almost puts the game on easy mode.
Had to scroll for too long to find this.
I learned to always do that since Fable 1.
YES!!  Like a goddamn bandit.  LOOT IT ALLLLLLL!!!!
Skellige Smuggler Caches :(
Just finished the lady of the lake. Great books!
    If you haven't read Season of Storms, now is the perfect time. It takes place earlier in the story but is meant to be read last.
        i loved season of storms, it was a great way to end the series for me. felt like a breath of fresh air to just enjoy an adventure witchering with geralt and dandelion.
Along these lines, sell to the correct vendor. An armorer will pay more for armor than a weapons vendor.
Honestly the delusion skill is kind of a waste of a skillslot as using axii is often the most boring option out of all the dialogue options.

That being said it can be pretty cool at the start, and in some cases does make it easier, for example saving you some coin or stuff like that.
    I can see where you're coming from. I didn't really take the delusion skill seriously until I got to Novigrad. But even Geralt expresses his distaste for using Axii in dialogue with Lambert. I just liked being able to take that route especially when I'm short on playtime and want to progress in a quest.
Also, if you like a particular set visually even though you don't need it, keep it in the stash, don't sell everything... Won't say why but you'll see why it might be useful to keep some
That's just common sense.
Does this really give the good ending? You'd think removing the curse would be better
Good advice for any FromSoft game too lol.
She's a strong independent woman who can handle herself, right?
    She's >! Unconscious !< for most of the game anyway, she's not going anywhere.
Re the second point, I did not know that in my first playthrough, and I did every ? In Skellige
    Especially useful when on your Skellige ?-Tour and your boat is about to fall apart. You do not want to swim half an hour
the beastiary really helped me in the fight against a shaelmaar in a tourney. the aard sign to the wall is sick
Yep its like the rest are all side quest haha collect them all!!
some people want to watch the world burn
I had no clue that existed for like 10 hours into the game and was scavenging food everywhere.
It has been nerfed a bit with the upgraded version, sadly. Still useful but not as much.
    How was it nerfed?
        Gives less regen per second. But it also lasts longer now.
It helps when playing DM, because there is not really passive regen and meditation doesn't full your health bar. but eventually you get good at dodging/Quen and don't really lose much health. Good perk in early game. Not so good late game.
Wind's howling..
I always stick with what I decided unless it is just to c the other side of my decisions
    Dont even do that. Dont reload, just play it
    Some of those choices are not immediately obvious. You’re a father figure to Ciri, and your dialogue choices have long term consequences.
I like u and another guy making this out like a planned ambush disguised as a drug deal
From who?
    Spoilers
        I already finished the game. Tell me.
        who?
Yep yep yep.
    from who?
        Emhyr. 

ETA since this is an old thread what I mean fully is that, do not take Ciri to Emhyr. Ever. Take the choice she gives you of going straight after the crones.
I have a tendency in games, it is never planned I just get off track a lot, irl too, to get lost in the middle of doing quests, if some random npc calls me on the road or a town.
This is great advice until you start hearts of stone too late and level 40 frog prince dances on you for hours 😭

Edit: meant to say late
    …but it scales?
        I know, if your level is any higher that the recommended 32 it scales up and becomes much harder 😭 I fought him on level 40
            I haven’t read anything about down scaling! Interesting
                Yeah no it doesn’t scale down I don’t think
Can't do that for personal reasons
Ayo thanks 😂 That's why the question mark wasnt showing up on unexplored areas like the previous version thank you really.
Because i do remember doing multiple places of power and found only one thst too due to mission. I just completed White orchid Nd moved on to the palace
You forgot Ciri 🤨

She
Same here
Me three.  I've had this game fore years and finally have some time to play it!
You....people like you...you just want to watch the world burn
    It turns out well in the end if you get the ending i think ciri would have for herself. I stand by what i said 😂
    Or you get dandelion. Then its maybe not so good but hey, free music 😂😂
What I would NOT GIVE to be able to play again for the first time!!!
I'm doing it wrong, just can't bring myself to rob the peasants 🥲 I always feel sorry for them..
    Do not feel sorry, they have no needs for trinkets of such value! Use it to fuel a higher purpose! "Why would you let some nice things rot away in a peasant hut?"
A lesson learned from replaying MGS 2. Skipped every cutscene and missed the whole plot
    Everything is in the place because of some reason, everything was designed and developed piece by piece meaning anything useless would never have made it to the final game so, trust the developers and enjoy the game in slow pace but also commit to storyline.
I'm not getting better only worse. But I can't say anything in other subs cuz I get banned for a week again
Also I recommend doing every side quest. My first play through I streamlined the main story and was mad at myself for doing so afterward.
Haha I was as everyone was commenting. Made the post at my moms house
When it comes to Gwent, battle every merchant and side quest Gwent mini boss without remorse
    No, skip every gwent encounter because it’s garbage and the worst mini game ever.

I always always skipped cutscenes in games *until* I played this game.  Every single one is so immersive it would be a disservice to the game (and to yourself) not to watch them.
Metal Gear Solid as a child and I only had 1 hour of playtime per day. 

I couldn't be watching all the cutscenes if I wanted to hide in a cardboard box and stay out of those viewcones.
Well to be honest, I just got my new pc that time and I barely had enough time to play (just about one hour of gameplay per day) so I decided to skip through most of the scenes. 

It was when Geralt finally met Ciri and I didn't understand what happened because I skipped the scenes. I was confused about why she was suddenly there. I regretted that and now I always exhaust dialogue options and never skip cutscenes. I've learned my lesson.
Simple because people are impatient. It’s so annoying seeing people complain about games being “too hard” because they didn’t pay attention to cutscenes or dialogue.
I just...didn't go in the water cuz I kept dying to the drowners
You should absolutely tell the baby about the oven
    I will never forgive you that Freezer
or the oven about triss
Was losing my mind trying to beat 3 wolves.. but It gets way easier after level 8-10 just stick to it and abuse quen.. DM isn't really that hard and feels much better later in the game
    Started first play through on DM and it was brutal. Never beat it but didn't stick with it
No… :(

but when I upgrade it, it goes buzz buzz at people
    Lmao
It rebuilds your stamina faster when you are in the Yrden trap, but I can’t recall at what point I unlocked that ability. 

My order for most fights = Yrden alternate; Yrden; Queen; Aard; Aard; Aard; Aard; Aard; Aard. 

I also have the cool ability((again)don’t know when I unlocked it) to deal extra damage to opponents with Aard while they’re in the Yrden trap.
I guess i have a very dodge/counter strike style — so it accents how I play the best.

Aard for those enemies that need interrupting more than slowing (or anything with wings!)
    Honestly as I was typing it, I knew I was being too extreme. They're all helpful for different scenarios.
It took me way too long to realize that you can use Aard and Axii to slow down and one shot kill some opponents
i loved season of storms, it was a great way to end the series for me. felt like a breath of fresh air to just enjoy an adventure witchering with geralt and dandelion.
Gives less regen per second. But it also lasts longer now.
It helps when playing DM, because there is not really passive regen and meditation doesn't full your health bar. but eventually you get good at dodging/Quen and don't really lose much health. Good perk in early game. Not so good late game.
I already finished the game. Tell me.
who?
Emhyr. 

ETA since this is an old thread what I mean fully is that, do not take Ciri to Emhyr. Ever. Take the choice she gives you of going straight after the crones.
I know, if your level is any higher that the recommended 32 it scales up and becomes much harder 😭 I fought him on level 40
    I haven’t read anything about down scaling! Interesting
        Yeah no it doesn’t scale down I don’t think
Congratulations, you managed to have an opinion that is objectively false.
    Wrong
        No sir, you… you are the one that is wrong
        Lol. At least you tried.
        lil bro can’t think two steps ahead what a moron
I enjoy card games personally, but hey u dont or at least didn't like Gwent and that's ok
Most people love Gwent. Your opinion only include the minority here.
I HATE Gwent, but the completionist in me is screaming to do it anyway... please help me for the love of god
    My first playthrough I skipped it, but this time the completionist in me got to me too, you get used to Gwent and after awhile it's not that bad
        It's not bad at all, in fact it's really well thought out, really fun, engaging, and full of lore and tons of great artwork.
            The more I play it the more I like it.
                The more you play the better cards you get so when you draw that Cirilla Card, you know you’re gonna wipe the floor with that merchant.
                    I've progressed a good bit so far, have maybe half the cards, the Ciri card I have. I've come to not mind the game and I'm liking it more, but it doesn't change the fact I picked up a controller and not a deck of cards for a specific reason, that reason being I don't like playing card games. Gwent is more like a CCG than a regular card game too which makes it even more annoying. I'm doing it for completion only, I won't be playing in subsequent playthroughs. I'm just happy I seem to be developing a tolerance.
    How can you hate it?
    My auto win gwent mod go brrr
Once I got into Gwent I became obsessed. I think I skipped it entirely for the first 4 times I played the game thru.
I will never forgive you that Freezer
