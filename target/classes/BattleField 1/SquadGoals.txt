[[#SquadGoals]]





You can't have a white ranger and a green ranger. They're the same person. 
    Wasn't  he also the red ranger at a certain point?
        I don't remember that.
            I guess he was the Red Zeo ranger and the first Rwd Turbo ranger.  Had to look it up
                Are those later seasons? I'm only talking about Mighty Morphin', lol.
                    I guess so man lol
                        He was also the black ranger in Dino thunder
                            Are these "he"s all the same Tommy actor from the Mighty Morphin? Or is it just some green ranger changing suits?
                                Same actor
                                    Wow that's nuts. I remember losing my shit when the green ranger showed up, even had the VHS episodes of the introduction of the green ranger. Then he turned into the white ranger and my little head exploded.
                            I thought he was talking about the truck Ranger. Fuck
                    Yeah, it's the two afterwards, Zeo and Turbo. 

I kept watching for far longer than I should have...
                    Mighty morphin had 4 seasons then the storyline remained consistent up untill galaxy. The next season "lightspeed rescue was the first power Rangers series to not be a continuation of the last
                        I stopped watching or caring after 2nd grade or so.
                    Eh, zeo and turbo were all part of the same story arc anyway. (Called the zordon era)
                > [RWD Turbo](http://pictures.topspeed.com/IMG/jpg/200512/2001-mazda-rx7-6.jpg)
                    Would love to own one !
                        You can only rent the apex seals though.
                            That feel when they are finally worn out :(
                        rather an FC
                    Proper choice.
                    It took me 5 hours to realize my typo before I got this joke. Gave me a good laugh though. Thanks for that lol
                Ford wasn't putting turbos on rangers back then.  fingers crossed for the new one in 2018
                    Turbo diesel rangers in Europe right now zzz
                Pretty sure he was also a Dino Ranger at some point, too.  ...I think.  It's been too long for my memory.
        Nah red ranger was a separate guy. Jason I believe. He was originally the 'leader' role but then came Tommy. The bad boy pony tail havin green ranger who eventually became the white ranger. 
            But Jason came back later as Gold Ranger with a giant pyramid zord:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysRK875IRwM

But green ranger was coolest because he summoned his zord with jazz flute: https://youtu.be/CYnKsuxtz50?t=19
                Man i still remember the jazz flute sound it makes to summon him. Shit
                    I had a plastic version of his dagger/flute that was my most prized toy for a while.
                Also, he's basically summoning Mecha Godzilla. Which is pretty awesome.
                First clip ended too soon. I really wanted to see how the pyramid thing fights.
                    Can't find any fight videos from the show but it was pretty much identical to the toy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ll2DcF6kNFQ

Here's how it fought solo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdG_MYPq2lc
            Tommy was also the Red Zeo & Turbo Ranger and eventually the Black Dino Thunder Ranger.
            Isn't it the opposite, white Ranger became green when he turned into a good guy?
                I think he started as the green ranger and was bad. Then became good while still green and eventually transitioned to white. 
                    Yes. 
        [deleted]
            Oh Kimberly üòè
            There were 3 season of Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. He was Green and then White during that season. He became the Red Ranger in Power Rangers Zeo  and continued to be Red in Power Rangers Turbo. Zeo and Turbo are the 4th and 5th Power Rangers 'seasons', though they are typically referred to by name instead of by season number. Very few people would say that Tommy came back to become the Black Ranger in season 12, they would say that he came back in Power Rangers Dino Thunder. 
        No, but Jason did wear the gold armor from the green rangers uniform at one point. 
        No. The original red ranger did come back as the gold ranger though.
            Uh yes, he was eventually a Red ranger. 
                But not until Zeo
        He was Green, White, Red, Black in that order.

Green & White Mighty Morphin', Red Zeo/Turbo & Black Dino Thunder.
        The red ranger wore the green rangers vest once because it healed him, but I don't think they were the same.
        No
        He was the red ranger in zeo and then later in Dino Thunder he became the black ranger he is a legend.
        Wasn't everyone a red ranger at some point?
        He's been the most colors of any ranger, he's also been the black ranger.
    #Ruined
    Logged in to say this. Tommy is both characters. Keep the green, add the pink. 
        Whoa whoa... Where's the black ranger. I'm sorry gotta keep it og.
            Yup. If anything it should be Black/Blue/Red/Pink/Yellow IMO.
            I don't have any black friends ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø 
            He's at a black power rangers lives matter rally. 
        That would be "faggy".
    Should have just gone for the og ranger team with the black and pink rangers.   
  
/#fucktommy
        Every other kid was all about Tommy, but I hated that showboating jerk with a one man megazord THAT'S NOT EVEN FAIR
    http://powerrangers.wikia.com/wiki/Tom_Oliver is a clone of Tommy Oliver and also is the 2nd green ranger
    Yeah this shit is fucking RACIST AS HELL!!! WHERES THE MUTHAFUCKING BLACK RANGER?! Merry fucking Christmas. 
        Wasn't the black ranger an Asian guy? I know yellow was a black girl.
            The black ranger was a black guy and the yellow ranger was an Asian girl. 
                You're both right. Mighty Morphin had a black guy as  the Black Ranger and an Asian girl as the Yellow Ranger first. Later, there was an Asian guy as the Black Ranger and a black girl as the Yellow Ranger 
                debbie downer, yellow ranger asian girl is dead
                    Fuck man, in 2001 when she was 27 :( 

Edit: I didn't scroll down to see someone already mentioned this in another comment chain -_- my bad
    In Super Sentai, they were from completely different series (Green and White from Kyoryu Sentai Zyuranger and Gosei Sentai Dairanger, respectively), so it checks out.
    deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.7396  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/87977)
        Well, he was the mastodon before the movie. 
    dude spoilers
    Spoilers 
        You're right, my bad. 
    Might as well throw Gold Ranger up there.
    Not in the Japanese version.
    There ain't no black rangers. 
        Yellow was a black chick.
            Not in the original Mighty Morphin, which is the only one that matters.  She was an Asian girl, who is now dead.  RIP
    Woah did you never see the episode where Tommy the white ranger fights Tommy the green ranger?
    There was an anniversary where the same person was on the screen about 3 or 4 times. I can't believe anything any more. 
    Thank you!!! That was my first thought when i saw this.
    came to comment this

    They forgot the black ranger... he was my favorite too, woolly mammoth FTW
    Well nobody wanted to be the black guy
    I'm so glad someone said it
    I read this as #SquidGoals and it still applied.
    Yeah,  and wants the green ranger evil?

    Fucking Kevin.
        Kevin is a legit pylon
        My name being Kevin and being terrible at this game, I got a bit paranoid reading your comment.
    That's when you kick that dude out and recruit a new teenager with attitude. 
Fake

Everyone knows it's impossible for more than one person in the top 5 to get a battle pack. 
    Well its not that its the fact that theres so few battlepacks. Meaning there were probably only like 12 people in the game. 
        This is the amount of Battlepacks given for smaller game modes since they're quicker.  War pigeons, dominations, etc.
            Ya but no one plays those. 
                Look at the picture it's tdm
                Rush is also a part of that smaller game mode group. Your telling me no one plays Rush? 
                Simply not true.  I know plenty of people who came over from COD and prefer those game types.
                    I haven't come over from COD but War Pigeons is so godamn fun. No running across the map for half an hour, just straight up killing. Although I enjoy conquest from time to time
                I decided to play a couple or rounds of team death match for the first time when I got my new 144hz monitor--so butter smooth, was on a roll that night, I think I got like five battlepacks in a row. It will never happen again.
    Are you serious? If it is that's bullshit because I'm almost always in the top 5.
    I'm pretty new playing the game, do you ever get good things out of battle packs? All I get is pistols and skins for pistols

            so how does the battlepack system work I don't want to have a heart attack by drinking all this Monster Energy lol
                [deleted]
                    okay it sounds like in the post there was a certain way you can get battlepacks 
                        [deleted]
                            I don't know it seems like this game don't explain anything correctly a lot of the guns don't even match with the stats we didn't have this type of problem in Battlefield 3 
        Pretty much no. It's all dumb skins and what not. 
        You can get skins for weapons and vehicles, melee puzzle pieces and squad xp boosts. You can buy battle packs for real money or for scraps. 
    I joined a server right on the moment the victory screen was coming and got a Battlepack. That  is absolutely unsatisfying.

    Well played! The reactions at the end are awesome!
    How do you get custom avatars on PS4?! I can't get them!!!
        You can use the PlayStation app on your phone. You can also put pictures on ur PS4 with a USB I'm pretty sure, and you can probably do it on their website. 
            I have a profile picture and a selected avatar but i cant get my profile picture to be public, the only options are close friends
                Oh damn that I have no idea, I've had a custom profile pic but I guess it was never public. I only play with friends so never really noticed. 
                    Oh. I'm stupid. You were playing with friends, that's how you can see each other's profile pictures haha.
        Those aren't actually custom avatars in that vid
        [deleted]
            I figured it out like right after posting lol... The only way people can see your profile picture is if they're close friends with you.

Also, I didn't know there were power ranger profile pictures on the store. Gonna have to cop now
    That was beautiful!
#squadgoals
What, No black ranger?
    The military was segregated back then
        should we tell dice
        Yet there's a female ranger? You won't find one on the frontline! It's historically inaccurate.
    Seem like they'd rather break all logic and have the same white Ranger twice (green and white are the same guy) than have a black one. Smh
    Even now, now, very now, an old black ram is tupping your ~~white~~ pink ewe.
    He would be up there if most deaths counted. 
    [deleted]
        Is there another way to say it? How about...black?
            [deleted]
                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GwAHEgOxuU
    RACISM. 
"Look at this team! We're gonna do great!"
    AWWWWWW YEAAAH
        Can't stop. Won't stop.
    Ohhooo turn it up!
    Now look at this team, that I just found...
How many attempts did this take!? 
    Took two nights of playing lol
        Pretty fucking sweet though
        Is there a trophies by any chance.

            Unfortunately there is no trophy for the full squad on top medals. But we felt fairly accomplished afterwards lol
        How do you even import your pictures like that?! All I get is the damn avatar from the PS4 options available!
            I hit the share button to upload to Facebook, then copied and pasted it to Reddit. I think you can upload to twitter as well. 
                No, I mean for changing your in-game pictures to the PowerRangers!!!
                    They are the "avatars" on PS4. You can edit your profile and get "premium avatars" through the PlayStation store. They cost $0.99 each 
                    On pc when I select the option to change my avatar, it takes me to ea.com. Maybe try logging in to that? 
        It's a good thing you died at least once. On PC at least it won't give you credit if you have zero deaths. A 23-0 will not show up and credit will go to somebody with 4 k/d or something. 

Somebody at DICE was stupid enough to put a check not to divide by zero probably. 
        I guess activities like this are necessary to keep the game enjoyable.
Literally
Lol I believe this is legit because the person with the 23k/d didn't get a battlepack in TDM
Are you guys apart of some sort of team or something?
    We are all friends on PSN and play a lot together. 
        I guessed as much, I was making a joke.
 Love that they took this from battlefront, it feels so good to have your picture up there instead of just a name at the top of the scoreboard
Thats a squad i wouldnt mess with. You guys probably ran the server.
How to profile pics work on PS4? Is there custom pictures?
    [deleted]
        You can change it on the psn app. 
            Yeah but that's only for your profile picture, which isn't public; only those who you've revealed your real name to can see your profile picture.

Your avatar is what everyone can see, and cannot be customized. You have to select from a pool of premade avatars.
                Oh ok I guess I never noticed because I always play with friends. 
Pink and Black Ranger off camera doing butt stuff 
Lmao
So awesome!!!!
Dat kd tho 
Nice one m8!
Does anyone know how to change that picutre on ps4?
Totally unrealistic. The red ranger would obviously be in the middle. 
Pretty awesome squad üëçüôå
Those are avatars right? Or did they upload their own pics?
    Avatars. Technically "premium avatars" purchased for $1
The question is:  how many rounds to get that one right?
    A million 
        And achieve you did
I hopefully get this game today. I cannot wait! 
I love it :) üí™üèª tell ImmortalVamp he's slacking, supposed to be in the middle üòâüòú‚úåüèªÔ∏è
God, I wish I had friends. 
lmao
Makes me sad they got rid of avatar emblems for end of round highlights. I used to love seeing the ridiculous pictures after every match.
Hook me up with those pics!
How do people get custom pictures like that. im on ps4
    There a power ranger avatar pack. We were on ps4 too 
RIP Pink Ranger
Needs more pink ranger
Pink?
It's a Christmas Miracle!
you have to choose green or white. and if you're choosing green it can only be when the monster stops listening to your commands and attacks both parties so you have to team up.... 

Either way you need Zack. His axe was a fucking laser gun!
no black Ranger Johnny Yong Bosch would be pissed

this is fucking *AWESOME*
TDM WutFace
This makes me chuckle 
Only 4 headshots? Everyone else must have been terrible.
Has anyone been able to make this shit work? I've updated my pic months ago and it doesn't work.
    Try restarting your app if you haven't done so. (Which I assume you have.) I had the same problem. 
        I have the app but i don't see it in there.  I was using the app from the website battlelog.  I wish the instructions for this were clearer.
I was about to say how did you get that gamer picture on your Xbox but then I notice your on PS4
I always thought the black gold and white ranger was the coolest 
Must've been an easy game if the highest assault score was in the 1600's
It's just TDM though...
now do conquest!
Why no pink ranger? 
and there's fuckin billy.... not having a clue as to what he's doing in that picture
This is actually fucking amazing. Good job to all of you!
Main highlight reel :O
    Appreciate that Zea1ot! You can check out the video from the game from "ImmortalVamps" comment. He posted his link. We got 4 out of 5 top medals the previous game because the blue ranger game stopped working.

        Lol you gotta buy those!?
            Yes. For console you can only change your profile picture to anything. Not your avatar picture. Its to protect from people having avatars like nudity, racism in game etc.
                Ahh so like half the avatars on PC lol
2042 be like
Wasn't  he also the red ranger at a certain point?
    I don't remember that.
        I guess he was the Red Zeo ranger and the first Rwd Turbo ranger.  Had to look it up
            Are those later seasons? I'm only talking about Mighty Morphin', lol.
                I guess so man lol
                    He was also the black ranger in Dino thunder
                        Are these "he"s all the same Tommy actor from the Mighty Morphin? Or is it just some green ranger changing suits?
                            Same actor
                                Wow that's nuts. I remember losing my shit when the green ranger showed up, even had the VHS episodes of the introduction of the green ranger. Then he turned into the white ranger and my little head exploded.
                        I thought he was talking about the truck Ranger. Fuck
                Yeah, it's the two afterwards, Zeo and Turbo. 

I kept watching for far longer than I should have...
                Mighty morphin had 4 seasons then the storyline remained consistent up untill galaxy. The next season "lightspeed rescue was the first power Rangers series to not be a continuation of the last
                    I stopped watching or caring after 2nd grade or so.
                Eh, zeo and turbo were all part of the same story arc anyway. (Called the zordon era)

            Ford wasn't putting turbos on rangers back then.  fingers crossed for the new one in 2018
                Turbo diesel rangers in Europe right now zzz
            Pretty sure he was also a Dino Ranger at some point, too.  ...I think.  It's been too long for my memory.
    Nah red ranger was a separate guy. Jason I believe. He was originally the 'leader' role but then came Tommy. The bad boy pony tail havin green ranger who eventually became the white ranger. 
        But Jason came back later as Gold Ranger with a giant pyramid zord:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysRK875IRwM

But green ranger was coolest because he summoned his zord with jazz flute: https://youtu.be/CYnKsuxtz50?t=19
            Man i still remember the jazz flute sound it makes to summon him. Shit
                I had a plastic version of his dagger/flute that was my most prized toy for a while.
            Also, he's basically summoning Mecha Godzilla. Which is pretty awesome.
            First clip ended too soon. I really wanted to see how the pyramid thing fights.
                Can't find any fight videos from the show but it was pretty much identical to the toy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ll2DcF6kNFQ

Here's how it fought solo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdG_MYPq2lc
        Tommy was also the Red Zeo & Turbo Ranger and eventually the Black Dino Thunder Ranger.
        Isn't it the opposite, white Ranger became green when he turned into a good guy?
            I think he started as the green ranger and was bad. Then became good while still green and eventually transitioned to white. 
                Yes.

        Oh Kimberly üòè
        There were 3 season of Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. He was Green and then White during that season. He became the Red Ranger in Power Rangers Zeo  and continued to be Red in Power Rangers Turbo. Zeo and Turbo are the 4th and 5th Power Rangers 'seasons', though they are typically referred to by name instead of by season number. Very few people would say that Tommy came back to become the Black Ranger in season 12, they would say that he came back in Power Rangers Dino Thunder. 
    No, but Jason did wear the gold armor from the green rangers uniform at one point. 
    No. The original red ranger did come back as the gold ranger though.
        Uh yes, he was eventually a Red ranger. 
            But not until Zeo
    He was Green, White, Red, Black in that order.

Green & White Mighty Morphin', Red Zeo/Turbo & Black Dino Thunder.
    The red ranger wore the green rangers vest once because it healed him, but I don't think they were the same.
    No
    He was the red ranger in zeo and then later in Dino Thunder he became the black ranger he is a legend.
    Wasn't everyone a red ranger at some point?
    He's been the most colors of any ranger, he's also been the black ranger.
#Ruined
Logged in to say this. Tommy is both characters. Keep the green, add the pink. 
    Whoa whoa... Where's the black ranger. I'm sorry gotta keep it og.
        Yup. If anything it should be Black/Blue/Red/Pink/Yellow IMO.
        I don't have any black friends ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø 
        He's at a black power rangers lives matter rally. 
    That would be "faggy".
Should have just gone for the og ranger team with the black and pink rangers.   
  
/#fucktommy
    Every other kid was all about Tommy, but I hated that showboating jerk with a one man megazord THAT'S NOT EVEN FAIR
http://powerrangers.wikia.com/wiki/Tom_Oliver is a clone of Tommy Oliver and also is the 2nd green ranger
Yeah this shit is fucking RACIST AS HELL!!! WHERES THE MUTHAFUCKING BLACK RANGER?! Merry fucking Christmas. 
    Wasn't the black ranger an Asian guy? I know yellow was a black girl.
        The black ranger was a black guy and the yellow ranger was an Asian girl. 
            You're both right. Mighty Morphin had a black guy as  the Black Ranger and an Asian girl as the Yellow Ranger first. Later, there was an Asian guy as the Black Ranger and a black girl as the Yellow Ranger 
            debbie downer, yellow ranger asian girl is dead
                Fuck man, in 2001 when she was 27 :( 

Edit: I didn't scroll down to see someone already mentioned this in another comment chain -_- my bad
In Super Sentai, they were from completely different series (Green and White from Kyoryu Sentai Zyuranger and Gosei Sentai Dairanger, respectively), so it checks out.
deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.7396  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/87977)
    Well, he was the mastodon before the movie. 
dude spoilers
Spoilers 
    You're right, my bad. 
Might as well throw Gold Ranger up there.
Not in the Japanese version.
There ain't no black rangers. 
    Yellow was a black chick.
        Not in the original Mighty Morphin, which is the only one that matters.  She was an Asian girl, who is now dead.  RIP
Woah did you never see the episode where Tommy the white ranger fights Tommy the green ranger?
There was an anniversary where the same person was on the screen about 3 or 4 times. I can't believe anything any more. 
Thank you!!! That was my first thought when i saw this.
came to comment this

They forgot the black ranger... he was my favorite too, woolly mammoth FTW
Well nobody wanted to be the black guy
I'm so glad someone said it
I read this as #SquidGoals and it still applied.
Yeah,  and wants the green ranger evil?

Fucking Kevin.
    Kevin is a legit pylon
    My name being Kevin and being terrible at this game, I got a bit paranoid reading your comment.
That's when you kick that dude out and recruit a new teenager with attitude. 
Well its not that its the fact that theres so few battlepacks. Meaning there were probably only like 12 people in the game. 
    This is the amount of Battlepacks given for smaller game modes since they're quicker.  War pigeons, dominations, etc.
        Ya but no one plays those. 
            Look at the picture it's tdm
            Rush is also a part of that smaller game mode group. Your telling me no one plays Rush? 
            Simply not true.  I know plenty of people who came over from COD and prefer those game types.
                I haven't come over from COD but War Pigeons is so godamn fun. No running across the map for half an hour, just straight up killing. Although I enjoy conquest from time to time
            I decided to play a couple or rounds of team death match for the first time when I got my new 144hz monitor--so butter smooth, was on a roll that night, I think I got like five battlepacks in a row. It will never happen again.
Are you serious? If it is that's bullshit because I'm almost always in the top 5.
I'm pretty new playing the game, do you ever get good things out of battle packs? All I get is pistols and skins for pistols

        so how does the battlepack system work I don't want to have a heart attack by drinking all this Monster Energy lol
            [deleted]
                okay it sounds like in the post there was a certain way you can get battlepacks 
                    [deleted]
                        I don't know it seems like this game don't explain anything correctly a lot of the guns don't even match with the stats we didn't have this type of problem in Battlefield 3 
    Pretty much no. It's all dumb skins and what not. 
    You can get skins for weapons and vehicles, melee puzzle pieces and squad xp boosts. You can buy battle packs for real money or for scraps. 
I joined a server right on the moment the victory screen was coming and got a Battlepack. That  is absolutely unsatisfying.
Shoop shoop ba-doops shoop ba-doop
Well played! The reactions at the end are awesome!
How do you get custom avatars on PS4?! I can't get them!!!
    You can use the PlayStation app on your phone. You can also put pictures on ur PS4 with a USB I'm pretty sure, and you can probably do it on their website. 
        I have a profile picture and a selected avatar but i cant get my profile picture to be public, the only options are close friends
            Oh damn that I have no idea, I've had a custom profile pic but I guess it was never public. I only play with friends so never really noticed. 
                Oh. I'm stupid. You were playing with friends, that's how you can see each other's profile pictures haha.
    Those aren't actually custom avatars in that vid
    [deleted]
        I figured it out like right after posting lol... The only way people can see your profile picture is if they're close friends with you.

Also, I didn't know there were power ranger profile pictures on the store. Gonna have to cop now
That was beautiful!
#squadgoals
The military was segregated back then
    should we tell dice
    Yet there's a female ranger? You won't find one on the frontline! It's historically inaccurate.
Seem like they'd rather break all logic and have the same white Ranger twice (green and white are the same guy) than have a black one. Smh
Even now, now, very now, an old black ram is tupping your ~~white~~ pink ewe.
He would be up there if most deaths counted. 
[deleted]
    Is there another way to say it? How about...black?

RACISM. 
AWWWWWW YEAAAH
    Can't stop. Won't stop.
Ohhooo turn it up!
Now look at this team, that I just found...
Took two nights of playing lol
    Pretty fucking sweet though
    Is there a trophies by any chance.

        Unfortunately there is no trophy for the full squad on top medals. But we felt fairly accomplished afterwards lol
    How do you even import your pictures like that?! All I get is the damn avatar from the PS4 options available!
        I hit the share button to upload to Facebook, then copied and pasted it to Reddit. I think you can upload to twitter as well. 
            No, I mean for changing your in-game pictures to the PowerRangers!!!
                They are the "avatars" on PS4. You can edit your profile and get "premium avatars" through the PlayStation store. They cost $0.99 each 
                On pc when I select the option to change my avatar, it takes me to ea.com. Maybe try logging in to that? 
    It's a good thing you died at least once. On PC at least it won't give you credit if you have zero deaths. A 23-0 will not show up and credit will go to somebody with 4 k/d or something. 

Somebody at DICE was stupid enough to put a check not to divide by zero probably. 
    I guess activities like this are necessary to keep the game enjoyable.
We are all friends on PSN and play a lot together. 
    I guessed as much, I was making a joke.
[deleted]
    You can change it on the psn app. 
        Yeah but that's only for your profile picture, which isn't public; only those who you've revealed your real name to can see your profile picture.

Your avatar is what everyone can see, and cannot be customized. You have to select from a pool of premade avatars.
            Oh ok I guess I never noticed because I always play with friends. 
Avatars. Technically "premium avatars" purchased for $1
A million 
    And achieve you did
There a power ranger avatar pack. We were on ps4 too 
Try restarting your app if you haven't done so. (Which I assume you have.) I had the same problem. 
    I have the app but i don't see it in there.  I was using the app from the website battlelog.  I wish the instructions for this were clearer.
Appreciate that Zea1ot! You can check out the video from the game from "ImmortalVamps" comment. He posted his link. We got 4 out of 5 top medals the previous game because the blue ranger game stopped working. 
This is probably a screenshot from PC
    But playing with a controller üòµ
It's from an Avatar pack sold on the psn 
You can buy these avatars in the Playstation Store.
https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-us/games/avatars/power-rangers-action-pose-avatar-bundle/cid=UP2135-CUSA04242_00-MMPRACTIONBUNDLE
Lol there's video proof in the comments guy. You just mad you don't have 4 friends to play with like them. 
Yes. 
you can buy them off the PS Store and chang them using the psn app.
[removed]
    Are you a bot
Played on ps4

here is the full vid of them getting this So NO photoshop https://youtu.be/NhP4NnwBCNE

    Lol you gotta buy those!?
        Yes. For console you can only change your profile picture to anything. Not your avatar picture. Its to protect from people having avatars like nudity, racism in game etc.
            Ahh so like half the avatars on PC lol
I don't remember that.
    I guess he was the Red Zeo ranger and the first Rwd Turbo ranger.  Had to look it up
        Are those later seasons? I'm only talking about Mighty Morphin', lol.
            I guess so man lol
                He was also the black ranger in Dino thunder
                    Are these "he"s all the same Tommy actor from the Mighty Morphin? Or is it just some green ranger changing suits?
                        Same actor
                            Wow that's nuts. I remember losing my shit when the green ranger showed up, even had the VHS episodes of the introduction of the green ranger. Then he turned into the white ranger and my little head exploded.
                    I thought he was talking about the truck Ranger. Fuck
            Yeah, it's the two afterwards, Zeo and Turbo. 

I kept watching for far longer than I should have...
            Mighty morphin had 4 seasons then the storyline remained consistent up untill galaxy. The next season "lightspeed rescue was the first power Rangers series to not be a continuation of the last
                I stopped watching or caring after 2nd grade or so.
            Eh, zeo and turbo were all part of the same story arc anyway. (Called the zordon era)

    Also, he's basically summoning Mecha Godzilla. Which is pretty awesome.
    First clip ended too soon. I really wanted to see how the pyramid thing fights.
        Can't find any fight videos from the show but it was pretty much identical to the toy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ll2DcF6kNFQ

Here's how it fought solo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdG_MYPq2lc
Tommy was also the Red Zeo & Turbo Ranger and eventually the Black Dino Thunder Ranger.
Isn't it the opposite, white Ranger became green when he turned into a good guy?
    I think he started as the green ranger and was bad. Then became good while still green and eventually transitioned to white. 
        Yes. 
Oh Kimberly üòè
There were 3 season of Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. He was Green and then White during that season. He became the Red Ranger in Power Rangers Zeo  and continued to be Red in Power Rangers Turbo. Zeo and Turbo are the 4th and 5th Power Rangers 'seasons', though they are typically referred to by name instead of by season number. Very few people would say that Tommy came back to become the Black Ranger in season 12, they would say that he came back in Power Rangers Dino Thunder. 
Uh yes, he was eventually a Red ranger. 
    But not until Zeo
Yup. If anything it should be Black/Blue/Red/Pink/Yellow IMO.
I don't have any black friends ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø 
He's at a black power rangers lives matter rally. 
The black ranger was a black guy and the yellow ranger was an Asian girl. 
    You're both right. Mighty Morphin had a black guy as  the Black Ranger and an Asian girl as the Yellow Ranger first. Later, there was an Asian guy as the Black Ranger and a black girl as the Yellow Ranger 
    debbie downer, yellow ranger asian girl is dead
        Fuck man, in 2001 when she was 27 :( 

Edit: I didn't scroll down to see someone already mentioned this in another comment chain -_- my bad
Not in the original Mighty Morphin, which is the only one that matters.  She was an Asian girl, who is now dead.  RIP
Ya but no one plays those. 
    Look at the picture it's tdm
    Rush is also a part of that smaller game mode group. Your telling me no one plays Rush? 
    Simply not true.  I know plenty of people who came over from COD and prefer those game types.
        I haven't come over from COD but War Pigeons is so godamn fun. No running across the map for half an hour, just straight up killing. Although I enjoy conquest from time to time
    I decided to play a couple or rounds of team death match for the first time when I got my new 144hz monitor--so butter smooth, was on a roll that night, I think I got like five battlepacks in a row. It will never happen again.

so how does the battlepack system work I don't want to have a heart attack by drinking all this Monster Energy lol
    [deleted]
        okay it sounds like in the post there was a certain way you can get battlepacks 
            [deleted]
                I don't know it seems like this game don't explain anything correctly a lot of the guns don't even match with the stats we didn't have this type of problem in Battlefield 3 
I have a profile picture and a selected avatar but i cant get my profile picture to be public, the only options are close friends
    Oh damn that I have no idea, I've had a custom profile pic but I guess it was never public. I only play with friends so never really noticed. 
        Oh. I'm stupid. You were playing with friends, that's how you can see each other's profile pictures haha.
I figured it out like right after posting lol... The only way people can see your profile picture is if they're close friends with you.

Also, I didn't know there were power ranger profile pictures on the store. Gonna have to cop now

Unfortunately there is no trophy for the full squad on top medals. But we felt fairly accomplished afterwards lol
I hit the share button to upload to Facebook, then copied and pasted it to Reddit. I think you can upload to twitter as well. 
    No, I mean for changing your in-game pictures to the PowerRangers!!!
        They are the "avatars" on PS4. You can edit your profile and get "premium avatars" through the PlayStation store. They cost $0.99 each 
        On pc when I select the option to change my avatar, it takes me to ea.com. Maybe try logging in to that? 
Yeah but that's only for your profile picture, which isn't public; only those who you've revealed your real name to can see your profile picture.

Your avatar is what everyone can see, and cannot be customized. You have to select from a pool of premade avatars.
    Oh ok I guess I never noticed because I always play with friends. 
Yes. For console you can only change your profile picture to anything. Not your avatar picture. Its to protect from people having avatars like nudity, racism in game etc.
    Ahh so like half the avatars on PC lol
Are those later seasons? I'm only talking about Mighty Morphin', lol.
    I guess so man lol
        He was also the black ranger in Dino thunder
            Are these "he"s all the same Tommy actor from the Mighty Morphin? Or is it just some green ranger changing suits?
                Same actor
                    Wow that's nuts. I remember losing my shit when the green ranger showed up, even had the VHS episodes of the introduction of the green ranger. Then he turned into the white ranger and my little head exploded.
            I thought he was talking about the truck Ranger. Fuck
    Yeah, it's the two afterwards, Zeo and Turbo. 

I kept watching for far longer than I should have...
    Mighty morphin had 4 seasons then the storyline remained consistent up untill galaxy. The next season "lightspeed rescue was the first power Rangers series to not be a continuation of the last
        I stopped watching or caring after 2nd grade or so.
    Eh, zeo and turbo were all part of the same story arc anyway. (Called the zordon era)
> [RWD Turbo](http://pictures.topspeed.com/IMG/jpg/200512/2001-mazda-rx7-6.jpg)
    Would love to own one !
        You can only rent the apex seals though.
            That feel when they are finally worn out :(
        rather an FC
    Proper choice.
    It took me 5 hours to realize my typo before I got this joke. Gave me a good laugh though. Thanks for that lol
Ford wasn't putting turbos on rangers back then.  fingers crossed for the new one in 2018
    Turbo diesel rangers in Europe right now zzz
Pretty sure he was also a Dino Ranger at some point, too.  ...I think.  It's been too long for my memory.
