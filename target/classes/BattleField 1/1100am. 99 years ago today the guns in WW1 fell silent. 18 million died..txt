            Really sad that Blueprint for Armageddon isn't going to be free when the next episode comes out 
                Doesn't it only cost s couplr bucks anyway
                    I mean yeah
                        Just paid 10 bucks for episodes 34 to 39 on Rome. Dis gon b gud
                On one hand, yes it sucks, but i have no problems paying for his stuff.  One of the only few i will do that for...  

All of his paid podcasts are *so* worth it
18 million. That makes me want to throw up.
    You should see how many died in WW2.

            Already seen that video at least 10 times because I love it so much. Very powerful and sad but interesting at the same time. 
                I had to go watch it again after your comment then I decided I should share just in case someone hasn't seen it. He has one on nuclear war that was uploaded pretty recently as well. 
                    The graphic presentation, especially that transfer from German Western Front casualties to the Eastern Front, and then specifically for Stalingrad, gave me goosebumps. 
                        The way the soviets kept... on... ticking... it was horrifying. It opened my eyes to the fact that the Germans saw their fight against the soviets as the main fight. It was a fight for survival for both sides. The bloodiest a war can be.
                            I've seen the statistics before but it's hard to really comprehend the scale. Seeing it displayed like this is helpful, and horrifying.
                            There’s always that gut wrenching disgust at the lives lost on Normandy D-day invasion for me because of how well that scene as been adapted to media like Saving Pvt Ryan and Medal of Honor. 

But all those deaths are peanuts compared to Stalingrad. That’s not even innocent civilians either. :-/
                            It just keeps going up...and up....and up.
                            It was a war of extermination. 
                        Makes me wonder what would have happened if they stayed allied .
            [deleted]
                Same here. My mother immigrated from Poland in 1976. My paternal grandfather was a POW after the Soviets took him to fight, he escaped and tried to walk back across the German front. He spent six years as a POW. What I would like to know is how many of those Polish deaths were by Soviets.
                I often think of this ... It is scary .
            Thank you for sharing this. 
            The Eastern Front was literally hell on earth to those who were involved. Germany and its allies suffered a terrible toll against the Soviets. The Soviets bled the most out of all the countries involved in the war. WWII was a terrible nightmare.
            Holy fuck i never realized how devastating WWII was for the soviets. That counter kept going and going. 
                Yeah that was the biggest shock for me too, even with all the projects and research I did in school on the pacific theater.
                    And to be fair. School history never did a good job of talking about the eastern front. I only recall learning about Stalingrad maybe twice throughout junior high and high school. This video is great at creating a picture for how devastation it was for the Soviets. 
                        Post-cold war propaganda and relationships has our society pretty adverse to recognizing the Soviets efforts in the war and how they far surpassed our own. 

We're pretty afraid to display that without them...there was absolutely no chance of saving western europe. 
                            My school barely even spoke about the world wars. History education in England is embarrassing. I can honestly say anything I know about history is because I went out and learnt it myself. Worrying to think about the amount of people that are completely unaware of the scale of the world wars.
            This is one of the best videos ive ever seen. Thank you for sharing it. 
            Damn good share.

Seriously hope someone dubs that into german. That's exactly the type of video that can be shown in history class and we keep lacking good, short and compressible content like that. 

If any history teacher is reading this, do your best to translate this. Never ever seen WW2 being put into a perspective like that before and this adds so much to the horror and story of that war.
            Thanks for this. Never seen this before. The numbers were so staggering I cried. 
            *Holy shit the Russian dead....*
            Thanks for that link. Really interesting stuff!
        A *lot* more than 18mill died in WW2 - but if I remember correctly, due to the population growth between World Wars 1 & 2, a higher percentage of the world's population died in WW1.


Edit: I can't actually find where I remember this from. It might have been a certain year or day during WW1 instead.
            Not even remotely close, 70-80 million died in WW2 compared to 18 million in WW1. Unless the population jumped 6x, that doesn’t make sense. 
                70-80 million is probably the total amount of deaths from ww2, but not soldier related. Could be the difference
                    Even then it doesn't make sense. The world population only increased about 30% during that time period. Meanwhile soldier deaths in WW1 were about 8~ million, and soldier deaths in WW2 were anywhere from 17-25 million. 
                        It was 18 million,  not 8
                            15-18 million is the upper total, including civilians. About 8 million soldiers died, and anywhere from 5-10 million civilians died, mostly in Russia and the Ottoman Empire. 
                WW2 added terror bombing, China, industrial genocide, famine, new technologies, two tyrants, total war, 2 more years, new fronts but none of that should detract from the fact that all wars are horrific
                    Only 2 tyrants?
        Yup... Still upchucking 
        German keiser "OH EIN HUMANITY!"

Adolf Hitler "Hold mein bier"
            Oh one humanity?
                not looking for accuracy just looking for funny simplicity

                    Dummkopf
            Fun fact, Hitler wasn't a big beer drinker. But to appeal to German voters he would often be photographed with a beer stein at his table.
                Not a big beer drinker!? Man, the more I hear about this Hitler bloke, the less i like him.
                    Someone should really stop that guy.
        Or the 80+ million who died due to Communism in the Soviet Union and China.
            Every time someone brings up WW2, people start with the damn Genocide Olympics.
                I had a classmate like that in school. I was taking a class on Operation Barbarossa and my classmate saw me reading Geoffrey Megargee's War of Annihilation. He pushed aside my book and said "If you think that's bad, you should look up what King Leopold did in the Congo."

I don't understand the fetish of trying to out-genocide things. 
                    my dad killed more people than your dad!!
                    Many people try to use it to deflect guilt, or to prove that an enemy is worse than you think. 
                        whataboutism
                            Whataboutism is used as deflection when criticizing someone. 

“Russia has committed numerous civil rights atrocities”

“What about America? You are lynching negroes” 

Is the classic example. 

                Well with how active the soc dem and red black communities are on reddit, it’s kinda helpful to remember how much agony that ideology brought to the world. 
            That’s a much different story considering 90% of those deaths were from famines, and only really the holondor can be DIRECTLY attributed to malice in this situation. 

It’s just disingenuous to compare Hitler to Stalin or maos death toll. Hitler killed 28 million damn soviets in JUST the invasions of the ussr. Just to compare the brutality of both, Hitler killed 6 million polish people in his invasion of Poland in 1939. The soviets in comparison left 350,000 dead. It’s just an entirely different scale of genocide which was enabled. 

I am no communist nor do I have sympathies with the ussr, but I hate how westerners warp this stuff. 
                I didn't attribute it to malice; I attributed it to Communism,  which can be given *direct* attribution for famine. And I, a "Westerner", didn't come up with these numbers. I was pulling from Solzhenitsyn. So I'm not sure your identity politics plays here. And the 80+ million doesn't include WWII deaths.

EDIT: I'm not even sure I get the point your point.
                    Sort of sort. For instance when the great famine hit China, it was caused by failing infrastructure by 25 years of war and natural disasters. Mao implemented policies to relive the famine (killing birds etc) but ended up causing more problems. It’s debatable whether this would have happened with communism or not, and the 1959-1963 famine which killed 40 million wasn’t too different from pre communist famines. 

The ussr was a bit different. They weaponized famine against populations they didn’t like, mostly Ukrainians. When famine and drought hit in 1933, they specifically did not send help to relieve the famine in Ukraine and took their food to punish the Ukrainians. But the overall famine of the era was caused by natural disasters for the most part, it was pretty normal for famine to erupt every decade or two in the region. 
            I get your point, but to imply capitalism doesn't give us similar numbers is crazy
                I just want to play games 
                    Then go play my son, play to hearts content or until you get in trouble. Whichever comes first
                Is it? I think your ignorant of the horrendous conditions instantiated in and by communist states.
                    I️ think you’re probably ignorant of the conditions that Britain imposed on its colonies, forcing India to produce cash crops in times of famine that killed ended up killing millions of people, to give a single example.
                        I thought you were talking about Capitalism, but now you're referencing the terrors of Imperialism... I can't say I follow.

                            WW1 and 2 could both be argued to be capitalistic wars. Germany slid down the path of Nazism due to the economic hardship resulting from a capitalist economy crash. Also cant forget all of the manufacturers and rich war barons, whom profited from both wars and millions of deaths. Also see multiple other wars and injustices done in capitalist countries and you'll realise the system isn't the problem, it's always who leads at the end.
                                Lolwut. Germany didn't fall into economic depression because capitalism, they did so because the Treaty of Versailles fucked them sideways economically and they had no way to pay reparations besides printing money.

And while people made nauseating amounts of money off the world wars, it's more than a bit of a stretch to call them "capitalist wars"
                                    Well Germany didn't lose its economy due to a single reason at that time, the Rhineland was occupied and the reparations were fair but harsh, i agree, but the great depression, which jumpstarted the hyperinflation of Germany, as well as strong state ownership was capitalistic in nature,.
It IS a stretch, because whether Communism or capitalism, the deaths of millions on either side was due to humans, the ability to do evil isn't tied to economical models. This is why i tried to grossly point that out with that argument, I dislike seeing red-scare type of comments used as meme, kills potential discussion.
                                Germany didn’t go to Nazism because of a capitalist crash. The treaty of Versailles put the blame of the war on them even though all of Europe was ready to throw punches at the start of the war. Hell, people were asking to forgive Germany’s supposed dent to Europe because they knew it would eventually lead to another war and guess what happened? Why do you think the US helped offset parts of the cost of the war and rebuilding following the war? 
            And that's nothing compared to how many people have died of Malaria!
            I have no clue why you were downvoted lol
                Because it doesn't compare. People dying "due to communism" is a bullshit statistic in and off itself, but it's especially shitty when compared to people dying in war, i.e killing each other. 
                because this statistic is made up from the debunked black book of communism
                They weren't REAL Communists!!!


/s
                    That's cause real communism isn't possible. No country has ever followed Marx's process to communism, it's just not going to happen. 

                        >  Marx's process to communism

lol you say that like it's some step by step recipe by the chef Karlito Marks
                        And it's not going to, unless humans change fundamentally. Marxs idea of communism is almost too utopian for me. 
                            Why? It’s basically the fundamentalism of lesser human mind. “I need more free stuff, others should give it to me”
                                That's exactly the mindset of a capitalist in Marx's works, well done understanding it.
                                    So basically it’s a literature work of projection, zero responsibility and all control of wealth through the nanny state. It has 0 to do with capitalism and free market in real world though.
                        The kibbutz system in Israel was pretty close.

I agree though. The economy is to complicated to plan, it's best to let it just happen organically
                            economies need intervention, no such thing as an entirely "organic" economy
                Very easy, it doesn't matter to the current story. Gotten pretty annoying on reddit that some people somehow think it's necessary to daily fearmonger about communism as if the proletariat is planning to revolt next tuesday and implement some archaic economic-political system that failed more times than you got finger on your hands. 

Not to mention the whole number is misleading, obviously communism isn't a person cutting millions of peoples throats, nor did eg the soviets ever commit genocide, nor did that many people actually starve, but that's another story that really doesn't belong here.

Or the basic idea that it's fucking retarded to use the remembrance of a tragedy far in the past, on reddit of all places, as some political gunpowder against imaginary opponents. 
                Because no one asked. Think.
                You really don't? Have you seen how many openly communist users reddit has? It's sickening.

Edit: the downvotes prove my point.
                    Don't worry, they will keep growing.

                        Mostly a poor attempt at socialism due to corruption, not communism.
                            Isnt that always the excuse though? Communism doesnt work because your relying on humans who hold power to be fair. 
                                It is a universal excuse for every system. There's no perfect socialism capitalism or communism.  Not one system is better, and none is ever perfectly implemented due to humans. Simply blaming Venezuela's situation to socialism is not looking at the big picture is all I wanted to tell him.
                                    No there isnt a perfect system, but id rather have one where im allowed property and the right to criticize whom id like.
                Because that obviously wasn't real Communism...duh
                    People obviously didn't get it was just a meme

                        Then you can compare the deaths of these individual wars to other wars, e.g WW2, and it would be an appropriate comparison. Counting vague nonsense numbers as "deaths by communism" and putting them against deaths in certain wars is fucking stupid. 
                        And capitalism has caused victims of war all over the Middle East and Central America, but again, this isn’t the time or place. To be clear, communism is a terrible and harmful system, but that doesn’t mean I’m always looking for an opportunity to shit on it. Know your place.

            Big if true
        But at least they died in a war that was necessary. 
        60 million in WWII
            77 million in ww2
                Guess it [depends on the source.](https://www.nationalww2museum.org/students-teachers/student-resources/research-starters/research-starters-worldwide-deaths-world-war) [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties) says 70m to 85m. Jesus.....
                    **World War II casualties**

World War II was the deadliest military conflict in history in absolute terms of total casualties. Over 60 million people were killed, which was about 3% of the 1940 world population (est. 2.3 billion). Statistics of military wounded are available for the major combatants.

        Holy fucking shit, why did I never hear of that? Wikipedia even claims 50-100 mio global, 3-6% of world population.

That's likely worse than WW2. Oo
            And that's why modern governments flip their shit when a possible pandemic arises.  

Presuming a comparable death toll, we could be looking at 400 million dead, with a much higher ceiling given the poverty, population density, and already overtaxed medical services in places like India or China.

It's a testament to mankind's fear of contagion that we stand guard against something no one in living memory has experienced.

Until a few years ago AIDS was killing two million africans every year. I think we got plenty reminder as to how dangerous disease can get.
                    Thats a preventable condition that is not spread due to contact but ignorance and risky behaivor... big difference
                        Yup.  
            Also called the "Spanish Flu."
                Somehow I'm sure the spanish got another name for it :\^)
                    Royal Flu. We are very proud of it.
                        Very progressive.
                    Probably 'Catalan Flu'.
    Fun fact: People were literally drowning in mud at Passchendaele.

They would get stuck from the waist up and people couldn't help them because of the lack of solid footing. You couldn't dig around because the mud was almost like a liquid. You could only leave some of them there, from the waist up, crying for help.
        Doesn't sound that fun...
        Nobody thought to toss them a rope?
            Apparently it didn't work.
            Or a syringe!
        "Fun" fact. 😔
        Two days ago marked the 100 anniversary of the end of the battle of Passchendaele. November 10th, lest we forget.
    Thinking of all the individual horrific ways each person died is just too much 
    Remember that number next time something like 9-11 happens. Terrorism sucks. War is worse.
        Yap. The tragedies of peace time pale in comparision to the daily horror of war.
        But war is profitable... so that's good right?!
            Actual wars really really aren't. War in general is wasted resources by any definition. It is lucrative for certain people to have small conflicts.
                It is incredibly lucrative for certain people...lots of things are "wasted resources" that make certain people lots of money.
                The military industrial complex though
                It depends. WWI and II massively damaged the economies of Britain, France, Germany, Russia etc., whereas America made billions out of them.
    F
    18 million is... a bit overstated. It was more around 10-12 million. 
        Still barf worthy 
BF1 taught me 17 of those 18 million were from the Hellriegel
    And that many could be saved if the medics did their job
        And boy do I love rushing out of cover for the revive, just as they skip and leave me awkwardly shuffling my feet in no mans land.
            I always imagine that feeling is like being a medic, running up to a fallen soldier and realizing there's nothing you can do to help.  The BF version 
                It's more like running up to a fallen soldier that you could easily save, but then he shoots himself 🕺
                    I wonder if that actually happened in the WW's.
        We do our fucking job mate, you lot just can't wait 4 seconds to respawn.
            I'm actually a medic 95% of the time.  Just think there should be more of us.   It's an unstoppable wave when you have 5 medics in a squad 
                Most of my score is just because of this cycle (revive, supres fire, drop med crate, repeat) there have been times I've had mvp in a match with a 9-25 K/D
                    Same I'm normally in the top 3 on my team every match just doing this.
                        I would love a squad of just medics. 5 medics running like a wave of unstoppable death... Untill we run out of ammo at least.
                            And that’s when the support squad comes in! A maelstrom of bullets!
                Not having medics is probably the leading cause of losses in operations, aside from having too many scouts. A well balanced team could probably win a vast majority of operations, regardless of overall skill. 
                    My dream is to have a full team of medics who all heal
                        But who's gonna deal with the tanks that roll up? Then you'd need medics with rifle grenades. 
                            One good assault.
                                And a Support with Ammo pouches to quickly resupply the Assault.
 
And one scout with spotting flares, the support should also resupply this scout so that he keeps the enemies lighted up.  
  
Now that's a dream team.
                                    Yeah. There should be one of everything with ptfo loadouts and the rest medics. I don't understand why people don't abuse the hell out of the medic class. You've got Jesus' best superpowers ffs
        My tag in BF1 is medics die first. I’m assault class
    One can only speculate.
        S
    And every single person was using submachine guns.
    Gonna play the cheeses dickhead but this post isn’t really for Hellriegel memes.
    Yep. Especially on PS4 since EVERY ASSAULT USES IT. But when a medic saves me I rejoice!
In all seriousness what a horrendous time it must have been to be alive. We are lucky.
    Want to know what the scary thing is? The 20th century was more peaceful than the 19th century, and centuries preceding it.

If the world seems violent today, it is only because our news media lacks perspective. Truthfully, we are living in a practical golden age of peace. We really are lucky.
        The second half of the 20th century is also called the "long peace" because none of the major economic and military powers fought one another since WW2, albeit they fought proxy wars against poorer less developed nations. And even the deaths in all post WW2 conflicts don't come close to the amount that died between 1939 and 1945. Look at the top of the comments for a great video about the deaths in WW2 and after.

            What happens when we run out of poor nations to proxy with?
                We'll fight proxy wars within another country. 
                Cold wars in cyberspace.
        Yupp, WW1 was mostly something that truly remained in the modern, western memory and left marks. Otherwise it was more or less a direct continuation of conflicts like the napoleonic wars.
            You’re right it is pretty much considered the ‘first war’ of modern times 
                And I was just checking back, but holy shit, while the napoleonic wars caused ~6 million deaths, the thirty years war caused ~8 millions deaths almost 200 years earlier.

The latter one being with a much lower population density and mostly limited to the holy roman empire's grounds. That's fucking terrifying. Oo
                    Record keeping from these days is ALWAYS suspect dude.
                        Of course it is, and historians know that too. And there is a consensus that parts of germany were depopulated by those conflicts, so those numbers might not be so unrealistic.
                            Not all historians are truth seeking people.
                                That's why you check on the consensus.
                                    That's why a consensus means nothing apart from its majority design. Majority's are often wrong or ineffective and detailing the truth about poorly kept data.
                    while i can't rember the exact numbers i know the thirty years war killed a higher percentage of the worlds population. with only melee weapons and very early guns too. 
                To be fair, that's why this game was called "Battlefield One" in the first place
        i’ve heard 20th was most violent century
            During the 17th century century's 30 years war roughly 1/3rd the population of central europe died, in some places as much as 2/3rds was killed. By comparison WWII killed only about 3-4% of the world's population.
                there were about 200,000,000 deaths in 20th century from war and famine. there were about 3 billion people at the time in 1950 alone, so that is an upwards of 8% of the world population killed. 

                    However by the end of the 20th century the population was 6 billion, so the % drops dramatically if you consider the whole century's deaths vs the population. However measuring deaths over such a time period can be inaccurate.

But, even going on your numbers. The Taiping Rebellion for instance has a death toll estimated to be up to 100,000,000 (though the real number is likely much lower) which represented at the very least 10% of the world's 1 billion population. All that from a single conflict. The Spanish/Portuguese Conquest of South America in the 16th century was even deadlier and likely the single most destructive event in human history. 
                        [here’s something i found out of curiosity, the death % for population was greatest in 20th century](https://imgur.com/gallery/kfzdj) 
                            I'm sorry but whatever source that came from is pure bullshit, and looks kind of euro-centric. More people died in China in the 19th century than that list claims died in the whole world. The death toll in the Americas in the 16th century was likely over 100 million at the least and it claims only 1-2 million died. Even the death toll in just Europe during the 17th century exceeds what this list claims.
                                And many records from hundreds of years ago are bullshit too man. You have no actual way of verifying any of it.
        > Truthfully, we are living in a practical golden age of peace. We really are lucky.

Until it ends, of course. 
    I'm in my early twenties (born in the mid 90s) and I just imagine if I was born ***exactly 100 years ago***, I probably would be fighting in the trenches, scrambling to put my gas mask on, avoiding artillery fire, trying not to get sniped, etc etc...

**Just some crazy thoughts**
        You and me both man, would have been 20 in 1914 if I were born 100 years ago, ripe age to get shipped out to WWI
    Yep, it wasn't so long ago either. Born a hundred years earlier and that would be us dying. Crazy.
        Yeah right I was born 100 years and six months after a certain Adolf Hitler
            ...Hitler fought in WW1.
            Which one?
            ?

If you were born in 1889 you would have been in WWI, and probably died.
    99 years ago today my family was taking my great great grandma to be buried. My grandmother was not quite two years old, and remembers riding in to Dauphin Manitoba in the sleigh with her grandma's body, hearing all the church bells ringing and guns being fired as people celebrated the end of the war.
    And then people still want to call the French cowards. Look at Verdun and tell me they’re cowards.
That is also independence day in my country. After 123 years Poland came back to life. Never forget the losses. 

F

Edit. Only to get 16% of it's population killed in next war.
    "World War II casualties of Poland. Approximately six million Polish citizens perished during World War II: about one fifth of the pre-war population. Most were civilian victims of the war crimes and crimes against humanity during the occupation by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union."

Edit - hashtags - i mean exclamation marks of course ^^


[This guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Gunther) was killed at 10:59, one minute before the cease fire.

Bad luck mate.
    To.be fair, he was an idiot
        Yeah. It seems like one of those things where he didn't want to go home in disgrace, and the higher ups kinda just let it slide. He definitely didn't deserve the post-humous promotion, but it was one of those feel good things to help the country heal.
            I'm wondering if it was suicide?

It had to be.  PTSD mixed with depression
                That's basically what it sounds like. Like suicide by cop, but with machine guns. It was Americans that told the story too, and even they said the Germans were trying to wave him off. As with most tragedies in war though, we will never know the full story.
    They literally fought up to the last minute
    **Henry Gunther**

Henry Nicholas John Gunther (June 6, 1895 – November 11, 1918) was an American soldier and the last soldier of any of the belligerents to be killed during World War I. He was killed at 10:59 a.m., one minute before the Armistice was to take effect at 11 a.m.

    a lot of people were killed after the official cease fire
In Flanders fields the poppies blow
    Between the crosses, row on row,
  That mark our place; and in the sky
  The larks, still bravely singing, fly
Scarce heard amid the guns below.

We are the Dead.   Short days ago
We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,
  Loved and were loved, and now we lie
      In Flanders fields.

Take up our quarrel with the foe:
To you from failing hands we throw
  The torch; be yours to hold it high.
  If ye break faith with us who die
We shall not sleep, though poppies grow
      In Flanders fields.
    What passing-bells for these who die as cattle? 
Only the monstrous anger of the guns. 
Only the stuttering rifles' rapid rattle 
Can patter out their hasty orisons.

No mockeries now for them; no prayers nor bells; 
Nor any voice of mourning save the choirs, –
The shrill, demented choirs of wailing shells; 
And bugles calling for them from sad shires.
What candles may be held to speed them all? 
Not in the hands of boys but in their eyes 
Shall shine the holy glimmers of goodbyes. 
The pallor of girls' brows shall be their pall; 
Their flowers the tenderness of patient minds, 
And each slow dusk a drawing-down of blinds.

Anthem for doomed youth- Wilfred Owen
        Bent double, like old beggars under sacks, 

Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge, 

Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs, 

And towards our distant rest began to trudge. 

Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots, 

But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind; 

Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots 

Of gas-shells dropping softly behind. 


Gas! GAS! Quick, boys!—An ecstasy of fumbling 

Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time, 

But someone still was yelling out and stumbling 

And flound’ring like a man in fire or lime.—

Dim through the misty panes and thick green light, 

As under a green sea, I saw him drowning. 


In all my dreams before my helpless sight, 

He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning. 


If in some smothering dreams, you too could pace 

Behind the wagon that we flung him in, 

And watch the white eyes writhing in his face, 

His hanging face, like a devil’s sick of sin; 

If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood 

Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,

Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud 

Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,—

My friend, you would not tell with such high zest 

To children ardent for some desperate glory, 

The old Lie: Dulce et decorum est 

Pro patria mori.

*Dulce et Decorum Est*

*Wilfred OWEN*
            Holy shit. I can just picture the guy panicking to get his mask on, unable to do so as the gas envelops him...burning out his eyes, choking on his own lungs as they essentially dissolved inside him...

This is why gas was banned from all future wars after WWI. It was far too horrible a way to die.
                It was banned pre-ww1, including things such as Tear Gas, but none of the major European powers gave a shit. France were the first nation to use any form of gas warfare in WW1, prompting the Germans into developing something worse than Tear Gas.

Thus, modern biological warfare was born. 
        The sad thing is, Wilfred Owen died during the war, a week before the armistice.
    had to do analysis for this poem a few times going through school (Canadian), and I hated it at the time. but it's such a moving piece, I wish I would have taken it more seriously then

Also, Poland reached indepedence.
    I was just telling a friend the other day that next November is Poland's centennial. 
        December 6th this year for Finland. 
            Too bad it doesn't exist
        Not really. It is going to be a centennial of Polish independence after the partitions, not Poland in general.
Every year around this time, I listen to Dan Carlin's WWI podcast. If you haven't done so, it's incredible. 
    It's a fantastic podcast.

I've listened to "Blueprint for Armageddon" 3 times now 
        So good! They're all good. 
            I just wish he had more on iTunes 
    I've been thinking of getting into listening to some podcasts but I don't really much about them, what does this one talk about? 
        WW1 and with stories and quotes from all political sides. Also the brutality and goodness in all humans. The best narration I've listened to. 
        He also has other historical periods and stories. One on Ghengis Khan is incredible too. 
        Radiolab is another great podcast. It’s not about ww1 . But they cover a lot of different topics. A personal favorite of mine is called “the buried bodies case”.
        Dan Carlin's Hardcore History pods are really good (also really, really long) basically narrations of a certain event, or set of events, or war. In depth, dramatic.

Not sure if they would be the first pod I'd recommend to someone (although was basically the first I've listened to. Started with his Prophets of Doom episode, FWIW).

Gotten really in to a lot of podcasts since then (about a year and a half ago), however. Got plenty of recommendations, depending what you are in to.
    I listened to it once last year and I don't know if I could do it again (length of the thing notwithstanding). It really set something off in me, made me realize what the human cost of wars really mean. I began to imagine if I had been in a trench, or more importantly the fact that there were 18 million "me"s in those trenches (that is to say, real people with hopes and dreams and little quirks)  who all died for what was essentially no fucking reason. And that all 18 million of them and all 70-odd million casualties of World War 2 were real people with their own lives and not numbers on a page like I always saw them to be. 

But yeah, really good podcast. Would recommend.
        WW2 numbers are inflated.
I'm in my early twenties (born in the mid 90s) and I just imagine if I was born ***exactly 100 years ago***, I probably would be fighting in the trenches, scrambling to put my gas mask on, avoiding artillery fire, trying not to get sniped, etc etc...

**Just some crazy thoughts**
    I bet most of us would be injured or killed right now of it was 100 years ago
Thought someone would link the Blackadder ending.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vH3-Gt7mgyM
    That ending always makes me sad,  I think it's because it's such a funny light show with such a realistic ending
        I agree, this is exactly what makes the ending so utterly devastating. I hope they never reprise the roles in another series, the finality and total silence that has followed since we watched the characters go "over the top" is a poignant reminder of the human tragedy of the sacrifice made during the Great War. 
        The amazing thing about it is that they screwed it up when they filmed it, so they had to create a new ending in post-production:

“... We had suddenly learned to see. And we saw that there was nothing of their world left. We were all at once terribly alone; and alone we must see it through.”

Oh how do you do, young Willy Mc bride 
    Do you mind if I sit here, down by you're graveside
        never fails to make me teary eyed, have you heard the high kings cover from memory lane? my personal favorite. 

in that faithful heart are you forever 19
            No I haven't yet, I'll check it out
                such a senseless war 
    I’m too drunk for this tonight, thanks for cutting the onions dick!
The sun’s shining down on these green fields of France, the warm wind blows gently and the red poppies dance, the trenches have vanished long under the plow, no gas no barbed wire no guns firing now. But here in this graveyard that’s still no man’s land, the countless white crosses in mute witness stand to man’s blind indifference to his fellow man, and a whole generation that was butchered and damned. 
    "Well how do you do young billy? I cried

Do you mind if I sit here by your graveside and rest for a while, I've been walking all day and I'm nearly done.

I see by your gravestone you were only 19 when you joined the great fallen in 1916.

I hope you died well and I hope you died clean,  or young Billy McBride was it slow and unseen?

Did they beat the drums slowly?"
How many wars in the modern times have the people had any voice if the war is needed or not? How many times have the people lied upon on what has happened - and thus; why we must fight and kill each other?

The thing that we all should remember is best put in a form of a quote.

#*When the rich wage war, it's the poor who die.*
-Jean-Paul Sartre


Here in Sweden we are shocked when 2 people die in Afganistan, not anything wrong about that but imagine losing hundreds of thousand people...
    Millions*

France lost a hundred thousand in 1 week at Verdun
        Did they though? The record keeping from this age is not very good. Russia likes to say they lost like 30m plus in WW2 but no one actually believes that.
            France had better record keeping in WW1 then Russia in WW2.

We had proper military documents and service lists we can read and study.

Russia just finished its red purge and was not organized during ww2
                Every government including France will resort to propaganda to make themselves look better. Sure, I am not saying they were as bad as Russia lol. I just don't get remembrance days based on numbers alone. It comes off as cheesy to me. 

Definitely with WW2 in that those numbers are purely ridiculous on some levels. For Jews, Germans, and Russians. I don't believe any of the final numbers. Russia's are off the charts bullshit.

Still incredibly high mind you, more than anything else. It's just a pity everyone feels the need to lie about it.
I remember I bought bf1 on remembrance day last year. Seeing the intro, where it talks about 'The War to End All Wars'...Hit me right in the feels when I read the part that says "It ended nothing." 

The campaign really triggered my eye watering allergies

They nailed this game. 
What passing-bells for these who die as cattle? 

      — Only the monstrous anger of the guns. 

      Only the stuttering rifles' rapid rattle 

Can patter out their hasty orisons. 

No mockeries now for them; no prayers nor bells; 

      Nor any voice of mourning save the choirs,— 

The shrill, demented choirs of wailing shells; 

      And bugles calling for them from sad shires. 

What candles may be held to speed them all? 

      Not in the hands of boys, but in their eyes 

Shall shine the holy glimmers of goodbyes. 

      The pallor of girls' brows shall be their pall; 

Their flowers the tenderness of patient minds, 

And each slow dusk a drawing-down of blinds.

-Anthem for doomed youth, Wilfred Owen

Wilfred Owen died later in the war, one week, to the hour, before the signing of the armistice.
And sadly, many have chosen to forget some of the most important events in our history
To anyone that hasn't seen it, now is a great time to go watch The Great War on YouTube. It ends today. It started four years ago, exactly 100 years after the war began. It's a week-by-week recap of the progress of the war and it is phenomenal.
    Yes for the series but we still have one more year to go mate.
We will remember them. 
was that greenwich mean time or....
    Haha, I'm picturing them not clarifying this and one side stopping the war before the other.

If there was a like button on Reddit, I would click the like bottom billions of times. 18 million is honestly disgusting.  Love goes out to any veterans still out there. 
    Not of WW1...  lol
        There are some still world war 1 vets 
            No there isn't.   They'd be over 118 years old by now
                Your right the guy I was thinking of passed in 2012 
100 years next year? I hope they suggest it as a global holiday
    It already is in most places.

USA, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, France, Poland, Russia, Turkey and probably a couple more.


        Next year or in general? I mean like a full on "no work" national holiday
            Yes, paid day off.

In general, every year
                That’s fantastic! I’ve never heard of a single employer here in the UK doing that, and I have worked or have friends in a whole ton of professions
                    I thought it was, my wife is from the UK and she said November 11 is for Remembrance Day so I assumed it would be a bank holiday like Canada
                        No bank holiday, I  still work but we have silence at 11:00 for 5 minutes 
                            That's lame, canada gives us a full day off paid
                                We observed 100% silence for two minutes and I work in a call centre with 1000 other people. I was proud of my guys.
After trying the new COD, all I could think about was playing Battlefield 1 again. WW2 feels like an underfunded extremely early version of Battlefield 1. Battlefield 1 is the best multiplayer shooter around right now. 
    Yeah I was really excited for COD.  

It sucks compared to BF1
        I'm still surprised people compare Bf and COD. They use two completely different styles. COD is an arcade shooter while Bf is a, well open battlefield shooter that has all sorts of vehicles.
            Honestly they are both great, and i love ww2. Its like when people compare CSGO and R6.
            The comparison is how much fun I have playing them both. And I don't have fun playing cod, but I do playing battlefield. There for, for me at least, battlefield is better than cod. 
        COD gonna COD.

They found a model that was profitable and they will never, ever change it. 
            Cod... Cod never changes...
        I've heard good things about the campaign, though.  Have you tried that?
            I heard the first thing that happens is you get off the boat in Normandy to PPSH fire from the Germans who have a mix of SS and Wehrmacht uniforms.
                So, I'm not too familiar with the details, but the PPSH was a Soviet gun, and you're saying there shouldn't be any SS uniforms, right?  Basically, you're criticizing the historical accuracy.
                    Correct, and they shied away from displaying the swastika and used the iron cross instead.
                        Lack of swastikas was in multiplayer only, I believe, which is understandable.  The campaign has them, as far as I know.
    Obviously somebody had to turn this thread into a shit on COD thing. This is about taking a moment to reflect on all the people that gave their lives in WW1 and you've gotta taint it with this nonsense? 
        Because I love battlefield 1. 
    Of course this subreddit finds a way to turn a memorial post into some anti-cod circlejerking shit...

Are you guys really any better than /r/WWII
        The salt in unnecessary. 
    100% agree. My friends shit on me for getting season pass (only paid $26 anyways) and playing it as much as I️ do. Had like 4 buddies ask if I️ was getting WW2 and were so taken back by me saying no. Why would I️ spend money on another CoD that is just going to take me back to the days of rage quitting and breaking controllers? CoD was amazing back in the day and it was my second love after Halo 2, but with BF1 running the way it is with the content that it has and it’s historical appeal, it blows it out of the water. 
The way this title reads it implies that 18 million died after the guns went silent.



    You're right poor sentence structure on my part, sorry
        it made me laugh lol
    Well actually, after the war the Spanish Flu epidemic kicked off killing around 50 million worldwide.
Thank you everyone for your respect.  I'm always impressed with the Battlefield community here.
It's hard to take part to be honest, you look at the media and consecutive governments around the West and elsewhere, people still  think nothing of going to war. We idolise/worship members of the military and there seems to be a a growing fetish of accusing someone of not being patriotic enough.

They said sending 18 million young men to go die for no reason was something that should never happen again, and then it happened again and was even worse. I suppose the only thing that's changed is now nobody is forced to go fighting (at least in most of the West) so the military brass and military charities have no moral objection to being so pro war, and the civilian populace doesn't care because they're not being forced to take part.

Living in the UK it just feels very hard to think that Remembrance Day hasn't turned into a patriotic pro-war day of drivel. The same guys that harp on about military pride and "lest we forget" are the same guys who beat the drums of war the hardest. And whether people like to admit it or not a large part of that mentality stems from the Armed Forces itself.
    War is fucking stupid, but if you think WW2 was a no reason war, then so are you.
        WW2 happened because of WW1 being such a pointless clusterfuck of just pure utter human stupidity. 
            Before the Armistice 99 years ago, parties on all sides knew round two was coming soon. It only took 21 years.  
            Dammit Europe
        He didn't say anything about WW2

EDIT: I did a derp
            >sending 18 million young men to go die for no reason was something that should never happen again, and then it happened again and was even worse

That pretty much means WW2
                Oh, good point.
    > there seems to be a a growing fetish of accusing someone of not being patriotic enough.

A growing fetish?

Dude it was so bad in WWI that british women started a campaign to shame any man who hadn't enlisted into doing so by giving them a white flower. 
        Is white flower a metaphor for something? Or a literal white flower?
            Read back up, it was a white feather. White feathers have traditionally been symbolic of cowardice (or peace, if being used as an anti-war slogan)
                Oh i see. Thats messed up
                    Oh it's worse than that. Not only were people getting publicly shamed into enlisting, even soldiers on leave and discharged veterans were getting harassed.
                        Male privilege tho, amirite
                        Damn that sucks. Was it like that in america?
    Your line "nobody is forced to go fighting (at least in most of the West) " reminds me of a question that snuck into my brain recently, at least with regard to US military service.

If college and healthcare were universal and free in the US, what would that do to military enlistment? 

EDIT: Forgot a word.
        People would still join to fight for their country or to get out of their hometown. 
            That's not the point. The point is how many fewer people would enlist. 
                The majority of Veterans I know joined for economic reasons: GI bill, training, lack of opportunities in a small rural town.

The rest joined because of family tradition, except that one fucktard that just wanted to kill people.
                    I know one in high school who joined just to kill. 
                        I know a few from my high school who said the same. I guess they think its gonna all play out like a game of call of duty or something. 
                            Ya it’s just fucking crazy man. 
                            If you get a chance to talk to someone that's combat arms in the Army, it's a fairly common mindset. We know it's not like CoD, but our job is to take ground and kill the enemy, and we embrace it.
                                Thats one thing. Its another thing to be a kid in high school who hasnt even had a taste of this combat and say they already love it. What about when they’re on the receiving end of the ass kicking?
                                    Oh yeah, there's a huge difference. Those kids that talk big usually go for a desk job and act all badass. Or cooks lol
                    I saw a reddit post earlier for a certain US military branch, where well over half the enlisted personnel did it for economic reasons. Its fucked, you shouldn't have to hold a rifle and go to a foreign land to fight a war to get university education and health care. 
        The poor fight for the rich. And it has always been this way... 
            They destroy and they also build for the rich
        Depends on branch and MOS
    How old are you? Curious. Teens, 20s? 

If you ever take the time out of your day to go to a remembrance ceremony, you will find families there who have lost people at war. Go and say that to them and see how far you get.

I lost an Uncle in the Falklands and the knock on effect on the family tore it apart for over 20 years. He enlisted because there simply weren't any other jobs out there which had some manner of career progression. He was on the RFA Sir Galahad. 

He enlisted in the 70s during the 3 day week, where Britain was in a complete mess. Look that up if you are too young to remember it, which I assume you are. 

Many enlist because it just happens to be the trade of the family. Like they aren't born to do anything else. 

It's not about Patriotism, it's about acknowledging an inevitable sacrifice that is made to maintain some form of order in a world constantly on the ropes. 

New Wave Liberalism has created this disgusting notion that people should be ashamed for serving their country. If we ever have forced conscription again, I look forward to seeing the attitudes change of all these millennials who should spend more time studying history and less time on Instagram.


        Why do people get so mad over millennials? People seem to think it's fine to throw blanket statements everywhere that fits their mindset.
            Millennials is just a cover for "the young generation is bad".

It's like the people using it know how retarded and senile that idea is, because the elders also said it about their made up generation, but now they try really hard to justify doing the same, while destracting with giving that generation  a specific name.
            Because its rare I’ve spoken with one who’s opinions aren’t shaped by social media & pop culture rather than actual real life experience.
                It's rare that I've spoken to an older generation that isn't influenced by social media either. That doesn't mean that entire generation is bad.
                    Of course not. Not saying the whole generation is "bad". 
        You seem to have misunderstood his comment. 
            Sorry, I don't agree. 

People who have never been to any form of Remembrance Day ceremony to get a real idea of what it's about. To speak with the families and people there. It's not a celebration of war in the slightest. It's the exact opposite of that but focuses on why some of these wars were unavoidable.

It's very different to the portrayal you get on social media where the Poppy and Union Jack are being used to push a right wing agenda. 

I hear this same sentiment from people all the time. Usually from people in their early 20s or younger. Many can even hold a straight face and make out that WWI / WWII could have been avoided from a British perspective, which just isn't true. 




                > It's not a celebration of war in the slightest.

I attended my town's Remembrance Day ceremony today. The speaker asked us to remember and celebrate all past, present, and future military members and all they have done. I support the holiday, and will continue to do so. Sayings it's not a celebration is wrong though. 

We remember those that fell (or will in the future) while also celebrating the country's goals and achievements won.
                He's not talking about Remembrance Day ceremonies though. You've misread his entire comment and become offended over nothing.  
                    I'm not offended. And yes he is talking about Remembrance Day.

 I think it's you that seems to be a bit confused here. 

"Living in the UK it just feels very hard to think that Remembrance Day hasn't turned into a patriotic pro-war day of drivel."

Why I mentioned the ceremonies which show you what it's actually about, far more than social media / pop culture will. 

                        He clearly wasn't talking about ceremonies.

Turn on the news and you get a better picture.
                        Yes but the ceremonies are not the only part of the day, he's very clearly talking about the more modern aspects of Remembrance Day. Not just the ceremonies. 

Remembrance Day ceremonies have always been very tasteful and somber events that highlight the horrors of war. What op is talking about though is the corporate and political highjacking of days like today. Very clear difference. 
                        War is stupid and most of them volunteered to go there. So whatever happened after that, it's on them. This is not a video game, you sign up for the possibility of DYING in DAY ONE. There's no jobs about? Well fucking move somewhere else then.
                            Some people are born warriors and soldiers. Doesn't mean it's not on them, but doesn't mean their deaths don't mean anything. No need to disrespect just because you don't agree.
                                in the grand scheme of things, let's just say that the Vietnam war deaths don't mean absolutely anything. 
        the point 










your head
        I think you're generalizing just a tad there, son. 
        No I agree with this ...

It's sometimes if the world I live in , no one cares about all the sacrifices that happened ... The world isn't a perfect place , and to think that what we have today isn't because millions died .. 

I don't know what to say to those people . Wish the world didn't have a need for conflict and war :/

            >If a WW3 ever happens,...

You say that as if we aren't currently teetering on the edge of it...
    That idealization/worship you describe (at least in America) stems from a sort of social guilt that developed after Vietnam.





In general the treatment of veterans was god awful after the Vietnam war. What was anger at the government was directed at returning veterans, who were facing a myriad of mental conditions, because we had already moved on politically from Vietnam and there was still a lot of anger.







So as a result of this many Americans started to revere veterans as idols.



And honestly I don’t think that’s bad, it’s not up to the soldier to decide if we go to war. It is rather the duty of the civilian to elect responsible representatives, who choose war with consideration to its horrific cost. To attack the praise we give our veterans as fetishizing war, is wholly misguided and shifts blame for war.





But that’s my 2¢
    So true. Look at how many USMC fanbois there are.

    You are dumb as fuck.

Go get some historical context.
        Their comment rings true with a lot of public sentiment in the Commonwealth after the First World War. People went in cheering for war and came out broken. 

The shift in ideas, art, politics, etc., was huge. PM Chamberlain lived through the First World War and knew how horrible it was, affecting his own politics. Why do you think Britain and France were so willing to let Nazi Germany get away with a lot of shit early on? They knew what total war in that age would bring. 

You should get some historical context yourself.
    As someone else in the UK I think it just stems from the influence of America, but also actually its just these opinions are louder.
    Most of the people I see heavily supporting the military or police aren’t for war at all, they’re just willing to put down their lives for me and you if necessary.  After seeing world war 1, 2, Vietnam, and newer conflicts, no one who actually fought or have seen how they fought would want war.  The only people that do are those on top who sit in safety, and the small minority of the mentally unstable

F but what does LEST mean
    "If by any chance/In case" with the intention of avoiding that to happen, more or less.
    It’s a weird one but it’s basically ‘in case we forget’, so the poppy is a reminder of what happened, so that we don’t forget
    It basically means in the full poem that; our soldiers sacrifices are not in vain unless we forget and become destined to repeat the slaughter

                    Have you considered it's not trolling, per se? Obviously, I'm trolling you right here and now, but at the same time, all the lurkers that wouldn't have said anything did, in fact, pay respects. Not to mention, the top comment is about how absurd and terrible the death toll really is. 

So yeah. You can say the thread is shit, and that's your opinion, but it isn't. It still serves the same purpose, which is to remind us of what was supposed to be the war to end all wars, but only marks the beginning of an exceptionally bloody period in history, and a race for power fueled by military expansion: the end, and beginning, of an era. 

So, tl:dr, just because people don't pour their hearts out doesn't mean they don't get it. 
            I think it's great,

             Don't sweat it. 
I tend to believe all major war numbers for the dead are over estimated in these places. I wonder what the number really is without each country fighting to say they lost the most. We know Russia is guilty of this in WW2.
    Well 18 million is the number studied and given by historians not by governments.
Sorry I’m American can anyone tell what the F is about?
    In one of the call of dutys (advanced warfare?) There's a funeral scene where the game prompts you to press f to pay respects

looks like dice have forgotten a major day in the war (its end). this should have been a major event weekend for them. i dont get how they got it so wrong. 

    I know it’s a game set in WWI but maybe a bit too insensitive to do something in game to mark this. 
        very least they could do a dog tag marking the day. just sumthing to mark it. they could have done a message as you logged on like they do for lots of things. but to do nothing just seems so wrong. 

            Yeah that would have been decent. 
        Have the game display a poppy on 11/11/18 for a whole day

That's GMT?
A historic day indeed.
Screw all of you in the comments typing F. It's fucking disrespectful.
    Why?

They're all paying respect in their own way
        If your friends or family members died and you decided to make a post on the internet would you want people to type F? It's a meme - typing F is making a mockery of a terrible event that wiped out almost an entire generation of young men, not including civilian deaths.
            I served in the military for 3 years, even served with a guy who was killed in Afghanistan.   My great  uncle was killed at the Somme.

I'd rather them have them take 2 seconds out of their day to pay respects in their own way.   If gamers want to press f then I'll thank them for it.  Going to the Ceremony and laying a poppy isn't for everyone.
            This is a video gaming subreddit on the internet, not your local cenotaph.
            Yes because we experienced this and we are responsible for the war. I don't believe those inflated numbers anyway.
                You need to do some reading then. 
    TIL paying respects is disrespectful. And I thought everyone was joking when they said people get offended from anything.

Because their medics forgot how to medic.

On a serious note: F
TIL 18 million people died the instant WW1 ended. 
    Yes the phrasing is confusing, but that is the overall casualties of the war
Yeah, never forget...Now, who wants to do Conquest on Tsaritsyn? 
    Fuck that map, literally one of the worst BF1 maps imo
        It's my favourite actually 
            Why tho?? It’s so poorly designed. All the action is focused on B, which is a two-level corner/balcony camp-fest clusterfuck. Basically all you need to win is to hold that flag and either A or C and you’ve won. Hell, I’ve won just by holding the B flag and out killing the other team. 
                Because it's always a slaughter for the attacking side.   It's futile going after B.

It makes me think that's a real taste of WW1.   Doomed attacks that do nothing, a slaughter and wasted lives for nothing taken.    When you view it like that and that you won't win it's a fun experience.
F
F
And the ideologies that drove WWI and WWII are still alive and kicking today. It's horrifying that people can still cling to nationalism despite all the suffering it's caused. 
> 99 years ago today the guns in WW1 fell silent. 18 million died.

Title makes it sound like silencing the guns caused 18 million deaths.

        Already seen that video at least 10 times because I love it so much. Very powerful and sad but interesting at the same time. 
            I had to go watch it again after your comment then I decided I should share just in case someone hasn't seen it. He has one on nuclear war that was uploaded pretty recently as well. 
                The graphic presentation, especially that transfer from German Western Front casualties to the Eastern Front, and then specifically for Stalingrad, gave me goosebumps. 
                    The way the soviets kept... on... ticking... it was horrifying. It opened my eyes to the fact that the Germans saw their fight against the soviets as the main fight. It was a fight for survival for both sides. The bloodiest a war can be.
                        I've seen the statistics before but it's hard to really comprehend the scale. Seeing it displayed like this is helpful, and horrifying.
                        There’s always that gut wrenching disgust at the lives lost on Normandy D-day invasion for me because of how well that scene as been adapted to media like Saving Pvt Ryan and Medal of Honor. 

But all those deaths are peanuts compared to Stalingrad. That’s not even innocent civilians either. :-/
                        It just keeps going up...and up....and up.
                        It was a war of extermination. 
                    Makes me wonder what would have happened if they stayed allied .
        [deleted]
            Same here. My mother immigrated from Poland in 1976. My paternal grandfather was a POW after the Soviets took him to fight, he escaped and tried to walk back across the German front. He spent six years as a POW. What I would like to know is how many of those Polish deaths were by Soviets.
            I often think of this ... It is scary .
        Thank you for sharing this. 
        The Eastern Front was literally hell on earth to those who were involved. Germany and its allies suffered a terrible toll against the Soviets. The Soviets bled the most out of all the countries involved in the war. WWII was a terrible nightmare.
        Holy fuck i never realized how devastating WWII was for the soviets. That counter kept going and going. 
            Yeah that was the biggest shock for me too, even with all the projects and research I did in school on the pacific theater.
                And to be fair. School history never did a good job of talking about the eastern front. I only recall learning about Stalingrad maybe twice throughout junior high and high school. This video is great at creating a picture for how devastation it was for the Soviets. 
                    Post-cold war propaganda and relationships has our society pretty adverse to recognizing the Soviets efforts in the war and how they far surpassed our own. 

We're pretty afraid to display that without them...there was absolutely no chance of saving western europe. 
                        My school barely even spoke about the world wars. History education in England is embarrassing. I can honestly say anything I know about history is because I went out and learnt it myself. Worrying to think about the amount of people that are completely unaware of the scale of the world wars.
        This is one of the best videos ive ever seen. Thank you for sharing it. 
        Damn good share.

Seriously hope someone dubs that into german. That's exactly the type of video that can be shown in history class and we keep lacking good, short and compressible content like that. 

If any history teacher is reading this, do your best to translate this. Never ever seen WW2 being put into a perspective like that before and this adds so much to the horror and story of that war.
        Thanks for this. Never seen this before. The numbers were so staggering I cried. 
        *Holy shit the Russian dead....*
        Thanks for that link. Really interesting stuff!
    A *lot* more than 18mill died in WW2 - but if I remember correctly, due to the population growth between World Wars 1 & 2, a higher percentage of the world's population died in WW1.


Edit: I can't actually find where I remember this from. It might have been a certain year or day during WW1 instead.
        Not even remotely close, 70-80 million died in WW2 compared to 18 million in WW1. Unless the population jumped 6x, that doesn’t make sense. 
            70-80 million is probably the total amount of deaths from ww2, but not soldier related. Could be the difference
                Even then it doesn't make sense. The world population only increased about 30% during that time period. Meanwhile soldier deaths in WW1 were about 8~ million, and soldier deaths in WW2 were anywhere from 17-25 million. 
                    It was 18 million,  not 8
                        15-18 million is the upper total, including civilians. About 8 million soldiers died, and anywhere from 5-10 million civilians died, mostly in Russia and the Ottoman Empire. 
            WW2 added terror bombing, China, industrial genocide, famine, new technologies, two tyrants, total war, 2 more years, new fronts but none of that should detract from the fact that all wars are horrific
                Only 2 tyrants?
    Yup... Still upchucking

        Fun fact, Hitler wasn't a big beer drinker. But to appeal to German voters he would often be photographed with a beer stein at his table.
            Not a big beer drinker!? Man, the more I hear about this Hitler bloke, the less i like him.
                Someone should really stop that guy.
    Or the 80+ million who died due to Communism in the Soviet Union and China.
        Every time someone brings up WW2, people start with the damn Genocide Olympics.
            I had a classmate like that in school. I was taking a class on Operation Barbarossa and my classmate saw me reading Geoffrey Megargee's War of Annihilation. He pushed aside my book and said "If you think that's bad, you should look up what King Leopold did in the Congo."

I don't understand the fetish of trying to out-genocide things. 
                my dad killed more people than your dad!!
                Many people try to use it to deflect guilt, or to prove that an enemy is worse than you think. 
                    whataboutism
                        Whataboutism is used as deflection when criticizing someone. 

“Russia has committed numerous civil rights atrocities”

“What about America? You are lynching negroes” 

Is the classic example. 

            Well with how active the soc dem and red black communities are on reddit, it’s kinda helpful to remember how much agony that ideology brought to the world. 
        That’s a much different story considering 90% of those deaths were from famines, and only really the holondor can be DIRECTLY attributed to malice in this situation. 

It’s just disingenuous to compare Hitler to Stalin or maos death toll. Hitler killed 28 million damn soviets in JUST the invasions of the ussr. Just to compare the brutality of both, Hitler killed 6 million polish people in his invasion of Poland in 1939. The soviets in comparison left 350,000 dead. It’s just an entirely different scale of genocide which was enabled. 

I am no communist nor do I have sympathies with the ussr, but I hate how westerners warp this stuff. 
            I didn't attribute it to malice; I attributed it to Communism,  which can be given *direct* attribution for famine. And I, a "Westerner", didn't come up with these numbers. I was pulling from Solzhenitsyn. So I'm not sure your identity politics plays here. And the 80+ million doesn't include WWII deaths.

EDIT: I'm not even sure I get the point your point.
                Sort of sort. For instance when the great famine hit China, it was caused by failing infrastructure by 25 years of war and natural disasters. Mao implemented policies to relive the famine (killing birds etc) but ended up causing more problems. It’s debatable whether this would have happened with communism or not, and the 1959-1963 famine which killed 40 million wasn’t too different from pre communist famines. 

The ussr was a bit different. They weaponized famine against populations they didn’t like, mostly Ukrainians. When famine and drought hit in 1933, they specifically did not send help to relieve the famine in Ukraine and took their food to punish the Ukrainians. But the overall famine of the era was caused by natural disasters for the most part, it was pretty normal for famine to erupt every decade or two in the region. 
        I get your point, but to imply capitalism doesn't give us similar numbers is crazy
            I just want to play games 
                Then go play my son, play to hearts content or until you get in trouble. Whichever comes first
            Is it? I think your ignorant of the horrendous conditions instantiated in and by communist states.
                I️ think you’re probably ignorant of the conditions that Britain imposed on its colonies, forcing India to produce cash crops in times of famine that killed ended up killing millions of people, to give a single example.
                    I thought you were talking about Capitalism, but now you're referencing the terrors of Imperialism... I can't say I follow.

                        WW1 and 2 could both be argued to be capitalistic wars. Germany slid down the path of Nazism due to the economic hardship resulting from a capitalist economy crash. Also cant forget all of the manufacturers and rich war barons, whom profited from both wars and millions of deaths. Also see multiple other wars and injustices done in capitalist countries and you'll realise the system isn't the problem, it's always who leads at the end.
                            Lolwut. Germany didn't fall into economic depression because capitalism, they did so because the Treaty of Versailles fucked them sideways economically and they had no way to pay reparations besides printing money.

And while people made nauseating amounts of money off the world wars, it's more than a bit of a stretch to call them "capitalist wars"
                                Well Germany didn't lose its economy due to a single reason at that time, the Rhineland was occupied and the reparations were fair but harsh, i agree, but the great depression, which jumpstarted the hyperinflation of Germany, as well as strong state ownership was capitalistic in nature,.
It IS a stretch, because whether Communism or capitalism, the deaths of millions on either side was due to humans, the ability to do evil isn't tied to economical models. This is why i tried to grossly point that out with that argument, I dislike seeing red-scare type of comments used as meme, kills potential discussion.
                            Germany didn’t go to Nazism because of a capitalist crash. The treaty of Versailles put the blame of the war on them even though all of Europe was ready to throw punches at the start of the war. Hell, people were asking to forgive Germany’s supposed dent to Europe because they knew it would eventually lead to another war and guess what happened? Why do you think the US helped offset parts of the cost of the war and rebuilding following the war? 
        And that's nothing compared to how many people have died of Malaria!
        I have no clue why you were downvoted lol
            Because it doesn't compare. People dying "due to communism" is a bullshit statistic in and off itself, but it's especially shitty when compared to people dying in war, i.e killing each other. 
            because this statistic is made up from the debunked black book of communism
            They weren't REAL Communists!!!


/s
                That's cause real communism isn't possible. No country has ever followed Marx's process to communism, it's just not going to happen. 

                    >  Marx's process to communism

lol you say that like it's some step by step recipe by the chef Karlito Marks
                    And it's not going to, unless humans change fundamentally. Marxs idea of communism is almost too utopian for me. 
                        Why? It’s basically the fundamentalism of lesser human mind. “I need more free stuff, others should give it to me”
                            That's exactly the mindset of a capitalist in Marx's works, well done understanding it.
                                So basically it’s a literature work of projection, zero responsibility and all control of wealth through the nanny state. It has 0 to do with capitalism and free market in real world though.
                    The kibbutz system in Israel was pretty close.

I agree though. The economy is to complicated to plan, it's best to let it just happen organically
                        economies need intervention, no such thing as an entirely "organic" economy
            Very easy, it doesn't matter to the current story. Gotten pretty annoying on reddit that some people somehow think it's necessary to daily fearmonger about communism as if the proletariat is planning to revolt next tuesday and implement some archaic economic-political system that failed more times than you got finger on your hands. 

Not to mention the whole number is misleading, obviously communism isn't a person cutting millions of peoples throats, nor did eg the soviets ever commit genocide, nor did that many people actually starve, but that's another story that really doesn't belong here.

Or the basic idea that it's fucking retarded to use the remembrance of a tragedy far in the past, on reddit of all places, as some political gunpowder against imaginary opponents. 
            Because no one asked. Think.
            You really don't? Have you seen how many openly communist users reddit has? It's sickening.

Edit: the downvotes prove my point.
                Don't worry, they will keep growing.

                    Mostly a poor attempt at socialism due to corruption, not communism.
                        Isnt that always the excuse though? Communism doesnt work because your relying on humans who hold power to be fair. 
                            It is a universal excuse for every system. There's no perfect socialism capitalism or communism.  Not one system is better, and none is ever perfectly implemented due to humans. Simply blaming Venezuela's situation to socialism is not looking at the big picture is all I wanted to tell him.
                                No there isnt a perfect system, but id rather have one where im allowed property and the right to criticize whom id like.

                    Then you can compare the deaths of these individual wars to other wars, e.g WW2, and it would be an appropriate comparison. Counting vague nonsense numbers as "deaths by communism" and putting them against deaths in certain wars is fucking stupid. 
                    And capitalism has caused victims of war all over the Middle East and Central America, but again, this isn’t the time or place. To be clear, communism is a terrible and harmful system, but that doesn’t mean I’m always looking for an opportunity to shit on it. Know your place.

        Big if true
    But at least they died in a war that was necessary. 
    60 million in WWII
        77 million in ww2
            Guess it [depends on the source.](https://www.nationalww2museum.org/students-teachers/student-resources/research-starters/research-starters-worldwide-deaths-world-war) [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties) says 70m to 85m. Jesus.....
                **World War II casualties**

World War II was the deadliest military conflict in history in absolute terms of total casualties. Over 60 million people were killed, which was about 3% of the 1940 world population (est. 2.3 billion). Statistics of military wounded are available for the major combatants.

    Holy fucking shit, why did I never hear of that? Wikipedia even claims 50-100 mio global, 3-6% of world population.

That's likely worse than WW2. Oo
        And that's why modern governments flip their shit when a possible pandemic arises.  

Presuming a comparable death toll, we could be looking at 400 million dead, with a much higher ceiling given the poverty, population density, and already overtaxed medical services in places like India or China.

It's a testament to mankind's fear of contagion that we stand guard against something no one in living memory has experienced.
            > It's a testament to mankind's fear of contagion that we stand guard against something no one in living memory has experienced.

Until a few years ago AIDS was killing two million africans every year. I think we got plenty reminder as to how dangerous disease can get.
                Thats a preventable condition that is not spread due to contact but ignorance and risky behaivor... big difference
                    Yup.  
        Also called the "Spanish Flu."
            Somehow I'm sure the spanish got another name for it :\^)
                Royal Flu. We are very proud of it.
                    Very progressive.
                Probably 'Catalan Flu'.
Fun fact: People were literally drowning in mud at Passchendaele.

They would get stuck from the waist up and people couldn't help them because of the lack of solid footing. You couldn't dig around because the mud was almost like a liquid. You could only leave some of them there, from the waist up, crying for help.
    Doesn't sound that fun...
    Nobody thought to toss them a rope?
        Apparently it didn't work.
        Or a syringe!
    "Fun" fact. 😔
    Two days ago marked the 100 anniversary of the end of the battle of Passchendaele. November 10th, lest we forget.
Thinking of all the individual horrific ways each person died is just too much 
Remember that number next time something like 9-11 happens. Terrorism sucks. War is worse.
    Yap. The tragedies of peace time pale in comparision to the daily horror of war.
    But war is profitable... so that's good right?!
        Actual wars really really aren't. War in general is wasted resources by any definition. It is lucrative for certain people to have small conflicts.
            It is incredibly lucrative for certain people...lots of things are "wasted resources" that make certain people lots of money.
            The military industrial complex though
            It depends. WWI and II massively damaged the economies of Britain, France, Germany, Russia etc., whereas America made billions out of them.
F
18 million is... a bit overstated. It was more around 10-12 million. 
    Still barf worthy 
And that many could be saved if the medics did their job
    And boy do I love rushing out of cover for the revive, just as they skip and leave me awkwardly shuffling my feet in no mans land.
        I always imagine that feeling is like being a medic, running up to a fallen soldier and realizing there's nothing you can do to help.  The BF version 
            It's more like running up to a fallen soldier that you could easily save, but then he shoots himself 🕺
                I wonder if that actually happened in the WW's.
    We do our fucking job mate, you lot just can't wait 4 seconds to respawn.
        I'm actually a medic 95% of the time.  Just think there should be more of us.   It's an unstoppable wave when you have 5 medics in a squad 
            Most of my score is just because of this cycle (revive, supres fire, drop med crate, repeat) there have been times I've had mvp in a match with a 9-25 K/D
                Same I'm normally in the top 3 on my team every match just doing this.
                    I would love a squad of just medics. 5 medics running like a wave of unstoppable death... Untill we run out of ammo at least.
                        And that’s when the support squad comes in! A maelstrom of bullets!
            Not having medics is probably the leading cause of losses in operations, aside from having too many scouts. A well balanced team could probably win a vast majority of operations, regardless of overall skill. 
                My dream is to have a full team of medics who all heal
                    But who's gonna deal with the tanks that roll up? Then you'd need medics with rifle grenades. 
                        One good assault.
                            And a Support with Ammo pouches to quickly resupply the Assault.
 
And one scout with spotting flares, the support should also resupply this scout so that he keeps the enemies lighted up.  
  
Now that's a dream team.
                                Yeah. There should be one of everything with ptfo loadouts and the rest medics. I don't understand why people don't abuse the hell out of the medic class. You've got Jesus' best superpowers ffs
    My tag in BF1 is medics die first. I’m assault class
One can only speculate.
    S
And every single person was using submachine guns.
Gonna play the cheeses dickhead but this post isn’t really for Hellriegel memes.
Yep. Especially on PS4 since EVERY ASSAULT USES IT. But when a medic saves me I rejoice!
Want to know what the scary thing is? The 20th century was more peaceful than the 19th century, and centuries preceding it.

If the world seems violent today, it is only because our news media lacks perspective. Truthfully, we are living in a practical golden age of peace. We really are lucky.
    The second half of the 20th century is also called the "long peace" because none of the major economic and military powers fought one another since WW2, albeit they fought proxy wars against poorer less developed nations. And even the deaths in all post WW2 conflicts don't come close to the amount that died between 1939 and 1945. Look at the top of the comments for a great video about the deaths in WW2 and after.

        What happens when we run out of poor nations to proxy with?
            We'll fight proxy wars within another country. 
            Cold wars in cyberspace.
    Yupp, WW1 was mostly something that truly remained in the modern, western memory and left marks. Otherwise it was more or less a direct continuation of conflicts like the napoleonic wars.
        You’re right it is pretty much considered the ‘first war’ of modern times 
            And I was just checking back, but holy shit, while the napoleonic wars caused ~6 million deaths, the thirty years war caused ~8 millions deaths almost 200 years earlier.

The latter one being with a much lower population density and mostly limited to the holy roman empire's grounds. That's fucking terrifying. Oo
                Record keeping from these days is ALWAYS suspect dude.
                    Of course it is, and historians know that too. And there is a consensus that parts of germany were depopulated by those conflicts, so those numbers might not be so unrealistic.
                        Not all historians are truth seeking people.
                            That's why you check on the consensus.
                                That's why a consensus means nothing apart from its majority design. Majority's are often wrong or ineffective and detailing the truth about poorly kept data.
                while i can't rember the exact numbers i know the thirty years war killed a higher percentage of the worlds population. with only melee weapons and very early guns too. 
            To be fair, that's why this game was called "Battlefield One" in the first place
    i’ve heard 20th was most violent century
        During the 17th century century's 30 years war roughly 1/3rd the population of central europe died, in some places as much as 2/3rds was killed. By comparison WWII killed only about 3-4% of the world's population.
            there were about 200,000,000 deaths in 20th century from war and famine. there were about 3 billion people at the time in 1950 alone, so that is an upwards of 8% of the world population killed. 

                However by the end of the 20th century the population was 6 billion, so the % drops dramatically if you consider the whole century's deaths vs the population. However measuring deaths over such a time period can be inaccurate.

But, even going on your numbers. The Taiping Rebellion for instance has a death toll estimated to be up to 100,000,000 (though the real number is likely much lower) which represented at the very least 10% of the world's 1 billion population. All that from a single conflict. The Spanish/Portuguese Conquest of South America in the 16th century was even deadlier and likely the single most destructive event in human history. 
                    [here’s something i found out of curiosity, the death % for population was greatest in 20th century](https://imgur.com/gallery/kfzdj) 
                        I'm sorry but whatever source that came from is pure bullshit, and looks kind of euro-centric. More people died in China in the 19th century than that list claims died in the whole world. The death toll in the Americas in the 16th century was likely over 100 million at the least and it claims only 1-2 million died. Even the death toll in just Europe during the 17th century exceeds what this list claims.
                            And many records from hundreds of years ago are bullshit too man. You have no actual way of verifying any of it.
    > Truthfully, we are living in a practical golden age of peace. We really are lucky.

Until it ends, of course. 
I'm in my early twenties (born in the mid 90s) and I just imagine if I was born ***exactly 100 years ago***, I probably would be fighting in the trenches, scrambling to put my gas mask on, avoiding artillery fire, trying not to get sniped, etc etc...

**Just some crazy thoughts**
    You and me both man, would have been 20 in 1914 if I were born 100 years ago, ripe age to get shipped out to WWI
Yep, it wasn't so long ago either. Born a hundred years earlier and that would be us dying. Crazy.
    Yeah right I was born 100 years and six months after a certain Adolf Hitler
        ...Hitler fought in WW1.
        Which one?
        ?

If you were born in 1889 you would have been in WWI, and probably died.
99 years ago today my family was taking my great great grandma to be buried. My grandmother was not quite two years old, and remembers riding in to Dauphin Manitoba in the sleigh with her grandma's body, hearing all the church bells ringing and guns being fired as people celebrated the end of the war.
And then people still want to call the French cowards. Look at Verdun and tell me they’re cowards.
"World War II casualties of Poland. Approximately six million Polish citizens perished during World War II: about one fifth of the pre-war population. Most were civilian victims of the war crimes and crimes against humanity during the occupation by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union."

Edit - hashtags - i mean exclamation marks of course ^^


To.be fair, he was an idiot
    Yeah. It seems like one of those things where he didn't want to go home in disgrace, and the higher ups kinda just let it slide. He definitely didn't deserve the post-humous promotion, but it was one of those feel good things to help the country heal.
        I'm wondering if it was suicide?

It had to be.  PTSD mixed with depression
            That's basically what it sounds like. Like suicide by cop, but with machine guns. It was Americans that told the story too, and even they said the Germans were trying to wave him off. As with most tragedies in war though, we will never know the full story.
They literally fought up to the last minute
**Henry Gunther**

Henry Nicholas John Gunther (June 6, 1895 – November 11, 1918) was an American soldier and the last soldier of any of the belligerents to be killed during World War I. He was killed at 10:59 a.m., one minute before the Armistice was to take effect at 11 a.m.

a lot of people were killed after the official cease fire
What passing-bells for these who die as cattle? 
Only the monstrous anger of the guns. 
Only the stuttering rifles' rapid rattle 
Can patter out their hasty orisons.

No mockeries now for them; no prayers nor bells; 
Nor any voice of mourning save the choirs, –
The shrill, demented choirs of wailing shells; 
And bugles calling for them from sad shires.
What candles may be held to speed them all? 
Not in the hands of boys but in their eyes 
Shall shine the holy glimmers of goodbyes. 
The pallor of girls' brows shall be their pall; 
Their flowers the tenderness of patient minds, 
And each slow dusk a drawing-down of blinds.

Anthem for doomed youth- Wilfred Owen
    Bent double, like old beggars under sacks, 

Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge, 

Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs, 

And towards our distant rest began to trudge. 

Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots, 

But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind; 

Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots 

Of gas-shells dropping softly behind. 


Gas! GAS! Quick, boys!—An ecstasy of fumbling 

Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time, 

But someone still was yelling out and stumbling 

And flound’ring like a man in fire or lime.—

Dim through the misty panes and thick green light, 

As under a green sea, I saw him drowning. 


In all my dreams before my helpless sight, 

He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning. 


If in some smothering dreams, you too could pace 

Behind the wagon that we flung him in, 

And watch the white eyes writhing in his face, 

His hanging face, like a devil’s sick of sin; 

If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood 

Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,

Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud 

Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,—

My friend, you would not tell with such high zest 

To children ardent for some desperate glory, 

The old Lie: Dulce et decorum est 

Pro patria mori.

*Dulce et Decorum Est*

*Wilfred OWEN*
        Holy shit. I can just picture the guy panicking to get his mask on, unable to do so as the gas envelops him...burning out his eyes, choking on his own lungs as they essentially dissolved inside him...

This is why gas was banned from all future wars after WWI. It was far too horrible a way to die.
            It was banned pre-ww1, including things such as Tear Gas, but none of the major European powers gave a shit. France were the first nation to use any form of gas warfare in WW1, prompting the Germans into developing something worse than Tear Gas.

Thus, modern biological warfare was born. 
    The sad thing is, Wilfred Owen died during the war, a week before the armistice.
had to do analysis for this poem a few times going through school (Canadian), and I hated it at the time. but it's such a moving piece, I wish I would have taken it more seriously then

Edit2: oh good it's doing not-bad
I was just telling a friend the other day that next November is Poland's centennial. 
    December 6th this year for Finland. 
        Too bad it doesn't exist
    Not really. It is going to be a centennial of Polish independence after the partitions, not Poland in general.
It's a fantastic podcast.

I've listened to "Blueprint for Armageddon" 3 times now 
    So good! They're all good. 
        I just wish he had more on iTunes 
I've been thinking of getting into listening to some podcasts but I don't really much about them, what does this one talk about? 
    WW1 and with stories and quotes from all political sides. Also the brutality and goodness in all humans. The best narration I've listened to. 
    He also has other historical periods and stories. One on Ghengis Khan is incredible too. 
    Radiolab is another great podcast. It’s not about ww1 . But they cover a lot of different topics. A personal favorite of mine is called “the buried bodies case”.
    Dan Carlin's Hardcore History pods are really good (also really, really long) basically narrations of a certain event, or set of events, or war. In depth, dramatic.

Not sure if they would be the first pod I'd recommend to someone (although was basically the first I've listened to. Started with his Prophets of Doom episode, FWIW).

Gotten really in to a lot of podcasts since then (about a year and a half ago), however. Got plenty of recommendations, depending what you are in to.
I listened to it once last year and I don't know if I could do it again (length of the thing notwithstanding). It really set something off in me, made me realize what the human cost of wars really mean. I began to imagine if I had been in a trench, or more importantly the fact that there were 18 million "me"s in those trenches (that is to say, real people with hopes and dreams and little quirks)  who all died for what was essentially no fucking reason. And that all 18 million of them and all 70-odd million casualties of World War 2 were real people with their own lives and not numbers on a page like I always saw them to be. 

But yeah, really good podcast. Would recommend.
    WW2 numbers are inflated.
I bet most of us would be injured or killed right now of it was 100 years ago
That ending always makes me sad,  I think it's because it's such a funny light show with such a realistic ending
    I agree, this is exactly what makes the ending so utterly devastating. I hope they never reprise the roles in another series, the finality and total silence that has followed since we watched the characters go "over the top" is a poignant reminder of the human tragedy of the sacrifice made during the Great War. 
    The amazing thing about it is that they screwed it up when they filmed it, so they had to create a new ending in post-production:

Do you mind if I sit here, down by you're graveside
    never fails to make me teary eyed, have you heard the high kings cover from memory lane? my personal favorite. 

in that faithful heart are you forever 19
        No I haven't yet, I'll check it out
            such a senseless war 
I’m too drunk for this tonight, thanks for cutting the onions dick!
"Well how do you do young billy? I cried

Do you mind if I sit here by your graveside and rest for a while, I've been walking all day and I'm nearly done.

I see by your gravestone you were only 19 when you joined the great fallen in 1916.

I hope you died well and I hope you died clean,  or young Billy McBride was it slow and unseen?

Did they beat the drums slowly?"
Millions*

France lost a hundred thousand in 1 week at Verdun
    Did they though? The record keeping from this age is not very good. Russia likes to say they lost like 30m plus in WW2 but no one actually believes that.
        France had better record keeping in WW1 then Russia in WW2.

We had proper military documents and service lists we can read and study.

Russia just finished its red purge and was not organized during ww2
            Every government including France will resort to propaganda to make themselves look better. Sure, I am not saying they were as bad as Russia lol. I just don't get remembrance days based on numbers alone. It comes off as cheesy to me. 

Definitely with WW2 in that those numbers are purely ridiculous on some levels. For Jews, Germans, and Russians. I don't believe any of the final numbers. Russia's are off the charts bullshit.

Still incredibly high mind you, more than anything else. It's just a pity everyone feels the need to lie about it.
Yes for the series but we still have one more year to go mate.
Haha, I'm picturing them not clarifying this and one side stopping the war before the other.
Not of WW1...  lol
    There are some still world war 1 vets 
        No there isn't.   They'd be over 118 years old by now
            Your right the guy I was thinking of passed in 2012 
It already is in most places.

USA, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, France, Poland, Russia, Turkey and probably a couple more.


    Next year or in general? I mean like a full on "no work" national holiday
        Yes, paid day off.

In general, every year
            That’s fantastic! I’ve never heard of a single employer here in the UK doing that, and I have worked or have friends in a whole ton of professions
                I thought it was, my wife is from the UK and she said November 11 is for Remembrance Day so I assumed it would be a bank holiday like Canada
                    No bank holiday, I  still work but we have silence at 11:00 for 5 minutes 
                        That's lame, canada gives us a full day off paid
                            We observed 100% silence for two minutes and I work in a call centre with 1000 other people. I was proud of my guys.
Yeah I was really excited for COD.  

It sucks compared to BF1
    I'm still surprised people compare Bf and COD. They use two completely different styles. COD is an arcade shooter while Bf is a, well open battlefield shooter that has all sorts of vehicles.
        Honestly they are both great, and i love ww2. Its like when people compare CSGO and R6.
        The comparison is how much fun I have playing them both. And I don't have fun playing cod, but I do playing battlefield. There for, for me at least, battlefield is better than cod. 
    COD gonna COD.

They found a model that was profitable and they will never, ever change it. 
        Cod... Cod never changes...
    I've heard good things about the campaign, though.  Have you tried that?
        I heard the first thing that happens is you get off the boat in Normandy to PPSH fire from the Germans who have a mix of SS and Wehrmacht uniforms.
            So, I'm not too familiar with the details, but the PPSH was a Soviet gun, and you're saying there shouldn't be any SS uniforms, right?  Basically, you're criticizing the historical accuracy.
                Correct, and they shied away from displaying the swastika and used the iron cross instead.
                    Lack of swastikas was in multiplayer only, I believe, which is understandable.  The campaign has them, as far as I know.
Obviously somebody had to turn this thread into a shit on COD thing. This is about taking a moment to reflect on all the people that gave their lives in WW1 and you've gotta taint it with this nonsense? 
    Because I love battlefield 1. 
Of course this subreddit finds a way to turn a memorial post into some anti-cod circlejerking shit...

Are you guys really any better than /r/WWII
    The salt in unnecessary. 
100% agree. My friends shit on me for getting season pass (only paid $26 anyways) and playing it as much as I️ do. Had like 4 buddies ask if I️ was getting WW2 and were so taken back by me saying no. Why would I️ spend money on another CoD that is just going to take me back to the days of rage quitting and breaking controllers? CoD was amazing back in the day and it was my second love after Halo 2, but with BF1 running the way it is with the content that it has and it’s historical appeal, it blows it out of the water. 
You're right poor sentence structure on my part, sorry
    it made me laugh lol
Well actually, after the war the Spanish Flu epidemic kicked off killing around 50 million worldwide.
War is fucking stupid, but if you think WW2 was a no reason war, then so are you.
    WW2 happened because of WW1 being such a pointless clusterfuck of just pure utter human stupidity. 
        Before the Armistice 99 years ago, parties on all sides knew round two was coming soon. It only took 21 years.  
        Dammit Europe
    He didn't say anything about WW2

EDIT: I did a derp
        >sending 18 million young men to go die for no reason was something that should never happen again, and then it happened again and was even worse

That pretty much means WW2
            Oh, good point.
> there seems to be a a growing fetish of accusing someone of not being patriotic enough.

A growing fetish?

Dude it was so bad in WWI that british women started a campaign to shame any man who hadn't enlisted into doing so by giving them a white flower. 
    Is white flower a metaphor for something? Or a literal white flower?
        Read back up, it was a white feather. White feathers have traditionally been symbolic of cowardice (or peace, if being used as an anti-war slogan)
            Oh i see. Thats messed up
                Oh it's worse than that. Not only were people getting publicly shamed into enlisting, even soldiers on leave and discharged veterans were getting harassed.
                    Male privilege tho, amirite
                    Damn that sucks. Was it like that in america?
Your line "nobody is forced to go fighting (at least in most of the West) " reminds me of a question that snuck into my brain recently, at least with regard to US military service.

If college and healthcare were universal and free in the US, what would that do to military enlistment? 

EDIT: Forgot a word.
    People would still join to fight for their country or to get out of their hometown. 
        That's not the point. The point is how many fewer people would enlist. 
            The majority of Veterans I know joined for economic reasons: GI bill, training, lack of opportunities in a small rural town.

The rest joined because of family tradition, except that one fucktard that just wanted to kill people.
                I know one in high school who joined just to kill. 
                    I know a few from my high school who said the same. I guess they think its gonna all play out like a game of call of duty or something. 
                        Ya it’s just fucking crazy man. 
                        If you get a chance to talk to someone that's combat arms in the Army, it's a fairly common mindset. We know it's not like CoD, but our job is to take ground and kill the enemy, and we embrace it.
                            Thats one thing. Its another thing to be a kid in high school who hasnt even had a taste of this combat and say they already love it. What about when they’re on the receiving end of the ass kicking?
                                Oh yeah, there's a huge difference. Those kids that talk big usually go for a desk job and act all badass. Or cooks lol
                I saw a reddit post earlier for a certain US military branch, where well over half the enlisted personnel did it for economic reasons. Its fucked, you shouldn't have to hold a rifle and go to a foreign land to fight a war to get university education and health care. 
    The poor fight for the rich. And it has always been this way... 
        They destroy and they also build for the rich
    Depends on branch and MOS
How old are you? Curious. Teens, 20s? 

If you ever take the time out of your day to go to a remembrance ceremony, you will find families there who have lost people at war. Go and say that to them and see how far you get.

I lost an Uncle in the Falklands and the knock on effect on the family tore it apart for over 20 years. He enlisted because there simply weren't any other jobs out there which had some manner of career progression. He was on the RFA Sir Galahad. 

He enlisted in the 70s during the 3 day week, where Britain was in a complete mess. Look that up if you are too young to remember it, which I assume you are. 

Many enlist because it just happens to be the trade of the family. Like they aren't born to do anything else. 

It's not about Patriotism, it's about acknowledging an inevitable sacrifice that is made to maintain some form of order in a world constantly on the ropes. 

New Wave Liberalism has created this disgusting notion that people should be ashamed for serving their country. If we ever have forced conscription again, I look forward to seeing the attitudes change of all these millennials who should spend more time studying history and less time on Instagram.


    Why do people get so mad over millennials? People seem to think it's fine to throw blanket statements everywhere that fits their mindset.
        Millennials is just a cover for "the young generation is bad".

It's like the people using it know how retarded and senile that idea is, because the elders also said it about their made up generation, but now they try really hard to justify doing the same, while destracting with giving that generation  a specific name.
        Because its rare I’ve spoken with one who’s opinions aren’t shaped by social media & pop culture rather than actual real life experience.
            It's rare that I've spoken to an older generation that isn't influenced by social media either. That doesn't mean that entire generation is bad.
                Of course not. Not saying the whole generation is "bad". 
    You seem to have misunderstood his comment. 
        Sorry, I don't agree. 

People who have never been to any form of Remembrance Day ceremony to get a real idea of what it's about. To speak with the families and people there. It's not a celebration of war in the slightest. It's the exact opposite of that but focuses on why some of these wars were unavoidable.

It's very different to the portrayal you get on social media where the Poppy and Union Jack are being used to push a right wing agenda. 

I hear this same sentiment from people all the time. Usually from people in their early 20s or younger. Many can even hold a straight face and make out that WWI / WWII could have been avoided from a British perspective, which just isn't true. 




            > It's not a celebration of war in the slightest.

I attended my town's Remembrance Day ceremony today. The speaker asked us to remember and celebrate all past, present, and future military members and all they have done. I support the holiday, and will continue to do so. Sayings it's not a celebration is wrong though. 

We remember those that fell (or will in the future) while also celebrating the country's goals and achievements won.
            He's not talking about Remembrance Day ceremonies though. You've misread his entire comment and become offended over nothing.  
                I'm not offended. And yes he is talking about Remembrance Day.

 I think it's you that seems to be a bit confused here. 

"Living in the UK it just feels very hard to think that Remembrance Day hasn't turned into a patriotic pro-war day of drivel."

Why I mentioned the ceremonies which show you what it's actually about, far more than social media / pop culture will. 

                    He clearly wasn't talking about ceremonies.

Turn on the news and you get a better picture.
                    Yes but the ceremonies are not the only part of the day, he's very clearly talking about the more modern aspects of Remembrance Day. Not just the ceremonies. 

Remembrance Day ceremonies have always been very tasteful and somber events that highlight the horrors of war. What op is talking about though is the corporate and political highjacking of days like today. Very clear difference. 
                    War is stupid and most of them volunteered to go there. So whatever happened after that, it's on them. This is not a video game, you sign up for the possibility of DYING in DAY ONE. There's no jobs about? Well fucking move somewhere else then.
                        Some people are born warriors and soldiers. Doesn't mean it's not on them, but doesn't mean their deaths don't mean anything. No need to disrespect just because you don't agree.
                            in the grand scheme of things, let's just say that the Vietnam war deaths don't mean absolutely anything. 
    the point 










your head
    I think you're generalizing just a tad there, son. 
    No I agree with this ...

It's sometimes if the world I live in , no one cares about all the sacrifices that happened ... The world isn't a perfect place , and to think that what we have today isn't because millions died .. 

I don't know what to say to those people . Wish the world didn't have a need for conflict and war :/
    [deleted]
        >If a WW3 ever happens,...

You say that as if we aren't currently teetering on the edge of it...
That idealization/worship you describe (at least in America) stems from a sort of social guilt that developed after Vietnam.





In general the treatment of veterans was god awful after the Vietnam war. What was anger at the government was directed at returning veterans, who were facing a myriad of mental conditions, because we had already moved on politically from Vietnam and there was still a lot of anger.







So as a result of this many Americans started to revere veterans as idols.



And honestly I don’t think that’s bad, it’s not up to the soldier to decide if we go to war. It is rather the duty of the civilian to elect responsible representatives, who choose war with consideration to its horrific cost. To attack the praise we give our veterans as fetishizing war, is wholly misguided and shifts blame for war.





But that’s my 2¢
So true. Look at how many USMC fanbois there are.

You are dumb as fuck.

Go get some historical context.
    Their comment rings true with a lot of public sentiment in the Commonwealth after the First World War. People went in cheering for war and came out broken. 

The shift in ideas, art, politics, etc., was huge. PM Chamberlain lived through the First World War and knew how horrible it was, affecting his own politics. Why do you think Britain and France were so willing to let Nazi Germany get away with a lot of shit early on? They knew what total war in that age would bring. 

You should get some historical context yourself.
As someone else in the UK I think it just stems from the influence of America, but also actually its just these opinions are louder.
Most of the people I see heavily supporting the military or police aren’t for war at all, they’re just willing to put down their lives for me and you if necessary.  After seeing world war 1, 2, Vietnam, and newer conflicts, no one who actually fought or have seen how they fought would want war.  The only people that do are those on top who sit in safety, and the small minority of the mentally unstable 
IIRC they don't do things like this out of respect for either getting it wrong or trying to profit from a tragedy

**However** I believe this year there are some poppy-related dog tags which people get

http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/press-f-to-pay-respects
"If by any chance/In case" with the intention of avoiding that to happen, more or less.
It’s a weird one but it’s basically ‘in case we forget’, so the poppy is a reminder of what happened, so that we don’t forget
It basically means in the full poem that; our soldiers sacrifices are not in vain unless we forget and become destined to repeat the slaughter
"Press F to pay respects". Google it.

                Have you considered it's not trolling, per se? Obviously, I'm trolling you right here and now, but at the same time, all the lurkers that wouldn't have said anything did, in fact, pay respects. Not to mention, the top comment is about how absurd and terrible the death toll really is. 

So yeah. You can say the thread is shit, and that's your opinion, but it isn't. It still serves the same purpose, which is to remind us of what was supposed to be the war to end all wars, but only marks the beginning of an exceptionally bloody period in history, and a race for power fueled by military expansion: the end, and beginning, of an era. 

So, tl:dr, just because people don't pour their hearts out doesn't mean they don't get it. 
        I think it's great,   

I was expecting this post to get about 16 upvotes total.   

Seams like there's a lot of respect here actually 
 Think you meant 'Rupture'
    Dammit, wrong game
         Don't sweat it. 
Well 18 million is the number studied and given by historians not by governments.
In one of the call of dutys (advanced warfare?) There's a funeral scene where the game prompts you to press f to pay respects
    X or Square if you're on Xbox or PS4 (respectively)
Flanders Field, France 
I know it’s a game set in WWI but maybe a bit too insensitive to do something in game to mark this. 
    very least they could do a dog tag marking the day. just sumthing to mark it. they could have done a message as you logged on like they do for lots of things. but to do nothing just seems so wrong. 

        Yeah that would have been decent. 
    Have the game display a poppy on 11/11/18 for a whole day
Flanders Field
    Thanks!
It's 2017...   
Why?

They're all paying respect in their own way
    If your friends or family members died and you decided to make a post on the internet would you want people to type F? It's a meme - typing F is making a mockery of a terrible event that wiped out almost an entire generation of young men, not including civilian deaths.
        I served in the military for 3 years, even served with a guy who was killed in Afghanistan.   My great  uncle was killed at the Somme.

I'd rather them have them take 2 seconds out of their day to pay respects in their own way.   If gamers want to press f then I'll thank them for it.  Going to the Ceremony and laying a poppy isn't for everyone.
        This is a video gaming subreddit on the internet, not your local cenotaph.
        Yes because we experienced this and we are responsible for the war. I don't believe those inflated numbers anyway.
            You need to do some reading then. 
TIL paying respects is disrespectful. And I thought everyone was joking when they said people get offended from anything.
Yes the phrasing is confusing, but that is the overall casualties of the war
Fuck that map, literally one of the worst BF1 maps imo
    It's my favourite actually 
        Why tho?? It’s so poorly designed. All the action is focused on B, which is a two-level corner/balcony camp-fest clusterfuck. Basically all you need to win is to hold that flag and either A or C and you’ve won. Hell, I’ve won just by holding the B flag and out killing the other team. 
            Because it's always a slaughter for the attacking side.   It's futile going after B.

It makes me think that's a real taste of WW1.   Doomed attacks that do nothing, a slaughter and wasted lives for nothing taken.    When you view it like that and that you won't win it's a fun experience.
My first thought too

    Already seen that video at least 10 times because I love it so much. Very powerful and sad but interesting at the same time. 
        I had to go watch it again after your comment then I decided I should share just in case someone hasn't seen it. He has one on nuclear war that was uploaded pretty recently as well. 
            The graphic presentation, especially that transfer from German Western Front casualties to the Eastern Front, and then specifically for Stalingrad, gave me goosebumps. 
                The way the soviets kept... on... ticking... it was horrifying. It opened my eyes to the fact that the Germans saw their fight against the soviets as the main fight. It was a fight for survival for both sides. The bloodiest a war can be.
                    I've seen the statistics before but it's hard to really comprehend the scale. Seeing it displayed like this is helpful, and horrifying.
                    There’s always that gut wrenching disgust at the lives lost on Normandy D-day invasion for me because of how well that scene as been adapted to media like Saving Pvt Ryan and Medal of Honor. 

But all those deaths are peanuts compared to Stalingrad. That’s not even innocent civilians either. :-/
                    It just keeps going up...and up....and up.
                    It was a war of extermination. 
                Makes me wonder what would have happened if they stayed allied .
    [deleted]
        Same here. My mother immigrated from Poland in 1976. My paternal grandfather was a POW after the Soviets took him to fight, he escaped and tried to walk back across the German front. He spent six years as a POW. What I would like to know is how many of those Polish deaths were by Soviets.
        I often think of this ... It is scary .
    Thank you for sharing this. 
    The Eastern Front was literally hell on earth to those who were involved. Germany and its allies suffered a terrible toll against the Soviets. The Soviets bled the most out of all the countries involved in the war. WWII was a terrible nightmare.
    Holy fuck i never realized how devastating WWII was for the soviets. That counter kept going and going. 
        Yeah that was the biggest shock for me too, even with all the projects and research I did in school on the pacific theater.
            And to be fair. School history never did a good job of talking about the eastern front. I only recall learning about Stalingrad maybe twice throughout junior high and high school. This video is great at creating a picture for how devastation it was for the Soviets. 
                Post-cold war propaganda and relationships has our society pretty adverse to recognizing the Soviets efforts in the war and how they far surpassed our own. 

We're pretty afraid to display that without them...there was absolutely no chance of saving western europe. 
                    My school barely even spoke about the world wars. History education in England is embarrassing. I can honestly say anything I know about history is because I went out and learnt it myself. Worrying to think about the amount of people that are completely unaware of the scale of the world wars.
    This is one of the best videos ive ever seen. Thank you for sharing it. 
    Damn good share.

Seriously hope someone dubs that into german. That's exactly the type of video that can be shown in history class and we keep lacking good, short and compressible content like that. 

If any history teacher is reading this, do your best to translate this. Never ever seen WW2 being put into a perspective like that before and this adds so much to the horror and story of that war.
    Thanks for this. Never seen this before. The numbers were so staggering I cried. 
    *Holy shit the Russian dead....*
    Thanks for that link. Really interesting stuff!
A *lot* more than 18mill died in WW2 - but if I remember correctly, due to the population growth between World Wars 1 & 2, a higher percentage of the world's population died in WW1.


Edit: I can't actually find where I remember this from. It might have been a certain year or day during WW1 instead.
    Not even remotely close, 70-80 million died in WW2 compared to 18 million in WW1. Unless the population jumped 6x, that doesn’t make sense. 
        70-80 million is probably the total amount of deaths from ww2, but not soldier related. Could be the difference
            Even then it doesn't make sense. The world population only increased about 30% during that time period. Meanwhile soldier deaths in WW1 were about 8~ million, and soldier deaths in WW2 were anywhere from 17-25 million. 
                It was 18 million,  not 8
                    15-18 million is the upper total, including civilians. About 8 million soldiers died, and anywhere from 5-10 million civilians died, mostly in Russia and the Ottoman Empire. 
        WW2 added terror bombing, China, industrial genocide, famine, new technologies, two tyrants, total war, 2 more years, new fronts but none of that should detract from the fact that all wars are horrific
            Only 2 tyrants?
Yup... Still upchucking 
German keiser "OH EIN HUMANITY!"

Adolf Hitler "Hold mein bier"
    Oh one humanity?
        not looking for accuracy just looking for funny simplicity

            Dummkopf
    Fun fact, Hitler wasn't a big beer drinker. But to appeal to German voters he would often be photographed with a beer stein at his table.
        Not a big beer drinker!? Man, the more I hear about this Hitler bloke, the less i like him.
            Someone should really stop that guy.
Or the 80+ million who died due to Communism in the Soviet Union and China.
    Every time someone brings up WW2, people start with the damn Genocide Olympics.
        I had a classmate like that in school. I was taking a class on Operation Barbarossa and my classmate saw me reading Geoffrey Megargee's War of Annihilation. He pushed aside my book and said "If you think that's bad, you should look up what King Leopold did in the Congo."

I don't understand the fetish of trying to out-genocide things. 
            my dad killed more people than your dad!!
            Many people try to use it to deflect guilt, or to prove that an enemy is worse than you think. 
                whataboutism
                    Whataboutism is used as deflection when criticizing someone. 

“Russia has committed numerous civil rights atrocities”

“What about America? You are lynching negroes” 

Is the classic example. 

        Well with how active the soc dem and red black communities are on reddit, it’s kinda helpful to remember how much agony that ideology brought to the world. 
    That’s a much different story considering 90% of those deaths were from famines, and only really the holondor can be DIRECTLY attributed to malice in this situation. 

It’s just disingenuous to compare Hitler to Stalin or maos death toll. Hitler killed 28 million damn soviets in JUST the invasions of the ussr. Just to compare the brutality of both, Hitler killed 6 million polish people in his invasion of Poland in 1939. The soviets in comparison left 350,000 dead. It’s just an entirely different scale of genocide which was enabled. 

I am no communist nor do I have sympathies with the ussr, but I hate how westerners warp this stuff. 
        I didn't attribute it to malice; I attributed it to Communism,  which can be given *direct* attribution for famine. And I, a "Westerner", didn't come up with these numbers. I was pulling from Solzhenitsyn. So I'm not sure your identity politics plays here. And the 80+ million doesn't include WWII deaths.

EDIT: I'm not even sure I get the point your point.
            Sort of sort. For instance when the great famine hit China, it was caused by failing infrastructure by 25 years of war and natural disasters. Mao implemented policies to relive the famine (killing birds etc) but ended up causing more problems. It’s debatable whether this would have happened with communism or not, and the 1959-1963 famine which killed 40 million wasn’t too different from pre communist famines. 

The ussr was a bit different. They weaponized famine against populations they didn’t like, mostly Ukrainians. When famine and drought hit in 1933, they specifically did not send help to relieve the famine in Ukraine and took their food to punish the Ukrainians. But the overall famine of the era was caused by natural disasters for the most part, it was pretty normal for famine to erupt every decade or two in the region. 
    I get your point, but to imply capitalism doesn't give us similar numbers is crazy
        I just want to play games 
            Then go play my son, play to hearts content or until you get in trouble. Whichever comes first
        Is it? I think your ignorant of the horrendous conditions instantiated in and by communist states.
            I️ think you’re probably ignorant of the conditions that Britain imposed on its colonies, forcing India to produce cash crops in times of famine that killed ended up killing millions of people, to give a single example.
                I thought you were talking about Capitalism, but now you're referencing the terrors of Imperialism... I can't say I follow.

                    WW1 and 2 could both be argued to be capitalistic wars. Germany slid down the path of Nazism due to the economic hardship resulting from a capitalist economy crash. Also cant forget all of the manufacturers and rich war barons, whom profited from both wars and millions of deaths. Also see multiple other wars and injustices done in capitalist countries and you'll realise the system isn't the problem, it's always who leads at the end.
                        Lolwut. Germany didn't fall into economic depression because capitalism, they did so because the Treaty of Versailles fucked them sideways economically and they had no way to pay reparations besides printing money.

And while people made nauseating amounts of money off the world wars, it's more than a bit of a stretch to call them "capitalist wars"
                            Well Germany didn't lose its economy due to a single reason at that time, the Rhineland was occupied and the reparations were fair but harsh, i agree, but the great depression, which jumpstarted the hyperinflation of Germany, as well as strong state ownership was capitalistic in nature,.
It IS a stretch, because whether Communism or capitalism, the deaths of millions on either side was due to humans, the ability to do evil isn't tied to economical models. This is why i tried to grossly point that out with that argument, I dislike seeing red-scare type of comments used as meme, kills potential discussion.
                        Germany didn’t go to Nazism because of a capitalist crash. The treaty of Versailles put the blame of the war on them even though all of Europe was ready to throw punches at the start of the war. Hell, people were asking to forgive Germany’s supposed dent to Europe because they knew it would eventually lead to another war and guess what happened? Why do you think the US helped offset parts of the cost of the war and rebuilding following the war? 
    And that's nothing compared to how many people have died of Malaria!
    I have no clue why you were downvoted lol
        Because it doesn't compare. People dying "due to communism" is a bullshit statistic in and off itself, but it's especially shitty when compared to people dying in war, i.e killing each other. 
        because this statistic is made up from the debunked black book of communism
        They weren't REAL Communists!!!


/s
            That's cause real communism isn't possible. No country has ever followed Marx's process to communism, it's just not going to happen. 

                >  Marx's process to communism

lol you say that like it's some step by step recipe by the chef Karlito Marks
                And it's not going to, unless humans change fundamentally. Marxs idea of communism is almost too utopian for me. 
                    Why? It’s basically the fundamentalism of lesser human mind. “I need more free stuff, others should give it to me”
                        That's exactly the mindset of a capitalist in Marx's works, well done understanding it.
                            So basically it’s a literature work of projection, zero responsibility and all control of wealth through the nanny state. It has 0 to do with capitalism and free market in real world though.
                The kibbutz system in Israel was pretty close.

I agree though. The economy is to complicated to plan, it's best to let it just happen organically
                    economies need intervention, no such thing as an entirely "organic" economy
        Very easy, it doesn't matter to the current story. Gotten pretty annoying on reddit that some people somehow think it's necessary to daily fearmonger about communism as if the proletariat is planning to revolt next tuesday and implement some archaic economic-political system that failed more times than you got finger on your hands. 

Not to mention the whole number is misleading, obviously communism isn't a person cutting millions of peoples throats, nor did eg the soviets ever commit genocide, nor did that many people actually starve, but that's another story that really doesn't belong here.

Or the basic idea that it's fucking retarded to use the remembrance of a tragedy far in the past, on reddit of all places, as some political gunpowder against imaginary opponents. 
        Because no one asked. Think.
        You really don't? Have you seen how many openly communist users reddit has? It's sickening.

Edit: the downvotes prove my point.
            Don't worry, they will keep growing.

                Mostly a poor attempt at socialism due to corruption, not communism.
                    Isnt that always the excuse though? Communism doesnt work because your relying on humans who hold power to be fair. 
                        It is a universal excuse for every system. There's no perfect socialism capitalism or communism.  Not one system is better, and none is ever perfectly implemented due to humans. Simply blaming Venezuela's situation to socialism is not looking at the big picture is all I wanted to tell him.
                            No there isnt a perfect system, but id rather have one where im allowed property and the right to criticize whom id like.

                Then you can compare the deaths of these individual wars to other wars, e.g WW2, and it would be an appropriate comparison. Counting vague nonsense numbers as "deaths by communism" and putting them against deaths in certain wars is fucking stupid. 
                And capitalism has caused victims of war all over the Middle East and Central America, but again, this isn’t the time or place. To be clear, communism is a terrible and harmful system, but that doesn’t mean I’m always looking for an opportunity to shit on it. Know your place.

    Big if true
But at least they died in a war that was necessary. 
60 million in WWII
    77 million in ww2
        Guess it [depends on the source.](https://www.nationalww2museum.org/students-teachers/student-resources/research-starters/research-starters-worldwide-deaths-world-war) [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties) says 70m to 85m. Jesus.....
            **World War II casualties**

World War II was the deadliest military conflict in history in absolute terms of total casualties. Over 60 million people were killed, which was about 3% of the 1940 world population (est. 2.3 billion). Statistics of military wounded are available for the major combatants.

Don’t look up the numbers killed by Mao, the Stalinist purges, Rwandan genocide, or the Khmer Rouge then...
Holy fucking shit, why did I never hear of that? Wikipedia even claims 50-100 mio global, 3-6% of world population.

That's likely worse than WW2. Oo
    And that's why modern governments flip their shit when a possible pandemic arises.  

Presuming a comparable death toll, we could be looking at 400 million dead, with a much higher ceiling given the poverty, population density, and already overtaxed medical services in places like India or China.

It's a testament to mankind's fear of contagion that we stand guard against something no one in living memory has experienced.

Until a few years ago AIDS was killing two million africans every year. I think we got plenty reminder as to how dangerous disease can get.
            Thats a preventable condition that is not spread due to contact but ignorance and risky behaivor... big difference
                Yup.  
    Also called the "Spanish Flu."
        Somehow I'm sure the spanish got another name for it :\^)
            Royal Flu. We are very proud of it.
                Very progressive.
            Probably 'Catalan Flu'.
Doesn't sound that fun...
Nobody thought to toss them a rope?
    Apparently it didn't work.
    Or a syringe!
"Fun" fact. 😔
Two days ago marked the 100 anniversary of the end of the battle of Passchendaele. November 10th, lest we forget.
Yap. The tragedies of peace time pale in comparision to the daily horror of war.
But war is profitable... so that's good right?!
    Actual wars really really aren't. War in general is wasted resources by any definition. It is lucrative for certain people to have small conflicts.
        It is incredibly lucrative for certain people...lots of things are "wasted resources" that make certain people lots of money.
        The military industrial complex though
        It depends. WWI and II massively damaged the economies of Britain, France, Germany, Russia etc., whereas America made billions out of them.
Still barf worthy 
And boy do I love rushing out of cover for the revive, just as they skip and leave me awkwardly shuffling my feet in no mans land.
    I always imagine that feeling is like being a medic, running up to a fallen soldier and realizing there's nothing you can do to help.  The BF version 
        It's more like running up to a fallen soldier that you could easily save, but then he shoots himself 🕺
            I wonder if that actually happened in the WW's.
We do our fucking job mate, you lot just can't wait 4 seconds to respawn.
    I'm actually a medic 95% of the time.  Just think there should be more of us.   It's an unstoppable wave when you have 5 medics in a squad 
        Most of my score is just because of this cycle (revive, supres fire, drop med crate, repeat) there have been times I've had mvp in a match with a 9-25 K/D
            Same I'm normally in the top 3 on my team every match just doing this.
                I would love a squad of just medics. 5 medics running like a wave of unstoppable death... Untill we run out of ammo at least.
                    And that’s when the support squad comes in! A maelstrom of bullets!
        Not having medics is probably the leading cause of losses in operations, aside from having too many scouts. A well balanced team could probably win a vast majority of operations, regardless of overall skill. 
            My dream is to have a full team of medics who all heal
                But who's gonna deal with the tanks that roll up? Then you'd need medics with rifle grenades. 
                    One good assault.
                        And a Support with Ammo pouches to quickly resupply the Assault.
 
And one scout with spotting flares, the support should also resupply this scout so that he keeps the enemies lighted up.  
  
Now that's a dream team.
                            Yeah. There should be one of everything with ptfo loadouts and the rest medics. I don't understand why people don't abuse the hell out of the medic class. You've got Jesus' best superpowers ffs
My tag in BF1 is medics die first. I’m assault class
S
The second half of the 20th century is also called the "long peace" because none of the major economic and military powers fought one another since WW2, albeit they fought proxy wars against poorer less developed nations. And even the deaths in all post WW2 conflicts don't come close to the amount that died between 1939 and 1945. Look at the top of the comments for a great video about the deaths in WW2 and after.

    What happens when we run out of poor nations to proxy with?
        We'll fight proxy wars within another country. 
        Cold wars in cyberspace.
Yupp, WW1 was mostly something that truly remained in the modern, western memory and left marks. Otherwise it was more or less a direct continuation of conflicts like the napoleonic wars.
    You’re right it is pretty much considered the ‘first war’ of modern times 
        And I was just checking back, but holy shit, while the napoleonic wars caused ~6 million deaths, the thirty years war caused ~8 millions deaths almost 200 years earlier.

The latter one being with a much lower population density and mostly limited to the holy roman empire's grounds. That's fucking terrifying. Oo
            Record keeping from these days is ALWAYS suspect dude.
                Of course it is, and historians know that too. And there is a consensus that parts of germany were depopulated by those conflicts, so those numbers might not be so unrealistic.
                    Not all historians are truth seeking people.
                        That's why you check on the consensus.
                            That's why a consensus means nothing apart from its majority design. Majority's are often wrong or ineffective and detailing the truth about poorly kept data.
            while i can't rember the exact numbers i know the thirty years war killed a higher percentage of the worlds population. with only melee weapons and very early guns too. 
        To be fair, that's why this game was called "Battlefield One" in the first place
i’ve heard 20th was most violent century
    During the 17th century century's 30 years war roughly 1/3rd the population of central europe died, in some places as much as 2/3rds was killed. By comparison WWII killed only about 3-4% of the world's population.
        there were about 200,000,000 deaths in 20th century from war and famine. there were about 3 billion people at the time in 1950 alone, so that is an upwards of 8% of the world population killed. 

            However by the end of the 20th century the population was 6 billion, so the % drops dramatically if you consider the whole century's deaths vs the population. However measuring deaths over such a time period can be inaccurate.

But, even going on your numbers. The Taiping Rebellion for instance has a death toll estimated to be up to 100,000,000 (though the real number is likely much lower) which represented at the very least 10% of the world's 1 billion population. All that from a single conflict. The Spanish/Portuguese Conquest of South America in the 16th century was even deadlier and likely the single most destructive event in human history. 
                [here’s something i found out of curiosity, the death % for population was greatest in 20th century](https://imgur.com/gallery/kfzdj) 
                    I'm sorry but whatever source that came from is pure bullshit, and looks kind of euro-centric. More people died in China in the 19th century than that list claims died in the whole world. The death toll in the Americas in the 16th century was likely over 100 million at the least and it claims only 1-2 million died. Even the death toll in just Europe during the 17th century exceeds what this list claims.
                        And many records from hundreds of years ago are bullshit too man. You have no actual way of verifying any of it.
> Truthfully, we are living in a practical golden age of peace. We really are lucky.

Until it ends, of course. 
You and me both man, would have been 20 in 1914 if I were born 100 years ago, ripe age to get shipped out to WWI
Yeah right I was born 100 years and six months after a certain Adolf Hitler
    ...Hitler fought in WW1.
    Which one?
    ?

If you were born in 1889 you would have been in WWI, and probably died.
Yeah. It seems like one of those things where he didn't want to go home in disgrace, and the higher ups kinda just let it slide. He definitely didn't deserve the post-humous promotion, but it was one of those feel good things to help the country heal.
    I'm wondering if it was suicide?

It had to be.  PTSD mixed with depression
        That's basically what it sounds like. Like suicide by cop, but with machine guns. It was Americans that told the story too, and even they said the Germans were trying to wave him off. As with most tragedies in war though, we will never know the full story.
Bent double, like old beggars under sacks, 

Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge, 

Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs, 

And towards our distant rest began to trudge. 

Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots, 

But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind; 

Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots 

Of gas-shells dropping softly behind. 


Gas! GAS! Quick, boys!—An ecstasy of fumbling 

Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time, 

But someone still was yelling out and stumbling 

And flound’ring like a man in fire or lime.—

Dim through the misty panes and thick green light, 

As under a green sea, I saw him drowning. 


In all my dreams before my helpless sight, 

He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning. 


If in some smothering dreams, you too could pace 

Behind the wagon that we flung him in, 

And watch the white eyes writhing in his face, 

His hanging face, like a devil’s sick of sin; 

If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood 

Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,

Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud 

Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,—

My friend, you would not tell with such high zest 

To children ardent for some desperate glory, 

The old Lie: Dulce et decorum est 

Pro patria mori.

*Dulce et Decorum Est*

*Wilfred OWEN*
    Holy shit. I can just picture the guy panicking to get his mask on, unable to do so as the gas envelops him...burning out his eyes, choking on his own lungs as they essentially dissolved inside him...

This is why gas was banned from all future wars after WWI. It was far too horrible a way to die.
        It was banned pre-ww1, including things such as Tear Gas, but none of the major European powers gave a shit. France were the first nation to use any form of gas warfare in WW1, prompting the Germans into developing something worse than Tear Gas.

Thus, modern biological warfare was born. 
The sad thing is, Wilfred Owen died during the war, a week before the armistice.
December 6th this year for Finland. 
    Too bad it doesn't exist
Not really. It is going to be a centennial of Polish independence after the partitions, not Poland in general.
So good! They're all good. 
    I just wish he had more on iTunes 
WW1 and with stories and quotes from all political sides. Also the brutality and goodness in all humans. The best narration I've listened to. 
He also has other historical periods and stories. One on Ghengis Khan is incredible too. 
Radiolab is another great podcast. It’s not about ww1 . But they cover a lot of different topics. A personal favorite of mine is called “the buried bodies case”.
Dan Carlin's Hardcore History pods are really good (also really, really long) basically narrations of a certain event, or set of events, or war. In depth, dramatic.

Not sure if they would be the first pod I'd recommend to someone (although was basically the first I've listened to. Started with his Prophets of Doom episode, FWIW).

Gotten really in to a lot of podcasts since then (about a year and a half ago), however. Got plenty of recommendations, depending what you are in to.
WW2 numbers are inflated.
I agree, this is exactly what makes the ending so utterly devastating. I hope they never reprise the roles in another series, the finality and total silence that has followed since we watched the characters go "over the top" is a poignant reminder of the human tragedy of the sacrifice made during the Great War. 
The amazing thing about it is that they screwed it up when they filmed it, so they had to create a new ending in post-production:

        such a senseless war 
Did they though? The record keeping from this age is not very good. Russia likes to say they lost like 30m plus in WW2 but no one actually believes that.
    France had better record keeping in WW1 then Russia in WW2.

We had proper military documents and service lists we can read and study.

Russia just finished its red purge and was not organized during ww2
        Every government including France will resort to propaganda to make themselves look better. Sure, I am not saying they were as bad as Russia lol. I just don't get remembrance days based on numbers alone. It comes off as cheesy to me. 

Definitely with WW2 in that those numbers are purely ridiculous on some levels. For Jews, Germans, and Russians. I don't believe any of the final numbers. Russia's are off the charts bullshit.

Still incredibly high mind you, more than anything else. It's just a pity everyone feels the need to lie about it.

    No there isn't.   They'd be over 118 years old by now

    Yes, paid day off.

In general, every year
        That’s fantastic! I’ve never heard of a single employer here in the UK doing that, and I have worked or have friends in a whole ton of professions
            I thought it was, my wife is from the UK and she said November 11 is for Remembrance Day so I assumed it would be a bank holiday like Canada
                No bank holiday, I  still work but we have silence at 11:00 for 5 minutes 
                    That's lame, canada gives us a full day off paid
                        We observed 100% silence for two minutes and I work in a call centre with 1000 other people. I was proud of my guys.
I'm still surprised people compare Bf and COD. They use two completely different styles. COD is an arcade shooter while Bf is a, well open battlefield shooter that has all sorts of vehicles.
    Honestly they are both great, and i love ww2. Its like when people compare CSGO and R6.
    The comparison is how much fun I have playing them both. And I don't have fun playing cod, but I do playing battlefield. There for, for me at least, battlefield is better than cod. 
COD gonna COD.

They found a model that was profitable and they will never, ever change it. 
    Cod... Cod never changes...
I've heard good things about the campaign, though.  Have you tried that?
    I heard the first thing that happens is you get off the boat in Normandy to PPSH fire from the Germans who have a mix of SS and Wehrmacht uniforms.
        So, I'm not too familiar with the details, but the PPSH was a Soviet gun, and you're saying there shouldn't be any SS uniforms, right?  Basically, you're criticizing the historical accuracy.
            Correct, and they shied away from displaying the swastika and used the iron cross instead.
                Lack of swastikas was in multiplayer only, I believe, which is understandable.  The campaign has them, as far as I know.
Because I love battlefield 1. 
The salt in unnecessary. 
it made me laugh lol
WW2 happened because of WW1 being such a pointless clusterfuck of just pure utter human stupidity. 
    Before the Armistice 99 years ago, parties on all sides knew round two was coming soon. It only took 21 years.  
    Dammit Europe
He didn't say anything about WW2

EDIT: I did a derp
    >sending 18 million young men to go die for no reason was something that should never happen again, and then it happened again and was even worse

That pretty much means WW2
        Oh, good point.
Is white flower a metaphor for something? Or a literal white flower?
    Read back up, it was a white feather. White feathers have traditionally been symbolic of cowardice (or peace, if being used as an anti-war slogan)
        Oh i see. Thats messed up
            Oh it's worse than that. Not only were people getting publicly shamed into enlisting, even soldiers on leave and discharged veterans were getting harassed.
                Male privilege tho, amirite
                Damn that sucks. Was it like that in america?
People would still join to fight for their country or to get out of their hometown. 
    That's not the point. The point is how many fewer people would enlist. 
        The majority of Veterans I know joined for economic reasons: GI bill, training, lack of opportunities in a small rural town.

The rest joined because of family tradition, except that one fucktard that just wanted to kill people.
            I know one in high school who joined just to kill. 
                I know a few from my high school who said the same. I guess they think its gonna all play out like a game of call of duty or something. 
                    Ya it’s just fucking crazy man. 
                    If you get a chance to talk to someone that's combat arms in the Army, it's a fairly common mindset. We know it's not like CoD, but our job is to take ground and kill the enemy, and we embrace it.
                        Thats one thing. Its another thing to be a kid in high school who hasnt even had a taste of this combat and say they already love it. What about when they’re on the receiving end of the ass kicking?
                            Oh yeah, there's a huge difference. Those kids that talk big usually go for a desk job and act all badass. Or cooks lol
            I saw a reddit post earlier for a certain US military branch, where well over half the enlisted personnel did it for economic reasons. Its fucked, you shouldn't have to hold a rifle and go to a foreign land to fight a war to get university education and health care. 
The poor fight for the rich. And it has always been this way... 
    They destroy and they also build for the rich
Depends on branch and MOS
Why do people get so mad over millennials? People seem to think it's fine to throw blanket statements everywhere that fits their mindset.
    Millennials is just a cover for "the young generation is bad".

It's like the people using it know how retarded and senile that idea is, because the elders also said it about their made up generation, but now they try really hard to justify doing the same, while destracting with giving that generation  a specific name.
    Because its rare I’ve spoken with one who’s opinions aren’t shaped by social media & pop culture rather than actual real life experience.
        It's rare that I've spoken to an older generation that isn't influenced by social media either. That doesn't mean that entire generation is bad.
            Of course not. Not saying the whole generation is "bad". 
You seem to have misunderstood his comment. 
    Sorry, I don't agree. 

People who have never been to any form of Remembrance Day ceremony to get a real idea of what it's about. To speak with the families and people there. It's not a celebration of war in the slightest. It's the exact opposite of that but focuses on why some of these wars were unavoidable.

It's very different to the portrayal you get on social media where the Poppy and Union Jack are being used to push a right wing agenda. 

I hear this same sentiment from people all the time. Usually from people in their early 20s or younger. Many can even hold a straight face and make out that WWI / WWII could have been avoided from a British perspective, which just isn't true. 




        > It's not a celebration of war in the slightest.

I attended my town's Remembrance Day ceremony today. The speaker asked us to remember and celebrate all past, present, and future military members and all they have done. I support the holiday, and will continue to do so. Sayings it's not a celebration is wrong though. 

We remember those that fell (or will in the future) while also celebrating the country's goals and achievements won.
        He's not talking about Remembrance Day ceremonies though. You've misread his entire comment and become offended over nothing.  
            I'm not offended. And yes he is talking about Remembrance Day.

 I think it's you that seems to be a bit confused here. 

"Living in the UK it just feels very hard to think that Remembrance Day hasn't turned into a patriotic pro-war day of drivel."

Why I mentioned the ceremonies which show you what it's actually about, far more than social media / pop culture will. 

                He clearly wasn't talking about ceremonies.

Turn on the news and you get a better picture.
                Yes but the ceremonies are not the only part of the day, he's very clearly talking about the more modern aspects of Remembrance Day. Not just the ceremonies. 

Remembrance Day ceremonies have always been very tasteful and somber events that highlight the horrors of war. What op is talking about though is the corporate and political highjacking of days like today. Very clear difference. 
                War is stupid and most of them volunteered to go there. So whatever happened after that, it's on them. This is not a video game, you sign up for the possibility of DYING in DAY ONE. There's no jobs about? Well fucking move somewhere else then.
                    Some people are born warriors and soldiers. Doesn't mean it's not on them, but doesn't mean their deaths don't mean anything. No need to disrespect just because you don't agree.
                        in the grand scheme of things, let's just say that the Vietnam war deaths don't mean absolutely anything. 
the point 










your head
I think you're generalizing just a tad there, son. 
No I agree with this ...

It's sometimes if the world I live in , no one cares about all the sacrifices that happened ... The world isn't a perfect place , and to think that what we have today isn't because millions died .. 

I don't know what to say to those people . Wish the world didn't have a need for conflict and war :/

Their comment rings true with a lot of public sentiment in the Commonwealth after the First World War. People went in cheering for war and came out broken. 

The shift in ideas, art, politics, etc., was huge. PM Chamberlain lived through the First World War and knew how horrible it was, affecting his own politics. Why do you think Britain and France were so willing to let Nazi Germany get away with a lot of shit early on? They knew what total war in that age would bring. 

You should get some historical context yourself.

            Have you considered it's not trolling, per se? Obviously, I'm trolling you right here and now, but at the same time, all the lurkers that wouldn't have said anything did, in fact, pay respects. Not to mention, the top comment is about how absurd and terrible the death toll really is. 

So yeah. You can say the thread is shit, and that's your opinion, but it isn't. It still serves the same purpose, which is to remind us of what was supposed to be the war to end all wars, but only marks the beginning of an exceptionally bloody period in history, and a race for power fueled by military expansion: the end, and beginning, of an era. 

So, tl:dr, just because people don't pour their hearts out doesn't mean they don't get it. 
    I think it's great,   

I was expecting this post to get about 16 upvotes total.   

Seams like there's a lot of respect here actually 
Dammit, wrong game
     Don't sweat it. 
X or Square if you're on Xbox or PS4 (respectively)
very least they could do a dog tag marking the day. just sumthing to mark it. they could have done a message as you logged on like they do for lots of things. but to do nothing just seems so wrong. 

    Yeah that would have been decent. 
Have the game display a poppy on 11/11/18 for a whole day
Thanks!
If your friends or family members died and you decided to make a post on the internet would you want people to type F? It's a meme - typing F is making a mockery of a terrible event that wiped out almost an entire generation of young men, not including civilian deaths.
    I served in the military for 3 years, even served with a guy who was killed in Afghanistan.   My great  uncle was killed at the Somme.

I'd rather them have them take 2 seconds out of their day to pay respects in their own way.   If gamers want to press f then I'll thank them for it.  Going to the Ceremony and laying a poppy isn't for everyone.
    This is a video gaming subreddit on the internet, not your local cenotaph.
    Yes because we experienced this and we are responsible for the war. I don't believe those inflated numbers anyway.
        You need to do some reading then. 
It's my favourite actually 
    Why tho?? It’s so poorly designed. All the action is focused on B, which is a two-level corner/balcony camp-fest clusterfuck. Basically all you need to win is to hold that flag and either A or C and you’ve won. Hell, I’ve won just by holding the B flag and out killing the other team. 
        Because it's always a slaughter for the attacking side.   It's futile going after B.

It makes me think that's a real taste of WW1.   Doomed attacks that do nothing, a slaughter and wasted lives for nothing taken.    When you view it like that and that you won't win it's a fun experience.
Really sad that Blueprint for Armageddon isn't going to be free when the next episode comes out 
    Doesn't it only cost s couplr bucks anyway
        I mean yeah
            Just paid 10 bucks for episodes 34 to 39 on Rome. Dis gon b gud
    On one hand, yes it sucks, but i have no problems paying for his stuff.  One of the only few i will do that for...  

All of his paid podcasts are *so* worth it
Already seen that video at least 10 times because I love it so much. Very powerful and sad but interesting at the same time. 
    I had to go watch it again after your comment then I decided I should share just in case someone hasn't seen it. He has one on nuclear war that was uploaded pretty recently as well. 
        The graphic presentation, especially that transfer from German Western Front casualties to the Eastern Front, and then specifically for Stalingrad, gave me goosebumps. 
            The way the soviets kept... on... ticking... it was horrifying. It opened my eyes to the fact that the Germans saw their fight against the soviets as the main fight. It was a fight for survival for both sides. The bloodiest a war can be.
                I've seen the statistics before but it's hard to really comprehend the scale. Seeing it displayed like this is helpful, and horrifying.
                There’s always that gut wrenching disgust at the lives lost on Normandy D-day invasion for me because of how well that scene as been adapted to media like Saving Pvt Ryan and Medal of Honor. 

But all those deaths are peanuts compared to Stalingrad. That’s not even innocent civilians either. :-/
                It just keeps going up...and up....and up.
                It was a war of extermination. 
            Makes me wonder what would have happened if they stayed allied .
[deleted]
    Same here. My mother immigrated from Poland in 1976. My paternal grandfather was a POW after the Soviets took him to fight, he escaped and tried to walk back across the German front. He spent six years as a POW. What I would like to know is how many of those Polish deaths were by Soviets.
    I often think of this ... It is scary .
Thank you for sharing this. 
The Eastern Front was literally hell on earth to those who were involved. Germany and its allies suffered a terrible toll against the Soviets. The Soviets bled the most out of all the countries involved in the war. WWII was a terrible nightmare.
Holy fuck i never realized how devastating WWII was for the soviets. That counter kept going and going. 
    Yeah that was the biggest shock for me too, even with all the projects and research I did in school on the pacific theater.
        And to be fair. School history never did a good job of talking about the eastern front. I only recall learning about Stalingrad maybe twice throughout junior high and high school. This video is great at creating a picture for how devastation it was for the Soviets. 
            Post-cold war propaganda and relationships has our society pretty adverse to recognizing the Soviets efforts in the war and how they far surpassed our own. 

We're pretty afraid to display that without them...there was absolutely no chance of saving western europe. 
                My school barely even spoke about the world wars. History education in England is embarrassing. I can honestly say anything I know about history is because I went out and learnt it myself. Worrying to think about the amount of people that are completely unaware of the scale of the world wars.
This is one of the best videos ive ever seen. Thank you for sharing it. 
Damn good share.

Seriously hope someone dubs that into german. That's exactly the type of video that can be shown in history class and we keep lacking good, short and compressible content like that. 

If any history teacher is reading this, do your best to translate this. Never ever seen WW2 being put into a perspective like that before and this adds so much to the horror and story of that war.
Thanks for this. Never seen this before. The numbers were so staggering I cried. 
*Holy shit the Russian dead....*
Thanks for that link. Really interesting stuff!
Not even remotely close, 70-80 million died in WW2 compared to 18 million in WW1. Unless the population jumped 6x, that doesn’t make sense. 
    70-80 million is probably the total amount of deaths from ww2, but not soldier related. Could be the difference
        Even then it doesn't make sense. The world population only increased about 30% during that time period. Meanwhile soldier deaths in WW1 were about 8~ million, and soldier deaths in WW2 were anywhere from 17-25 million. 
            It was 18 million,  not 8
                15-18 million is the upper total, including civilians. About 8 million soldiers died, and anywhere from 5-10 million civilians died, mostly in Russia and the Ottoman Empire. 
    WW2 added terror bombing, China, industrial genocide, famine, new technologies, two tyrants, total war, 2 more years, new fronts but none of that should detract from the fact that all wars are horrific
        Only 2 tyrants?
Oh one humanity?
    not looking for accuracy just looking for funny simplicity

        Dummkopf
Fun fact, Hitler wasn't a big beer drinker. But to appeal to German voters he would often be photographed with a beer stein at his table.
    Not a big beer drinker!? Man, the more I hear about this Hitler bloke, the less i like him.
        Someone should really stop that guy.
Every time someone brings up WW2, people start with the damn Genocide Olympics.
    I had a classmate like that in school. I was taking a class on Operation Barbarossa and my classmate saw me reading Geoffrey Megargee's War of Annihilation. He pushed aside my book and said "If you think that's bad, you should look up what King Leopold did in the Congo."

I don't understand the fetish of trying to out-genocide things. 
        my dad killed more people than your dad!!
        Many people try to use it to deflect guilt, or to prove that an enemy is worse than you think. 
            whataboutism
                Whataboutism is used as deflection when criticizing someone. 

“Russia has committed numerous civil rights atrocities”

“What about America? You are lynching negroes” 

Is the classic example. 

    Well with how active the soc dem and red black communities are on reddit, it’s kinda helpful to remember how much agony that ideology brought to the world. 
That’s a much different story considering 90% of those deaths were from famines, and only really the holondor can be DIRECTLY attributed to malice in this situation. 

It’s just disingenuous to compare Hitler to Stalin or maos death toll. Hitler killed 28 million damn soviets in JUST the invasions of the ussr. Just to compare the brutality of both, Hitler killed 6 million polish people in his invasion of Poland in 1939. The soviets in comparison left 350,000 dead. It’s just an entirely different scale of genocide which was enabled. 

I am no communist nor do I have sympathies with the ussr, but I hate how westerners warp this stuff. 
    I didn't attribute it to malice; I attributed it to Communism,  which can be given *direct* attribution for famine. And I, a "Westerner", didn't come up with these numbers. I was pulling from Solzhenitsyn. So I'm not sure your identity politics plays here. And the 80+ million doesn't include WWII deaths.

EDIT: I'm not even sure I get the point your point.
        Sort of sort. For instance when the great famine hit China, it was caused by failing infrastructure by 25 years of war and natural disasters. Mao implemented policies to relive the famine (killing birds etc) but ended up causing more problems. It’s debatable whether this would have happened with communism or not, and the 1959-1963 famine which killed 40 million wasn’t too different from pre communist famines. 

The ussr was a bit different. They weaponized famine against populations they didn’t like, mostly Ukrainians. When famine and drought hit in 1933, they specifically did not send help to relieve the famine in Ukraine and took their food to punish the Ukrainians. But the overall famine of the era was caused by natural disasters for the most part, it was pretty normal for famine to erupt every decade or two in the region. 
I get your point, but to imply capitalism doesn't give us similar numbers is crazy
    I just want to play games 
        Then go play my son, play to hearts content or until you get in trouble. Whichever comes first
    Is it? I think your ignorant of the horrendous conditions instantiated in and by communist states.
        I️ think you’re probably ignorant of the conditions that Britain imposed on its colonies, forcing India to produce cash crops in times of famine that killed ended up killing millions of people, to give a single example.
            I thought you were talking about Capitalism, but now you're referencing the terrors of Imperialism... I can't say I follow.

                WW1 and 2 could both be argued to be capitalistic wars. Germany slid down the path of Nazism due to the economic hardship resulting from a capitalist economy crash. Also cant forget all of the manufacturers and rich war barons, whom profited from both wars and millions of deaths. Also see multiple other wars and injustices done in capitalist countries and you'll realise the system isn't the problem, it's always who leads at the end.
                    Lolwut. Germany didn't fall into economic depression because capitalism, they did so because the Treaty of Versailles fucked them sideways economically and they had no way to pay reparations besides printing money.

And while people made nauseating amounts of money off the world wars, it's more than a bit of a stretch to call them "capitalist wars"
                        Well Germany didn't lose its economy due to a single reason at that time, the Rhineland was occupied and the reparations were fair but harsh, i agree, but the great depression, which jumpstarted the hyperinflation of Germany, as well as strong state ownership was capitalistic in nature,.
It IS a stretch, because whether Communism or capitalism, the deaths of millions on either side was due to humans, the ability to do evil isn't tied to economical models. This is why i tried to grossly point that out with that argument, I dislike seeing red-scare type of comments used as meme, kills potential discussion.
                    Germany didn’t go to Nazism because of a capitalist crash. The treaty of Versailles put the blame of the war on them even though all of Europe was ready to throw punches at the start of the war. Hell, people were asking to forgive Germany’s supposed dent to Europe because they knew it would eventually lead to another war and guess what happened? Why do you think the US helped offset parts of the cost of the war and rebuilding following the war? 
And that's nothing compared to how many people have died of Malaria!
I have no clue why you were downvoted lol
    Because it doesn't compare. People dying "due to communism" is a bullshit statistic in and off itself, but it's especially shitty when compared to people dying in war, i.e killing each other. 
    because this statistic is made up from the debunked black book of communism
    They weren't REAL Communists!!!


/s
        That's cause real communism isn't possible. No country has ever followed Marx's process to communism, it's just not going to happen. 

            >  Marx's process to communism

lol you say that like it's some step by step recipe by the chef Karlito Marks
            And it's not going to, unless humans change fundamentally. Marxs idea of communism is almost too utopian for me. 
                Why? It’s basically the fundamentalism of lesser human mind. “I need more free stuff, others should give it to me”
                    That's exactly the mindset of a capitalist in Marx's works, well done understanding it.
                        So basically it’s a literature work of projection, zero responsibility and all control of wealth through the nanny state. It has 0 to do with capitalism and free market in real world though.
            The kibbutz system in Israel was pretty close.

I agree though. The economy is to complicated to plan, it's best to let it just happen organically
                economies need intervention, no such thing as an entirely "organic" economy
    Very easy, it doesn't matter to the current story. Gotten pretty annoying on reddit that some people somehow think it's necessary to daily fearmonger about communism as if the proletariat is planning to revolt next tuesday and implement some archaic economic-political system that failed more times than you got finger on your hands. 

Not to mention the whole number is misleading, obviously communism isn't a person cutting millions of peoples throats, nor did eg the soviets ever commit genocide, nor did that many people actually starve, but that's another story that really doesn't belong here.

Or the basic idea that it's fucking retarded to use the remembrance of a tragedy far in the past, on reddit of all places, as some political gunpowder against imaginary opponents. 
    Because no one asked. Think.
    You really don't? Have you seen how many openly communist users reddit has? It's sickening.

Edit: the downvotes prove my point.
        Don't worry, they will keep growing.

                Isnt that always the excuse though? Communism doesnt work because your relying on humans who hold power to be fair. 
                    It is a universal excuse for every system. There's no perfect socialism capitalism or communism.  Not one system is better, and none is ever perfectly implemented due to humans. Simply blaming Venezuela's situation to socialism is not looking at the big picture is all I wanted to tell him.

            Then you can compare the deaths of these individual wars to other wars, e.g WW2, and it would be an appropriate comparison. Counting vague nonsense numbers as "deaths by communism" and putting them against deaths in certain wars is fucking stupid. 
            And capitalism has caused victims of war all over the Middle East and Central America, but again, this isn’t the time or place. To be clear, communism is a terrible and harmful system, but that doesn’t mean I’m always looking for an opportunity to shit on it. Know your place.

World War II was the deadliest military conflict in history in absolute terms of total casualties. Over 60 million people were killed, which was about 3% of the 1940 world population (est. 2.3 billion). Statistics of military wounded are available for the major combatants.

And that's why modern governments flip their shit when a possible pandemic arises.  

Presuming a comparable death toll, we could be looking at 400 million dead, with a much higher ceiling given the poverty, population density, and already overtaxed medical services in places like India or China.

It's a testament to mankind's fear of contagion that we stand guard against something no one in living memory has experienced.

Until a few years ago AIDS was killing two million africans every year. I think we got plenty reminder as to how dangerous disease can get.
        Thats a preventable condition that is not spread due to contact but ignorance and risky behaivor... big difference
            Yup.  
Also called the "Spanish Flu."
    Somehow I'm sure the spanish got another name for it :\^)
        Royal Flu. We are very proud of it.
            Very progressive.
        Probably 'Catalan Flu'.
Apparently it didn't work.
Or a syringe!
Actual wars really really aren't. War in general is wasted resources by any definition. It is lucrative for certain people to have small conflicts.
    It is incredibly lucrative for certain people...lots of things are "wasted resources" that make certain people lots of money.
    The military industrial complex though
    It depends. WWI and II massively damaged the economies of Britain, France, Germany, Russia etc., whereas America made billions out of them.
I always imagine that feeling is like being a medic, running up to a fallen soldier and realizing there's nothing you can do to help.  The BF version 
    It's more like running up to a fallen soldier that you could easily save, but then he shoots himself 🕺
        I wonder if that actually happened in the WW's.
I'm actually a medic 95% of the time.  Just think there should be more of us.   It's an unstoppable wave when you have 5 medics in a squad 
    Most of my score is just because of this cycle (revive, supres fire, drop med crate, repeat) there have been times I've had mvp in a match with a 9-25 K/D
        Same I'm normally in the top 3 on my team every match just doing this.
            I would love a squad of just medics. 5 medics running like a wave of unstoppable death... Untill we run out of ammo at least.
                And that’s when the support squad comes in! A maelstrom of bullets!
    Not having medics is probably the leading cause of losses in operations, aside from having too many scouts. A well balanced team could probably win a vast majority of operations, regardless of overall skill. 
        My dream is to have a full team of medics who all heal
            But who's gonna deal with the tanks that roll up? Then you'd need medics with rifle grenades. 
                One good assault.
                    And a Support with Ammo pouches to quickly resupply the Assault.
 
And one scout with spotting flares, the support should also resupply this scout so that he keeps the enemies lighted up.  
  
Now that's a dream team.
                        Yeah. There should be one of everything with ptfo loadouts and the rest medics. I don't understand why people don't abuse the hell out of the medic class. You've got Jesus' best superpowers ffs
What happens when we run out of poor nations to proxy with?
    We'll fight proxy wars within another country. 
    Cold wars in cyberspace.
You’re right it is pretty much considered the ‘first war’ of modern times 
    And I was just checking back, but holy shit, while the napoleonic wars caused ~6 million deaths, the thirty years war caused ~8 millions deaths almost 200 years earlier.

The latter one being with a much lower population density and mostly limited to the holy roman empire's grounds. That's fucking terrifying. Oo
        Record keeping from these days is ALWAYS suspect dude.
            Of course it is, and historians know that too. And there is a consensus that parts of germany were depopulated by those conflicts, so those numbers might not be so unrealistic.
                Not all historians are truth seeking people.
                    That's why you check on the consensus.
                        That's why a consensus means nothing apart from its majority design. Majority's are often wrong or ineffective and detailing the truth about poorly kept data.
        while i can't rember the exact numbers i know the thirty years war killed a higher percentage of the worlds population. with only melee weapons and very early guns too. 
    To be fair, that's why this game was called "Battlefield One" in the first place
During the 17th century century's 30 years war roughly 1/3rd the population of central europe died, in some places as much as 2/3rds was killed. By comparison WWII killed only about 3-4% of the world's population.
    there were about 200,000,000 deaths in 20th century from war and famine. there were about 3 billion people at the time in 1950 alone, so that is an upwards of 8% of the world population killed. 

        However by the end of the 20th century the population was 6 billion, so the % drops dramatically if you consider the whole century's deaths vs the population. However measuring deaths over such a time period can be inaccurate.

But, even going on your numbers. The Taiping Rebellion for instance has a death toll estimated to be up to 100,000,000 (though the real number is likely much lower) which represented at the very least 10% of the world's 1 billion population. All that from a single conflict. The Spanish/Portuguese Conquest of South America in the 16th century was even deadlier and likely the single most destructive event in human history. 
            [here’s something i found out of curiosity, the death % for population was greatest in 20th century](https://imgur.com/gallery/kfzdj) 
                I'm sorry but whatever source that came from is pure bullshit, and looks kind of euro-centric. More people died in China in the 19th century than that list claims died in the whole world. The death toll in the Americas in the 16th century was likely over 100 million at the least and it claims only 1-2 million died. Even the death toll in just Europe during the 17th century exceeds what this list claims.
                    And many records from hundreds of years ago are bullshit too man. You have no actual way of verifying any of it.
...Hitler fought in WW1.
Which one?
?

If you were born in 1889 you would have been in WWI, and probably died.
I'm wondering if it was suicide?

It had to be.  PTSD mixed with depression
    That's basically what it sounds like. Like suicide by cop, but with machine guns. It was Americans that told the story too, and even they said the Germans were trying to wave him off. As with most tragedies in war though, we will never know the full story.
Holy shit. I can just picture the guy panicking to get his mask on, unable to do so as the gas envelops him...burning out his eyes, choking on his own lungs as they essentially dissolved inside him...

This is why gas was banned from all future wars after WWI. It was far too horrible a way to die.
    It was banned pre-ww1, including things such as Tear Gas, but none of the major European powers gave a shit. France were the first nation to use any form of gas warfare in WW1, prompting the Germans into developing something worse than Tear Gas.

Thus, modern biological warfare was born.

    such a senseless war 
France had better record keeping in WW1 then Russia in WW2.

We had proper military documents and service lists we can read and study.

Russia just finished its red purge and was not organized during ww2
    Every government including France will resort to propaganda to make themselves look better. Sure, I am not saying they were as bad as Russia lol. I just don't get remembrance days based on numbers alone. It comes off as cheesy to me. 

Definitely with WW2 in that those numbers are purely ridiculous on some levels. For Jews, Germans, and Russians. I don't believe any of the final numbers. Russia's are off the charts bullshit.

Still incredibly high mind you, more than anything else. It's just a pity everyone feels the need to lie about it.
No there isn't.   They'd be over 118 years old by now
    Your right the guy I was thinking of passed in 2012 
Yes, paid day off.

In general, every year
    That’s fantastic! I’ve never heard of a single employer here in the UK doing that, and I have worked or have friends in a whole ton of professions
        I thought it was, my wife is from the UK and she said November 11 is for Remembrance Day so I assumed it would be a bank holiday like Canada
            No bank holiday, I  still work but we have silence at 11:00 for 5 minutes 
                That's lame, canada gives us a full day off paid
                    We observed 100% silence for two minutes and I work in a call centre with 1000 other people. I was proud of my guys.
Honestly they are both great, and i love ww2. Its like when people compare CSGO and R6.
The comparison is how much fun I have playing them both. And I don't have fun playing cod, but I do playing battlefield. There for, for me at least, battlefield is better than cod. 
Cod... Cod never changes...
I heard the first thing that happens is you get off the boat in Normandy to PPSH fire from the Germans who have a mix of SS and Wehrmacht uniforms.
    So, I'm not too familiar with the details, but the PPSH was a Soviet gun, and you're saying there shouldn't be any SS uniforms, right?  Basically, you're criticizing the historical accuracy.
        Correct, and they shied away from displaying the swastika and used the iron cross instead.
            Lack of swastikas was in multiplayer only, I believe, which is understandable.  The campaign has them, as far as I know.
Before the Armistice 99 years ago, parties on all sides knew round two was coming soon. It only took 21 years.  
Dammit Europe
>sending 18 million young men to go die for no reason was something that should never happen again, and then it happened again and was even worse

That pretty much means WW2
    Oh, good point.
Read back up, it was a white feather. White feathers have traditionally been symbolic of cowardice (or peace, if being used as an anti-war slogan)
    Oh i see. Thats messed up
        Oh it's worse than that. Not only were people getting publicly shamed into enlisting, even soldiers on leave and discharged veterans were getting harassed.
            Male privilege tho, amirite
            Damn that sucks. Was it like that in america?
That's not the point. The point is how many fewer people would enlist. 
    The majority of Veterans I know joined for economic reasons: GI bill, training, lack of opportunities in a small rural town.

The rest joined because of family tradition, except that one fucktard that just wanted to kill people.
        I know one in high school who joined just to kill. 
            I know a few from my high school who said the same. I guess they think its gonna all play out like a game of call of duty or something. 
                Ya it’s just fucking crazy man. 
                If you get a chance to talk to someone that's combat arms in the Army, it's a fairly common mindset. We know it's not like CoD, but our job is to take ground and kill the enemy, and we embrace it.
                    Thats one thing. Its another thing to be a kid in high school who hasnt even had a taste of this combat and say they already love it. What about when they’re on the receiving end of the ass kicking?
                        Oh yeah, there's a huge difference. Those kids that talk big usually go for a desk job and act all badass. Or cooks lol
        I saw a reddit post earlier for a certain US military branch, where well over half the enlisted personnel did it for economic reasons. Its fucked, you shouldn't have to hold a rifle and go to a foreign land to fight a war to get university education and health care. 
They destroy and they also build for the rich
Millennials is just a cover for "the young generation is bad".

It's like the people using it know how retarded and senile that idea is, because the elders also said it about their made up generation, but now they try really hard to justify doing the same, while destracting with giving that generation  a specific name.
Because its rare I’ve spoken with one who’s opinions aren’t shaped by social media & pop culture rather than actual real life experience.
    It's rare that I've spoken to an older generation that isn't influenced by social media either. That doesn't mean that entire generation is bad.
        Of course not. Not saying the whole generation is "bad". 
Sorry, I don't agree. 

People who have never been to any form of Remembrance Day ceremony to get a real idea of what it's about. To speak with the families and people there. It's not a celebration of war in the slightest. It's the exact opposite of that but focuses on why some of these wars were unavoidable.

It's very different to the portrayal you get on social media where the Poppy and Union Jack are being used to push a right wing agenda. 

I hear this same sentiment from people all the time. Usually from people in their early 20s or younger. Many can even hold a straight face and make out that WWI / WWII could have been avoided from a British perspective, which just isn't true. 




    > It's not a celebration of war in the slightest.

I attended my town's Remembrance Day ceremony today. The speaker asked us to remember and celebrate all past, present, and future military members and all they have done. I support the holiday, and will continue to do so. Sayings it's not a celebration is wrong though. 

We remember those that fell (or will in the future) while also celebrating the country's goals and achievements won.
    He's not talking about Remembrance Day ceremonies though. You've misread his entire comment and become offended over nothing.  
        I'm not offended. And yes he is talking about Remembrance Day.

 I think it's you that seems to be a bit confused here. 

"Living in the UK it just feels very hard to think that Remembrance Day hasn't turned into a patriotic pro-war day of drivel."

Why I mentioned the ceremonies which show you what it's actually about, far more than social media / pop culture will. 

            He clearly wasn't talking about ceremonies.

Turn on the news and you get a better picture.
            Yes but the ceremonies are not the only part of the day, he's very clearly talking about the more modern aspects of Remembrance Day. Not just the ceremonies. 

Remembrance Day ceremonies have always been very tasteful and somber events that highlight the horrors of war. What op is talking about though is the corporate and political highjacking of days like today. Very clear difference. 
            War is stupid and most of them volunteered to go there. So whatever happened after that, it's on them. This is not a video game, you sign up for the possibility of DYING in DAY ONE. There's no jobs about? Well fucking move somewhere else then.
                Some people are born warriors and soldiers. Doesn't mean it's not on them, but doesn't mean their deaths don't mean anything. No need to disrespect just because you don't agree.
                    in the grand scheme of things, let's just say that the Vietnam war deaths don't mean absolutely anything. 
>If a WW3 ever happens,...

You say that as if we aren't currently teetering on the edge of it...

        Have you considered it's not trolling, per se? Obviously, I'm trolling you right here and now, but at the same time, all the lurkers that wouldn't have said anything did, in fact, pay respects. Not to mention, the top comment is about how absurd and terrible the death toll really is. 

So yeah. You can say the thread is shit, and that's your opinion, but it isn't. It still serves the same purpose, which is to remind us of what was supposed to be the war to end all wars, but only marks the beginning of an exceptionally bloody period in history, and a race for power fueled by military expansion: the end, and beginning, of an era. 

So, tl:dr, just because people don't pour their hearts out doesn't mean they don't get it. 
I think it's great,   

I was expecting this post to get about 16 upvotes total.   

Seams like there's a lot of respect here actually 
 Don't sweat it. 
Yeah that would have been decent. 
I served in the military for 3 years, even served with a guy who was killed in Afghanistan.   My great  uncle was killed at the Somme.

I'd rather them have them take 2 seconds out of their day to pay respects in their own way.   If gamers want to press f then I'll thank them for it.  Going to the Ceremony and laying a poppy isn't for everyone.
This is a video gaming subreddit on the internet, not your local cenotaph.
Yes because we experienced this and we are responsible for the war. I don't believe those inflated numbers anyway.
    You need to do some reading then. 
Why tho?? It’s so poorly designed. All the action is focused on B, which is a two-level corner/balcony camp-fest clusterfuck. Basically all you need to win is to hold that flag and either A or C and you’ve won. Hell, I’ve won just by holding the B flag and out killing the other team. 
    Because it's always a slaughter for the attacking side.   It's futile going after B.

It makes me think that's a real taste of WW1.   Doomed attacks that do nothing, a slaughter and wasted lives for nothing taken.    When you view it like that and that you won't win it's a fun experience.
Doesn't it only cost s couplr bucks anyway
    I mean yeah
        Just paid 10 bucks for episodes 34 to 39 on Rome. Dis gon b gud
On one hand, yes it sucks, but i have no problems paying for his stuff.  One of the only few i will do that for...  

All of his paid podcasts are *so* worth it
I had to go watch it again after your comment then I decided I should share just in case someone hasn't seen it. He has one on nuclear war that was uploaded pretty recently as well. 
    The graphic presentation, especially that transfer from German Western Front casualties to the Eastern Front, and then specifically for Stalingrad, gave me goosebumps. 
        The way the soviets kept... on... ticking... it was horrifying. It opened my eyes to the fact that the Germans saw their fight against the soviets as the main fight. It was a fight for survival for both sides. The bloodiest a war can be.
            I've seen the statistics before but it's hard to really comprehend the scale. Seeing it displayed like this is helpful, and horrifying.
            There’s always that gut wrenching disgust at the lives lost on Normandy D-day invasion for me because of how well that scene as been adapted to media like Saving Pvt Ryan and Medal of Honor. 

But all those deaths are peanuts compared to Stalingrad. That’s not even innocent civilians either. :-/
            It just keeps going up...and up....and up.
            It was a war of extermination. 
        Makes me wonder what would have happened if they stayed allied .
Same here. My mother immigrated from Poland in 1976. My paternal grandfather was a POW after the Soviets took him to fight, he escaped and tried to walk back across the German front. He spent six years as a POW. What I would like to know is how many of those Polish deaths were by Soviets.
I often think of this ... It is scary .
Yeah that was the biggest shock for me too, even with all the projects and research I did in school on the pacific theater.
    And to be fair. School history never did a good job of talking about the eastern front. I only recall learning about Stalingrad maybe twice throughout junior high and high school. This video is great at creating a picture for how devastation it was for the Soviets. 
        Post-cold war propaganda and relationships has our society pretty adverse to recognizing the Soviets efforts in the war and how they far surpassed our own. 

We're pretty afraid to display that without them...there was absolutely no chance of saving western europe. 
            My school barely even spoke about the world wars. History education in England is embarrassing. I can honestly say anything I know about history is because I went out and learnt it myself. Worrying to think about the amount of people that are completely unaware of the scale of the world wars.
70-80 million is probably the total amount of deaths from ww2, but not soldier related. Could be the difference
    Even then it doesn't make sense. The world population only increased about 30% during that time period. Meanwhile soldier deaths in WW1 were about 8~ million, and soldier deaths in WW2 were anywhere from 17-25 million. 
        It was 18 million,  not 8
            15-18 million is the upper total, including civilians. About 8 million soldiers died, and anywhere from 5-10 million civilians died, mostly in Russia and the Ottoman Empire. 
WW2 added terror bombing, China, industrial genocide, famine, new technologies, two tyrants, total war, 2 more years, new fronts but none of that should detract from the fact that all wars are horrific
    Only 2 tyrants?
not looking for accuracy just looking for funny simplicity

    Dummkopf
Not a big beer drinker!? Man, the more I hear about this Hitler bloke, the less i like him.
    Someone should really stop that guy.
I had a classmate like that in school. I was taking a class on Operation Barbarossa and my classmate saw me reading Geoffrey Megargee's War of Annihilation. He pushed aside my book and said "If you think that's bad, you should look up what King Leopold did in the Congo."

I don't understand the fetish of trying to out-genocide things. 
    my dad killed more people than your dad!!
    Many people try to use it to deflect guilt, or to prove that an enemy is worse than you think. 
        whataboutism
            Whataboutism is used as deflection when criticizing someone. 

“Russia has committed numerous civil rights atrocities”

“What about America? You are lynching negroes” 

Is the classic example. 

Well with how active the soc dem and red black communities are on reddit, it’s kinda helpful to remember how much agony that ideology brought to the world. 
I didn't attribute it to malice; I attributed it to Communism,  which can be given *direct* attribution for famine. And I, a "Westerner", didn't come up with these numbers. I was pulling from Solzhenitsyn. So I'm not sure your identity politics plays here. And the 80+ million doesn't include WWII deaths.

EDIT: I'm not even sure I get the point your point.
    Sort of sort. For instance when the great famine hit China, it was caused by failing infrastructure by 25 years of war and natural disasters. Mao implemented policies to relive the famine (killing birds etc) but ended up causing more problems. It’s debatable whether this would have happened with communism or not, and the 1959-1963 famine which killed 40 million wasn’t too different from pre communist famines. 

The ussr was a bit different. They weaponized famine against populations they didn’t like, mostly Ukrainians. When famine and drought hit in 1933, they specifically did not send help to relieve the famine in Ukraine and took their food to punish the Ukrainians. But the overall famine of the era was caused by natural disasters for the most part, it was pretty normal for famine to erupt every decade or two in the region. 
I just want to play games 
    Then go play my son, play to hearts content or until you get in trouble. Whichever comes first
Is it? I think your ignorant of the horrendous conditions instantiated in and by communist states.
    I️ think you’re probably ignorant of the conditions that Britain imposed on its colonies, forcing India to produce cash crops in times of famine that killed ended up killing millions of people, to give a single example.
        I thought you were talking about Capitalism, but now you're referencing the terrors of Imperialism... I can't say I follow.

            WW1 and 2 could both be argued to be capitalistic wars. Germany slid down the path of Nazism due to the economic hardship resulting from a capitalist economy crash. Also cant forget all of the manufacturers and rich war barons, whom profited from both wars and millions of deaths. Also see multiple other wars and injustices done in capitalist countries and you'll realise the system isn't the problem, it's always who leads at the end.
                Lolwut. Germany didn't fall into economic depression because capitalism, they did so because the Treaty of Versailles fucked them sideways economically and they had no way to pay reparations besides printing money.

And while people made nauseating amounts of money off the world wars, it's more than a bit of a stretch to call them "capitalist wars"
                    Well Germany didn't lose its economy due to a single reason at that time, the Rhineland was occupied and the reparations were fair but harsh, i agree, but the great depression, which jumpstarted the hyperinflation of Germany, as well as strong state ownership was capitalistic in nature,.
It IS a stretch, because whether Communism or capitalism, the deaths of millions on either side was due to humans, the ability to do evil isn't tied to economical models. This is why i tried to grossly point that out with that argument, I dislike seeing red-scare type of comments used as meme, kills potential discussion.
                Germany didn’t go to Nazism because of a capitalist crash. The treaty of Versailles put the blame of the war on them even though all of Europe was ready to throw punches at the start of the war. Hell, people were asking to forgive Germany’s supposed dent to Europe because they knew it would eventually lead to another war and guess what happened? Why do you think the US helped offset parts of the cost of the war and rebuilding following the war? 
Because it doesn't compare. People dying "due to communism" is a bullshit statistic in and off itself, but it's especially shitty when compared to people dying in war, i.e killing each other. 
because this statistic is made up from the debunked black book of communism
They weren't REAL Communists!!!


/s
    That's cause real communism isn't possible. No country has ever followed Marx's process to communism, it's just not going to happen. 

        >  Marx's process to communism

lol you say that like it's some step by step recipe by the chef Karlito Marks
        And it's not going to, unless humans change fundamentally. Marxs idea of communism is almost too utopian for me. 
            Why? It’s basically the fundamentalism of lesser human mind. “I need more free stuff, others should give it to me”
                That's exactly the mindset of a capitalist in Marx's works, well done understanding it.
                    So basically it’s a literature work of projection, zero responsibility and all control of wealth through the nanny state. It has 0 to do with capitalism and free market in real world though.
        The kibbutz system in Israel was pretty close.

I agree though. The economy is to complicated to plan, it's best to let it just happen organically
            economies need intervention, no such thing as an entirely "organic" economy
Very easy, it doesn't matter to the current story. Gotten pretty annoying on reddit that some people somehow think it's necessary to daily fearmonger about communism as if the proletariat is planning to revolt next tuesday and implement some archaic economic-political system that failed more times than you got finger on your hands. 

Not to mention the whole number is misleading, obviously communism isn't a person cutting millions of peoples throats, nor did eg the soviets ever commit genocide, nor did that many people actually starve, but that's another story that really doesn't belong here.

Or the basic idea that it's fucking retarded to use the remembrance of a tragedy far in the past, on reddit of all places, as some political gunpowder against imaginary opponents. 
Because no one asked. Think.
You really don't? Have you seen how many openly communist users reddit has? It's sickening.

Edit: the downvotes prove my point.
    Don't worry, they will keep growing.

    Tell that to Venezuela, lol.
        Mostly a poor attempt at socialism due to corruption, not communism.
            Isnt that always the excuse though? Communism doesnt work because your relying on humans who hold power to be fair. 
                It is a universal excuse for every system. There's no perfect socialism capitalism or communism.  Not one system is better, and none is ever perfectly implemented due to humans. Simply blaming Venezuela's situation to socialism is not looking at the big picture is all I wanted to tell him.
                    No there isnt a perfect system, but id rather have one where im allowed property and the right to criticize whom id like.
Because that obviously wasn't real Communism...duh

        Then you can compare the deaths of these individual wars to other wars, e.g WW2, and it would be an appropriate comparison. Counting vague nonsense numbers as "deaths by communism" and putting them against deaths in certain wars is fucking stupid. 
        And capitalism has caused victims of war all over the Middle East and Central America, but again, this isn’t the time or place. To be clear, communism is a terrible and harmful system, but that doesn’t mean I’m always looking for an opportunity to shit on it. Know your place.
Russian bots that don't want you to talk about glorious Soviet Union
Guess it [depends on the source.](https://www.nationalww2museum.org/students-teachers/student-resources/research-starters/research-starters-worldwide-deaths-world-war) [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties) says 70m to 85m. Jesus.....
    **World War II casualties**

World War II was the deadliest military conflict in history in absolute terms of total casualties. Over 60 million people were killed, which was about 3% of the 1940 world population (est. 2.3 billion). Statistics of military wounded are available for the major combatants.

Until a few years ago AIDS was killing two million africans every year. I think we got plenty reminder as to how dangerous disease can get.
    Thats a preventable condition that is not spread due to contact but ignorance and risky behaivor... big difference
        Yup.  
Somehow I'm sure the spanish got another name for it :\^)
    Royal Flu. We are very proud of it.
        Very progressive.
    Probably 'Catalan Flu'.
It is incredibly lucrative for certain people...lots of things are "wasted resources" that make certain people lots of money.
The military industrial complex though
It depends. WWI and II massively damaged the economies of Britain, France, Germany, Russia etc., whereas America made billions out of them.
It's more like running up to a fallen soldier that you could easily save, but then he shoots himself 🕺
    I wonder if that actually happened in the WW's.
Most of my score is just because of this cycle (revive, supres fire, drop med crate, repeat) there have been times I've had mvp in a match with a 9-25 K/D
    Same I'm normally in the top 3 on my team every match just doing this.
        I would love a squad of just medics. 5 medics running like a wave of unstoppable death... Untill we run out of ammo at least.
            And that’s when the support squad comes in! A maelstrom of bullets!
Not having medics is probably the leading cause of losses in operations, aside from having too many scouts. A well balanced team could probably win a vast majority of operations, regardless of overall skill. 
    My dream is to have a full team of medics who all heal
        But who's gonna deal with the tanks that roll up? Then you'd need medics with rifle grenades. 
            One good assault.
                And a Support with Ammo pouches to quickly resupply the Assault.
 
And one scout with spotting flares, the support should also resupply this scout so that he keeps the enemies lighted up.  
  
Now that's a dream team.
                    Yeah. There should be one of everything with ptfo loadouts and the rest medics. I don't understand why people don't abuse the hell out of the medic class. You've got Jesus' best superpowers ffs
We'll fight proxy wars within another country. 
Cold wars in cyberspace.
And I was just checking back, but holy shit, while the napoleonic wars caused ~6 million deaths, the thirty years war caused ~8 millions deaths almost 200 years earlier.

The latter one being with a much lower population density and mostly limited to the holy roman empire's grounds. That's fucking terrifying. Oo
    Record keeping from these days is ALWAYS suspect dude.
        Of course it is, and historians know that too. And there is a consensus that parts of germany were depopulated by those conflicts, so those numbers might not be so unrealistic.
            Not all historians are truth seeking people.
                That's why you check on the consensus.
                    That's why a consensus means nothing apart from its majority design. Majority's are often wrong or ineffective and detailing the truth about poorly kept data.
    while i can't rember the exact numbers i know the thirty years war killed a higher percentage of the worlds population. with only melee weapons and very early guns too. 
To be fair, that's why this game was called "Battlefield One" in the first place
there were about 200,000,000 deaths in 20th century from war and famine. there were about 3 billion people at the time in 1950 alone, so that is an upwards of 8% of the world population killed. 

    However by the end of the 20th century the population was 6 billion, so the % drops dramatically if you consider the whole century's deaths vs the population. However measuring deaths over such a time period can be inaccurate.

But, even going on your numbers. The Taiping Rebellion for instance has a death toll estimated to be up to 100,000,000 (though the real number is likely much lower) which represented at the very least 10% of the world's 1 billion population. All that from a single conflict. The Spanish/Portuguese Conquest of South America in the 16th century was even deadlier and likely the single most destructive event in human history. 
        [here’s something i found out of curiosity, the death % for population was greatest in 20th century](https://imgur.com/gallery/kfzdj) 
            I'm sorry but whatever source that came from is pure bullshit, and looks kind of euro-centric. More people died in China in the 19th century than that list claims died in the whole world. The death toll in the Americas in the 16th century was likely over 100 million at the least and it claims only 1-2 million died. Even the death toll in just Europe during the 17th century exceeds what this list claims.
                And many records from hundreds of years ago are bullshit too man. You have no actual way of verifying any of it.
That's basically what it sounds like. Like suicide by cop, but with machine guns. It was Americans that told the story too, and even they said the Germans were trying to wave him off. As with most tragedies in war though, we will never know the full story.
It was banned pre-ww1, including things such as Tear Gas, but none of the major European powers gave a shit. France were the first nation to use any form of gas warfare in WW1, prompting the Germans into developing something worse than Tear Gas.

Thus, modern biological warfare was born. 
F
F
Fight fight fight!
such a senseless war 
Every government including France will resort to propaganda to make themselves look better. Sure, I am not saying they were as bad as Russia lol. I just don't get remembrance days based on numbers alone. It comes off as cheesy to me. 

Definitely with WW2 in that those numbers are purely ridiculous on some levels. For Jews, Germans, and Russians. I don't believe any of the final numbers. Russia's are off the charts bullshit.

Still incredibly high mind you, more than anything else. It's just a pity everyone feels the need to lie about it.
Your right the guy I was thinking of passed in 2012 
That’s fantastic! I’ve never heard of a single employer here in the UK doing that, and I have worked or have friends in a whole ton of professions
    I thought it was, my wife is from the UK and she said November 11 is for Remembrance Day so I assumed it would be a bank holiday like Canada
        No bank holiday, I  still work but we have silence at 11:00 for 5 minutes 
            That's lame, canada gives us a full day off paid
                We observed 100% silence for two minutes and I work in a call centre with 1000 other people. I was proud of my guys.
So, I'm not too familiar with the details, but the PPSH was a Soviet gun, and you're saying there shouldn't be any SS uniforms, right?  Basically, you're criticizing the historical accuracy.
    Correct, and they shied away from displaying the swastika and used the iron cross instead.
        Lack of swastikas was in multiplayer only, I believe, which is understandable.  The campaign has them, as far as I know.
Oh, good point.
Oh i see. Thats messed up
    Oh it's worse than that. Not only were people getting publicly shamed into enlisting, even soldiers on leave and discharged veterans were getting harassed.
        Male privilege tho, amirite
        Damn that sucks. Was it like that in america?
The majority of Veterans I know joined for economic reasons: GI bill, training, lack of opportunities in a small rural town.

The rest joined because of family tradition, except that one fucktard that just wanted to kill people.
    I know one in high school who joined just to kill. 
        I know a few from my high school who said the same. I guess they think its gonna all play out like a game of call of duty or something. 
            Ya it’s just fucking crazy man. 
            If you get a chance to talk to someone that's combat arms in the Army, it's a fairly common mindset. We know it's not like CoD, but our job is to take ground and kill the enemy, and we embrace it.
                Thats one thing. Its another thing to be a kid in high school who hasnt even had a taste of this combat and say they already love it. What about when they’re on the receiving end of the ass kicking?
                    Oh yeah, there's a huge difference. Those kids that talk big usually go for a desk job and act all badass. Or cooks lol
    I saw a reddit post earlier for a certain US military branch, where well over half the enlisted personnel did it for economic reasons. Its fucked, you shouldn't have to hold a rifle and go to a foreign land to fight a war to get university education and health care. 
It's rare that I've spoken to an older generation that isn't influenced by social media either. That doesn't mean that entire generation is bad.
    Of course not. Not saying the whole generation is "bad". 
> It's not a celebration of war in the slightest.

I attended my town's Remembrance Day ceremony today. The speaker asked us to remember and celebrate all past, present, and future military members and all they have done. I support the holiday, and will continue to do so. Sayings it's not a celebration is wrong though. 

We remember those that fell (or will in the future) while also celebrating the country's goals and achievements won.
He's not talking about Remembrance Day ceremonies though. You've misread his entire comment and become offended over nothing.  
    I'm not offended. And yes he is talking about Remembrance Day.

 I think it's you that seems to be a bit confused here. 

"Living in the UK it just feels very hard to think that Remembrance Day hasn't turned into a patriotic pro-war day of drivel."

Why I mentioned the ceremonies which show you what it's actually about, far more than social media / pop culture will. 

        He clearly wasn't talking about ceremonies.

Turn on the news and you get a better picture.
        Yes but the ceremonies are not the only part of the day, he's very clearly talking about the more modern aspects of Remembrance Day. Not just the ceremonies. 

Remembrance Day ceremonies have always been very tasteful and somber events that highlight the horrors of war. What op is talking about though is the corporate and political highjacking of days like today. Very clear difference. 
        War is stupid and most of them volunteered to go there. So whatever happened after that, it's on them. This is not a video game, you sign up for the possibility of DYING in DAY ONE. There's no jobs about? Well fucking move somewhere else then.
            Some people are born warriors and soldiers. Doesn't mean it's not on them, but doesn't mean their deaths don't mean anything. No need to disrespect just because you don't agree.
                in the grand scheme of things, let's just say that the Vietnam war deaths don't mean absolutely anything.

that has nothing to do with what I said though
[deleted]
    Have you considered it's not trolling, per se? Obviously, I'm trolling you right here and now, but at the same time, all the lurkers that wouldn't have said anything did, in fact, pay respects. Not to mention, the top comment is about how absurd and terrible the death toll really is. 

So yeah. You can say the thread is shit, and that's your opinion, but it isn't. It still serves the same purpose, which is to remind us of what was supposed to be the war to end all wars, but only marks the beginning of an exceptionally bloody period in history, and a race for power fueled by military expansion: the end, and beginning, of an era. 

So, tl:dr, just because people don't pour their hearts out doesn't mean they don't get it. 
You need to do some reading then. 
Because it's always a slaughter for the attacking side.   It's futile going after B.

It makes me think that's a real taste of WW1.   Doomed attacks that do nothing, a slaughter and wasted lives for nothing taken.    When you view it like that and that you won't win it's a fun experience.
I mean yeah
    Just paid 10 bucks for episodes 34 to 39 on Rome. Dis gon b gud
The graphic presentation, especially that transfer from German Western Front casualties to the Eastern Front, and then specifically for Stalingrad, gave me goosebumps. 
    The way the soviets kept... on... ticking... it was horrifying. It opened my eyes to the fact that the Germans saw their fight against the soviets as the main fight. It was a fight for survival for both sides. The bloodiest a war can be.
        I've seen the statistics before but it's hard to really comprehend the scale. Seeing it displayed like this is helpful, and horrifying.
        There’s always that gut wrenching disgust at the lives lost on Normandy D-day invasion for me because of how well that scene as been adapted to media like Saving Pvt Ryan and Medal of Honor. 

But all those deaths are peanuts compared to Stalingrad. That’s not even innocent civilians either. :-/
        It just keeps going up...and up....and up.
        It was a war of extermination. 
    Makes me wonder what would have happened if they stayed allied .
And to be fair. School history never did a good job of talking about the eastern front. I only recall learning about Stalingrad maybe twice throughout junior high and high school. This video is great at creating a picture for how devastation it was for the Soviets. 
    Post-cold war propaganda and relationships has our society pretty adverse to recognizing the Soviets efforts in the war and how they far surpassed our own. 

We're pretty afraid to display that without them...there was absolutely no chance of saving western europe. 
        My school barely even spoke about the world wars. History education in England is embarrassing. I can honestly say anything I know about history is because I went out and learnt it myself. Worrying to think about the amount of people that are completely unaware of the scale of the world wars.
Even then it doesn't make sense. The world population only increased about 30% during that time period. Meanwhile soldier deaths in WW1 were about 8~ million, and soldier deaths in WW2 were anywhere from 17-25 million. 
    It was 18 million,  not 8
        15-18 million is the upper total, including civilians. About 8 million soldiers died, and anywhere from 5-10 million civilians died, mostly in Russia and the Ottoman Empire. 
Only 2 tyrants?
Dummkopf
Someone should really stop that guy.
my dad killed more people than your dad!!
Many people try to use it to deflect guilt, or to prove that an enemy is worse than you think. 
    whataboutism
        Whataboutism is used as deflection when criticizing someone. 

“Russia has committed numerous civil rights atrocities”

“What about America? You are lynching negroes” 

Is the classic example. 

Sort of sort. For instance when the great famine hit China, it was caused by failing infrastructure by 25 years of war and natural disasters. Mao implemented policies to relive the famine (killing birds etc) but ended up causing more problems. It’s debatable whether this would have happened with communism or not, and the 1959-1963 famine which killed 40 million wasn’t too different from pre communist famines. 

The ussr was a bit different. They weaponized famine against populations they didn’t like, mostly Ukrainians. When famine and drought hit in 1933, they specifically did not send help to relieve the famine in Ukraine and took their food to punish the Ukrainians. But the overall famine of the era was caused by natural disasters for the most part, it was pretty normal for famine to erupt every decade or two in the region. 
Then go play my son, play to hearts content or until you get in trouble. Whichever comes first
I️ think you’re probably ignorant of the conditions that Britain imposed on its colonies, forcing India to produce cash crops in times of famine that killed ended up killing millions of people, to give a single example.
    I thought you were talking about Capitalism, but now you're referencing the terrors of Imperialism... I can't say I follow.

        WW1 and 2 could both be argued to be capitalistic wars. Germany slid down the path of Nazism due to the economic hardship resulting from a capitalist economy crash. Also cant forget all of the manufacturers and rich war barons, whom profited from both wars and millions of deaths. Also see multiple other wars and injustices done in capitalist countries and you'll realise the system isn't the problem, it's always who leads at the end.
            Lolwut. Germany didn't fall into economic depression because capitalism, they did so because the Treaty of Versailles fucked them sideways economically and they had no way to pay reparations besides printing money.

And while people made nauseating amounts of money off the world wars, it's more than a bit of a stretch to call them "capitalist wars"
                Well Germany didn't lose its economy due to a single reason at that time, the Rhineland was occupied and the reparations were fair but harsh, i agree, but the great depression, which jumpstarted the hyperinflation of Germany, as well as strong state ownership was capitalistic in nature,.
It IS a stretch, because whether Communism or capitalism, the deaths of millions on either side was due to humans, the ability to do evil isn't tied to economical models. This is why i tried to grossly point that out with that argument, I dislike seeing red-scare type of comments used as meme, kills potential discussion.
            Germany didn’t go to Nazism because of a capitalist crash. The treaty of Versailles put the blame of the war on them even though all of Europe was ready to throw punches at the start of the war. Hell, people were asking to forgive Germany’s supposed dent to Europe because they knew it would eventually lead to another war and guess what happened? Why do you think the US helped offset parts of the cost of the war and rebuilding following the war? 
That's cause real communism isn't possible. No country has ever followed Marx's process to communism, it's just not going to happen. 

    >  Marx's process to communism

lol you say that like it's some step by step recipe by the chef Karlito Marks
    And it's not going to, unless humans change fundamentally. Marxs idea of communism is almost too utopian for me. 
        Why? It’s basically the fundamentalism of lesser human mind. “I need more free stuff, others should give it to me”
            That's exactly the mindset of a capitalist in Marx's works, well done understanding it.
                So basically it’s a literature work of projection, zero responsibility and all control of wealth through the nanny state. It has 0 to do with capitalism and free market in real world though.
    The kibbutz system in Israel was pretty close.

I agree though. The economy is to complicated to plan, it's best to let it just happen organically
        economies need intervention, no such thing as an entirely "organic" economy
Don't worry, they will keep growing.

The death toll in the Americas in the 16th century was likely over 100 million at the least and it claims only 1-2 million died. Even the death toll in just Europe during the 17th century exceeds what this list claims.
            And many records from hundreds of years ago are bullshit too man. You have no actual way of verifying any of it.
I thought it was, my wife is from the UK and she said November 11 is for Remembrance Day so I assumed it would be a bank holiday like Canada
    No bank holiday, I  still work but we have silence at 11:00 for 5 minutes 
        That's lame, canada gives us a full day off paid
            We observed 100% silence for two minutes and I work in a call centre with 1000 other people. I was proud of my guys.
Correct, and they shied away from displaying the swastika and used the iron cross instead.
    Lack of swastikas was in multiplayer only, I believe, which is understandable.  The campaign has them, as far as I know.
Oh it's worse than that. Not only were people getting publicly shamed into enlisting, even soldiers on leave and discharged veterans were getting harassed.
    Male privilege tho, amirite
    Damn that sucks. Was it like that in america?
I know one in high school who joined just to kill. 
    I know a few from my high school who said the same. I guess they think its gonna all play out like a game of call of duty or something. 
        Ya it’s just fucking crazy man. 
        If you get a chance to talk to someone that's combat arms in the Army, it's a fairly common mindset. We know it's not like CoD, but our job is to take ground and kill the enemy, and we embrace it.
            Thats one thing. Its another thing to be a kid in high school who hasnt even had a taste of this combat and say they already love it. What about when they’re on the receiving end of the ass kicking?
                Oh yeah, there's a huge difference. Those kids that talk big usually go for a desk job and act all badass. Or cooks lol
I saw a reddit post earlier for a certain US military branch, where well over half the enlisted personnel did it for economic reasons. Its fucked, you shouldn't have to hold a rifle and go to a foreign land to fight a war to get university education and health care. 
Of course not. Not saying the whole generation is "bad". 
I'm not offended. And yes he is talking about Remembrance Day.

 I think it's you that seems to be a bit confused here. 

"Living in the UK it just feels very hard to think that Remembrance Day hasn't turned into a patriotic pro-war day of drivel."

Why I mentioned the ceremonies which show you what it's actually about, far more than social media / pop culture will. 

    He clearly wasn't talking about ceremonies.

Turn on the news and you get a better picture.
    Yes but the ceremonies are not the only part of the day, he's very clearly talking about the more modern aspects of Remembrance Day. Not just the ceremonies. 

Remembrance Day ceremonies have always been very tasteful and somber events that highlight the horrors of war. What op is talking about though is the corporate and political highjacking of days like today. Very clear difference. 
    War is stupid and most of them volunteered to go there. So whatever happened after that, it's on them. This is not a video game, you sign up for the possibility of DYING in DAY ONE. There's no jobs about? Well fucking move somewhere else then.
        Some people are born warriors and soldiers. Doesn't mean it's not on them, but doesn't mean their deaths don't mean anything. No need to disrespect just because you don't agree.
            in the grand scheme of things, let's just say that the Vietnam war deaths don't mean absolutely anything. 
Have you considered it's not trolling, per se? Obviously, I'm trolling you right here and now, but at the same time, all the lurkers that wouldn't have said anything did, in fact, pay respects. Not to mention, the top comment is about how absurd and terrible the death toll really is. 

So yeah. You can say the thread is shit, and that's your opinion, but it isn't. It still serves the same purpose, which is to remind us of what was supposed to be the war to end all wars, but only marks the beginning of an exceptionally bloody period in history, and a race for power fueled by military expansion: the end, and beginning, of an era. 

So, tl:dr, just because people don't pour their hearts out doesn't mean they don't get it. 
Just paid 10 bucks for episodes 34 to 39 on Rome. Dis gon b gud
The way the soviets kept... on... ticking... it was horrifying. It opened my eyes to the fact that the Germans saw their fight against the soviets as the main fight. It was a fight for survival for both sides. The bloodiest a war can be.
    I've seen the statistics before but it's hard to really comprehend the scale. Seeing it displayed like this is helpful, and horrifying.
    There’s always that gut wrenching disgust at the lives lost on Normandy D-day invasion for me because of how well that scene as been adapted to media like Saving Pvt Ryan and Medal of Honor. 

But all those deaths are peanuts compared to Stalingrad. That’s not even innocent civilians either. :-/
    It just keeps going up...and up....and up.
    It was a war of extermination. 
Makes me wonder what would have happened if they stayed allied .
Post-cold war propaganda and relationships has our society pretty adverse to recognizing the Soviets efforts in the war and how they far surpassed our own. 

We're pretty afraid to display that without them...there was absolutely no chance of saving western europe. 
    My school barely even spoke about the world wars. History education in England is embarrassing. I can honestly say anything I know about history is because I went out and learnt it myself. Worrying to think about the amount of people that are completely unaware of the scale of the world wars.
It was 18 million,  not 8
    15-18 million is the upper total, including civilians. About 8 million soldiers died, and anywhere from 5-10 million civilians died, mostly in Russia and the Ottoman Empire. 
whataboutism
    Whataboutism is used as deflection when criticizing someone. 

“Russia has committed numerous civil rights atrocities”

“What about America? You are lynching negroes” 

Is the classic example. 

I thought you were talking about Capitalism, but now you're referencing the terrors of Imperialism... I can't say I follow.

    WW1 and 2 could both be argued to be capitalistic wars. Germany slid down the path of Nazism due to the economic hardship resulting from a capitalist economy crash. Also cant forget all of the manufacturers and rich war barons, whom profited from both wars and millions of deaths. Also see multiple other wars and injustices done in capitalist countries and you'll realise the system isn't the problem, it's always who leads at the end.
        Lolwut. Germany didn't fall into economic depression because capitalism, they did so because the Treaty of Versailles fucked them sideways economically and they had no way to pay reparations besides printing money.

And while people made nauseating amounts of money off the world wars, it's more than a bit of a stretch to call them "capitalist wars"
            Well Germany didn't lose its economy due to a single reason at that time, the Rhineland was occupied and the reparations were fair but harsh, i agree, but the great depression, which jumpstarted the hyperinflation of Germany, as well as strong state ownership was capitalistic in nature,.
It IS a stretch, because whether Communism or capitalism, the deaths of millions on either side was due to humans, the ability to do evil isn't tied to economical models. This is why i tried to grossly point that out with that argument, I dislike seeing red-scare type of comments used as meme, kills potential discussion.
        Germany didn’t go to Nazism because of a capitalist crash. The treaty of Versailles put the blame of the war on them even though all of Europe was ready to throw punches at the start of the war. Hell, people were asking to forgive Germany’s supposed dent to Europe because they knew it would eventually lead to another war and guess what happened? Why do you think the US helped offset parts of the cost of the war and rebuilding following the war? 
>  Marx's process to communism

lol you say that like it's some step by step recipe by the chef Karlito Marks
And it's not going to, unless humans change fundamentally. Marxs idea of communism is almost too utopian for me. 
    Why? It’s basically the fundamentalism of lesser human mind. “I need more free stuff, others should give it to me”
        That's exactly the mindset of a capitalist in Marx's works, well done understanding it.
            So basically it’s a literature work of projection, zero responsibility and all control of wealth through the nanny state. It has 0 to do with capitalism and free market in real world though.
The kibbutz system in Israel was pretty close.

I agree though. The economy is to complicated to plan, it's best to let it just happen organically
    economies need intervention, no such thing as an entirely "organic" economy
Mostly a poor attempt at socialism due to corruption, not communism.
    Isnt that always the excuse though? Communism doesnt work because your relying on humans who hold power to be fair. 
        It is a universal excuse for every system. There's no perfect socialism capitalism or communism.  Not one system is better, and none is ever perfectly implemented due to humans. Simply blaming Venezuela's situation to socialism is not looking at the big picture is all I wanted to tell him.
            No there isnt a perfect system, but id rather have one where im allowed property and the right to criticize whom id like.
No he's saying that Russian bot are the ones downvoting
    [deleted]
Then you can compare the deaths of these individual wars to other wars, e.g WW2, and it would be an appropriate comparison. Counting vague nonsense numbers as "deaths by communism" and putting them against deaths in certain wars is fucking stupid. 
And capitalism has caused victims of war all over the Middle East and Central America, but again, this isn’t the time or place. To be clear, communism is a terrible and harmful system, but that doesn’t mean I’m always looking for an opportunity to shit on it. Know your place.
Yup.  
Very progressive.
I would love a squad of just medics. 5 medics running like a wave of unstoppable death... Untill we run out of ammo at least.
    And that’s when the support squad comes in! A maelstrom of bullets!
But who's gonna deal with the tanks that roll up? Then you'd need medics with rifle grenades. 
    One good assault.
        And a Support with Ammo pouches to quickly resupply the Assault.
 
And one scout with spotting flares, the support should also resupply this scout so that he keeps the enemies lighted up.  
  
Now that's a dream team.
            Yeah. There should be one of everything with ptfo loadouts and the rest medics. I don't understand why people don't abuse the hell out of the medic class. You've got Jesus' best superpowers ffs
Of course it is, and historians know that too. And there is a consensus that parts of germany were depopulated by those conflicts, so those numbers might not be so unrealistic.
    Not all historians are truth seeking people.
        That's why you check on the consensus.
            That's why a consensus means nothing apart from its majority design. Majority's are often wrong or ineffective and detailing the truth about poorly kept data.
