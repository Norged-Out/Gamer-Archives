[[The Demon of Empire City]]





Cole!🖤
    Cole seriously needs more love imo. 😊 I had a lot of fun making this picture and I am excited to make more!
Love this
    Thanks! 😁
The demon must T pose to asset dominance over the normal and _puny_ humans.
    Pffft, I didn't notice that! 😆
Technically New Marais. He never wears that outfit in Empire City. Awesome picture though.
    You know that “The Demon of Empire City” is the name Bertrand gives him in *inFAMOUS 2*, right? It has nothing to do with where he is at the moment lmao.
        Oh yeah. Sorry, forgot about that.
    I'm aware. 😁 Thanks! I'm glad that you like the picture and I plan on posting more!
        I'll make sure to find the others when you post them!
            The InFAMOUS series seriously deserves more love imo, so I'm happy to contribute to the community when my procrastination isn't making my brain a swarm of bees! 😆
