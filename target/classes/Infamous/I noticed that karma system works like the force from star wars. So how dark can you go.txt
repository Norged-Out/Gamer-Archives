[[I noticed that karma system works like the force from star wars. So how dark can you go]]


If you stray too far to the dark side it physically changes you and makes your powers dark as a result like a sith lord.

Stay good amd your powers grow stronger without going crazy like a jedi.

So this makes me wonder. How dark do you have to be before your powers start to corrupt you? Both kessler and augustine were "evil" but we saw that they didn't physically change any if at all.

Also makes me wonder if evil karma cole in infamous 2 was basically right inbetween the light and dark because he wasnt EVIL evil.

Makes you wonder if kesslers white lightning means that technically he was doing his good karma route by making present cole into a hero


Both Augustine and Kessler are more morally grey characters. They do some bad things in service of what they believe to be the “greater good”. I believe that’s why neither are seriously warped like Evil Cole or Sasha, who are genuinely evil.
    Ah so basically if they went the neutral route
Murder your whole family out of spite in Second Son. That's pretty sithy.
    What family? Delsin had nome outside Reggie.

Cole does even worse he slaughters humans so Conduits can live on the evil ending.
        He murdered Betty and at the very least a large portion of his tribe which is the closest thing to family he has. Otherwise he wouldn’t have went to Seattle in the first place if they weren’t
            This.
It reminds me a lot of the fable games too, where the more evil you become, the more demonic and gross you become in appearance to reflect your choices
Please make sure to use the spoiler tag in the future! It has been added for you this time.
Neither Cole nor Delsin pretend their actions are heroic, they fully embrace their darkness, both Kessler and Augustine fooled themselves into thinking they were good people, there's no magical force in Infamous that forces these changes, it's their own power evolving based on their own mindset.
I always thought it was never the powers corrupting Cole and Del. Evil karma is just them choosing to be evil  and the powers changing to match their personalty. Bascally like someone else in this thread said. ‘It’s their own power evolving based on their mindset’
Yeah but more so that's just game mechanics. Nothings stopping Cole or Delsin from not doing technical to more chaotic attacks outside mechanics and they're the only Conduits to turn to look healthy or evil. Clearly a gene design aesthetic.
