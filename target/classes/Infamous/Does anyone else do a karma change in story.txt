[[Does anyone else do a karma change in story]]


Like IF1 good then import that save and become evil in IF2 or vise versa? i think it’s a pretty neat idea kinda like he becomes more evil/more good because of the previous game’s experience


This is how i experienced it. I did the first game with evil karma and then did the second with good karma. Genuinely felt like a good story especially with how cole acted and sounds in the first game
My first playthrough I let Cole be evil and then I redeemed him halfway through. But these games punish you for playing that way. I think letting hero turn evil, or a villain redeem themselves without being punished would be interesting for the karma system
On one play through I was good up until Trish dies. Then things... shifted. Sat on all my upgrade points until then.
Yes
