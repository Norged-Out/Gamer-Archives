[[Official Civ 6 Chat!!]]





I just started playing the game today and I am super confused. I could use some advice.
What time is the new dlc releasing?
Rome is pretty straight forward
Anyone still play civ 6 ? Would love to do a multiplayer game
Just started playing Civ5, what is a good community to join for Civ5 (and 4X) n00bs?
r/4xgaming might be good
I‚Äôd say watch quill18‚Äôs videos on YouTube, it‚Äôs what I used to get into the game a few years ago.

YouTube.com/watch?v=pczrASkYGSo
Any recommendations for a beginner? About halfway through my first campaign
Just got into the game any advice
Why do we have to pay for the new DLC when it was clearly stated that it was free if we already own everything else?
Hey, just got the game, can I set the next turn to auto click in a multiplayer game?
Yoo

What‚Äôs y‚Äôall build order ?
    On land: scout, scout, settler 75% of games.

On coast: scout, builder (for fishing), settler 75%

I used to go scout, slinger, settler, but I value golden ages now more then I did then.
Does anybody play mobile?
scout, scout, settler, buy military...... with heroes added you gotta go scout monument
The build order changes for me but basically scout > warrior -> settler -> builder. But if I go Gilgamesh, or Hammurabi, I‚Äôm going: UU -> UU -> settlor -> UU -> builder. Then looking to take out the nearest civ or city state
    what's UU?
i play some times u/Stax0472
My civ 6 on dx12 keep on crashing wonder what might be the reason?

I just won my first civ game with three cities and under 100 turns
Does anyone know about any try hard CIV VI reddit pages?
How do I spice up gameplay without any dlc?
I have civilization 6 on my switch and on my computer but its not installed on my pc which would you guys prefer? I could download it on my computer or is there not a large of a difference between computer and nintendo switch?
Computer easily. Loads so much faster
introduced my buddy to civ 6 on playstation I have the 4 he has the 5. As we load in I tell him the best part is right now. The ps5 loaded so fast it only flashed our man Sean Beans screen and loaded him into the game
Unique Unit
For example: Scythia gets the Saka Horse Archer as their unique unit. No one else gets that unit

I just started playing this game since I forgot I got it for free and decided to actually install it and I ended up playing til 4am

    I don‚Äôt have the problem on an original pro
Just tried to play a game with the new barbarian mod with a friend. Whenever we finished the turn, everyone but the host would be kicked and would have to re-join. Plus, you can see the xp bar from barb camps in unexplored land, as well as some units? I saw an archer "pin" in unexplored land, went there, and saw nothing. We played with Gathering Storm and Rise and Fall, nothing else.
Every time I go for a domination win I accidentally get a religious win. Domination just takes so long capturing every city. Any advice? It‚Äôs the only victory type I haven‚Äôt gotten yet.
Why can't my frigate attack a city one tile away from the shore?

I have Civ6 for the switch, wondering if anyone can tell me if I‚Äôm missing the slider for adjusting the intensity of barbarians, cause I can‚Äôt seem to find one, and sometimes, in settler setting, the barbarians can be overwhelming in the early game?
I ask to myself : Someone know what's the song used in the last Civ 6 video ?
anyone wants to play?
Hi, I have a question, do you think there will be another frontier pass? Or the game is complete now?

Does anyone have advice for desyncing games? My friend and I used to play games no problem. Now they are always desyncing.
has anyone been able to access Portugal yet? I can't find anything anywhere saying when the update is going to go live, but I know it's today.
I‚Äôm waiting for Portugal too
At what hour usually they release the updates ? I‚Äôm in Italy
Is this game worth it for Nintendo switch?
I certainly think so
Portugal is dope
I‚Äôm mid game rn and liking it a lot
Just started playing king lvl I can‚Äôt even get off the beach lol
Even barbarian kill me
Playing on Series X and although I can see all the achievements for Joa√µ, still can access Portugal either.
Can‚Äôt*
Anyway I can get Lisbon back instead of Mogadishu?  I don‚Äôt have the Portugal pack to disable/enable.
PS4 crashes a lot of times when you pass turn 300 more or less. It crashed 3 times in 2 hours of playing yesterday
Playing on Garuda Linux, bought on steam, tuxbelial stems tag ;)
Is there a way to trick an ally into declaring war on another CIV?
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet

hello guys, I have a really strange problem, in epic games when I press launch opens the my2k launcher, not the normal one where u chose the Dx, and in that new launcher there is a button to launch the game but instead it's sais "install Epic games" but as I just said I already have Epic games installed, idk what to do.
i have the Same problem
I have same problems only difference is I'm install them from Steam...helpüòî
Still doesnt work for others ?
2k is teying to fix it
Came here to b*tch about the new launcher... why does 2k do this to us?
I was really looking forward to getting a couple hours in with Portugal but my game won't even start because of the new launcher. Has anyone been able to fix this problem yet? I've done the whole uninstall and reinstall thing to no avail.
the launcher sucks
I can't open this game
anyone want to play on PS4?
Is civ 6 done completely after this update?
Is anybody having trouble connecting to friends on ps4
Like it keeps saying Retrieving Host Data
i was lucky that i found the old launcher in yhe game files. i have no trouble starting up
the new launcher is saying I need to buy the game. I have almost 1200 hours on it in steam. What do I do?
Is anyone trying to play on Xbox? Figure I‚Äôd give this a shot.
2K launcher sucks, also I have a question about the Industry option: Why did they make it require a Great Merchant to make a product? These products are way too weak to justify losing the Merchant's skills, and there's definitely no hope of there being enough Great Merchants in the game to fill the slots in a typical Civ.
Are the patch notes out?
nahh not yet still waiting
Update still not out!! What the poop
I thought I had a new download but turns out I haven‚Äôt played in a while and this feed confirms that the new update has yet to be active
Is anyone having problems with the bot turns on ps4? My friends and i keep de-syncing almost every turn past 25.  
We just wanna play civüò©
I can‚Äôt seem to play as either India, Japan, or Korea any more. So you know why?
Barb camps can‚Äôt be camped on anymore, or rather will auto disband after a number of turns with an occupying unit. And horses were already revealed at the beginning of my Gaul run, were not part of animal husbandry unlocks.
For me we cant even join together on ps4
I mean we bought this game just to play together and cant even join the private game its annoying af and i think well boycott the game till 2k gets up on their lazy behind and fixes it
No offence but i just hate the hype to be dissapointet so much im sorry if i offended any players or developers with my comments but i just wanna play civ 6 to be honest
Have a good day my friends

I‚Äôve tried Secret Societies once or twice, but the bonuses felt TOO extreme. I mean, immortal vampires with 100 strength going up against crossbows and muskets? That‚Äôs too much.

can anybody tell me how i can set the game settings so that i can play in full screen mode? It always starts windowed
 

Hello,

I am looking for some people to play some civ 6 PS4 games with me. I am looking for some casual players that can commit to log on only a couple hours a week. I am experienced in civ but not very good, I am looking for people that are a similar skill level to me (I am able to beat the game on king difficulty no problem but struggle on emperor). If there is anyone out there looking to start a game, let me know. Expansions are preferred.

is there a discord for civilization 6 games?
?somebody know what to do when I get this message? "There was an error starting your game. We recommend disabling any mods   
and trying again. Error- One or more of your Mods failed to load   
content."
Disable all mods and see if you get the issue. Then add a mod and start over. It sucks, but there is a mod that is not playing well with your version and the "divide and conquer" method of testing is you only hope. You can limit your exposure but turning on the most recently added mods; which are most likely the cause.
but turning = by turning
Is there a discord?

Hello Guys, got conflicting information after googling - does anyone know if you can share DLCs during online play? Meaning we can play with DLC\`s if one person has them? Thinking if I should buy them, but I only play with fried.
Any cheaper way anyone knows to get Civilization packs than Steam sale? I have all expansions, but only two extra Civs that came with my base game.  I need 12, so even discounted it is 32 dollars!  Buying all of them would make them cost more than I paid for the base game or both expansions.
steam is checking your library so you can't paid twice for same dlc

guys where is the settler from the pantheon. Did they remove it. I was first to get 15 faith but there is no pantheon where I get a settler
For sure it was removed in BBG, dunno if also in vanila, but if it's clearly missing, then it was :D
just wanna drop in and say i'm playing for the first time right now and i love it. it's so fucking addicting. i could play for hours upon hours, something i rarely do. the "just one more turn" curse is real.

so uhm is it worth it to get all expansions?
    get the platinum edition and then the frontier pass :)
Gathering storm is far the better dlc in my opinion, it includes all new game mechanics of Rise and Fall but missing some natural and world wonders, and a few civs.

Does frontier pack crash a lot on next gen Xbox?
What time does the leader's pack drop?
came here to ask the same ^
Yeah, boys wheres the leaders pack, its 21 Nov already!
Okay, it's live now on Steam...but how do we get it for free
so if I buy anthology right now, would I get the leader pass?
My game don't start :(
I sent a message to support asking if there was something we need to do. I opened the launcher to see if that needed to do it, but it still says I don't own the Leader Pass. (Yes, I have all the other DLC)
Trying to load a multiplayer save game just crashes the game for me
Um, tried to boot up the game and it booted up as the base version?
That was weird.
I have too base version.
Trying to reinstall and see if that corrects the issue, maybe.
"Hey! The Leader Pass is live, but it might take some time to process users who own Civ VI Anthology before it's delivered to you at no extra cost."
I reinstalled the game and it corrected the base game issue (I'm on Steam on Windows 10). It now loads properly. Still waiting on Leader Pass content.
Is there any fix to all of your DLC missing?
I restarted my PC and reinstalled the game
It fixed. Still no access to the new leaders though
Check for Julius Caesar, he was available for me. Still waiting on Leader Pass, though.
Has anyone been able to check out of Steam with the Anthology? I keep getting an error when putting in a payment method.
A workaround: If you're having trouble checking out, buy the anthology (complete your collection) WITH a different game.

Does leader pass available for those who bought all game content separately?
Any Mac users having trouble downloading?
Civ 6 installed from  Epic, had Anthology upgrade but now GS expansion is missing, my saves are not loading
any help or work arounds?
Mac + Steam user checking in. Update broke my game so I couldn‚Äôt launch. Had to uninstall and reinstall then it worked perfectly. Make note of what mods you have activated because a reset will happen (everything will be activated when you first relaunch). And the new leaders pack is there for me. Again, Steam user on Mac. 

Leader abilities seem‚Ä¶ weak. Playing first game as Saladin now and seems just ok. A bit underwhelmed.
I figured out how to get the leader pass for free on steam if you already own everything else. You can add anthology bundle for $0.00 to cart and it comes with leader pass. However, it cannot complete a $0 transaction. I added a $0.99 game to cart and it went through. Funny thing is that if you already downloaded Julius. Then you probably already have it downloaded, just locked behind an invisible wall.

Terrible that our infrastructure doesn‚Äôt allow us to receive free gifts from devs :/
I‚Äôm seeing an error when trying to open the game from launch pad

Hey. Question, my brother and I always try to play with our friends but it always give the connection to host has been lost.

Hey. Odd question, but since the community for Civ V doesn‚Äôt seem to exist‚Ä¶. Can anyone here assist me with a bug I‚Äôm having in that game?
Nevermind. I‚Äôve located the r/Civ sub. Gotta love how Reddit search functions work.
Yeah, actually, right after I noped out of here.
For whatever reason it didn‚Äôt occur to me to look up Civ5 not Civilization V.
Granted, I would argue the former should appear when searching the latter.
But I still haven‚Äôt been able to find a solution for my problem

Instability issues on PC. With mods, late game crashes without fail. Without mods would the game be at least reliable on huge maps with maximum civs + city states? Thanks!

Game frequently crashes on PS5 and corrupts its save-files this way. Annoying to lose started games frequently.

In your opinion, who is the best civ charcter to choose and why? (I‚Äôm a new player)
to anyone that knows, is there a reason i can't combine my 3 Artillery Corps into an Army? i've formed armies already and have even straight up made armies. could it be because one of the units is named? (accidentally named it and it goes without saying i have the civic tree upgrade) thanks
it must be something i'm missing, i just moved 3 more Corps together from a different unit type and none of them want to make an Army either. :/

the city has zero health but I can't do anything with it, and if I stop attacking it starts to regenerate
Sorry I‚Äôm a bit late you probably figured it out now but you need to move a unit into the city like if it has 0 health from planes or whatever you still need to get a unit into it to claim it (not sure if it has to be a melee unit or not but it might have to be
