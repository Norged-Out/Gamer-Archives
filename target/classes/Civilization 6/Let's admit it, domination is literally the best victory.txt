[[Let's admit it, domination is literally the best victory]]





Every time I try to NOT be a warmongering little toerag some other Civ will attack me and by the time I've slapped them back to the Stone Age I've piled up so many grievances that everyone denounces me and I have to slap them too.
    Maybe in the next game grievances can take some changes. ‚ÄúWarmongering‚Äù as a status needs to be removed or able to be adjusted using non-combat means. We don‚Äôt see germany or france as modern warmongers because they took land from however many centuries ago, shouldn‚Äôt be that way in civ either
        The world hasn‚Äôt forgotten about Germany and France, we‚Äôre just waiting to invent death robots before we do anything about it.
        This is my biggest gripe about civ 6, personally. I really do not enjoy the grievances system. It stifles too many types of gameplay.
        Speak for yourself, I don‚Äôt see the French or Germans should be trusted.
            Neither should anyone trust the americans
                any big nation you cannot trust, more like, most of all nations
        I love how you skipped over the glorious British empire
            Ooh good point
    Right?!  Or whenever an allied Civ asks for you to go to war with them to take care of a common problem, you take out the enemy Civ and then your ally turns on you for being a warmonger?  I‚Äôm always like ‚Äúhold on, this whole operation was YOUR idea!‚Äù
    Honestly, I‚Äôm the most peace-loving Civ builder until someone attacks me at which point I go scorched Earth, building my armies up, rushing science until I can decimate everyone else and win by domination.
        I'm just like you .. well unless Mansa forward settles me, or Alexander sends a lone settler into my future city area, or xxxx takes out that city state I had 6 envoys in, yyyy sends an apostle or missionary into my territory and won't stop sending them.. ü§î.. ok .. maybe I'm not that peaceful. üòÅ
    Every deity game ever. Flight rush, murder. Win diplomatic but still... kill!
        Nobody can say you're a bad diplomat if there's no one left to say it
    And this attempt I am playing as German. So that nazi joke is legit right now... NEIN!!!
If I see any other civ beating me in culture or science, I immediately go into nuke factory mode üòÇ
    To be extra petty, I nuke them then make them give me all the great works in the peace offering, I‚Äôm far too lazy to capture whole empires. Nuke + a very brave helicopter on capitals lol
I get a little behind on the space race and nukes start flying
There's a reason why I get bombers around 1500.
    Enemy: ‚Äúbehold our wonderful technology!  We have harnessed the power of gunpowder!‚Äù

Me, flying in with nuclear bombers and cruise missiles: ‚Äúyea, thats great and all.  Congrats on your advances.  By the way, have you heard of this cool little thing called Uranium?‚Äù
Gandhi and Peter do have that effect on me as soon as they say hello.
Cultural is my favorite
    Religion or culture for sure.

Culture could be done better. It's messy and stressful a lot.
        In my games, I find that Religion and Culture victories tend to suffer most from that situation where you've already won, but you have to wait another 20 turns for the game to end.
            Culture: "32 turns to victory"

Is just wackadoodle bipolar adventure, but I wanna do victories other than steamroller domination.
        I liked how they did it in revolutions. Win over enough cities or build enough wonders.
    French Eleanor is my jam. Collecting wonders, great works, and fringe civilization cities is awesome.
        Shes my favorite character. I just like building giant cities and collecting wonders, so shes perfect for me
This is totally me as well. I can really understand how the Romans always claimed all their wars were defensive and they ended up with all that territory. I never want to go to war, but once I‚Äôm in I‚Äôm not backing down which inevitably pisses the other civs off which then go to war with me.
    Yeah, that gets me, too! How AI can start a war, but you're the one getting denounced for turning the tables and winning. 

That's why I built up warriors at the star. Once someone says hello, I surround the start city and destroy them so I can have the whole continent to myself. Let the AI have it amongst themselves somewhere else while I focus on growth and improvements.
    Ghengis Khan can relate to this somewhat as well. People loved to piss that guy off (to their immediate perill)
I'll admit no such thing. Personally I find domination to be tedious and often boring.
    That‚Äôs cool but I have a counter point : Haha nukes go brrrrrrrrrrr
This is why I‚Äôm such a fan of Civ 6, it makes the other victory types actually interesting to play.
Funny enough I‚Äôve never won a domination victory. It‚Äôs always diplomatic victory for me (even when I‚Äôm not trying)
    This is why I always play with diplomatic victory disabled
    My first ever victories in civ 5 and 6 were both accidental diplomatic victories
I love culture. Domination is just tedious
    Culture is so fun, I'll do science if I want a longer game.

I'm trying to figure my way through my first religious victory currently.
If it's not a total war game then I don't play it. My favourite civ game happened in civ 5. World map where I from NA had huge world war with Asia. Almost 100 nukes were used in this war, losses were staggering and after a truly long war I won. So much fun!
No matter what‚Äôs going on in the game or my plans, if any other Civ goes fash, they get the Thermonuclear treatment
Me after being invaded by the same country after every 100 years in game (it‚Äôs been 10 turns)
I sadly had to become this in one game I was playing on Civ VI. 

Started off well enough, became a merchant republic. Sadly became landlocked and had to trade for all the valuable materials since I had no access to any of them. Traded with the city states who had the resources. So, I was a peaceful landlocked nation with a good head on science and wealth. So, my neighbors to the north became filthy commies, I then refused to trade with them for I hate dictatorships. I do this in every play through, you go dictatorship I don‚Äôt talk or trade, it‚Äôs either silence, you change or war. So, they denounced me, since they were getting the valuable resources through me.then the Scotts to the Northeast of me became commies, who also traded with me to get those same valuable resources, I refused trade, they denounced me. unbelievably everyone who had me landlocked became filthy commies. So I refused to trade with them. Eventually they all started to wage war on me after denouncing my ‚Äúevil‚Äù ways or some dumb commie shit like that. So, the first to invade came from the North, thankfully they were far behind on the tech tree. Just crossbow men and trebuchets with those long swords men I think. Not much when standing to my muskets and cannons. They were somehow ahead in terms of political tree since I was still a merchant republic. So, the war is going on, I‚Äôm only defending since it‚Äôs literally from all sides. Sadly, my cities were starting to have war weariness. Now I‚Äôm screwed, right. They‚Äôll revolt, but I don‚Äôt wanna back down. So I finally unlock a government on the next tier. I go for the loathed fascism. It‚Äôs so my people don‚Äôt get war-weariness. So, now I‚Äôm the bad guy along with them. And un-fucking-believably the city states somehow decided to stop trading with me!! Now I‚Äôm fucked, those are the valuable resources I need to keep my war machine growing and going!!! We all advanced into the WW2 era units. And holy shit, with all the defensive war I was waging I had some really supped up units and a lot of them. So, what do I do? I take my army that‚Äôs roaming around defending my territory and turn it on the city states for their resources. Slowly but surely I conquer them all, now I have my wealth and resources with no trading. Unbelievably still landlocked, I know, odd, right? Anywho, back to the filthy commies! Now, with my resources secured! My military ever strong, the enemy all around, I head North! To get those that started it all! But as i march upon their country waging war as they were, almost everyone starts to denounce me across the world for razing their cities. Next thing I know the damn Scott allow their country to have open borders with those not on the continent to come in and attack me as well! Sadly, that‚Äôs about as far as the game went since the Xbox One froze and didn‚Äôt allow me to continue any further past a certain turn. So yea, this can happen all too often. I‚Äôd like to say, they started it.
It's all fun and trades until Gilgachad knocks your door
So I wasn‚Äôt going to play tonight. But this made me boot it up lol
The problem with Domination is that I'm too soft. It's one thing if my neighbour is a warmongering asswipe. But if we've been living peacefully for centuries... then pulling the trigger feels wrong.
    Nah, just makes it easier to drop "the big one" and watch them glow...
    What a nice comment xD 
Shows that youre one of the immersive players like me :)
The second half of this meme is actually when you are losing all the wars in your game.
I‚Äôm in this picture and I don‚Äôt like it.

‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶ or do I?
You played civ 4?
    It's just a mistake. Nevermind about it, I just messed up IV and VI and when I realised it's already too late.
Someone needs to check their Roman numerals.
    My bad. A slight oopsie.
VI*
After 200 hours on civ6 I've never won a domination victory.
    I‚Äôve only managed it on Prince.  Nothing higher. I get obliterated if I even think about trying to FA&FO.
Every game I play, the AI declares multiple wars on me and I pulverize them for it. Then I'm the warmonger and get more wars declared on me. It's a good way for me to stay in the lead, but still seems dumb.
Okay this meme has convinced me to finally play it
It‚Äôs ridiculous at the higher difficulties how hard the computer works to make it almost impossible to win on domination.  I‚Äôll play Hammurabi and have flight by like 1500 AD and somehow my neighbors manage to get GDRs by that point
And then there‚Äôs Eleanor of Aquitaine who can get a domination victory ‚Äúin a peaceful way‚Äù.
ü§£
My Research Labs, Military Academies, and Power Plants think you're cute üòçü•∞
Its the only victory as far as im concerned
because of the game doesn‚Äôt build out any of the other types of victories in appealing gameplay. the whole game is really built around military fights
Im on my first game rightnow and im leading with domination, honestly that‚Äôs the best feeling yall can have religion and culture all you want üò≠
My only losses have been to diplomatic and religious victory settings. I turn them off now and play highlander, there can only be one... its a no holds barred ultimate cage match. I always pick Gandhi (cause its funny to watch him fight on diety), and max warring leaders.
I don't recall this from Civ 4
I generally just turn off all the victories and just play until I'm done.

Rarely kill the majority of Civs, or see a victory screen other than the Science one if I'm going for taht.
it's the ONLY victory
It's the only way I play now. Disable all other victory types because on higher difficulties, the AI has so many outrageous boosts it's not even fair. You can only hope to outsmart them militarily, and chances are they will never capture your capital city. My last game was true Earth start, beginning in the Information Era, Diety level, playing as USA. Making sure I was the only civ in the Western Hemisphere so I could settle North & South America all to myself. Spent hundreds of turns building up before I met all the other civs. Conquered Australia and went on to take Asia, India, Africa, and finally Europe all with naval assaults & dozens of aircraft carriers. Most fun game of Civ I've ever played.
wait is this a CIV4 meme or a civ6 meme? 

I have to admit I still play civ4, (BTS) and haven't  grown out of it yet.
    It's a wrong alphabet placement, my bad.
        I thought so. 

  
and here I was all excited. lol
It‚Äôs one of the few things I don‚Äôt like about Civ 6. It‚Äôs almost inevitable that I have to flip to domination, especially on harder difficulties when the AI has such a start on the other victory types. Maybe I‚Äôm just doing it wrong‚Ä¶
Id go for domination victory more often if your units could actually make it to the enemy before they out tech them into irrelevance
I'm a peaceful player, until I recapture a city that another nation took from me and then keep the war going long enough to capture one of theirs in retaliation. Then I'm branded as an aggressor for the rest of the game and it makes me wonder what the point is of trying to get along.
Is it even possible to finish, not even win, a game without a war?

And then when someone fucks around you gotta take all their shit then everyone‚Äôs mad at you so they fuck around‚Ä¶

And 200 turns later you‚Äôre on your 10 domination victory in a row.
This sums up PotatoMcWhiskey in his most recent game as the Inca üòÇ

![gif](giphy|YoVvrLhFLipIhiwFb8|downsized)
The AI only respects strength and build your military to prepare for when they declare war on you.

Gandhi once he gets animal husbandry
Idk, I tend to just try to get the best possible use out of my terrain and civ abilities, and take the victory path of least resistance based on my situation rather than trying to force a specific victory type.

Of course, some civs kinda do just force a victory type, such as Korea always going science, but that‚Äôs aside the point.
One thing about me, I don‚Äôt let shit slide. You attack me once and it‚Äôs inevitable death
Soon as the Panzer's come online, we roll across the continent.
Me when I began was super democratic and nice and good


Me now. Join now! Become a Helldiver!


For managed democracy!
    You sound like you're going through a Donald Trump phase isn't it
        ??? Bro trump is the antithesis to democracy why would I support him
I actually deeply hate domination because it requires too much micro. I‚Äôm a science victory kid through and through, followed by religion (which is domination minus most of the micro).
In order of easiest to hardest, personally I‚Äôve found it to be:

- Diplomatic
- Cultural
- Religious
- Domination
- Science

If you understand how diplomacy works and you make friends with city states build alliances, and participate in emergencies, diplo is super easy to win. So easy I never aim to win that way, but keep up as a backup in case plan A goes south. 

Religious and domination are tedious, but not hard per se. Hardest thing to balance with domination is making the cash flow and science keep up with the war machine. 

science tends to be hardest for me. It kind of depends who is in the game, but it seems that either there will be many civs capable of winning a science victory, or a cultural civ will win before I can get the science victory
Maybe in the next game grievances can take some changes. ‚ÄúWarmongering‚Äù as a status needs to be removed or able to be adjusted using non-combat means. We don‚Äôt see germany or france as modern warmongers because they took land from however many centuries ago, shouldn‚Äôt be that way in civ either
