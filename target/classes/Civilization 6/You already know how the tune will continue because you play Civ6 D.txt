I saw this on insta and this is performed by the youngest MP in New Zealand. If you want to read in detail: https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/meet-new-zealands-youngest-mp-whose-parliamentary-war-cry-went-viral/tewa1dqqo


Turtles shall not provide amenities for 30 turns
    Thank you so much for this comment.
    What‚Äôs the reference?
        Civ 6
    Dead bud, well done.
Are they banning crabs?
    The Immortal God King
    Nah boat Mormons were getting too close again
Imagine that New Zealand is also the first country in human history that has passed a law that forbids buying and selling tobacco after some generation.
They will not have any tobacco!

I will always have profound respect towards the *Haka*!
    They scrapped that idea to fund tax cuts.

Was meant to come into effect July 2024.
        It was a nice idea while it lasted‚Ä¶
        So remember kids: it's your PATRIOTIC DUTY to get addicted to cigarettes, because the government can't balance the budget without it!
            In America, we just replaced booze tax with income tax. 

Of course. Outlawing booze just led to the mob.
        TIL: even New Zeeland is not as ahead of the world as I hoped.
    Are amenities not as important late-game?
        Well, yeah, when everyone and their mother built Entertainment Complexes and Water Parks (and maybe even National Parks to offset all the weariness from your war crimes), amenities become less important.
        Both more and less. If your cities are already all +5 you don't need more, but below that amenities get super important late game.
    We forbid the buying and selling of Alcohol. 

Didn't work.
        Okay but they're completely different. Everyone knows how bad smoking is for you, and after another generation or two it'll likely almost be extinct. Compare that to alcohol in the 1910s and 20s and it's a completely different story lol
            Everyone knew how bad alcohol was for you too. Hence the ban.
                This isn't really true. People kinda knew how bad it was, but not like we think about cigarettes today. People drank all day every day. The US has never sustained the same alcohol consumption per capita ever since prohibition. It may have actually helped stop the rampant alcohol consumption that was going on during the 1910s. Now this isn't to say bans worm, they usually don't. What's best is to set systems up to help people with substance abuse problems. But, I also think a prohibition of tabbacco products, were they to happen, would go a lot better than American prohibition in the 1920s.
    Lol I won't.
    Russia did it too I think new Zealand reversed this
        Russia stopped selling tobacco or alcohol? 
Are we on the same planet?
            There was an attempt at alcohol prohibition in imperial Russia 1914. He didn‚Äôt remain Tsar for long.
    Why is banning tobacco such an admirable thing in your opinion?
        Why is it acceptable for a government to supply society with drugs that:

1) is ruining a persons nerve system 
2) Giving bad breath and is ruining your teeth.
3) Making you less attractive 
4) Making you feel less alive
5) Preventing your nerve system to work properly so it can both share energy and receive energy 
6) Because of no. 1 and 5, You are being sexually handicapped 
7) it‚Äôs expensive and the government as tobacco companies are making profit on you being a ‚Äúcomfortable slave‚Äù for them.
8) It‚Äôs slow death

Take a pick....

Why is it bad for a government to supply an individual or society with something that is virtually worse then Heroine and Cocaine and yet make profit out of it!

Are you for real??
            There‚Äôs a difference between the government SUPPLYING something vs the government not banning something
                Governments have banned Heroine and Cocaine but not tobacco?

Why isn‚Äôt it banned and why shouldn‚Äôt they ban something that‚Äôs equal or worse then that?
Are you getting my point?
                    Heroine and Cocaine are on a much different level of danger for personal and public health than tobacco. If you can‚Äôt see that then I don‚Äôt know what else to tell you
                        The failure of those Heroin and Cocaine bans should be more than enough experience for people to not try it with Cigarettes. The ‚Äúdrug war‚Äù of the Americas (against Cocaine) and of Central Asia (against Heroin and Opium) turned a trade that was killing hundreds of people in to war zones which killed hundreds of thousands of people. There would be no Taliban or international drug cartels without those bans, so yeah it‚Äôs a pretty strong reason not to go down that road. Oh and as an added bonus, after all those regions turned into active war zones and countries spend billions of dollars on militarized police forces, turns out drug usage didn‚Äôt diminish, in fact drug usage is possibly higher now than it was before, so turns out not only is it worse than the alternative, it also just plain doesn‚Äôt work. So yeah prohibition is generally a stupid policy which has no real life success stories and that really should be taken into account when people want to point to other examples and ignore the fact they didn‚Äôt work.
                            Whenever I bring up banning heroines I‚Äôm called sexist.
                    The government should have programs to help people who have become dependent or chemically addicted to substances like heroin or cocaine and provide an avenue for people to acquire those drugs safely and should only ban illicit sales of these drugs. The government is not your parent. People should do whatever they want that doesn't harm others. 

Narco drug gangs hurt others, so make laws to ban sales outside of official distribution channels that can be regulated, but you should never ban the use of them. You turn people with potential health or mental issues into criminals. This is an absurd take you're making. A society should be built on a foundation of liberty, a personal decision that's potentially self-harming is the foundation of liberty. Should the government ban sky-diving, deep-sea diving, caffeine, alcohol, etc? The arguments you're making can apply to so many things.
                    Tobacco users can and regularly live until their 80s/90s, heroin users live like 5 years tops after starting
would love to see ACTUAL Indigenous representation in american congress but i doubt we will ever get solidarity on this level
    I think there are three N.A. Representatives currently in the House. That‚Äôs a little below the percentage of what‚Äôs represented in the national population, but certainly isn‚Äôt nothing. I‚Äôm interpreting the phrase actual representation to mean that there‚Äôs actual representatives rather than widespread membership like seen in New Zealand. I might be misunderstanding you.
        There‚Äôs 4 currently, meaning about 0.9% of the House is Native American and 2.9% of Americans are Native America so it‚Äôs less than half
            Cry.
        The Maori are almost a fifth of the population in New Zealand, there will never be an equivalent in the US. The native people in America are also a lot more diverse than the Maori.
    As an American I'd like to see that too, but the American Congress is just not a representative body of the indigenous people. The natives were purposely excluded for all of our shared history. They remain largely excluded.

Native Americans have every right to say they are not us, and they certainly say it with pride.
        we sure do. üñ§
    Little late but the secretary of the interior is Native American. We‚Äôre making slow progress.
        we will get there one day brother ‚úäüèæ
Our biology teacher in high school was a musician who travelled all around the world and beat cancer with very low odds more than once. At the end of the lesson he either showed us music from around the world, did a meditation session or made us do a MƒÅori haka together to lift our spirits up.

He's an incredible man and I always have fond memories of him.
    That would definitely have lifted my spirits up. Next class is math. (Does Haka) LET'S GO DO SOME MATH! GET SOME!
That‚Äôs pretty cool. And makes me glad to love this game even more. Always loved that chant in-game.
I was just in New Zealand a couple weeks ago, and I went to a replication of a MƒÅori village. I actually recognize several of the people in the gallery in this clip from that village! Small world.
    Small country. NZ has fewer people than just Melbourne.
![gif](giphy|Fq9Jnf1E6tTvlShmZx|downsized)
    That‚Äôs amazing
I love people being people. No sarcasm. We're such a cool species and I love this shit!
Holy fuck that‚Äôs obnoxious
I am officially scared of New-Zeeland now.
    I was scared of them to begin with. Mordor is not a nice place, precious.
I always think of the scene from Indiana Jones when the guy pulls out the sword and flails it around like crazy then Indy just shoots him dead. I imagine that‚Äôs how it played out when Europeans first arrived in New Zealand to colonize it and saw the MƒÅori trying to intimidate them with the haka dance
    Well, many of those Europeans probably also had diarrhea that day as well.
This makes me feel so cringe.
    It's okay kiddo, high school doesn't last forever, you'll get better.
Super annoying
    Great job mate. Really shows off how hard you are.

                    5000 BC? The MƒÅori originated 700 years ago in the hemisphere that‚Äôs 98% ocean. Then again, as someone with as shallow of an understanding of history as someone who perpetuates the ‚ÄúFrench are cowards‚Äù myth, you probably didn‚Äôt know that. 

Also, France is one of, if not the winningest militaries in the world. They know war.

    Shut up. Respect their culture
        I mean, it's fine for them to not like it. We all have our own preferences. It just means they have bad taste.
            It‚Äôs not a matter of ‚Äútaste‚Äù or ‚Äúliking it,‚Äù it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs been passed down their culture for generations upon generations. It‚Äôs downright important for them.
        But the eyes are scary. Admit it üòÜ
            It is intentionally scary‚Ä¶it‚Äôs supposed to strike fear‚Ä¶
                It definitely works. It's really cool that such an old piece of culture has survived into the modern day. I should look into the history of it. Who were they trying to scare?
                    If I recall correctly, it‚Äôs ceremonially/symbolically scaring the ‚Äúenemy‚Äù. In rugby, they perform before matches to scare the opponent
                Well thats just adorable
                Supposed to strike fear but induced cringe lmao
                    If you have the maturity of a middle schooler I guess...
                        And why is that buddy
                            Probably because you are a middle schooler.
        Nope it's annoying.
        These are annoying as fuck
        This is such an embarrassingly dumb take you can respect someone's culture and still find it annoying also where is the line on just shut up and respect their culture there are some objectively some barbaric cultural practices around in the world today, do we have just shut up and respect every aspect of every culture
            > do we have just shut up and respect every aspect of every culture

I mean, the ones that objectively don‚Äôt harm anyone? Why not?
    You can always disable Kupe in your game
Shut up Jesus
    Don‚Äôt tell Jesus to shut up heretic
    Yeah I deleted the MƒÅori song files from my game for this reason. No disrespect to the culture but it‚Äôs not a chill song to play Civ and vibe when it plays for like 30 minutes straight
        Thank you, didn't know it was an option.
So cringe.

Very crazy eyes


I'm sure her enemies will piss their pants in second hand embarrassment when seeing this
    Real mature and respectful. Maybe just let people have and enjoy their cultures? You know, like how many others do for yours?
        What do you know about daydreamingsentry that you can assume his cultural background?
            If I have to be honest, I took a bit of a gamble based on my experience with people both online and in person. I, as someone from eastern North-America, have encountered a disheartening number of people who blatantly and thoughtlessly disrespect other cultures, typically from cultures or religion that are held in high regard in my area. That isn‚Äôt to say everyone from those cultures/religions are like that, but I‚Äôve rarely met anyone meeting the criteria of ‚Äúdisrespect asshole‚Äù who wasn‚Äôt
A 21 year old running things is scary enough!
    Yeah god forbid they respect and highlight their culture too
        All I see is a child making a TikTok video for some extra attention
    Better than the 80 year olds we have in the US with no stake in the future.
[removed]
    Like American politicians do with religion, right?
    It's fine for you to not like it, but calling them *backward for having an old musical tradition* is ridiculous.
    Can you explain how a society remembering and respecting cultural traditions is backward? Enabling people to celebrate their diverse cultural identity is a sign of a mature progressive society.
    it shouldn‚Äôt surprise anyone that this dude believes in Great Replacement theory, thinks there‚Äôs nothing wrong with a 26 year old woman raping a 16 year old (because ‚Äúin some states the age of consent is 16‚Äù and because ‚Äúit‚Äôs impossible for a woman to rape a man‚Äù), is a Lost Causer, and believes the Union side of the Civil War was ‚Äúgenocidal‚Äù (unlike the Confederates)
        also spends a crazy amount of time on reddit for someone who claims to be of ‚Äúthe working class‚Äù
        Thanks for the compliments. Would you like to spend more time reading my comments? I love my fans.
    can you explain how what you saw in the video makes their culture backwards?
        He's a typical republican nazi. He won't answer this cause he's scared of getting banned.

Both more and less. If your cities are already all +5 you don't need more, but below that amenities get super important late game.
Okay but they're completely different. Everyone knows how bad smoking is for you, and after another generation or two it'll likely almost be extinct. Compare that to alcohol in the 1910s and 20s and it's a completely different story lol

        This isn't really true. People kinda knew how bad it was, but not like we think about cigarettes today. People drank all day every day.

Why is it acceptable for a government to supply society with drugs that:

1) is ruining a persons nerve system 
2) Giving bad breath and is ruining your teeth.
3) Making you less attractive 
4) Making you feel less alive
5) Preventing your nerve system to work properly so it can both share energy and receive energy 
6) Because of no. 1 and 5, You are being sexually handicapped 
7) it‚Äôs expensive and the government as tobacco companies are making profit on you being a ‚Äúcomfortable slave‚Äù for them.
8) It‚Äôs slow death

Take a pick....

Why is it bad for a government to supply an individual or society with something that is virtually worse then Heroine and Cocaine and yet make profit out of it!

Are you for real??
    There‚Äôs a difference between the government SUPPLYING something vs the government not banning something
        Governments have banned Heroine and Cocaine but not tobacco?

Why isn‚Äôt it banned and why shouldn‚Äôt they ban something that‚Äôs equal or worse then that?
Are you getting my point?
            Heroine and Cocaine are on a much different level of danger for personal and public health than tobacco. If you can‚Äôt see that then I don‚Äôt know what else to tell you
                The failure of those Heroin and Cocaine bans should be more than enough experience for people to not try it with Cigarettes. The ‚Äúdrug war‚Äù of the Americas (against Cocaine) and of Central Asia (against Heroin and Opium) turned a trade that was killing hundreds of people in to war zones which killed hundreds of thousands of people. There would be no Taliban or international drug cartels without those bans, so yeah it‚Äôs a pretty strong reason not to go down that road. Oh and as an added bonus, after all those regions turned into active war zones and countries spend billions of dollars on militarized police forces, turns out drug usage didn‚Äôt diminish, in fact drug usage is possibly higher now than it was before, so turns out not only is it worse than the alternative, it also just plain doesn‚Äôt work. So yeah prohibition is generally a stupid policy which has no real life success stories and that really should be taken into account when people want to point to other examples and ignore the fact they didn‚Äôt work.
                    Whenever I bring up banning heroines I‚Äôm called sexist.
            The government should have programs to help people who have become dependent or chemically addicted to substances like heroin or cocaine and provide an avenue for people to acquire those drugs safely and should only ban illicit sales of these drugs. The government is not your parent. People should do whatever they want that doesn't harm others. 

Narco drug gangs hurt others, so make laws to ban sales outside of official distribution channels that can be regulated, but you should never ban the use of them. You turn people with potential health or mental issues into criminals. This is an absurd take you're making. A society should be built on a foundation of liberty, a personal decision that's potentially self-harming is the foundation of liberty. Should the government ban sky-diving, deep-sea diving, caffeine, alcohol, etc? The arguments you're making can apply to so many things.
            Tobacco users can and regularly live until their 80s/90s, heroin users live like 5 years tops after starting
There‚Äôs 4 currently, meaning about 0.9% of the House is Native American and 2.9% of Americans are Native America so it‚Äôs less than half
    Cry.
The Maori are almost a fifth of the population in New Zealand, there will never be an equivalent in the US. The native people in America are also a lot more diverse than the Maori.
we sure do. üñ§

Also, France is one of, if not the winningest militaries in the world. They know war.
I mean, it's fine for them to not like it. We all have our own preferences. It just means they have bad taste.
    It‚Äôs not a matter of ‚Äútaste‚Äù or ‚Äúliking it,‚Äù it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs been passed down their culture for generations upon generations. It‚Äôs downright important for them.
But the eyes are scary. Admit it üòÜ
    It is intentionally scary‚Ä¶it‚Äôs supposed to strike fear‚Ä¶
        It definitely works. It's really cool that such an old piece of culture has survived into the modern day. I should look into the history of it. Who were they trying to scare?
            If I recall correctly, it‚Äôs ceremonially/symbolically scaring the ‚Äúenemy‚Äù. In rugby, they perform before matches to scare the opponent
        Well thats just adorable

                And why is that buddy
                    Probably because you are a middle schooler.
Nope it's annoying.
These are annoying as fuck
This is such an embarrassingly dumb take you can respect someone's culture and still find it annoying also where is the line on just shut up and respect their culture there are some objectively some barbaric cultural practices around in the world today, do we have just shut up and respect every aspect of every culture
    > do we have just shut up and respect every aspect of every culture

I mean, the ones that objectively don‚Äôt harm anyone? Why not?
Thank you, didn't know it was an option.

    If I have to be honest, I took a bit of a gamble based on my experience with people both online and in person. I, as someone from eastern North-America, have encountered a disheartening number of people who blatantly and thoughtlessly disrespect other cultures, typically from cultures or religion that are held in high regard in my area. That isn‚Äôt to say everyone from those cultures/religions are like that, but I‚Äôve rarely met anyone meeting the criteria of ‚Äúdisrespect asshole‚Äù who wasn‚Äôt
All I see is a child making a TikTok video for some extra attention
also spends a crazy amount of time on reddit for someone who claims to be of ‚Äúthe working class‚Äù
Thanks for the compliments. Would you like to spend more time reading my comments? I love my fans.
He's a typical republican nazi. He won't answer this cause he's scared of getting banned.
In America, we just replaced booze tax with income tax. 

Of course. Outlawing booze just led to the mob.
Everyone knew how bad alcohol was for you too. Hence the ban.
    This isn't really true. People kinda knew how bad it was, but not like we think about cigarettes today. People drank all day every day. The US has never sustained the same alcohol consumption per capita ever since prohibition. It may have actually helped stop the rampant alcohol consumption that was going on during the 1910s. Now this isn't to say bans worm, they usually don't. What's best is to set systems up to help people with substance abuse problems. But, I also think a prohibition of tabbacco products, were they to happen, would go a lot better than American prohibition in the 1920s.
There was an attempt at alcohol prohibition in imperial Russia 1914. He didn‚Äôt remain Tsar for long.
