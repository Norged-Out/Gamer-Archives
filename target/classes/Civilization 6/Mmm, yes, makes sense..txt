[[Mmm, yes, makes sense.]]





I've always hated this about the AI. 

I had a rival civ settle aggressively near me, then declare a surprise war. I was suzerain of 2 nearby city states so they were crushed.

The rest of the game I had the AI hating me. I feel like the grievances and weariness from war should be halved if you're the defender.

Also annoying when the AI tries to convert me to their religion, then ignores me when I ask them not to, but I get a ton of grievances generated when I do it back to them.
    Wow, never seen/read/heard such a severe case XD
    I feel you man. I get the hate when I‚Äôm doing really well but that‚Äôs when you can expect a war, even if grievances are at a minimum. Perhaps it has more to do with the difficulty your on? I usually play king, sometimes higher if I‚Äôm doing military victory or science and the second largest and smallest civs usually team up.
    I've just started playing civ6. I've read about war weariness. But can you explain it to me again?
        Essentially the longer you are at war, the more unhappy your population becomes, which lowers your amenities.
            Or play as Macedon, they don‚Äôt even know what wat weariness is.
                I've just won my first domination victory using Macedon. But what are amenities? What do they do? How do we get them?

Essentially it's a measure of your Civilisations happiness. You get amenities from entertainment districts, luxuries, civics, some wonders and certain tile features.

The more amenities a city has the more productive it is and you get a boost to each tiles output. If amenities drop too low in a city it will lose production, output and loyalty. If loyalty drops too much a city can rebel.
                    Oh really? It even affects to production? This is definitely new information to me 

Thanks for answering me.
                        Well, not a cities total production, but the production yield from tiles the city controls. So it can have a serious impact.

It's definitely worth planning where you can put entertainment districts and water parks to maximise the amenities you get from them.
    I just take it as the more hate I‚Äôm getting, the better I‚Äôm doing.
There's a limit to how aggressively you can counter-attack without generating grievances.  If a civ settles near me aggressively and starts a war, I often wipe them off the continent because I don't want to deal with them being dicks the whole game.  But you generate huge grievances for that.
    I'm a fan of clearing the continent as early as possible.

I'll deal with the fallout later. I don't play nice in the sandbox.
        By the time the Civs from the other continent discover me, I'm dabbing my mouth with a napkin and saying, "Nope nobody else here but us."
        There‚Äôs nothing quite as satisfying as winning a free unit battering ram and wiping out the first capital you see within 10 turns.
        I can‚Äôt ever play nice with most civs especially if we share a continent. They always try to settle right beside my cities or inside my borders, cutting me off from my other cities. Usually I clear them first.
    here‚Äôs the thing. they started denouncing me when the civ was *non-existent*
        As far as I'm concerned I should be able to commit whatever atrocities I want on Civs the other AIs don't know about, or that are gone from the game.
            Is there a mod to patch that up?
That‚Äôs why I stopped playing.
Too much unbalance in the AI.
Sucks because it‚Äôs a good game, but the AI is stupid as fuck.
Game wants you to fight back but just kill some units and make peace. So they can reproduce and attack you again. Best AI ever!
    Gets pissed off and declares war, not a single thing happens on either side, 10 turns pass, make peace lmao
100%. Huge flaw in the AI
Wondered this! 
I had one declare war on me, then literally did nothing... I started bombarding one of their cities with a sub & missile cruiser, and they wanted peace all of a sudden... they never attacked me... I was extremely confused. üò≥
Yes ‚Äúdefending‚Äù by taking their cities.

I defend the local jewelry by taking all their gold before criminals can do that.
General rule of thumb - if you find a civ settle upto 10 blocks from your capital city early game. Waging early war and clearing them out is the way to go 99% of the time.
Well they know that you are superior and maybe even waited for an attack. But using this initial aggression to wipe out the other civ, does enrage other civs.

I know exactly how you feel and what you experience. But honestly, sometimes their response is justified.
The other civs need to learn to not start a war they can‚Äôt finish
