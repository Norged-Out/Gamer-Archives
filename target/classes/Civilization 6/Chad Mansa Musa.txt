[[Chad Mansa Musa]]





The most broken game I've played of CIV6 was with Mansa, I had something like 10k gpt, and 5k faith per turn.

Kept very little military because I'd been peaceful with everyone possible, one of my rivals declared war because they thought I was weak.

Next turn I bought military units in every city and Dock, ended up with double their military power. Did the same for the next 3 turns and my gold income was barely impacted.

It was a very brief war.
    Sounds like my games with Portugal. I’ll have to try mansa now
        Now, who would win between Joao III and Mansa Mussa? The battle of gold! 

(In fact, IMO, it would be Joao III. Science+gold is more useful than faith+gold, and I felt that racking up gold with Portugal was easier than with Mansa Mussa).
Civilization Name: Amazon Inc.

Civ ability: Anti-competitive Practices - +100 gold per turn per neighborhood upon discovery of the internet. Great Merchants can establish corporations without being consumed and pillage other civs corporations without war or open borders. All corporations provide +15% gold to the host city.

Special Unit: Delivery Van - Replaces Trader - +1 tourism and +5 gold to starting city.

Special Building: Fulfillment Center - Replaces Shopping Mall - +2 Amenities from entertainment, +3 production per turn per housing of the neighborhood, and +10 tourism. 

Leader: Jeff Bezos

Leader Ability: Kneepad Supremacist - +1 Trade Route capacity per city with a neighborhood. Trade Routes production cost cut by 50% and routes are completed 50% faster.
    That sounds fun. If only there were an economic victory condition…
        They all are 😉
    I wonder if there's a sub to ideate custom civs like this one.
    I'm pretty sure it reduces tourism consider that it kills city centers.
If you go all the way towards Venture Politics as Mansa Musa, you can play Corporate Libertarianism and basically become a modern billionaire
Maybe I should play again as Mansa Musa. Start on hot map, focused on Science Victory, and buy yourself to space
    You can also bankrupt your opponents by offering them loans.
        We can offer loans?!
            Not officially but what you can do is offer to give them say 1000 gold upfront for 50 gold per turn for 30 turns and unless they've denounced you they'll always accept.
                This is hilarious and I never would’ve tried it. Thank you
Did someone just watch this episode of ERB and decide to meme it?
I'm gonna do a gaje with Mansa Muss with an unlimited gold cheat to get the full experience
Wallah by the holy quaran i lay my hand upon
Ah yes, Mansa Musa was such a good person!

Ignore that he made most of his wealth by selling his border rivals into slavery to Europeans and heavily influencing the initial supply that would lead to a four hundred year era of African slavery.

Totally good dude.
    >lead to a four hundred year era of African slavery

African slavery as we know it started in 1483 in São Tomé. That was the blueprint for the entire transatlantic slave trade (i.e. the 400 year period you're talking about).

Slaves during Mansa Musa's time were not chattel slaves like the ones sent to the Americas. One major difference being that children of slaves in Mali were not considered slaves, nor were slaves considered "sub-human" and barred from education.

In many ways, Mali slavery more closely resembles serfdom. The closest you get to modern slavery in Mali is their trading of slaves which also wasn't to Europe but mostly North Africa and the Middle East so I'm not sure why you said it was Europeans who were buying them. Most European slaves at that time were actually Slavs and people from where modern day Russia occupies today.
    And he's such a nice guy he donates so much gold that it crashes everyone's economy.  Thanks a bunch dude.
Time to make Jeff Bezos mod for Civ 6 ! 
/s
>Ayo Lex Loser, you look like a villian at comic con you gettin' ate up you should've battled me on Ramadan! a harem of women is what i had on my staff you married one woman, jeff and she cut you IN HALF!!!!!! -Mansa Musa
    Bums me out they rarely release new battles anymore.
The picture of Mansa Musa here is in Civ IV, not Civ VI, which says a lot when he gets two games and Bezos gets zero.
Also singlehandedly crashed the entire economy of Africa
    That's debated and certainly not of entire Africa, that was only said for Egypt.
If you think Jeff Bezos is *not* “incomprehensibly rich”, then you do not comprehend how rich he is.
Both slave owners
Wouldn’t want to play that dweeb Bezos anyway. #weirdosimulator
Not only was musa worth that much but he was worth that much when pretty much no billionaires if any existed anywhere on Earth. Hell most if any governments didn’t even have a $1 billion gdp. This was like 200 years before the Spanish empire which peaked at $23 billion and was literally the richest country in Europe. Today Manusa Wouldn’t be impossibly wealthy (hes only about twice as wealthy as elon musk and Bill gates would be worth at-least twice Musa if he never sold his Microsoft stock.) but it would be like if the Richest man today had about 20x more money than the richest government.
