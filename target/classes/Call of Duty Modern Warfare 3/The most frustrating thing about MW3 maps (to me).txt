[[The most frustrating thing about MW3 maps (to me)]]





This is why I thought sitrep should highlight air support in red just like it does for *all other enemy equipment*. 
    never thought of that, but that would be a great feature
    Agreed with this somewhat. Personally I think that they integrated the UAVs perfectly into the game. In BO and MW3 you could take out a UAV  with a launcher in seconds, making it technically useless. 

There are so many counter-actions you could do against a UAV.

Switch to an assassin class. 
Earn a sam turrent.
Hell, earn a counter-UAV. 


    I may be wrong, but I thought I saw someone's Trophy System that was not lit up with Sit-Rep once. People rarely use that though, so I haven't been able to confirm...
        Trophy system is lit up.  All I play is domination so I see these all the time...
            That makes sense. I actually haven't played domination even once on MW3! I don't even have a reason... Anyway I guess I was wrong.
        Does a teammate's equipment light up? It may not have been an enemy's trophy system. Also if you only saw it briefly it may have been broken.
    Enemy equipment is different from killstreak rewards.
        But it still highlights IMS', sentry guns, and decoy packages, all of which are killstreak rewards.
Don't have a stinger:  Right fucking above me.

Have a stinger:  On the other side of the Dome/Building/Bridge, pretty much making me run out into the open to shoot it down.
This is the case on every map. I'll look around and never find it, but if I set up my SAM, he finds it immediately hiding behind a cloud. I suspect maybe they did this on purpose since they knew more people would be shooting them down to add to their pointstreaks.
My friend complains about this. He's a non reditor, and he said, "The buildings are too damn high!"

He didn't understand my laughter.
behind the MOUNTAIN on outpost is the worst... or maybe it doest go behind the mountain and i just cant see it because of all the snow?

trees on village should not block my stinger from locking onto a uav either.
My thoughts on this are that if I can't see it, it shouldn't see me. IMO the UAV should only show you on the radar if it has a direct line of sight to you. 
    I always wondered why our team doesn't just give a Stinger to the guy on the radio who says "Enemy UAV spotted." He apparently can see them all the time, he should be fucking shooting them down! I'm down here with a shotgun and C4 strapped to my chest dealing with these assholes on the ground!
        I had a semi-related thought to that.  The teammates in the campaign will always call out enemies with their locations: "Enemies to the east!  Behind the cars!"

Why can't the radio voice do that?  "Enemy UAV identified to your east."  Or whichever direction.  You get the point.
    That would be *too realistic* and make *too much sense*... we are talking about CoD, right?!

In all honesty, I think this is a great idea and I have mentioned it before... but then UAV would be practically worthless on all of these maps. It is *really annoying* though. The smoggy/cloudy skies and tall buildings make it a pain to shoot UAVs down sometimes. 
        >but then UAV would be practically worthless on all of these maps.

I think the mechanic would have to change a bit. Instead of the blinking, sonar like coverage on the map, it could show anyone in view as a constant dot, while anyone hidden from the view of the UAV would disappear from the map. 
            That is a brilliant idea and I would welcome that change.  It would also make Assassin less widespread if people just went inside while UAVs were up.

That would also allow for a higher-level pointstreak: a thermal UAV (or something like that).  Sweeps like the old one did but would show people inside buildings, too.
    So it would be like a high flying recon drone?
        Didn't think about it that way. Kinda. But targets ALL visible enemies, not just the one its pointing at. They would go off the radar the minute they hid instead of staying painted. I would also make it a red dot, not an arrow like the recon drone. 
I just went on a rant about this yesterday. Why do they even make them destroyable when you can't target them half the time, let alone even FIND them on half of the maps.
what's also ridiculous is how there are tall buildings in mw3 multiplayer that block your stinger but practically none of the maps except maybe Bakaara allow for vertical play...
is that downtown chicago?

Is there a reason why everyone seems to prefer the stinger over any other launcher?

I have the smaw equipped on almost all classes simply because besides taking down UAVs I can also blast rockets right into enemies, which is quite entertaining.
    The Stinger has more than one shot and locks on very fast.
Completely agree! This drives me nuts!
Thank god, I thought only I had that problem
UAVs are almost obsolete. Without any more unlimited Sprint, fast classes are useless so pretty much everyone is using assassin. I rely on my sitrep to find people, hardly look at HUD anymore 
    fast classes define the akimbo fmg8, and shotgun classes. most of the time, I've found that killing gives me plenty enough time to charge my sprint
        They're awful compared to smg/unlimited sprint in blops or the commando marathon in mw2.
            While I sort of agree about blops, the maps in mw3 are smaller so marathon is not very useful in this game. This is why soh and ass are pretty much what everyone uses.
    No way. P90 with Extended Mags and Extreme Conditioning/Quickdraw/Stalker (or Steady Aim) is amazingly powerful.
    Unless you are playing game modes where assassin is not nearly as valuable as the other perks.
All the time...Tip: They fly in FRONT of the buildings, not above or behind...still dam near impossible to see

        You have????
            I have too.
                Ok I stand corrected, Appologies. I've only (If can I find them that is) ever seen them in Front of the Buildings about 3/4 down from the top.
    I'm pretty sure this is incorrect. I have never seen a UAV between myself and anything else in any of the games, and I shoot them down as often as possible. I think you are confusing the [UAV](http://callofduty.wikia.com/wiki/UAV_Recon) with the [Remote Recon drone](http://callofduty.wikia.com/wiki/Recon_Drone), which can go anywhere.
        Yeah from his comments that's what I was thinking too. I'm adding some footage of them in-game for him to check.

        I've seen it happen on Hardhat. It doesn't fly in front of all of them though.
            you'll see them go behind buildings on arkarden and downturn. im sure they do it on other maps too.
