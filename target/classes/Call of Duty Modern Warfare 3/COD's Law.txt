[[COD's Law]]


COD's Law (aka Murphy's Law for Call of Duty) is a law that states:

>Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.

* If an enemy player gets a Predator Missile, he will single you out. It doesn't matter if you're on your own. It doesn't matter if the rest of your team mates are huddled together on the other side of the map. The enemy player isn't interested in getting a triple kill or a multi kill. He's only interesting in getting **you**.
* A Predator Missile is in the air and you have Blind Eye equipped. Cool, right? Wrong. The enemy player will ignore the red squares and instead, opt for the greyed-out figure that he sees moving in the corner of his screen. That, or one of your team mates will try to escape the Predator Missile by sprinting towards you. 
* The second I decide to reload or check my back, somebody will come running around that corner with akimbo FMGs. It happens every single time and I never learn.
* If I throw down a care package, somebody will steal it from me, regardless of where I've placed it or how attentively I am guarding it. Call of Duty will always find a way to take it from me. Unless its a UAV. Then I can keep it.
* If I'm one kill away from winning a game of FFA and I happen to get killed, I will be spawned at the edge of the map, far away from everybody. My opponent, who is one kill behind me, will be spawned smack bang in the middle of things. Quickscopers and players using pistols-only will magically appear in front of his sight-lines.
* I'm watching a doorway because I'm 100% sure that somebody is inside and that he or she will come barging out at any moment.... I spend 10 seconds aiming down my sights, yet nobody appears. I start to doubt myself. Did I really see that red dot on my radar? Maybe he left via another exit? What if he intends to stay in there for the entire game? And what if somebody has crept up on me while I was too busy focusing on the doorway? My doubts get the better of me and I check my back. Nobody is there. Time to turn back around and focus my attention on the doorway agaiOH FUCK HE'S GOT A STRIKER
* Four enemy players have their backs to me. Either I'll panic, miss and run out of bullets before I kill the second guy or I'll be blown up by an exploding car as I try to get closer.
* I'm playing Infected and I'm holding down an area with my team mates. A lone infected player comes running around the corner and nobody seems to notice him. He breaks through the wall of SMG-wielding players that are surrounding me and focuses all of his efforts on infecting me with a 2-meter knife lunge.
* 2 kills away from a MOAB? Host Migration will fail.
* Your team mates are closer to the enemy? Doesn't matter. You'll be killed first anyway.
* An enemy chopper is in the air and you're trying to lock onto it with your Stinger. You'll spend 10 seconds waiting for it to reappear as it ducks behind tall buildings, only to be shot in the back as soon as you have a clear shot.
* Your attack chopper will fly around taking aerial photographs while you're on a killstreak. As soon as you die and your streak is over, it'll go into beast mode and take out everyone on the opposite team.
* You pick up a weapon that you don't normally use and beast with it. You equip it on one of your classes and you go 1-5 in the first minute.
* You decide to swap your claymore for some semtex. Half-way through the next game, you forget about the change and try to set down a claymore. You throw semtex at the floor and are forced to make a frantic dash to escape the blast.
* You decide to swap your semtex for a claymore. Half-way through the next game, you see a group of enemies. You decide to throw a semtex grenade at them, only to take out a claymore and get killed while you're still clutching it in your hands.
* You get into a close gunfight and you need to reload. Instead of wasting your time with the reload animation, you decide to switch to your secondary weapon. Unfortunately for you, you recently selected the Stinger as your secondary.
* You get a UAV and instinctively call it in. An enemy Counter UAV was already up.
* Patiently flank the enemy team. Your team mates spawn beside you.
* You run around the corner and your team mate is there, milliseconds away from capturing a decoy care package.
* Cooking a grenade? It'll bounce off the frame of the door and come right back at you.


Your knife is a floppy purple dildo.
The enemies are carrying 6-foot long samurai swords.

No exceptions.
    now I have to play some saints row the third.
    The penetrator!
        The **PURPLE** penetrator!
    **PURPLE** the man said.  Be specific.
    This may be the most upvoted comment in this entire subreddit.
The enemy's flash grenade misses by a mile but manages to white out your entire screen for eternity. Your flash grenade explodes directly in the enemy's face, his screen is slightly cloudy in the kill cam.
    Every. single.time. 
    Actually, the kill cam shows his current blindness in real time, not how white his screen was when he killed you. It's the same problem that occurred in Black Ops, where you get killed through smoke or fire and the kill cam shows it perfectly clear.
        Are you sure? Because ive seen killcams completly white-screen
            Yes I'm sure.  In those cases, they may have still been flashed.  I know I've gotten a few kills while completely whitescreened before, it's more luck and guessing where they're coming from then any real skill though.
> Four enemy players have their backs to me. Either I'll panic, miss and run out of bullets before I kill the second guy or I'll be blown up by an exploding car as I try to get closer.  
  
  Spread damage evenly across all four players, killing none.
    Always. I end up not killing any of them, because I get too excited and want to kill every single one of them.
        On the rare occasion I get smart and throw C4 at them. Of course the norm for me is not being able to decide which to kill first and carefully shooting in between all of them.
            I toss the C4 killing them... and myself.
                Oh yes, that happens more often that not too.
                I toss the c4 and they shoot it up in my face
    Usually because aim assist starts playing tug of war and you can never stay on target long enough to finish them off, despite the 6 hit markers per enemy.
        Lol, aim assist. 
            i love you.
                I know you do baby.
            Lol, difference between quick movement of mouse and one click and sensitivity of two different analog stick to keep your aim perfect ... you're cool. 
    Seconds before firing on your first victim team Predator Missile trolls in and kills them all...
        Or the opposite. You are about to get a triple or quad kill with a Predator Missle and a teammate/s kills them all.
    YES YES YES.  That. 
    Your about to start laying them out and you get instantly knifed from behind
        >Your about to start laying them out and you get instantly knifed from a spawn behind you
    Or get excited and shoot in the exact centre of all of them... hitting none.
    Or. See two enemys standing about 2 feet away from each other, both looking directly at you. You start shooting between them and they both kill you after you finish shooting your entire clip into the wall behind them.
every single fucking point. truer truths have never been told.  
  
bookmarked. i want to read this again when i'm drunk.
    When I first started playing and had bad games I brushed it off because I was having fun.

Now when these things happen to me I get frustrated. For example the MW3 on PC crashed twice on me today causing me to lose challenges, achievements, and XP.

You know you're playing too much when fun turns into frustration every single time.
    Hell I am drunk now.
        dude!  read it again!
        same.
Also, if there's a 2 maps you like that are being voted for in the lobby, more people will come in the lobby and the maps will change to 2 you hate.
    This needs to be up there.
* You epuip scavenger because you hate picking up other weapons? You'll get killed while reloading every. Single. Time. Equip SoH because you're sick of getting killed while reloading? You'll waste ALL your bullets on hitmarkers.

* You, and only you, will always be the only one that tries taking out air support. If you don't, the enemy team will have every conceivable combination of killstreak up at all times, for their full durations.
    >* You, and only you, will always be the only one that tries taking out air support. If you don't, the enemy team will have every conceivable combination of killstreak up at all times, for their full durations.

Addendum: The second your killstreak is announced you hear 6 Stinger missiles and a SAM turret firing and it is brought down before it knew it was alive.
    About the enemy air support:
"If i pick up a class that doesnt have a Stinger, none of my teammates will take down a helicopter. The moment i swap my class for the one with a Stinger, the helicopter either goes, or another teammate finally decudes to take it down"
    > You, and only you, will always be the only one that tries taking out air support. If you don't, the enemy team will have every conceivable combination of killstreak up at all times, for their full durations.

This one drive me crazy. I almost always have stinger equipped and take out everything. The second I actually try and have some fun with a different secondary, NO ONE on my team will take out a stinger. Drives me fucking crazy. 

Four team mates behind you

Okay they got my back

Gets killed from behind, rest of team survives.
    Frequently this.

No telling how many times on ANY fPS.
You trust those random fucks behind you or in the same room to watch your ass and they decide to circle jerk the exact moment enemy comes knocking.
USE YOUR DAMN EYES.
HOW THE FUCK DID HE EVEN MAKE IT AROUND THE CORNER, LET ALONE IN THE GODDAMN ROOM WITH 3 OF YOU WATCHING THE SAME FUCKING DOOR?
HERE I AM KILLING EVERYTHING THAT COMES THROUGH 2 DOORS.
        FOR FUCKING REAL TEAM!?! WHAT ON GODS GREEN BEAUTIFUL EARTH WERE YOU THINKING? FUCKING EYES, USE EM, FUCKING TRIGGER FINGER, USE IT. GOD FUCKING DAMN CAN ONLY I KILL? 

Looks at score board, they only have two total kills combined, you have six.


            I have no shit been knifed in the back in a room full of teammates.

Only I have eyes and only I have names that appear red.
            I can't even count the number of times I've checked the leaderboard on search, thinking wtf is going on here, only to see that I've got twice as many kills as everyone else on my team combined.  The worst part being that I usually only have around six or seven.
Playing Domination, everyone else is playing team death match.
Playing Capture the Flag, everyone else is playing team death match.
Playing Sabatoge, everyone else is playing team death match.
Play Team Death match, everyone is camping.
    Very well put, I can really appreciate this.
You pick up a weapon that you don't normally use and beast with it. You equip it on one of your classes and you go 1-5 in the first minute.

If I got a dime every time that happened in a COD game, it would total MW3s sales.
    This his me more than any of the other obvious ones. 
    Yes. 

**WHAT FOUL MAGIC IS THIS??**
    And the most frustrating one: You ask a dude if you can give him sweet felatio, but he declines. 
        Yes. That is troublesome.

ಠ_ಠ
        I cracked up...but you still get downvotes.
        *fellatio
Team mates will get Reaper's, AC-130's and Osprey's in Care Packages.

You get UAV's and IMS's.

When you do get one of those awesome killstreaks in a Care Package, you die before you can reach it and one of the retards on your team saves it. By save it, i mean they get an AC-130 on Village and don't get a single fucking kill from it.
    or when you do get an awesome kill streak reward from a care package there's 30 seconds left in the game. also can someone please tell me what the ims does?
        it gets destroyed and the enemy +1s their pointstreak
            Both of the above are accurate descriptions.

                Not true... Enemy IMS' will murder your teammates ruthlessly.
        It is a motion-based explosive. When an enemy runs by it, it shoots some sort of grenade at them. Unfortunately, Stalker Pro cancels it out and it is easy to destroy. 

A well-placed one, with a little luck, can be quite good for someone.
            I've gotten 3 or 4 kills at choke points with it. 
                place it above the pipes on hardhat during a domination match and watch the glory ;-)
                    The camp spot above the pipe from c to b? 
                        Yes - most ppl get nuked leaving the pipe or rushing from B to C
            It effectively shoots a souped up bouncing betty into the air and kills everything in a 20-30 ft radius.
        kills the enemy, no matter where they go, no matter how low they drop, no matter how fast they run.
            Ah actually to survive the ims every time you must lay down with the center of your body in the middle of the ims and it won't kill you. Just start shooting or knifing and destroy it while it tries to kill you and you laugh because you just learned how to beat the IMS :D
                Or, Sitrep Pro + EMP :)
                    But if you use my technique you can have dead silence :) I love emp nades though!
        It's a bouncing betty with longer range which can get off four shots. Sucks when you use it, but when the enemy does it is guaranteed to get constant double kills as everyone runs through the same door. 
Also, it will probably kill you once, you will then come back to the same place an age later, expecting someone will have destroyed it by now, only to be killed again.

Picked up a gun by accident? Yours is now under a huge pile of guns
    And you will spend the next minute switching between a half empty sub-machine gun and a discarded USP.45
    Then, after spending the next minute getting your gun back, you die while reloading it.
    hahaha.  No shit. 
>Patiently flank the enemy team. Your team mates spawn beside you.

Every. fucking. time. &#3232;\_&#3232; 

    Every fucking time. I think I'm so sneaky. Then. FUCK
        And it's always that guy who likes to fire his unsilenced gun at the ground just for the hell of it.
        EVERY. FUCKING. TIME.

"Hay guise, mind if I spray and pray right next to you?"
    You're flanking the other team and you're teammates DIDN'T spawn right on your ass. Then just as you're about to get a triple kill...."Enemy UAV inbound." And you get ass raped by your to-be triple kill.
* You come around a corner and knife someone. You miss and they panic knife you.
* Out of ammo? The only thing you can find on the ground is a Stinger.

Forgot two of the most important ones:

* In the middle of your knife lunge at a still-standing enemy, a friendly will down him to Dead Man's Hand and treat you to a point-blank tactical nuke.
* When running Specialist, the moment you hit OMA someone will spawn behind you or the next enemy you come up against will have DMH active.
    Oh my god yes! On underground, I was using a UMP .45 Red dot, went to knife a guy, no big deal, teammate shoots him, he drops into DMH, still no biggie, I knife him while he's sitting on his ass, and we both blow up in some tactical nuke shit. Thanks IW.
    As you are retracting your knife blade out of some guy's heart, he shoots you four times and stabs you in the face, just to humiliate you.
Get killed, respawn, decide to check the leaderboard really quick. A dude shoots you in the face.

You see a tac insert, and kill a sniper on the way over to it. It was his tac insert, and he respawns and no-scopes you before you can smash it.

Call in a Predator Missile, and every-goddamn-body has Blind Eye equipped.
    Sure this might be a dick move, but I regard using tactical insertion as a dick move. I never camp because I love running and gunning too much and campers are bitches, but every time I see a tactical insertion, I can't help but camp on its location until the guy respawns just to kill him again. It's like the tactical insertion is saying "Here! Here's a free kill! Do you want it or not?"
        After 3 days of gameplay, I just did this for the first tome tonight. Killed a Guy and started to run away when a buddy of mine said "get back to that Tac" so I did and knifed the Guy. I knew knifing him would give me great satisfaction,  and it did
        Why is taking advantage of something the game made available to you a dick move? Excluding akimbo fmg's, everyone who uses those is a dick.
            I just put in that disclaimer before anyone could call me a dick for camping on a tactical insertion. It really *does* seem like someone just offering a free kill every time.
                Oh, no, don't get me wrong. If you manage to find my insertion, by all means, lay next to it for five minutes looking down your sight waiting for me to spawn. I'm even gonna one-up ya...even more satisfying than killing a "tactical inserter" is when (using the tac) you know the person is there waiting for you, spawn, swing around, and knife them in the face. Best. MW3. Feeling. Ever.
                    Haha, That's why I sit slightly far away, not prone, mostly behind something with ADS, while making sure I'm safe from enemies at the same time.
            Oh you have the FMG title that represents 2500 kills? You must be a star player.
        I don't have the patience to wait around for the respawn, and usually I'm too paranoid that someone will backstab me while I'm sitting there.
        I like to throw a betty or claymore on TI's. Don't have to wait, and it usually gets me a free kill.
            Interesting, I would think Stalker might negate that, but if they *just* spawned they still might not react quickly enough.
                It isn't guaranteed of course, but it works a good amount of the time. :)
> agaiOH FUCK HE'S GOT A STRIKER

Every damn time...
    This was my favorite point, made me laugh out loud. So fucking true.
>If I throw down a care package, somebody will steal it from me, regardless of where I've placed it or how attentively I am guarding it. Call of Duty will always find a way to take it from me. Unless its a UAV. Then I can keep it.

Or an IMS... It's ALWAYS an IMS

This post is fucking perfect BTW
>**That, or one of your team mates will try to escape the Predator Missile by sprinting towards you.**

Seriously holy crap. I don't care if I die from the Predator Missile but why do my teammates need to help make it a triple kill?
    I hate people who use mikes so I never use them but I just want to scream at them "STAY! THE FUCK! AWAY! FROM ME! I'M FUCKING INVISIBLE AND YOU'RE NOT YOU FUCKSTICK!" (I like to call my blind eye pro/assassin pro class "invisible" because sometimes it feels like I literally am, I've had enemies run from behind me, around me in search of.... my teammates I guess?)
        I hate "That's a Decoy. THATS A DECOY. DECOY!!!! **DON'T GET IT IT'S *beepbeepbeepbeep* BOOM**
            I've recently started trying to grab the decoys myself because I know how to escape its blast. So far, so good.
                How do you escape the blast? I've been able to do it by capturing it *just* barely around a corner so I have quick cover, but certainly not consistently. 
                    If you stand just at the edge of where you can capture the package, you will have enough time to run away and escape the blast.
    I got yelled at the another night by a Redditor for "being too close to him" when a Predator got called in. What he didn't realize is that I was running Blind Eye so he was the one they were honing in on.
        Maybe he meant it more like "Stay away from me, friend; save yourself!"
    AN EMEMY PREDATOR? HUDDLE UP TEAM!
Swear you're not going into the tunnel again.  Go in anyways.  Die to prone camper again.
You forgot, time is about to run out and you are winning by one kill on tdm one idiot will run out and die and you draw.
    >Two idiots will run and die and you lose.

FTFY
Flank camper that's been there since the birth of Christ, throw a throwing knife at him. Moves slightly causing the knife to miss, kills you.
Having an itch is better than having a UAV up. It's nearly a guarantee if you go to itch someone WILL pop up.
    And it's always on my nose.
        i have to scratch something then the wii's cursor will start flying all over the place and then an enemy shows up
            don't play on the wii. problem solved
                I can't, so this is out of the question
                    Yes you can. 
It's called buying an Xbox.
                        naw bro

>Four enemy players have their backs to me. Either I'll panic, miss and run out of bullets before I kill the second guy or I'll be blown up by an exploding car as I try to get closer.

No, no, no. You hit each person with two bullets, then they turn around and kill you.
    Don't forget that Final Stand fag..
        lmao
    true story.
•The enemy will block your knife with his arm and knife you back
Didn't read through all the comments but here is mine:

You WILL get added to the team with the 5 12year olds who will scream into the mic in their high pitched voices and spend the match trying to get their 360 no scope jump shots.
    Me and my friends call them "squeakers".
        the only once I hate more than the squeakers (yes I'm using that now), is the once that seem to want to DJ the lobby with their crappy music.
        and they talk the whole game....not about whats going on in the game..and they say the N word alot.
 
        im stealing that
    I thought I was the only one who got these types of teammates..
        Not at all.

To this day I can not get a handle on drop shotting but I can mute the entire lobby in 2 seconds.
        You are...Until I get put in the same lobby, then I get them.
Let me toss in on this:

 Your opponents striker gets you from a mile away with sniper accuracy. Your striker has about as much distance as a Windex bottle.

You run up to an opponent and knife him, the animation process plays out as if you killed him but he's still alive and kickin'...you right in the face.
    I think the windex bottle would do more damage. We should have that instead of flash. 

MY EYES!
While filling any progress bar, once you hit the 90% mark, you will be killed by cod knows what.
2 Away from MOAB?  Get knifed from a hundred yards.  
You attempt to be a stealthy player with silencer/assassin/dead silence. The teammates that constantly follow you will do nothing but spray LMGs. 
> Four enemy players have their backs to me. Either I'll panic, miss and run out of bullets before I kill the second guy or I'll be blown up by an exploding car as I try to get closer.

Or, first guy goes into final stand, and your bullets go straight through the second guy who promptly turns around and kills you. You never even shoot on the killcam. 

> Cooking a grenade? It'll bounce off the frame of the door and come right back at you.

Fortunately you don't die from the explosion 2mm away from you, but it was a waste of equipment and now you have to wait for your health to come back. 
The solution:  DON'T FUCKING MOVE
    that would just work in lockdown, standing on the pedestal with the display dummies.
        Ugh, fucking hate that room. I always get distracted by the dummies, but somehow everyone else sees me instantly.
Don't forget that your footsteps sound like a loud ass hippo while your opponents tiptoe around like mice.
- Entire enemy team is tactically camping one entryway (very well might I add) with suppressed SCARs or ACRs.  

- Entire enemy team has  predator missile, attack helicopter, and a reaper (and one fucker with an ac 130) set as killstreaks.  And one kid has an emp which he will call in right after you get any killstreak (not that you will) 

- the rest of your team is a shit quick scoping clan




Every fucking game 
You just opened up a game 11-0? That's cute, let's spawn you by that burning car... not good enough? How about next to this guy with his striker and akimbo FMGs? How about in the middle of the other team? Oh, you're 11-7 now? That's precious. 
Lets not forget, you throw a flash/stun, and you die.
    You flash someone else? it's a little blip

You get flashed? Pure white screen for 3 seconds
        Make that 7 seconds
            Make that 15 seconds
        I remember seeing a funny video on youtube of some guy playing COD and every time someone would flash him and his TV went pure white it would shut it off i guess because it drew too much power or something. I found it very funny.
[deleted]
    You're 3 away from a pavelow. You get a doublekill and neither of them dropped a gun. I'll let you guys fill in the rest
About to throw a frag grenade to clear out some enemies, hold it long enough so it'll explode right when it hits them...team mate gets in the way and it bounces off him and kills you.

Oh god this ones my favorite:
Always encounter someone and they don't even realize you until you start shooting and somehow they can do a FULL 180 TURN AND KILL YOU WITH 2 BULLETS. OH GOD WHY DOES THIS KEEP HAPPENING.
>or I'll be blown up by an exploding car as I try to get closer.

Story of my fucking life.

>If I throw down a care package, somebody will steal it from me

Everyone is a fucking vulture.

Don't forget where you get a really good killstreak, only for it to be EMP'd out of the sky 5 seconds after you put it up.

Spend a full minute on TDM flanking a group of campers on the enemy team. 3 seconds before you open fire on them from behind, they call a UAV.
[deleted]
    My favorite (sarcasm) is when it joins you to a game that is already "grey-screen" and showing the score. What the fuck was the point of that, mw3?
Running around on a good kill streak and notice you're one away from an ac-130 hell yeah, oh look a red dot I'm sure I'll be able to pick him off easil-NOPE GUY WITH ASSASSIN SITTING IN A CORNER KILLS YOU.

EVERY. GOD. DAMN. TIME.
You're ADS toward a chokepoint doorway you KNOW someone is going through. Maybe you see him on advanced UAV, maybe you just killed him and you know for sure he's coming for revenge. You have this motherfucker dead to rights. He has no idea what kind of carnage awaits him through that door. Your hair trigger has never been more ready. You may get accused of walling because it will be so devastating to this assclown but you don't care. You hear footsteps and the hair on the back of your neck stands up. This is it! Time to give this noob a cockmeat sandwich. He blows through the door and headshots you with a P90 from the hip before you even get a round off. 


:-(
Doing good in a free for all match?, fuck you were going to spawn the whole other teams behind you!
Out of ammo? Two guns on the ground right next to each other. One is an ACR, the other a Javelin. I always pick up the Javelin and then get killed thinking I picked up the ACR.
You call in a UAV, then get yelled at by other players because your team already had a UAV up.
    I read that they stacked and three gives you the UAV that shows where the enemy is heading (forgot the name atm). Hope I haven't been wasting UAVs this whole time...
        3 UAV's = advanced UAV. 2 UAV's = at least UAV insurance. What I mean is it's not just a matter of one guy looking up in the sky and shooting your radar offline. It's not a huge game changer but it makes a difference. Also I never found out or sure if UAV time stacks with two or more in the air but ive always felt like it does.
            2 UAVs give faster sweeps on the radar. 4 will give faster sweeps of the AUAV. And so on.
You walk around corner, and are confronted by a corridor. In the middle is a person, with a green name above their head. You immediately begin running forwards, sure that this area is safe for now. This person then shoots you, causing you to realise you had a teammate at the OTHER END of the corridor, and an enemy in the middle. 
This has been in every COD - why can't enemies block the green names or something -_-
    I can't believe how often that's happened to me. Either the enemy has Assassin enabled so his red name doesn't show up, or some logic within the programming decides that your teammate's name takes precedence in that screen space.
Plant bouncing betty as flashbang comes through window, or as someone runs up. 

When you see 2 people with your predator and they both get killed seconds before it hits.
Wii- when you shake the nunchuck to knife, the cursor goes wild and you cannot re-center it before you die.
Universal- you get hit by a flashbang, and as soon as your vision re sets and you can sprint again, you get shot.
    Upvote for playing on a Wii. I tried to play WaW on mine but couldn't get used to the controls
        theres also lag shooting on that, they fixed it in black ops
You... You magnificent bastard...
you teammate will step in front of you every time you shot at someone on HCTDM... Friendly fire will not be tolerated
You just get a UAV kill-streak. You walk around the corner while pulling out the phone to call it in a get shot while you have no weapon.
You're on a killstreak and just about manage to kill a guy with your last few bullets. You run to pick up his gun and it has miraculously gone in seconds. You then re-spawn to find a guy sitting in your spawn that has been there the whole game -.-
This is the most hilarious accidental circlejerk here hahah! 

Because we can all relate and agree 100%.

Good on you for this post.
You finally get your assault UAV only to learn the whole enemy team is running assassin
Your 1887 doesnt deal fatal damage even when fired close-up right in the face - get knifed - get sniped across half the map with your salvaged shotgun the next 3 rounds in a row ...
>You pick up a weapon that you don't normally use and beast with it. You equip it on one of your classes and you go 1-5 in the first minute.

I've never understood that one...but it's completely true. I'd really like to know why I can get a 15 kill streak with that ACOG FAD I picked up off the ground....but then I put it in one of my classes and I go 0-15.
    usually, when i'm forced to pick up another weapon i'm on a hot streak. Like all confident and just playing really well.  I think you just continue your hotstreak with it.  then you try with it later and you're not in the same mind set
    you know, that happens a lot to me, maybe it's some kind of glitch. im gonna go home try this all day today just to see if my character is better off with other peoples weapons
Legendary post, I felt like you authored it from spectating my whole MW3 existence. I didn't read all of the replies, but I'll add a few extra, hopefully not repeats:

* Begin Core solo match-making [quickly thrown into match in progress]. You will then be rewarded with a free loss following the 10 current Reaper/AC130 air strikes before you even get to choose a class. The score will probably be 190-23 in Domination.

* Match begins, you rush/sprint with no trouble across the map to flank the other team. When they spot you, you turn away to find cover, only to get stuck on a shoe-sized brick in the ground like a ROAD BLOCK as they proceed to shoot you in the back.

* Same situation as above, but when you flee a fire-fight and turn the corner (a solid brick/steel wall usually) you die anyway by heat-seeking bullets that turn a corner like a race car to find you.

* Get lobbied up with non-prestige players thinking it's gonna be a fun match, only to get mega-raped so bad your team quits and you're the only one left.

* Throw smoke to capture an objective, lay down in the midst of it totally incognito. Get shot instantly by the first person who approaches you (even with Assassin).

* Military trained soldiers/mercenaries. Can only sprint for 5 yards at a time.

* Multiple full fledge fire-fights with enemy team, grenade icons come down on your feet, your jump out of the way as it blows up... you then notice it was your team-mate's grenade the entire time, then you get shot and killed since you jumped out of cover.

* Enemy tosses flash grenade, YOU ARE BLINDED FOR LIFE. You toss flash grenade, is effective as a fire-fly.

* Kill confirmed: Mow down 5 enemies. Sprint like hell for their tags and get taken down by a random who spawned around the corner before you get any tags.

* Want to change your class between matches? Too bad, match begins, you're screwed instantly. Have nothing to do between matches? Lobby stays idle for 10 minutes.
    oh god the flash grenade one is so true. Usually when I get flashed my screen is white for like 40 seconds I swear.
    The flash grenade one... I know that feeling.
As a regular assassin user with silencer equipped, it enrages me when I'm on a team full of rushers and they all die then respawn right next to me.
You're out of ammo and you very smartly and patiently wait for the perfect opportunity to get a knife kill, he doesn't drop a weapon or has a stinger equipped 
    I'm legitimately curious about this, having been in that situation before, why do some enemies you kill not drop guns? Every player is carrying 2 guns, how could they POSSIBLY not drop 1 gun? And I'm not trying to exaggerate or be funny, some enemies just don't drop guns and I don't get why this occurs.
        I've never heard a good explanation for this one either. But it always seems to happen when you REALLY need a gun.
        I don't know man.  It drives me nuts 
This may be the single greatest thing I've ever read about MW3 or CoD. 
I has a sad.
Enemy has a helo up? No problem, I'll kill myself and switch to my anti air class. As soon as I respawn, a teammate shoots down the chopper.

Throw a C4 at a doorway; enemy comes running though, mash X to detonate C4, enemy is running blast shield, and I pick up the stinger that is always under my feet and am shot by the enemy.
You put that one tough killstreak on that you don't think you'll ever get.
You get a streak (get it?) of luck and pull it off.
Your AC-130 comes soaring over the battlefield, your beast mode fully engaged.
The lock-on detection is blaring immediately.
Shot down without firing a single shot.

Alt. ending: everyone is using stalker.

Substitute any tough killstreak to get and it happens to me everytime.
Great list. 

I can really relate to most of these. 
Spent five minutes trying to get behind the enemy's position? Don't bother, as soon as you get there, they're gonna spawn right behind you
In domination, if a point is being captured, it does not matter how fast you are or how perfectly you throw your grenade, you will always be too late.
Haha excellent! I actually thought many times that this game consists on murphy's laws on purpose. Checking your corners: Nobody there. Turn around to continue you path, get shot in the back.
Launch my predator towards a cluster of 3 enemies.

Two of them split up? Oh well at least I can get this last guy.

And then he gets sniper by one of your teammates.
My face will itch at the most inopportune time of the match. 
Dear god if this isnt the truth. ALSO: unnecessary reload. 
Playing HC, spot a group of enemies, toss a semtex. A Teammate will run right into your semtex. "Friendly fire will not be tolerated."

Every. Single. Time.

Extra points: you scream at your teammate to avoid the semtex. He will run into it anyway.
Your are 100% certain you are sneaking up on whole team, other team gets UAV, and you happen to be on your only class without assassin.
Cross post from another thread: http://imgur.com/vHPn3
> If an enemy player gets a Predator Missile, he will single you out. It doesn't matter if you're on your own. It doesn't matter if the rest of your team mates are huddled together on the other side of the map. The enemy player isn't interested in getting a triple kill or a multi kill. He's only interesting in getting you.

EVERY. FUCKING. TIME. ಠ_ಠ
They have: full metal jacket hollow point laser guided heat seeking cop killer bullets.  you have: air soft
A camper kills you, instantly causing rage. You make a bee-line across the map to get the little shit, only just as you prepare to semtex his ass, someone knifes you from behind.
Or, you carefully sneak across the map to his position, taking great care to ensure there is no one around to get you, throw a semtex at his position... only to find he just left it. While standing there in helpless rage, he will knife you from behind.
You're quickscoping. You've managed to flank the entire enemy team, and are preparing to down them all, when you run into one of them going around the outside. You shoot him, hitmarker. Shoot him again, final stand. Shoot him AGAIN, dead. Entire enemy team is lying on the ground facing you when you come around corner.
Wait at an enemy tac insert for 40seconds. Teammate runs past and denies it
A lot of these happen to me way to often, did you make these up by yourself? 
    No make believe required. Play call of duty for about 5 minutes and you'll experience it all.
Lately the only thing I've been getting from care packages are predator missiles, which  I am useless with and have no need to use since I have the titles and emblems. Just once I would like to get an AC-130 or strafe run without it being in a private match or having to steal it from someone (enemy or otherwise).
You get a UAV and instinctively call it in. An enemy Counter UAV was already up.
When you have plenty of ammo you'll accidentally pick up a type95 or ACR every time you try to reload. When you're out of ammo all you can find is USP 45s and Dragonuvs, if you're lucky. 


>You decide to swap your semtex for a claymore. Half-way through the next game, you see a group of enemies. You decide to throw a semtex grenade at them, only to take out a claymore and get killed while you're still clutching it in your hands.

This happened to me 4 times today after trying out HC FFA.
    i've managed to throw trophy systems at enemies at last 10 times in the last 3 matches. wouldn't remember that i had swapped out my flash bangs. needless to say that the 2-3 seconds it takes to put down a trophy system earns you 3-6 bullets to your butt. and you look like one for setting up a trophy system in the most useless location on the map and at the wrongest of times.
        Quickdraw pro helps with the deployment of trophy system to the point where it's pretty much impossible to use without that perk. 
        I almost did that a couple times. It's why I have trophies on all of my classes.
And another;

If you're on a high killstreak going for a MOAB the enemies you kill get Commando as a deathstreak. And it only affects you.
I think the turning around for one second and turning back to where you were originally looking to die is the most relevant. Besides everyone but you getting commando lunges. 
People mistake the game being bad for them being bad at the game most of the time. the times when things go well are not the times they remember.
* You give the *exact* location of a camper to your teammates. You respawn and try to approach said camper from a different angle, only to find all your teammates dead and the camper kills you. 
    * Repeat

Get thrown into a game, lose 5 seconds later
You forgot:
STRIKERMSRSTRIKERMSRSTRIKERSTRIKERMSRSTRIKERSTRIKERMSRSTRIKERSTRIKERMSR
Run the Assault/Specialist Package? Die before a UAV


Support Package? Get your EMP before you die once..

Happens to me all the time
You want to capture a flag before while your teammates are capturing it to add a point to your streak. Teammates capture flag as soon as you're there.
Make it a COD Muphry's law instead. ;D
In other words "whatever keeps me from getting what I want is somebody's fault but not mine. My life is so awful because I'm just so persecuted by a plastic disc with a hole in it"
now I have to play some saints row the third.
The penetrator!
    The **PURPLE** penetrator!
**PURPLE** the man said.  Be specific.
This may be the most upvoted comment in this entire subreddit.
Every. single.time. 
Actually, the kill cam shows his current blindness in real time, not how white his screen was when he killed you. It's the same problem that occurred in Black Ops, where you get killed through smoke or fire and the kill cam shows it perfectly clear.
    Are you sure? Because ive seen killcams completly white-screen
        Yes I'm sure.  In those cases, they may have still been flashed.  I know I've gotten a few kills while completely whitescreened before, it's more luck and guessing where they're coming from then any real skill though.
Always. I end up not killing any of them, because I get too excited and want to kill every single one of them.
    On the rare occasion I get smart and throw C4 at them. Of course the norm for me is not being able to decide which to kill first and carefully shooting in between all of them.
        I toss the C4 killing them... and myself.
            Oh yes, that happens more often that not too.
            I toss the c4 and they shoot it up in my face
Usually because aim assist starts playing tug of war and you can never stay on target long enough to finish them off, despite the 6 hit markers per enemy.
    Lol, aim assist. 
        i love you.
            I know you do baby.
        Lol, difference between quick movement of mouse and one click and sensitivity of two different analog stick to keep your aim perfect ... you're cool. 
Seconds before firing on your first victim team Predator Missile trolls in and kills them all...
    Or the opposite. You are about to get a triple or quad kill with a Predator Missle and a teammate/s kills them all.
YES YES YES.  That. 
Your about to start laying them out and you get instantly knifed from behind
    >Your about to start laying them out and you get instantly knifed from a spawn behind you
Or get excited and shoot in the exact centre of all of them... hitting none.
Or. See two enemys standing about 2 feet away from each other, both looking directly at you. You start shooting between them and they both kill you after you finish shooting your entire clip into the wall behind them.
When I first started playing and had bad games I brushed it off because I was having fun.

Now when these things happen to me I get frustrated. For example the MW3 on PC crashed twice on me today causing me to lose challenges, achievements, and XP.

You know you're playing too much when fun turns into frustration every single time.
Hell I am drunk now.
    dude!  read it again!
    same.
This needs to be up there.
>* You, and only you, will always be the only one that tries taking out air support. If you don't, the enemy team will have every conceivable combination of killstreak up at all times, for their full durations.

Addendum: The second your killstreak is announced you hear 6 Stinger missiles and a SAM turret firing and it is brought down before it knew it was alive.
About the enemy air support:
"If i pick up a class that doesnt have a Stinger, none of my teammates will take down a helicopter. The moment i swap my class for the one with a Stinger, the helicopter either goes, or another teammate finally decudes to take it down"
> You, and only you, will always be the only one that tries taking out air support. If you don't, the enemy team will have every conceivable combination of killstreak up at all times, for their full durations.

This one drive me crazy. I almost always have stinger equipped and take out everything. The second I actually try and have some fun with a different secondary, NO ONE on my team will take out a stinger. Drives me fucking crazy. 

Frequently this.

No telling how many times on ANY fPS.
You trust those random fucks behind you or in the same room to watch your ass and they decide to circle jerk the exact moment enemy comes knocking.
USE YOUR DAMN EYES.
HOW THE FUCK DID HE EVEN MAKE IT AROUND THE CORNER, LET ALONE IN THE GODDAMN ROOM WITH 3 OF YOU WATCHING THE SAME FUCKING DOOR?
HERE I AM KILLING EVERYTHING THAT COMES THROUGH 2 DOORS.
    FOR FUCKING REAL TEAM!?! WHAT ON GODS GREEN BEAUTIFUL EARTH WERE YOU THINKING? FUCKING EYES, USE EM, FUCKING TRIGGER FINGER, USE IT. GOD FUCKING DAMN CAN ONLY I KILL? 

Looks at score board, they only have two total kills combined, you have six.


        I have no shit been knifed in the back in a room full of teammates.

Only I have eyes and only I have names that appear red.
        I can't even count the number of times I've checked the leaderboard on search, thinking wtf is going on here, only to see that I've got twice as many kills as everyone else on my team combined.  The worst part being that I usually only have around six or seven.
Very well put, I can really appreciate this.
This his me more than any of the other obvious ones. 
Yes. 

**WHAT FOUL MAGIC IS THIS??**
And the most frustrating one: You ask a dude if you can give him sweet felatio, but he declines. 
    Yes. That is troublesome.

ಠ_ಠ
    I cracked up...but you still get downvotes.
    *fellatio
or when you do get an awesome kill streak reward from a care package there's 30 seconds left in the game. also can someone please tell me what the ims does?
    it gets destroyed and the enemy +1s their pointstreak
        Both of the above are accurate descriptions.

            Not true... Enemy IMS' will murder your teammates ruthlessly.
    It is a motion-based explosive. When an enemy runs by it, it shoots some sort of grenade at them. Unfortunately, Stalker Pro cancels it out and it is easy to destroy. 

A well-placed one, with a little luck, can be quite good for someone.
        I've gotten 3 or 4 kills at choke points with it. 
            place it above the pipes on hardhat during a domination match and watch the glory ;-)
                The camp spot above the pipe from c to b? 
                    Yes - most ppl get nuked leaving the pipe or rushing from B to C
        It effectively shoots a souped up bouncing betty into the air and kills everything in a 20-30 ft radius.
    kills the enemy, no matter where they go, no matter how low they drop, no matter how fast they run.
        Ah actually to survive the ims every time you must lay down with the center of your body in the middle of the ims and it won't kill you. Just start shooting or knifing and destroy it while it tries to kill you and you laugh because you just learned how to beat the IMS :D
            Or, Sitrep Pro + EMP :)
                But if you use my technique you can have dead silence :) I love emp nades though!
    It's a bouncing betty with longer range which can get off four shots. Sucks when you use it, but when the enemy does it is guaranteed to get constant double kills as everyone runs through the same door. 
Also, it will probably kill you once, you will then come back to the same place an age later, expecting someone will have destroyed it by now, only to be killed again.

And you will spend the next minute switching between a half empty sub-machine gun and a discarded USP.45
Then, after spending the next minute getting your gun back, you die while reloading it.
hahaha.  No shit. 
Every fucking time. I think I'm so sneaky. Then. FUCK
    And it's always that guy who likes to fire his unsilenced gun at the ground just for the hell of it.
    EVERY. FUCKING. TIME.

"Hay guise, mind if I spray and pray right next to you?"
You're flanking the other team and you're teammates DIDN'T spawn right on your ass. Then just as you're about to get a triple kill...."Enemy UAV inbound." And you get ass raped by your to-be triple kill.
Oh my god yes! On underground, I was using a UMP .45 Red dot, went to knife a guy, no big deal, teammate shoots him, he drops into DMH, still no biggie, I knife him while he's sitting on his ass, and we both blow up in some tactical nuke shit. Thanks IW.
As you are retracting your knife blade out of some guy's heart, he shoots you four times and stabs you in the face, just to humiliate you.
Sure this might be a dick move, but I regard using tactical insertion as a dick move. I never camp because I love running and gunning too much and campers are bitches, but every time I see a tactical insertion, I can't help but camp on its location until the guy respawns just to kill him again. It's like the tactical insertion is saying "Here! Here's a free kill! Do you want it or not?"
    After 3 days of gameplay, I just did this for the first tome tonight. Killed a Guy and started to run away when a buddy of mine said "get back to that Tac" so I did and knifed the Guy. I knew knifing him would give me great satisfaction,  and it did
    Why is taking advantage of something the game made available to you a dick move? Excluding akimbo fmg's, everyone who uses those is a dick.
        I just put in that disclaimer before anyone could call me a dick for camping on a tactical insertion. It really *does* seem like someone just offering a free kill every time.
            Oh, no, don't get me wrong. If you manage to find my insertion, by all means, lay next to it for five minutes looking down your sight waiting for me to spawn. I'm even gonna one-up ya...even more satisfying than killing a "tactical inserter" is when (using the tac) you know the person is there waiting for you, spawn, swing around, and knife them in the face. Best. MW3. Feeling. Ever.
                Haha, That's why I sit slightly far away, not prone, mostly behind something with ADS, while making sure I'm safe from enemies at the same time.
        Oh you have the FMG title that represents 2500 kills? You must be a star player.
    I don't have the patience to wait around for the respawn, and usually I'm too paranoid that someone will backstab me while I'm sitting there.
    I like to throw a betty or claymore on TI's. Don't have to wait, and it usually gets me a free kill.
        Interesting, I would think Stalker might negate that, but if they *just* spawned they still might not react quickly enough.
            It isn't guaranteed of course, but it works a good amount of the time. :)
This was my favorite point, made me laugh out loud. So fucking true.
I hate people who use mikes so I never use them but I just want to scream at them "STAY! THE FUCK! AWAY! FROM ME! I'M FUCKING INVISIBLE AND YOU'RE NOT YOU FUCKSTICK!" (I like to call my blind eye pro/assassin pro class "invisible" because sometimes it feels like I literally am, I've had enemies run from behind me, around me in search of.... my teammates I guess?)
    I hate "That's a Decoy. THATS A DECOY. DECOY!!!! **DON'T GET IT IT'S *beepbeepbeepbeep* BOOM**
        I've recently started trying to grab the decoys myself because I know how to escape its blast. So far, so good.
            How do you escape the blast? I've been able to do it by capturing it *just* barely around a corner so I have quick cover, but certainly not consistently. 
                If you stand just at the edge of where you can capture the package, you will have enough time to run away and escape the blast.
I got yelled at the another night by a Redditor for "being too close to him" when a Predator got called in. What he didn't realize is that I was running Blind Eye so he was the one they were honing in on.
    Maybe he meant it more like "Stay away from me, friend; save yourself!"
AN EMEMY PREDATOR? HUDDLE UP TEAM!
>Two idiots will run and die and you lose.

FTFY
And it's always on my nose.
    i have to scratch something then the wii's cursor will start flying all over the place and then an enemy shows up
        don't play on the wii. problem solved
            I can't, so this is out of the question
                Yes you can. 
It's called buying an Xbox.
                    naw bro

Don't forget that Final Stand fag..
    lmao
true story.
Me and my friends call them "squeakers".
    the only once I hate more than the squeakers (yes I'm using that now), is the once that seem to want to DJ the lobby with their crappy music.
    and they talk the whole game....not about whats going on in the game..and they say the N word alot.
 
    im stealing that
I thought I was the only one who got these types of teammates..
    Not at all.

To this day I can not get a handle on drop shotting but I can mute the entire lobby in 2 seconds.
    You are...Until I get put in the same lobby, then I get them.
I think the windex bottle would do more damage. We should have that instead of flash. 

MY EYES!
that would just work in lockdown, standing on the pedestal with the display dummies.
    Ugh, fucking hate that room. I always get distracted by the dummies, but somehow everyone else sees me instantly.
You flash someone else? it's a little blip

You get flashed? Pure white screen for 3 seconds
    Make that 7 seconds
        Make that 15 seconds
    I remember seeing a funny video on youtube of some guy playing COD and every time someone would flash him and his TV went pure white it would shut it off i guess because it drew too much power or something. I found it very funny.
You're 3 away from a pavelow. You get a doublekill and neither of them dropped a gun. I'll let you guys fill in the rest
My favorite (sarcasm) is when it joins you to a game that is already "grey-screen" and showing the score. What the fuck was the point of that, mw3?
I read that they stacked and three gives you the UAV that shows where the enemy is heading (forgot the name atm). Hope I haven't been wasting UAVs this whole time...
    3 UAV's = advanced UAV. 2 UAV's = at least UAV insurance. What I mean is it's not just a matter of one guy looking up in the sky and shooting your radar offline. It's not a huge game changer but it makes a difference. Also I never found out or sure if UAV time stacks with two or more in the air but ive always felt like it does.
        2 UAVs give faster sweeps on the radar. 4 will give faster sweeps of the AUAV. And so on.
I can't believe how often that's happened to me. Either the enemy has Assassin enabled so his red name doesn't show up, or some logic within the programming decides that your teammate's name takes precedence in that screen space.
Upvote for playing on a Wii. I tried to play WaW on mine but couldn't get used to the controls
    theres also lag shooting on that, they fixed it in black ops

    Ah actually to survive the ims every time you must lay down with the center of your body in the middle of the ims and it won't kill you. Just start shooting or knifing and destroy it while it tries to kill you and you laugh because you just learned how to beat the IMS :D
        Or, Sitrep Pro + EMP :)
            But if you use my technique you can have dead silence :) I love emp nades though!
It's a bouncing betty with longer range which can get off four shots. Sucks when you use it, but when the enemy does it is guaranteed to get constant double kills as everyone runs through the same door. 
Also, it will probably kill you once, you will then come back to the same place an age later, expecting someone will have destroyed it by now, only to be killed again.

And it's always that guy who likes to fire his unsilenced gun at the ground just for the hell of it.
EVERY. FUCKING. TIME.

"Hay guise, mind if I spray and pray right next to you?"
After 3 days of gameplay, I just did this for the first tome tonight. Killed a Guy and started to run away when a buddy of mine said "get back to that Tac" so I did and knifed the Guy. I knew knifing him would give me great satisfaction,  and it did
Why is taking advantage of something the game made available to you a dick move? Excluding akimbo fmg's, everyone who uses those is a dick.
    I just put in that disclaimer before anyone could call me a dick for camping on a tactical insertion. It really *does* seem like someone just offering a free kill every time.
        Oh, no, don't get me wrong. If you manage to find my insertion, by all means, lay next to it for five minutes looking down your sight waiting for me to spawn. I'm even gonna one-up ya...even more satisfying than killing a "tactical inserter" is when (using the tac) you know the person is there waiting for you, spawn, swing around, and knife them in the face. Best. MW3. Feeling. Ever.
            Haha, That's why I sit slightly far away, not prone, mostly behind something with ADS, while making sure I'm safe from enemies at the same time.
    Oh you have the FMG title that represents 2500 kills? You must be a star player.
I don't have the patience to wait around for the respawn, and usually I'm too paranoid that someone will backstab me while I'm sitting there.
I like to throw a betty or claymore on TI's. Don't have to wait, and it usually gets me a free kill.
    Interesting, I would think Stalker might negate that, but if they *just* spawned they still might not react quickly enough.
        It isn't guaranteed of course, but it works a good amount of the time. :)
I hate "That's a Decoy. THATS A DECOY. DECOY!!!! **DON'T GET IT IT'S *beepbeepbeepbeep* BOOM**
    I've recently started trying to grab the decoys myself because I know how to escape its blast. So far, so good.
        How do you escape the blast? I've been able to do it by capturing it *just* barely around a corner so I have quick cover, but certainly not consistently. 
            If you stand just at the edge of where you can capture the package, you will have enough time to run away and escape the blast.
Maybe he meant it more like "Stay away from me, friend; save yourself!"
i have to scratch something then the wii's cursor will start flying all over the place and then an enemy shows up
    don't play on the wii. problem solved
        I can't, so this is out of the question
            Yes you can. 
It's called buying an Xbox.
                naw bro

lmao
the only once I hate more than the squeakers (yes I'm using that now), is the once that seem to want to DJ the lobby with their crappy music.
and they talk the whole game....not about whats going on in the game..and they say the N word alot.
 
im stealing that
Not at all.

To this day I can not get a handle on drop shotting but I can mute the entire lobby in 2 seconds.
You are...Until I get put in the same lobby, then I get them.
Ugh, fucking hate that room. I always get distracted by the dummies, but somehow everyone else sees me instantly.
Make that 7 seconds
    Make that 15 seconds
I remember seeing a funny video on youtube of some guy playing COD and every time someone would flash him and his TV went pure white it would shut it off i guess because it drew too much power or something. I found it very funny.
3 UAV's = advanced UAV. 2 UAV's = at least UAV insurance. What I mean is it's not just a matter of one guy looking up in the sky and shooting your radar offline. It's not a huge game changer but it makes a difference. Also I never found out or sure if UAV time stacks with two or more in the air but ive always felt like it does.
    2 UAVs give faster sweeps on the radar. 4 will give faster sweeps of the AUAV. And so on.
theres also lag shooting on that, they fixed it in black ops
I've never heard a good explanation for this one either. But it always seems to happen when you REALLY need a gun.
I don't know man.  It drives me nuts 
Quickdraw pro helps with the deployment of trophy system to the point where it's pretty much impossible to use without that perk. 
I almost did that a couple times. It's why I have trophies on all of my classes.
Yes I'm sure.  In those cases, they may have still been flashed.  I know I've gotten a few kills while completely whitescreened before, it's more luck and guessing where they're coming from then any real skill though.
I toss the C4 killing them... and myself.
    Oh yes, that happens more often that not too.
    I toss the c4 and they shoot it up in my face
i love you.
    I know you do baby.
Lol, difference between quick movement of mouse and one click and sensitivity of two different analog stick to keep your aim perfect ... you're cool. 
I have no shit been knifed in the back in a room full of teammates.

Only I have eyes and only I have names that appear red.
I can't even count the number of times I've checked the leaderboard on search, thinking wtf is going on here, only to see that I've got twice as many kills as everyone else on my team combined.  The worst part being that I usually only have around six or seven.
Both of the above are accurate descriptions.

    Not true... Enemy IMS' will murder your teammates ruthlessly.
I've gotten 3 or 4 kills at choke points with it. 
    place it above the pipes on hardhat during a domination match and watch the glory ;-)
        The camp spot above the pipe from c to b? 
            Yes - most ppl get nuked leaving the pipe or rushing from B to C
