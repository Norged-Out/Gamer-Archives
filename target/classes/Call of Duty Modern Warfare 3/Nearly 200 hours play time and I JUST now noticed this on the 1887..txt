[[Nearly 200 hours play time and I JUST now noticed this on the 1887.]]





Dat killfeed.
    Haha. It's for a video I'm working on. I uploaded just the clip quick. There is no sound as I'm doing all that by hand after I finish the video. I failed to notice the guy with the FMGs while playing. Got a good laugh out of it later on.

        I like how you just ran away from the enemy to the right with the akimbo FMG9's.
            Yeah. Between him just ducking there and the jelly eyes I only saw him when I was recording.
                love the grape jelly blindness.

                    It's an old clip but as I recall it was one of those two I ran into after.  Where the clip stops there is when I stopped fraps. 
        That was so fuckin sexy
        That was sexy, but it would've been so awesome if you got that last guy just chilling there with the akimbos. 
        Hey you're one of my friend's cousins! He told me about you like a few months back. Small world haha
            Ha, Small world indeed.
        How the hell did you get that 4th guy? It looks like you were aiming nowhere near him, maybe a few pellets landing.

Here are the frames [just before](http://i.imgur.com/MXJS3.jpg) and [after](http://i.imgur.com/X70RA.jpg) your shot. I'm not hating, just curious.
            It's recorded from the theater mode. It basically shows just how bad the game lags and how much it makes up for it. 
                So when you were playing he was closer to your crosshair?

Does the theater mode show a more neutral "where everyone's own screen showed they were" kind of version of the action?
MW2 akimbo 1887s and Black Ops during the Vorkuta escape on the motorcycle had you re-cocking the weapons just like the sewer chase in Terminator 2.
YOU IN THE WRONG HOOD MOTHERFUCKER.

QUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD
Nice quad btw!
I hate that map.
Sorry, too busy kicking ass to read the writing on the Model's hammer
woah....
I knew about it from the wiki before I even had the game, I just had no idea where it was, thanks!
Quaf
Model 1887 for life
someone posted a picture of the 1887 before the game was released and i saw this. (hipster moment)
Wow, I never noticed it either! Nice kill feed!
TIL that people do post new things on r/MW3. But seriously thats aweome and nice feedâ€¦ O_O
450+ hours playtime and I didn't notice this
T2 is my favorite movie, fuck yeah
I just found out last week that the trophy system has the [Words](http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120205134542/callofduty/images/thumb/e/e9/MW3_Trophy_System_POV.png/185px-MW3_Trophy_System_POV.png) " The Flyswatter" engraved on the side... 
Woah, nice find
If you weren't on PC I'd claim you stole this from me ;)

How the fuck is First Blood up yet you've already pulled a UAV?!
    Oops, nevermind. Boss though.
        That was a close one...

            Hahaha te onslaught was about to come.
MW3 is happening in 2016, but they still use a shotgun from 1887?
    When John Browning invents something, it doesn't matter what year it is.
        Well, I always thought the Model was a Remington. I'll be.
Yeh the texture resolution of CoD games is fairly good in my opinion. Like I just noticed in MW2, you could read the markings quite clearly on the sight railings on top of the AK-47, on the 360 even.
Mind blown
know it has been said before but you really are "BLIND" rob. Lmao
great find. 
You're name IS BlindRob so...
also that one douchemonger with the fmgs
I knew about that before MW3 was even announced.
