'''''Honkai: Star Rail''''' ({{zh|s=崩坏:星穹铁道|p=Bēnghuài: Xīngqióng Tiědào|l=Honkai: Star Dome Railway}}) is a [[role-playing video game|role-playing]] [[Gacha game|''gacha'' video game]] developed by [[miHoYo]], published by miHoYo in [[mainland China]] and worldwide by Cognosphere, [[d/b/a]] HoYoverse. It is miHoYo's first turn-based game, features the main character, referred to as the "Trailblazer", traveling across worlds through the Astral Express to resolving disasters caused by the "Stellaron". The first closed beta test was launched on October 27, 2021. It was publicly released internationally on April 26, 2023, for [[Windows]] and mobile devices; with the [[PlayStation 5]] port released on October 11, 2023. The [[PlayStation 4]] version is still yet to be announced, as revealed at the latest Summer Game Fest with a trailer. It is the fourth installment in the ''[[Honkai]]'' series, utilising characters from ''[[Honkai Impact 3rd]]'' and gameplay elements from ''[[Genshin Impact]].''
Partially due to the popularity of miHoYo's previous game, ''Honkai Impact 3rd'', the game received widespread expectations before its launch. It was nominated for the Most Wanted Game Award at the [[Golden Joystick Awards]] in 2022, won the Best Popularity Award of [[81st World Science Fiction Convention|World Science Fiction Game Annual Awards]] in 2023, and Best Mobile Game Award in the Game Awards 2023.
==Gameplay==
[[File:Honkai Star Rail Gameplay Battle.png|thumb|left|300px|A battle in ''Honkai: Star Rail'', as character ''Acheron'', showcasing its turn-based combat system]]
''Honkai: Star Rail'' follows the gameplay style of classic [[Japanese role-playing games]] : players build up a lineup of characters and control a team of up to four in [[Turn-based tactics|turn-based combat.]] In addition to various [[Statistic (role-playing games)|stats]] that affect characters' strength, each character has an elemental Type that affects the kind of damage dealt to targets, a [[character class]] referred to as a Path (see [[#Setting|Story and Setting § Setting]]) that defines their combat role, and a set of unique abilities called Traces used in combat. Each character can equip a weapon known as a Light Cone, that has various effects that activate if the Paths of both the character and Light Cone match. Characters can also equip various Relics, similar to Artifacts in ''[[Genshin Impact]]''.
Elements of open-world and dungeon exploration are present, with multiple mechanics, including the ''gacha'' system, carried over (with slight differences) from miHoYo's previous action RPG ''[[Genshin Impact]]''. Both games are [[Gacha game|''gacha'' games]], in which players spend in-game currency that can be earned in-game or purchased with real money to receive new characters and weapons.
==Story and setting==
=== Setting ===
The game is set in a [[science fantasy|science-fantasy]] universe in which humanity and sentient non-human beings follow the Paths of deity-like beings known as [[Aeon (Gnosticism)|Aeons]]. Those who follow Paths are known as Pathstriders. The Paths are based on an ideal. For example, the Abundance is based on the view that immortality is a blessing and that healing and altruism should be valued as a top priority. The Destruction believes that civilization is cancerous to the universe, and seeks to eradicate all of civilization through the spreading of various disasters, such as the Stellaron, also known as the Cancer of All Worlds, which brings destruction to any planet it is placed on.
Some Paths were led by deceased Aeons, but the Paths continue to exist without the influence of the Aeons. The main characters in the game follow the Path of Trailblaze, a Path created by the deceased Akivili. The Path of Trailblaze seeks to "explore, establish, and connect" among different worlds.
Some Paths are seen as antagonistic, protagonistic, or neutral. The primary antagonist of the game is Nanook, who controls the Path of Destruction, along with the Emanators of the Path of Destruction. Other Paths, such as the Path of Abundance, are not necessarily seen as antagonistic, but are at rival with The Hunt and other Paths, who view the immortality granted by the Path of Abundance as a curse.
Aside from the Path of Destruction, the Stellaron Hunters are a somewhat antagonistic [[antihero]] group throughout the game, who search for and collect Stellarons across the universe and claim to be able to see the future. The main characters are often in conflict with the Stellaron Hunters.

| AltDate = April 26, 2023
| ShortSummary = The Herta Space Station is seen being attacked by intergalactic monsters from the Antimatter Legion, followers of the Path of Destruction. Amidst the chaos, two Stellaron Hunters, Kafka and Silver Wolf, infiltrate the station and steal the Stellaron that was being safely held within it. Kafka takes hold of the Stellaron and inserts it into the body of an empty vessel generated by Silver Wolf (whose gender and name are chosen by the player). The vessel (known as the Trailblazer in English and various other names in other translations of the game) awakens, after which Kafka erases their memory, informs them of the future that lies ahead, and leaves. They then fall unconscious.
A now-amnesic Trailblazer wakes up and meets March 7th and Dan Heng. Both are traveling on the Astral Express, a large cosmic train that travels the universe along the eponymous "Star Rail". After eliminating the remaining threats from the Antimatter Legion, the Trailblazer meets Himeko, the Navigator of the Astral Express, and Welt J. Yang, an interstellar traveler originating from the world of ''[[Honkai Impact 3rd]]''. In an attempt to discover their origins and eliminate the threats of the remaining Stellarons, the Trailblazer departs with the Astral Express crew.}}

The Trailblazer, March, and Dan Heng arrive at Jarilo-VI, a planet that has been mostly ravaged by the Eternal Freeze, an uninhabitable winter caused by the power of a Stellaron, and the Fragmentum, a phenomenon that creates powerful monsters that work to injure or kill humans and destroy human-made creations. As the crew nears the capital city of Belobog to resolve the Stellaron affair, they are declared fugitives by Supreme Guardian Cocolia, after the Stellaron tells her to accuse them of attempting to overthrow Belobog's government. They escape the Belobog police and move to the Underworld below the planet, where they learn of the peacekeeping Wildfire and their ongoing conflict with Svarog, the leader of the robots, who has repeatedly rejected peace talks. After battling Svarog and learning new intelligence about the Stellaron, the crew returns to the surface to face Cocolia, who merges herself with the Stellaron and attempts to kill the Astral Express crew. The crew defeats her, and Bronya, Cocolia’s adopted daughter, takes her place as the new Supreme Guardian while announcing plans to bridge the Underworld and Belobog together.

The crew receives a signal from Kafka, who wants the crew to settle a Stellaron incident on the Xianzhou Luofu ({{zh|s=仙舟:罗浮|p=Xiānzhōu: Luófú|l=Immortal Boat: Luofu}}), a planet following the Path of The Hunt. When Welt, the Trailblazer, and March 7th arrive, they are not permitted to assist in Stellaron affairs but are instead tasked by Jing Yuan, a leader of the Xianzhou Luofu army, to weed out Kafka and her Stellaron Hunter cohort Blade, as the presence of the Stellaron Hunters on the ship is deemed a threat. The crew finds and defeats Kafka in battle, after which she reveals she was sent to lure the Astral Express crew to the Luofu to fulfill the prophecy laid out by the Stellaron Hunters' leader, Elio.
After Blade and Kafka are found and interrogated, the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus, a faction following the Path of Abundance, a rival Path to The Hunt, attack the Luofu in a conflict manipulated by Lord Ravager Phantylia, a leader of the Antimatter Legion. During this conflict, Dan Heng reveals that he is the reincarnation of a powerful exiled Vidyadhara criminal named Dan Feng during a battle with Blade, and assists the rest of the Astral Express and the Xianzhou Luofu army in fighting the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus and Lord Ravager Phantylia, resulting in the temporary retreat of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus and Antimatter Legion. After the battle, Jing Yuan formally creates an alliance between the Xianzhou and Astral Express and annuls the exile of Dan Heng's previous incarnation, granting him freedom onboard the Xianzhou Luofu.
After the Trailblazer and March return to the Express, Himeko tells the Trailblazer that their next stop is Penacony, the Planet of Festivities. Formerly a prison planet used by the Interastral Peace Corporation (IPC) to exile criminals, it had fallen under the control of Xipe, the Aeon of Harmony, some time ago, radically transforming the planet into a luxurious dream-like utopia. Himeko explains that the Family at Penacony issued formal invitations to many galactic factions for the first time in history and among the invited factions were the IPC and the Astral Express.
Meanwhile, Luocha, a traveling merchant visiting the Xianzhou Luofu, and Jingliu, a powerful swordmaster, meet Jing Yuan at the Shackling Prison, proclaiming that they will put the Abundance in their grave.

Topaz then tells the workers to stop the invasion. Bronya then considers accepting a proposal from Topaz to allow the IPC to take over Belobog but changes her mind once Himeko comes down from the Astral Express to inform Bronya that the IPC has been unsuccessful in managing the planets that accept the proposal approximately 20% of the time. The Trailblazer and March 7th start to fight with Topaz but stop after an intervention from Bronya. After being shown the progress of Belobog's citizens in reconstructing their planet, Topaz decides to leave the planet for the time being and receives a demotion from the IPC for failing to do her job.

After the events of Jolted Awake From a Winter Dream, the Trailblazer receives a message from a streamer named Guinaifen and heads back to the Xianzhou Luofu to meet up with her. Upon arrival, Guinaifen informs the Trailblazer about encountering "ghosts" with a Cloud Knight named Sushang on the Xianzhou Luofu. The pair head over to Fyxestroll Garden, where they meet Hanya, Xueyi, and Huohuo, members of the Ten-Lords Commission.
They inform the duo that what Guinaifen and Sushang saw are heliobi, ancient ghost-like enemies of the Xianzhou Alliance, and warn the duo that staying in the garden is dangerous. Huohuo begins to escort Guinaifen and the Trailblazer from the Fyxestroll Garden, but Guinaifen suddenly disappears without a trace. The Trailblazer searches for Guinaifen but ends up getting trapped in a mirror, where they meet Cirrus, one of the many heliobi. They help the Trailblazer out of the illusion, only to be met with a new heliobus, Furynox. However, defeating Furynox allows Cirrus to absorb the remaining heliobi, and uses this to attempt to defeat the group and take control of Fyxestroll Garden. The Trailblazer and their companions band together to fight Cirrus and force him to retreat.
Guinaifen, Sushang, Huohuo, and the Trailblazer then gather the heliobi who escaped from Fyxestroll Garden and return them to the garden. While doing this, they learn that Huohuo had frantically wandered off to search for her heliobus friend, Tail, and had become possessed by an unrelated heliobus. When the crew rescues Huohuo and returns to Fyxestroll Garden, they learn that Cirrus had taken advantage of them being gone to repeat his previous plan, but is defeated again by both the crew and Jing Yuan.

| ShortSummary = The Astral Express arrives on Penacony, the planet of festivities, to attend the Charmony Festival, which is overseen by the Family, primarily its representative Sunday, and his sister Robin, a renowned singer. Penacony's most significant luxury is a system of collective dreams known as the Dreamscape. While on Penacony, the Trailblazer meets people from various factions: Aventurine, an IPC Strategic Investment Department senior manager who has been sent to reclaim the planet for the company; Black Swan, a Memokeeper who leads the Garden of Recollection; Acheron, the self-proclaimed Galaxy Ranger who has killed the Annihilation Gang's leader, Duke Inferno, and stolen their invite; Stellaron Hunter Sam, an Iron Cavalry Knight who later clashes with the Trailblazer; and Firefly, a stowaway who suffers from a terminal illness and forms a close connection with the Trailblazer.
In the lead-up to the festival, Himeko informs the group of a distress signal from Penacony used by the Nameless. Masked Fool's master of disguise, Sparkle, who reveals that the siblings are papering over the Dreamscape's monstrous reality and sends the Trailblazer and Firefly into the "real" Dreamscape, the Memory Zone. While the Trailblazer is saved by the appearance of Black Swan and Acheron, Firefly is "killed" by a monster. Determined to avenge her, the Trailblazer reluctantly agrees to work with Aventurine, who reveals that Robin was "murdered" by "Death" and suggests that Acheron may be responsible, as dying within the Dreamscape should not be reflected in reality. However, Welt has a heart-to-heart with Acheron and confirms that she was not responsible for Robin's "death".
Aventurine is caught having swapped his Stoneheart - an IPC-granted source of power - with Topaz's when brought before Sunday. In retaliation, Sunday forces the power of Harmony into him, forcing him to speak the truth during his interrogation, and at the end, reveals that Aventurine has only 17 system hours left to live. Now on the verge of "death", Aventurine is plagued by visions of his past and future. These visions remind him that he had planned to get caught to lure Acheron and the Trailblazer into the same place; that the Stoneheart Sunday believed to be his actually belongs to his superior, Jade; and that Aventurine had destroyed his own Stoneheart before arriving on Penacony. Aventurine threatens to detonate the Stellaron within the Trailblazer, provoking Acheron, an Emanator of Nihility, to "kill" him, thus proving that one can be permanently killed in the Dreamscape and allowing the IPC to take action. Sam saves the Trailblazer from the aftermath and reveals themself to be a surviving Firefly in disguise. Sunday is confronted by Penacony's Head of Security Gallagher, who confirms his affiliation with the Enigmata and "Death", admits to being a culprit behind Robin's "death", and "kills" Sunday.

{{Quote box
| quote = ...we felt that the turn-based combat system was something we have not done before in the company yet, in all our previous games. It's still a viable genre to base the game on, and we felt that it's something that we would really like to give it a try, our players are really feeling for it, and that's why we developed something like that.
And for sci-fi, in reality, our developers felt that it's something that provides hope, and it's very inspiring for younger generations to really look forward to. Sci-fi represents something classic, and sci-fi plus turn-based RPG is something that we would like to give a try. Yeah, that's how the game came to be.

''Honkai: Star Rail'' began development in 2019 with the goal of "exploring new directions for the ''[[Honkai]]'' series". The production team has about 500 people, most of whom are fans of science fiction works and turn-based role-playing games. This project is HoYoverse’s first attempt at a turn-based combat mechanism game. The team has stated that this genre is very popular in the game market and can lower the difficulty threshold for players to get started. In previous surveys conducted by HoYoverse, many players expressed that they enjoy this type of game. There were concerns about whether this type of game is too retro, but the production team believes that as long as the quality of the game is enjoyable, it can attract players.
Like other works in the ''Honkai'' series, it is in no way "too hard-core science fiction". The setting of the previous game ''[[Honkai Impact 3rd]]'' is Earth, but the plot mentioned that there were other planets in this worldview. Therefore, the production team of ''Honkai: Star Rail'' decided to expand on this concept of "a universe". The basic setting revolves around taking a train and traveling around the major planets in the universe. The production of each planet in the game takes around one year. The production sequence is to first determine the worldview and theme of the planet, then create the characters and detailed setting information, and then finally write the plot. The design of the planet "Xianzhou Luofu" is based on East Asian fantasy, and has been described as "[[silkpunk]]".
In terms of combat mechanism, producer David Jiang said that this game adopts "command-based combat." He said that HoYoverse's previous titles ''Honkai Impact 3rd'' and ''[[Genshin Impact]]'' were heavy on the role-playing aspect, but they did not include command-based and turn-based combat. In addition, some players reported that ''Honkai Impact 3rd'' was too action-oriented and too difficult to operate. Therefore, ''Honkai: Star Rail'' pays more attention to strategy than the player's operational skills. ''[[Persona 5]]'' was the team's inspiration when deciding to develop a turn-based role-playing game.
Producer David Jiang hopes that ''Honkai: Star Rail'' can achieve the immersive feeling of "as if you are in the world of the work", and create a "playable animated series". In order to enhance player immersion, the production team integrated [[artificial intelligence]] technology into the behavior patterns of [[Non-player character|non-player characters]].

In the international market, [[miHoYo]] launched more than 2,000 sets of ads on Google Play one month before the public beta of the game. The main advertising channel was Google [[AdMob]] and the main advertising areas were Japan, Hong Kong, the United States, Vietnam, and Thailand.
On April 25, miHoYo released the game's opening theme animation "Star Travel". The game was officially launched globally on April 26. From April 29 to May 13, [[miHoYo]] undertook train advertisements on Xiamen Rail Transit Line 1 and jointly issued [[Non-fungible token|NFT]]s to promote the game. On mid-May, HoYoVerse began to put up ads for the game in Japan, which are prominently displayed in [[Akihabara]] in Tokyo, as well as collaborating with [[Chichibu Railway]] in [[Saitama Prefecture]] to launch a special steam train service, which ran for a month. On July 13, miHoYo launched a high-speed train named "Star Dome Railway High-speed Railway Brand Special Train" with an uncertain route, used to promote the game.

''Honkai: Star Rail'' received "generally favorable reviews" according to review aggregator [[Metacritic]].
''[[Eurogamer]]'' recommended the game for its "delightfully goofy humour, charismatic voice cast, and truly magnificent combat", despite the writers' tendency to "give one sentence explanations for important details, yet spend eight paragraphs overexplaining the simplest plot twist". ''[[Rock Paper Shotgun]]'' called the game "still in its early stages but (...) incredibly good fun to play", comparing it to "''[[Star Ocean]]'', but if everyone was hotter and you could gamble". The reviewer praised the combat system for being deep yet approachable, and noted that, like in [[Genshin Impact|''Genshin'']], spending money was not necessary to progress, as all content in the game could be cleared with the characters players receive for free. ''[[PC Gamer]]'' appreciated ''Star Rail''{{'}}s "impeccable visual style and strategic depth" and its "elastic tone, which fluctuates from the heroic optimism of a [[space opera]], to the dark comedy of a ''[[Nier]]'' game, with a lot of ''[[Final Fantasy XIV|Final Fantasy 14]]''{{'}}s soap opera storytelling mixed in". To the reviewer, the game's main draw was its "sheer creativity" and that it "distills what's most satisfying about turn-based RPGs: tactical, team-based decisions."
However, some people have criticized the character designs, saying that they lack creativity, especially those of female characters, saying the outfits worn by female characters in ''[[Genshin Impact]]'' had more variety.
=== Popularity ===
On the eve of the game's launch, the number of pre-registered players in mainland China reached 22.98 million, and 10 million outside of mainland China. On the day of pre-download on April 23, 2023, the game topped the [[App Store (Apple)|App Store's]] Top Free Apps list in more than 113 countries and regions, and ranked first in the overall list in mainland China, the United States, Japan, and South Korea.
