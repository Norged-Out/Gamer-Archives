'''''Shadowverse''''' is a [[digital collectible card game]] developed and published by [[Cygames]]. It was released [[free-to-play]] for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices in June 2016. [[macOS]] and [[Windows]] versions were released in October 2016.
''Shadowverse'' employs an [[anime]] art style with some illustrations reused from the developer's previous title, ''[[Rage of Bahamut]]'', an earlier digital collectible card game released in 2012. The game has been compared favorably with ''[[Hearthstone]]'' (2014), a difference being that Cygames sought to minimize the impact of randomness on match outcomes. Another difference is ''Shadowverse''{{'}}s "Evolve" [[game mechanic]] which allows players to grant played cards bonus stats and effects at the cost of an evolution point.
An [[anime]] television series adaptation by [[Zexcs]] aired from April 2020 to March 2021. A second anime series titled ''Shadowverse Flame'' has been announced. An RPG card game based on the anime, '''''Shadowverse: Champion's Battle''''' was released on the [[Nintendo Switch]] in Japan in November 2020. The game was released overseas on August 10, 2021.
==Gameplay==
''Shadowverse'' matches are structured between two players taking turns playing cards from their deck. Each player is represented by a Leader with 20 defense and a starting hand of three cards. The player going first has two evolution points, and the player going second has three evolution points, can evolve one turn earlier, and draws an extra card at the player's first turn. The objective of the player is to reduce the other player's defense to zero or attain a win via certain cards (e.g. ''Enstatued Seraph'' or a ''Victory Card'' by playing ''Spartacus''). Each player utilizes the ''Play Point'' resource to play cards. Both players begin at having zero play point orbs, and gain one play point orb at the beginning of the respective player's turn, up to a limit of 10. Play Point orbs are refilled at the beginning of each player's turn.
==Development==
New sets are added to ''Shadowverse'' at a regular interval of three months. The game launched with an initial set of ''Basic'' cards that were automatically added to new accounts or earned through the story mode, and the ''Standard'' set (now called ''Classic'') obtained from card packs. Additionally, a number of promotional cards have been released, which were obtainable through varying methods. These cards are cosmetic replacements for existing cards; they do not have a unique gameplay function. Once every three months, one card set will be out of rotation due to the arrival of a new card set.
Starting from the ''Dawnbreak, Nightedge'' expansion, Cygames has been releasing additional mini-expansions in between each normal expansion release; these mini-expansions contain a new gold card for all eight classes and a new legendary card for all classes with the exception of Neutral. Once a mini-expansion releases, the cards from that mini-expansion are available to open in the packs of the most recent set that came before them. Just like any other cards from the regular expansions, the mini-expansion cards can also be crafted with vials.
==Anime==
