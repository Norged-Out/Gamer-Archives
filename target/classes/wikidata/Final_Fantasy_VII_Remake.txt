{{Nihongo foot|'''''Final Fantasy VII Remake'''''|ファイナルファンタジーVII リメイク|Fainaru Fantajī VII Rimeiku|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is an [[action role-playing game]] by [[Square Enix]], released for [[PlayStation 4]] in April 2020. It is the first in a planned trilogy of games [[Video game remake|remaking]] the 1997 [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] game ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]''. An enhanced version, {{nihongo foot|'''''Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade''''',|ファイナルファンタジーVII リメイク インターグレード|Fainaru Fantajī VII Rimeiku Intāgurēdo|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} was released for [[PlayStation 5]] and [[Windows]] in 2021.
Set in the [[dystopian]] [[cyberpunk]] metropolis of [[Midgar]], players control the mercenary [[Cloud Strife]]. He joins [[AVALANCHE]], an [[eco-terrorist]] group trying to stop the powerful [[megacorporation]] Shinra from using the planet's life essence as an energy source. The gameplay combines [[Real-time game|real-time]] [[Action game|action]] with role-playing elements.
''Final Fantasy VII Remake'' was announced in 2015 following years of speculation. Several key staff members from the original game returned, including [[Tetsuya Nomura]] as the director, [[Yoshinori Kitase]] as the producer, [[Kazushige Nojima]] as the writer, [[Motomu Toriyama]] as a co-director, and the composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. The staff redesigned the characters to balance realism and stylization.
''Final Fantasy VII Remake'' received positive reviews, with praise for its graphics, gameplay, narrative, and music. Critics praised the expanded story and the updated battle system for its strategic elements and visual flourishes, but the linearity and repetitive side-quests received criticism. The game was one of the fastest-selling PlayStation 4 games, selling more than 3.5 million copies in three days and more than 7 million by September 2023. The second game in the remake trilogy, ''[[Final Fantasy VII Rebirth]]'', was released in 2024.
==Gameplay==
[[File:Final Fantasy VII Remake gameplay screenshot.png|thumb|left|While role-playing elements are still present in the gameplay similar to the original game, ''Remake'' uses a fast-paced real-time combat, as seen in this fight against two soldiers.]]
''Final Fantasy VII Remake'' is the first in a planned series of games [[Video game remake|remaking]] the 1997 [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] game ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]''. It covers the first section of the original game, set in the metropolis Midgar.
Players control [[Cloud Strife]], a former Shinra soldier turned mercenary who joins the [[eco-terrorist]] group AVALANCHE to fight the Shinra Corporation, who have been draining the planet's life energy. Every element has been remade, using real-time polygonal graphics as opposed to the [[Pre-rendering|pre-rendered]] environments of the original.
Exploration and battle mechanics both take place in real-time, like ''[[Final Fantasy XV]]''. The game features an altered [[Active Time Battle]] (ATB) system from the original, which gradually fills up slowly, or can fill faster with attacks. Once it is filled, the player can halt the action and use special abilities such as magic, items, and special moves. The player can assign these special abilities to shortcut buttons, allowing them to play in real-time without pausing. Each special ability uses up a segment of the ATB bar. The player can switch between party members at any time during battle. Each party member has their own individual skills, such as Cloud's close-quarters melee attacks and Barret's long-range distance attacks. Players are able to use magic and summons of large creatures, and a Limit Break gauge allows characters to perform more powerful attacks once charged. While the game has more real-time elements, strategic elements still remain, such as selecting weapons and magic for each character to wield.

{{Final Fantasy VII chronology}}
[[Cloud Strife]] ([[Cody Christian]]/[[Takahiro Sakurai]]){{efn|[[Major Dodson]] and Yukihiro Aizawa voiced Cloud at 14 years old in English and Japanese, respectively.}} is a former member of SOLDIER, the elite warriors of the Shinra Electric Power Company. Shinra uses Mako, a refined form of the Planet's spiritual energy harvested by massive reactors, to power the metropolis of Midgar and develop cutting-edge technology. Disillusioned with Shinra, and at the request of his childhood friend [[Tifa Lockhart]] ([[Britt Baron]]/[[Ayumi Ito]]){{efn|Glory Curda and Ayaka Mitsumoto voiced Tifa at 8 through 13 years old in English and Japanese, respectively.}}, Cloud takes a mercenary job for Avalanche, an eco-terrorist organization, led by [[Barret Wallace]] (John Eric Bentley/[[Masahiro Kobayashi (actor)|Masahiro Kobayashi]]). Barret believes excessive Mako harvesting harms the planet and leads a bombing attack on a Mako reactor. In the aftermath, Cloud is haunted by memories of [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]] ([[Tyler Hoechlin]]/[[Toshiyuki Morikawa]]), an enigmatic former SOLDIER member, and meets the florist [[Aerith Gainsborough]] ([[Briana White]]/[[Maaya Sakamoto]]){{efn|Capri Oliver and Chihiro Tanaka voiced Aerith at 7 years old in English and Japanese, respectively.}}. Strange ghost-like entities, who alternately help and hinder Cloud throughout the game, cause him to be recruited for another attack, in which he goes missing in action. Cloud meets Aerith again and protects her from Shinra forces. After they reunite with Tifa, the trio learns that Shinra plans to collapse a piece of the "plate" onto the Sector 7 slums. Avalanche fails to stop Shinra's plan, and the plate falls. Aerith helps most of the population, and Barret's daughter [[Marlene Wallace|Marlene]] evacuate in time but is captured by Shinra.
Cloud, Tifa, and Barret infiltrate Shinra headquarters and rescue Aerith from being used as an experiment by Shinra scientist [[Professor Hojo|Hojo]] ([[James Sie]]/[[Shigeru Chiba]]). She reveals that she is the last descendant of the Cetra, a near-extinct precursor race who resided in a "Promised Land," which Shinra covets for its boundless Mako reserves. The group meets a talking feline-like creature called [[Red XIII]] ([[Max Mittelman]]/[[Kappei Yamaguchi]]), who explains that the ghostly entities are called Whispers. They exist to ensure that the course of destiny is not altered by correcting any deviations from this course. Meanwhile, Sephiroth infiltrates Shinra and steals a mysterious entity known as "[[Jenoba|Jenova]]," connected to the extinction of the Cetra.
In a confrontation at the top of Shinra headquarters, Sephiroth murders the president of Shinra. Shinra's son [[Rufus Shinra|Rufus]] ([[Josh Bowman]]/[[Tōru Ōkawa]]) assumes control of the company and fights Cloud, but is defeated. Cloud and his allies flee the scene via the Midgar Expressway but find Sephiroth waiting for them at the end. After defeating Whisper Harbinger, an entity formed by an amalgam of Whispers, Cloud's group battles Sephiroth. Sephiroth separates Cloud from the group, asking him to join him and defy fate. Cloud refuses and fights Sephiroth, but is defeated, although Sephiroth spares him and departs. Meanwhile, as Cloud's group leaves Midgar to stop Sephiroth, SOLDIER [[Zack Fair]] (Caleb Pierce/[[Kenichi Suzumura]]) ends up alive and defeats an army of Shinra forces, and departs with Cloud to Midgar.
''Intergrade'' adds additional ending scenes showing Cloud and his group arriving at the village of Kalm after hitching a ride with Chocobo Bill, and Zack entering the Sector 5 church searching for Aerith.
===Intermission===
Shortly after the bombing of Mako Reactor 5, [[Yuffie Kisaragi]] (Suzie Yeung/[[Yumi Kakazu]]), a ninja working for Wutai, arrives at Midgar and meets up with her partner Sonon Kusakabe (Aleks Le/[[Yoshimasa Hosoya]]) in order to steal Shinra's "Ultimate Materia." With the help of a local Avalanche cell, Yuffie and Sonon infiltrate the lab under Shinra headquarters and fight through Shinra's forces before discovering that the Ultimate Materia is not yet complete. As they try to escape, they are confronted by a Shinra supersoldier named [[Characters of the Final Fantasy VII series#Deepground|Nero]] ([[Sean Chiplock]]/[[Ryōtarō Okiayu]]). Outmatched, Sonon sacrifices himself to ensure Yuffie can escape. She leaves Shinra headquarters just in time to see the Sector 7 plate fall. Sometime later, Yuffie has left Midgar and muses that to achieve her desire to see Shinra's downfall, she will need a team to help her.

''Final Fantasy VII'' was developed by [[Square (video game company)|Square]] for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] console and released in 1997. Its staff included producer, co-writer and series creator [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], director and co-writer Yoshinori Kitase, artist [[Yusuke Naora]], character designer and co-writer [[Tetsuya Nomura]], and writer [[Kazushige Nojima]]. The game was a critical and commercial success, and established the ''Final Fantasy'' series as a major franchise. It was expanded through the multimedia project ''[[Compilation of Final Fantasy VII]]'', comprising additional games, films, and other media.
In the early 2000s, Square announced a remake for [[PlayStation 2]] alongside ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy IX|IX]]'', but nothing further was heard of the project.
Demand for a remake grew following a [[PlayStation 3]] tech demo at the 2005 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]], showcasing the opening of ''Final Fantasy VII'' with Square's new [[Crystal Tools]] engine, in which, at the time, was known as its codename, the White Engine. Further demand came during the game's impending tenth anniversary in 2007. On both occasions, Square denied that any remake was in development, for reasons including their focus on new games, the necessity to cut elements to make a remake manageable, the difficulty of developing for modern hardware, and the amount of development time it would require.
The ''Remake'' project began when ''Final Fantasy'' producer [[Shinji Hashimoto]] broached the subject to Kitase, Nojima, and Nomura. All three were reaching a stage of life that they defined as "that age": all felt that if they waited much longer, they might not be alive to or would be too old to develop a remake, and passing the project on to a new generation did not feel right.
===Design===
[[File:Characters_of_Final_Fantasy_VII_Remake.png|thumb|left|upright=1.81|The cast of the game was redesigned in a more realistic style. Left to right: [[Red XIII]], [[Aerith Gainsborough]], [[Cloud Strife]], [[Barret Wallace]], and [[Tifa Lockhart]].]]
The game entered full production by late 2015, led by Business Division 1, an internal production team within [[Square Enix]].
While the team had the option of simply remastering ''Final Fantasy VII'' with better graphics as many fans had requested, they noted that its graphics and many of its mechanics had become dated by modern standards. With this in mind, they decided to do a full remake, rebuilding the game systems to suit contemporary tastes and using current gaming technology to recreate the world. The team aimed to retain all of the gameplay mechanics popular in the original game, including [[Active Time Battle]], while merging them with the action-based system.
Rather than using the character models and graphical style of ''Advent Children'', which by that point had been developed using ten-year-old technology, the team decided to create new designs and models for characters: Nomura wished to balance the realism of ''Advent Children'' with cartoon stylization. Nomura was in charge of the revamped main character designs, while designer Roberto Ferrari was in charge of designs for secondary characters. Character modeling was supervised by [[Visual Works]], Square Enix's CGI development branch. Tifa Lockhart's original appearance was changed to make her look more realistic as members from the staff realized her design would not fit fight scenes.
Instead of creating a new engine, Square Enix licensed [[Epic Games]]' [[Unreal Engine 4]] to develop the game, with Square Enix and Epic Games Japan working together to optimize the engine for ''Remake''. The team received technical assistance from the developers of ''Kingdom Hearts III'', as the latter game was developed using the same engine. The game's lighting is augmented with the lighting engine Enlighten. To help with the action gameplay and video quality, Square Enix originally partnered with video game developer [[CyberConnect2]], with the two companies keeping in close contact due to different development styles.
In 2017, the game's development focus shifted from being developed with external partners to being a primarily internal project. When the company first started the ''Remake'' project, the team had to decide the entire scope of the project. There were two directions possible: expand upon the original with multiple releases or include the entire scope of the original game in a single release. The team started to investigate what were the essential parts of the original and what parts are what the fans absolutely had to see; they quickly decided that there were so many parts that are essential and the fans would be upset if the team had to cut out anything. A single release with more depth would not be possible without cutting out parts of the original story. In the end, the team decided the best option for the project was to go for the highest level possible (such as within the city of Midgar, which was mostly inaccessible in the original) with an expanded story in multiple releases. Each game is planned to be on a similar scale to ''Final Fantasy XIII''. The first part focuses on the city of Midgar due to its iconic status among the ''Final Fantasy'' community.
Regarding the scope for the first part of the ''Remake'', Nomura mentioned that many were worried about how the company would be able to make a whole game based solely on Midgar, but he didn't think it would be a problem. Nomura said it takes about 7 hours to go through the Midgar section in the original game, going through the same gameplay in the Remake with 3D map in Midgar and new scenario, plus the time it takes to go from one point to another adds up. The overall gameplay of the ''Remake'' would be well enough to cover a whole game. The story and scenario writer, Nojima, also added that stopping the game at the end of Midgar would also allow for an adequate amount of story scenarios to be put in as well. Nomura further added that level designs would have to change again after the party leaves Midgar. If the developers were to do that, they would also have to split up other scenarios and even if they add new gameplay, it would have to end in an abrupt point of the story. That's why they felt that if they had everything focused in Midgar, they wouldn't have to split up any of the story elements that happen there.
===Scenario===
While developing the scenario, the team needed to work carefully, so the game did not appear too nostalgic. They needed to make decisions about what could be carried over from the original and what needed adjustment due to changes in [[social norms]] since the original's release. Despite there already being a story in place, which greatly simplified production on some fronts, Nojima was brought back in to create new story material. The scenario for the first part was completed in December 2015, covering the beginning of the game to the escape from Midgar. Kitase observed that despite 23 years passing since the original game was released, the themes of economic inequality, corporate monopoly, and environmentalism were still relevant to the current day. Nomura expressed regret that other areas of Midgar, such as the upper plate, were inaccessible in the original game and wanted to address that in ''Remake'' in order to give players a better sense of the city and its culture. The roles of previously minor characters were also expanded for this purpose.
Despite being marketed as a remake, the narrative has multiple changes from the original game, such as Barret being attacked by the antagonist Sephiroth and saved by a Whisper. Sephiroth appears during the Midgar scenario despite not being properly introduced until a flashback Cloud experiences. Vice noted that Cloud sees the future of Aerith in the original 1997 game, leaving her fate unknown to returning fans. [[Yoshinori Kitase]] refrained from explaining the reason for the changes from the narrative: "I want to let you know is that all of the lore from the works created after the original game, the [''Compilation of Final Fantasy VII''], that's all very much in the base of the canon for the remake, and going forward it will be too".
The main characters were adjusted in various ways for ''Remake''. Rather than the "cool and collected" Cloud as seen in other games, ''Remake'' depicts his apathetic attitude as a façade to mask his insecurities. Nojima wanted to convey that his standoffishness could be seen as lame. Cloud's initial redesign for ''Remake'' departed more dramatically from the original's, but was later altered to more closely resemble Nomura's design. It was important to Hamaguchi to include a scene wherein Cloud has an intimate conversation with one of his teammates based on the player's choices in homage to the "date" scene from the original game. The development team avoided playing favorites between Tifa and Aerith, treating them both as main heroes. In addition to returning characters, the team decided to expand the role of minor characters and write new characters. Cloud's interactions with AVALANCHE members Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie further his character development and deepen the world of the story. However, Kitase reasoned that the original's ''Jaws''-like approach would be ineffective because even new players were too familiar with the character. Hamaguchi pitched an alternate ending in which Cloud faces off with Sephiroth, which led to him appearing more and more in the remake.
The game is fully voiced, with the original plan being for the voice actors from the [[List of computer-animated films|CGI]] film ''[[Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children]]'' to reprise their roles. For the English dub, [[Cody Christian]] commented on replacing [[Steve Burton (actor)|Steve Burton]] voicing Cloud, stating, "Steve, you paved the way. You made this character what it is and have contributed in shaping a legacy" and thus wanted to not let Burton down with his take on the character. John Eric Bentley voiced Barret, a character he admired when he played the 1997 game. He felt his familiarity with the original work improved his performance, aided by the translators who explained the context for his scenes. He wanted his portrayal of Barret to be multifaceted and serve as a positive example of [[Racial representations in video games|Black representation in games]]. Briana White (Aerith) studied [[Maaya Sakamoto]]'s acting in order to appeal to fans. Meanwhile, Britt Baron had little knowledge of Tifa when being cast, but grew to like her character. Other prominent actors include [[Erica Lindbeck]] (Jessie), [[Gideon Emery]] (Biggs), and [[Matt Jones (actor)|Matt Jones]] (Wedge). The game employs an algorithm to adjust characters' facial motions while speaking in order to automatically match [[lip sync]]ing and emotion in every language.
===Music===

The game's soundtrack consists primarily of arrangements of pieces [[Nobuo Uematsu]] wrote for the original ''Final Fantasy VII'', with original tracks by several other series veterans, such as [[Masashi Hamauzu]] and Mitsuto Suzuki. Uematsu contributed one new track: the theme song for the game, "Hollow". It was the first time Uematsu and Kitase had worked together since ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'' (2001), with Kitase initially believing Uematsu would refuse as he had long since left Square Enix and found success as an independent composer. It was performed by Yosh, the vocalist for Survive Said the Prophet. Hamauzu also expressed honor in doing the music alongside Uematsu, as the original game was his first exposure to the series.
''Remake'' employs [[adaptive music]] in its gameplay wherein multiple arrangements of a particular track are played simultaneously, which fade in and out with the player's actions, such as entering or exiting a battle.

Following years of rumors and fan requests, ''Final Fantasy VII Remake'' was announced during Sony's conference at [[E3 2015]]. [[Visual Works]] created the announcement trailer. Square Enix's stock prices rose to their highest rating since November 2008, and the YouTube release of the reveal trailer garnered over 10 million views in the following two weeks. The game was next showcased at the 2015 PlayStation Experience, demonstrating cutscenes and gameplay from the opening sequence.
During the ''Final Fantasy'' 30th anniversary [[opening ceremony]] event hosted by Square Enix in Tokyo on January 31, 2017 – the 20th anniversary of ''Final Fantasy VII'' – the game's first piece of CGI key art was unveiled, along with announcements for a collaboration event with ''[[Mobius Final Fantasy]]''. On February 18, Nomura revealed two screenshots, showing off the updated [[HUD (video gaming)|HUD]]. Due to its lack of footage since 2015, switch to internal development, and other projects Nomura was involved in, there were concerns about the status of the project. Speaking following E3 2018, Nomura stated that the game was in development, with his full attention shifted to it when ''Kingdom Hearts III'' was completed.
After years without substantial footage, a teaser trailer was shown during PlayStation's May 2019 State of Play broadcast. Kitase revealed that the team wanted to "try something new" on the State of Play broadcast by showing the trailer. The release date, March 3, 2020, was revealed the following month in a second teaser trailer during an orchestral concert dedicated to the [[Music of the Final Fantasy VII series|music of ''Final Fantasy VII'']] in Los Angeles. Further release details were announced at the company's [[E3 2019]] press conference, including different editions of ''Remake''. Kitase later clarified at the event that Square Enix had yet to determine the number of games in the ''Remake'' series, adding that they were in the process of planning the second installment.
An extended gameplay showcase and demo was playable at E3 2019, demonstrating parts of the opening mission, including some of the exploration, combat system, and first boss battle. The playable demo received positive reception in early previews, with praise towards the graphics, gameplay and combat system. It won three awards at the [[Game Critics Awards]] for Best of Show, Best Console Game, and Best Role-Playing Game, as well as the best looking Unreal Engine game at E3 2019. Extended footage of the demo, as well as an additional trailer, was featured at the 2019 [[Tokyo Game Show]]. ''Final Fantasy VII Remake'' was initially PlayStation 4 exclusive until 2021, with no further details about its release on other platforms at the time. The release date was pushed back from March 3 to April 10, 2020. A [[game demo|demo]] was released on the [[PlayStation Store]] on March 2, 2020, covering the first chapter.
In March 2020, Square Enix revealed that Europe and Australia would receive physical copies of ''Final Fantasy VII Remake'' early, due to growing concerns of the effect of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] on distribution. This did not apply to downloads, as they were not directly affected by the global supply chain. Artwork of Cloud was used on buildings in Los Angeles to promote the game.
The same year in June, a scene from ''Final Fantasy VII Remake'' was reproduced for the 8-bit [[NEC PC-88]] computer by Japanese programmer Soba P.
An upgraded version of ''Remake'' for the [[PlayStation 5]], titled ''Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade'', was released on June 10, 2021, featuring improved visuals and shorter load times, available at no additional cost to owners of the PS4 version. It includes a PS5-exclusive DLC expansion titled ''Episode Intermission''{{efn|Stylized as ''Episode INTERmission''.}} featuring the playable character [[Yuffie Kisaragi]], who does not appear in the Midgar segment of the original game. The DLC expansion is included with the purchase of ''Intergrade'', but must be purchased separately if using the free upgrade from the PS4 version. ''Intergrade'' adds the ability to use traditional turn-based controls while in the game's normal difficulty mode, a photo mode, and better overall performance in framerate and resolution.
A [[Porting|port]] of ''Intergrade'' was released for [[Windows]] on December 16, 2021, via the [[Epic Games Store]]. While anticipation was high, the port was criticised by players and critics for its stuttering and lack of customization, both stemming from a lack of optimization. It was released on [[Steam (service)|Steam]] on June 17, 2022. Square published a novel focused on the backstories of Tifa and Aerith, ''Final Fantasy VII Remake: Traces of Two Pasts''.
''Remake'' is the first in a planned trilogy of games remaking ''Final Fantasy VII''. The second, ''Final Fantasy VII Rebirth'', was released on February 29, 2024. A prequel, ''[[Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion]]'' – a remaster of the 2007 game ''[[Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII]]'' – was released in December 2022. Music from ''Remake'' was included in the 2023 rhythm game ''[[Theatrhythm Final Bar Line]]''.

''Final Fantasy VII Remake'' received "generally favorable" reviews, according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]], Tom Marks of ''[[IGN]]'' calls the game a "complete reinvention", praising the combat system. Nahila Bonfiglio of ''[[The Daily Dot]]'' regarded it as one of the best games of 2020 based on multiple aspects that would appeal to the audience. ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly|EGM]]'' claimed the game was captivating like the original. ''[[Eurogamer]]'' also highly regarded the remake, to the point of finding it superior to the original title.
The narrative was praised for the characters and their arcs. ''Destructoid'' agreed about the cast, most notably Aerith, noting her fun characterization. The handling of the city of Midgar and expansion of minor characters were praised by the media too.
Critical response to the new combat has been positive, partly due to the strategy needed and the distinctive fighting style of each playable character, such as Cloud wielding a sword, in contrast to Barret's shooting from afar. ''GamesRadar'' also praised the combat for the strategy required, due to each enemy having a weakness, and the variety among the characters thanks to their unique traits. ''RPGamer'' praised both the return of Materia used to provide magic attacks and the addition of upgradeable weapons in order to let players decide which equipment they want to use. ''RPGamer'' felt that ''Remake'' relied on "padding" to expand on the areas of the game, which they considered linear for the genre. ''GamesRadar'' criticized some of the side-quests in the game as lackluster though the interactions were better received. ''EGM'' claimed that some quests had too much padding, citing an example where the player has to constantly change the playable character to open multiple doors in the Shinra headquarters. ''[[Easy Allies]]'' said that despite the linear gameplay, the reviewers finished the game in 38 hours, and still had plenty of quests left to complete.
In regards to ''Intergrade'', Siliconera praised the focus on Yuffie's story even if she comes across as annoying due to her younger personality but felt her relationship with Sonon improved it. Besides the new minigame, Siliconera praised the improved graphics from ''Intergrade''. Enjoying the option of playing directly with the sidestory, ''Destructoid'' found Yuffie instead likable to the point of coming across as realistic and enjoyed her own style of gameplay. PC Invasion also praised the framerate, making the PC version highly recommendable to play rather than the other ones.
===Sales===
''Final Fantasy VII Remake'' sold over 3.5 million units worldwide within three days. This made it one of the biggest launches for a PlayStation 4 game and the fastest-selling PS4 exclusive, surpassing the launch sales of ''[[Spider-Man (2018 video game)|Marvel's Spider-Man]]'' (3.3 million; 2018) and ''[[God of War (2018 video game)|God of War]]'' (3.1 million; 2018). By August 2020, that figure had increased to over {{nowrap|5 million}} on PS4. By September 2023, the game had shipped and digitally sold over 7 million units worldwide.
In Japan, ''Final Fantasy VII Remake'' sold over a million units during its first week, with the game sold out in many stores.
