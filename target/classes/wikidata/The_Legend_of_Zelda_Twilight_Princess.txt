{{nihongo foot|'''''The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess'''''|ゼルダの伝説 トワイライトプリンセス|Zeruda no Densetsu: Towairaito Purinsesu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 2006 [[action-adventure game]] developed and published by [[Nintendo]] for the [[GameCube]] and [[Wii]]. Originally planned for release exclusively on the GameCube in November 2005, ''Twilight Princess'' was delayed by Nintendo to allow its developers to refine the game, add more content, and [[Porting#Porting of video games|port]] it to the Wii. The Wii version was a [[launch game]] in North America in November 2006, and in Japan, Europe, and Australia the following month. The GameCube version was released in December 2006 as the final first-party game for the console.
The story focuses on series protagonist [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]], who tries to prevent [[Hyrule]] from being engulfed by a corrupted [[Parallel universes in fiction|parallel dimension]] known as the Twilight Realm. To do so, he takes the form of both a [[Universe of The Legend of Zelda#Hylian|Hylian]] and a wolf, and he is assisted by a mysterious [[imp]] named [[Midna]]. The game takes place over a century after ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time|Ocarina of Time]]'' and ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask|Majora's Mask]]'', in an [[Alternate history|alternate timeline]] from ''[[The Wind Waker]]''.
''Twilight Princess'' was critically acclaimed upon its release, received numerous [[game of the year]] awards, and has been called [[List of video games considered the best|one of the greatest video games ever made]]. By 2015, it had sold 8.85 million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling ''Zelda'' game until being overtaken by ''[[Breath of the Wild]]'' in April 2018. In 2011, the Wii version was rereleased under the [[Nintendo Selects]] label. A high-definition [[Video game remake|remaster]] based on the GameCube version, ''The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess HD'', was released for the [[Wii U]] in March 2016.
==Gameplay==
{{See also|The Legend of Zelda#Gameplay}}
[[File:Zelda - Twilight Princess - stab.jpg|thumb|left|An arrow points at an enemy whom [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] is targeting as he prepares to swing his sword ([[GameCube]] version).|alt=A boy in a green tunic holds a shield while swinging his sword towards an enemy.]]
''The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess'' is an [[action-adventure game]] focused on combat, exploration, and puzzle-solving. It uses the basic control scheme introduced in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time|Ocarina of Time]]'', including context-sensitive action buttons and L-targeting (Z-targeting on the [[Wii]]), a system that allows the player to keep [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]]'s view focused on an enemy or important object while moving and attacking. Link can walk, run, and attack, and he will automatically jump when running off of or reaching for a ledge. Link uses a sword and shield in combat, complemented with secondary weapons and items, including a bow and arrows, a boomerang, and bombs. While L-targeting, projectile-based weapons can be fired at a target without the need for manual aiming.
The context-sensitive button mechanic allows one button to serve a variety of functions, such as talking, opening doors, and pushing, pulling, and throwing objects. The on-screen display shows what action, if any, the button will trigger, determined by the situation. For example, if Link is holding a rock, the context-sensitive button will cause Link to throw the rock if he is moving or targeting an object or enemy or place the rock on the ground if he is standing still.
The [[GameCube]] and Wii versions feature several minor differences in their controls and gameplay. The Wii version of the game makes use of the motion sensors and built-in speaker of the [[Wii Remote]]. The speaker emits the sounds of a bowstring when shooting an arrow, [[Midna]]'s laugh when she gives advice to Link, and the series' trademark "chime" when discovering secrets. The player controls Link's sword by swinging the Wii Remote. Other attacks are triggered using similar gestures with the [[Wii Remote#Nunchuk|Nunchuk]]. In the GameCube version, players can control the camera freely, without entering a special "lookaround" mode required on the Wii; however, in the GameCube version, only two of Link's secondary weapons can be equipped at a time, as opposed to four in the Wii version.
The game features nine dungeons—large, contained areas where Link battles enemies, collects items, and solves puzzles. Link navigates these dungeons and fights a [[Boss (video games)|boss]] at the end in order to obtain an item or otherwise advance the plot. The dungeons are connected by a large [[overworld]], across which Link can travel on foot; on his horse, [[Epona (The Legend of Zelda)|Epona]]; or by teleporting with Midna's assistance.
When Link enters the Twilight Realm, the void that corrupts parts of [[Universe of The Legend of Zelda#Hyrule|Hyrule]], he transforms into a wolf. He is eventually able to transform between his [[Universe of The Legend of Zelda#Hylian|Hylian]] and wolf forms at will. As a wolf, Link loses the ability to use his sword, shield, or any secondary items; he instead attacks by biting and defends primarily by dodging attacks. "Wolf Link" gains several key advantages in return—he moves faster than he does on foot as a human, digs holes to create new passages and uncover buried items, and has improved senses, including the ability to follow scent trails. On his back, he also carries Midna, a small imp-like creature who gives him hints, uses an energy field to attack enemies, helps him jump long distances, and eventually allows him to "warp" to any of several preset locations throughout the overworld. Using Link's wolf senses, the player can see and listen to the wandering spirits of those affected by the Twilight, as well as hunt for enemy ghosts named [[Poe (The Legend of Zelda)|Poe]]s.
The [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) of enemies in ''Twilight Princess'' is more advanced than that of enemies in ''[[The Wind Waker]]''. Enemies react to defeated companions and to arrows or slingshot pellets that pass by, and they can detect Link from a greater distance than was possible in previous games.
==Plot==
{{Further|The Legend of Zelda#Fictional chronology|label1=Fictional chronology of ''The Legend of Zelda''}}
The game begins with a teenage boy named Link, who works as a ranch hand in Ordon Village. One day, [[Universe of The Legend of Zelda#Bulblin|Bulblins]] take away the village's children. Link pursues and encounters a wall of Twilight. A Twilight monster pulls him beyond the wall into the Twilight-shrouded forest, where he is transformed into a [[wolf]] and imprisoned. Link is soon freed by a creature named Midna, who offers to help him if he obeys her unconditionally. She guides him to [[Princess Zelda]], who explains that [[Characters in The Legend of Zelda series#Zant|Zant]], the Sorcerer/Usurper King of the Twili, invaded [[Universe of The Legend of Zelda#Hyrulean geography|Hyrule Castle]] and forced her to surrender. The kingdom became enveloped in Twilight, turning all its inhabitants besides Link and Zelda into invisible spirits. To save Hyrule, Link, aided by Midna, must first revive the [[Universe of The Legend of Zelda#Light Spirits|Light Spirits]] by entering the Twilight-covered regions and recovering the Spirits' light from the Twilight beings that had stolen it. Once revitalized, each Spirit returns Link to his Hylian form and informs Link and Midna of the hidden location of a Fused Shadow; one of the fragments of a powerful relic that will have to be used to match Zant's power to defeat him. During this time, the ghost of a [[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time|departed swordsman]] (the same incarnation of Link from ''Ocarina of Time'' and ''Majora's Mask''), the Hero's Shade, also appears to provide swordsmanship training he had failed to pass on before his untimely death, as well as information regarding Link's destiny in Hyrule.
During his journey, Link also finds Ordon Village's children and assists the monkeys of Faron, the [[Universe of The Legend of Zelda#Goron|Gorons]] of Eldin, and the [[Universe of The Legend of Zelda#Zora|Zoras]] of Lanayru. After restoring the Light Spirits and obtaining the Fused Shadows, Link and Midna are ambushed by Zant, who takes away the fragments. Midna calls him out for abusing his tribe's magic, but Zant reveals that his power comes from another source, and he uses it to trap Link in his wolf state. Failing to persuade Midna into joining forces with him, Zant attempts to dispose of her by exposing her to the light of Lanayru's light spirit. Bringing a dying Midna to Zelda, Link learns from her that he needs the [[Universe of The Legend of Zelda#Master Sword|Master Sword]] to remove Zant's curse and she proceeds to sacrifice herself to heal Midna, vanishing mysteriously. Moved by Zelda's act of selflessness, Midna starts to care more about Link and the fate of his world.
After gaining the Master Sword, Link is cleansed of the curse that kept him in wolf form. Deep within the Gerudo Desert, Link and Midna search for the Mirror of Twilight, the only known gateway between Hyrule and the Twilight Realm, but discover that it is broken. The [[Characters in The Legend of Zelda series#Sages|Sages]] there explain that Zant tried to destroy it, but only managed to shatter it into fragments; only the true ruler of the [[Universe of The Legend of Zelda#Twili|Twili]] can completely destroy the mirror. They also relate that they once used it to banish [[Ganon]]dorf, the [[Universe of The Legend of Zelda#Gerudo|Gerudo]] leader who attempted to steal the [[Triforce]], to the Twilight Realm after failing to execute him. Link and Midna set out to retrieve the missing shards of the mirror. Once it has been fully restored, the Sages reveal to Link that Midna is actually the true ruler of the Twili, usurped and cursed into her current form by Zant. Confronting Zant, Link and Midna learn that he forged a pact with Ganondorf, who asked for his assistance in subjugating Hyrule. After Link defeats Zant, Midna recovers the Fused Shadows and kills Zant after learning that only Ganondorf's defeat can release her from her curse.
Returning to Hyrule, Link and Midna find Ganondorf in Hyrule Castle, with a lifeless Zelda suspended above him. Ganondorf fights Link by possessing Zelda and then transforming into a gigantic boar-like beast, but Link defeats him by using his wolf form, and the power Midna received from Zelda is able to resuscitate her. Ganondorf revives, and Midna teleports Link and Zelda outside the castle so she can hold him off with the Fused Shadows. However, as Hyrule Castle collapses, Ganondorf emerges from it victorious, crushing the Fused Shadow piece that Midna wore on her head, and pursues Link on horseback. Assisted by Zelda and the Light Spirits, Link eventually knocks Ganondorf off his horse and duels him on foot before finishing him off with the Master Sword. With Ganondorf dead, the Light Spirits revive Midna and restore her to her true form. After bidding farewell to Link and Zelda, Midna returns home and destroys the Mirror of Twilight, ultimately severing the link between Hyrule and the Twilight Realm. As Hyrule Castle is rebuilt, Link leaves Ordon Village, heading to parts unknown.

===Inception as a GameCube game===
[[File:Eiji Aonuma - 453606822.jpg|thumb|alt=A photo of a bespectacled Eiji Aonuma near a microphone|[[Eiji Aonuma]], the director of ''Twilight Princess'', at the 2007 [[Game Developers Conference]]]]
In 2003, [[Nintendo]] announced a new ''The Legend of Zelda'' game for the GameCube by the same team that had created the [[Cel shading|cel-shaded]] ''The Wind Waker''. At the following year's [[Game Developers Conference]], director [[Eiji Aonuma]] unintentionally revealed that the game's sequel was in development under the working title ''The Wind Waker 2''; it was set to use a similar graphical style to that of its predecessor. [[Nintendo#Nintendo of America|Nintendo of America]] told Aonuma that North American sales of ''The Wind Waker'' were sluggish because its cartoon appearance created the impression that the game was designed for a young audience. Concerned that the sequel would have the same problem, Aonuma expressed to producer [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] that he wanted to create a realistic ''Zelda'' game that would appeal to the North American market and meet Miyamoto's original vision of realism for the series. Miyamoto, hesitant about solely changing the game's presentation, suggested the team's focus should instead be on coming up with gameplay innovations. He advised that Aonuma should start by doing what could not be done in ''Ocarina of Time'', particularly horseback combat. Early development of what would become ''Twilight Princess'' began and special care was taken to improve the realism of the horseriding, with lead character designer Keisuke Nishimori riding a horse for himself to feel what it was like.
Just as the [[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|original ''Legend of Zelda'']] game was inspired by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings|''The Lord of the Rings'' novels]], the aesthetic of ''Twilight Princess'' was inspired by the [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''Lord of the Rings'']] films, as they had just come out and were very popular at the time. The game was developed with having a large convincing world in mind, one with a vast scale to meet the expectation for fantasy worlds that audiences had become accustomed to with ''The Lord of the Rings''.
In four months, Aonuma's team managed to present realistic horseback riding, a true sequel to it was released for the [[Nintendo DS]] in 2007, in the form of ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass|Phantom Hourglass]]''. Miyamoto explained in interviews that the graphical style was chosen to satisfy demand and that it better fit the theme of an older incarnation of Link. The game runs on a modified ''The Wind Waker'' [[Game engine|engine]].
Prior ''Zelda'' games have employed a theme of two separate, yet connected, worlds. In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past|A Link to the Past]]'', Link travels between a "Light World" and a "Dark World"; in ''Ocarina of Time'', as well as in ''[[Oracle of Ages]]'', Link travels between two different time periods. The ''Zelda'' team sought to reuse this motif in the series' latest installment. It was suggested that Link transform into a wolf, much like he metamorphoses into a rabbit in the Dark World of ''A Link to the Past''. The concept for Link to transform into a wolf and its surrounding narrative elements came from a dream that Aonuma had while overseas on a business trip. He dreamt that he was a wolf, locked inside a cage, and, after he woke up, he was confused and disoriented and it took a while for him to remember where he was. Takano created the script for the story scenes, Originally, Link was planned to be a wolf from the game's start to bluntly contrast the ''Ocarina of Time'' formula, but this was changed so that new players could be eased into the ''Zelda'' series' traditional gameplay and narrative formula. The narrative premise in the story regarding the children of Ordon village getting kidnapped was an example of the game featuring darker story elements than any past iteration.
From a gameplay perspective, the Twilight Realm portions of the game were vaguely inspired by the fact that prior ''Zelda'' games had always distinctively separated dungeons from the overworld. The team wondered what the result would be if a traditional ''Zelda'' dungeon was placed inside the open world instead. This resulted in the hunt for Tears of Light the player partakes in when in the Twilight-covered world. The atmosphere of the Twilight-covered Hyrule, as well as the Twilight Realm dungeon later in the game, were intended to make players feel uncomfortable. Special care was taken, however, to ensure that this was balanced right, so that it did not make the player so uncomfortable that they did not want to progress further or could not enjoy the experience.
Aonuma left his team working on the new idea while he produced ''[[The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap|The Minish Cap]]'' for the [[Game Boy Advance]]. When he returned, he found the ''Twilight Princess'' team struggling. Emphasis on the parallel worlds and the wolf transformation had made Link's character unbelievable. Aonuma also felt the gameplay lacked the caliber of innovation found in ''Phantom Hourglass'', which was being developed with [[touchscreen|touch controls]] for the Nintendo DS. At the same time, the Wii was under development with the code name "Revolution". Miyamoto thought that the Revolution's [[pointing device]], the Wii Remote, was well suited for aiming arrows in ''Zelda'', and he suggested that Aonuma consider using it.
===Transition to the Wii===
Aonuma had anticipated creating a ''Zelda'' game for what would later become the Wii, but had assumed that he would need to complete ''Twilight Princess'' first. His team began work developing a pointing-based interface for the bow and arrow, and Aonuma found that aiming directly at the screen gave the game a new feel, just like the DS control scheme for ''Phantom Hourglass''. Aonuma felt confident this was the only way to proceed, but worried about consumers who had been anticipating a GameCube release. Developing two versions would mean delaying the previously announced 2005 release, still disappointing the consumer. Nintendo President [[Satoru Iwata]] felt that having both versions would satisfy users in the end, even though they would have to wait for the finished product. Aonuma then started working on both versions in parallel.
Transferring GameCube development to the Wii was relatively simple, since the Wii was being created to be compatible with GameCube software. At [[E3 2005]], Nintendo released a small number of [[Nintendo DS game card]]s containing a preview trailer for ''Twilight Princess''. They also announced that a ''Zelda'' title would appear on the Wii (then codenamed "Revolution"), but were not clear to the media if this meant ''Twilight Princess'' or a different game.
The team worked on a Wii control scheme, adapting camera control and the fighting mechanics to the new interface. A prototype was created that used a swinging gesture to control the sword from a first-person viewpoint but was unable to show the variety of Link's movements. When the third-person view was restored, Aonuma thought it felt strange to swing the Wii Remote with the right hand to control the sword in Link's left hand, so the entire world map was mirrored for the Wii version. Details about Wii controls began to surface in December 2005 when British publication ''[[NGC Magazine]]'' claimed that when a GameCube copy of ''Twilight Princess'' was played on the Revolution, it would give the player the option of using the Revolution controller. Miyamoto confirmed the Revolution controller-functionality in an interview with Nintendo of Europe and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' reported this soon after. However, support for the Wii controller did not make it into the GameCube release. At [[E3 2006]], Nintendo confirmed that both versions would be available at the [[Wii launch]], and had a playable version of ''Twilight Princess'' for the Wii.
Nintendo staff members reported that demo users complained about the difficulty of the control scheme. Aonuma realized that his team had implemented Wii controls under the mindset of "forcing" users to adapt, instead of making the system intuitive and easy to use. He began rethinking the controls with Miyamoto to focus on comfort and ease. The camera movement was reworked and item controls were changed to avoid accidental button presses. In addition, the new item system required use of the button that had previously been used for the sword. To solve this, sword controls were transferred back to gestures—something E3 attendees had commented they would like to see. This reintroduced the problem of using a right-handed swing to control a left-handed sword attack. The team did not have enough time before release to rework Link's character model, so they instead flipped the entire game—everything was made a mirror image. Link was now right-handed, and references to "east" and "west" were reversed. The GameCube version, however, was left with the original orientation. The ''Twilight Princess'' player's guide focuses on the Wii version, but has a section in the back with mirror-image maps for GameCube users.
===Music and sound===
The game's score was composed by [[Toru Minegishi]] and Asuka Ohta, with series regular [[Koji Kondo]] serving as the sound supervisor. Minegishi took charge of composition and sound design in ''Twilight Princess'', providing all field and dungeon music. For the trailers, three pieces were written by different composers, two of which were created by [[Mahito Yokota]] and Kondo. [[Michiru Ōshima]] created orchestral arrangements for the three compositions, later to be performed by an ensemble conducted by Taizo Takemoto.
Media requests at the trade show prompted Kondo to consider using orchestral music for the other tracks in the game as well, a notion reinforced by his preference for live instruments. Kondo later cited the lack of interactivity that comes with orchestral music as one of the main reasons for the decision.
=== Technical vulnerability ===
Following the discovery of a [[buffer overflow]] [[Vulnerability (computing)|vulnerability]] in the Wii version of ''Twilight Princess'', an [[Exploit (computer security)|exploit]] known as the "Twilight Hack" was developed, allowing the [[Execution (computing)|execution]] of custom code from a [[Secure Digital]] (SD) card on the [[Video game console|console]]. A specifically designed [[saved game|save file]] would cause the game to load [[unsigned code]], which could include [[Executable and Linkable Format]] (ELF) programs and [[Wii homebrew|homebrew Wii applications]]. Versions 3.3 and 3.4 of the [[Wii Menu]] prevented copying exploited save files onto the console until circumvention methods were discovered, and version 4.0 of the Wii Menu [[Patch (computing)|patched]] the vulnerability.

A [[High-definition video|high-definition]] [[Video game remake|remaster]] of the game, ''The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess HD'', was developed by [[Tantalus Media]] for the [[Wii U]]. Announced during a [[Nintendo Direct]] presentation on November 13, 2015, it features enhanced graphics and [[Amiibo]] functionality.
The idea for a high-definition version of ''Twilight Princess'' first originated during the production of ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild|Breath of the Wild]]''. Nintendo experimented with an HD version of ''Twilight Princess'' running on [[Wii U]] development kits when trying to settle on a graphical style for the new game. This ultimately led to the production of ''[[The Wind Waker HD]]'', whose success encouraged the ''Zelda'' team to pursue other high-definition remasters. After its release, which was developed internally at [[Nintendo]] in only six months, the ''Zelda'' team settled on an HD [[Video game remake|remaster]] of ''Twilight Princess''. At the time, most of the ''Zelda'' team was preoccupied with ''Breath of the Wild'', so Nintendo sought a partnership with an external [[Video game developer|development studio]], the Australia-based [[Tantalus Media]], to work on ''Twilight Princess HD''.
According to [[Eiji Aonuma]], who directed the original release and produced ''Twilight Princess HD'', ensuring the remaster would take advantage of the Wii U GamePad was a point of focus early in the title's development. The control scheme used in the [[GameCube]] version was adapted for the remaster due to similarities between the button layouts of the two [[Video game console|consoles]]' controllers. A commitment to "preserving the feel of the original" inspired several design decisions, such as keeping the [[frame rate]] at 30 frames per second. Tomomi Sano, the assistant director of the Wii U version, noted the degree of refinement the graphics would receive required much consideration: "When we created more precise [[3D modeling|models]] of objects to go with the higher [[Display resolution|resolution]], we found that everything was too clear and we lost that soft and delicate atmosphere that you get in particular at twilight or with the light in a forest".
Certain bundles of the game contain a Wolf Link Amiibo figurine, which unlocks a Wii U-exclusive dungeon called the "Cave of Shadows" and can carry data over to ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild|Breath of the Wild]]''. In the Cave of Shadows, Link fights waves of enemies while restricted to his wolf form. Other ''Zelda''-related Amiibo figurines have distinct functions: Link and Toon Link replenish arrows, Zelda and [[Princess Zelda#Sheik|Sheik]] restore Link's health, and Ganondorf causes Link to take twice as much damage. A three-disc original soundtrack consisting of 108 pieces from the game was released in Japan in July 2016.
