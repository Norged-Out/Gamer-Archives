[[What is the worst grind in GBF]]


Currently farming for the Judgement summon and evoker, and I honestly think I'm losing it farming Astras. Luckily even at my noobish level I'm able to 0b with the help of Grand Ferry and a relatively stacked light grid, but without it I'm not even sure if I'd have the determination to see this through. I can't imagine what it was like farming for these guys prior to the Tales of Arcarum events (and I'm seriously kicking myself for not logging on for Esta and Fraux's).

That being said, as a newer player I acknowledge this is probably just the tip of the iceberg, and there's probably significantly more lengthy and tedious grinds to come. What is in your opinion the worst grind in GBF?


I tried farming for the first 6* upgrade of a single eternal once. Instantly became a seasonal player upon reading the mats required.
    What's a seasonal player?
        Back for Summer and Xmas/New years freebies, and depending on where on the scale you are, maybe checking out some events here and there
    It's also a veteran check to progress past 110 anyway since you need all 10 of them recruited.
        Recruiting is easier after the first one imo. Uncapping is the real hurdle.
            Takes time and gold bars, which you are sort of naturally gated on if you're new.

You're neither farming them nor drowning in giveaways in a short period of time.
                The gold bar gate is very miniscule because you get so many gold bars from Rise of the Beasts if you're new
                It depends on how how often RotB is running (and how quickly you ranked up since that gates Shenxian), I guess. I was able to get the gold bricks without much trouble that way.
            I may be behind on what grinds exist, but it feels like nothing else is as much of a light whorl, scroll, and dragon seed drain as uncapping the Eternals. At worst, you're looking at element changing 109 weapons because you can get one Eternal for free. 

It's definitely easy and brainless once you acquire enough dark units with passive TA to semi-auto the entire process, but you still need to sit there as you get stupid amounts of light mats you don't burn as quickly through from simply uncapping light characters.
        I mean.. I recruited them all before I got my first to 100.
            It's not a question of possibility. It's just that if you're doing it for meta reasons (e.g. Song at 110 real good, Siete 130, etc), or you just really like one of them and want to focus on them, it's not an option, you still need them all.
    It's nothing in comparision to Evoker's FLB :(
    This is basically what happened to me. I didn't quite go seasonal right away but then more and more V2 fights started coming out with increasing roster/ grid requirements and I just don't care anymore. More and more high end raids with less and less motivation to do them because the entry power level required keeps climbing faster than I care to gain power.
Fucking angel halo for me, you have to do a billion runs of them, it’s multiple wave so you can’t just shortcut it, and since you want neko to make it faster it’s not even a good source of class mastery exp.
    if you have a character like grimnir (or v.grimnir) you can use him instead of neko
For me I can highlight three grinds that are nigh unbearable: The first Evoker, the first non-free Eternal, and the first Eternal FLB. Moving forward into the game you will eventually learn to do these three types of unlock almost casually, but the first is always the worst.
    Definitely can vouch for the later two, but this is my 3rd evoker (granted I got one for free), and I'm still definitely feeling the grind. Does anything in particular change after your first Evoker or is it just being used to the grind?
        You "accidentally" get mats you didnt want while grinding first one that you can use on 2nd one and etc etc
        Guess it is the latter. At one point your body just gets used to it. But ngl, having access to Here be Swords zone helps a lot, Staves doesn't contribute with almost nothing towards your progress with their unlocks.

I have five Evokers unlocked,one of which was free(Caim was the free one, unlocked Alanaan, Haaselia, Fraux and Lobelia by myself) and the process is way too long and tiresome if you only tunnelvision your progress towards it. I prefer to do other stuff in the meantime that happens to get me the materials for progression as well, and then I go back and finish the deed.

Now, for NWF weapons it's an entirely different situation...
            I honestly rushed Mundus because I heard the nodes there gives the most bang for your buck in a way. Took a bit of effort to get a 0b setup working but it was worth it, but getting only around 10 Astras per 100 chests and maybe 10-20 residually has definitely been tedious.

But yeah at least it's a grind I don't have to put much thought into, I can see myself getting used to this.
                You really should do more normal arcarum.

Normal arcarum gives more astras and ideans.
                Sounds like a dangerous mindset to get into
        You get used to the grind and your grind for the first evoker has brought in tons of materials for your next one; So long as you aren't deliberately aiming for the same elements back to back, there's less of a buffer each time depending on what sort of route you take to get all of them.

Along with your Sandbox grinding, which helps a ton for some specific mats. Sephira Stone gating suuuuuucks.
            For real. I tried unlocking two Fire Evokers in close proximity(Alanaan in March, Fraux last month) and as a result I ran out of Verums and Astras to use for uncapping Kiss of the Devil properly. I managed to solve the Astra issue after a while but farming Verums kind of sucks.
        No one is mentioning this because this community is very weird about it. But the fastest way to get evokers is to trade new world quartz for the tedious mats and let yourself be gated by straightforward things like ideans.

Ideans largely just require 9 arcarum tickets to get 4 or so from killing the boss. Astras are almost completely random. Use new world quartz to make astras to supplement whatever you're lacking when you have all of the other mats.

With this in mind, the fastest way to unlock all evokers (and the method I used) is to unlock all of the eternals so you can start getting quartz from boxes during gw. I guarantee you you will always have more than you could ever reasonably use.

At this point I have 10/10 evokers and I have Caim FLB. Lobelia is almost ready, just need to do one more domain and get a sands drop for his last weapon uncap. And all of my other NWF weapons are at least 3 stars just missing a couple of things to finish them off.

I also have 10/10 eternals with all of them FLB and 6 of them at at least 110. Eternals uncaps get WAY easier after the first one and daily angel halo pro makes it far more chill.

My approach to grinding is marathon most of it and only sprint the last 10% or so. Trading resources is always useful because you will almost always have a surplus of *something* you can trade. And if you don't have a surplus then daily host until you do.
            No one mentions it because new world quartz is an extremely limited and time-gated item. Beyond the one-time rewards from missions and tower of babyl and the ones in the shop that are never restocked, the only way to acquire more is from Tales of Arcarum and Unite and Fight events. If you trade your NWQ for farmable mats that might come back to bite you in the ass later when you need tons of them to FLB uncap your evokers and unlock their 4th skills. You need 1,200 NWQ total if you intend to collect and fully power up every evoker.
                I'm aware of this.

However if you grind the evokers slowly over time you are absolutely not being gated by NWQ there are enough consistent sources of it that you won't hit this wall before you hit other much larger walls
                    I guess that's true if you farm sandbox slowly enough. But recently with regular Tales of Arcarum events massively accelerating the efficiency of farming sandbox, a sufficiently motivated player could easily hit the NWQ wall pretty fast.


I've personally reached the point where the only things preventing me from ULB uncapping all my NWF weapons + FLB uncapping every Eternal and unlocking their 4th skills is being gated by NWQ, eternity sand and sunstones. I've finished farming every other required material.
                    GW is the most significant source of NWQ in the game at the moment, and I've finally started actually doing GW for nearly two years now. I also obtained all the other sources of NWQ (Tower, Tales, etc).

I have only about ~700 life time NWQ. And let me tell you, the time spent getting NWQ from GW to trade in for arcarum mats is much better spent on on actually farming those mats directly.
                        I mean this is anecdotal and meaningless as my experience is directly counter to yours.

Same time frame and I have every single evoker and still have a surplus of NWQ and that's while taking detours to 40 box eternals for transcendence.

It all relies on the rate at which you focus farm the mats. Trading the mats down when you need a push to get over the line requires you to understand your resources. It's the same as when people say "if you gotta ask if you need this gold moon weapon then you're not ready for it". I wouldn't blindly tell people to trade NWQ down to 0 to rush something I am saying if you have 300 NWQ and 0 evokers you are nor burning through 300 NWQ in 2 months. You can afford to trade 20 down to speed up the final step.
                            Honestly this is also a valid take. For you do to it you actually need to understand how much you value your time(and sanity) in this situation, and I wouldn't blame someone for trading a few NWQs for those final pesky Astras you need for the unlock. However, you must also shoulder the responsibility that once you spend those, your life during NWF grind might become harder, so that's the main reason why it is not a recommended approach: you cannot expect everyone to have these levels of discernment for this decision.
    The last Eternal is way worse because you ran out of Rainbow Prisms ages ago and have already been farming it for the last few you got
This might be mild but unlocking your first eternal is so tedious. Having to grind those rare weapons if you weren’t able to get them during guild wars actually made me angry. They refused to drop even with Item Drop bonus. Took me like 4-6 hours of playing to finally finish it up. Luckily after your first time, you never have to do it again.
Angel Halo for Eternals transcendence, no question. As others said, it's multi-wave so you can't just otk it and you need *so many* of those dumb low-level mats so you have to spend a ton of hours grinding that you could've put towards getting better weapons/bar farming/doing literally anything else. Someone at Cygames *really* has an inexplicable fetish for that tedious stage...

That and the 30 HL/QL anima are the worst parts of it. Otherwise, the Idean grind for Evokers uncap was pain but at least you can fast OTK it so you can get a lot of stages done in an hour; I went back to doing full Arcarum runs because they give more verum proofs etc. than the fast expedition.
    Definitely not looking forward to it, especially when I hear how much most of the eternals are only viable at certain levels. Hadn't even considered mult-wave content, that genuinely sounds miserable lol

At the same time though, I guess I've gotten addicted to the cycle of destroying my posture and mental just to be rewarded by numbers going up. Need to pace myself so I don't get burnt out lmao
        Good luck, I burnt out and took around a year off thanks to transcendence and GW grinds. Now I'm just going at a pace I'm comfortable with instead of trying to rush things.
            Yeah I took a break for like 3 months because of evoker flb, eternal transcend and last year's Halloween banner.

Then I realized I was being absurd trying to force myself to keep up with youtubers. Now I let other people do the work for me and I just copy them slowly over the course of 6 months.

Just because something is no longer the fastest comp doesn't mean it can't kill something I just need to collect the pieces.
        It's very debatable if Eternals are even worth the time doing in 2023 tbh. There's only 1 Eternal that you actually really, really want. Of the rest, 2 are fine, but you can easily go without, and then the other 7 range from extremely niche to outright useless. Most badly need additional transcendence levels to be relevant, but that's years away, if it ever happens at all. If you *really* didn't want to do the Eternals grind, you can honestly just ignore them and accumulate stuff from your daily AH Pro, with the only cost being that your Dark is definitely a bit gimped (although still perfectly playable).
            Are those eternals Six, Okto and Nio?

Honestly I don't really mind doing the grind, I'm in a Tier A and slack and have nothing to really prove, and haven't fully figured out which element I like and want to start really investing into (although based purely on my weapon roster, Dark seems likely). I like completing objectives, so I'll do my best to enjoy the grind and make sure I don't get too burnt out.
                Yes. 

Six is the one you really, really want because he's actually like Dark's best attacker even if you had every gacha option available. 

Okto is Earth's best ougi character but realistically you'll only use him for hosting Diaspora (which is totally optional, you can always just join other people's raids to farm the weps), playing Earth Kengo in SUBHL (which is useful, yes, but you could always play a different element or even just leech it), or coping in high NM GW if you don't have the correct characters for an auto-attack comp. And if you ever get Hrunting, he's basically totally useless.

Nio is a really good buffer and brings Dispel Cancel at 150. But she's pretty interchangable with Ewiyar as far as buffing goes, and Vampy and Naru both have permanent Dispel Cancel anyway so it's debatable how much you really need Dispel Cancel now.
            I don't agree at all that Siete is extremely niche. He's literally a get out of jail free on any V2 raid where you can bring Wind and that is NOT niche. Not when practically all of endgame is V2 raids. Wouldn't lump Sarasa under the niche category either but it's easier to see how you can go without.
                > Not when practically all of endgame is V2 raids.

Neither GW nor bar raids are v2, so no. 

Siete is good in SUBHL at 150. And, sure, you can use him for Belial/Bubz if you want, but those raids are so powercrept that you can use tons of different lineups. Besides that, not much going for him, really. Not the most motivating reason to do a several hundred hour grind.
                    GW and bar raids are not endgame. I don't know what you're smoking to think that. They're still relevant to endgame players but they haven't required a high end team / grid to perform in for a very long time. You can perform perfectly fine in GW without being able to FA NM 150/ NM 200. You don't need the best of the best set ups to bar race. 

The motivating reason to at least grind for Siete 150 is that he can do something no one else can in Wind and with the cost being a much more easily obtained resource than Light's equivalent in Yuni. 

I don't really think you have a leg to stand on when by your own words, the only Eternal worth the transcendence grind is Six. But all he brings is just more damage, in an element with a monstrous roster of damage dealing characters.
        You REALLY need Mystic/Nekomancer for Halo, it lets you wipe out entire waves in a single attack.
            Tweyen and Grimnir also hit all enemies, as do characters like Poseidon or V.Grim who have multihit autos
                Sure but Mystic does it on the very first swing, no waiting.  It adds up when you're grinding thousands of waves
                    what is mystic ?
                        https://gbf.wiki/Mystic
Optimal Hraes bullets. You have both mindless island material grind AND spamming raids that youre a dick if you wanpan
    Yep.

The Steel Liquid quest gave me nightmares, 3 fights for a quest that drop 4 mats. Then there is Bubs filling instantly, people not keeping dispels for 50% or simply healing him.

It even makes farming Replicard seems easy.
        The trick for Bubs pubbing for bullets is to do it *after* you get the gun, honestly. Once he puts up the reflect, call your own bubs and blast the shit out of him before anyone gets the opportunity to ruin the raid. Alternatively, MC can also (barely) survive the reflects with a single Blitz Raid once you reach a certain HP threshold that I can't remember at the moment. I think it was around 60 or 70k? It'll give you new cells to blitz raid too if you had to solo the first ~30%.
        Honestly it’s easier to just solo past a certain point
    Even though I'm nowhere near ready for Primal water it definitely interests me, a shame that the grind is so tough.
I just hate that GBF is making you grind older stuff if you want to uncap or w.e.   Not only that it usually involves a **absurd** quantity with ass droprates.     

Anyways, a lot mentions in the comments and I just agree with them all. Hell, even slime blasting is boring af.

&#x200B;

What I want now is 10x angel halo pro instead of freakin 1.
    Would really glad if we had at least rotational monthly tales of arca boost like the purple chest. 

After flbing an eternal I manage to lv 100 it within 15mins just by doing mundus defender.
Eternal transcendance and Evoker flb are the absolute worst
> I can't imagine what it was like farming for these guys prior to the Tales of Arcarum events

You didn't farm. You did your arcarum tix and really really really prayed hard for the puppets on floors 3 and 6 to be the right element. Otherwise ideans and astras would take you fucking ages.
    Well we did have a lot of time of grinding sandbox before Tales events existed.
Every grind becomes the worst grind with eu ping.
Huanglong and Qilin animas.

Not only do you need a lot of them, *they're pretty inaccessible as people nuke them down real fast.*
    Really glad I finished farming those animas back before powercreep and the new raidfinder made it impossible for westerners to participate in trains or join pubs... I have no idea how people with bad ping are supposed to farm those mats in a reasonable amount of time now. Cygames really needs to boost Huanglong and Qilin's HP or something.
        I wanted to finish my H/Q summons, but with my ping I literally cannot even get a skill in sometimes to at least ougi with Berserker. 

I'll just procrastinate that
            Fortunately they removed blue chests from H/Q raid so you don't need to actually do any damage for good loot drops. But you do need to at least do something, and with my ping and powercreep from new stuff like Ereshkigal I struggle to even semi-auto attack before the raid dies. So joining a train is mostly just an exercise in futility and disappointment as I won't get loot drops from half the runs. And after the new raidfinder was added to the game, I struggle to join pubbed raids before they fill up.
                Full autoing your quick summon registers marginally faster than semi auto. Might make a difference for you in some cases
        Funnily enough, it's so bad that I don't even consider trans a bad grind anymore because it just feels like an RotB time-gate for me now rather than something I can actually grind out. It's still shit, just shit in a different way.
definitely Revans. either the raid is completely dead and fails, or its super active to the point where you cant get the blue chest (and then also still fails
I thought farming astras was bad in arcarum. Until I had to farm for veritas.
    Ideans 💀
    Sheesh, I'm feeling this one while farming for Fraux NWF weapon. It's way worse than Astras in more ways than just one.
        Fr, this is me with Lobelia’s weapon/uncap right now. Having to farm over 700+ veritas for each character is just insanity
            I think this is one of those things where it could depend a lot on what you had access to when you started farming? As someone who started recently enough to mostly farm in Mundus, I think the only way I'd need to farm Veritas is if the World weapon uncaps in December are worth rushing and cost an extremely high amount. I don't think it's *possible* for me to be gated by Veritas more than Astra for NWF/5\*.

For example, just *recruiting* Esta and Katze (and getting the Wind Astral) has put me at... 1152 Temperance and 700 Judgement Veritas. The other elements aren't that high except Dark (840), but for most of the other elements I've not recruited both or even one of the Evokers yet, just upgraded the summons to FLB. (I'm just waiting for the next few Tales runs to recruit their Evokers, since they'll give me enough Astras/stones to grab them and I'd rather farm towards Caim's uncap in the meantime.)
            Not really. Each individual (mainwheel) Veritas is 42% in a Sephira box (in Mundus). That's 1667 boxes to get 700 Veritas, not even counting the ones you'll get from other sources like defenders and The World. And that's enough Veritas for both of that element's evokers, since it's 42% chance for one and 42% chance for the other. You won't even be close to done with ideans or astra in 1667 chests unless you were farming regular Arcarum for years before Sandbox came out or something.
                Yeah my farming for arcarum started way before sandbox was a thing so I’m mostly struggling with the veritas grind right now. Probably because I was used to the stage skipping too
    Don't farm veritas at all. When you finish with ideans you will have twice as many veritas you could ever needed.

EDIT: At least do not buy them
        Yeah, veritas just happen naturally from the sephira chests you get while farming everything else.
            Like what another comment said, it depends, started playing arcanum before sandbox was even a thing so I was farming the ideans and astras with only tickets. Gathering astras really was a pain in the arse
Probably grinding 4 Prom chains to make a, at the time, decent agni grid.
    I remember doing 1900 raids for my 4 CoC, every Prom would melt instantly, and the grid itself was out of the spotlight not too long after
    Spoons when you wanted 3 and the light m 2.5 grid too. Just thousands and thousands of raids
    Honestly one of the major things I'm afraid of as a newer player, especially with M3 around the corner is that a lot of the work I'm putting in now will become obsolete in the immediate future.

But I guess it's always nice to have more options and view it as progression rather than strict meta.
        Don't worry, your progress won't get thrown into the trash when M3 arrives. You will need your M2 or M2.5 grids to work on M3 after all, just like we all had to use our shabby M1 grids as a springboard towards better things one day.
            > You will need your M2 or M2.5 grids to work on M3 after all

You won't really. New players will definitely be able to just totally skip m1 and m2, just like they currently skip m1. It's not like people are sitting there grinding Colossus Omega for 5 Canes nowadays before they start doing m2. You just leech host m2 (in the future, m3) and get weps from the host chests
                I meant this for the current Magna players. Plus, depending on how hard the M3 raids are, you definitely won't be able to just skip M2 all willy nilly. You will likely need at least some pieces of it to farm the next steps, just like you cannot simply farm stuff like Ra with a Colossus Cane grid. You won't need to farm M2 entire gridset, sure, but with Regalia skip coming around, farming the basic pieces becomes easier and almost trivial.
                    > just like you cannot simply farm stuff like Ra with a Colossus Cane grid. 

You literally can though. Host raid, open it up, wait for people to kill it for you, collect weapons.
                        Good luck trying to survive for long enough to at least get blue chests, which is the minimum effort when you are letting others kill the raid for you. I've been in this situation not long ago,and trust me, it isn't a pleasant experience. Plus, albeit M1 does get skipped, it is mainly because it's weapons are really disastrously mid and very few of them have actually useful mods on them. M2 still has very relevant skills that might come into play in specific niches even after M3 release,so you can bet people will still tell you to farm M2 in one way or another. Only thing that changes is that they will move away from the spotlight.
                        Might be different depending on the person but I think of "farm" as joining raids and getting blue chest, not just doing your daily host
                > New players will definitely be able to just totally skip m1 and m2, just like they currently skip m1. It's not like people are sitting there grinding Colossus Omega for 5 Canes nowadays before they start doing m2.

That's because new players get most of an M1 grid fully uncapped for free. Grinding M3 without farming M2 first (until/unless they start giving out free FLB M2 weapons as well) is simply not possible, just like farming M2 without filling the rest of your free M1 grid with at least filler pieces isn't possible. No,hostleeching isn't farming, you could go years without getting drops from only 2-3 shots a day.
                    Doing your 3 hosts per day of m3 + your m1 skip + your m2 skip + getting what blue chests you can once you get a decent grid going is going to get you a grid capable of farming m3 just fine. 

Also this post is 7 months old...
                        You won't get an M1 skip until you can actually solo M1's with ease. You won't get an M2 skip at all (you just host once instead of 3 times ans the requirements are even stricter). Neither of these will help a hew player.
                            Why would they not get an m1 skip? You need to do a 9.6m hp raid. That is not difficult at all with the freebies they give out. Heck, Bubz/250Luci/250Baha will do at least half the raid just just their call damage. If you have Bubz it's completely trivial to just call Bubz t1 then call 250Baha/Luci t2 and the raid's dead.

And they won't get an m2 skip immediately but they'll get one eventually. Literally the only difficult part is the solo kill. You can just leech the 100 kills and 30m damage in one turn is easy enough by saving all your CDs + a big summon call + a 4chain. 

I don't even understand what you're attempting to argue. Players are absolutely not going to need full m2 grids to do m3. You don't even need to get blue chest on m3 raid to get the weps, they're in the new blue-green chest.
    Holy shit. Vietnam war flashbacks fr
As of right now, the grind that is annoying people the most is probably the hunt for sand drops....
Bullets is probably the worst possible grind in my opinion.
    Only reason I don't touch this class even with the mastery.
Everyday grind of gold bricks and sand. At least with all the others you can do it whenever you feel like or when there's an event that motivates you, the only opponent is yourself, now when you include other ppl performance and .1% rates.....
NWF Weapons and the item for transcendence are the worst that comes to mind, everything else you can at your own pace.
    Are those like time-gated in particular, or are they just such substantial grinds that you should be pacing yourself differently?
        Because you can power farm those and the only thing stopping you from getting them is yourself, at least for other stuff you are gated by daily host or using the finder for some time. Doing the 5 diamond mob for countless hours is depressing at best and there is no other way to avoid doing it, the same goes for doing Angel Halo for the stones.
            [deleted]
                Have you tried using the new finder? its basically like its not there, depending on your group or time of the day you barely have time to press a skill, let alone take a turn.
                    [deleted]
                        I only used raidfinder last RotB for Nio and Octo. It was actually pretty smooth post-twitter.
            Yea I'm blasting 5 bars in sandbox as we speak and while it's easy, it's also such mindless busywork. On one hand there's some sort of driving force within me still egging me on to finish it up in the span of ToA, but on the other hand I realize I could probably stretch the grind out before GW.

Hopefully I can pace myself and not get too burnt out lol
                Exactly, with tasks like those its difficult to set a pace at wich you wont end burned out, since you could basically spend all day doing it, there is also the factor of ToA, you can easily fall into the mindset of "I NEED to do this while ToA is going on or Im dumb" and then you procastinate and feel bad about it.

Everything involving Eternals, even the old steps are tedious due to all of the menus you have to go through and all the rusted weapon crap
The most intense grind ever was way back in the day the 2nd rerun of cerb and fenrir after they released fimbul and cerb gun. You had something like 5 days to get 12 of each since back then they were premier weapons for Hades and varuna respectively. The drop rate was so ridiculously low that I once went on a streak of not seeing a single drop in something like 20k AP of hosts with no drops. Cygames would like 2-3 reruns later silently increase the drop rate but those 5 days were hell.

(Note the first run that these weapons were available they were stupid common which really made it a big slap in the face lol)
Trying to break down all the various big grinds over the years and I guess my take is the silver shard grind for Eternal 5* bingo. Just endless hours of Angel Halo spam for a total of 1000 shards. I guess the depths of its monotony can be illustrated in just how many changes to Halo they ended up making over the years to lessen the grind.
Soldier Expert Bullets. I want a Hraes, as water is my main element and I have too many gold moons but the grind seems miserable. So I've been debating in getting it to run a lackluster Soldier, use it with RB only or just either get a Hrunting for Earth or use the moons for damas and build Agni later.

It's quite annoying when Dark can just pick Eresh and use it right away.
Between Arcarum farm and Eternal farm

Your first evoker is immensely painful, especially if you did it before they gave one for free which allows you to get the better farm zone faster.

I'm currently doing Evoker 5* and getting through both 5* NWF weapon, full Domain and then having to kick World more times is absolutely destroying me because the amount of materials you need is absurd. Tales event helps a lot though.

Eternal farm is somewhat doable, until you reach Transc and it gets horrible. Even worse that they force you to get everyone and at some point FLB everyone. Not only getting everyone costs you crystals (for an outdated unit in some cases), it's gated by GW.

I can't stress enough how annoying is that they gate your progress on an Eternal by needing to get and work in everyone else. I only care for 3-4, working on the others will just feel like a chore. At least in Arcarum I'm working towards a character I actually like and also gives me a strong weapon after all the pain, the others just make me suffer for a unit I won't use while draining my crystals and bars
    Where did you farmthe  veritas?
        From chests in all zones and especially defenders in Mundus

I've got so many and I'm done with them already, while I'm not nearly close to finished with Astras and Ideanns farm
I think my opinions on some of the grinds people are mentioning are skewed differently as a newer player. As someone who basically started playing in late December:

Eternal recruitment was relatively easy *because Dread Barrage actually existed once* so I could get most of the weapons in one event. So I was able to get everyone recruited by May GW. The worst part was mostly just me failing to pace out CEQ so I had to run it a ton two nights in a row to get all the required rainbow prisms before it went away. Otherwise I had to farm for some world mats, but nothing that felt that bad?

Eternal FLB/transcending feels way worse, but mostly because of the timegate currently. The materials required for transcending in general obviously is huge but it's hard to even think about it when it's so far away for me, solely due to the weapon fragments? Since I'm boxing NWQ so soon, I'm not exactly stocking up on Revenant weapons, so I can only do an uncap every few GW (unless Dread Barrage happens more often...). The only one I have at 100 is Eahta, since I did way more boxes than expected while getting the last weapons for recruitment at April GW.

I am definitely not being smart about farming materials in advance so there'll be a point where I have to do a ton of AH for orbs and I feel it then. But it'll likely be a good number of months between each time I'd have to do that. And with VS Rising giving a free 100->130 (which I'd use for Seox), the only 100+ I'd be doing myself in the next like... year is Niyon and *maybe* Eahta. Since otherwise it's a long, long time of doing 80->100s so I can unlock 130+.

Then for Evokers, having gotten access to Mundus very soon after unlocking Replicard combined with the Tales events running so frequently has made recruitment not *that* bad? It helps that I went hard on unlocking all the book bonuses, so I have all those to help farm fast and got some passive mats while I did that. And there's definitely still a tedious grind, especially getting astras. But at this point I have most summons at FLB, and am just stone gated on bringing the last couple to that point.

I farmed Caim/Nier/Esta recruitment alongside their Tales, and then farmed Katze during Fraux's; I didn't get a free Evoker since I was already close to getting Caim. The remaining Tales events will hand me enough astras/stones to finish recruiting Geisenborger/Haase/Alanaan, which also just happened for Lobelia, so I'm just lazily waiting for their event shops. Then I'll have to farm a little for Fraux, and MT will depend on how they decide to rerun Tales, and then recruitment will be done.

NWF/Evoker uncaps still definitely feels like a giant grind though! I'm working on Caim's right now and the astra drop rate increasingly isn't fun (and I might get idean gated too by the end). I was at least able to less actively farm by FAing Gil Militis yesterday though, and that was a nice passive gain of them + it gave me an absolute ton of RP to boost me towards some good class EMPs. I need 20 more astra for NWF 2\*/Domain 3 and then hopefully these 400+ boxes I'll open will get me a good chunk towards the 3\*.

But my goal is just to do an uncap or so during each Tales so that I have his 5\* in time to possibly do the World raid in December, and that shouldn't be a problem. NWQ/Evolite/sand will eventually be a gate for doing more of them if I pick up the pace, obviously. But it'll be a long way away at my current rate, especially as transcending summons doesn't seem likely when I have no Lucifer and my Bahamut is 0\*.

And, uh... bullet crafting looks ridiculous but I'm only at 129 GM, and there are multiple weapons I'd get before Hraes so. Maybe I'll find myself there someday. I'm curious. But not soon.
    Interesting read.

Obviously the pace will be different from player to player, but at least it's proof that Cygames' measures to make it easier for new players to catch up are working.
    Late December, means last year? wow, you must be pretty diligently playing the game since then, too bad I'm not paying attention too much to the game back then, just doing my daily omega host every day and it feels tedious, so I neglected to play the game until Late April this year. I wonder how much I can do if I diligently play the game back then, now that pro skip exists, some of the mats have been taken care of which is great IMO. I haven't even done a single element M2 grid though, I've been a little bit unlucky and lucky at the same time for fulfilling the basic grid weapons .
    > started playing in late December

> I'm only at 129 GM

Have you cash sparked like.. a lot? Or bought a starter account maybe? Not trying to shame you or anything just legitimately trying to figure out you could possibly get 129 moons in only 8 months, especially as a new player who's not going to be immediately getting dupes.
        I have gotten some scamchas and suptixes, no directly paid pulls beyond the discounted 300 in March. I started my account during 2022’s anniversary cause of friends talking about free rolls; I had been seeing people tweet about the game for years and years and was curious. So I did the free rolls then, otherwise only played enough to do some side stories to get enough tickets/crystals to finish a spark, and dropped it. Then came back in December and started playing for real during those free rolls. 

So those roulettes last year might account for it? Otherwise it’s just luck one way or the other, I guess.
Sand....

I hate sand. It's my last stop of rage.

It strong enough to leave me change to be seasonal player and not grind anymore.
No one has said it? I'm surprised.

Agonize. I have never been more tempted to bar a farmable weapon than when I was farming my 2 FLB agonizes.

I'm perfectly fine with transcendence and sandbox farming. I've uncapped multiple eternals to 130 and actually never had to spam angel halo since I farm akasha and PBN often for host mats anyway and end up with hundreds of rusted weapons and relic shards. Also do my daily skip and nightmare boss so there's been no issues to me in that regard.

There's been nothing more soul crushing to me in this game than seeing a weapon box in your loot screen after onepunching 200 animus in a row just to get a faceless or a magna fist. It's horrible and it's completely RNG reliant. At least for the other grinds there's a feeling of steady progress - you might need 200 shards but you can see the count going up every day (or just buy 20 per month over multiple months). I was doing hundreds of animus per day and at some point I went over two weeks without a single agonize drop but a bunch of faceless. All my UMs  so far have been maxed out with just animus anima. I never want to farm a weapon in that boss tier again.
    > I was doing hundreds of animus per day and at some point I went over two weeks without a single agonize drop but a bunch of faceless.

Oh god man, that's some unfortunate coin flipping.

The salt in the wound is if you did it today, you'd at least have 2.5 sands to show for your pain. Though I guess that applies to all of us after we've already used up these raids...
    Honestly Agonize is true to it's name: the grind for it brings hell to every part of your body, especially your hands and brain. I really wonder when they will add it to the shop, since now we have all Malice/Menace raids available.
Not sure how the grind is since it's now a free quest, but the worst I remember is grinding Anubis raid for Scales.  That fight is awful, and the drop rate for its weapons were terrible.  Took me almost 4 months of daily hosts before I finally got enough to FLB.
Not the ones that make me say "no way I'm doing that" but those that lure me in looking reasonable.
I finally burned through all of my flawed prisms, so my next 120 eternal might be the last for... awhile. I tried hitting angel halo a bit and really forgot just how awful that is compared to blasting through arcarum mobs. Upside is I have 5 at 110+, and the other 5 aren't particularly interesting.

Second is HQ anima, Six is stuck at 130 until they rerun RotB. Haven't tried punching Revans so I can't speak to that, although I don't know if I'd bother outside of Siette.

Also I just outright refuse to do the bullet grind. Who even needs Hraes.
    Yeah my seox, okto, niyo, and threo are all stuck at 130 cause getting HQ anima is awful
        I can 100% say that trying to join hq lobbies from the raid finder isn't fun
            Yup I've tried it a few times the last couple of weeks and it's miserable
Im thinking it’s full eternals transcendence. I didn’t know but you have to FLB all for one to get to 150. That’s 440 GW boxes. Absolutely insane.

I thought evokers FLB was also mind numbingly bad and it used a lot of pots surprisingly. It’s not a thing I want to go through again. Also, seeing some of these FLB, they don’t seem really all that worth it. Im kinda regretting that I went through all the effort for something that is somewhat mid.
Honestly im in the phase of Evoker FLB and Trans Eternals Lv130-140 uncap as this really sucks. 

My 1st issue being RoTB Raids and the Quilin raids being so time gated and the HQHL raids die in less then 30 seconds.

And or finding parties for SubBaha grind for progression to ULB Ultima can also be hit or miss.
Since even with a rank 225 and have a fully whale grid with execution role its like you need to find the parties willing to teach on discord or your crew exclusively. OR solo challenge it. 

Really its EndGamePlayerProblems 

But coming from as a new player in like 2017. The first Eternals with story mats was horrible.
    > And or finding parties for SubBaha grind for progression to ULB Ultima can also be hit or miss. Since even with a rank 225 and have a fully whale grid with execution role its like you need to find the parties willing to teach on discord or your crew exclusively. OR solo challenge it. 

Just go in coop? My rooms fill up in less than 5 minutes.
        I meant joining for the grind. But coop is an option if you host is not that bad at certain times for carries.
Somewhere between your recruiting your first Evoker / Eternal to uncapping your first Evoker. The first recruitment is rough, especially evoker if you're newer to the game but Eternals are also locked behind GW so those are a toss up. Uncapping an Evoker is objectively several times more arduous than recruiting but once you're used to the flow and have solid grids, it ends up not that much more intense than getting your first eternal ~ rank 100
HQL anima is one of the dumbest mats for 140 eternal uncap. If you don't hard farm it during the week/week after rotb it's a graveyard. Also just the actual farming of it sucks, bosses have too little hp for a 30 man raid.
I really think Angel halo. At least with sandbox grinding (probably the second worst) you can grind out exp and the like too. AH is just mind numbing and you don’t really get that. The sheer amount you have to do for your first transcendence is truly brutal.
Low orbs for eternal transcendence
Eternal FLB bingo and FLB Evoker come to mind sometimes.

At times I wish the Elemental Trials didn't drop Scrolls and Scales in idiotically low drips. Sure, you can trade 100 tomes for some, but like, why? 

Also, PBN really loves giving away rusted guns at times, and yeah, obligatory Flawed Prism slander as well.
Haven’t actually uncapped Nier yet and she’ll be my first Evoker to do that to, but getting the materials to get Seofon to 100 just felt more… *obnoxious*? On account of how the game’s UI is so janky. I actually had everything I needed before I even realized it because there’s so many steps and going through menus and upgrading and changing weapons to go through.

With Evokers, it’s just “get a lot of things” mostly.

I can honestly deal with a longer grind if it’s simpler to put everything together.
Kind of a new player here (?), my rank is 145, started around December last year but actively playing in Late April, only doing for free pulls. M2 grind is tedious, sometimes the drop rates don't give you the weapon you want, but I learned that grinding your first (not free) The Eternal is harder than the M2 weapon, especially the yellow orbs and blue crystals. 

So, I think my goal right now is finishing a lot of side stories and getting some of the goodies there. My "The Hanged Man" summon is only 1 step away from recruiting Caim before I get time-gated on the Sephira evolite, after that, when the event ".... And You" rerun, I don't know whether I should choose the NWF weapon or getting the other Evoker, I kind of leaning towards to the first one, since uncapping the arcarum summons doesn't seem like a tedious one. My "Sword" revenant weapon is only 2 steps away from completion.
Everything that's why it's hell lol
Angel Halo, and to be specific, fucking Flawed Prisms. 

For reasons God only knows, you need more or less 15,000 for EACH Juuten from recruit to 120 uncap until you escape Prism hell for that Juuten alone. I know you can ease the grind by reducing SR summons and buying from shops but the sheer quantity you need is just ridiculous.
Just two words:

Fuck Mugen.
FLB Evoker is some sort of Cygames' way to push you into seeking immortality. 

Because you hardly can finish that before you die...
Farming Qilin and Huanlong animas to uncap eternals, the raid is almost unavailable to someone with my south American ping. When going in coop is almost a miracle to hit once... I'm so glad I already finished that grind for all my eternals but Anre, he will sit in 120 for a long time
Sticky Shell II
Angel halo
As a newbie : yes
Astra isn't that bad..
Arcanum fragments is magnitude worae.
for me.back then M2 weapon grind, ping really make it impossible to get minimum score for blue chest :(
Most "top of the line" stuff of its time always involves really heavy grind, and over time the grind gate gets loosened over time. Even evokers seem trivial now with massive Tales stacking, but it is still repetitive. 

Worst one right now is definitely bullet Hraes grind (I hated the SUBHL part the most actually since I can't do the funny executes or 5-8 turn rooms) and Eternal Sand for Baha Luci and the evokers FLB, since they're fairly new.
Sands. Like I get it, the drop rate has to be low but GOD DAMN
Fediel’s raid. Have fun farming for spines when you can’t heal after 40% and people generally don’t join if the boss is lower than 70% health
So definitely not the most hated bit from reading these comments, but FLBing Eternals *without using an extra gold brick* for me.

Partially upgrading and reducing hordes of weapons with our rather clunky interface drove me mad. So mad I only did it once.

Conversely I have Evoker bingo and that felt like it did itself over time, the weapon uncaps are another story alas.....
Aganize
Opening up like 4~5 windows to speed up changing rusted weapon elements/leveling/skill up
Sandclock farming nondoubt
More RNG prob but farming Gold Bar, salt meter throu the roof when comparin to crewmates
To hell with HL/QL omega animas.
Almost every big grind they added "recently" (Transcendance, NWF Weapons/FLB Evokers especially) are a PITA, since they are a huge material sink, and were at first made for veteran who already have a ton of leftover mats, but if you're not a veteran and you get to that point, you're stuck in a grind that never ends

Honestly the progress back in magna 2 felt much better (Ennead was nice too imo)
Angel fucking Halo…
When I was a newer at gbf? Recruiting my first Evoker. That shit actually had me raging for awhile because collecting 200 Astras felt like a slap in the face when I finally finished the arcarum summon.

Now? Anything that involves sands. I went nearly 5 months without seeing an eternity sand drop to the point I wasn’t even sure if they actually existed and this was a huge hoax.
Blue skin is most likely the objectively hardest grind because of the pure amount of resources, but from my experience definitely the first eternal uncap. After the first one you basically get a lot of the materials for the rest. Shout-out to eternal Transcendence having you to flb them all
    It's actually pretty easy since it's just boxing Revvin' Weapons again, so you're looking at the Light Scrolls / Flawed Prisms gate (especially the former, with 100 per month in Shop it'd take 50 months to have enough and Light Trial drop them two by two). Same thing with Splendor Weapons just that you got to hit a bunch of Akasha as well.

Huanglong and Qilin animas are a bit ass I guess, but the hard part (and real issue) is what you can not farm : Sunstones. And 4 of them.
4LB Eternals. I’ve ‘played’ since 2014, unlocked every Eternal and Evoker. Nothing brings me less joy than the idea of 4LB Eternals and I’ve never/will never do it.
    You mean getting them to 4*? Or stage 4 of transcendence?
        Just 4* in general. I just don’t care. Fuck transcending them as well.
            4* isn't hard, don't really see the issue. Gotta play GW for the other rewards anyway.
                There isn’t. I just don’t care enough. I used to be in a top tier JP guild when I lived there between 16-17, and barely bother with GW since then in a retirement guild.
Revans weapons. I miss the days when endgame raids were relatively one-and-done things like Opus (only occasionally do it again to change keys). I'm all for challenging content, but not when it should be farmed over and over and over again, and with real failure chances too (not allowing elixir).

"but if it's one-and-done they'll become dead raids soon!"

Then ***let them die***. If newer players need help they can always ask for it. You don't have to make a game that enslaves its players to make money, a bunch of games have proved that it's possible to not have a stupid grind and still make major financial success.
    Revans is honestly not as bad compared to long time ago when T1 HLs/Epics are 6 man and you have to farm them for urns, and they aren't one-and-done either. You need to literally coordinate among each other especially Medusa back then when reflect can kill the entire run. At least in dead Revans raids like Mugen you can practically end up carrying IMO
    >Then let them die. If newer players need help they can always ask for it.

I think the problem is that you can't always expect new players to know someone in the community to help. A lot of Granblue's recent steps have been to try and wean off needing outside sources to understand the game, including making a lot of dead raids solo battles, so I get that they wouldn't WANT said raids to die.
Evokers and i will not hear anything else.
Bars. Raids are so boring now and there's no alternative.

Every other grind has an end point, sands are easy to farm, everything else is just mindless 0 button spamming.
grid irl to whale in this game  
it will never enough if you want everything
still think after all the time i've spent playing this game i'd rather re grind all my eternals all over again, then continue to sit through arcarum. But yeah naww probably just arcarum is the worst grind if you had to ask.
fuck sandbox, I can't do it
At one time, I thought getting 4 copies of every magna summon was a slog.
I thinks bullets for rainbows john doe. Below that angel halo was the most tedious for me.
Guider to the Eternal Edge skin.

30000 Light Whorls.
SBHL bullets for soldiers has to be up there in terms of quantity

Angel Halo does take the cake for the most boring grind possible
Sometimes I wonder if someone build fga like for gbf for the tedious grindd considering already build that cheat rais joiner before.
Farming pots in coop is the worst grind imo
bullet farming is basically the definition of insanity
Well, my personal take: the idean farm for evoker 5 star uncap.
First I thought it's J10 Transcendence but Evokers FLB is something else... it's a pain and in many cases not worth it.
A FUCKING GOLD BRICK
Sand/gb grinding..
I have certain things I want to mention here, but highly likely I'll be downvoted because it may seem I play the game differently from everyone else.

Anyway, for me it's the weekly Join 50 Raids Skyscope missions. During weeks without events that require to join raids, this is a pain to complete, because I hate slogging through someone else's raids. I mainly farm stuff by relying on hosting and I don't join raids so this is why this is annoying to complete.
What's a seasonal player?
    Back for Summer and Xmas/New years freebies, and depending on where on the scale you are, maybe checking out some events here and there
It's also a veteran check to progress past 110 anyway since you need all 10 of them recruited.
    Recruiting is easier after the first one imo. Uncapping is the real hurdle.
        Takes time and gold bars, which you are sort of naturally gated on if you're new.

You're neither farming them nor drowning in giveaways in a short period of time.
            The gold bar gate is very miniscule because you get so many gold bars from Rise of the Beasts if you're new
            It depends on how how often RotB is running (and how quickly you ranked up since that gates Shenxian), I guess. I was able to get the gold bricks without much trouble that way.
        I may be behind on what grinds exist, but it feels like nothing else is as much of a light whorl, scroll, and dragon seed drain as uncapping the Eternals. At worst, you're looking at element changing 109 weapons because you can get one Eternal for free. 

It's definitely easy and brainless once you acquire enough dark units with passive TA to semi-auto the entire process, but you still need to sit there as you get stupid amounts of light mats you don't burn as quickly through from simply uncapping light characters.
    I mean.. I recruited them all before I got my first to 100.
        It's not a question of possibility. It's just that if you're doing it for meta reasons (e.g. Song at 110 real good, Siete 130, etc), or you just really like one of them and want to focus on them, it's not an option, you still need them all.
It's nothing in comparision to Evoker's FLB :(
This is basically what happened to me. I didn't quite go seasonal right away but then more and more V2 fights started coming out with increasing roster/ grid requirements and I just don't care anymore. More and more high end raids with less and less motivation to do them because the entry power level required keeps climbing faster than I care to gain power.
if you have a character like grimnir (or v.grimnir) you can use him instead of neko
Definitely can vouch for the later two, but this is my 3rd evoker (granted I got one for free), and I'm still definitely feeling the grind. Does anything in particular change after your first Evoker or is it just being used to the grind?
    You "accidentally" get mats you didnt want while grinding first one that you can use on 2nd one and etc etc
    Guess it is the latter. At one point your body just gets used to it. But ngl, having access to Here be Swords zone helps a lot, Staves doesn't contribute with almost nothing towards your progress with their unlocks.

I have five Evokers unlocked,one of which was free(Caim was the free one, unlocked Alanaan, Haaselia, Fraux and Lobelia by myself) and the process is way too long and tiresome if you only tunnelvision your progress towards it. I prefer to do other stuff in the meantime that happens to get me the materials for progression as well, and then I go back and finish the deed.

Now, for NWF weapons it's an entirely different situation...
        I honestly rushed Mundus because I heard the nodes there gives the most bang for your buck in a way. Took a bit of effort to get a 0b setup working but it was worth it, but getting only around 10 Astras per 100 chests and maybe 10-20 residually has definitely been tedious.

But yeah at least it's a grind I don't have to put much thought into, I can see myself getting used to this.
            You really should do more normal arcarum.

Normal arcarum gives more astras and ideans.
            Sounds like a dangerous mindset to get into
    You get used to the grind and your grind for the first evoker has brought in tons of materials for your next one; So long as you aren't deliberately aiming for the same elements back to back, there's less of a buffer each time depending on what sort of route you take to get all of them.

Along with your Sandbox grinding, which helps a ton for some specific mats. Sephira Stone gating suuuuuucks.
        For real. I tried unlocking two Fire Evokers in close proximity(Alanaan in March, Fraux last month) and as a result I ran out of Verums and Astras to use for uncapping Kiss of the Devil properly. I managed to solve the Astra issue after a while but farming Verums kind of sucks.
    No one is mentioning this because this community is very weird about it. But the fastest way to get evokers is to trade new world quartz for the tedious mats and let yourself be gated by straightforward things like ideans.

Ideans largely just require 9 arcarum tickets to get 4 or so from killing the boss. Astras are almost completely random. Use new world quartz to make astras to supplement whatever you're lacking when you have all of the other mats.

With this in mind, the fastest way to unlock all evokers (and the method I used) is to unlock all of the eternals so you can start getting quartz from boxes during gw. I guarantee you you will always have more than you could ever reasonably use.

At this point I have 10/10 evokers and I have Caim FLB. Lobelia is almost ready, just need to do one more domain and get a sands drop for his last weapon uncap. And all of my other NWF weapons are at least 3 stars just missing a couple of things to finish them off.

I also have 10/10 eternals with all of them FLB and 6 of them at at least 110. Eternals uncaps get WAY easier after the first one and daily angel halo pro makes it far more chill.

My approach to grinding is marathon most of it and only sprint the last 10% or so. Trading resources is always useful because you will almost always have a surplus of *something* you can trade. And if you don't have a surplus then daily host until you do.
        No one mentions it because new world quartz is an extremely limited and time-gated item. Beyond the one-time rewards from missions and tower of babyl and the ones in the shop that are never restocked, the only way to acquire more is from Tales of Arcarum and Unite and Fight events. If you trade your NWQ for farmable mats that might come back to bite you in the ass later when you need tons of them to FLB uncap your evokers and unlock their 4th skills. You need 1,200 NWQ total if you intend to collect and fully power up every evoker.
            I'm aware of this.

However if you grind the evokers slowly over time you are absolutely not being gated by NWQ there are enough consistent sources of it that you won't hit this wall before you hit other much larger walls
                I guess that's true if you farm sandbox slowly enough. But recently with regular Tales of Arcarum events massively accelerating the efficiency of farming sandbox, a sufficiently motivated player could easily hit the NWQ wall pretty fast.


I've personally reached the point where the only things preventing me from ULB uncapping all my NWF weapons + FLB uncapping every Eternal and unlocking their 4th skills is being gated by NWQ, eternity sand and sunstones. I've finished farming every other required material.
                GW is the most significant source of NWQ in the game at the moment, and I've finally started actually doing GW for nearly two years now. I also obtained all the other sources of NWQ (Tower, Tales, etc).

I have only about ~700 life time NWQ. And let me tell you, the time spent getting NWQ from GW to trade in for arcarum mats is much better spent on on actually farming those mats directly.
                    I mean this is anecdotal and meaningless as my experience is directly counter to yours.

Same time frame and I have every single evoker and still have a surplus of NWQ and that's while taking detours to 40 box eternals for transcendence.

It all relies on the rate at which you focus farm the mats. Trading the mats down when you need a push to get over the line requires you to understand your resources. It's the same as when people say "if you gotta ask if you need this gold moon weapon then you're not ready for it". I wouldn't blindly tell people to trade NWQ down to 0 to rush something I am saying if you have 300 NWQ and 0 evokers you are nor burning through 300 NWQ in 2 months. You can afford to trade 20 down to speed up the final step.
                        Honestly this is also a valid take. For you do to it you actually need to understand how much you value your time(and sanity) in this situation, and I wouldn't blame someone for trading a few NWQs for those final pesky Astras you need for the unlock. However, you must also shoulder the responsibility that once you spend those, your life during NWF grind might become harder, so that's the main reason why it is not a recommended approach: you cannot expect everyone to have these levels of discernment for this decision.
The last Eternal is way worse because you ran out of Rainbow Prisms ages ago and have already been farming it for the last few you got
Definitely not looking forward to it, especially when I hear how much most of the eternals are only viable at certain levels. Hadn't even considered mult-wave content, that genuinely sounds miserable lol

At the same time though, I guess I've gotten addicted to the cycle of destroying my posture and mental just to be rewarded by numbers going up. Need to pace myself so I don't get burnt out lmao
    Good luck, I burnt out and took around a year off thanks to transcendence and GW grinds. Now I'm just going at a pace I'm comfortable with instead of trying to rush things.
        Yeah I took a break for like 3 months because of evoker flb, eternal transcend and last year's Halloween banner.

Then I realized I was being absurd trying to force myself to keep up with youtubers. Now I let other people do the work for me and I just copy them slowly over the course of 6 months.

Just because something is no longer the fastest comp doesn't mean it can't kill something I just need to collect the pieces.
    It's very debatable if Eternals are even worth the time doing in 2023 tbh. There's only 1 Eternal that you actually really, really want. Of the rest, 2 are fine, but you can easily go without, and then the other 7 range from extremely niche to outright useless. Most badly need additional transcendence levels to be relevant, but that's years away, if it ever happens at all. If you *really* didn't want to do the Eternals grind, you can honestly just ignore them and accumulate stuff from your daily AH Pro, with the only cost being that your Dark is definitely a bit gimped (although still perfectly playable).
        Are those eternals Six, Okto and Nio?

Honestly I don't really mind doing the grind, I'm in a Tier A and slack and have nothing to really prove, and haven't fully figured out which element I like and want to start really investing into (although based purely on my weapon roster, Dark seems likely). I like completing objectives, so I'll do my best to enjoy the grind and make sure I don't get too burnt out.
            Yes. 

Six is the one you really, really want because he's actually like Dark's best attacker even if you had every gacha option available. 

Okto is Earth's best ougi character but realistically you'll only use him for hosting Diaspora (which is totally optional, you can always just join other people's raids to farm the weps), playing Earth Kengo in SUBHL (which is useful, yes, but you could always play a different element or even just leech it), or coping in high NM GW if you don't have the correct characters for an auto-attack comp. And if you ever get Hrunting, he's basically totally useless.

Nio is a really good buffer and brings Dispel Cancel at 150. But she's pretty interchangable with Ewiyar as far as buffing goes, and Vampy and Naru both have permanent Dispel Cancel anyway so it's debatable how much you really need Dispel Cancel now.
        I don't agree at all that Siete is extremely niche. He's literally a get out of jail free on any V2 raid where you can bring Wind and that is NOT niche. Not when practically all of endgame is V2 raids. Wouldn't lump Sarasa under the niche category either but it's easier to see how you can go without.
            > Not when practically all of endgame is V2 raids.

Neither GW nor bar raids are v2, so no. 

Siete is good in SUBHL at 150. And, sure, you can use him for Belial/Bubz if you want, but those raids are so powercrept that you can use tons of different lineups. Besides that, not much going for him, really. Not the most motivating reason to do a several hundred hour grind.
                GW and bar raids are not endgame. I don't know what you're smoking to think that. They're still relevant to endgame players but they haven't required a high end team / grid to perform in for a very long time. You can perform perfectly fine in GW without being able to FA NM 150/ NM 200. You don't need the best of the best set ups to bar race. 

The motivating reason to at least grind for Siete 150 is that he can do something no one else can in Wind and with the cost being a much more easily obtained resource than Light's equivalent in Yuni. 

I don't really think you have a leg to stand on when by your own words, the only Eternal worth the transcendence grind is Six. But all he brings is just more damage, in an element with a monstrous roster of damage dealing characters.
    You REALLY need Mystic/Nekomancer for Halo, it lets you wipe out entire waves in a single attack.
        Tweyen and Grimnir also hit all enemies, as do characters like Poseidon or V.Grim who have multihit autos
            Sure but Mystic does it on the very first swing, no waiting.  It adds up when you're grinding thousands of waves
                what is mystic ?
                    https://gbf.wiki/Mystic
Yep.

The Steel Liquid quest gave me nightmares, 3 fights for a quest that drop 4 mats. Then there is Bubs filling instantly, people not keeping dispels for 50% or simply healing him.

It even makes farming Replicard seems easy.
    The trick for Bubs pubbing for bullets is to do it *after* you get the gun, honestly. Once he puts up the reflect, call your own bubs and blast the shit out of him before anyone gets the opportunity to ruin the raid. Alternatively, MC can also (barely) survive the reflects with a single Blitz Raid once you reach a certain HP threshold that I can't remember at the moment. I think it was around 60 or 70k? It'll give you new cells to blitz raid too if you had to solo the first ~30%.
    Honestly it’s easier to just solo past a certain point
Even though I'm nowhere near ready for Primal water it definitely interests me, a shame that the grind is so tough.
Would really glad if we had at least rotational monthly tales of arca boost like the purple chest. 

After flbing an eternal I manage to lv 100 it within 15mins just by doing mundus defender.
Well we did have a lot of time of grinding sandbox before Tales events existed.
Really glad I finished farming those animas back before powercreep and the new raidfinder made it impossible for westerners to participate in trains or join pubs... I have no idea how people with bad ping are supposed to farm those mats in a reasonable amount of time now. Cygames really needs to boost Huanglong and Qilin's HP or something.
    I wanted to finish my H/Q summons, but with my ping I literally cannot even get a skill in sometimes to at least ougi with Berserker. 

I'll just procrastinate that
        Fortunately they removed blue chests from H/Q raid so you don't need to actually do any damage for good loot drops. But you do need to at least do something, and with my ping and powercreep from new stuff like Ereshkigal I struggle to even semi-auto attack before the raid dies. So joining a train is mostly just an exercise in futility and disappointment as I won't get loot drops from half the runs. And after the new raidfinder was added to the game, I struggle to join pubbed raids before they fill up.
            Full autoing your quick summon registers marginally faster than semi auto. Might make a difference for you in some cases
    Funnily enough, it's so bad that I don't even consider trans a bad grind anymore because it just feels like an RotB time-gate for me now rather than something I can actually grind out. It's still shit, just shit in a different way.
Ideans 💀
Sheesh, I'm feeling this one while farming for Fraux NWF weapon. It's way worse than Astras in more ways than just one.
    Fr, this is me with Lobelia’s weapon/uncap right now. Having to farm over 700+ veritas for each character is just insanity
        I think this is one of those things where it could depend a lot on what you had access to when you started farming? As someone who started recently enough to mostly farm in Mundus, I think the only way I'd need to farm Veritas is if the World weapon uncaps in December are worth rushing and cost an extremely high amount. I don't think it's *possible* for me to be gated by Veritas more than Astra for NWF/5\*.

For example, just *recruiting* Esta and Katze (and getting the Wind Astral) has put me at... 1152 Temperance and 700 Judgement Veritas. The other elements aren't that high except Dark (840), but for most of the other elements I've not recruited both or even one of the Evokers yet, just upgraded the summons to FLB. (I'm just waiting for the next few Tales runs to recruit their Evokers, since they'll give me enough Astras/stones to grab them and I'd rather farm towards Caim's uncap in the meantime.)
        Not really. Each individual (mainwheel) Veritas is 42% in a Sephira box (in Mundus). That's 1667 boxes to get 700 Veritas, not even counting the ones you'll get from other sources like defenders and The World. And that's enough Veritas for both of that element's evokers, since it's 42% chance for one and 42% chance for the other. You won't even be close to done with ideans or astra in 1667 chests unless you were farming regular Arcarum for years before Sandbox came out or something.
            Yeah my farming for arcarum started way before sandbox was a thing so I’m mostly struggling with the veritas grind right now. Probably because I was used to the stage skipping too
Don't farm veritas at all. When you finish with ideans you will have twice as many veritas you could ever needed.

EDIT: At least do not buy them
    Yeah, veritas just happen naturally from the sephira chests you get while farming everything else.
        Like what another comment said, it depends, started playing arcanum before sandbox was even a thing so I was farming the ideans and astras with only tickets. Gathering astras really was a pain in the arse
I remember doing 1900 raids for my 4 CoC, every Prom would melt instantly, and the grid itself was out of the spotlight not too long after
Spoons when you wanted 3 and the light m 2.5 grid too. Just thousands and thousands of raids
Honestly one of the major things I'm afraid of as a newer player, especially with M3 around the corner is that a lot of the work I'm putting in now will become obsolete in the immediate future.

But I guess it's always nice to have more options and view it as progression rather than strict meta.
    Don't worry, your progress won't get thrown into the trash when M3 arrives. You will need your M2 or M2.5 grids to work on M3 after all, just like we all had to use our shabby M1 grids as a springboard towards better things one day.
        > You will need your M2 or M2.5 grids to work on M3 after all

You won't really. New players will definitely be able to just totally skip m1 and m2, just like they currently skip m1. It's not like people are sitting there grinding Colossus Omega for 5 Canes nowadays before they start doing m2. You just leech host m2 (in the future, m3) and get weps from the host chests
            I meant this for the current Magna players. Plus, depending on how hard the M3 raids are, you definitely won't be able to just skip M2 all willy nilly. You will likely need at least some pieces of it to farm the next steps, just like you cannot simply farm stuff like Ra with a Colossus Cane grid. You won't need to farm M2 entire gridset, sure, but with Regalia skip coming around, farming the basic pieces becomes easier and almost trivial.
                > just like you cannot simply farm stuff like Ra with a Colossus Cane grid. 

You literally can though. Host raid, open it up, wait for people to kill it for you, collect weapons.
                    Good luck trying to survive for long enough to at least get blue chests, which is the minimum effort when you are letting others kill the raid for you. I've been in this situation not long ago,and trust me, it isn't a pleasant experience. Plus, albeit M1 does get skipped, it is mainly because it's weapons are really disastrously mid and very few of them have actually useful mods on them. M2 still has very relevant skills that might come into play in specific niches even after M3 release,so you can bet people will still tell you to farm M2 in one way or another. Only thing that changes is that they will move away from the spotlight.
                    Might be different depending on the person but I think of "farm" as joining raids and getting blue chest, not just doing your daily host
            > New players will definitely be able to just totally skip m1 and m2, just like they currently skip m1. It's not like people are sitting there grinding Colossus Omega for 5 Canes nowadays before they start doing m2.

That's because new players get most of an M1 grid fully uncapped for free. Grinding M3 without farming M2 first (until/unless they start giving out free FLB M2 weapons as well) is simply not possible, just like farming M2 without filling the rest of your free M1 grid with at least filler pieces isn't possible. No,hostleeching isn't farming, you could go years without getting drops from only 2-3 shots a day.
                Doing your 3 hosts per day of m3 + your m1 skip + your m2 skip + getting what blue chests you can once you get a decent grid going is going to get you a grid capable of farming m3 just fine. 

Also this post is 7 months old...
                    You won't get an M1 skip until you can actually solo M1's with ease. You won't get an M2 skip at all (you just host once instead of 3 times ans the requirements are even stricter). Neither of these will help a hew player.
                        Why would they not get an m1 skip? You need to do a 9.6m hp raid. That is not difficult at all with the freebies they give out. Heck, Bubz/250Luci/250Baha will do at least half the raid just just their call damage. If you have Bubz it's completely trivial to just call Bubz t1 then call 250Baha/Luci t2 and the raid's dead.

And they won't get an m2 skip immediately but they'll get one eventually. Literally the only difficult part is the solo kill. You can just leech the 100 kills and 30m damage in one turn is easy enough by saving all your CDs + a big summon call + a 4chain. 

I don't even understand what you're attempting to argue. Players are absolutely not going to need full m2 grids to do m3. You don't even need to get blue chest on m3 raid to get the weps, they're in the new blue-green chest.
Holy shit. Vietnam war flashbacks fr
Only reason I don't touch this class even with the mastery.
Are those like time-gated in particular, or are they just such substantial grinds that you should be pacing yourself differently?
    Because you can power farm those and the only thing stopping you from getting them is yourself, at least for other stuff you are gated by daily host or using the finder for some time. Doing the 5 diamond mob for countless hours is depressing at best and there is no other way to avoid doing it, the same goes for doing Angel Halo for the stones.
        [deleted]
            Have you tried using the new finder? its basically like its not there, depending on your group or time of the day you barely have time to press a skill, let alone take a turn.
                [deleted]
                    I only used raidfinder last RotB for Nio and Octo. It was actually pretty smooth post-twitter.
        Yea I'm blasting 5 bars in sandbox as we speak and while it's easy, it's also such mindless busywork. On one hand there's some sort of driving force within me still egging me on to finish it up in the span of ToA, but on the other hand I realize I could probably stretch the grind out before GW.

Hopefully I can pace myself and not get too burnt out lol
            Exactly, with tasks like those its difficult to set a pace at wich you wont end burned out, since you could basically spend all day doing it, there is also the factor of ToA, you can easily fall into the mindset of "I NEED to do this while ToA is going on or Im dumb" and then you procastinate and feel bad about it.   


Source: me
Where did you farmthe  veritas?
    From chests in all zones and especially defenders in Mundus

I've got so many and I'm done with them already, while I'm not nearly close to finished with Astras and Ideanns farm
Interesting read.

Obviously the pace will be different from player to player, but at least it's proof that Cygames' measures to make it easier for new players to catch up are working.
Late December, means last year? wow, you must be pretty diligently playing the game since then, too bad I'm not paying attention too much to the game back then, just doing my daily omega host every day and it feels tedious, so I neglected to play the game until Late April this year. I wonder how much I can do if I diligently play the game back then, now that pro skip exists, some of the mats have been taken care of which is great IMO. I haven't even done a single element M2 grid though, I've been a little bit unlucky and lucky at the same time for fulfilling the basic grid weapons .
> started playing in late December

> I'm only at 129 GM

Have you cash sparked like.. a lot? Or bought a starter account maybe? Not trying to shame you or anything just legitimately trying to figure out you could possibly get 129 moons in only 8 months, especially as a new player who's not going to be immediately getting dupes.
    I have gotten some scamchas and suptixes, no directly paid pulls beyond the discounted 300 in March. I started my account during 2022’s anniversary cause of friends talking about free rolls; I had been seeing people tweet about the game for years and years and was curious. So I did the free rolls then, otherwise only played enough to do some side stories to get enough tickets/crystals to finish a spark, and dropped it. Then came back in December and started playing for real during those free rolls. 

So those roulettes last year might account for it? Otherwise it’s just luck one way or the other, I guess.
> I was doing hundreds of animus per day and at some point I went over two weeks without a single agonize drop but a bunch of faceless.

Oh god man, that's some unfortunate coin flipping.

The salt in the wound is if you did it today, you'd at least have 2.5 sands to show for your pain. Though I guess that applies to all of us after we've already used up these raids...
Honestly Agonize is true to it's name: the grind for it brings hell to every part of your body, especially your hands and brain. I really wonder when they will add it to the shop, since now we have all Malice/Menace raids available.
Yeah my seox, okto, niyo, and threo are all stuck at 130 cause getting HQ anima is awful
    I can 100% say that trying to join hq lobbies from the raid finder isn't fun
        Yup I've tried it a few times the last couple of weeks and it's miserable
> And or finding parties for SubBaha grind for progression to ULB Ultima can also be hit or miss. Since even with a rank 225 and have a fully whale grid with execution role its like you need to find the parties willing to teach on discord or your crew exclusively. OR solo challenge it. 

Just go in coop? My rooms fill up in less than 5 minutes.
    I meant joining for the grind. But coop is an option if you host is not that bad at certain times for carries.
It's actually pretty easy since it's just boxing Revvin' Weapons again, so you're looking at the Light Scrolls / Flawed Prisms gate (especially the former, with 100 per month in Shop it'd take 50 months to have enough and Light Trial drop them two by two). Same thing with Splendor Weapons just that you got to hit a bunch of Akasha as well.

Huanglong and Qilin animas are a bit ass I guess, but the hard part (and real issue) is what you can not farm : Sunstones. And 4 of them.
You mean getting them to 4*? Or stage 4 of transcendence?
    Just 4* in general. I just don’t care. Fuck transcending them as well.
        4* isn't hard, don't really see the issue. Gotta play GW for the other rewards anyway.
            There isn’t. I just don’t care enough. I used to be in a top tier JP guild when I lived there between 16-17, and barely bother with GW since then in a retirement guild.
Revans is honestly not as bad compared to long time ago when T1 HLs/Epics are 6 man and you have to farm them for urns, and they aren't one-and-done either. You need to literally coordinate among each other especially Medusa back then when reflect can kill the entire run. At least in dead Revans raids like Mugen you can practically end up carrying IMO
>Then let them die. If newer players need help they can always ask for it.

I think the problem is that you can't always expect new players to know someone in the community to help. A lot of Granblue's recent steps have been to try and wean off needing outside sources to understand the game, including making a lot of dead raids solo battles, so I get that they wouldn't WANT said raids to die.
Back for Summer and Xmas/New years freebies, and depending on where on the scale you are, maybe checking out some events here and there
Recruiting is easier after the first one imo. Uncapping is the real hurdle.
    Takes time and gold bars, which you are sort of naturally gated on if you're new.

You're neither farming them nor drowning in giveaways in a short period of time.
        The gold bar gate is very miniscule because you get so many gold bars from Rise of the Beasts if you're new
        It depends on how how often RotB is running (and how quickly you ranked up since that gates Shenxian), I guess. I was able to get the gold bricks without much trouble that way.
    I may be behind on what grinds exist, but it feels like nothing else is as much of a light whorl, scroll, and dragon seed drain as uncapping the Eternals. At worst, you're looking at element changing 109 weapons because you can get one Eternal for free. 

It's definitely easy and brainless once you acquire enough dark units with passive TA to semi-auto the entire process, but you still need to sit there as you get stupid amounts of light mats you don't burn as quickly through from simply uncapping light characters.
I mean.. I recruited them all before I got my first to 100.
    It's not a question of possibility. It's just that if you're doing it for meta reasons (e.g. Song at 110 real good, Siete 130, etc), or you just really like one of them and want to focus on them, it's not an option, you still need them all.
You "accidentally" get mats you didnt want while grinding first one that you can use on 2nd one and etc etc
Guess it is the latter. At one point your body just gets used to it. But ngl, having access to Here be Swords zone helps a lot, Staves doesn't contribute with almost nothing towards your progress with their unlocks.

I have five Evokers unlocked,one of which was free(Caim was the free one, unlocked Alanaan, Haaselia, Fraux and Lobelia by myself) and the process is way too long and tiresome if you only tunnelvision your progress towards it. I prefer to do other stuff in the meantime that happens to get me the materials for progression as well, and then I go back and finish the deed.

Now, for NWF weapons it's an entirely different situation...
    I honestly rushed Mundus because I heard the nodes there gives the most bang for your buck in a way. Took a bit of effort to get a 0b setup working but it was worth it, but getting only around 10 Astras per 100 chests and maybe 10-20 residually has definitely been tedious.

But yeah at least it's a grind I don't have to put much thought into, I can see myself getting used to this.
        You really should do more normal arcarum.

Normal arcarum gives more astras and ideans.
        Sounds like a dangerous mindset to get into
You get used to the grind and your grind for the first evoker has brought in tons of materials for your next one; So long as you aren't deliberately aiming for the same elements back to back, there's less of a buffer each time depending on what sort of route you take to get all of them.

Along with your Sandbox grinding, which helps a ton for some specific mats. Sephira Stone gating suuuuuucks.
    For real. I tried unlocking two Fire Evokers in close proximity(Alanaan in March, Fraux last month) and as a result I ran out of Verums and Astras to use for uncapping Kiss of the Devil properly. I managed to solve the Astra issue after a while but farming Verums kind of sucks.
No one is mentioning this because this community is very weird about it. But the fastest way to get evokers is to trade new world quartz for the tedious mats and let yourself be gated by straightforward things like ideans.

Ideans largely just require 9 arcarum tickets to get 4 or so from killing the boss. Astras are almost completely random. Use new world quartz to make astras to supplement whatever you're lacking when you have all of the other mats.

With this in mind, the fastest way to unlock all evokers (and the method I used) is to unlock all of the eternals so you can start getting quartz from boxes during gw. I guarantee you you will always have more than you could ever reasonably use.

At this point I have 10/10 evokers and I have Caim FLB. Lobelia is almost ready, just need to do one more domain and get a sands drop for his last weapon uncap. And all of my other NWF weapons are at least 3 stars just missing a couple of things to finish them off.

I also have 10/10 eternals with all of them FLB and 6 of them at at least 110. Eternals uncaps get WAY easier after the first one and daily angel halo pro makes it far more chill.

My approach to grinding is marathon most of it and only sprint the last 10% or so. Trading resources is always useful because you will almost always have a surplus of *something* you can trade. And if you don't have a surplus then daily host until you do.
    No one mentions it because new world quartz is an extremely limited and time-gated item. Beyond the one-time rewards from missions and tower of babyl and the ones in the shop that are never restocked, the only way to acquire more is from Tales of Arcarum and Unite and Fight events. If you trade your NWQ for farmable mats that might come back to bite you in the ass later when you need tons of them to FLB uncap your evokers and unlock their 4th skills. You need 1,200 NWQ total if you intend to collect and fully power up every evoker.
        I'm aware of this.

However if you grind the evokers slowly over time you are absolutely not being gated by NWQ there are enough consistent sources of it that you won't hit this wall before you hit other much larger walls
            I guess that's true if you farm sandbox slowly enough. But recently with regular Tales of Arcarum events massively accelerating the efficiency of farming sandbox, a sufficiently motivated player could easily hit the NWQ wall pretty fast.


I've personally reached the point where the only things preventing me from ULB uncapping all my NWF weapons + FLB uncapping every Eternal and unlocking their 4th skills is being gated by NWQ, eternity sand and sunstones. I've finished farming every other required material.
            GW is the most significant source of NWQ in the game at the moment, and I've finally started actually doing GW for nearly two years now. I also obtained all the other sources of NWQ (Tower, Tales, etc).

I have only about ~700 life time NWQ. And let me tell you, the time spent getting NWQ from GW to trade in for arcarum mats is much better spent on on actually farming those mats directly.
                I mean this is anecdotal and meaningless as my experience is directly counter to yours.

Same time frame and I have every single evoker and still have a surplus of NWQ and that's while taking detours to 40 box eternals for transcendence.

It all relies on the rate at which you focus farm the mats. Trading the mats down when you need a push to get over the line requires you to understand your resources. It's the same as when people say "if you gotta ask if you need this gold moon weapon then you're not ready for it". I wouldn't blindly tell people to trade NWQ down to 0 to rush something I am saying if you have 300 NWQ and 0 evokers you are nor burning through 300 NWQ in 2 months. You can afford to trade 20 down to speed up the final step.
                    Honestly this is also a valid take. For you do to it you actually need to understand how much you value your time(and sanity) in this situation, and I wouldn't blame someone for trading a few NWQs for those final pesky Astras you need for the unlock. However, you must also shoulder the responsibility that once you spend those, your life during NWF grind might become harder, so that's the main reason why it is not a recommended approach: you cannot expect everyone to have these levels of discernment for this decision.
Good luck, I burnt out and took around a year off thanks to transcendence and GW grinds. Now I'm just going at a pace I'm comfortable with instead of trying to rush things.
    Yeah I took a break for like 3 months because of evoker flb, eternal transcend and last year's Halloween banner.

Then I realized I was being absurd trying to force myself to keep up with youtubers. Now I let other people do the work for me and I just copy them slowly over the course of 6 months.

Just because something is no longer the fastest comp doesn't mean it can't kill something I just need to collect the pieces.
It's very debatable if Eternals are even worth the time doing in 2023 tbh. There's only 1 Eternal that you actually really, really want. Of the rest, 2 are fine, but you can easily go without, and then the other 7 range from extremely niche to outright useless. Most badly need additional transcendence levels to be relevant, but that's years away, if it ever happens at all. If you *really* didn't want to do the Eternals grind, you can honestly just ignore them and accumulate stuff from your daily AH Pro, with the only cost being that your Dark is definitely a bit gimped (although still perfectly playable).
    Are those eternals Six, Okto and Nio?

Honestly I don't really mind doing the grind, I'm in a Tier A and slack and have nothing to really prove, and haven't fully figured out which element I like and want to start really investing into (although based purely on my weapon roster, Dark seems likely). I like completing objectives, so I'll do my best to enjoy the grind and make sure I don't get too burnt out.
        Yes. 

Six is the one you really, really want because he's actually like Dark's best attacker even if you had every gacha option available. 

Okto is Earth's best ougi character but realistically you'll only use him for hosting Diaspora (which is totally optional, you can always just join other people's raids to farm the weps), playing Earth Kengo in SUBHL (which is useful, yes, but you could always play a different element or even just leech it), or coping in high NM GW if you don't have the correct characters for an auto-attack comp. And if you ever get Hrunting, he's basically totally useless.

Nio is a really good buffer and brings Dispel Cancel at 150. But she's pretty interchangable with Ewiyar as far as buffing goes, and Vampy and Naru both have permanent Dispel Cancel anyway so it's debatable how much you really need Dispel Cancel now.
    I don't agree at all that Siete is extremely niche. He's literally a get out of jail free on any V2 raid where you can bring Wind and that is NOT niche. Not when practically all of endgame is V2 raids. Wouldn't lump Sarasa under the niche category either but it's easier to see how you can go without.
        > Not when practically all of endgame is V2 raids.

Neither GW nor bar raids are v2, so no. 

Siete is good in SUBHL at 150. And, sure, you can use him for Belial/Bubz if you want, but those raids are so powercrept that you can use tons of different lineups. Besides that, not much going for him, really. Not the most motivating reason to do a several hundred hour grind.
            GW and bar raids are not endgame. I don't know what you're smoking to think that. They're still relevant to endgame players but they haven't required a high end team / grid to perform in for a very long time. You can perform perfectly fine in GW without being able to FA NM 150/ NM 200. You don't need the best of the best set ups to bar race. 

The motivating reason to at least grind for Siete 150 is that he can do something no one else can in Wind and with the cost being a much more easily obtained resource than Light's equivalent in Yuni. 

I don't really think you have a leg to stand on when by your own words, the only Eternal worth the transcendence grind is Six. But all he brings is just more damage, in an element with a monstrous roster of damage dealing characters.
You REALLY need Mystic/Nekomancer for Halo, it lets you wipe out entire waves in a single attack.
    Tweyen and Grimnir also hit all enemies, as do characters like Poseidon or V.Grim who have multihit autos
        Sure but Mystic does it on the very first swing, no waiting.  It adds up when you're grinding thousands of waves
            what is mystic ?

The trick for Bubs pubbing for bullets is to do it *after* you get the gun, honestly. Once he puts up the reflect, call your own bubs and blast the shit out of him before anyone gets the opportunity to ruin the raid. Alternatively, MC can also (barely) survive the reflects with a single Blitz Raid once you reach a certain HP threshold that I can't remember at the moment. I think it was around 60 or 70k? It'll give you new cells to blitz raid too if you had to solo the first ~30%.
Honestly it’s easier to just solo past a certain point
I wanted to finish my H/Q summons, but with my ping I literally cannot even get a skill in sometimes to at least ougi with Berserker. 

I'll just procrastinate that
    Fortunately they removed blue chests from H/Q raid so you don't need to actually do any damage for good loot drops. But you do need to at least do something, and with my ping and powercreep from new stuff like Ereshkigal I struggle to even semi-auto attack before the raid dies. So joining a train is mostly just an exercise in futility and disappointment as I won't get loot drops from half the runs. And after the new raidfinder was added to the game, I struggle to join pubbed raids before they fill up.
        Full autoing your quick summon registers marginally faster than semi auto. Might make a difference for you in some cases
Funnily enough, it's so bad that I don't even consider trans a bad grind anymore because it just feels like an RotB time-gate for me now rather than something I can actually grind out. It's still shit, just shit in a different way.
Fr, this is me with Lobelia’s weapon/uncap right now. Having to farm over 700+ veritas for each character is just insanity
    I think this is one of those things where it could depend a lot on what you had access to when you started farming? As someone who started recently enough to mostly farm in Mundus, I think the only way I'd need to farm Veritas is if the World weapon uncaps in December are worth rushing and cost an extremely high amount. I don't think it's *possible* for me to be gated by Veritas more than Astra for NWF/5\*.

For example, just *recruiting* Esta and Katze (and getting the Wind Astral) has put me at... 1152 Temperance and 700 Judgement Veritas. The other elements aren't that high except Dark (840), but for most of the other elements I've not recruited both or even one of the Evokers yet, just upgraded the summons to FLB. (I'm just waiting for the next few Tales runs to recruit their Evokers, since they'll give me enough Astras/stones to grab them and I'd rather farm towards Caim's uncap in the meantime.)
    Not really. Each individual (mainwheel) Veritas is 42% in a Sephira box (in Mundus). That's 1667 boxes to get 700 Veritas, not even counting the ones you'll get from other sources like defenders and The World. And that's enough Veritas for both of that element's evokers, since it's 42% chance for one and 42% chance for the other. You won't even be close to done with ideans or astra in 1667 chests unless you were farming regular Arcarum for years before Sandbox came out or something.
        Yeah my farming for arcarum started way before sandbox was a thing so I’m mostly struggling with the veritas grind right now. Probably because I was used to the stage skipping too
Yeah, veritas just happen naturally from the sephira chests you get while farming everything else.
    Like what another comment said, it depends, started playing arcanum before sandbox was even a thing so I was farming the ideans and astras with only tickets. Gathering astras really was a pain in the arse
Don't worry, your progress won't get thrown into the trash when M3 arrives. You will need your M2 or M2.5 grids to work on M3 after all, just like we all had to use our shabby M1 grids as a springboard towards better things one day.
    > You will need your M2 or M2.5 grids to work on M3 after all

You won't really. New players will definitely be able to just totally skip m1 and m2, just like they currently skip m1. It's not like people are sitting there grinding Colossus Omega for 5 Canes nowadays before they start doing m2. You just leech host m2 (in the future, m3) and get weps from the host chests
        I meant this for the current Magna players. Plus, depending on how hard the M3 raids are, you definitely won't be able to just skip M2 all willy nilly. You will likely need at least some pieces of it to farm the next steps, just like you cannot simply farm stuff like Ra with a Colossus Cane grid. You won't need to farm M2 entire gridset, sure, but with Regalia skip coming around, farming the basic pieces becomes easier and almost trivial.
            > just like you cannot simply farm stuff like Ra with a Colossus Cane grid. 

You literally can though. Host raid, open it up, wait for people to kill it for you, collect weapons.
                Good luck trying to survive for long enough to at least get blue chests, which is the minimum effort when you are letting others kill the raid for you. I've been in this situation not long ago,and trust me, it isn't a pleasant experience. Plus, albeit M1 does get skipped, it is mainly because it's weapons are really disastrously mid and very few of them have actually useful mods on them. M2 still has very relevant skills that might come into play in specific niches even after M3 release,so you can bet people will still tell you to farm M2 in one way or another. Only thing that changes is that they will move away from the spotlight.
                Might be different depending on the person but I think of "farm" as joining raids and getting blue chest, not just doing your daily host
        > New players will definitely be able to just totally skip m1 and m2, just like they currently skip m1. It's not like people are sitting there grinding Colossus Omega for 5 Canes nowadays before they start doing m2.

That's because new players get most of an M1 grid fully uncapped for free. Grinding M3 without farming M2 first (until/unless they start giving out free FLB M2 weapons as well) is simply not possible, just like farming M2 without filling the rest of your free M1 grid with at least filler pieces isn't possible. No,hostleeching isn't farming, you could go years without getting drops from only 2-3 shots a day.
            Doing your 3 hosts per day of m3 + your m1 skip + your m2 skip + getting what blue chests you can once you get a decent grid going is going to get you a grid capable of farming m3 just fine. 

Also this post is 7 months old...
                You won't get an M1 skip until you can actually solo M1's with ease. You won't get an M2 skip at all (you just host once instead of 3 times ans the requirements are even stricter). Neither of these will help a hew player.
                    Why would they not get an m1 skip? You need to do a 9.6m hp raid. That is not difficult at all with the freebies they give out. Heck, Bubz/250Luci/250Baha will do at least half the raid just just their call damage. If you have Bubz it's completely trivial to just call Bubz t1 then call 250Baha/Luci t2 and the raid's dead.

And they won't get an m2 skip immediately but they'll get one eventually. Literally the only difficult part is the solo kill. You can just leech the 100 kills and 30m damage in one turn is easy enough by saving all your CDs + a big summon call + a 4chain. 

I don't even understand what you're attempting to argue. Players are absolutely not going to need full m2 grids to do m3. You don't even need to get blue chest on m3 raid to get the weps, they're in the new blue-green chest.
Because you can power farm those and the only thing stopping you from getting them is yourself, at least for other stuff you are gated by daily host or using the finder for some time. Doing the 5 diamond mob for countless hours is depressing at best and there is no other way to avoid doing it, the same goes for doing Angel Halo for the stones.
    [deleted]
        Have you tried using the new finder? its basically like its not there, depending on your group or time of the day you barely have time to press a skill, let alone take a turn.
            [deleted]
                I only used raidfinder last RotB for Nio and Octo. It was actually pretty smooth post-twitter.
    Yea I'm blasting 5 bars in sandbox as we speak and while it's easy, it's also such mindless busywork. On one hand there's some sort of driving force within me still egging me on to finish it up in the span of ToA, but on the other hand I realize I could probably stretch the grind out before GW.

Hopefully I can pace myself and not get too burnt out lol
        Exactly, with tasks like those its difficult to set a pace at wich you wont end burned out, since you could basically spend all day doing it, there is also the factor of ToA, you can easily fall into the mindset of "I NEED to do this while ToA is going on or Im dumb" and then you procastinate and feel bad about it.

From chests in all zones and especially defenders in Mundus

I've got so many and I'm done with them already, while I'm not nearly close to finished with Astras and Ideanns farm
I have gotten some scamchas and suptixes, no directly paid pulls beyond the discounted 300 in March. I started my account during 2022’s anniversary cause of friends talking about free rolls; I had been seeing people tweet about the game for years and years and was curious. So I did the free rolls then, otherwise only played enough to do some side stories to get enough tickets/crystals to finish a spark, and dropped it. Then came back in December and started playing for real during those free rolls. 

So those roulettes last year might account for it? Otherwise it’s just luck one way or the other, I guess.
I can 100% say that trying to join hq lobbies from the raid finder isn't fun
    Yup I've tried it a few times the last couple of weeks and it's miserable
I meant joining for the grind. But coop is an option if you host is not that bad at certain times for carries.
Just 4* in general. I just don’t care. Fuck transcending them as well.
    4* isn't hard, don't really see the issue. Gotta play GW for the other rewards anyway.
        There isn’t. I just don’t care enough. I used to be in a top tier JP guild when I lived there between 16-17, and barely bother with GW since then in a retirement guild.
Takes time and gold bars, which you are sort of naturally gated on if you're new.

You're neither farming them nor drowning in giveaways in a short period of time.
    The gold bar gate is very miniscule because you get so many gold bars from Rise of the Beasts if you're new
    It depends on how how often RotB is running (and how quickly you ranked up since that gates Shenxian), I guess. I was able to get the gold bricks without much trouble that way.
I may be behind on what grinds exist, but it feels like nothing else is as much of a light whorl, scroll, and dragon seed drain as uncapping the Eternals. At worst, you're looking at element changing 109 weapons because you can get one Eternal for free. 

It's definitely easy and brainless once you acquire enough dark units with passive TA to semi-auto the entire process, but you still need to sit there as you get stupid amounts of light mats you don't burn as quickly through from simply uncapping light characters.
It's not a question of possibility. It's just that if you're doing it for meta reasons (e.g. Song at 110 real good, Siete 130, etc), or you just really like one of them and want to focus on them, it's not an option, you still need them all.
I honestly rushed Mundus because I heard the nodes there gives the most bang for your buck in a way. Took a bit of effort to get a 0b setup working but it was worth it, but getting only around 10 Astras per 100 chests and maybe 10-20 residually has definitely been tedious.

But yeah at least it's a grind I don't have to put much thought into, I can see myself getting used to this.
    You really should do more normal arcarum.

Normal arcarum gives more astras and ideans.
    Sounds like a dangerous mindset to get into
For real. I tried unlocking two Fire Evokers in close proximity(Alanaan in March, Fraux last month) and as a result I ran out of Verums and Astras to use for uncapping Kiss of the Devil properly. I managed to solve the Astra issue after a while but farming Verums kind of sucks.
No one mentions it because new world quartz is an extremely limited and time-gated item. Beyond the one-time rewards from missions and tower of babyl and the ones in the shop that are never restocked, the only way to acquire more is from Tales of Arcarum and Unite and Fight events. If you trade your NWQ for farmable mats that might come back to bite you in the ass later when you need tons of them to FLB uncap your evokers and unlock their 4th skills. You need 1,200 NWQ total if you intend to collect and fully power up every evoker.
    I'm aware of this.

However if you grind the evokers slowly over time you are absolutely not being gated by NWQ there are enough consistent sources of it that you won't hit this wall before you hit other much larger walls
        I guess that's true if you farm sandbox slowly enough. But recently with regular Tales of Arcarum events massively accelerating the efficiency of farming sandbox, a sufficiently motivated player could easily hit the NWQ wall pretty fast.


I've personally reached the point where the only things preventing me from ULB uncapping all my NWF weapons + FLB uncapping every Eternal and unlocking their 4th skills is being gated by NWQ, eternity sand and sunstones. I've finished farming every other required material.
        GW is the most significant source of NWQ in the game at the moment, and I've finally started actually doing GW for nearly two years now. I also obtained all the other sources of NWQ (Tower, Tales, etc).

I have only about ~700 life time NWQ. And let me tell you, the time spent getting NWQ from GW to trade in for arcarum mats is much better spent on on actually farming those mats directly.
            I mean this is anecdotal and meaningless as my experience is directly counter to yours.

Same time frame and I have every single evoker and still have a surplus of NWQ and that's while taking detours to 40 box eternals for transcendence.

It all relies on the rate at which you focus farm the mats. Trading the mats down when you need a push to get over the line requires you to understand your resources. It's the same as when people say "if you gotta ask if you need this gold moon weapon then you're not ready for it". I wouldn't blindly tell people to trade NWQ down to 0 to rush something I am saying if you have 300 NWQ and 0 evokers you are nor burning through 300 NWQ in 2 months. You can afford to trade 20 down to speed up the final step.
                Honestly this is also a valid take. For you do to it you actually need to understand how much you value your time(and sanity) in this situation, and I wouldn't blame someone for trading a few NWQs for those final pesky Astras you need for the unlock. However, you must also shoulder the responsibility that once you spend those, your life during NWF grind might become harder, so that's the main reason why it is not a recommended approach: you cannot expect everyone to have these levels of discernment for this decision.
Yeah I took a break for like 3 months because of evoker flb, eternal transcend and last year's Halloween banner.

Then I realized I was being absurd trying to force myself to keep up with youtubers. Now I let other people do the work for me and I just copy them slowly over the course of 6 months.

Just because something is no longer the fastest comp doesn't mean it can't kill something I just need to collect the pieces.
Are those eternals Six, Okto and Nio?

Honestly I don't really mind doing the grind, I'm in a Tier A and slack and have nothing to really prove, and haven't fully figured out which element I like and want to start really investing into (although based purely on my weapon roster, Dark seems likely).

    Yes. 

Six is the one you really, really want because he's actually like Dark's best attacker even if you had every gacha option available. 

Okto is Earth's best ougi character but realistically you'll only use him for hosting Diaspora (which is totally optional, you can always just join other people's raids to farm the weps), playing Earth Kengo in SUBHL (which is useful, yes, but you could always play a different element or even just leech it), or coping in high NM GW if you don't have the correct characters for an auto-attack comp. And if you ever get Hrunting, he's basically totally useless.

    I guess that's true if you farm sandbox slowly enough. But recently with regular Tales of Arcarum events massively accelerating the efficiency of farming sandbox, a sufficiently motivated player could easily hit the NWQ wall pretty fast.


I've personally reached the point where the only things preventing me from ULB uncapping all my NWF weapons + FLB uncapping every Eternal and unlocking their 4th skills is being gated by NWQ, eternity sand and sunstones. I've finished farming every other required material.
    GW is the most significant source of NWQ in the game at the moment, and I've finally started actually doing GW for nearly two years now. I also obtained all the other sources of NWQ (Tower, Tales, etc).

I have only about ~700 life time NWQ. And let me tell you, the time spent getting NWQ from GW to trade in for arcarum mats is much better spent on on actually farming those mats directly.
        I mean this is anecdotal and meaningless as my experience is directly counter to yours.

Same time frame and I have every single evoker and still have a surplus of NWQ and that's while taking detours to 40 box eternals for transcendence.

It all relies on the rate at which you focus farm the mats. Trading the mats down when you need a push to get over the line requires you to understand your resources. It's the same as when people say "if you gotta ask if you need this gold moon weapon then you're not ready for it". I wouldn't blindly tell people to trade NWQ down to 0 to rush something I am saying if you have 300 NWQ and 0 evokers you are nor burning through 300 NWQ in 2 months. You can afford to trade 20 down to speed up the final step.
            Honestly this is also a valid take. For you do to it you actually need to understand how much you value your time(and sanity) in this situation, and I wouldn't blame someone for trading a few NWQs for those final pesky Astras you need for the unlock. However, you must also shoulder the responsibility that once you spend those, your life during NWF grind might become harder, so that's the main reason why it is not a recommended approach: you cannot expect everyone to have these levels of discernment for this decision.
Yes. 

Six is the one you really, really want because he's actually like Dark's best attacker even if you had every gacha option available. 

Okto is Earth's best ougi character but realistically you'll only use him for hosting Diaspora (which is totally optional, you can always just join other people's raids to farm the weps), playing Earth Kengo in SUBHL (which is useful, yes, but you could always play a different element or even just leech it), or coping in high NM GW if you don't have the correct characters for an auto-attack comp. And if you ever get Hrunting, he's basically totally useless.

Nio is a really good buffer and brings Dispel Cancel at 150. But she's pretty interchangable with Ewiyar as far as buffing goes, and Vampy and Naru both have permanent Dispel Cancel anyway so it's debatable how much you really need Dispel Cancel now.
> Not when practically all of endgame is V2 raids.

Neither GW nor bar raids are v2, so no. 

Siete is good in SUBHL at 150. And, sure, you can use him for Belial/Bubz if you want, but those raids are so powercrept that you can use tons of different lineups. Besides that, not much going for him, really. Not the most motivating reason to do a several hundred hour grind.
    GW and bar raids are not endgame. I don't know what you're smoking to think that. They're still relevant to endgame players but they haven't required a high end team / grid to perform in for a very long time. You can perform perfectly fine in GW without being able to FA NM 150/ NM 200. You don't need the best of the best set ups to bar race. 

The motivating reason to at least grind for Siete 150 is that he can do something no one else can in Wind and with the cost being a much more easily obtained resource than Light's equivalent in Yuni. 

I don't really think you have a leg to stand on when by your own words, the only Eternal worth the transcendence grind is Six. But all he brings is just more damage, in an element with a monstrous roster of damage dealing characters.
Sure but Mystic does it on the very first swing, no waiting.  It adds up when you're grinding thousands of waves
    what is mystic ?

Full autoing your quick summon registers marginally faster than semi auto. Might make a difference for you in some cases
Yeah my farming for arcarum started way before sandbox was a thing so I’m mostly struggling with the veritas grind right now. Probably because I was used to the stage skipping too
I meant this for the current Magna players. Plus, depending on how hard the M3 raids are, you definitely won't be able to just skip M2 all willy nilly. You will likely need at least some pieces of it to farm the next steps, just like you cannot simply farm stuff like Ra with a Colossus Cane grid. You won't need to farm M2 entire gridset, sure, but with Regalia skip coming around, farming the basic pieces becomes easier and almost trivial.
    > just like you cannot simply farm stuff like Ra with a Colossus Cane grid. 

You literally can though. Host raid, open it up, wait for people to kill it for you, collect weapons.
        Good luck trying to survive for long enough to at least get blue chests, which is the minimum effort when you are letting others kill the raid for you. I've been in this situation not long ago,and trust me, it isn't a pleasant experience. Plus, albeit M1 does get skipped, it is mainly because it's weapons are really disastrously mid and very few of them have actually useful mods on them. M2 still has very relevant skills that might come into play in specific niches even after M3 release,so you can bet people will still tell you to farm M2 in one way or another. Only thing that changes is that they will move away from the spotlight.
        Might be different depending on the person but I think of "farm" as joining raids and getting blue chest, not just doing your daily host
> New players will definitely be able to just totally skip m1 and m2, just like they currently skip m1. It's not like people are sitting there grinding Colossus Omega for 5 Canes nowadays before they start doing m2.

That's because new players get most of an M1 grid fully uncapped for free. Grinding M3 without farming M2 first (until/unless they start giving out free FLB M2 weapons as well) is simply not possible, just like farming M2 without filling the rest of your free M1 grid with at least filler pieces isn't possible. No,hostleeching isn't farming, you could go years without getting drops from only 2-3 shots a day.
    Doing your 3 hosts per day of m3 + your m1 skip + your m2 skip + getting what blue chests you can once you get a decent grid going is going to get you a grid capable of farming m3 just fine. 

Also this post is 7 months old...
        You won't get an M1 skip until you can actually solo M1's with ease. You won't get an M2 skip at all (you just host once instead of 3 times ans the requirements are even stricter). Neither of these will help a hew player.
            Why would they not get an m1 skip? You need to do a 9.6m hp raid. That is not difficult at all with the freebies they give out. Heck, Bubz/250Luci/250Baha will do at least half the raid just just their call damage. If you have Bubz it's completely trivial to just call Bubz t1 then call 250Baha/Luci t2 and the raid's dead.

And they won't get an m2 skip immediately but they'll get one eventually. Literally the only difficult part is the solo kill. You can just leech the 100 kills and 30m damage in one turn is easy enough by saving all your CDs + a big summon call + a 4chain. 

I don't even understand what you're attempting to argue. Players are absolutely not going to need full m2 grids to do m3. You don't even need to get blue chest on m3 raid to get the weps, they're in the new blue-green chest.
Have you tried using the new finder? its basically like its not there, depending on your group or time of the day you barely have time to press a skill, let alone take a turn.

        I only used raidfinder last RotB for Nio and Octo. It was actually pretty smooth post-twitter.
Exactly, with tasks like those its difficult to set a pace at wich you wont end burned out, since you could basically spend all day doing it, there is also the factor of ToA, you can easily fall into the mindset of "I NEED to do this while ToA is going on or Im dumb" and then you procastinate and feel bad about it.

There isn’t. I just don’t care enough. I used to be in a top tier JP guild when I lived there between 16-17, and barely bother with GW since then in a retirement guild.
