    Golden Week 2020: "Due to feedback, we are removing all Golden Week giveaways except the double Arcarum tickets."
10 rolls daily again yay
    And it lasts until the 7th, which means free 10 draws every day of legfest.
        i dont think so, they usually dont put legfest on free things right?
            No, the legfest/flashfest dates isn't affected that much by free rolls - we got both Flashfest and Legfest during Christmas/New year campaign and 5th Anniversary Campaign, plus there are new event where they probably introduce some new SSR. 

Not like we get just 2-3 10-rolls during that campaign, which still require quite a luck.
            ?It starts tommorow, and legfest gonna be in couple days
                I mean, they did postpone the legfest in the anniversary tho and they usually dont do it when they give free rolls
                    Legfest wasn't postponed during the anniversary though. We even had a Flashfest during the Roulette
                    march's legfest still came in march on time with the new story event, so it was still on time.

sure, they likely timed it so that they wouldn't have to give you free rolls during legfest but they also wont delay legfest by like 2 weeks just because of free rolls.
                    And then they let us have flashfest with roulette
                    They didn't though?
                    They’re pretty generous, this isn’t outta the norm
            delay legfest until after 7th is very unlikely though.
It's time for silver relic farming
    I farmed one on tuesday took 160 pots. Not doing it outside of magna fest again.
        this was me with siete. amen to that.
    INTO THE MINES WE GO!
    Same wooo
        It's going to be hell, took me ages to get enough for one MLB weapon
            If you can you should run bandit tycoon and bounty up the relic fight as high as possible, I find I get way more drops and it speeds things up soooo much
                I always used journey drop for drop rate and that never got me anything 😩
                    Maybe try journey and bandit tycoon. I usually get at least 1 drop out of the 4x times ive done it.
GIVE PRAISE
    FOR HE HAS NO EQUAL
        WORSHIP HIM
            A GOD HAS BEEN BORN UNTO THE WORLD
                COWER IN FEAR
            LOVE HIM!
    YOROKOBE SHO-oh wait, wrong franchise.
Into the Angel Halo mines I go. Gotta farm for Nio recruitment/uncap.
    Same, I really need that Six full uncap
        Same! Good luck on grinding the silver gloves!
    >Into the Angel Halo mines I go. Gotta farm for Okto uncap.

Edited to suit my situation. Plus I gotta look into getting a Lucilius Earth weapon, sparking Cain, >!I already had enough from GW so the daily ten rolls are a nice bonus unless the game socks me in the balls with a surprise drop for free, RIP Betmaker!< SSRing The Hanged Man and finishing my Earth Unsigned Kanashige. (wtb Katana stones, plz)

This Earth GW I'm going to destroy it.
        Nio will be my first Eternal, so farming is going to be extra hard on me. Though from what I've been told it gets easier with each successive Eternal because you end up with a lot of surplus materials.
            Really it's the progression of strength.

When you get to the point where casual devotion of time lets you 20-box event boxes and start to or actually 44-box GW, a lot of the resources you'd farm from quests for the weapons are just gotten out of there.
Free 10 rolls for 2 weeks?!

KMR, we don't deserve you
    The same hand that gives also takes away (random bans). \*wink\*
        like a real god
        No lite mode... :peepocry:
>Double daily Arcarum ticket.  

Good
    Crap now the fact that I already never do Arcanum will feel worse...
10 rolls per day and Magna Fest.

Double Arcarum Tickets.

The time has come, and so have my pants.
    what is magna fest?
        Basically any occasion with the following benefits:

+ Half AP/EP (Co-op not included)
+ Half treasure to host some raids
+ Double Pendant Cap
+ Double Journey Drops
Double Arcanum tickets YES!!!

Wait for me Fraux I'll recruit you soon!!!
Free rolls during legfest yeyeye

Come home Pholia pls ~~so I won't have to spark you if your weapon ends up being broken~~
Oh fuck, double prestige badges starts tomorrow too, gotta get 1k in two days?
    Just do a 4-Primarchs raid train?
    Lucilius raids train 30man using mechanic reach 1k fast or host all your HL raids on strike time
Super happy about 10 rolls, will be a long time before I draw/spark most likely so them giving some away here and there to help mix it up is very appreciated. Double arca tickets is super good, especially since Im 2 ideans away from SSRing one. Also after the buff Im actually looking forward to the campaign quest again, free sliming essentially with bonus scales. And double pendants is always good, now I can grab the last axe I need before the day of gw and play around with m2 earth a bit.
Oh dear, looks like it's slimeblasting time...
    Hello, i expect not bother you. It's just that i recognize you nickname somehow. Did you play/played soccer spirits?
        Yes, I did play Soccer Spirits at one point. I used the name Sachiko there at one point as well, if that sounds familiar too.
            Oh, then it must be from the SS forum (not the official one). Good to see that some people from there are playing Granblue.
                Ah, nice to encounter a fellow SS forumer! I'm afraid I don't recognize you by your name, but nevertheless, I wish you luck on your journeys.
                    That's because my name in the forum was Imbm haha. I wish you luck on your journeys too!
*I'm wet*
    Name checks out
Free ten rolls? So passe. Double Arcarum tickets? Let me in, let me in, I need that shit, I need that shit bad.
Hoo, thank golly. Was having withdraws waiting for this
YESSSSS. 

10 rolls aside, the pendant cap increase will let me get my first MLB Cele Claw and my first AES.
ah I've got to start doing my Arcarum runs more

time to dip my feet into Extreme

more free skill fodder rolls pls lol, time to give my earth grid a kick in the ass
I'm now at 143/300 for my spark funds which was my excess during Grimnir spark, so I probably will be saving that (and any other tickets that will come) for my summer spark instead whenever it goes live.
Nice, we´ll need all the quartz and weapon stones we can get for all the new stuff that damn shop ask us for.

And Double Arca tickets is nice.

Aren´t the free rolls only until the 7th or am I reading that wrong?

What is a golden week?

        >In Japan, it is a law that if a day falls between two holidays then it becomes a holiday itself

Man, how i wish that is a thing in my country, working at the day that sandwiched between 2 holidays is the worst >.<
        It's like Othello.
        Wow ty man I didnt know any of it. I thought may 1st is a holyday everywhere in the world, was wrong I guess
            Pardon my ignorance. But what is celebrated on May 1st? I dont recall anything special about it in Australia.
                International Worker´s Day
                Labor Day.
                    Huh. Labor Day is in September in the US/Canada. Didn't know it was in May elsewhere. Maybe because it falls too close to US's Memorial Day in late May.
                        Well for some part of the world, like mine in Vietnam, Labor Day is International Worker's Day.
                            well Vietnam is still technically Communist, so of course they would celebrate May Day.

The US moved its "labor day" to September, *specifically* to avoid that socialist history
                                Most countries have it on [the first of May](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Workers'_Day ) because it was the date of the european [May Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_Day) festivity, but the date was chosen too after [an event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haymarket_affair) that happened on May 4, 1886, in Chicago, which makes it funny that the US has it on September (surely because the 1st of May date was chosen by socialist and communist groups).
                    Is it the type of holiday where everything is closed, or are supermarkets and fast food still open?
                        Depends on your country, worktime laws, and company standards. No idea about Australia, so in case of doubt just try barging in somewhere.
                        Nah Supermarkets and Fast Food will still be open. It's the international day for worker after all, people's gonna buy shits.
            It's *usually* a holiday, but not a holy day, lol.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Workers%27_Day
    a series of individual holidays in Japan that lines up to an entire week of holidays
    It's a string of holidays in Japan in a week. Starting from April 29- May 5
Monica pls come home...
I can't decide to whether Spark in this Golden weeks for Anila and finish my fire spear team or save till August and hope Summer Scath will show up ~.~
    Zodiacs
    I blew my spark on Grimnir now hoping to save up for summer. Summer sparks are great I recommend saving!!
    Im planning to save until new year to spark next, but if I can somehow get the draws together summer scath is prob the one thing that could make me draw early, if shes decently strong (plz dont be wind too)
    I'll be having the same problem if Mahira shows up. If they introduce some new good earth characters I might give in.
Why is the AP / EP reduction and higher pendant cap not active yet?
    they usually activate around 6 pm jst
    because magnafest staggers a bit. the first thing that goes up is always the free pulls, since they need to tie that to daily reset (5 am), but the cost reductions usually go off ~ the time they would normally start new events after school/work hours, 6PM
> 2x Arca tickets

As a Persona fan, It looks cool, I've seen it coming and I've been waiting for this!
    you wanna check that comment again?
        Not the biggest Persona fan, but probably references.

"Looking cool Jooker"

"You never see it coming"

Dunno for the last one.
            Oh that makes sense. "I've been waiting for this!" is from Persona 3 I think
            It actually surprises me that only some get reminded of the Persona or Jojo franchise when we talk about Arcarum / Evoker stuff... Even Persona 3 memes get obsolete now huh

Guess I'm already old.
                Your comment is just so random and out of place lol
                 I mean, Persona hardly has a monopoly on Tarot thematology, so it's expected people will be confused at the connection. *shrug*


EDIT: Heck, most anime fans probably thing of Stardust Crusaders first.
                    Well, the second layer that they're referencing there is that the gun they put to their heads in P3 to summon their Persona is an Evoker.
                Sony exclusives always made it hard for me to get into the Persona franchise so my only exposure comes from Anime.

I can see the parallels with companions based on tarot cards though. Mainly Star Platinum reminds me of Jojo though.
Expected this will come in a day or two, considering so much complaints on recent update on JP wiki.

        Legfest wasn't postponed during the anniversary though. We even had a Flashfest during the Roulette
        march's legfest still came in march on time with the new story event, so it was still on time.

sure, they likely timed it so that they wouldn't have to give you free rolls during legfest but they also wont delay legfest by like 2 weeks just because of free rolls.
        And then they let us have flashfest with roulette
        They didn't though?
        They’re pretty generous, this isn’t outta the norm
delay legfest until after 7th is very unlikely though.
If you can you should run bandit tycoon and bounty up the relic fight as high as possible, I find I get way more drops and it speeds things up soooo much
    I always used journey drop for drop rate and that never got me anything 😩
        Maybe try journey and bandit tycoon. I usually get at least 1 drop out of the 4x times ive done it.
A GOD HAS BEEN BORN UNTO THE WORLD
    COWER IN FEAR
LOVE HIM!
Really it's the progression of strength.

When you get to the point where casual devotion of time lets you 20-box event boxes and start to or actually 44-box GW, a lot of the resources you'd farm from quests for the weapons are just gotten out of there.
Oh, then it must be from the SS forum (not the official one). Good to see that some people from there are playing Granblue.
    Ah, nice to encounter a fellow SS forumer! I'm afraid I don't recognize you by your name, but nevertheless, I wish you luck on your journeys.
        That's because my name in the forum was Imbm haha. I wish you luck on your journeys too!
Pardon my ignorance. But what is celebrated on May 1st? I dont recall anything special about it in Australia.
    International Worker´s Day
    Labor Day.
        Huh. Labor Day is in September in the US/Canada. Didn't know it was in May elsewhere. Maybe because it falls too close to US's Memorial Day in late May.
            Well for some part of the world, like mine in Vietnam, Labor Day is International Worker's Day.
                well Vietnam is still technically Communist, so of course they would celebrate May Day.

The US moved its "labor day" to September, *specifically* to avoid that socialist history
                    Most countries have it on [the first of May](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Workers'_Day ) because it was the date of the european [May Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_Day) festivity, but the date was chosen too after [an event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haymarket_affair) that happened on May 4, 1886, in Chicago, which makes it funny that the US has it on September (surely because the 1st of May date was chosen by socialist and communist groups).
        Is it the type of holiday where everything is closed, or are supermarkets and fast food still open?
            Depends on your country, worktime laws, and company standards. No idea about Australia, so in case of doubt just try barging in somewhere.
            Nah Supermarkets and Fast Food will still be open. It's the international day for worker after all, people's gonna buy shits.
It's *usually* a holiday, but not a holy day, lol.

Oh that makes sense. "I've been waiting for this!" is from Persona 3 I think
It actually surprises me that only some get reminded of the Persona or Jojo franchise when we talk about Arcarum / Evoker stuff... Even Persona 3 memes get obsolete now huh

Guess I'm already old.
    Your comment is just so random and out of place lol
     I mean, Persona hardly has a monopoly on Tarot thematology, so it's expected people will be confused at the connection. *shrug*


EDIT: Heck, most anime fans probably thing of Stardust Crusaders first.
        Well, the second layer that they're referencing there is that the gun they put to their heads in P3 to summon their Persona is an Evoker.
    Sony exclusives always made it hard for me to get into the Persona franchise so my only exposure comes from Anime.

I can see the parallels with companions based on tarot cards though. Mainly Star Platinum reminds me of Jojo though.
