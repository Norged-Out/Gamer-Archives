[[New characters Dragon zodiac Hira SSR Lowain bros, and tyra]]





Hira is, not the accurate name for english i assume but shes voiced by rie takahashi!

Tyra is also playable after the summon in summer And is in the end of month event!
    en name will probably be Payila or close to that
Haira is GORGEOUS

and massive, she seems a bit tall for a Draph though? She might be something else, reminds me of Fediel. Maybe she's an actual dragon

hard to tell what element she is from her design
    She looks a lot like Grea and Filine so she may be a dragon indeed. Probably not a true dragon like Scathath though.
        She definitely has a tail I would say, it's just very faintly noticeable behind the flowing cloth, so I think you're onto something with Grea and Filene comparison. EDIT: oh wait, that's just the tail of the dragon behind her :/ WHICH I'm okay with. The thicc af dragon girl tail isn't really my cup of tea lol
        LOL. To me she looks like a reskinned Galleon...
    In before "It's just a Hairband lol"
    At least that grey dragon seems to have fiery effects in it
    Fire if boring western dragon route, but water if asian dragon route
R/SRs turned SSRs this year:

* Friday (technically last year, but Dec 31 is close enough)
* Yaia
* Jasmine
* Drusilla
* Paris
* Sevilbarra
* Volenna
* Barawa
* Sarya
* Lowain (and bros)
* ~~Not Deliford RIP~~
    I need SSR Daetta.
    How many more left?
        A lot, to put it bluntly. Like even if they give two of them a SSR every month I don't think we'd be done in one year.
            I'm trying to think of them just off the top of my head and I keep coming up with more and more. 24 is definitely a low estimate.
    I need SSR Vermeil
Haira looks like a primal, could probably be the only OG zodiac member.



Edit: I thought he had a tail but I just realized that tail is from the dragon on the back, so the primal theory is weaker but her design seems “tall” so I’m still hoping that she’s not a draph.


Edit 2: just remembered that makura is an erune, so I guess the 3 for each of the main race thing is dead since we already have 4 erunes now, so 4 draphs is also possible as well.
    Didn't Vajra uncap episode mention that the OG zodiac member were all males?

Edit: Ooo Basara (the 1st Dog Divine General) said that male Divine Generals were common. So it was not all males, but we could assume that a good amount of them (maybe half?) of them were males.

Btw she looks like she's Draph. She has the Draph boobs, Draph ears, horns, and her sprite shown in this tweet https://x.com/granbluefantasy/status/1738494601244336260?s=20 looks Draph.
        Hmm.

She's missing that iconic short Draph height and Draph baby face (wide and short with seemingly chubby cheeks).

But who knows, maybe the character designers got fed up and decided to change everything.
        Nope, only that they were common.
        If I recall, and I could be wrong, the original Rat was not only female but was considered the leader of the generals.
        Don’t have her 🥲
    For real, as soon as I saw the art for her, she really doesn't feel as if she'd fit this current generation.
    Might be, wish it is. I'm curious since the most common trope I know when it comes to the Zodiac is that the Dragon's always is the 1st Gen member due to their long life while the rest have successors.
She looks so coolll!!!!
Her tits are comically enormous.
    They kinda don't blend well with her outfit, like if they just put some honkadonka badonkas later to sell better
        They got that big balloon look. I *like* big honking badonkas, but these just don't do it, something unnatural. It actually does almost look like they were photoshopped larger lol.
            Yeah, or a bad boob job or something. They seem a bit too "buoyant" for their size, even though they tried to give them the appearance of a little sag. Plus the areolae would have to be disproportionally small based on the size of the "windows" through the fabric, which also subtly makes them seem unnatural to me. (Sorry ladies for obsessively picking apart her boobs)
                No that's fine, they just look too perfectly round is unnatural, something that big needs gravity and weight to them, is not the early 2000's anymore, they can do better that sex doll blow up boobage
                    Oh yeah, I know all about real boob physics too lol They should be saggier, like Summer Cupitan for example. And I agree, they can do better. Another one that annoys me with that is Hallessena. The Tyra event reminded me how weird hers look.
                        Oh draphs tend to go the "round objects attached to chest" aproach super often, specially the ones with old art, Just look at ANY art of Carmelina
                            Yeah, I agree about the old art. The majority of newer characters seem to be drawn with more realistic boob physics, which I appreciate as an artist.
    Yeah, there's something about them that bothers me, even beyond normal Draph standards (including Fediel/Galleon for that matter).  The outfit is probably part of it.
    Your mom is comically enormous.

Sorry I had to.
    First time seeing a draph?
        You think that's a draph?
            Horns, draph ears, big tiddies.
                Grea and Filene also have the same sort of ears, so I'm thinking she may be a Dragonewt
                She seems too tall but the ears are a convincing point.
                    Draph proportions are weird sometimes, they are short but their art make their legs long, look at some of Anila’s art and how… normal she looks.
    Boobs contain the hopes and dreams of men. And the Zodiacs have the distinct role of protecting hopes and dreams and dispelling bad vibes.

So it makes perfect sense why she's so big\~. ~~Also she's probably a Draph. Sooooooo.....~~
These Zodiac outfits are getting so silly that the fact they're insistent on keeping the miko sleeves is extremely funnier than they intend.
Tyra lesgooo
    Uwoo 😭
Holy shit, Haira's boobs are gigantic even for Draph standard lmao
One day the granblue artist will learn how to draw feet
Man, these last 2 Zodiacs designs just haven't been hits for me... Which is sad because they are my favorite group in the game.
    Exactly how I've been feeling. I honestly wish they'd just go back to the style they used for the first 5 at this point. I don't blame them for experimenting, but it's been a long time now since we've got that style and it was a great style they could still explore more with.
where are her nipples
    on her boobs, hopefully
        preferebly on the areola
    lol I also noticed this. Her areola would have to be disproportionately small to be on those boobs. Maybe she's the first GBF character to have implants.
    Its a dimension storage dress for sure.
    Definitely my first question
    In the Adult Only server of granblue
My god her boobs are massively OP
    Such is the power of dragons.
Sheeesh, Lowain Bros got nice drip
I feel like I'd like her more if her boob's weren't so comically big and just regular draph size, could be worse tho.
    Can you give an example of regular draph size?because from what I remember all draphs have big boobs. Eg: Fediel, Anila, Galleon, Narmaya
        >Galleon

Galleon isn't a Draph... her mortal form's race is best described as "yes"
        Yeah, and this character has bigger tits than all them LOL.
        Hers are bigger than all those characters and even bigger than Summer Cupitan, who looks really ridiculous to me. I don't have anything against big booba characters (why the hell would I play this game if I did) but when they're that big I can't take the design serious.
            Cupitan's seems less bad in her summer unit since they got a nice shape and sag a little (her normal unit uncap they look like two torpedos).

Haira seems to have a similar head/boobs ratio than Cupitan, but hers is somewhat compressed by her clothes and too round imo
            She is Magisa's Size.
I see jumbo sized tts, I roll
She looks like she might be an actual dragon
Hmm I like her design better than Makura, but can't say she'd rank high among the divine generals for me.

Happy that Lowain is finally getting an SSR, not someone I'd go out of my way to pull though.

Neat that Tyra is getting a playable version too, figured it was a matter of time.
    Honestly my favorite and most interesting design out of the zodiacs. But her chest is kinda comical and hurts her design.
        If the zodiacs are supposed to be a somewhat cohesive group, it's extremely weird for number ten to go "naw fuck that". They've obviously played in the space before but this is even further out than Catura. It's entirely possible there's a lore reason, like she's a primal and the dragon zodiac doesn't change hands, but just going off design it's real odd. (And even then we've seen an OG zodiac, Basara doesn't stray too far outside the loose design parameters of the rest of them.)
    >Hmm I like her design better than Makura, but can't say she'd rank high among the divine generals for me.

Yeah that's where I'm at but fate episodes and (hopeful) event appearances matter a lot.
The middle portion of her outfit is a bit of a letdown but it can be somewhat made up for with a good skin or just trying my best to ignore that portion of the outfit. If her personality sucks ass it's so joever for me so I'm praying that part is at least good. I don't want this to be another character that i instantly hit the skip button on the moment they come on the screen
nice. Time to save spark for 2024 since as always I'm not getting anything new from roulette specially her or new grand

also

>!rule63 of [Dan Heng • Imbibitor Lunae](https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/Dan_Heng_%E2%80%A2_Imbibitor_Lunae) lmao!<
    We got two nickels for getting two black-green haired dragon yay
        I think that there are more examples. Arknights has one or two similar dragon(?)girls I think.
            Maybe its just a typical Chinese dragon color theme haha
Her outfit is the classic sexy mage style, I think aside from Magisa and Fediel we actually haven't seen anyone else with this design for some time.
Kinda hope she had lizard tail like grea,..
Oh well
the fuck is going on in dragon zodiac's boobular region
Hira/Haira/whatever her name will be, probably Wind?

And yeah, to address the elephant in the room, her boobs \*are\* pretty ginormous, and she \*does\* look a bit tall for a Draph... BUT I would argue that some of it is an "optical illusion" of sorts due to her wearing tall platform shoes and having a slender body.

I would also argue that she is not Draph, but instead Dragonewt.

Her horns and boobs and even her ears \*seem to\* suggest Draph... BUT Filene and Grea also have the same type of ears. It would also just make sense for the Dragon Zodiac to actually be part dragon. That said, she seems to be missing a the classic Dragonewt tail... which I'm fine with, because I think those tails are extremely impractical and way too thicc. Or maybe she does have a tail but it's a cute little bobtail lol

As for the others... hints of blue in the Lowain Bros clothes, looking drippy af, probably Water? Tyra probably Fire?
    Unlikely to be wind, since we got Catura as the wind zodiac for this cycle. The first 6 Zodiacs all had unique elements, and so far none of the last 6 have doubled.
        Oh yeah that's right, we have Andira and Catura. I guess that leaves what, fire, water, earth and dark as possibilities. I am thinking maybe Fire then... my very cursory research on the the general shows that a flaming sword is one of the things they're known for.
    It's Haira (*ha-ee-ra*). Cygames draws from the [Twelve Heavenly Generals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_Heavenly_Generals) from the East Asian Buddhism. The original game text uses their Japanese names, while English translation uses variants of their Sanskrit names.
        I knew it was based on the 12 Heavenly Generals but didn't know their whole process for naming them in Japanese and English. So I guess realistically she probably will be Payila and not Haira, or something similar to Payila, at least in English... Payira would be a nice compromise
Goddamm i love Dragons.
Good design. Would prefer less fanservice part on her chest though (talking about how her nipple is barely hidden in that yellow metal thing).
    Lol nah, the metal thingy doesn't cover her nipples, they are supposed to be much lower than that I think, like barely covered by her clothes
Dragon Zodiac looks awesome. Can't wait to pull for her.
Probably the worse design outfit wise zodiac for me. And people hated Catura for her design when she's released but fine with this lol
Huh. So there is such a thing as "too much titty".
Takahashi Rie! Oh god time to spark is here!
Awww, no harvin or tyra lizard = dragon meme yet I think this design is awesome and fits pretty well next year.

But yeah what up with her being so tall because I thought she was a draph at first. Someone related to the six dragons? Half dragon?
    Draph women have weird proportions and aren't necessarily as tall as they look.
I'm not sure about Haira's giant Hairas or her costume design, but Rierin voicing a dragon = spark
The Hololive thing now makes sense, since those are definitely Coco's hadonkadonkers.
Dragon please be fire
Looking Haira, it's seem similar from arknight no?
I don't know how Cy is doing it, but they somehow always are like "Oh, you got a fav character(design)? What about this new one though?"
I'm preparing myself for Haira to be Water but it's really really cruel that Cygames is making us Fire players go TEN YEARS between Zodiacs
    Then again, it's kind of fitting if what started with Fire (Anila) also ends with Fire (Horse zodiac).
11/10 char 
My spark is ready
fuck me , its rie takashi , its a fucking instant pull and ring
These Zodiac designs have nosedived so much since Kumbhira tbh. We used to occasionally get really sleek and elegant designs like Vajra, and now all we get are these overdesigned titty monster messes
    Heyyy I will not tolerate any slander toward Vikala
    Tits are one thing but i wish the outfit designs were more cohesive, those seem to go all over the place nowadays.
    You apologize to Makura this instant heathen
    Kumbhira is when they started messing with the formula, and Cidala is more in line with Vajra than Kumbhira is.
She is wind?
    Could be any of Water, Dark or Fire. People are trying to guess her element based on her design but that's never meant anything for Zodiac characters.
    Unlikely, we already have 2 winds would be unfair for the other elements, she’s most likely water imo
        Wind should stop being greedy.
        Wind should stop being greedy.
Is the Lowain bros supposed to be a grand version?
    Just an ssr i believe
    Sounded like they be normal chars as well as Tyra, i think they announce the grand(s) tommorow.
She's cute, but I consider Tyra not being the dragon general to be a personal slight against me and I WILL go to cygames office to cry about it /j

Dinosaur in japanese is literally 'fearsome dragon' it would've been perfect!
Lowain and bros finally getting their ssr after forever. I hope they get a good kit.
I have been wondering what the dragon would look like and I am not disappointed. Time to party like it's 2024 boys!
There’s no way Lowain’s gettin’ an Ssr, you’re fucking with me (please be real)
    It's right there in the screenshot...
        As far as I’m concerned it’s just a render for another event involving Lowain and bros for the 5th time
            Be intentionally dumb then idk xDD
                Damn what’s wrong with being cautious over the fact that the render of Lowain and Tyra came just before an event announcement
                    They had Lowain's VA stand up on stage and announce that Lowain is finally getting an SSR. You can rest easy now.
                        Fuck yeah
                    I don't know what else you think it could be lmao
                        Optimism isn’t a strong suit
                            This isn't optimism, you're just being pessimistic

Optimism = they announced he's getting an alt, surely it'll be broken!

Realism = they said he's getting an alt, so he's getting an alt

Pessimism = they said he's getting an alt, but they must be lying, it def ain't happening
                                Again, it *isn’t* a strong suit
    Final banner of the year, last year we got Micheal. So get ready for Grand Lowain Bros
        Nah, the grands getting announced tomorrow
Dragon design is fine I guess, new ssrs are mid. Hopefully new grand is more exciting.
For God sake, Dragon need  to be Fire !
I lost I lost I lost I lost I lost 😭😭😭
Walder when D:
Your spark is ready baby cakes, just gotta enter the draw pool.
Possibly the new zodiac is water and she's gonna pull Tyra under her wing as the next dragon zodiac maybe. Not too common to have a double water banner.
    Tyra’s summon being water doesn’t guarantee she will be.
    Tyra is already going to be playable, I doubt they would ever release a super limited characters like zodiac as standard unit.
Wait... she isn't blonde. Also I think she's wind.
    There's already 2 wind Zodiacs. Dark, Water and Fire are the only elements with 1 Zodiac, so Dragon, Snake and Horse are going to be one of those.
Are they going to be new units in year end flash and premium? Or we will a completely different chars?
Flash fest this end year? Tyra and Lowsin bros?
    Yep flash end of year, tho it will be Lowain bros and a Grand that will be announced on tomorrow livestream
        Thanks!
i forgot how it works, is the zodiac in or after the holiday pool\`?
    No. Only available on new year.
New player here, any news on when will she be getting her banner? Gonna save up for her.
    Considering she's the yearly Zodiac, unless Cygames suddenly changes the way they've done things for the last 9 years, her banner will be the new year's banner, which will start on the 31st at 12 PM JST.
        Is that how they do it normally? Thanks for the info and nice to know. I assume it'll be around for 2 weeks or so? Hopefully, I can gather enough to spark for her by then. 

Actually, how much do you need for a spark in gbf?
            Banners only stay for a few days. Last year's Zodiac banner, for example, lasted about 4 days. That's a pretty typical length for a banner in GBF.

Sparks need 300 pulls, and there's no other form of pity. That might seem like a lot, but the game is generous enough that you can, if you actively play, spark multiple times a year. And it's advised save up for a spark before doing any pulling, because the rates are... not particularly good.  
As a reference point, for an average rate up character that's just been introduced, you have about 60% chance of getting them during a full spark (300 pulls).

What helps with sparking is that they're doing roulettes twice a year. Roulette is where, every day for the duration of the event, you get to spin a roulette for between 10 and 200 free pulls (don't *expect* 200, but it's certainly possible to hit it). They've added other stuff to roulettes over the years, such as the gachapin bar (fills quicker if you get less pulls; when full, enter Gachapin Frenzy and pull until you get an SSR or 300 pulls), Mukku Frenzy (if your Gachapin Frenzy sucked and was over too quick, high chance of getting a Mukku Frenzy, which is basically the same), free 200 pulls at the end of the roulette (but not on a Gala banner for the winter roulette), or Super Mukku Frenzy (like Gachapin/Mukku Frenzy, but you roll until you get 5 SSRs, and all pulls have increased SSR rates).

By the way. That winter roulette I mentioned? Started today. Might have already seen it. Will run through the duration of the Zodiac banner. Worst case, you'll get 40 or 50 free pulls on it, but it's very likely to be more. Might even get enough free pulls/frenzies for a free spark. Might randomly get the new Zodiac from pulls. You'll have to see!

Also, because it's worth mentioning: Roulette draws reset at a different time than banner changes. You could save up the draws from the day where the Zodiac banner will start and use them on that, and then just use every further roulette roll on that banner, too. Or you could use the roulette draws from that day for the previous banner, which will also be a Gala banner, but with different characters. Up to you.

Oh, also also: As the new yearly Zodiac, she will be on every end-of-month Premium Gala banner up until and including November. She won't have a notable rate-up, but she can be sparked. In case you won't be able to spark her on the new year's banner, you'll have 11 more chances to save up for her. (But after that, she'll take the year off and won't be normally available.)
                >Banners only stay for a few days. Last year's Zodiac banner, for example, lasted about 4 days. That's a pretty typical length for a banner in GBF.

Hmm... Guess I should prioritise finishing the story faster. Sorry for another question, how do I get more of the gacha currency? Just want to cover all my bases.

Think I'll just save that up till she comes out.

So does premium mean only 'bought' gacha currency works? I remember Dragalia Lost had something similar to it, so I assume its the same, since Cygames did run DL as well.
                    >Hmm... Guess I should prioritise finishing the story faster. Sorry for another question, how do I get more of the gacha currency? Just want to cover all my bases.

Probably the most important gacha currency, Rainbow Crystals can be gotten in many ways. Doing stories (including main story and side stories) is a good one-time source. The first Fate Episode of every character you get also gives 50 crystals. Trophies (achievements, if you prefer) mostly give crystals, in often smaller amounts, but they're not worth chasing specifically, you'll get them by playing. Currently, there is a login campain that gives you 200 crystals per day. There's freebies from time to time, such as during the three big streams each year... one of which is today/tomorrow, and you should already have 3k crystals in your crate, expecting more tomorrow. The monthly story event comes with crystals in its event-specific draw box (only for the first 20 boxes, coming to 1950 total, I think). Other events usually give crystals. Some eventy have daily missions that give you crystals (such as the current re-run event, The Divine Generals Assembly, which gives you 100 crystals daily for participating in 5 raid battles, can be your own). 

The other important gacha currencies is straight-up tickets. You get them... for doing events, mostly. One here, one there. They just add up over time. There's one you get for every fifth day you log in, too.

There's not really a *premium* currency in GBF. You can't straight-up buy crystals. You can, depending on your login provider, buy mobacoins/granblue coins through them and spend those on pulls. But... at least for mobacoins, those are mobage specific, not GBF specfic.  


>So does premium mean only 'bought' gacha currency works? I remember Dragalia Lost had something similar to it, so I assume its the same, since Cygames did run DL as well.

No, that's just the name they chose for some things. Tickets are officially called "Premium Draw Ticket", but they're just... normal gacha tickets that cannot be bought with money, but can be used on whatever the current banner is.

When I say Premium Gala, I mean the [end-of-month Gala banner](https://gbf.wiki/Draw#Premium_Gala). Sometimes also called Leg Fest, which I believe comes from its japanese name, Legend Fest. Or something.  
It's to distinguish it from Flash Gala, which is the [middle-of-month Gala banner](https://gbf.wiki/Draw#Flash_Gala) (and also sometimes called Flash Fest).

And just to pre-empt the next question: A Gala banner is a banner with double the SSR rate (6% instead of 3%). They happen twice a month\*, they're when new characters are introduced\*\*, and both types of Gala have their own specific pools of units that are always only available/sparkable on their respective Galas. That's pretty important, because those units are Grand units\*\*\*, and Grand units are usually the most desirable units (as are their weapons, if they're not too old). 

The general consensus is to never throw pulls at a non-gala banner. There are exceptions, but those are usually borne out of either desperation, or love. Or both. Or maybe you've got a non-limited character that you really want and it's sparkable at the end of the winter roulette and you've already got 200 pulls + however many from Super Mukku Frenzy for free and you'd only need to spent, like, 30 pulls to finish the spark. Then, I'd consider that acceptable, too.

\* Unless they don't. March, the anniversary month, has a two-part Premium Gala that starts earlier than usual. August used to have that, too. December has a Flash gala in the middle, then another right at the end before the usual Premium gala.  
\*\* Unless they're not There was a time when they introduced so many new characters during summer months that they couldn't fit them all on Gala banners, so they usually had a non-gala banner with new characters... but luckily, they stopped doing that.  
\*\*\* Unless they're not. Zodiacs are also Premium gala exclusives, but they don't follow the same rules as Grands. Instead, you always get the current year's Zodiac available and sparkable on a Premium Gala, as well as one more, rotating through all previous ones. *Except* for the one from the year before, because that one's taking the whole year off.
                        Thank ypu very much for the detailed explanation!!!
    If you dont feel confident you can get her this january, she will also be sparkable in end of March banner where we also get a guaranteed 100 rolls from roulette
        Isn't 200 since it is End of roulette? Can somebody who has already done roulette tell me.
        My plan is basically go all in for her in Jan, and if I don't, I'll be saving up for March.
So i've been thinking, what if dragon is actually water cuz her dragon is in the style of seiryu and well they are often depicted as water dragons. Knowing cygames, they wont let us have too much nice things before gw.
en name will probably be Payila or close to that
She looks a lot like Grea and Filine so she may be a dragon indeed. Probably not a true dragon like Scathath though.
    She definitely has a tail I would say, it's just very faintly noticeable behind the flowing cloth, so I think you're onto something with Grea and Filene comparison. EDIT: oh wait, that's just the tail of the dragon behind her :/ WHICH I'm okay with. The thicc af dragon girl tail isn't really my cup of tea lol
    LOL. To me she looks like a reskinned Galleon...
In before "It's just a Hairband lol"
At least that grey dragon seems to have fiery effects in it
Fire if boring western dragon route, but water if asian dragon route
I need SSR Daetta.
How many more left?
    A lot, to put it bluntly. Like even if they give two of them a SSR every month I don't think we'd be done in one year.
        I'm trying to think of them just off the top of my head and I keep coming up with more and more. 24 is definitely a low estimate.
I need SSR Vermeil
Didn't Vajra uncap episode mention that the OG zodiac member were all males?

Edit: Ooo Basara (the 1st Dog Divine General) said that male Divine Generals were common. So it was not all males, but we could assume that a good amount of them (maybe half?) of them were males.

Btw she looks like she's Draph. She has the Draph boobs, Draph ears, horns, and her sprite shown in this tweet https://x.com/granbluefantasy/status/1738494601244336260?s=20 looks Draph.
    Hmm.

She's missing that iconic short Draph height and Draph baby face (wide and short with seemingly chubby cheeks).

But who knows, maybe the character designers got fed up and decided to change everything.
    Nope, only that they were common.
    If I recall, and I could be wrong, the original Rat was not only female but was considered the leader of the generals.
    Don’t have her 🥲
For real, as soon as I saw the art for her, she really doesn't feel as if she'd fit this current generation.
Might be, wish it is. I'm curious since the most common trope I know when it comes to the Zodiac is that the Dragon's always is the 1st Gen member due to their long life while the rest have successors.
They kinda don't blend well with her outfit, like if they just put some honkadonka badonkas later to sell better
    They got that big balloon look. I *like* big honking badonkas, but these just don't do it, something unnatural. It actually does almost look like they were photoshopped larger lol.
        Yeah, or a bad boob job or something. They seem a bit too "buoyant" for their size, even though they tried to give them the appearance of a little sag. Plus the areolae would have to be disproportionally small based on the size of the "windows" through the fabric, which also subtly makes them seem unnatural to me. (Sorry ladies for obsessively picking apart her boobs)
            No that's fine, they just look too perfectly round is unnatural, something that big needs gravity and weight to them, is not the early 2000's anymore, they can do better that sex doll blow up boobage
                Oh yeah, I know all about real boob physics too lol They should be saggier, like Summer Cupitan for example. And I agree, they can do better. Another one that annoys me with that is Hallessena. The Tyra event reminded me how weird hers look.
                    Oh draphs tend to go the "round objects attached to chest" aproach super often, specially the ones with old art, Just look at ANY art of Carmelina
                        Yeah, I agree about the old art. The majority of newer characters seem to be drawn with more realistic boob physics, which I appreciate as an artist.
Yeah, there's something about them that bothers me, even beyond normal Draph standards (including Fediel/Galleon for that matter).  The outfit is probably part of it.
Your mom is comically enormous.

Sorry I had to.
First time seeing a draph?
    You think that's a draph?
        Horns, draph ears, big tiddies.
            Grea and Filene also have the same sort of ears, so I'm thinking she may be a Dragonewt
            She seems too tall but the ears are a convincing point.
                Draph proportions are weird sometimes, they are short but their art make their legs long, look at some of Anila’s art and how… normal she looks.
Boobs contain the hopes and dreams of men. And the Zodiacs have the distinct role of protecting hopes and dreams and dispelling bad vibes.

So it makes perfect sense why she's so big\~. ~~Also she's probably a Draph. Sooooooo.....~~
Uwoo 😭
Exactly how I've been feeling. I honestly wish they'd just go back to the style they used for the first 5 at this point. I don't blame them for experimenting, but it's been a long time now since we've got that style and it was a great style they could still explore more with.
on her boobs, hopefully
    preferebly on the areola
lol I also noticed this. Her areola would have to be disproportionately small to be on those boobs. Maybe she's the first GBF character to have implants.
Its a dimension storage dress for sure.
Definitely my first question
In the Adult Only server of granblue
Such is the power of dragons.
Can you give an example of regular draph size?because from what I remember all draphs have big boobs. Eg: Fediel, Anila, Galleon, Narmaya
    >Galleon

Galleon isn't a Draph... her mortal form's race is best described as "yes"
    Yeah, and this character has bigger tits than all them LOL.
    Hers are bigger than all those characters and even bigger than Summer Cupitan, who looks really ridiculous to me. I don't have anything against big booba characters (why the hell would I play this game if I did) but when they're that big I can't take the design serious.
        Cupitan's seems less bad in her summer unit since they got a nice shape and sag a little (her normal unit uncap they look like two torpedos).

Haira seems to have a similar head/boobs ratio than Cupitan, but hers is somewhat compressed by her clothes and too round imo
        She is Magisa's Size.
Honestly my favorite and most interesting design out of the zodiacs. But her chest is kinda comical and hurts her design.
    If the zodiacs are supposed to be a somewhat cohesive group, it's extremely weird for number ten to go "naw fuck that". They've obviously played in the space before but this is even further out than Catura. It's entirely possible there's a lore reason, like she's a primal and the dragon zodiac doesn't change hands, but just going off design it's real odd. (And even then we've seen an OG zodiac, Basara doesn't stray too far outside the loose design parameters of the rest of them.)
>Hmm I like her design better than Makura, but can't say she'd rank high among the divine generals for me.

Yeah that's where I'm at but fate episodes and (hopeful) event appearances matter a lot.
We got two nickels for getting two black-green haired dragon yay
    I think that there are more examples. Arknights has one or two similar dragon(?)girls I think.
        Maybe its just a typical Chinese dragon color theme haha
Unlikely to be wind, since we got Catura as the wind zodiac for this cycle. The first 6 Zodiacs all had unique elements, and so far none of the last 6 have doubled.
    Oh yeah that's right, we have Andira and Catura. I guess that leaves what, fire, water, earth and dark as possibilities. I am thinking maybe Fire then... my very cursory research on the the general shows that a flaming sword is one of the things they're known for.
It's Haira (*ha-ee-ra*). Cygames draws from the [Twelve Heavenly Generals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_Heavenly_Generals) from the East Asian Buddhism. The original game text uses their Japanese names, while English translation uses variants of their Sanskrit names.
    I knew it was based on the 12 Heavenly Generals but didn't know their whole process for naming them in Japanese and English. So I guess realistically she probably will be Payila and not Haira, or something similar to Payila, at least in English... Payira would be a nice compromise
Lol nah, the metal thingy doesn't cover her nipples, they are supposed to be much lower than that I think, like barely covered by her clothes
Draph women have weird proportions and aren't necessarily as tall as they look.
Then again, it's kind of fitting if what started with Fire (Anila) also ends with Fire (Horse zodiac).
Heyyy I will not tolerate any slander toward Vikala
Tits are one thing but i wish the outfit designs were more cohesive, those seem to go all over the place nowadays.
You apologize to Makura this instant heathen
Kumbhira is when they started messing with the formula, and Cidala is more in line with Vajra than Kumbhira is.
Could be any of Water, Dark or Fire. People are trying to guess her element based on her design but that's never meant anything for Zodiac characters.
Unlikely, we already have 2 winds would be unfair for the other elements, she’s most likely water imo
    Wind should stop being greedy.
    Wind should stop being greedy.
Just an ssr i believe
Sounded like they be normal chars as well as Tyra, i think they announce the grand(s) tommorow.
It's right there in the screenshot...
    As far as I’m concerned it’s just a render for another event involving Lowain and bros for the 5th time
        Be intentionally dumb then idk xDD
            Damn what’s wrong with being cautious over the fact that the render of Lowain and Tyra came just before an event announcement
                They had Lowain's VA stand up on stage and announce that Lowain is finally getting an SSR. You can rest easy now.
                    Fuck yeah
                I don't know what else you think it could be lmao
                    Optimism isn’t a strong suit
                        This isn't optimism, you're just being pessimistic

Optimism = they announced he's getting an alt, surely it'll be broken!

Realism = they said he's getting an alt, so he's getting an alt

Pessimism = they said he's getting an alt, but they must be lying, it def ain't happening
                            Again, it *isn’t* a strong suit
Final banner of the year, last year we got Micheal. So get ready for Grand Lowain Bros
    Nah, the grands getting announced tomorrow
Tyra’s summon being water doesn’t guarantee she will be.
Tyra is already going to be playable, I doubt they would ever release a super limited characters like zodiac as standard unit.
There's already 2 wind Zodiacs. Dark, Water and Fire are the only elements with 1 Zodiac, so Dragon, Snake and Horse are going to be one of those.
Yep flash end of year, tho it will be Lowain bros and a Grand that will be announced on tomorrow livestream
    Thanks!
No. Only available on new year.
Considering she's the yearly Zodiac, unless Cygames suddenly changes the way they've done things for the last 9 years, her banner will be the new year's banner, which will start on the 31st at 12 PM JST.
    Is that how they do it normally? Thanks for the info and nice to know. I assume it'll be around for 2 weeks or so? Hopefully, I can gather enough to spark for her by then. 

Actually, how much do you need for a spark in gbf?
        Banners only stay for a few days. Last year's Zodiac banner, for example, lasted about 4 days. That's a pretty typical length for a banner in GBF.

Sparks need 300 pulls, and there's no other form of pity. That might seem like a lot, but the game is generous enough that you can, if you actively play, spark multiple times a year. And it's advised save up for a spark before doing any pulling, because the rates are... not particularly good.  
As a reference point, for an average rate up character that's just been introduced, you have about 60% chance of getting them during a full spark (300 pulls).

What helps with sparking is that they're doing roulettes twice a year. Roulette is where, every day for the duration of the event, you get to spin a roulette for between 10 and 200 free pulls (don't *expect* 200, but it's certainly possible to hit it). They've added other stuff to roulettes over the years, such as the gachapin bar (fills quicker if you get less pulls; when full, enter Gachapin Frenzy and pull until you get an SSR or 300 pulls), Mukku Frenzy (if your Gachapin Frenzy sucked and was over too quick, high chance of getting a Mukku Frenzy, which is basically the same), free 200 pulls at the end of the roulette (but not on a Gala banner for the winter roulette), or Super Mukku Frenzy (like Gachapin/Mukku Frenzy, but you roll until you get 5 SSRs, and all pulls have increased SSR rates).

By the way. That winter roulette I mentioned? Started today. Might have already seen it. Will run through the duration of the Zodiac banner. Worst case, you'll get 40 or 50 free pulls on it, but it's very likely to be more. Might even get enough free pulls/frenzies for a free spark. Might randomly get the new Zodiac from pulls. You'll have to see!

Also, because it's worth mentioning: Roulette draws reset at a different time than banner changes. You could save up the draws from the day where the Zodiac banner will start and use them on that, and then just use every further roulette roll on that banner, too. Or you could use the roulette draws from that day for the previous banner, which will also be a Gala banner, but with different characters. Up to you.

Oh, also also: As the new yearly Zodiac, she will be on every end-of-month Premium Gala banner up until and including November. She won't have a notable rate-up, but she can be sparked. In case you won't be able to spark her on the new year's banner, you'll have 11 more chances to save up for her. (But after that, she'll take the year off and won't be normally available.)
            >Banners only stay for a few days. Last year's Zodiac banner, for example, lasted about 4 days. That's a pretty typical length for a banner in GBF.

Hmm... Guess I should prioritise finishing the story faster. Sorry for another question, how do I get more of the gacha currency? Just want to cover all my bases.

Think I'll just save that up till she comes out.

So does premium mean only 'bought' gacha currency works? I remember Dragalia Lost had something similar to it, so I assume its the same, since Cygames did run DL as well.
                >Hmm... Guess I should prioritise finishing the story faster. Sorry for another question, how do I get more of the gacha currency? Just want to cover all my bases.

Probably the most important gacha currency, Rainbow Crystals can be gotten in many ways. Doing stories (including main story and side stories) is a good one-time source. The first Fate Episode of every character you get also gives 50 crystals. Trophies (achievements, if you prefer) mostly give crystals, in often smaller amounts, but they're not worth chasing specifically, you'll get them by playing. Currently, there is a login campain that gives you 200 crystals per day. There's freebies from time to time, such as during the three big streams each year... one of which is today/tomorrow, and you should already have 3k crystals in your crate, expecting more tomorrow. The monthly story event comes with crystals in its event-specific draw box (only for the first 20 boxes, coming to 1950 total, I think). Other events usually give crystals. Some eventy have daily missions that give you crystals (such as the current re-run event, The Divine Generals Assembly, which gives you 100 crystals daily for participating in 5 raid battles, can be your own). 

The other important gacha currencies is straight-up tickets. You get them... for doing events, mostly. One here, one there. They just add up over time. There's one you get for every fifth day you log in, too.

There's not really a *premium* currency in GBF. You can't straight-up buy crystals. You can, depending on your login provider, buy mobacoins/granblue coins through them and spend those on pulls. But... at least for mobacoins, those are mobage specific, not GBF specfic.  


>So does premium mean only 'bought' gacha currency works? I remember Dragalia Lost had something similar to it, so I assume its the same, since Cygames did run DL as well.

No, that's just the name they chose for some things. Tickets are officially called "Premium Draw Ticket", but they're just... normal gacha tickets that cannot be bought with money, but can be used on whatever the current banner is.

When I say Premium Gala, I mean the [end-of-month Gala banner](https://gbf.wiki/Draw#Premium_Gala). Sometimes also called Leg Fest, which I believe comes from its japanese name, Legend Fest. Or something.  
It's to distinguish it from Flash Gala, which is the [middle-of-month Gala banner](https://gbf.wiki/Draw#Flash_Gala) (and also sometimes called Flash Fest).

And just to pre-empt the next question: A Gala banner is a banner with double the SSR rate (6% instead of 3%). They happen twice a month\*, they're when new characters are introduced\*\*, and both types of Gala have their own specific pools of units that are always only available/sparkable on their respective Galas. That's pretty important, because those units are Grand units\*\*\*, and Grand units are usually the most desirable units (as are their weapons, if they're not too old). 

The general consensus is to never throw pulls at a non-gala banner. There are exceptions, but those are usually borne out of either desperation, or love. Or both. Or maybe you've got a non-limited character that you really want and it's sparkable at the end of the winter roulette and you've already got 200 pulls + however many from Super Mukku Frenzy for free and you'd only need to spent, like, 30 pulls to finish the spark. Then, I'd consider that acceptable, too.

\* Unless they don't. March, the anniversary month, has a two-part Premium Gala that starts earlier than usual. August used to have that, too. December has a Flash gala in the middle, then another right at the end before the usual Premium gala.  
\*\* Unless they're not There was a time when they introduced so many new characters during summer months that they couldn't fit them all on Gala banners, so they usually had a non-gala banner with new characters... but luckily, they stopped doing that.  
\*\*\* Unless they're not. Zodiacs are also Premium gala exclusives, but they don't follow the same rules as Grands. Instead, you always get the current year's Zodiac available and sparkable on a Premium Gala, as well as one more, rotating through all previous ones. *Except* for the one from the year before, because that one's taking the whole year off.
                    Thank ypu very much for the detailed explanation!!!
If you dont feel confident you can get her this january, she will also be sparkable in end of March banner where we also get a guaranteed 100 rolls from roulette
    Isn't 200 since it is End of roulette? Can somebody who has already done roulette tell me.
    My plan is basically go all in for her in Jan, and if I don't, I'll be saving up for March.
She definitely has a tail I would say, it's just very faintly noticeable behind the flowing cloth, so I think you're onto something with Grea and Filene comparison. EDIT: oh wait, that's just the tail of the dragon behind her :/ WHICH I'm okay with. The thicc af dragon girl tail isn't really my cup of tea lol
LOL. To me she looks like a reskinned Galleon...
A lot, to put it bluntly. Like even if they give two of them a SSR every month I don't think we'd be done in one year.
    I'm trying to think of them just off the top of my head and I keep coming up with more and more. 24 is definitely a low estimate.
Hmm.

She's missing that iconic short Draph height and Draph baby face (wide and short with seemingly chubby cheeks).

But who knows, maybe the character designers got fed up and decided to change everything.
Nope, only that they were common.
If I recall, and I could be wrong, the original Rat was not only female but was considered the leader of the generals.
Don’t have her 🥲

When I say Premium Gala, I mean the [end-of-month Gala banner](https://gbf.wiki/Draw#Premium_Gala). Sometimes also called Leg Fest, which I believe comes from its japanese name, Legend Fest. Or something.  
It's to distinguish it from Flash Gala, which is the [middle-of-month Gala banner](https://gbf.wiki/Draw#Flash_Gala) (and also sometimes called Flash Fest).

And just to pre-empt the next question: A Gala banner is a banner with double the SSR rate (6% instead of 3%). They happen twice a month\*, they're when new characters are introduced\*\*, and both types of Gala have their own specific pools of units that are always only available/sparkable on their respective Galas. That's pretty important, because those units are Grand units\*\*\*, and Grand units are usually the most desirable units (as are their weapons, if they're not too old). 

The general consensus is to never throw pulls at a non-gala banner. There are exceptions, but those are usually borne out of either desperation, or love. Or both. Or maybe you've got a non-limited character that you really want and it's sparkable at the end of the winter roulette and you've already got 200 pulls + however many from Super Mukku Frenzy for free and you'd only need to spent, like, 30 pulls to finish the spark. Then, I'd consider that acceptable, too.

\* Unless they don't. March, the anniversary month, has a two-part Premium Gala that starts earlier than usual. August used to have that, too. December has a Flash gala in the middle, then another right at the end before the usual Premium gala.  
\*\* Unless they're not There was a time when they introduced so many new characters during summer months that they couldn't fit them all on Gala banners, so they usually had a non-gala banner with new characters... but luckily, they stopped doing that.  
\*\*\* Unless they're not. Zodiacs are also Premium gala exclusives, but they don't follow the same rules as Grands. Instead, you always get the current year's Zodiac available and sparkable on a Premium Gala, as well as one more, rotating through all previous ones. *Except* for the one from the year before, because that one's taking the whole year off.
                Thank ypu very much for the detailed explanation!!!
Isn't 200 since it is End of roulette? Can somebody who has already done roulette tell me.
My plan is basically go all in for her in Jan, and if I don't, I'll be saving up for March.
I'm trying to think of them just off the top of my head and I keep coming up with more and more. 24 is definitely a low estimate.
Yeah, or a bad boob job or something. They seem a bit too "buoyant" for their size, even though they tried to give them the appearance of a little sag. Plus the areolae would have to be disproportionally small based on the size of the "windows" through the fabric, which also subtly makes them seem unnatural to me. (Sorry ladies for obsessively picking apart her boobs)
    No that's fine, they just look too perfectly round is unnatural, something that big needs gravity and weight to them, is not the early 2000's anymore, they can do better that sex doll blow up boobage
        Oh yeah, I know all about real boob physics too lol They should be saggier, like Summer Cupitan for example. And I agree, they can do better. Another one that annoys me with that is Hallessena. The Tyra event reminded me how weird hers look.
            Oh draphs tend to go the "round objects attached to chest" aproach super often, specially the ones with old art, Just look at ANY art of Carmelina
                Yeah, I agree about the old art. The majority of newer characters seem to be drawn with more realistic boob physics, which I appreciate as an artist.
Horns, draph ears, big tiddies.
    Grea and Filene also have the same sort of ears, so I'm thinking she may be a Dragonewt
    She seems too tall but the ears are a convincing point.
        Draph proportions are weird sometimes, they are short but their art make their legs long, look at some of Anila’s art and how… normal she looks.
Cupitan's seems less bad in her summer unit since they got a nice shape and sag a little (her normal unit uncap they look like two torpedos).

Haira seems to have a similar head/boobs ratio than Cupitan, but hers is somewhat compressed by her clothes and too round imo
She is Magisa's Size.
Maybe its just a typical Chinese dragon color theme haha
Be intentionally dumb then idk xDD
    Damn what’s wrong with being cautious over the fact that the render of Lowain and Tyra came just before an event announcement
        They had Lowain's VA stand up on stage and announce that Lowain is finally getting an SSR. You can rest easy now.
            Fuck yeah
        I don't know what else you think it could be lmao
            Optimism isn’t a strong suit
                This isn't optimism, you're just being pessimistic

Optimism = they announced he's getting an alt, surely it'll be broken!

Realism = they said he's getting an alt, so he's getting an alt

Pessimism = they said he's getting an alt, but they must be lying, it def ain't happening
                    Again, it *isn’t* a strong suit
Banners only stay for a few days. Last year's Zodiac banner, for example, lasted about 4 days. That's a pretty typical length for a banner in GBF.

Sparks need 300 pulls, and there's no other form of pity. That might seem like a lot, but the game is generous enough that you can, if you actively play, spark multiple times a year. And it's advised save up for a spark before doing any pulling, because the rates are... not particularly good.  
As a reference point, for an average rate up character that's just been introduced, you have about 60% chance of getting them during a full spark (300 pulls).

What helps with sparking is that they're doing roulettes twice a year. Roulette is where, every day for the duration of the event, you get to spin a roulette for between 10 and 200 free pulls (don't *expect* 200, but it's certainly possible to hit it). They've added other stuff to roulettes over the years, such as the gachapin bar (fills quicker if you get less pulls; when full, enter Gachapin Frenzy and pull until you get an SSR or 300 pulls), Mukku Frenzy (if your Gachapin Frenzy sucked and was over too quick, high chance of getting a Mukku Frenzy, which is basically the same), free 200 pulls at the end of the roulette (but not on a Gala banner for the winter roulette), or Super Mukku Frenzy (like Gachapin/Mukku Frenzy, but you roll until you get 5 SSRs, and all pulls have increased SSR rates).

By the way. That winter roulette I mentioned? Started today. Might have already seen it. Will run through the duration of the Zodiac banner. Worst case, you'll get 40 or 50 free pulls on it, but it's very likely to be more. Might even get enough free pulls/frenzies for a free spark. Might randomly get the new Zodiac from pulls. You'll have to see!

Also, because it's worth mentioning: Roulette draws reset at a different time than banner changes. You could save up the draws from the day where the Zodiac banner will start and use them on that, and then just use every further roulette roll on that banner, too. Or you could use the roulette draws from that day for the previous banner, which will also be a Gala banner, but with different characters. Up to you.

Oh, also also: As the new yearly Zodiac, she will be on every end-of-month Premium Gala banner up until and including November. She won't have a notable rate-up, but she can be sparked. In case you won't be able to spark her on the new year's banner, you'll have 11 more chances to save up for her. (But after that, she'll take the year off and won't be normally available.)
    >Banners only stay for a few days. Last year's Zodiac banner, for example, lasted about 4 days. That's a pretty typical length for a banner in GBF.

Hmm... Guess I should prioritise finishing the story faster. Sorry for another question, how do I get more of the gacha currency? Just want to cover all my bases.

Think I'll just save that up till she comes out.

So does premium mean only 'bought' gacha currency works? I remember Dragalia Lost had something similar to it, so I assume its the same, since Cygames did run DL as well.
        >Hmm... Guess I should prioritise finishing the story faster. Sorry for another question, how do I get more of the gacha currency? Just want to cover all my bases.

Probably the most important gacha currency, Rainbow Crystals can be gotten in many ways. Doing stories (including main story and side stories) is a good one-time source. The first Fate Episode of every character you get also gives 50 crystals. Trophies (achievements, if you prefer) mostly give crystals, in often smaller amounts, but they're not worth chasing specifically, you'll get them by playing. Currently, there is a login campain that gives you 200 crystals per day. There's freebies from time to time, such as during the three big streams each year... one of which is today/tomorrow, and you should already have 3k crystals in your crate, expecting more tomorrow. The monthly story event comes with crystals in its event-specific draw box (only for the first 20 boxes, coming to 1950 total, I think). Other events usually give crystals. Some eventy have daily missions that give you crystals (such as the current re-run event, The Divine Generals Assembly, which gives you 100 crystals daily for participating in 5 raid battles, can be your own). 

The other important gacha currencies is straight-up tickets. You get them... for doing events, mostly. One here, one there. They just add up over time. There's one you get for every fifth day you log in, too.

There's not really a *premium* currency in GBF. You can't straight-up buy crystals. You can, depending on your login provider, buy mobacoins/granblue coins through them and spend those on pulls. But... at least for mobacoins, those are mobage specific, not GBF specfic.
