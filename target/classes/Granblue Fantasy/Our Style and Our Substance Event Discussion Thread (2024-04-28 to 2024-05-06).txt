This is a **Token Drawbox** event. 

>The recommended approach for this task is to alternate between hosting the "Very Hard" raids to obtain the materials required for the "Extreme" raid. The latter will reward you with a substential amount of Tokens upon defeat. Additionally, "Extreme" raids have a higher chance of spawning Nightmare solo-battles, which will grant the player 100 Tokens for each successful clear and replenish a few host materials.  
>  
>These multi-battles are suggested due to their relatively low amount of hit points, making it possible to cycle through them quickly. Commonly agreed-upon milestones are 4 Boxes (for Golden Gifts), 10 Boxes (for Damascus Crystals), and 20 Boxes (for Crystals). However, you can choose to clear many more boxes to generate Half-Elixirs and Soul Berries, depending on your specific needs.  
>  
>Typically, acquiring around 750 materials from "Very Hard" raids, along with the additional ones from Honor and Battle Badges, should provide you with enough host materials to acquire the Tokens needed to clear 20 Boxes from Extreme raids and Nightmare battles.  
>  
>As mentionned above, one can make the choice to stop at 4 Boxes and only acquire around 100 host materials. If the goal chosen is only 10 Boxes, then around 300 host materials should be obtained.  
>  
>The first 5 multi-battles of the day cost no AP or host materials. It is recommended to spend them on either "Impossible" or "Extreme" raids to acquire more tokens.

Goofy Draph girls called Lam are consistently good.
    Flair checks out.
That was a pretty dam good event. Like just overall pleasant. It was very much like a coming of age movie. One of the better “casual” events. 

The second raid boss part was so whacky, but I thought it was funny. Imagine you’re watching a movies about the struggles, but also wonders of girlhood and THAT happens.
I give it a solid 9/10. I know they had to somehow throw in a final event boss in there, and as such it felt a bit overblown, but otherwise the characters themselves, consistency in writing and their interaction were superb.
Pretty good side story in my eyes. 

I would be pleased to see Lamouralla and Lilico again. Considering that Lilico is a Ramen critic by the end of this event, I would not be surprised if she may have some interactions with the likes of Ippatsu in the future.

I'm also curious as to where Lodi's character arc will go.
Manamel was definitely the MVP of this event for me. Like DAMN
Very nice event. It doesn't have really high highs, but the quality is consistent and there is nothing major that detracts from the event. The second part kinda elevates it to a pretty good event IMO, because GBF has this tendency to be inconsistent.

Character interactions are written really well. The interactions feel alive, full of personality, and flow relatively naturally. This is purely a guess since GBF doesn't disclose which writer is on the rotation, but I guess they have this guy do all the slice of life events, because while the serious events can be good and can be bad, the SoL ones are consistently pretty good and can even hit amazing (e.g. Mole Troupe). And this guy deserves a raise tbh.

So the new characters are most likely >!Kolulu and Chloe!<. Also the former's new clothes look really cute! I love it. Too bad she's in Earth, one of my least developed elements.
It was a really good, and cute, event. Never been much of a metera's fan, so i've never bothered to check much of her stuff aside her basic lore, but this event made me see her in a different light.

It's nice to see more about some of the horoscopes' cast in a more casual settings. Considering how many characters there are in that series, having events like this focusing on just some of them is great. I always liked that manamel was like a big sister figure for kolulu, in both her fate ep and the previous event, so it was nice to see more of them. This way the next horoscopes' event will hurt more lol.

>!Lodi getting more stuff was also welcome, his relationship with morylin could be interesting given what he thinks of them. I think he's probably the next one to be aweken, on navis' side!<

But the most important piece of lore is definetly that >!erunes' armpit makeup exist lmao!<
Cute event, good mix of old and new characters. Chloe was always a favorite so good on her (hopefully) getting out of SR hell, and congrats to the trash gremlin for getting some real clothes, lol.

Vajra may be my favorite zodiac, but boy is Mahira really gunning for #2.
this event was unhinged. UNHINGED. in the best way possible
> draph horn oil

> erune armpit makeup

now this is lore I can support
Good event! Fun slice of life stuff, some light worldbuilding about fashion differences between races was nice, and the new characters both rule. A small break from the horrors.
Gosh, I've been begging for Earth Kolulu forever.  
I can't believe it's actually happening.  
What an unexpected W today
    Would be hilarious if kolulu turned out to be Earth's exalto unit
    Uh?
        event battle Kolulu was earth, with new skill name, new sprite and new ougi animation. Pretty much confirms a new unit
Really great event. I definitely enjoyed all of the character pairings this time around. Even though there were multiple pairings, the story didn't seem disjointed in the least. Writing was impeccable this time around as well; a lot of substance without feeling too overdone. I especially liked Metera and Utsusemi bully everyone/ Utsu bully Metera. I was funny to see Metera, who's usually the tease in most scenarios, be on the other side of the scale. I found Lams's and Lilico's problems to be interesting all the way up to its conclusion. 

The glowup of Chloe and Kolulu were adorable, as well as Mahira's new(?) outfit, and Metera's white one-piece. Lilico's new outfit wasn't too bad either(not as good as the rest tho). I actually didn't like Lams new outfit over her old one; functionally it was better, but was a bit too simplistic to me.

Also, I'm glad they didn't shoe-in Vyrn and Lyria for this; they are better suited for serious, high-impact stories, but for stories like this, they are very predictable and "safe", and just doesn't add much to the flavor of other characters' personalities. They get enough screen time; let the other chars cook for a bit.

The only thing off, and this is very minor, was when Lilico's dad started twirling his mustache and got in the robot. Not sure how he thought grabbing his daughter and the groom with the robot would help him, but its whatever.
This event started out really funny and Kolulu's initial conversation with Lamouralla in the restaurant absolutely destroyed me. Really enjoyed the humor in this event in general.

The new characters are very fun, I honestly thought Cygames was going to go for an actual lesbian couple for a second until I saw the age gap betwen Lamouralla and Lilico. Their relationship definitely feels more than sisterly lmao.

Everyone was pretty great in this event. Kolulu and Mahira are adorable, Chloe was very entertaining throughout, Utsusemi and Metera's dynamic with each other is really fun as well. Even Siero got some really funny and neat moments in the story. Manamel's initial beef with Lilico was also absolutely hilarious to read. I did think it was interesting how they had the MC/Lyria/Vyrn trio show up for the very start before quickly writing them out by having them be busy with Grandcypher stuff.

The whole premise of the spruce up makes me think of all kinds of wacky roommate scenarios that could happen in the Grandcypher. I feel bad for anyone who has to share a room with Lobelia.

The development with Lodi is also pretty intriguing and it's definitely setting things up for the next proper accordant event, though I did find it a bit weird that Kolulu apparently didn't see him at all. I was hoping she'd have some sort of reaction to him given how she was presented as a bit of a foil to him in Unbound Asterism, but I guess they're leaving that for a more serious event.

Getting a little bit of worldbuilding when it comes to draph and erune fashion was neat. Does make me wonder if the male erune wear something on their exposed areas as well though. Kinda hard to imagine a lot of them caring about it lmao.

Overall, fun and wacky event with plenty of good character moments sprinkled through. A nice little break in the accordant storyline while still having some level of plot development happen. I'm glad I was right about Kolulu finally getting some proper clothes.

Also why was the chapter 3 boss so 3D that was really distracting.
    >though I did find it a bit weird that Kolulu apparently didn't see him at all

I thought they did a pretty good job of never letting her see him, but I don't get how Lamouralla could name drop him and get zero reaction...

WRT Lamouralla and Lilico, what's their age difference? I know it listed all the crew ages but I don't remember theirs. That scene at the end definitely felt real gay, but their journal entries do assert a more familial bond so *shrug*
        Lamouralla is 15 and I believe Lilico is in her 20s
        Lilico is 24 according to the monologue in Chapter 2.
    In regards of Kolulu not seeing Lodi, I do believe one of Nereus' event screen lines has her saying this story takes place BEFORE Unbound Asterism. 
        She says it takes place after the fight at Ovuque Island (which is where Unbound Asterism takes place) but before the cliffhanger where Manamel and Fiorito find Nereus and Judah.
Nereus show up on event page explain timeline is pretty funny to me.

I mean like girl I know you can do forth wall breaking but lol
    Just to clarify, Nereus has an event voice for Chapter 1 where she states "this tale takes place after the battle at Ovuque Island, but before that child reaches me," letting us know that the epilogue of Unbound Asterism hasn't happened yet.
    I didn't even notice that but you're right lol

she's watching us
        Eventually she'll join the Reddit as a mod.
    Hrm? event page explain timeline?
        On the main screen when characters say random stuff like "woah that a lot of tokens", Nereus can show up stating it happens after the latest Horosope event but before Manamel meets her.
A quite wholesome event, really liked Lamouralla and Lilico. [Mad Siero is something](https://imgur.com/a/wYMM669).
    I feared for their lives
    I mean she is the final boss of GBF after all.
God this is so incredible good event.

it SOL event but also low key progress over reaching plot of Horoscope Story too with relationship between Lodi and Lamouralla.

>!Lodi claim that he have absolute no feeling, no hope , no despair but his action in this event quite on contrary even if he didn't notice it (even Nereus notice it as usaul) which mean his weapon will surely awakening soon!<

new Character both are also really good , Lamouralla is really cute in her pursuing of freedom, she would very much get along with Dante ngl lol.

Lilico is also pretty relatable but her feeling of being shallow too awfully close to Lodi thought lol

I just realized that most likely why tell Lodi her that "Freedom is torture to people without ego"

God also Kolulu new outfit is sooooo cute.

also that fucking final boss caught me off guard lmafo. I laugh so hard when I saw them.

This event is purely 9/10 for me lol
Just saying, wanting to go full school lolita dress as your first purchase for style experimentation takes a lot of balls. That stuff's expensive and is not as easy as Mahira's overalls and shirts combo to mix and match with Kolulu's existing wardrobe, but holy crap isn't it cute as hell.

That aside, love the draph horn fashion worldbuilding. I feel obligated to scrutinize their shirt necklines now. Oh, yeah, also like how these girls have their own interpretation of fashion related to their personal expression and the feeling of 'self', corny dialogues aside. It's a nice read!
A much better event than I was expecting. Pretty cute and fun throughout. The only weak part is weak for gameplay related purposes - since that had to toss a second boss in somehow. I won't dock the story for that personally. 


 Guess the new units are >!Dirt Kolulu and SSR Chloe!<
    >! Cya Games: Let us Introduce to you Metera !<
I'm glad we are in agreements let's go girlies!!
And about the 3d boss... I want her sprite. now. I'm literally trying to learn how to sprite so I can keep her as some kinda little floating thing on my computer....!!!

Good luck!
Suddenly… robot!

Suddenl…. MECHA!

this was a decent SOL event, getting to see different characters interact. Looks like Chloe and Kolulu are getting new units?

Also, congrats Kolulu, you Finally got some new threads!
They need to write more events during gas leaks if this is what we get
That twist about Lamouralla's "boyfriends" should have been obvious, but the host club being full of NPC-faces made me second guess myself.
    I realized who these boys are after knowing what Utsusemi and Metera come to this island for lol.
Me: Oh, sweet! It's just gonna be a cute event!

>!Lodi of the Navis: Hello there.!<

Me: >!Aw shit. Here we go again...!<

>!I'm still reading but please stay as a cute event.!<

**Edit:** >!I'm nervous now. I thought we were gonna be safe seeing that this is supposed to take place before "Unbound Asterism".!<

**Edit 2:** It was cute!!
    Apparently it takes place between the end of Unbound Asterism and some of the Epilogues in it
Oh my god, they were roommates.
Easily my favorite story event since the last time we had Kolulu and Manamel star in a story event. Super cute throughout, good humor, yet still good substance for the characters involved. Chloe finally getting her SSR glowup is just the cherry on top; almost certainly suptixing her asap if I don't lucksack her during free draws here. And finally, >!damn Lodi had a great little showing here.!<

Also I now headcanon that Fraux not only applies makeup but scented oils as well to her pits given her hobbies, thanks to how much this event focused on erune armpits.
I'm only a few minutes into this event, not even done the prologue, and I'm already enjoying the entire thing.  
  
The world needs more Lamouralla.
Really enjoyed the event! Surprisingly even with the >!Navis getting involved it stayed pretty uh light. I mean the topic is still pretty heavy, but hey, no kills. I do wonder what Nerues wanted Lodi to do by getting involved with Lam in the first place. To awaken him? It kinda worked in the end, maybe we'll get Kaiju Lodi next.!< 

Also the amount of outfits they debut this time surprised me.   They really said they're gonna be selling those suptixes and scamchas and they meant it. And >!Ms. Heaty!< cracks me up, she'll do well with Cendrillion's original form lol.
    Yeah i think the >!whole lodi deal was just to start his awekening process (and probably to raise founds for Navis). I doubt Nereus would care otherwise, everything she does is always for a reason.!<
so what's the difference between Pasta and Ramen?
    Ramen adds an akaline water to the dough mixture. Apart from that and how they're typically used, they're not too dissimilar.
    Pasta is Italian and ramen is Japanese. Also, ramen is specifically a soup, whereas pasta is generally less specific.
        Like they said in the event, there exists dry ramen known as mazesoba.
    I mean, I'd just call ramen a kind of pasta, or maybe both are a kind of Noodle, if that's how you would categorise it. There's a lot of minute differences, but it's still a flour formed into a noodle shape. It's like asking what's the difference between american grocery store white bread and a fresh piece of naan. Both are bread.
Dirt Kolulu, I wonder if it gonna be new Chloe considering moving R or SR to SSR units.
I had to read this story event because it might had something to do with one of my fav event series marionette star, but turn out this is more wholesome than the last one
This is a very enjoyable and great event to read!

It's a fun SOL story that also has develops characters from the Horoscope story(Lodi), and a suprise full size mecha boss at the end too!

Wonder if this is gonna hint to EX2 mechanic class?
“Who can say what will become of them, or the shopkeepers developing ulcer?”

“Freedom is nothing more than torture to someone without an ego.”

I loved this event so much. Got to see interesting developments for so many characters… Metera especially! I feel like there’s a whole new layer of her character that’s been revealed and I really like it. (Unrelated, but I hope I get even more Sutera in the future.)

So happy to see all the Mahira things and especially the art. She’s the most fascinating and charming General to me, so lucky to have more content. I’m glad to know the chicken will invent the washing machine.

However, the one thing that caught me extremely off guard was the character age reveals. Metera and Kolulu were the only ones that made any sense IMO. Utsusemi seemed a Little young but it could happen… Granblue normally does an excellent job at matching characters designs and personalities with age, idk wtf they thought with some of these. 💀
    They haven't really revealed anyone's age in this (outside of Lilico and Lamouralla), they've been known since each character got released. I didn't think any of them felt all that out of place either.
        Really? I’ve been playing for 5 years and don’t recall seeing ages on a single character from this event before 😅 I guess I haven’t been paying attention, jeez… good to know! Was this info on other side stories, or do you have to Google these sorts of things?
            Whenever a characther gets launched there's a post in twitter with their heigh, age, hobby, likes and dislikes. Sometimes age gets sidesteped (mostly primals and other long lived individuals), but with more down to earth characthers it's always there
                **What..** How in gods name did I miss this. 😭 That’s amazing!!!

Thanks for letting me know, I absolutely love that kind of stuff. I can’t wait to go through their posts and look for my fav characters… but istg if the majority of the cast is actually just teenagers I’m gonna have a lot of questions 💀💀💀 they better not tell me Rackam is any younger than like 30 😭 LMAO
-slams desk-

Your honor, they're married.

In all seriousness though, for a lighthearted silly event there was a lot of heart. A little cliche but the character interactions were a lot of fun and earnest so who cares if you're smiling at it the whole way through
Well The story already show 2 new skin for existing character.(Earth/dark)

Leg fest may not be safe
Love it, just great character interactions throughout the whole thing.
Preview said new Chloe

Event itself said they're doing a >!Metera!< eventually

I hope Chloe just comes home on her own soon since I have to pinch for that second one if it actually happens sooner or later
    Metera looks more like it was drawn over her Summer.
        Damn you're right.

there was enough different compared to the usual drawovers I didn't even think about it at first, but that might be it
Such a good event
wtf they held hands

lewd
>Why is the mecha even a boss?

Dad Villain burned a lot of cash powering it up because he felt like it

It was fun, and also an indication he does have things in common with Lilico after all that

Still an asshole
This event was such a cute amazing event, I loved it so much. Highlight for me was definitely Utsusemi x Metera yuri and the character interactions in general. Final boss felt a bit forced but… I mean it wasn’t really bad enough to warrant a negative comment over all the other good things.
An earlier comment brought up the interesting and hilarious question of who would be the worst crewmember to have as a roommate (whether its temporary or permament)? Either generally, specifically to you or to your favourite character.
I just finished the intro.

I already love Lamouralla.

*Please don't kill her off Cygames.*
It's getting late and other stuff got in the way of me finishing the event story, just unlocked the first boss and then did the daily mission, but..... I was caught off-guard.

*A 3D boss!*
Flair checks out.
Would be hilarious if kolulu turned out to be Earth's exalto unit
Uh?
    event battle Kolulu was earth, with new skill name, new sprite and new ougi animation. Pretty much confirms a new unit
