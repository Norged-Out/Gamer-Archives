[[You're KICKED out from Bazaar between time!]]





Why is kjaros better than runalds? In your opinion

Edit: for me the reason is aoe
    I like it because it has cool flame tornado â™ª(Â´â–½ï½€)
    i like runalds more but i cannot lie kjaros be putting in work with that guaranteed phase 4 skip ðŸ«¦ðŸ«¦
        what
            You can skip Phase 4 of the Mithrix fight if you kill him on Phase 3, in the center, with a hit that triggers your fire band ðŸ¤™
                Ohhhh neat, thanks
            There is a tech called boss skipping in the game. 

It works by hitting various "boss" enemies with certain attacks in the first frame that they spawn.

The main methods to do it are kjarro's band and the shuriken, though there are many other harder variations. 

This doesn't kill the bosses outright, but strips their "boss" trait, triggering various effects before the enemy itself dies. On teleporter bosses, this lets you complete the charge without killing them. On alloy worship unit, this drops the red instantly without killing it. On phase 4 mithrix, this stops him from stealing items and doing that animation, letting you kill him quickly and leave.

                It doesnâ€™t stop him from stealing items when you skip phase 4, it kills him.
                    Sorry, but this is simply incorrect. He does probably die fast from all your items, but not instantly. He also doesn't steal items. You're welcome to look up a video of it if you want proof
                        My bad I just double checked youâ€™re right
captains microbots cannot block water guns. we need captain buffs asap bros
based desperado enjoyer
Last time I dps tested on newt I had 200 seers lens and I instantly obliterated him...
    Does something different happen if he dies?
        He leaves, you have free reign, he just doesn't kick you out, as he is dead.
            Huh, neat.
Omg the kid-survivors are so freaking adorable!
very based man

edit: or woman, I donâ€™t know, youâ€™re a dude now
    "IT'S MA'AM"
A fellow Daisey enjoyerâ€¦ finally
bruh lepton daisy
    you take the lepton daisy because you need green scrap.

but i take lepton just to make my teleport prettier. (âœ¿â—¡â€¿â—¡)

we are not the same.
        we are not the same but i now respect your choice
        I tip my hat to you one legend to another
Why does Captain wear a cute little pink apron?
    Why donâ€™t you?
captain just raising the other members (no robots nor void fiend) is just so cute lol.
Iâ€™ve never been kicked out and I have zeroâ€™d his health
I see thereâ€™s at least one other Fireworks stan out there - thank you
Shaped glass my beloved. I've never not taken you. (I play command artifact and always pick shaped glass)
Love the comics, you could say they're my favovites *looks at camera*. Jokes aside great job mate lmao
MOST OF THE ART IS NOT RELATED TO THE TITLE BUT I DON'T CARE XD
Bullshit blind pest
Lepton daisy. cringe
    yes, i am cringe but i am free (âœ¿â—¡â€¿â—¡)
    Cringe is when insulting people for their way to play this game. So it's you cringe rn
I did so much damage one of my runs as bandit I didnâ€™t get kicked out
Top 3 Greens
"Oh nice, kjaros. Definitely can see it being in almost anyone's top 3.
Feather? It's definitely a cool item, I see no issue.
I wonder what the last one could b-
LEPTON WHAT"
...lepton daisy?

EDIT: It does make it prettier
Thereâ€¦ there are people who LIKE lepton daisy? I groan every time I see it
Pretty sure the slide with captain at the store is accurate as far as ages are concerned, seeing as heâ€™s a retired veteran iirc
Fireworks and daisy are very interesting fans.
Insta kill works on that newt.
Entire team is still babies! (And itâ€™s very silly :))
Where my boy Rex at?
Ah yes the anime girl dressed as everyoneâ€™s favorite rootin tootin backstab n shootin bandit

(Also you should try modded ror if not for the simple fact that you can buff lepton daisy to also cleanse on the pulse)
My god i love the 4th image
