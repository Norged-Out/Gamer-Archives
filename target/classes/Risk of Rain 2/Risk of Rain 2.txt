[[Risk of Rain 2]]





Have you played the original Risk of rain? Still can't believe they managed to make the transition from 2d to 3d quite so well.
    [EDIT](https://i.imgur.com/fONgwnE.png)
        I'd like the 3d reply please
            We'll have to wait for Reddit 2
                Or JrGrafo.
                    Isnt SrGrafo short for Señor Grafo, or is it senior
                        I always read it in my head as “sir grafo”
                            Am I the only one who read it as Sargeant Graph I?
                                Yes
                        I'm not sure tbh. I was just making a silly joke. We would have to ask the man himself for clarification.
                            Calling user u/srgrafo for clarification
                        I always thought dude was a Brit and its "Sir Grafo"
                        Psure its sir
                        Makes me think of Señor Senior Sr from Kim Possible
                        He's portuguese, so it's "senhor grafo". Here we abreviate it like this, senhor (portuguese for mister) to sr, like you do it from mister to mr.
                    SrGrafoJr
        Might be late to catch your attention in this random reply, but I've been really loving the mods for risk of rain 2. The Goku one (yes, dbz) is incredibly well made and there's another mod that creates random character classes to pick by mixing up models and abilities. 

For example, played one yesterday that let me walk around as the giant crawling oil pot and my abilities were (1) some fireball with 33 shots before cool down, (2) some slow moving projectile that exploded on contact, (3) self damaging ability that shot me backwards, (4) summon up to 3 crawling turrets. 

It's pretty epic.

--edit: mods are at https://thunderstore.io/ and the mod manager from there handles dependencies and things
            I'm gonna need to check that out. That second mod sounds insanely cool
                u/undeleteparent
                There's somewhere in the config you can set a seed so you can generate the same heroes every time if you want to play multiplayer with them, otherwise it's random every time the game starts up. It's pretty cool and some are broken bad or broken good. The one I tried there was probably the most powerful one, but some what balanced by being big and slow. 

The replay value in that mod is hard to put to words :)
                    Is there a name for the mod that I can look for?
            Oh there’s workshop capability now? I haven’t played since it came out
                er, no - I'll edit the mod site into my first reply because it's neither steam nor the usual nexus. It's  [https://thunderstore.io/](https://thunderstore.io/)  and the mod manager from there handles it all :)
                    Oh awesome I’m gonna have to do that! Saw a video and it looks super easy
                        I'm using the random survivors mod and the goku mod. Both are awesome and work together despite warnings in the random mod that specific character mods may cause issues. Random survivors pretty much takes care of the content ever becoming stale since it creates a random set every time the game is launched. The goku mod is still worth checking out though because it is so well made - the model, the voice lines, the additional systems (transformations, energy meter, power level, etc). 

It's the most fun dbz gaming experience I've had and it's just a mod for another game.
                            you just awakened my dbz flame again bro. Its been a while since playing some DBFZ or some budokai lol im definitely doing it tonight
                                Just be sure to adjust his loadout. I prefer meteor crash to ki blast and charge to instant transmission. Using charge to scream raise your energy is the most DBZ thing ever. I believe the transformations go all the way up to kaioken x20 and super saiyan blue, both active at the same time lol.

Just read up carefully on the mechanics so you use 'em all and it's like.. damn, why can't regular dbz games be this good?
            I have not tried any of those, but now I gotta O\_o
                Goku has voicelines and additional mechanics. He's got a power level which lets you transform into various super saiyan and kaioken forms. He's also got loadouts so you can choose between things like kamehameha or spirit bomb. Oh and he can fly :P It's probably the best *dbz*  gameplay I've experienced and it's just a ROR mod lol
                    Is it a steam community mod or nexxus or what?

:o
                        I edited it into my original reply. The risk of rain community seems to have their own website which is neither the steam workshop nor the usual nexus mod site. They've got  [https://thunderstore.io/](https://thunderstore.io/) and you're looking for something called RoR2ModManager by scottbot95. 

I grew up with mods and it's been rough since MW2 where modding more or less officially died for AAA games so more DLC can be sold / games die faster so more sequels can be made. Or undying shit like GTA V.
                            Oh I love modding, and I don't mind mod managers at all. I'd just never known about any that existed for RoR. I'm exiteeeed :D
                                It's the perfect game for them :) there's an api mod for RoR as well if you decide to try and make one. That goku one is very inspiring.
        How many edits have you made that can be taken so far out of context?
        Their only mistake was not leaving anything for Risk of Rain 3. They're out of dimensions!
            ... But they can make it VR. Oooooh.
                Now there's an idea!
        This panel needs to be a reusable reaction. 😂
    Yeah this is why I haven't played 2. Sounds like it's good. RoR is awesome but so fucking hard. & That's coming from a Dead Cells punishment glutton.
        RoR was hard as fuck. RoR 2 is also hard, but in a more managable, steadily increasing fashion. You should play it.  


Matter of fact, if you (AND ONLY YOU, DANG IT.) reply to this message, I'll send you a steam code.
            Damn what!? That's a deal! Fuckin gamers man.. the best people ever. I absolutely promise I will play it.. given this super effective recommendation.

UPDATE: played all last night. it's phenomenal. I'll be paying this forward on u/Nytohan 's new sub r/PayItForwardGaming . Hey u/SrGrafo is there anyone in this thread that you think deserves to be surprised w/ a steam code?
                [removed]
                    UPDATE: registered and installed!! Can not wait to play this after work. You, my friend, earned more than just internet karma today. Thank you!
                        Sounds like someone just made a friend. That's heartwarming... I'm leaving the internet for today so it can't destroy the faith in humanity I just gained.
                            Hey, you go have an excellent day.
                        [deleted]
                            Ah shit you find me on steam? Wait is there online multiplayer or am I wooshing right now? (Steam username is same)
                    Just letting you know, you sold a copy based on this as well.  If you like it enough to give it to an internet stranger, then that's a good enough recommend for me, and I bought it immediately.
                        Oh god, that's more pressure than I was expecting.

I hope you like the game!
                            G'wan  git, ya heartwarmin' fucks.
                                The influence is strong today. This is good influence though, not social media influence. Wait, this is a form of social media. Shit.
                                    Sr Grafo is an influencer!
                            If it makes you feel better, I read this series of comments and immediately went and bought it then immediately returned it, stating "Nytohan can't be trusted" as my reason.
                                I mean... that's not UNTRUE.
                            i own the game as well and just wanted to put my 2 cents in that i love it as well. have fun guys!
                            Honestly that went double for me. I get off work in 12 hours and I'm gonna be picking it up too. Let's do this shit.
                    The gaming community is great sometimes
                        Yeah that’s a huge sometimes.
                    You know what, because you're a cool dude I'll buy the game as soon as I can.

People like you are why I love the gaming community.
                    What a legend. God, The Last Of Us subreddit could use a dose of this kindness right now.
                        Last of us subreddit is a reflection of the game, people tearing eachothers appart
                Fuckin *gamers* man. Fun fact, I got Fallout: NV in a similar way to this.
                    Is New Vegas any good?
                        Fantastic. The base game can go as low as $3 during sales and I’ve never had more fun patrolling the Mojave
                        I think I’ve put close to 1000 hours into the game across 3 consoles and multiple play throughs, it’s my favorite fallout game
                        Yeah. It's great. Not without bugs... but just great. I am actually replaying it now.
                    I had someone gift me Oxygen Not Included in a similar way, too
                Would be fun if you liked it, and only if you really liked it, to also gift a key to semeone else, and if that person also likes it to gift it to another person, etc, etc
                    Hey, I like this idea. A lot. Just set up a subreddit, /r/PayItForwardGaming.  
Need to set up how it works and all, but maybe this can be a thing.
            🏅 here’s a poor mans gold
                It's so much more meaningful because you made it yourself.
            I didn't expect to come across something so wholesome while reading Reddit, but here we are.
                "Be excellent to each other." -  *Bill S*. *Preston*, *Esq*.
            Risk of Rain was hard until you got the modifier that lets you pick what upgrade you want everytime you pick one up.  Once you know which upgrade is which and how effective they are, it's a relative cakewalk depending on what character you pick.  Some of them feel completely helpless solo.  Hit speed, leech on hit and leech on kill, overall HP increases... stuff like that turns you into a tank in no time and from there you pick stuff that ups damage either directly or indirectly.  Chef with that stuff is practically invincible from the crazy amounts of leech on hit.  I love watching like 30 homing rockets shoot out into the sky and rain down on enemies every time I open a chest.
            I haven't played either one, which should I play first?
                Honestly, Risk of Rain didn't grab me like RoR 2, but go check out some videos. We all have our own preferences!
                There isn't really an important continuity to it. There IS a bit of story behind it all in the Dark Souls way. But like Dark Souls, playing them in any order won't really change your experience of it.  


It really comes down to which you enjoy more, 2D or 3D. Some people find one or the other much harder to grapple with.
                If you like 2D platformers, the original is good fun. If you're more into 3D shooters, then RoR2 is fantastic.
            Take this platinum and get out of here you beautiful bastard you.
                Why anyone would spend money on an internet stranger is beyond me, but thank you! :)
            Codes or it didn't happen...
                I mean, I can give you the now used steam code...
        As someone who played ror2 before the first game, the first game is way harder to get into I feel. I've never been good at 2d combat games like terraria or starbound though so that may explain why the easiest difficulty in the first game felt like the hardest difficulty in the second game to me. An important thing to note, there are difficulty levels life the first game and the hardest difficulty level is only required for cosmetic "mastery" skins for each character.
            I tried 1 first and I just couldn't get the hang of controlling a character the size of like 4 pixels, I could barely last 5 minutes.  I was able to play for over 90 minutes first run on 2.
        I loved risk of rain, but found the second one to be too hard.

I'm a pretty casual gamer though. I just sucked at the 3d movement.
            God I'm the exact opposite. So many years of playing RoR1, RoR2 feels stupid easy in comparison. I'm good at shooters though so that might be it.
                Yeah I suck at shooters.
                    You should play the huntress then. She's really good for people who aren't great at 3d shooting.
                It's so much harder to dodge in RoR2 though. In 1 you just need to jump, in 2 the enemies have aimbots that are always targeting you so you need to either kill them or get behind something to avoid them.
                    It's really mostly lesser wisps, to be honest. No other enemy in the game has a body count near as high, I'm sure of it.
                        I found that its just because the game is balanced to prevent god runs more. They still happen but you're more likely to die before you can get a build that is truly unkilleable.
                        Even when you’re not running Shaped Glass, the bastards will kill you. Especially Blazing ones.
                    The trick is positioning, movement, and prioritizing wisps until you have will'o'wisps or some ukuleles. You should always be moving to place the enemy at your maximum engagement range and minimizing how surrounded you are, merc has iframes to deal and loader should be moving in and out quickly. Fighting under a hoard of wisps is a great way to eat shit. These days I mostly play with Artifact of Glass, so I might be biased, but it's always better to move to a more advantageous spot than brawl it out.
            Shit I'm out then. Same thing happened to me and Hotline Miami 2. If I can't actually finish a game it just haunts me.
                Be like me and just play with command, and try and do wacky things. I have never looped a monsoon without it, but ill keep trying. Until then ill keep messing around and having fun with command.
                Well there is no beating Risk of Rain 2, it just keeps getting harder til you lose. (There are difficulty settings for how fast it ramps up).
                    There is technically ways to "win". Gotta get through the blue portal.
                        Celestial portal, I think blue goes to the friendly lizard wizard
                I got 99.9% completion on Spyro when I was a kid, all I had left was one dragon and a few gems in the Treetops level which I kept struggling to reach. One day my memory card was full and I accidentally deleted the save freeing up space for another game.

More recently I picked up Spyro: Reignited but I still never managed to get to that platform on Treetops, and I don't play PS4 much these days anyway.
                Argh man that army camp level still gives me nightmares. Stick with it though you'll do it.
        Have you tried nuclear throne?
            Nah but my buddy has it in our family share dealio.. what's up with it?
                I've never beat it. I've beat every rouge lite I play, but not nuclear throne.
        It depends on if you play with the seals or not. There are some insanely fun combinations. Being able to pick items, then eventually ramp up to unlimited use items is really fun. Especially when one of the use items gives you more items so you can destroy everything.

I definitely have not spent 4 hours in 1 game just ramping items so I can beat the boss instantly with barbed wire by existing.
        What you think of Dark Souls? (Any)
        RoR2 gets me to a point of being unkillable more often than RoR did. Even then though, I will still eventually die, even if it take three hours.
        I am not a fan. Tried it for a few hours, but it does not click.
    Bro, I was SO skeptical. I thought they were gonna ruin the original feel of the game but they NAILED it.
        I haven't played it yet but I'm hoping the soundtrack is as good as the first one. They brought back the same guy so I hope it is. He also did some great work on Deadbolt, another 2D game by the same studio.
            Yes! Chris is an amazing artist. The music in 2 SLAPS my guy. It is just as top tier as 1, with some motifs and nods to it as well. I played deadbolt just to hear his music! He’s truly wonderful.
As a risk of rain 2 player I can’t help but recommend it.
    [EDIT](https://i.imgur.com/zDYvFOq.png)
        Haven't played 2 but Risk of Rain 1 is also really really good, albeit pretty different from 2
            Ror2 is literally ror1 but in a 3d world. If you enjoy ror1 I highly recommend ror2. Just keep in mind it's moderately early Access, so it's not perfectly fleshed out. There are also changes to certain items and stuff.

Oh god what did I start here.
                The next update will be the end of early access. I think it's dropping soon.

*Spelling
                    Bought it day one, played a few hours and decided to wait until it is out of early access.  Still was tons of fun tho.
                        Its a ton of fun, but it takes forever to unlock characters. Its also not clear how to unlock them all.
                            Well I mean they are hidden on purpose.
                            i would say you're good to go ahead and look up how to unlock them - the first few characters i unlocked just by playing the game in my first 7 or so runs i reckon.  


once you get into it, you'd have to actively avoid working out/finding out how to unlock the characters.  


the artifacts however... wow there's a bit of a puzzle and also a lot of work.
                            Exactly like RoR1. Great series.
                            Google makes it very clear. And if it still too difficult I recommend using mods once to unlock new characters. I agree they need to do better with explaining how to unlock them though.
                            [deleted]
                                Thats a great idea!
                            I find it super difficult!!
                            I just edited my save to unlock all the characters. I told my friends to do the same. The game's more fun when you find a character you like. That first one (? I don't remember) and Huntress are fine and all but imo, are among the most boring characters. They might be your only characters after 5 hours of play too if you're doing things blind.
                            It is **pretty** clear. I've owned it for write some time. Maybe you didn't look in the logs?
                        I've been playing on/off since day one and I must say, go ahead and pick it back up, it's loads and loads of fun. And you'll definitely see the love that's gone in to it. Especially if you played 1 :)
                        yeah, I loved 1 and bought 2 just to re-reward the developers. I fully expected the move to 3D to ruin it.

Played a few hours at the beginning of Early Access and was really surprised at how well the mechanics translated. Then I put it down because it's worth waiting for fewer bugs and more features.

Basically, it's the poster child for how Early Access should work.
                    August
                    August is 1.0.
                    What's the status on difficulty?  I played a ton when it first dropped and had a great time, then the update dropped that retooled difficulty and it was suddenly absolutely crushingly hard.  Like an order of magnitude more difficult, even at the normal difficulty.

Have they balanced that out at all?  My friends and I were getting absolutely demolished, to the point where it was a lot less fun compared to when it first launched.
                    August is the 1.0 release, I'm really excited
                    Sounds like a possibility of a sale! Hopefully there's a sale on switch too

            Very different. It's also pretty fun from the time I've had playing it. If you prefer a third person shooter then it's your game. Wisps are also deadlier somehow...
                It's different... While being the exact same game somehow
                    Yes, which is why it's one of my highly recommended games as well. The only game I know of with a better 2D->3D jump was GTA.
            Nah, my biggest gripe with ROR2 is that it's literally just ROR1 but 3d which, IMO, hurts the experience. I enjoyed 1 a far deal greater because it's very difficult to wrap your head around enemies coming at you from 360°.

But that's just preferences on my part. It's still a very good game.

(but seriously his entire Deadbolt OST is imo better than most of the RoR OSTs, you really need to listen to it)

This man needs more games. He's got a wealth of talent.
        Damn, the rain previously known as purple is a stunningly beautiful track.
            Great name too
                Not a very subtle reference to Purple Rain by Prince, I love it

Purple Rain guitar solo is in there too
        The music is what really got me into the game. It has excellent gameplay, but combined with the OST and it's one of those games you just love to sit down a waste a couple hours playing.
            My only complaint is that it absolutely devours time.
                Me: I'll just do a quick run on easy and screw around. 

137 minutes into the run: fuk.
                i just wish there was a functionality to save mid run and continue at another time
                    There are so many mods, check it out, saves you at the start of each stage.

                I did an endless run in RoR1 that lasted about 20 hours. I put on the cheat to pick my drops and wanted to see just how OP I could get. Turns out you can be pretty much invincible.
            9PM: I'll just play a quick game of RoR2 before bed

2:35AM: fuck
        Oh yeah the music is a solid 10/10
        When I booted up Risk of rain 2, years after playing risk of rain 1 (and loving it), the menu music gave me chills
        Check out Iji and Chris Geehan. How that was released for free just absolutely blows my mind. 

[It's a slow burn. Let it simmer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c0Ha-O09aY)

Better yet, play the game. It's better with context.
            Oh hey, amusing to run across this as I am listening to a [remix of Tor's theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CBOU-42eJE)
                I must assume you're a pretty rad person.
        This dude is a mad genius. The unusual time signatures, the weird and wavy instruments, the funky beats and not to mention the incredible keyboard melodies that sometimes sounds like he just rolls his hands across the keyboard. It's perfection
    So much chaos on one screen
        And I love it.
    I bought it day one, but haven't played in over a year.

I really do need to get back into it one of these days.
        I highly recommend you do. They have added tons of secrets and new characters in that time.
            Yeah part of why I decided to wait awhile was so that I could play through a ton of new content, instead of just playing through new content as it came out and potentially getting bored.

I wanted it to feel more like the original when I played that, where there was already most of the game in place.
                If you want a huge change, somebody upthread said that they are working on the "out of early access" patch, so it might be worth checking their blog or whatever -- if you've already waited a year, a month or so might not be a big wait (I know nothing about their timeline, it is just a thought). 

OTOH they did add many of the classic artifacts from 1, so there's definitely enough new stuff to play through.
    HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
        People be downvotin, but rest assured the players of this game understand you.

And we feel your pain.
            The worst thing with the game is that if you don't die, your PC will eventually.
                Yup, crashed game at 4:30:00 in and 4:35:00 so its a fine line apparently lol
            Looks like people in the know corrected that one quick.
        *TFW you’re two hours into a run and the trash enemies are being replaced by bosses*
        Are you Tidus?
        I'M COMING
    i literally just bought risk of rain 2 because of this thread
    It's been a journey watching it grow
    Your bustling fungus hand it over
        Darn engineers stealing all the fungus.
            Who else do you want to have it? The artificer?
    Does this game of perm death?
        Yes but there is a rare item that gives you an extra life. The game is about getting as far as you can.
            I always forget I have one of those. Whenever I get revived I instantly die again.
        it's a "rogue lite". if you're not familiar with the genre there is random loot, perma-death, and no saving. But you can complete achievements to unlock more types of loot and characters.
        Yes. The gameplay consists of gaining items to make your character more powerful while the difficulty increases every second. It's not a game you can really win. The challenge is to see how far you can go.
    Did they ever fix that thing where in order to get new skills to cycle out you need to play in a completely stupid way with a character that may or may not pan out based upon the RNG you get for that current game?

I love playing Risk of Rain 2 whenever my brother comes into town. We sit on the couch and will play for hours upon hours. But it always really annoyed me that there was no real progression for my character unless I wanted to take a few hours to do something dumb with no real achievement.
        The whole progression of the game is to unlock more stuff for the next run. It's part of the rougelike experience.
            I mean I understand the rogue like mechanics but the idea of unlocking is fairly limited in RoR. Not all higher tier skills are more viable than the base skills and there are a few separate classes to unlock. 

I enjoy the game. 

I like it a lot. 

I think it has really sweet coop for couch playing. 

I just never found their idea of progression to be very interesting or fun.
                Fair enough, haven't really tested it out lately so I haven't really checked out the newest stuff. Had a blast when it came out but even then it was some stuff that was a bit grindy/hard to unlock without external help.
                    I just used this website. https://tbfts.github.io/ror2_save_editor/ to edit my save and give me all unlocks.

It's a roguelike so you still need to get lucky to have a good playthrough but with everything unlocked at least you know all items and abilities are available to you during your run.
    It’s a solid game.
    Same it’s honestly one of the best games I’ve played in a while, mostly for its replayaility
    How do I not suck on normal difficulty?
Risk of Rain, huh?

That's the current weather for me
    [EDIT](https://i.imgur.com/SyvmgeX.png)
        Fake advertisement, count me out!

No need for lies.
            No rain, just the constant risk that there might be some
                Sounds like the average summer day where I live
                    A fellow Brit I see.
                        Central Canada actually. Usually we don’t get too much rain but the last month has been really stormy and there has been a risk of rain almost every single day. Sucks too because I’ve been wanting to go in my pool for like a week now but haven’t gotten much of a chance.
                            Just go into your pool anyway. After all if it rains you're already wet.
                                Is it weird that I like swimming in the rain more than swimming in bright sunshine? Just something about it.
                        It was so weird for me to move to England and find out it actually rains more in my home country!

I feel lied to
                If there's none then there's no risk
        Wait no rain? That IS a deal-breaker... Wait I already have the original Risk of Rain in my Steam library...
            to be fair it is called risk of rain not currently raining
                So... Tease of Rain?  Blue Rain Balls?  Rain That's Out Of Your League And You're Never Going To Get It And Both You And The Rain Know It But You Play Anyway?
                    That last ones an r/suspiciouslyspecific from me
            It's got a whole extra dimension in it.
        It's not about the rain, it's about the RISK of rain. It's a game about the constant anxiety of wondering whether you should have worn a coat, or if you'll be ok without one.

A summary of life, living in the Pacific NW.
            Wait that's actually true.

The whole game is the anxiety of: "Should I hunt for more items or just activate the tele and get the fuck outta here before The Director screws me over".

Never thought of it like that before.
        There is but only on one level. Kind pf a deal breaker. /s
            Actually there can be rain in every level. You just have to play as Huntress.

Huntress has an ability called "Arrow **Rain**".
        NOOOOOOoooooooooooooooo. The first game had rain! They should rename it to Risk of Nice Daytime Stroll Wherein Monsters May or May Not Spawn Endlessly.
            To be fair, the "rain" was all the ship parts breaking up and landing on the planet. How else would you finding Electric Ukeleles. "And his music was electric."
            It's only the penultimate in the series. Expectation of Rain, Risk of Rain, and finally Relentless Rain
        You bought me

        Actually it is raining lightly in one of the levels

    shit you live in maryland too?
        Uh, no. Poland says hello though
Such a strange name for a game. What is the risk of rain in the game? Is it acid rain? Time rain?

        Huntress' "Arrow Rain" ability: "Am I a joke to you?"
            Laughs in Ballista.
                that's why it's a risk, it's uncertain.
            When I play as Artificer, I'd say there's a risk of meteor showers with the occasional ball lightning from above.
            Actually yes. Ballista is the better pick 100% of the time.
        If i recall the devs mentioned somewhere that the title is a reference to the cargo ship exploding over whatever planet you're on raining down all the cargo and items you find
            Thank you, I'm so glad you mentioned that! I always assumed that's what the title was referencing, but I never saw that from the devs, and nobody else seemed to make the connection, so I thought maybe it was just me!
            You just exploded my fucking brain , compadre
            Wtf spoilers now there's no point in playing
            Played 1 and 2 and always knew this too so +1
        The username change, I liked that.
            I wonder if /u/AngryMeerkat actually exists.

They do but haven't done anything in years.
                And their only post and comment is about ball pits haha
                    Well? Does anyone have an answer to his question?
                        Must be why s/he quit posting in reddit.
        There is rain Grafo, you just raining down damage!!
        Ha, angrymeerkat
    Basically, you go from map-to-map killing enemies and buying stackable bonuses (i.e attack speed or X happens on kill). Every map has a portal which spawns a boss, you kill the boss and hold the point for X time, then you can go to the next map to rinse and repeat.. As time goes on enemies get harder and spawn in greater numbers. You can rush towards the next level, or take your time to get cash and purchase everything on the current map, but you're risking getting "washed out" by the "flood" of enemies.
        So.... Gauntlet?
            Oh God, I haven't played that in ages lol, but it's definitely along those lines.
                Nothing beats Gauntlet Legends though
                    Except, of course, Gauntlet: Dark Legacy
                        I found a copy of that for like 2 bucks at a garage sale for the ps2. I had previously owned it on xbox but had long since lost it. I still remembered where every secret was and my SO was getting annoyed because she was completely lost. Still super fun.
                    Blue JESTER...is about to die..
                        Sometimes when I'm hungry I hear a voice in my head "Red warrior needs food badly."
    In terms of rain, there is no rain. 

(Try it out anyway)
    It may not be the actual reason, but in the beginning of the first game a cargo ship is destroyed above a planet and countless random crates rain down onto it. I always figured that was it.
    I think its a metaphor
    I haven't played 2, but I played the first quite a bit. The devs are based in Seattle, and it's half a nod to the overwhelming numbers of enemies you face (I think), and half a nod to Seattle's weather.
    It's based off where the devs live. The devs said the name comes from living in Seattle. Considering in Seattle, it's usually always raining. Hence, Risk of Rain.
        Man I always thought it was pretty clearly referring to what little story there was in the game. The chests and pods you find everywhere having rained down >!in the wreckage of the ship you escape in in the final level!<. But if the devs say it's just a weather joke, then color me unimpressed.

Still a fantastic game, of course.
    It’s raining projectiles. And deaths.
    From Wikipedia 
 > The title Risk of Rain was selected not only to allow the game to be easily searchable via the Internet, but came to allude to the concept of a single protagonist in the large game world always worried about "a risk of failure or bad things happening".[2]
So you're being sponsored by risk of rain 2?
    [EDIT](https://i.imgur.com/BueaSAt.png)
        Risk of Rain 2 would be a sweet sponsorship.


Instead we're stuck with YouTubers sponsored by **Raid: Shadow Legends** (Try it on the app store today!)


^(this message brought to you by Raid: Shadow Legends)
            Well see here’s the thing, 

Raid shadow Legends isn’t a game. It’s an app that slowly tempts small minded people to give them money, for no reason. They barely have to spend a dime on the “game” itself, so they can pump out thousands in advertising.

Risk of Rain 2 is an actual video game with actual stuff to do and actual gameplay. A smaller game developer can’t do that because if they want their game to succeed, they have to do the right things and implement certain things to make it fun. Then people will buy it and then you’ve made your paycheck for the game. (Only considering smaller studios)
                Hopoo games is actually a very small team. The first game, as well as ROR2's early access build and first few updates were made by a 3 person dev team.
                    Right, but Raid Shadow Legends isn’t an actual video game though. So they don’t really have much work to do. That’s what I’m getting at. 

RoR2 has a good dev team that brings us a good game. They deserve the price point for purchasing the game. 

Raid Shadow Legends is malware.
                        Oh, I'm an idiot and misread your first comment as the opposite of what you were saying. Yeah I totally agree with everything you said. Well put bud
                            Haha no problem dude, I figured you meant that! Hopefully what I said didn’t get conveyed as being as asshole, didn’t mean for that! 

Edit: outside of shitting on that trash heap of a “game”.

Looks interesting, how far into the worlds is your record grafo
    [EDIT](https://i.imgur.com/uSMwq0G.png)
        Haha, just start ok the lowest one for a while, as soon as you make it a hundred minutes in that one switch it up, do the same for normal to hard. (also try out the samurai dude called the Mercenary, he’s awesome, he doesn’t need to land on the ground, ever, late game)
            I thought the game was OK until I unlocked mercenary, I haven't fallen in love with a character's mechanics like that since Orianna from League of Legends.

My only complaint is I literally can't practice with that dude, my hand starts to cramp after an hour with how fast you need to be.
                I love Mercenary and the super punchy guy, the archer is pretty great too, but I can’t really get into Rex or the robot with two guns.
                    Rex is fantastic once you understand that your M2 does all the damage, M1 is minor healing and R is major healing/crowd control. He's amazing once you understand how he works
                    MUL-T was really tough for me to get into, but was also the first character I finished a Monsoon run with. Play with the Artifact of Command and pump some Goat Hooves into him, you may enjoy him once he's more mobile.
                        I do enjoy becoming speed itself in RoR2 whenever there is a Goat hoof printer or Soda printer.
                            With the artifact of command you can just make all the items you get be goat hoofs lol, you become dangerously fast, like falling of the map twenty times
                I’m also an Ori main, rejoice
        which of the characters is your favorite so far?
        The achievement to get to like stage 20 or something gets you the 57 leaf clover. Top tier legendario
Any tips on how to get better at the game?
    [**EDIT**](https://i.imgur.com/1rwhY5i.png) *(also if youre a Commando, your blue laser go through enemies, so use it from far to hit the boss in the distance while defending yourself)*
        You should be able to sprint through the first 3 levels without spending any time looting... from there you NEED to slow down because the mobs will be too strong otherwise.
            I've been always looting everything from the start. Got all the characters unlocked and majority of the items. But then again I haven't played on monsoon that much.
                Yeah on monsoon you gotta plan it out a little bit. If you dawdle on the first 3 worlds you get fucked later. 

Later it's a balancing act of progressing through the worlds fast enough so that you don't get overwhelmed while grabbing enough loot to stay strong. 


If you find a good 3D printer or a legendary chest it is ok to stay though. I had a run with like 20 soldiers syringes + dmg items recently and it was amazing.
                    I haven't been able to get past the fourth stage on Monsoon yet. I'm probably spending too much time looting in the previous stages. I always end up getting killed by the Elder Lemurians that start showing up at that time.
                        Basically just blitz the first 3 rounds. Then you can chill for a bit and loot. I believe in you
                I play exclusively on Monsoon, def want to get through the level quick but not avoid loot completely
            I'm not super familiar with the game, why would you skip through the levels like that without getting any upgrades?
                The game gets progressively harder with each minute the passes. In the earliest stages of the game its often better to level quickly as opposed to burning through the time to unlock all the loot boxes.

Monsters spawn so slow initially you'll be waiting around for them to spawn and waste time.

The 5 minutes you save going straight to the boss doesn't seem like a big deal, but a couple levels later when you're hit with a tougher enemies that are spawning faster and you might want those 5 minutes back.
        I know English isn’t your native language so FYI, the 1st “does,” is unnecessary. “What each item does,” would be correct.
            Holy shit! This dude isn't a native English speaker?!
            I'm pretty sure he actually just did that on accident.
        Also when you get your first artifact make sure it’s the artifact of command, then you can choose which items you get throughout the game
            i found artifact of command to utterly ruin the gameplay experience.  Customizing your build made the game much easier, but also took away the fun offered by the randomness of drops.  Also the interface was super clunky for such a fast paced game.
                Command saps the fun for me. I want to risk wax quails raining down on me.
            Oh no they updated with the Artifacts? Welp guess I gotta put more time in.
            Once you get command, build Will-o'-the-wisp (green) and pick up at least one ceremonial dagger (red). Then use white to build whatever is good for your character. I usually do 10 crit glasses, some teddy bears, other healing items, movement speed, and crowbars. At this point with a ton of wisps, you'll kill one mob and itll explode and kill everything around it. Anything that spawns soon after gets killed by the daggers from the last group. I usually pair Command with Soul, and Swarms as that will increase enemy spawn (more density for explosions). 


But like the other commenter said, command kinda takes away a lot of the fun because now I dont get to try other RNG builds.
                My friends have a pact of never getting ceremonial dagger because of how overpowered it is. Also, on command you don't need 10 crit glasses, items that give you crit bonuses like harvester scythe and predatory instinct give you a small amount of crit, 7-8 is plenty. Teddy bears and wax quails are an absolute must on monsoon with artifact of glass, unless you are playing engineer (in which case, dat sweet fungus), with command on, the only healing item that is really worth it is harvester scythes. There are a number of viable late game builds for monsoon but the easiest are status/death mark, sentient meat hook, missiles and willothewisps, and crit/crowbar/missiles. If you're doing all artefact monsoon runs, or the void fields, teddies are super important, as are armor plates, which also help with when you have to fight 4+ magma/overloading worms amd everything is awful. There are other builds of course, stacking razorwire on Rex is great, you basically just destroy everything in a huge radius. 

All artefact runs really make command much more balanced, but its not for the faint of heart (we usually turn artefact of death off because it is unfun in multi-player, it is hard enough already, and it becomes increasingly easier to accidentally teamkill). But watch out for the explosions. So many explosions. And those ice elites are really killer.
    Learn enemies' attacks and how to dodge them. Movement is a huge part of the game. Also it's easy to get overwhelmed by smaller guys while fighting boss, especially as commando as he doesn't have that much of crowd control, but it's a rogue like. The most punishing and forgiving genre at the same time. Don't be afraid to experiment with items and strategies.
        Literally never stop jumping and strafing lol

Play in a group if you can
    Check out whooliegaming on YouTube.
    Focus on your character's strengths and do everything to build around those strengths.

I typically play as REX (the plant) and I do my damnedest to get as many teddy bears, brooches, and scythes as possible.

It also helps if you play with friends who understand the strengths of your characters, so you can leave items for each other.
        > It also helps if you play with friends who understand the strengths of your characters, so you can leave items for each other.

Or play with my friends where it's a free-for-all and you die inside when your Huntress keeps taking focus crystals from you as Merc.
            I have a buddy who does that sometimes. We always yell at him. Conversation goes something like this:

Friend 1 (Engineer): Why did you just pick up your 4th fungus? I don't have any yet.

Friend 2/Jerk (Acrid): Bruh, fungus are good for everyone.

(Next time we play)

Me (Rex): Dude, why do you keep picking up all the teddy bears? It's literally the only thing that keeps me from killing myself.

Friend/Jerk (Acrid): Everybody needs teddies.
                Taking my bungus as Engineer is grounds for getting unfriended on Steam.
                    That's particularly egregious because if the Engineer has them it helps everyone.
                        Good thing we don't have to worry about it since the game decides not to spawn any bungus when there's an engi on the team.
                            aint that the truth.
    keep moving! keep shooting! keep moving!
    Biggest tip I would give is to never stop moving. Standing still is a big no-no in this game
    Don't spend more than 5 minutes per level. Once you hit 3:30,activate the teleporter. Check out r/riskofrain!
    The teleporter is always about as far away from your spawn point as it can be.
I suddenly feel the urge to play RISK OF RAIN 2

            Awesome! Well I know what I am going to play tonight.
         There are fragments of lore scattered about in both games if you're interested in lore related things, but there isn't otherwise any overarching storyline you'd need to worry about
            Thank you!
        Its a rogue like there isn't really a story. The second game is mostly a 3D remake of the first one
            There is a story!! You just have to piece it together from the encyclopedia magigers.
                Ok but is there a traditional plot this man can't follow without playing the first one or is that a bonus side lore thing?
            Thank you!
        Like others are saying, the story and lore comes form log entries for the different items you pick up.  


Basics of the first game's story is that a cargo ship was carrying an alien teleporter and an alien teleported onboard and proceeded to crash the ship. You played as one of the survivors of said ship, scavenging equipment that was onboard the cargo ship as you try to survive on an alien world.  


Second game's story isn't fully there yet since it won't be in 1.0 till August but it seems that the second game has members of a rescue ship that came to investigate the planet as well as some returning survivors from the first game.  


That's the basics of the story so you aren't missing too much and you can always go read the logs of the items and monsters from the first on the wiki if you're feeling bored/curious.
        The first one has a story but it's more of something you see as you play rather than it being something you have to know
        I was in the same situation you’re in a few months ago, and having played both extensively now, I can definitely recommend playing at least a little bit of risk of rain 1 before 2. Only took me like 4 hours to beat my first run, plus the 1st game has a final boss!
        I don't know if the digital or PC version is this way, but the physical console version of *Risk of Rain 2* includes the original *Risk of Rain.*
        Both games play almost identically, even though one is 2D and the other one 3D.  
Characters in Risk of Rain 2 feel like they have a lot more movement and freedom, while most abilities are only horizontal in the first Risk of Rain.
Other than that, the first part feels more arcadey and is still a lot of fun. The second part isn't completed yet and lacks a final level, while the first part has a pretty cool final boss.  
You can play them completely independent, but i would say Risk of Rain 2 makes an even better impression after having played the first part
        It was made by two engineering students in Gamemaker, he drew ALL of the artwork in MS Paint. It is a masterpiece all things considered, but takes a while to get really good at it. You have to understand that some runs are just doomed from the start and the permadeath feature is part of the game's flow. It gets hella intense towards the final level.
This comic brought to you by R~~aid: Shadow Legends~~isk Of Rain 2
    This comic is the funniest SirGrafo has ever made.  
That's not a joke, either.
Hey, you can't come in here and mention a game because it's good! You have any idea how many marketers you're gonna put out of work?
    [**EDIT**](https://i.imgur.com/0VKupxX.png) *~~(More like how many reposters Im gonna put out of work)~~*
        That's how I usually wind up stumbling across all kinds of games that I might never have looked twice at before. ...and why I like to browse the Indie sections more and more as time goes on.
            Hey another one like me! If you like pixel horror check out "The Count Lucanor" by Baroque Decay. They also made a sequel which I'm playing through right now called "Yuppie Psycho".

EDIT: Not a sequel! Just another game, sorry.
            Funny you mention "stumbling" across stuff. I first found Minecraft on the website StumbleUpon back when that was a big(ger) thing, thought it would be a neat toy and bought it early. Man has that been a *great* investment.
        If you have a few close friends and a computer, Crawl is a fun, local co-op, dungeon crawl, indie game where you compete with your friends to inhabit a human body and escape a dungeon.

Don't know if you already know the game, but thought I'd help with your game discovery.

Edit: It's on console too, so should be accessible. Nintendo Switch by far has to be the most beneficial, since there is no online play.
        OMG YES!!!

why does this sub is so obsessed with upvoting the same damn thing over and over again!!??

I understand different "few" people not seeing and posting it, but the up-voting in mass 4k+ upvotes that means is majority of those people already seen THAT last week or yesterday or 12 hours ago or 4h ago also!

Its just impossible to miss for majority of users, and yet there they are the same damn dub reposts upvoted to front page by the brainless  bandwagon
        A different genre (kinda) but check out slay the spire if you're into rogue likes.

Deck building, RNG, fun encounters.
They recently released the iOS version too. I'm patiently waiting for the android so I can never be productive at work ever again.
        Well in that case, if you like RoR2, I highly recommend Gunfire Reborn. It's a new roguelike shooter with a progression system, it kind of plays like Borderlands and RoR2 smashed together. I think the name is just a direct translation, the generic name doesn't do justice for how fun this game is.
        It really did fly under the radar. It's a shame that great indie games like this only really get exposure to people who already play their current titles. I only knew about the sequel from playing the first so much and it was on their steam news way back.
        Have you played the binding of isaac?
        I'm really enjoying your comic replies
        Sorry we haven't told you before! It has been cross-posted to r/riskofrain the devs are hopefully going to see it! Jump into the discord if you like.

And there is yet so much more to come. Both for the current state of the game you are exploring and until release (and hopefully even more after that).
        One of my friends doesn't like indie games, smh my head. Mechanics are the most important part of a game for me, and indie games are just soooo much more inventive. Glad to see RoR2 getting some love.

Games I'm playing rn: relaxing forest survival Among Trees (only on early access on epic rn), and Outer Wilds (not far in but it's managed to stay on my mind since the start)

                    Idk choke it down?
I love Risk of Rain 1 and 2.

 I recently found a newish game that's been pulling me in as much as Risk of Rain, so I'd say its worth a look if your a fan: Gunfire Reborn.
    Are you a Woolie main too?? ;)
    Seconded. Not as content rich as Risk of Rain 2 yet, but damn is it fun.
        Not yet at least, it's still in early access and from the looks of the load screens, theres at least one more character on the way.
            Yeah and they're working tirelessly, judging from all the little updates.
    Gunfire Reborn that new hotness.
Is it more innovative than SUPERHOT? SUPERHOT is the most innovative shooter I’ve played in years.
    SUPER. HOT.

SUPER. HOT.
        This guy SUPER HOTS.
    Both mess with different element of the game. Risk of Rain (both 1 and 2) use time you spend in game to make enemies stronger so you have to balance your strategy. If you progress to quickly, you'll have less accessories that give you passive buffs and thus making you weaker but if you stay on one map for too long, your enemies will become stronger and might overpower you. It's a good rogue like.
    Yes, SUPERHOT  is the most innovative shooter I have played in years.
    I don't think there's anything innovative about RoR2 really. The mechanic that sets it apart (difficulty increases each 5min) the most was also in the first, released in 2013....and probably used in games before that.

But what it does, it does well. And the music is great. The team is tiny, which I respect. And despite being an early access game they've been open about everything from day 1 and they made true on their promises.
Gee thanks, now all day long I'm just going to see web and video ads with "Risk of Rain 2, play now!"
It’s all fun and games until a walking pile of bricks starts shooting red lasers at you
This game is really addictive I have played 8 hours straight once
    8 hours well spent.
Fuck. This game made me realize that I do, in fact, still love gaming and not just 100hr long rpgs. Just sitting down and sinking 3-4 hours into a run to feel like a God. It's, man, it's just beautiful.

Can't wait for the updates.
Hmmm. I dont get the joke.
    There isn't one, I don't think any of his comics have one
        They definitely used to, but it's basically now just mundane observations and comments. Once you reach reddit celebrity status, though, you get automatic upvotes.
    The joke is that people think this isn't an advertisement
        Recommendation is a form of advertisement
        I dunno, ROR2 is a pretty good game. I keep telling people to get it.

But what about Risk of Rain 1?
Wait, is this multiplayer? :D
    Honestly i wouldn't recommend, you get even more sucked in and kinda becomes competitive and suddenly you sit there at 2 at night wondering were the fuck the last 6 hours went.

^(But of course I highly recommend it, so fun!)
        Time 256:39  ....HAHAHAHA....

"Nah we might as well hit 300 at this point"

Time 445:30  ...HAHAHAHA.....  
"Yo how is there light coming through my windows already?"
        How do you get competitive in this game of all things?

It's a team-based PvE.
    Yes it is! And you don't have to go through awkward configuration and complicated setups like Risk of Rain had in the first game.
    For anyone doing multiplayer, there are some pretty good mods out that allow you to share items you pick up. Makes it feel more co-op. If you hate your friends though, no need to mod.
    [deleted]
    Yeah. It's a lot of fun with a couple friends!
    my experience with multiplayer is that once there are more than 100 enemies on screen, it's completely unplayable and freezes for 30+seconds.  Seen a lot of people complaining about that happening with no fixes suggested.  Doesn't happen on single player so no, it's not my hardware.  Also doesn't seem to be an issue for other people in the same lobby.  Ruined the game for me, but if anyone's heard of a fix I'd be very happy.
        Never had such problems and i've had 4 hour multiplayer runs that were relativly stable.

It all depends on the type of enemy you get; parents and elites are hard hitters and have frozen (permanently) a singleplayer run at 4 hours because a stage event forced only parents to spawn while the advanced time resulted in pretty much only elites.

Try to have the person with the best computer host the server
I can't be the only one that finds a lack of a goal mildly infuriating like the mechanics are fun, unlocking new characters are fun but like 'let's see how long u can survive' idk how that's fun... But I also dislike cod zombies too so idk
    Like u/snipercat94 mentioned, there is a narrative "end" to your run that you can choose to do when you get to that point.  It rewards you with a special kind of currency which lets you unlock special items in-game called Lunar items, which can be game-changingly powerful or detrimental.  And aside from that, there's a secret boss you can access via this system which is sort of meant as an "endgame" to your run.

However, it's worth mentioning that the full game isn't even out yet, and the first one *did* have a final boss named Providence.  The final boss for this game hasn't been revealed yet, but I would put money on them putting one in.
        For PC players there will be a final boss coming sometime in august when the game leaves early access. Along with that will come a whole new character, new enemies, new items, and the final stage for the final boss.
    I mean, your end "goal" could be to end existential pain and "obliterate" yourself at the obelisk. In order to do so, you need to cycle trough the maps once, and then you have to last 3 more maps, and a "celestial portal" will open, where you can go in for obliterate yourself and end the run.  

So even if the game as of right now does not have a climatic ending (like "face a final boss -> run ends and credits roll), you could still take obliteration as the end goal.
It's always a 50/50 chance. It's either gonna rain or it's not, and you'll never change my mind.
    Just to kill some time, I'll take a stab at it.

To start, I'm going to argue that there is actually a 100/0 chance, in the sense that you pointed out that it is either going to rain, or it's not. This is based on the assumption that weather is a deterministic system. Essentially what I'm saying is that, on any given day at a specific location, it is going to deterministically rain or not rain. On the days that it is deterministically going to rain, there is a 100% chance it will rain. On the days that it is deterministically not going to rain, there is a 0% chance it will rain.

The idea of determinism is basically that given a certain set of inputs to a system, there are predictable outputs. This also includes situations where we are currently not able to predict those outputs due to limited understanding of the system or limited knowledge of the inputs. So, while we can not accurately say whether a day is a deterministic rain day or not, we can say that there is a deterministic system that controls whether a day is a rain day, which would support the conclusion that the chance is 100% or 0%.

But is weather deterministic? Probably. In fact, not only is weather likely to be deterministic, but so is all of classical physics; that is, physics concerning things on a scale larger than individual atoms. Since weather is observed on such a scale, we can reasonably believe it to be deterministic.

So, up until this point, I have essentially agreed with you that it is either going to rain or it is not, which might make you think I should conclude that there is a 50/50 chance. There are two barriers to that conclusion, though.

First, science is largely based on observation. We can record the number of rainy days at any given location over a length of time and in that way know how many days are rainy and how many are not. For example, Mt Wai-'ale-'ale in Hawaii receives over 350 rainy days each year. Therefore, without any knowledge of the system that controls weather for that location, we can conclude that Mt Wai-'ale-'ale has an approximately 95.9% probability of precipitation on any given day, since 350/365≈0.959. Another way of looking at that number is to say that 95.9% of days include a deterministic system which we might not fully understand but will determine there to be rain (a 100% chance on those days) and 4.1% of days include that same deterministic system determining that there will not be rain (a 0% chance on those days). This still supports the idea that it is either going to rain or not rain, as you asserted, but points out that those two occurrences do not come with equal probability, as can be observed. We can extrapolate from the statistic about Mt Wai-'ale-'ale that any place on Earth has a probability of precipitation on any day of between 0% and 95.9% depending on whether it is a very dry place on Earth with approximately 0 days of rain per year, it is the wettest place on Earth with 350 days of rain per year, or any of the other places that fall somewhere in between.

Second, there is the complex system of weather itself. It is likely that it is a deterministic system. That is not to say in any way that we fully understand that system, as I am not a climatologist or a meteorologist and am not fully versed in the latest science on this topic so I cannot conclude one way or the other. It is also not to say that we fully know all the inputs to that system for the same reason. However, knowing that it is deterministic and that some days are just going to rain and some days are just not going to rain, it may become useful to be able to say, specifically, which days are which. As pointed out above, we can say over a larger time scale what the probability of precipitation is each day, but that is without specificity. So, how do we know which days it will deterministically rain? If you have lived in one area for at least a year you will probably have some sense that different times of year get more rain than others. You may know that there are places on Earth where people consider there to be a "wet season" and a "dry season". The differences between those can be pretty extreme in some areas. So, armed with that knowledge, we can probably recognize that it is not helpful to say that the chance of rain during a "dry season" is the same as the chance of rain during a "wet season". So, the yearly averages discussed above, while providing a valid probability of precipitation for each day over the course of a year would not be helpful. Through science, that is to say through observation and experimentation, we can determine not only what parts of the year are more wet or more dry, but we can also determine that some local or semi-local weather events are predictors for wet or dry periods to follow them. Given that weather is deterministic, if we fully understood it we could probably accurately conclude from such an event whether that system gives a day a 100% chance of rain or a 0% chance of rain, since it must rain or not rain at any given location on any day. However, it is likely that we do not fully understand that system and therefore we are limited by that understanding in our ability to say whether it will rain. We can say that while we do not fully understand the system to state whether a day will, 100%, rain, based on that system, we can hypothesize with a certain amount of confidence whether it will rain or not on a given day based on prior observations and rigorously tested predictive models. This means that while we cannot say whether a day will rain or not, we can say how confident we are with a prediction of rain on a given day, which, for ease of understanding and data consumption, can be described as the probability of precipitation on that day. Since there are things we wish to do day-to-day that may be affected by precipitation, these confidence values are likely to be more helpful than the averaged probability discussed above.

tl/dr:

So, to sum up: yes, it will either rain or not rain on any given day; no, that doesn't mean the chance is 50/50, but rather 100/0 based on some deterministic system we don't fully understand; through basic observation we can get somewhat accurate numbers to describe that deterministic system through averaging data observed over a long period of time, but that description may not be helpful; through a combination of observation and predictive modelling we can, with variable confidence, say whether it will rain; and these confidence numbers, while not a true indication of that probability, are often quite helpful and are easily understood as such.
        Spoiler: there’s zero rain in the game.
            Oh I know, lol.
                Hahaha well good on you then :D
        I appreciate the effort
Is good game but boring after like 40 runs doing the same thing over and over like playing cod just for zombies, eventually you either die or you survive to the point of being a god and the only thing you do is click once and all tour items just chain killing everything as it spawns
    It's supposed to have an 'end'. RoR1 had an end (though you could loop around the levels as many times as you wanted).
    Pump it up to the highest difficulty and start using artifacts that make the gameplay more difficult and fun.
I love it, especially with the artifacts.
Trying since 3 days to Unlock that damn deativated Robot in that Hellish Mine
    Haha yeah, Rex is kinda hard to unlock. My tip would be to try and unlock an equipment barrel on every stage, swap out, finish teleporter, go back to pick it up. The addition of Siren’s Call makes things so much more difficult though.
What was the game's name again? Didn't quite catch it
    Not sure. I think they'll mention it after the news.

This is definitely a paid promotion.

        Both
            Leave. I did ages ago, happened by here with a crosspost.
This is literally an ad.
I loved Risk of Rain, but Risk of Rain 2 looks so much different...
    It plays just like the first game but in 3d. Legitimately an upgrade in every way. Played for dozens of hours on launch week
It's sad that you can't recommend games anymore without people thinking it's some kind of advertisement.
Instructions unclear, reinstalling Risk Of Rain 1.
13k fucking upvotes, this guy is genuinely the worst thing about reddit.
    There’s way worse things about Reddit.  Having said that, I was a big fan of his rimworld comic until he got his own subreddit. I feel like the comic kinda went a direction I didn’t like after that. I was subbed to his sub for a while but I realized there really wasn’t anything for me there and I was getting annoyed at how many times I’d see the same meme templates circulate in a week. Usually not even remotely funny. Sometimes I really do like what he puts out though and most of the time I dig how he responds to people with comics. I don’t think you’re wrong to be annoyed though.
    13K upvotes and like 8 awards.... for a gaming recommendation?? I really don’t understand if he uses bots, or if his pre-teen fans are just this fucking dumb.
    The fact that this is the top comment appearing on “controversial” comments is the worst thing about Reddit.

    His porno memes that he aims towards teens are creepy imo.  Seems like a scumbag.

Sorry but I prefer the original game
Typical shill.
I’d rather play gunfire reborn
    Hah, I play both
It actually is a fun game. I am absolutely terrible at it though.
Excuse me sir, we only post about ps5 here
I own it but haven't played it yet, much like the other 75% of my steam library.
Excellent game! I just wish there was more stuff :D
First one is better
Just got it yesterday. Very nice distraction from the last of us 2. Stress relieving.
I have a lot of respect for the risk of rain developer jumping into 3D and not just wallowing in 2D. Haven’t played 2 yet but I have no doubts it’s good.

And while we are recommending games, everybody check out the demo for gloomwood!
The original is also really good
Don't forget about a first game.its damn good two 👍
Wait, people are still playing that game?  I played it a bit a few years back and then forgot about it.
My friend and I tried it on the free steam weekend. We all got hooked and bought it. It’s a great multiplayer game!
Still waiting the joke
Ok, game for a game, i try Risk of rain 2, you try Hollow knight or Outer wilds (which ever one you haven't played)
Risk of Rain 2 is very fun.
Sellout! Sellout! Boo!

/s
Did anyone mention yet how amazing the soundtrack is?
YES! RISK OF RAIN 2 BABY!!!
I also recommend risk of rain 2, really good rougelike that keeps your time for quite a while, it gets rough pretty fast if you aren't prepared
So is Risk of Rain 2 full of lame jokes and bad graphics?
I’m guessing quitting your day job to draw cartoons isn’t working out too well
I might be in the minority here but I preferred the first.

        We'll have to wait for Reddit 2
            Or JrGrafo.
                Isnt SrGrafo short for Señor Grafo, or is it senior
                    I always read it in my head as “sir grafo”
                        Am I the only one who read it as Sargeant Graph I?
                            Yes
                    I'm not sure tbh. I was just making a silly joke. We would have to ask the man himself for clarification.
                        Calling user u/srgrafo for clarification
                    I always thought dude was a Brit and its "Sir Grafo"
                    Psure its sir
                    Makes me think of Señor Senior Sr from Kim Possible
                    He's portuguese, so it's "senhor grafo". Here we abreviate it like this, senhor (portuguese for mister) to sr, like you do it from mister to mr.

    Might be late to catch your attention in this random reply, but I've been really loving the mods for risk of rain 2. The Goku one (yes, dbz) is incredibly well made and there's another mod that creates random character classes to pick by mixing up models and abilities. 

For example, played one yesterday that let me walk around as the giant crawling oil pot and my abilities were (1) some fireball with 33 shots before cool down, (2) some slow moving projectile that exploded on contact, (3) self damaging ability that shot me backwards, (4) summon up to 3 crawling turrets. 

It's pretty epic.

--edit: mods are at https://thunderstore.io/ and the mod manager from there handles dependencies and things
        I'm gonna need to check that out. That second mod sounds insanely cool
            u/undeleteparent
            There's somewhere in the config you can set a seed so you can generate the same heroes every time if you want to play multiplayer with them, otherwise it's random every time the game starts up. It's pretty cool and some are broken bad or broken good. The one I tried there was probably the most powerful one, but some what balanced by being big and slow. 

The replay value in that mod is hard to put to words :)
                Is there a name for the mod that I can look for?
        Oh there’s workshop capability now? I haven’t played since it came out
            er, no - I'll edit the mod site into my first reply because it's neither steam nor the usual nexus. It's  [https://thunderstore.io/](https://thunderstore.io/)  and the mod manager from there handles it all :)
                Oh awesome I’m gonna have to do that! Saw a video and it looks super easy
                    I'm using the random survivors mod and the goku mod. Both are awesome and work together despite warnings in the random mod that specific character mods may cause issues. Random survivors pretty much takes care of the content ever becoming stale since it creates a random set every time the game is launched. The goku mod is still worth checking out though because it is so well made - the model, the voice lines, the additional systems (transformations, energy meter, power level, etc). 

It's the most fun dbz gaming experience I've had and it's just a mod for another game.
                        you just awakened my dbz flame again bro. Its been a while since playing some DBFZ or some budokai lol im definitely doing it tonight
                            Just be sure to adjust his loadout. I prefer meteor crash to ki blast and charge to instant transmission. Using charge to scream raise your energy is the most DBZ thing ever. I believe the transformations go all the way up to kaioken x20 and super saiyan blue, both active at the same time lol.

Just read up carefully on the mechanics so you use 'em all and it's like.. damn, why can't regular dbz games be this good?
        I have not tried any of those, but now I gotta O\_o
            Goku has voicelines and additional mechanics. He's got a power level which lets you transform into various super saiyan and kaioken forms. He's also got loadouts so you can choose between things like kamehameha or spirit bomb. Oh and he can fly :P It's probably the best *dbz*  gameplay I've experienced and it's just a ROR mod lol
                Is it a steam community mod or nexxus or what?

:o
                    I edited it into my original reply. The risk of rain community seems to have their own website which is neither the steam workshop nor the usual nexus mod site. They've got  [https://thunderstore.io/](https://thunderstore.io/) and you're looking for something called RoR2ModManager by scottbot95. 

I grew up with mods and it's been rough since MW2 where modding more or less officially died for AAA games so more DLC can be sold / games die faster so more sequels can be made. Or undying shit like GTA V.
                        Oh I love modding, and I don't mind mod managers at all. I'd just never known about any that existed for RoR. I'm exiteeeed :D
                            It's the perfect game for them :) there's an api mod for RoR as well if you decide to try and make one. That goku one is very inspiring.
    How many edits have you made that can be taken so far out of context?
    Their only mistake was not leaving anything for Risk of Rain 3. They're out of dimensions!
        ... But they can make it VR. Oooooh.
            Now there's an idea!
    This panel needs to be a reusable reaction. 😂
Yeah this is why I haven't played 2. Sounds like it's good. RoR is awesome but so fucking hard. & That's coming from a Dead Cells punishment glutton.
    RoR was hard as fuck. RoR 2 is also hard, but in a more managable, steadily increasing fashion. You should play it.  


Matter of fact, if you (AND ONLY YOU, DANG IT.) reply to this message, I'll send you a steam code.
        Damn what!? That's a deal! Fuckin gamers man.. the best people ever. I absolutely promise I will play it.. given this super effective recommendation.

UPDATE: played all last night. it's phenomenal. I'll be paying this forward on u/Nytohan 's new sub r/PayItForwardGaming . Hey u/SrGrafo is there anyone in this thread that you think deserves to be surprised w/ a steam code?
            [removed]
                UPDATE: registered and installed!! Can not wait to play this after work. You, my friend, earned more than just internet karma today. Thank you!
                    Sounds like someone just made a friend. That's heartwarming... I'm leaving the internet for today so it can't destroy the faith in humanity I just gained.
                        Hey, you go have an excellent day.

                        Ah shit you find me on steam? Wait is there online multiplayer or am I wooshing right now? (Steam username is same)
                Just letting you know, you sold a copy based on this as well.  If you like it enough to give it to an internet stranger, then that's a good enough recommend for me, and I bought it immediately.
                    Oh god, that's more pressure than I was expecting.

I hope you like the game!
                        G'wan  git, ya heartwarmin' fucks.
                            The influence is strong today. This is good influence though, not social media influence. Wait, this is a form of social media. Shit.
                                Sr Grafo is an influencer!
                        If it makes you feel better, I read this series of comments and immediately went and bought it then immediately returned it, stating "Nytohan can't be trusted" as my reason.
                            I mean... that's not UNTRUE.
                        i own the game as well and just wanted to put my 2 cents in that i love it as well. have fun guys!
                        Honestly that went double for me. I get off work in 12 hours and I'm gonna be picking it up too. Let's do this shit.
                The gaming community is great sometimes
                    Yeah that’s a huge sometimes.
                You know what, because you're a cool dude I'll buy the game as soon as I can.

People like you are why I love the gaming community.
                What a legend. God, The Last Of Us subreddit could use a dose of this kindness right now.
                    Last of us subreddit is a reflection of the game, people tearing eachothers appart
            Fuckin *gamers* man. Fun fact, I got Fallout: NV in a similar way to this.
                Is New Vegas any good?
                    Fantastic. The base game can go as low as $3 during sales and I’ve never had more fun patrolling the Mojave
                    I think I’ve put close to 1000 hours into the game across 3 consoles and multiple play throughs, it’s my favorite fallout game
                    Yeah. It's great. Not without bugs... but just great. I am actually replaying it now.
                I had someone gift me Oxygen Not Included in a similar way, too
            Would be fun if you liked it, and only if you really liked it, to also gift a key to semeone else, and if that person also likes it to gift it to another person, etc, etc
                Hey, I like this idea. A lot. Just set up a subreddit, /r/PayItForwardGaming.  
Need to set up how it works and all, but maybe this can be a thing.
        🏅 here’s a poor mans gold
            It's so much more meaningful because you made it yourself.
        I didn't expect to come across something so wholesome while reading Reddit, but here we are.
            "Be excellent to each other." -  *Bill S*. *Preston*, *Esq*.
        Risk of Rain was hard until you got the modifier that lets you pick what upgrade you want everytime you pick one up.  Once you know which upgrade is which and how effective they are, it's a relative cakewalk depending on what character you pick.  Some of them feel completely helpless solo.  Hit speed, leech on hit and leech on kill, overall HP increases... stuff like that turns you into a tank in no time and from there you pick stuff that ups damage either directly or indirectly.  Chef with that stuff is practically invincible from the crazy amounts of leech on hit.  I love watching like 30 homing rockets shoot out into the sky and rain down on enemies every time I open a chest.
        I haven't played either one, which should I play first?
            Honestly, Risk of Rain didn't grab me like RoR 2, but go check out some videos. We all have our own preferences!
            There isn't really an important continuity to it. There IS a bit of story behind it all in the Dark Souls way. But like Dark Souls, playing them in any order won't really change your experience of it.  


It really comes down to which you enjoy more, 2D or 3D. Some people find one or the other much harder to grapple with.
            If you like 2D platformers, the original is good fun. If you're more into 3D shooters, then RoR2 is fantastic.
        Take this platinum and get out of here you beautiful bastard you.
            Why anyone would spend money on an internet stranger is beyond me, but thank you! :)
        Codes or it didn't happen...
            I mean, I can give you the now used steam code...
    As someone who played ror2 before the first game, the first game is way harder to get into I feel. I've never been good at 2d combat games like terraria or starbound though so that may explain why the easiest difficulty in the first game felt like the hardest difficulty in the second game to me. An important thing to note, there are difficulty levels life the first game and the hardest difficulty level is only required for cosmetic "mastery" skins for each character.
        I tried 1 first and I just couldn't get the hang of controlling a character the size of like 4 pixels, I could barely last 5 minutes.  I was able to play for over 90 minutes first run on 2.
    I loved risk of rain, but found the second one to be too hard.

I'm a pretty casual gamer though. I just sucked at the 3d movement.
        God I'm the exact opposite. So many years of playing RoR1, RoR2 feels stupid easy in comparison. I'm good at shooters though so that might be it.
            Yeah I suck at shooters.
                You should play the huntress then. She's really good for people who aren't great at 3d shooting.
            It's so much harder to dodge in RoR2 though. In 1 you just need to jump, in 2 the enemies have aimbots that are always targeting you so you need to either kill them or get behind something to avoid them.
                It's really mostly lesser wisps, to be honest. No other enemy in the game has a body count near as high, I'm sure of it.
                    I found that its just because the game is balanced to prevent god runs more. They still happen but you're more likely to die before you can get a build that is truly unkilleable.
                    Even when you’re not running Shaped Glass, the bastards will kill you. Especially Blazing ones.
                The trick is positioning, movement, and prioritizing wisps until you have will'o'wisps or some ukuleles. You should always be moving to place the enemy at your maximum engagement range and minimizing how surrounded you are, merc has iframes to deal and loader should be moving in and out quickly. Fighting under a hoard of wisps is a great way to eat shit. These days I mostly play with Artifact of Glass, so I might be biased, but it's always better to move to a more advantageous spot than brawl it out.
        Shit I'm out then. Same thing happened to me and Hotline Miami 2. If I can't actually finish a game it just haunts me.
            Be like me and just play with command, and try and do wacky things. I have never looped a monsoon without it, but ill keep trying. Until then ill keep messing around and having fun with command.
            Well there is no beating Risk of Rain 2, it just keeps getting harder til you lose. (There are difficulty settings for how fast it ramps up).
                There is technically ways to "win". Gotta get through the blue portal.
                    Celestial portal, I think blue goes to the friendly lizard wizard
            I got 99.9% completion on Spyro when I was a kid, all I had left was one dragon and a few gems in the Treetops level which I kept struggling to reach. One day my memory card was full and I accidentally deleted the save freeing up space for another game.

More recently I picked up Spyro: Reignited but I still never managed to get to that platform on Treetops, and I don't play PS4 much these days anyway.
            Argh man that army camp level still gives me nightmares. Stick with it though you'll do it.
    Have you tried nuclear throne?
        Nah but my buddy has it in our family share dealio.. what's up with it?
            I've never beat it. I've beat every rouge lite I play, but not nuclear throne.
    It depends on if you play with the seals or not. There are some insanely fun combinations. Being able to pick items, then eventually ramp up to unlimited use items is really fun. Especially when one of the use items gives you more items so you can destroy everything.

I definitely have not spent 4 hours in 1 game just ramping items so I can beat the boss instantly with barbed wire by existing.
    What you think of Dark Souls? (Any)
    RoR2 gets me to a point of being unkillable more often than RoR did. Even then though, I will still eventually die, even if it take three hours.
    I am not a fan. Tried it for a few hours, but it does not click.
Bro, I was SO skeptical. I thought they were gonna ruin the original feel of the game but they NAILED it.
    I haven't played it yet but I'm hoping the soundtrack is as good as the first one. They brought back the same guy so I hope it is. He also did some great work on Deadbolt, another 2D game by the same studio.
        Yes! Chris is an amazing artist. The music in 2 SLAPS my guy. It is just as top tier as 1, with some motifs and nods to it as well. I played deadbolt just to hear his music! He’s truly wonderful.
[EDIT](https://i.imgur.com/zDYvFOq.png)
    Haven't played 2 but Risk of Rain 1 is also really really good, albeit pretty different from 2
        Ror2 is literally ror1 but in a 3d world. If you enjoy ror1 I highly recommend ror2. Just keep in mind it's moderately early Access, so it's not perfectly fleshed out. There are also changes to certain items and stuff.

Oh god what did I start here.
            The next update will be the end of early access. I think it's dropping soon.

*Spelling
                Bought it day one, played a few hours and decided to wait until it is out of early access.  Still was tons of fun tho.
                    Its a ton of fun, but it takes forever to unlock characters. Its also not clear how to unlock them all.
                        Well I mean they are hidden on purpose.
                        i would say you're good to go ahead and look up how to unlock them - the first few characters i unlocked just by playing the game in my first 7 or so runs i reckon.  


once you get into it, you'd have to actively avoid working out/finding out how to unlock the characters.  


the artifacts however... wow there's a bit of a puzzle and also a lot of work.
                        Exactly like RoR1. Great series.
                        Google makes it very clear. And if it still too difficult I recommend using mods once to unlock new characters. I agree they need to do better with explaining how to unlock them though.
                        [deleted]
                            Thats a great idea!
                        I find it super difficult!!
                        I just edited my save to unlock all the characters. I told my friends to do the same. The game's more fun when you find a character you like. That first one (? I don't remember) and Huntress are fine and all but imo, are among the most boring characters. They might be your only characters after 5 hours of play too if you're doing things blind.
                        It is **pretty** clear. I've owned it for write some time. Maybe you didn't look in the logs?
                    I've been playing on/off since day one and I must say, go ahead and pick it back up, it's loads and loads of fun. And you'll definitely see the love that's gone in to it. Especially if you played 1 :)
                    yeah, I loved 1 and bought 2 just to re-reward the developers. I fully expected the move to 3D to ruin it.

Played a few hours at the beginning of Early Access and was really surprised at how well the mechanics translated. Then I put it down because it's worth waiting for fewer bugs and more features.

Basically, it's the poster child for how Early Access should work.
                August
                August is 1.0.
                What's the status on difficulty?  I played a ton when it first dropped and had a great time, then the update dropped that retooled difficulty and it was suddenly absolutely crushingly hard.  Like an order of magnitude more difficult, even at the normal difficulty.

Have they balanced that out at all?  My friends and I were getting absolutely demolished, to the point where it was a lot less fun compared to when it first launched.
                August is the 1.0 release, I'm really excited
                Sounds like a possibility of a sale! Hopefully there's a sale on switch too

        Very different. It's also pretty fun from the time I've had playing it. If you prefer a third person shooter then it's your game. Wisps are also deadlier somehow...
            It's different... While being the exact same game somehow
                Yes, which is why it's one of my highly recommended games as well. The only game I know of with a better 2D->3D jump was GTA.
        Nah, my biggest gripe with ROR2 is that it's literally just ROR1 but 3d which, IMO, hurts the experience. I enjoyed 1 a far deal greater because it's very difficult to wrap your head around enemies coming at you from 360°.

But that's just preferences on my part. It's still a very good game.

Shit, I recommend it for the music alone. Chris Christodoulou has consistently knocked it out of the park for three games now (including Deadbolt), a sung hero. Some of my favorites

RoR1: [Moisture Deficit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbzA6lX84xM)  
RoR1: [Surface Tension](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzJlzGaQFoc)  
RoR2: [The Rain Previously Known as Purple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ew5UxawEKyo)  
RoR2: [Into the Doldrums](https://youtu.be/UJHsClcXEFk?t=2405)  
Deadbolt: [The Proverbial Dust Biters](https://youtu.be/x49QnXu7qos?list=PLLDf8Bnp1K1KRaROXv8e8W9MMprJ_Xf42)   
Deadbolt: [Now I am Become Death](https://youtu.be/OD4E_YsZ2-A?list=PLLDf8Bnp1K1KRaROXv8e8W9MMprJ_Xf42)  
(but seriously his entire Deadbolt OST is imo better than most of the RoR OSTs, you really need to listen to it)

This man needs more games. He's got a wealth of talent.
    Damn, the rain previously known as purple is a stunningly beautiful track.
        Great name too
            Not a very subtle reference to Purple Rain by Prince, I love it

Purple Rain guitar solo is in there too
    The music is what really got me into the game. It has excellent gameplay, but combined with the OST and it's one of those games you just love to sit down a waste a couple hours playing.
        My only complaint is that it absolutely devours time.
            Me: I'll just do a quick run on easy and screw around. 

137 minutes into the run: fuk.
            i just wish there was a functionality to save mid run and continue at another time
                There are so many mods, check it out, saves you at the start of each stage.

            I did an endless run in RoR1 that lasted about 20 hours. I put on the cheat to pick my drops and wanted to see just how OP I could get. Turns out you can be pretty much invincible.
        9PM: I'll just play a quick game of RoR2 before bed

2:35AM: fuck
    Oh yeah the music is a solid 10/10
    When I booted up Risk of rain 2, years after playing risk of rain 1 (and loving it), the menu music gave me chills
    Check out Iji and Chris Geehan. How that was released for free just absolutely blows my mind. 

[It's a slow burn. Let it simmer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c0Ha-O09aY)

Better yet, play the game. It's better with context.
        Oh hey, amusing to run across this as I am listening to a [remix of Tor's theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CBOU-42eJE)
            I must assume you're a pretty rad person.
    This dude is a mad genius. The unusual time signatures, the weird and wavy instruments, the funky beats and not to mention the incredible keyboard melodies that sometimes sounds like he just rolls his hands across the keyboard. It's perfection
So much chaos on one screen
    And I love it.
I bought it day one, but haven't played in over a year.

I really do need to get back into it one of these days.
    I highly recommend you do. They have added tons of secrets and new characters in that time.
        Yeah part of why I decided to wait awhile was so that I could play through a ton of new content, instead of just playing through new content as it came out and potentially getting bored.

I wanted it to feel more like the original when I played that, where there was already most of the game in place.
            If you want a huge change, somebody upthread said that they are working on the "out of early access" patch, so it might be worth checking their blog or whatever -- if you've already waited a year, a month or so might not be a big wait (I know nothing about their timeline, it is just a thought). 

OTOH they did add many of the classic artifacts from 1, so there's definitely enough new stuff to play through.
HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
    People be downvotin, but rest assured the players of this game understand you.

And we feel your pain.
        The worst thing with the game is that if you don't die, your PC will eventually.
            Yup, crashed game at 4:30:00 in and 4:35:00 so its a fine line apparently lol
        Looks like people in the know corrected that one quick.

i literally just bought risk of rain 2 because of this thread
It's been a journey watching it grow
Your bustling fungus hand it over
    Darn engineers stealing all the fungus.
        Who else do you want to have it? The artificer?
Does this game of perm death?
    Yes but there is a rare item that gives you an extra life. The game is about getting as far as you can.
        I always forget I have one of those. Whenever I get revived I instantly die again.
    it's a "rogue lite". if you're not familiar with the genre there is random loot, perma-death, and no saving. But you can complete achievements to unlock more types of loot and characters.
    Yes. The gameplay consists of gaining items to make your character more powerful while the difficulty increases every second. It's not a game you can really win. The challenge is to see how far you can go.
Did they ever fix that thing where in order to get new skills to cycle out you need to play in a completely stupid way with a character that may or may not pan out based upon the RNG you get for that current game?

I love playing Risk of Rain 2 whenever my brother comes into town. We sit on the couch and will play for hours upon hours. But it always really annoyed me that there was no real progression for my character unless I wanted to take a few hours to do something dumb with no real achievement.
    The whole progression of the game is to unlock more stuff for the next run. It's part of the rougelike experience.
        I mean I understand the rogue like mechanics but the idea of unlocking is fairly limited in RoR. Not all higher tier skills are more viable than the base skills and there are a few separate classes to unlock. 

I enjoy the game. 

I like it a lot. 

I think it has really sweet coop for couch playing. 

I just never found their idea of progression to be very interesting or fun.
            Fair enough, haven't really tested it out lately so I haven't really checked out the newest stuff. Had a blast when it came out but even then it was some stuff that was a bit grindy/hard to unlock without external help.
                I just used this website. https://tbfts.github.io/ror2_save_editor/ to edit my save and give me all unlocks.

It's a roguelike so you still need to get lucky to have a good playthrough but with everything unlocked at least you know all items and abilities are available to you during your run.
It’s a solid game.
Same it’s honestly one of the best games I’ve played in a while, mostly for its replayaility
How do I not suck on normal difficulty?

    Fake advertisement, count me out!

No need for lies.
        No rain, just the constant risk that there might be some
            Sounds like the average summer day where I live
                A fellow Brit I see.
                    Central Canada actually. Usually we don’t get too much rain but the last month has been really stormy and there has been a risk of rain almost every single day. Sucks too because I’ve been wanting to go in my pool for like a week now but haven’t gotten much of a chance.
                        Just go into your pool anyway. After all if it rains you're already wet.
                            Is it weird that I like swimming in the rain more than swimming in bright sunshine? Just something about it.
                    It was so weird for me to move to England and find out it actually rains more in my home country!

I feel lied to
            If there's none then there's no risk
    Wait no rain? That IS a deal-breaker... Wait I already have the original Risk of Rain in my Steam library...
        to be fair it is called risk of rain not currently raining
            So... Tease of Rain?  Blue Rain Balls?  Rain That's Out Of Your League And You're Never Going To Get It And Both You And The Rain Know It But You Play Anyway?
                That last ones an r/suspiciouslyspecific from me
        It's got a whole extra dimension in it.
    It's not about the rain, it's about the RISK of rain. It's a game about the constant anxiety of wondering whether you should have worn a coat, or if you'll be ok without one.

A summary of life, living in the Pacific NW.
        Wait that's actually true.

The whole game is the anxiety of: "Should I hunt for more items or just activate the tele and get the fuck outta here before The Director screws me over".

Never thought of it like that before.
    There is but only on one level. Kind pf a deal breaker. /s
        Actually there can be rain in every level. You just have to play as Huntress.

Huntress has an ability called "Arrow **Rain**".
    NOOOOOOoooooooooooooooo. The first game had rain! They should rename it to Risk of Nice Daytime Stroll Wherein Monsters May or May Not Spawn Endlessly.
        To be fair, the "rain" was all the ship parts breaking up and landing on the planet. How else would you finding Electric Ukeleles. "And his music was electric."
        It's only the penultimate in the series. Expectation of Rain, Risk of Rain, and finally Relentless Rain
    You bought me

    Actually it is raining lightly in one of the levels

    Huntress' "Arrow Rain" ability: "Am I a joke to you?"
        Laughs in Ballista.
            that's why it's a risk, it's uncertain.
        When I play as Artificer, I'd say there's a risk of meteor showers with the occasional ball lightning from above.
        Actually yes. Ballista is the better pick 100% of the time.
    If i recall the devs mentioned somewhere that the title is a reference to the cargo ship exploding over whatever planet you're on raining down all the cargo and items you find
        Thank you, I'm so glad you mentioned that! I always assumed that's what the title was referencing, but I never saw that from the devs, and nobody else seemed to make the connection, so I thought maybe it was just me!
        You just exploded my fucking brain , compadre
        Wtf spoilers now there's no point in playing
        Played 1 and 2 and always knew this too so +1
    The username change, I liked that.
        I wonder if /u/AngryMeerkat actually exists.

They do but haven't done anything in years.
            And their only post and comment is about ball pits haha
                Well? Does anyone have an answer to his question?
                    Must be why s/he quit posting in reddit.
    There is rain Grafo, you just raining down damage!!
    Ha, angrymeerkat
Basically, you go from map-to-map killing enemies and buying stackable bonuses (i.e attack speed or X happens on kill). Every map has a portal which spawns a boss, you kill the boss and hold the point for X time, then you can go to the next map to rinse and repeat.. As time goes on enemies get harder and spawn in greater numbers. You can rush towards the next level, or take your time to get cash and purchase everything on the current map, but you're risking getting "washed out" by the "flood" of enemies.
    So.... Gauntlet?
        Oh God, I haven't played that in ages lol, but it's definitely along those lines.
            Nothing beats Gauntlet Legends though
                Except, of course, Gauntlet: Dark Legacy
                    I found a copy of that for like 2 bucks at a garage sale for the ps2. I had previously owned it on xbox but had long since lost it. I still remembered where every secret was and my SO was getting annoyed because she was completely lost. Still super fun.
                Blue JESTER...is about to die..
                    Sometimes when I'm hungry I hear a voice in my head "Red warrior needs food badly."
In terms of rain, there is no rain. 

(Try it out anyway)
It may not be the actual reason, but in the beginning of the first game a cargo ship is destroyed above a planet and countless random crates rain down onto it. I always figured that was it.
I think its a metaphor
I haven't played 2, but I played the first quite a bit. The devs are based in Seattle, and it's half a nod to the overwhelming numbers of enemies you face (I think), and half a nod to Seattle's weather.
It's based off where the devs live. The devs said the name comes from living in Seattle. Considering in Seattle, it's usually always raining. Hence, Risk of Rain.
    Man I always thought it was pretty clearly referring to what little story there was in the game. The chests and pods you find everywhere having rained down >!in the wreckage of the ship you escape in in the final level!<. But if the devs say it's just a weather joke, then color me unimpressed.

Still a fantastic game, of course.
It’s raining projectiles. And deaths.
From Wikipedia 
 > The title Risk of Rain was selected not only to allow the game to be easily searchable via the Internet, but came to allude to the concept of a single protagonist in the large game world always worried about "a risk of failure or bad things happening".[2]

    Risk of Rain 2 would be a sweet sponsorship.


Instead we're stuck with YouTubers sponsored by **Raid: Shadow Legends** (Try it on the app store today!)


^(this message brought to you by Raid: Shadow Legends)
        Well see here’s the thing, 

Raid shadow Legends isn’t a game. It’s an app that slowly tempts small minded people to give them money, for no reason. They barely have to spend a dime on the “game” itself, so they can pump out thousands in advertising.

Risk of Rain 2 is an actual video game with actual stuff to do and actual gameplay. A smaller game developer can’t do that because if they want their game to succeed, they have to do the right things and implement certain things to make it fun. Then people will buy it and then you’ve made your paycheck for the game. (Only considering smaller studios)
            Hopoo games is actually a very small team. The first game, as well as ROR2's early access build and first few updates were made by a 3 person dev team.
                Right, but Raid Shadow Legends isn’t an actual video game though. So they don’t really have much work to do. That’s what I’m getting at. 

RoR2 has a good dev team that brings us a good game. They deserve the price point for purchasing the game. 

Raid Shadow Legends is malware.
                    Oh, I'm an idiot and misread your first comment as the opposite of what you were saying. Yeah I totally agree with everything you said. Well put bud
                        Haha no problem dude, I figured you meant that! Hopefully what I said didn’t get conveyed as being as asshole, didn’t mean for that! 

Edit: outside of shitting on that trash heap of a “game”.

[EDIT](https://i.imgur.com/uSMwq0G.png)
    Haha, just start ok the lowest one for a while, as soon as you make it a hundred minutes in that one switch it up, do the same for normal to hard. (also try out the samurai dude called the Mercenary, he’s awesome, he doesn’t need to land on the ground, ever, late game)
        I thought the game was OK until I unlocked mercenary, I haven't fallen in love with a character's mechanics like that since Orianna from League of Legends.

My only complaint is I literally can't practice with that dude, my hand starts to cramp after an hour with how fast you need to be.
            I love Mercenary and the super punchy guy, the archer is pretty great too, but I can’t really get into Rex or the robot with two guns.
                Rex is fantastic once you understand that your M2 does all the damage, M1 is minor healing and R is major healing/crowd control. He's amazing once you understand how he works
                MUL-T was really tough for me to get into, but was also the first character I finished a Monsoon run with. Play with the Artifact of Command and pump some Goat Hooves into him, you may enjoy him once he's more mobile.
                    I do enjoy becoming speed itself in RoR2 whenever there is a Goat hoof printer or Soda printer.
                        With the artifact of command you can just make all the items you get be goat hoofs lol, you become dangerously fast, like falling of the map twenty times
            I’m also an Ori main, rejoice
    which of the characters is your favorite so far?
    The achievement to get to like stage 20 or something gets you the 57 leaf clover. Top tier legendario
[**EDIT**](https://i.imgur.com/1rwhY5i.png) *(also if youre a Commando, your blue laser go through enemies, so use it from far to hit the boss in the distance while defending yourself)*
    You should be able to sprint through the first 3 levels without spending any time looting... from there you NEED to slow down because the mobs will be too strong otherwise.
        I've been always looting everything from the start. Got all the characters unlocked and majority of the items. But then again I haven't played on monsoon that much.
            Yeah on monsoon you gotta plan it out a little bit. If you dawdle on the first 3 worlds you get fucked later. 

Later it's a balancing act of progressing through the worlds fast enough so that you don't get overwhelmed while grabbing enough loot to stay strong. 


If you find a good 3D printer or a legendary chest it is ok to stay though. I had a run with like 20 soldiers syringes + dmg items recently and it was amazing.
                I haven't been able to get past the fourth stage on Monsoon yet. I'm probably spending too much time looting in the previous stages. I always end up getting killed by the Elder Lemurians that start showing up at that time.
                    Basically just blitz the first 3 rounds. Then you can chill for a bit and loot. I believe in you
            I play exclusively on Monsoon, def want to get through the level quick but not avoid loot completely
        I'm not super familiar with the game, why would you skip through the levels like that without getting any upgrades?
            The game gets progressively harder with each minute the passes. In the earliest stages of the game its often better to level quickly as opposed to burning through the time to unlock all the loot boxes.

Monsters spawn so slow initially you'll be waiting around for them to spawn and waste time.

The 5 minutes you save going straight to the boss doesn't seem like a big deal, but a couple levels later when you're hit with a tougher enemies that are spawning faster and you might want those 5 minutes back.
    I know English isn’t your native language so FYI, the 1st “does,” is unnecessary. “What each item does,” would be correct.
        Holy shit! This dude isn't a native English speaker?!
        I'm pretty sure he actually just did that on accident.
    Also when you get your first artifact make sure it’s the artifact of command, then you can choose which items you get throughout the game
        i found artifact of command to utterly ruin the gameplay experience.  Customizing your build made the game much easier, but also took away the fun offered by the randomness of drops.  Also the interface was super clunky for such a fast paced game.
            Command saps the fun for me. I want to risk wax quails raining down on me.
        Oh no they updated with the Artifacts? Welp guess I gotta put more time in.
        Once you get command, build Will-o'-the-wisp (green) and pick up at least one ceremonial dagger (red). Then use white to build whatever is good for your character. I usually do 10 crit glasses, some teddy bears, other healing items, movement speed, and crowbars. At this point with a ton of wisps, you'll kill one mob and itll explode and kill everything around it. Anything that spawns soon after gets killed by the daggers from the last group. I usually pair Command with Soul, and Swarms as that will increase enemy spawn (more density for explosions). 


But like the other commenter said, command kinda takes away a lot of the fun because now I dont get to try other RNG builds.
            My friends have a pact of never getting ceremonial dagger because of how overpowered it is. Also, on command you don't need 10 crit glasses, items that give you crit bonuses like harvester scythe and predatory instinct give you a small amount of crit, 7-8 is plenty. Teddy bears and wax quails are an absolute must on monsoon with artifact of glass, unless you are playing engineer (in which case, dat sweet fungus), with command on, the only healing item that is really worth it is harvester scythes. There are a number of viable late game builds for monsoon but the easiest are status/death mark, sentient meat hook, missiles and willothewisps, and crit/crowbar/missiles. If you're doing all artefact monsoon runs, or the void fields, teddies are super important, as are armor plates, which also help with when you have to fight 4+ magma/overloading worms amd everything is awful. There are other builds of course, stacking razorwire on Rex is great, you basically just destroy everything in a huge radius. 

All artefact runs really make command much more balanced, but its not for the faint of heart (we usually turn artefact of death off because it is unfun in multi-player, it is hard enough already, and it becomes increasingly easier to accidentally teamkill). But watch out for the explosions. So many explosions. And those ice elites are really killer.
Learn enemies' attacks and how to dodge them. Movement is a huge part of the game. Also it's easy to get overwhelmed by smaller guys while fighting boss, especially as commando as he doesn't have that much of crowd control, but it's a rogue like. The most punishing and forgiving genre at the same time. Don't be afraid to experiment with items and strategies.
    Literally never stop jumping and strafing lol

Play in a group if you can
Check out whooliegaming on YouTube.
Focus on your character's strengths and do everything to build around those strengths.

I typically play as REX (the plant) and I do my damnedest to get as many teddy bears, brooches, and scythes as possible.

It also helps if you play with friends who understand the strengths of your characters, so you can leave items for each other.
    > It also helps if you play with friends who understand the strengths of your characters, so you can leave items for each other.

Or play with my friends where it's a free-for-all and you die inside when your Huntress keeps taking focus crystals from you as Merc.
        I have a buddy who does that sometimes. We always yell at him. Conversation goes something like this:

Friend 1 (Engineer): Why did you just pick up your 4th fungus? I don't have any yet.

Friend 2/Jerk (Acrid): Bruh, fungus are good for everyone.

(Next time we play)

Me (Rex): Dude, why do you keep picking up all the teddy bears? It's literally the only thing that keeps me from killing myself.

Friend/Jerk (Acrid): Everybody needs teddies.
            Taking my bungus as Engineer is grounds for getting unfriended on Steam.
                That's particularly egregious because if the Engineer has them it helps everyone.
                    Good thing we don't have to worry about it since the game decides not to spawn any bungus when there's an engi on the team.
                        aint that the truth.
keep moving! keep shooting! keep moving!
Biggest tip I would give is to never stop moving. Standing still is a big no-no in this game
Don't spend more than 5 minutes per level. Once you hit 3:30,activate the teleporter. Check out r/riskofrain!
The teleporter is always about as far away from your spawn point as it can be.

    [EDIT](https://i.imgur.com/DpuxxPl.png)
        Awesome! Well I know what I am going to play tonight.
     There are fragments of lore scattered about in both games if you're interested in lore related things, but there isn't otherwise any overarching storyline you'd need to worry about
        Thank you!
    Its a rogue like there isn't really a story. The second game is mostly a 3D remake of the first one
        There is a story!! You just have to piece it together from the encyclopedia magigers.
            Ok but is there a traditional plot this man can't follow without playing the first one or is that a bonus side lore thing?
        Thank you!
    Like others are saying, the story and lore comes form log entries for the different items you pick up.  


Basics of the first game's story is that a cargo ship was carrying an alien teleporter and an alien teleported onboard and proceeded to crash the ship. You played as one of the survivors of said ship, scavenging equipment that was onboard the cargo ship as you try to survive on an alien world.  


Second game's story isn't fully there yet since it won't be in 1.0 till August but it seems that the second game has members of a rescue ship that came to investigate the planet as well as some returning survivors from the first game.  


That's the basics of the story so you aren't missing too much and you can always go read the logs of the items and monsters from the first on the wiki if you're feeling bored/curious.
    The first one has a story but it's more of something you see as you play rather than it being something you have to know
    I was in the same situation you’re in a few months ago, and having played both extensively now, I can definitely recommend playing at least a little bit of risk of rain 1 before 2. Only took me like 4 hours to beat my first run, plus the 1st game has a final boss!
    I don't know if the digital or PC version is this way, but the physical console version of *Risk of Rain 2* includes the original *Risk of Rain.*
    Both games play almost identically, even though one is 2D and the other one 3D.  
Characters in Risk of Rain 2 feel like they have a lot more movement and freedom, while most abilities are only horizontal in the first Risk of Rain.
Other than that, the first part feels more arcadey and is still a lot of fun. The second part isn't completed yet and lacks a final level, while the first part has a pretty cool final boss.  
You can play them completely independent, but i would say Risk of Rain 2 makes an even better impression after having played the first part
    It was made by two engineering students in Gamemaker, he drew ALL of the artwork in MS Paint. It is a masterpiece all things considered, but takes a while to get really good at it. You have to understand that some runs are just doomed from the start and the permadeath feature is part of the game's flow. It gets hella intense towards the final level.
This comic is the funniest SirGrafo has ever made.  
That's not a joke, either.
[**EDIT**](https://i.imgur.com/0VKupxX.png) *~~(More like how many reposters Im gonna put out of work)~~*
    That's how I usually wind up stumbling across all kinds of games that I might never have looked twice at before. ...and why I like to browse the Indie sections more and more as time goes on.
        Hey another one like me! If you like pixel horror check out "The Count Lucanor" by Baroque Decay. They also made a sequel which I'm playing through right now called "Yuppie Psycho".

EDIT: Not a sequel! Just another game, sorry.
        Funny you mention "stumbling" across stuff. I first found Minecraft on the website StumbleUpon back when that was a big(ger) thing, thought it would be a neat toy and bought it early. Man has that been a *great* investment.
    If you have a few close friends and a computer, Crawl is a fun, local co-op, dungeon crawl, indie game where you compete with your friends to inhabit a human body and escape a dungeon.

Don't know if you already know the game, but thought I'd help with your game discovery.

Edit: It's on console too, so should be accessible. Nintendo Switch by far has to be the most beneficial, since there is no online play.
    OMG YES!!!

why does this sub is so obsessed with upvoting the same damn thing over and over again!!??

I understand different "few" people not seeing and posting it, but the up-voting in mass 4k+ upvotes that means is majority of those people already seen THAT last week or yesterday or 12 hours ago or 4h ago also!

Its just impossible to miss for majority of users, and yet there they are the same damn dub reposts upvoted to front page by the brainless  bandwagon
    A different genre (kinda) but check out slay the spire if you're into rogue likes.

Deck building, RNG, fun encounters.
They recently released the iOS version too. I'm patiently waiting for the android so I can never be productive at work ever again.
    Well in that case, if you like RoR2, I highly recommend Gunfire Reborn. It's a new roguelike shooter with a progression system, it kind of plays like Borderlands and RoR2 smashed together. I think the name is just a direct translation, the generic name doesn't do justice for how fun this game is.
    It really did fly under the radar. It's a shame that great indie games like this only really get exposure to people who already play their current titles. I only knew about the sequel from playing the first so much and it was on their steam news way back.
    Have you played the binding of isaac?
    I'm really enjoying your comic replies
    Sorry we haven't told you before! It has been cross-posted to r/riskofrain the devs are hopefully going to see it! Jump into the discord if you like.

And there is yet so much more to come. Both for the current state of the game you are exploring and until release (and hopefully even more after that).
    One of my friends doesn't like indie games, smh my head. Mechanics are the most important part of a game for me, and indie games are just soooo much more inventive. Glad to see RoR2 getting some love.

Games I'm playing rn: relaxing forest survival Among Trees (only on early access on epic rn), and Outer Wilds (not far in but it's managed to stay on my mind since the start)

Seconded. Not as content rich as Risk of Rain 2 yet, but damn is it fun.
    Not yet at least, it's still in early access and from the looks of the load screens, theres at least one more character on the way.
        Yeah and they're working tirelessly, judging from all the little updates.
Gunfire Reborn that new hotness.
SUPER. HOT.

SUPER. HOT.
    This guy SUPER HOTS.
Both mess with different element of the game. Risk of Rain (both 1 and 2) use time you spend in game to make enemies stronger so you have to balance your strategy. If you progress to quickly, you'll have less accessories that give you passive buffs and thus making you weaker but if you stay on one map for too long, your enemies will become stronger and might overpower you. It's a good rogue like.
Yes, SUPERHOT  is the most innovative shooter I have played in years.
I don't think there's anything innovative about RoR2 really. The mechanic that sets it apart (difficulty increases each 5min) the most was also in the first, released in 2013....and probably used in games before that.

But what it does, it does well. And the music is great. The team is tiny, which I respect. And despite being an early access game they've been open about everything from day 1 and they made true on their promises.
8 hours well spent.
There isn't one, I don't think any of his comics have one
    They definitely used to, but it's basically now just mundane observations and comments. Once you reach reddit celebrity status, though, you get automatic upvotes.
The joke is that people think this isn't an advertisement
    Recommendation is a form of advertisement
    I dunno, ROR2 is a pretty good game. I keep telling people to get it.

    How do you get competitive in this game of all things?

It's a team-based PvE.
Yes it is! And you don't have to go through awkward configuration and complicated setups like Risk of Rain had in the first game.
For anyone doing multiplayer, there are some pretty good mods out that allow you to share items you pick up. Makes it feel more co-op. If you hate your friends though, no need to mod.

Yeah. It's a lot of fun with a couple friends!
my experience with multiplayer is that once there are more than 100 enemies on screen, it's completely unplayable and freezes for 30+seconds.  Seen a lot of people complaining about that happening with no fixes suggested.  Doesn't happen on single player so no, it's not my hardware.  Also doesn't seem to be an issue for other people in the same lobby.  Ruined the game for me, but if anyone's heard of a fix I'd be very happy.
    Never had such problems and i've had 4 hour multiplayer runs that were relativly stable.

It all depends on the type of enemy you get; parents and elites are hard hitters and have frozen (permanently) a singleplayer run at 4 hours because a stage event forced only parents to spawn while the advanced time resulted in pretty much only elites.

Like u/snipercat94 mentioned, there is a narrative "end" to your run that you can choose to do when you get to that point.  It rewards you with a special kind of currency which lets you unlock special items in-game called Lunar items, which can be game-changingly powerful or detrimental.  And aside from that, there's a secret boss you can access via this system which is sort of meant as an "endgame" to your run.

However, it's worth mentioning that the full game isn't even out yet, and the first one *did* have a final boss named Providence.  The final boss for this game hasn't been revealed yet, but I would put money on them putting one in.
    For PC players there will be a final boss coming sometime in august when the game leaves early access. Along with that will come a whole new character, new enemies, new items, and the final stage for the final boss.
I mean, your end "goal" could be to end existential pain and "obliterate" yourself at the obelisk. In order to do so, you need to cycle trough the maps once, and then you have to last 3 more maps, and a "celestial portal" will open, where you can go in for obliterate yourself and end the run.  

So even if the game as of right now does not have a climatic ending (like "face a final boss -> run ends and credits roll), you could still take obliteration as the end goal.
Just to kill some time, I'll take a stab at it.

To start, I'm going to argue that there is actually a 100/0 chance, in the sense that you pointed out that it is either going to rain, or it's not. This is based on the assumption that weather is a deterministic system. Essentially what I'm saying is that, on any given day at a specific location, it is going to deterministically rain or not rain. On the days that it is deterministically going to rain, there is a 100% chance it will rain. On the days that it is deterministically not going to rain, there is a 0% chance it will rain.

The idea of determinism is basically that given a certain set of inputs to a system, there are predictable outputs. This also includes situations where we are currently not able to predict those outputs due to limited understanding of the system or limited knowledge of the inputs. So, while we can not accurately say whether a day is a deterministic rain day or not, we can say that there is a deterministic system that controls whether a day is a rain day, which would support the conclusion that the chance is 100% or 0%.

But is weather deterministic? Probably. In fact, not only is weather likely to be deterministic, but so is all of classical physics; that is, physics concerning things on a scale larger than individual atoms. Since weather is observed on such a scale, we can reasonably believe it to be deterministic.

So, up until this point, I have essentially agreed with you that it is either going to rain or it is not, which might make you think I should conclude that there is a 50/50 chance. There are two barriers to that conclusion, though.

First, science is largely based on observation. We can record the number of rainy days at any given location over a length of time and in that way know how many days are rainy and how many are not. For example, Mt Wai-'ale-'ale in Hawaii receives over 350 rainy days each year. Therefore, without any knowledge of the system that controls weather for that location, we can conclude that Mt Wai-'ale-'ale has an approximately 95.9% probability of precipitation on any given day, since 350/365≈0.959. Another way of looking at that number is to say that 95.9% of days include a deterministic system which we might not fully understand but will determine there to be rain (a 100% chance on those days) and 4.1% of days include that same deterministic system determining that there will not be rain (a 0% chance on those days). This still supports the idea that it is either going to rain or not rain, as you asserted, but points out that those two occurrences do not come with equal probability, as can be observed. We can extrapolate from the statistic about Mt Wai-'ale-'ale that any place on Earth has a probability of precipitation on any day of between 0% and 95.9% depending on whether it is a very dry place on Earth with approximately 0 days of rain per year, it is the wettest place on Earth with 350 days of rain per year, or any of the other places that fall somewhere in between.

Second, there is the complex system of weather itself. It is likely that it is a deterministic system. That is not to say in any way that we fully understand that system, as I am not a climatologist or a meteorologist and am not fully versed in the latest science on this topic so I cannot conclude one way or the other. It is also not to say that we fully know all the inputs to that system for the same reason. However, knowing that it is deterministic and that some days are just going to rain and some days are just not going to rain, it may become useful to be able to say, specifically, which days are which. As pointed out above, we can say over a larger time scale what the probability of precipitation is each day, but that is without specificity. So, how do we know which days it will deterministically rain? If you have lived in one area for at least a year you will probably have some sense that different times of year get more rain than others. You may know that there are places on Earth where people consider there to be a "wet season" and a "dry season". The differences between those can be pretty extreme in some areas. So, armed with that knowledge, we can probably recognize that it is not helpful to say that the chance of rain during a "dry season" is the same as the chance of rain during a "wet season". So, the yearly averages discussed above, while providing a valid probability of precipitation for each day over the course of a year would not be helpful. Through science, that is to say through observation and experimentation, we can determine not only what parts of the year are more wet or more dry, but we can also determine that some local or semi-local weather events are predictors for wet or dry periods to follow them. Given that weather is deterministic, if we fully understood it we could probably accurately conclude from such an event whether that system gives a day a 100% chance of rain or a 0% chance of rain, since it must rain or not rain at any given location on any day. However, it is likely that we do not fully understand that system and therefore we are limited by that understanding in our ability to say whether it will rain. We can say that while we do not fully understand the system to state whether a day will, 100%, rain, based on that system, we can hypothesize with a certain amount of confidence whether it will rain or not on a given day based on prior observations and rigorously tested predictive models. This means that while we cannot say whether a day will rain or not, we can say how confident we are with a prediction of rain on a given day, which, for ease of understanding and data consumption, can be described as the probability of precipitation on that day. Since there are things we wish to do day-to-day that may be affected by precipitation, these confidence values are likely to be more helpful than the averaged probability discussed above.

tl/dr:

So, to sum up: yes, it will either rain or not rain on any given day; no, that doesn't mean the chance is 50/50, but rather 100/0 based on some deterministic system we don't fully understand; through basic observation we can get somewhat accurate numbers to describe that deterministic system through averaging data observed over a long period of time, but that description may not be helpful; through a combination of observation and predictive modelling we can, with variable confidence, say whether it will rain; and these confidence numbers, while not a true indication of that probability, are often quite helpful and are easily understood as such.
    Spoiler: there’s zero rain in the game.
        Oh I know, lol.
            Hahaha well good on you then :D
    I appreciate the effort
It's supposed to have an 'end'. RoR1 had an end (though you could loop around the levels as many times as you wanted).
Pump it up to the highest difficulty and start using artifacts that make the gameplay more difficult and fun.
Haha yeah, Rex is kinda hard to unlock. My tip would be to try and unlock an equipment barrel on every stage, swap out, finish teleporter, go back to pick it up. The addition of Siren’s Call makes things so much more difficult though.
Not sure. I think they'll mention it after the news.
Darude: Sandstorm
What, this post or the whole subreddit?
    Both
        Leave. I did ages ago, happened by here with a crosspost.
It plays just like the first game but in 3d. Legitimately an upgrade in every way. Played for dozens of hours on launch week
There’s way worse things about Reddit.  Having said that, I was a big fan of his rimworld comic until he got his own subreddit. I feel like the comic kinda went a direction I didn’t like after that. I was subbed to his sub for a while but I realized there really wasn’t anything for me there and I was getting annoyed at how many times I’d see the same meme templates circulate in a week. Usually not even remotely funny. Sometimes I really do like what he puts out though and most of the time I dig how he responds to people with comics. I don’t think you’re wrong to be annoyed though.
13K upvotes and like 8 awards.... for a gaming recommendation?? I really don’t understand if he uses bots, or if his pre-teen fans are just this fucking dumb.
The fact that this is the top comment appearing on “controversial” comments is the worst thing about Reddit.
[deleted]
His porno memes that he aims towards teens are creepy imo.  Seems like a scumbag.
Hah, I play both
I'd like the 3d reply please
    We'll have to wait for Reddit 2
        Or JrGrafo.
            Isnt SrGrafo short for Señor Grafo, or is it senior
                I always read it in my head as “sir grafo”
                    Am I the only one who read it as Sargeant Graph I?
                        Yes
                I'm not sure tbh. I was just making a silly joke. We would have to ask the man himself for clarification.
                    Calling user u/srgrafo for clarification
                I always thought dude was a Brit and its "Sir Grafo"
                Psure its sir
                Makes me think of Señor Senior Sr from Kim Possible
                He's portuguese, so it's "senhor grafo". Here we abreviate it like this, senhor (portuguese for mister) to sr, like you do it from mister to mr.
            SrGrafoJr
Might be late to catch your attention in this random reply, but I've been really loving the mods for risk of rain 2. The Goku one (yes, dbz) is incredibly well made and there's another mod that creates random character classes to pick by mixing up models and abilities. 

For example, played one yesterday that let me walk around as the giant crawling oil pot and my abilities were (1) some fireball with 33 shots before cool down, (2) some slow moving projectile that exploded on contact, (3) self damaging ability that shot me backwards, (4) summon up to 3 crawling turrets. 

It's pretty epic.

--edit: mods are at https://thunderstore.io/ and the mod manager from there handles dependencies and things
    I'm gonna need to check that out. That second mod sounds insanely cool
        u/undeleteparent
        There's somewhere in the config you can set a seed so you can generate the same heroes every time if you want to play multiplayer with them, otherwise it's random every time the game starts up. It's pretty cool and some are broken bad or broken good. The one I tried there was probably the most powerful one, but some what balanced by being big and slow. 

The replay value in that mod is hard to put to words :)
            Is there a name for the mod that I can look for?
    Oh there’s workshop capability now? I haven’t played since it came out
        er, no - I'll edit the mod site into my first reply because it's neither steam nor the usual nexus. It's  [https://thunderstore.io/](https://thunderstore.io/)  and the mod manager from there handles it all :)
            Oh awesome I’m gonna have to do that! Saw a video and it looks super easy
                I'm using the random survivors mod and the goku mod. Both are awesome and work together despite warnings in the random mod that specific character mods may cause issues. Random survivors pretty much takes care of the content ever becoming stale since it creates a random set every time the game is launched. The goku mod is still worth checking out though because it is so well made - the model, the voice lines, the additional systems (transformations, energy meter, power level, etc). 

It's the most fun dbz gaming experience I've had and it's just a mod for another game.
                    you just awakened my dbz flame again bro. Its been a while since playing some DBFZ or some budokai lol im definitely doing it tonight
                        Just be sure to adjust his loadout. I prefer meteor crash to ki blast and charge to instant transmission. Using charge to scream raise your energy is the most DBZ thing ever. I believe the transformations go all the way up to kaioken x20 and super saiyan blue, both active at the same time lol.

Just read up carefully on the mechanics so you use 'em all and it's like.. damn, why can't regular dbz games be this good?
    I have not tried any of those, but now I gotta O\_o
        Goku has voicelines and additional mechanics. He's got a power level which lets you transform into various super saiyan and kaioken forms. He's also got loadouts so you can choose between things like kamehameha or spirit bomb. Oh and he can fly :P It's probably the best *dbz*  gameplay I've experienced and it's just a ROR mod lol
            Is it a steam community mod or nexxus or what?

&#x200B;

:o
                I edited it into my original reply. The risk of rain community seems to have their own website which is neither the steam workshop nor the usual nexus mod site. They've got  [https://thunderstore.io/](https://thunderstore.io/) and you're looking for something called RoR2ModManager by scottbot95. 

I grew up with mods and it's been rough since MW2 where modding more or less officially died for AAA games so more DLC can be sold / games die faster so more sequels can be made. Or undying shit like GTA V.
                    Oh I love modding, and I don't mind mod managers at all. I'd just never known about any that existed for RoR. I'm exiteeeed :D
                        It's the perfect game for them :) there's an api mod for RoR as well if you decide to try and make one. That goku one is very inspiring.
How many edits have you made that can be taken so far out of context?
Their only mistake was not leaving anything for Risk of Rain 3. They're out of dimensions!
    ... But they can make it VR. Oooooh.
        Now there's an idea!
This panel needs to be a reusable reaction. 😂
RoR was hard as fuck. RoR 2 is also hard, but in a more managable, steadily increasing fashion. You should play it.  


Matter of fact, if you (AND ONLY YOU, DANG IT.) reply to this message, I'll send you a steam code.
    Damn what!? That's a deal! Fuckin gamers man.. the best people ever. I absolutely promise I will play it.. given this super effective recommendation.

UPDATE: played all last night. it's phenomenal. I'll be paying this forward on u/Nytohan 's new sub r/PayItForwardGaming . Hey u/SrGrafo is there anyone in this thread that you think deserves to be surprised w/ a steam code?
        [removed]
            UPDATE: registered and installed!! Can not wait to play this after work. You, my friend, earned more than just internet karma today. Thank you!
                Sounds like someone just made a friend. That's heartwarming... I'm leaving the internet for today so it can't destroy the faith in humanity I just gained.
                    Hey, you go have an excellent day.

                    Ah shit you find me on steam? Wait is there online multiplayer or am I wooshing right now? (Steam username is same)
            Just letting you know, you sold a copy based on this as well.  If you like it enough to give it to an internet stranger, then that's a good enough recommend for me, and I bought it immediately.
                Oh god, that's more pressure than I was expecting.

I hope you like the game!
                    G'wan  git, ya heartwarmin' fucks.
                        The influence is strong today. This is good influence though, not social media influence. Wait, this is a form of social media. Shit.
                            Sr Grafo is an influencer!
                    If it makes you feel better, I read this series of comments and immediately went and bought it then immediately returned it, stating "Nytohan can't be trusted" as my reason.
                        I mean... that's not UNTRUE.
                    i own the game as well and just wanted to put my 2 cents in that i love it as well. have fun guys!
                    Honestly that went double for me. I get off work in 12 hours and I'm gonna be picking it up too. Let's do this shit.
            The gaming community is great sometimes
                Yeah that’s a huge sometimes.
            You know what, because you're a cool dude I'll buy the game as soon as I can.

People like you are why I love the gaming community.
            What a legend. God, The Last Of Us subreddit could use a dose of this kindness right now.
                Last of us subreddit is a reflection of the game, people tearing eachothers appart
        Fuckin *gamers* man. Fun fact, I got Fallout: NV in a similar way to this.
            Is New Vegas any good?
                Fantastic. The base game can go as low as $3 during sales and I’ve never had more fun patrolling the Mojave
                I think I’ve put close to 1000 hours into the game across 3 consoles and multiple play throughs, it’s my favorite fallout game
                Yeah. It's great. Not without bugs... but just great. I am actually replaying it now.
            I had someone gift me Oxygen Not Included in a similar way, too
        Would be fun if you liked it, and only if you really liked it, to also gift a key to semeone else, and if that person also likes it to gift it to another person, etc, etc
            Hey, I like this idea. A lot. Just set up a subreddit, /r/PayItForwardGaming.  
Need to set up how it works and all, but maybe this can be a thing.
    🏅 here’s a poor mans gold
        It's so much more meaningful because you made it yourself.
    I didn't expect to come across something so wholesome while reading Reddit, but here we are.
        "Be excellent to each other." -  *Bill S*. *Preston*, *Esq*.
    Risk of Rain was hard until you got the modifier that lets you pick what upgrade you want everytime you pick one up.  Once you know which upgrade is which and how effective they are, it's a relative cakewalk depending on what character you pick.  Some of them feel completely helpless solo.  Hit speed, leech on hit and leech on kill, overall HP increases... stuff like that turns you into a tank in no time and from there you pick stuff that ups damage either directly or indirectly.  Chef with that stuff is practically invincible from the crazy amounts of leech on hit.  I love watching like 30 homing rockets shoot out into the sky and rain down on enemies every time I open a chest.
    I haven't played either one, which should I play first?
        Honestly, Risk of Rain didn't grab me like RoR 2, but go check out some videos. We all have our own preferences!
        There isn't really an important continuity to it. There IS a bit of story behind it all in the Dark Souls way. But like Dark Souls, playing them in any order won't really change your experience of it.  


It really comes down to which you enjoy more, 2D or 3D. Some people find one or the other much harder to grapple with.
        If you like 2D platformers, the original is good fun. If you're more into 3D shooters, then RoR2 is fantastic.
    Take this platinum and get out of here you beautiful bastard you.
        Why anyone would spend money on an internet stranger is beyond me, but thank you! :)
    Codes or it didn't happen...
        I mean, I can give you the now used steam code...
As someone who played ror2 before the first game, the first game is way harder to get into I feel. I've never been good at 2d combat games like terraria or starbound though so that may explain why the easiest difficulty in the first game felt like the hardest difficulty in the second game to me. An important thing to note, there are difficulty levels life the first game and the hardest difficulty level is only required for cosmetic "mastery" skins for each character.
    I tried 1 first and I just couldn't get the hang of controlling a character the size of like 4 pixels, I could barely last 5 minutes.  I was able to play for over 90 minutes first run on 2.
I loved risk of rain, but found the second one to be too hard.

I'm a pretty casual gamer though. I just sucked at the 3d movement.
    God I'm the exact opposite. So many years of playing RoR1, RoR2 feels stupid easy in comparison. I'm good at shooters though so that might be it.
        Yeah I suck at shooters.
            You should play the huntress then. She's really good for people who aren't great at 3d shooting.
        It's so much harder to dodge in RoR2 though. In 1 you just need to jump, in 2 the enemies have aimbots that are always targeting you so you need to either kill them or get behind something to avoid them.
            It's really mostly lesser wisps, to be honest. No other enemy in the game has a body count near as high, I'm sure of it.
                I found that its just because the game is balanced to prevent god runs more. They still happen but you're more likely to die before you can get a build that is truly unkilleable.
                Even when you’re not running Shaped Glass, the bastards will kill you. Especially Blazing ones.
            The trick is positioning, movement, and prioritizing wisps until you have will'o'wisps or some ukuleles. You should always be moving to place the enemy at your maximum engagement range and minimizing how surrounded you are, merc has iframes to deal and loader should be moving in and out quickly. Fighting under a hoard of wisps is a great way to eat shit. These days I mostly play with Artifact of Glass, so I might be biased, but it's always better to move to a more advantageous spot than brawl it out.
    Shit I'm out then. Same thing happened to me and Hotline Miami 2. If I can't actually finish a game it just haunts me.
        Be like me and just play with command, and try and do wacky things. I have never looped a monsoon without it, but ill keep trying. Until then ill keep messing around and having fun with command.
        Well there is no beating Risk of Rain 2, it just keeps getting harder til you lose. (There are difficulty settings for how fast it ramps up).
            There is technically ways to "win". Gotta get through the blue portal.
                Celestial portal, I think blue goes to the friendly lizard wizard
        I got 99.9% completion on Spyro when I was a kid, all I had left was one dragon and a few gems in the Treetops level which I kept struggling to reach. One day my memory card was full and I accidentally deleted the save freeing up space for another game.

More recently I picked up Spyro: Reignited but I still never managed to get to that platform on Treetops, and I don't play PS4 much these days anyway.
        Argh man that army camp level still gives me nightmares. Stick with it though you'll do it.
Have you tried nuclear throne?
    Nah but my buddy has it in our family share dealio.. what's up with it?
        I've never beat it. I've beat every rouge lite I play, but not nuclear throne.
It depends on if you play with the seals or not. There are some insanely fun combinations. Being able to pick items, then eventually ramp up to unlimited use items is really fun. Especially when one of the use items gives you more items so you can destroy everything.

I definitely have not spent 4 hours in 1 game just ramping items so I can beat the boss instantly with barbed wire by existing.
What you think of Dark Souls? (Any)
RoR2 gets me to a point of being unkillable more often than RoR did. Even then though, I will still eventually die, even if it take three hours.
I am not a fan. Tried it for a few hours, but it does not click.
I haven't played it yet but I'm hoping the soundtrack is as good as the first one. They brought back the same guy so I hope it is. He also did some great work on Deadbolt, another 2D game by the same studio.
    Yes! Chris is an amazing artist. The music in 2 SLAPS my guy. It is just as top tier as 1, with some motifs and nods to it as well. I played deadbolt just to hear his music! He’s truly wonderful.
Haven't played 2 but Risk of Rain 1 is also really really good, albeit pretty different from 2
    Ror2 is literally ror1 but in a 3d world. If you enjoy ror1 I highly recommend ror2. Just keep in mind it's moderately early Access, so it's not perfectly fleshed out. There are also changes to certain items and stuff.

Oh god what did I start here.
        The next update will be the end of early access. I think it's dropping soon.

*Spelling
            Bought it day one, played a few hours and decided to wait until it is out of early access.  Still was tons of fun tho.
                Its a ton of fun, but it takes forever to unlock characters. Its also not clear how to unlock them all.
                    Well I mean they are hidden on purpose.
                    i would say you're good to go ahead and look up how to unlock them - the first few characters i unlocked just by playing the game in my first 7 or so runs i reckon.  


once you get into it, you'd have to actively avoid working out/finding out how to unlock the characters.  


the artifacts however... wow there's a bit of a puzzle and also a lot of work.
                    Exactly like RoR1. Great series.
                    Google makes it very clear. And if it still too difficult I recommend using mods once to unlock new characters. I agree they need to do better with explaining how to unlock them though.
                    [deleted]
                        Thats a great idea!
                    I find it super difficult!!
                    I just edited my save to unlock all the characters. I told my friends to do the same. The game's more fun when you find a character you like. That first one (? I don't remember) and Huntress are fine and all but imo, are among the most boring characters. They might be your only characters after 5 hours of play too if you're doing things blind.
                    It is **pretty** clear. I've owned it for write some time. Maybe you didn't look in the logs?
                I've been playing on/off since day one and I must say, go ahead and pick it back up, it's loads and loads of fun. And you'll definitely see the love that's gone in to it. Especially if you played 1 :)
                yeah, I loved 1 and bought 2 just to re-reward the developers. I fully expected the move to 3D to ruin it.

Played a few hours at the beginning of Early Access and was really surprised at how well the mechanics translated. Then I put it down because it's worth waiting for fewer bugs and more features.

Basically, it's the poster child for how Early Access should work.
            August
            August is 1.0.
            What's the status on difficulty?  I played a ton when it first dropped and had a great time, then the update dropped that retooled difficulty and it was suddenly absolutely crushingly hard.  Like an order of magnitude more difficult, even at the normal difficulty.

Have they balanced that out at all?  My friends and I were getting absolutely demolished, to the point where it was a lot less fun compared to when it first launched.
            August is the 1.0 release, I'm really excited
            Sounds like a possibility of a sale! Hopefully there's a sale on switch too

    Very different. It's also pretty fun from the time I've had playing it. If you prefer a third person shooter then it's your game. Wisps are also deadlier somehow...
        It's different... While being the exact same game somehow
            Yes, which is why it's one of my highly recommended games as well. The only game I know of with a better 2D->3D jump was GTA.
    Nah, my biggest gripe with ROR2 is that it's literally just ROR1 but 3d which, IMO, hurts the experience. I enjoyed 1 a far deal greater because it's very difficult to wrap your head around enemies coming at you from 360°.

But that's just preferences on my part. It's still a very good game.

Cute
Damn, the rain previously known as purple is a stunningly beautiful track.
    Great name too
        Not a very subtle reference to Purple Rain by Prince, I love it

Purple Rain guitar solo is in there too
The music is what really got me into the game. It has excellent gameplay, but combined with the OST and it's one of those games you just love to sit down a waste a couple hours playing.
    My only complaint is that it absolutely devours time.
        Me: I'll just do a quick run on easy and screw around. 

137 minutes into the run: fuk.
        i just wish there was a functionality to save mid run and continue at another time
            There are so many mods, check it out, saves you at the start of each stage.

https://thunderstore.io/package/KingEnderBrine/ProperSave/
        I did an endless run in RoR1 that lasted about 20 hours. I put on the cheat to pick my drops and wanted to see just how OP I could get. Turns out you can be pretty much invincible.
    9PM: I'll just play a quick game of RoR2 before bed

2:35AM: fuck
Oh yeah the music is a solid 10/10
When I booted up Risk of rain 2, years after playing risk of rain 1 (and loving it), the menu music gave me chills
Check out Iji and Chris Geehan. How that was released for free just absolutely blows my mind. 

[It's a slow burn. Let it simmer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c0Ha-O09aY)

Better yet, play the game. It's better with context.
    Oh hey, amusing to run across this as I am listening to a [remix of Tor's theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CBOU-42eJE)
        I must assume you're a pretty rad person.
This dude is a mad genius. The unusual time signatures, the weird and wavy instruments, the funky beats and not to mention the incredible keyboard melodies that sometimes sounds like he just rolls his hands across the keyboard. It's perfection
And I love it.
I highly recommend you do. They have added tons of secrets and new characters in that time.
    Yeah part of why I decided to wait awhile was so that I could play through a ton of new content, instead of just playing through new content as it came out and potentially getting bored.

I wanted it to feel more like the original when I played that, where there was already most of the game in place.
        If you want a huge change, somebody upthread said that they are working on the "out of early access" patch, so it might be worth checking their blog or whatever -- if you've already waited a year, a month or so might not be a big wait (I know nothing about their timeline, it is just a thought). 

OTOH they did add many of the classic artifacts from 1, so there's definitely enough new stuff to play through.
People be downvotin, but rest assured the players of this game understand you.

And we feel your pain.
    The worst thing with the game is that if you don't die, your PC will eventually.
        Yup, crashed game at 4:30:00 in and 4:35:00 so its a fine line apparently lol
    Looks like people in the know corrected that one quick.
*TFW you’re two hours into a run and the trash enemies are being replaced by bosses*
Are you Tidus?
I'M COMING
Darn engineers stealing all the fungus.
    Who else do you want to have it? The artificer?
Yes but there is a rare item that gives you an extra life. The game is about getting as far as you can.
    I always forget I have one of those. Whenever I get revived I instantly die again.
it's a "rogue lite". if you're not familiar with the genre there is random loot, perma-death, and no saving. But you can complete achievements to unlock more types of loot and characters.
Yes. The gameplay consists of gaining items to make your character more powerful while the difficulty increases every second. It's not a game you can really win. The challenge is to see how far you can go.
The whole progression of the game is to unlock more stuff for the next run. It's part of the rougelike experience.
    I mean I understand the rogue like mechanics but the idea of unlocking is fairly limited in RoR. Not all higher tier skills are more viable than the base skills and there are a few separate classes to unlock. 

I enjoy the game. 

I like it a lot. 

I think it has really sweet coop for couch playing. 

I just never found their idea of progression to be very interesting or fun.
        Fair enough, haven't really tested it out lately so I haven't really checked out the newest stuff. Had a blast when it came out but even then it was some stuff that was a bit grindy/hard to unlock without external help.
            I just used this website. https://tbfts.github.io/ror2_save_editor/ to edit my save and give me all unlocks.

It's a roguelike so you still need to get lucky to have a good playthrough but with everything unlocked at least you know all items and abilities are available to you during your run.
Fake advertisement, count me out!

No need for lies.
    No rain, just the constant risk that there might be some
        Sounds like the average summer day where I live
            A fellow Brit I see.
                Central Canada actually. Usually we don’t get too much rain but the last month has been really stormy and there has been a risk of rain almost every single day. Sucks too because I’ve been wanting to go in my pool for like a week now but haven’t gotten much of a chance.
                    Just go into your pool anyway. After all if it rains you're already wet.
                        Is it weird that I like swimming in the rain more than swimming in bright sunshine? Just something about it.
                It was so weird for me to move to England and find out it actually rains more in my home country!

I feel lied to
        If there's none then there's no risk
Wait no rain? That IS a deal-breaker... Wait I already have the original Risk of Rain in my Steam library...
    to be fair it is called risk of rain not currently raining
        So... Tease of Rain?  Blue Rain Balls?  Rain That's Out Of Your League And You're Never Going To Get It And Both You And The Rain Know It But You Play Anyway?
            That last ones an r/suspiciouslyspecific from me
    It's got a whole extra dimension in it.
It's not about the rain, it's about the RISK of rain. It's a game about the constant anxiety of wondering whether you should have worn a coat, or if you'll be ok without one.

A summary of life, living in the Pacific NW.
    Wait that's actually true.

The whole game is the anxiety of: "Should I hunt for more items or just activate the tele and get the fuck outta here before The Director screws me over".

Never thought of it like that before.
There is but only on one level. Kind pf a deal breaker. /s
    Actually there can be rain in every level. You just have to play as Huntress.

Huntress has an ability called "Arrow **Rain**".
NOOOOOOoooooooooooooooo. The first game had rain! They should rename it to Risk of Nice Daytime Stroll Wherein Monsters May or May Not Spawn Endlessly.
    To be fair, the "rain" was all the ship parts breaking up and landing on the planet. How else would you finding Electric Ukeleles. "And his music was electric."
    It's only the penultimate in the series. Expectation of Rain, Risk of Rain, and finally Relentless Rain
You bought me
_**Oi Josuke, ain't it crazy how SrGrafo just say the word [“EDIT”](

    I knew it, even before I clicked. And yet I still clicked
    Ain't that wacky?
Actually it is raining lightly in one of the levels
A Pole
    Ah, so how tall are you 2 meters 3 meters
        More like 2. And before you ask I am a South Pole, not a North Pole
[deleted]
Uh, no. Poland says hello though
Huntress' "Arrow Rain" ability: "Am I a joke to you?"
    Laughs in Ballista.
        that's why it's a risk, it's uncertain.
    When I play as Artificer, I'd say there's a risk of meteor showers with the occasional ball lightning from above.
    Actually yes. Ballista is the better pick 100% of the time.
If i recall the devs mentioned somewhere that the title is a reference to the cargo ship exploding over whatever planet you're on raining down all the cargo and items you find
    Thank you, I'm so glad you mentioned that! I always assumed that's what the title was referencing, but I never saw that from the devs, and nobody else seemed to make the connection, so I thought maybe it was just me!
    You just exploded my fucking brain , compadre
    Wtf spoilers now there's no point in playing
    Played 1 and 2 and always knew this too so +1
The username change, I liked that.
    I wonder if /u/AngryMeerkat actually exists.

They do but haven't done anything in years.
        And their only post and comment is about ball pits haha
            Well? Does anyone have an answer to his question?
                Must be why s/he quit posting in reddit.
There is rain Grafo, you just raining down damage!!
Ha, angrymeerkat
So.... Gauntlet?
    Oh God, I haven't played that in ages lol, but it's definitely along those lines.
        Nothing beats Gauntlet Legends though
            Except, of course, Gauntlet: Dark Legacy
                I found a copy of that for like 2 bucks at a garage sale for the ps2. I had previously owned it on xbox but had long since lost it. I still remembered where every secret was and my SO was getting annoyed because she was completely lost. Still super fun.
            Blue JESTER...is about to die..
                Sometimes when I'm hungry I hear a voice in my head "Red warrior needs food badly."
Man I always thought it was pretty clearly referring to what little story there was in the game. The chests and pods you find everywhere having rained down >!in the wreckage of the ship you escape in in the final level!<. But if the devs say it's just a weather joke, then color me unimpressed.

Still a fantastic game, of course.
Risk of Rain 2 would be a sweet sponsorship.


Instead we're stuck with YouTubers sponsored by **Raid: Shadow Legends** (Try it on the app store today!)


^(this message brought to you by Raid: Shadow Legends)
    Well see here’s the thing, 

Raid shadow Legends isn’t a game. It’s an app that slowly tempts small minded people to give them money, for no reason. They barely have to spend a dime on the “game” itself, so they can pump out thousands in advertising.

Risk of Rain 2 is an actual video game with actual stuff to do and actual gameplay. A smaller game developer can’t do that because if they want their game to succeed, they have to do the right things and implement certain things to make it fun. Then people will buy it and then you’ve made your paycheck for the game. (Only considering smaller studios)
        Hopoo games is actually a very small team. The first game, as well as ROR2's early access build and first few updates were made by a 3 person dev team.
            Right, but Raid Shadow Legends isn’t an actual video game though. So they don’t really have much work to do. That’s what I’m getting at. 

RoR2 has a good dev team that brings us a good game. They deserve the price point for purchasing the game. 

Raid Shadow Legends is malware.
                Oh, I'm an idiot and misread your first comment as the opposite of what you were saying. Yeah I totally agree with everything you said. Well put bud
                    Haha no problem dude, I figured you meant that! Hopefully what I said didn’t get conveyed as being as asshole, didn’t mean for that! 

Edit: outside of shitting on that trash heap of a “game”.

A shill who doesn't even get paid smh /s
Haha, just start ok the lowest one for a while, as soon as you make it a hundred minutes in that one switch it up, do the same for normal to hard. (also try out the samurai dude called the Mercenary, he’s awesome, he doesn’t need to land on the ground, ever, late game)
    I thought the game was OK until I unlocked mercenary, I haven't fallen in love with a character's mechanics like that since Orianna from League of Legends.

My only complaint is I literally can't practice with that dude, my hand starts to cramp after an hour with how fast you need to be.
        I love Mercenary and the super punchy guy, the archer is pretty great too, but I can’t really get into Rex or the robot with two guns.
            Rex is fantastic once you understand that your M2 does all the damage, M1 is minor healing and R is major healing/crowd control. He's amazing once you understand how he works
            MUL-T was really tough for me to get into, but was also the first character I finished a Monsoon run with. Play with the Artifact of Command and pump some Goat Hooves into him, you may enjoy him once he's more mobile.
                I do enjoy becoming speed itself in RoR2 whenever there is a Goat hoof printer or Soda printer.
                    With the artifact of command you can just make all the items you get be goat hoofs lol, you become dangerously fast, like falling of the map twenty times
        I’m also an Ori main, rejoice
which of the characters is your favorite so far?
The achievement to get to like stage 20 or something gets you the 57 leaf clover. Top tier legendario
You should be able to sprint through the first 3 levels without spending any time looting... from there you NEED to slow down because the mobs will be too strong otherwise.
    I've been always looting everything from the start. Got all the characters unlocked and majority of the items. But then again I haven't played on monsoon that much.
        Yeah on monsoon you gotta plan it out a little bit. If you dawdle on the first 3 worlds you get fucked later. 

Later it's a balancing act of progressing through the worlds fast enough so that you don't get overwhelmed while grabbing enough loot to stay strong. 


If you find a good 3D printer or a legendary chest it is ok to stay though. I had a run with like 20 soldiers syringes + dmg items recently and it was amazing.
            I haven't been able to get past the fourth stage on Monsoon yet. I'm probably spending too much time looting in the previous stages. I always end up getting killed by the Elder Lemurians that start showing up at that time.
                Basically just blitz the first 3 rounds. Then you can chill for a bit and loot. I believe in you
        I play exclusively on Monsoon, def want to get through the level quick but not avoid loot completely
    I'm not super familiar with the game, why would you skip through the levels like that without getting any upgrades?
        The game gets progressively harder with each minute the passes. In the earliest stages of the game its often better to level quickly as opposed to burning through the time to unlock all the loot boxes.

Monsters spawn so slow initially you'll be waiting around for them to spawn and waste time.

The 5 minutes you save going straight to the boss doesn't seem like a big deal, but a couple levels later when you're hit with a tougher enemies that are spawning faster and you might want those 5 minutes back.
I know English isn’t your native language so FYI, the 1st “does,” is unnecessary. “What each item does,” would be correct.
    Holy shit! This dude isn't a native English speaker?!
    I'm pretty sure he actually just did that on accident.
Also when you get your first artifact make sure it’s the artifact of command, then you can choose which items you get throughout the game
    i found artifact of command to utterly ruin the gameplay experience.  Customizing your build made the game much easier, but also took away the fun offered by the randomness of drops.  Also the interface was super clunky for such a fast paced game.
        Command saps the fun for me. I want to risk wax quails raining down on me.
    Oh no they updated with the Artifacts? Welp guess I gotta put more time in.
    Once you get command, build Will-o'-the-wisp (green) and pick up at least one ceremonial dagger (red). Then use white to build whatever is good for your character. I usually do 10 crit glasses, some teddy bears, other healing items, movement speed, and crowbars. At this point with a ton of wisps, you'll kill one mob and itll explode and kill everything around it. Anything that spawns soon after gets killed by the daggers from the last group. I usually pair Command with Soul, and Swarms as that will increase enemy spawn (more density for explosions). 


But like the other commenter said, command kinda takes away a lot of the fun because now I dont get to try other RNG builds.
        My friends have a pact of never getting ceremonial dagger because of how overpowered it is. Also, on command you don't need 10 crit glasses, items that give you crit bonuses like harvester scythe and predatory instinct give you a small amount of crit, 7-8 is plenty. Teddy bears and wax quails are an absolute must on monsoon with artifact of glass, unless you are playing engineer (in which case, dat sweet fungus), with command on, the only healing item that is really worth it is harvester scythes. There are a number of viable late game builds for monsoon but the easiest are status/death mark, sentient meat hook, missiles and willothewisps, and crit/crowbar/missiles. If you're doing all artefact monsoon runs, or the void fields, teddies are super important, as are armor plates, which also help with when you have to fight 4+ magma/overloading worms amd everything is awful. There are other builds of course, stacking razorwire on Rex is great, you basically just destroy everything in a huge radius. 

All artefact runs really make command much more balanced, but its not for the faint of heart (we usually turn artefact of death off because it is unfun in multi-player, it is hard enough already, and it becomes increasingly easier to accidentally teamkill). But watch out for the explosions. So many explosions. And those ice elites are really killer.
Literally never stop jumping and strafing lol

Play in a group if you can
> It also helps if you play with friends who understand the strengths of your characters, so you can leave items for each other.

Or play with my friends where it's a free-for-all and you die inside when your Huntress keeps taking focus crystals from you as Merc.
    I have a buddy who does that sometimes. We always yell at him. Conversation goes something like this:

Friend 1 (Engineer): Why did you just pick up your 4th fungus? I don't have any yet.

Friend 2/Jerk (Acrid): Bruh, fungus are good for everyone.

(Next time we play)

Me (Rex): Dude, why do you keep picking up all the teddy bears? It's literally the only thing that keeps me from killing myself.

Friend/Jerk (Acrid): Everybody needs teddies.
        Taking my bungus as Engineer is grounds for getting unfriended on Steam.
            That's particularly egregious because if the Engineer has them it helps everyone.
                Good thing we don't have to worry about it since the game decides not to spawn any bungus when there's an engi on the team.
                    aint that the truth.
You’re a neat guy, my dude. 

Also, I’ve finally been touched by SrGrafo
    Hot?
        Possibly r/SuddenlyGay
            Ain't nothing wrong with that.
                I never said it was wrong tho?
    Show us where he touched you
        It’s okay I kinda liked it
I prefer playing Probability of Precipitation 2

[EDIT](https://i.imgur.com/DpuxxPl.png)
    Awesome! Well I know what I am going to play tonight.
 There are fragments of lore scattered about in both games if you're interested in lore related things, but there isn't otherwise any overarching storyline you'd need to worry about
    Thank you!
Its a rogue like there isn't really a story. The second game is mostly a 3D remake of the first one
    There is a story!! You just have to piece it together from the encyclopedia magigers.
        Ok but is there a traditional plot this man can't follow without playing the first one or is that a bonus side lore thing?
    Thank you!
Like others are saying, the story and lore comes form log entries for the different items you pick up.  


Basics of the first game's story is that a cargo ship was carrying an alien teleporter and an alien teleported onboard and proceeded to crash the ship. You played as one of the survivors of said ship, scavenging equipment that was onboard the cargo ship as you try to survive on an alien world.  


Second game's story isn't fully there yet since it won't be in 1.0 till August but it seems that the second game has members of a rescue ship that came to investigate the planet as well as some returning survivors from the first game.  


That's the basics of the story so you aren't missing too much and you can always go read the logs of the items and monsters from the first on the wiki if you're feeling bored/curious.
The first one has a story but it's more of something you see as you play rather than it being something you have to know
I was in the same situation you’re in a few months ago, and having played both extensively now, I can definitely recommend playing at least a little bit of risk of rain 1 before 2. Only took me like 4 hours to beat my first run, plus the 1st game has a final boss!
I don't know if the digital or PC version is this way, but the physical console version of *Risk of Rain 2* includes the original *Risk of Rain.*
Both games play almost identically, even though one is 2D and the other one 3D.  
Characters in Risk of Rain 2 feel like they have a lot more movement and freedom, while most abilities are only horizontal in the first Risk of Rain.
Other than that, the first part feels more arcadey and is still a lot of fun. The second part isn't completed yet and lacks a final level, while the first part has a pretty cool final boss.  
You can play them completely independent, but i would say Risk of Rain 2 makes an even better impression after having played the first part
It was made by two engineering students in Gamemaker, he drew ALL of the artwork in MS Paint. It is a masterpiece all things considered, but takes a while to get really good at it. You have to understand that some runs are just doomed from the start and the permadeath feature is part of the game's flow. It gets hella intense towards the final level.
That's how I usually wind up stumbling across all kinds of games that I might never have looked twice at before. ...and why I like to browse the Indie sections more and more as time goes on.
    Hey another one like me! If you like pixel horror check out "The Count Lucanor" by Baroque Decay. They also made a sequel which I'm playing through right now called "Yuppie Psycho".

EDIT: Not a sequel! Just another game, sorry.
    Funny you mention "stumbling" across stuff. I first found Minecraft on the website StumbleUpon back when that was a big(ger) thing, thought it would be a neat toy and bought it early. Man has that been a *great* investment.
If you have a few close friends and a computer, Crawl is a fun, local co-op, dungeon crawl, indie game where you compete with your friends to inhabit a human body and escape a dungeon.

Don't know if you already know the game, but thought I'd help with your game discovery.

Edit: It's on console too, so should be accessible. Nintendo Switch by far has to be the most beneficial, since there is no online play.
OMG YES!!!

why does this sub is so obsessed with upvoting the same damn thing over and over again!!??

I understand different "few" people not seeing and posting it, but the up-voting in mass 4k+ upvotes that means is majority of those people already seen THAT last week or yesterday or 12 hours ago or 4h ago also!

Its just impossible to miss for majority of users, and yet there they are the same damn dub reposts upvoted to front page by the brainless  bandwagon
A different genre (kinda) but check out slay the spire if you're into rogue likes.

Deck building, RNG, fun encounters.
They recently released the iOS version too. I'm patiently waiting for the android so I can never be productive at work ever again.
Well in that case, if you like RoR2, I highly recommend Gunfire Reborn. It's a new roguelike shooter with a progression system, it kind of plays like Borderlands and RoR2 smashed together. I think the name is just a direct translation, the generic name doesn't do justice for how fun this game is.
It really did fly under the radar. It's a shame that great indie games like this only really get exposure to people who already play their current titles. I only knew about the sequel from playing the first so much and it was on their steam news way back.
Have you played the binding of isaac?
I'm really enjoying your comic replies
Sorry we haven't told you before! It has been cross-posted to r/riskofrain the devs are hopefully going to see it! Jump into the discord if you like.

And there is yet so much more to come. Both for the current state of the game you are exploring and until release (and hopefully even more after that).
One of my friends doesn't like indie games, smh my head. Mechanics are the most important part of a game for me, and indie games are just soooo much more inventive. Glad to see RoR2 getting some love.

Games I'm playing rn: relaxing forest survival Among Trees (only on early access on epic rn), and Outer Wilds (not far in but it's managed to stay on my mind since the start)
[BOO!](https://i.imgur.com/z8jofnR.png)
Nah, I usually focus on my beetle guard instead of actual enemies every now and then.
What's anti-breathe?  Is that drowning?
    More of asphyxiation
        But then how do you eat a cookie after anti-breathing?
            Idk choke it down?
Not yet at least, it's still in early access and from the looks of the load screens, theres at least one more character on the way.
    Yeah and they're working tirelessly, judging from all the little updates.
This guy SUPER HOTS.
They definitely used to, but it's basically now just mundane observations and comments. Once you reach reddit celebrity status, though, you get automatic upvotes.
Recommendation is a form of advertisement
I dunno, ROR2 is a pretty good game. I keep telling people to get it.
Well, sir, there's nothin' on Earth like a genuine bona-fide electrified six-car monorail!
What'd I say?
    MONORAIL
Time 256:39  ....HAHAHAHA....

How do you get competitive in this game of all things?

It's a team-based PvE.
Never had such problems and i've had 4 hour multiplayer runs that were relativly stable.

It all depends on the type of enemy you get; parents and elites are hard hitters and have frozen (permanently) a singleplayer run at 4 hours because a stage event forced only parents to spawn while the advanced time resulted in pretty much only elites.

Try to have the person with the best computer host the server
For PC players there will be a final boss coming sometime in august when the game leaves early access. Along with that will come a whole new character, new enemies, new items, and the final stage for the final boss.
Spoiler: there’s zero rain in the game.
    Oh I know, lol.
        Hahaha well good on you then :D
I appreciate the effort
Both
    Leave. I did ages ago, happened by here with a crosspost.
We'll have to wait for Reddit 2
    Or JrGrafo.
        Isnt SrGrafo short for Señor Grafo, or is it senior
            I always read it in my head as “sir grafo”
                Am I the only one who read it as Sargeant Graph I?
                    Yes
            I'm not sure tbh. I was just making a silly joke. We would have to ask the man himself for clarification.
                Calling user u/srgrafo for clarification
            I always thought dude was a Brit and its "Sir Grafo"
            Psure its sir
            Makes me think of Señor Senior Sr from Kim Possible
            He's portuguese, so it's "senhor grafo". Here we abreviate it like this, senhor (portuguese for mister) to sr, like you do it from mister to mr.
        SrGrafoJr
I'm gonna need to check that out. That second mod sounds insanely cool
    u/undeleteparent
    There's somewhere in the config you can set a seed so you can generate the same heroes every time if you want to play multiplayer with them, otherwise it's random every time the game starts up. It's pretty cool and some are broken bad or broken good. The one I tried there was probably the most powerful one, but some what balanced by being big and slow. 

The replay value in that mod is hard to put to words :)
        Is there a name for the mod that I can look for?
Oh there’s workshop capability now? I haven’t played since it came out
    er, no - I'll edit the mod site into my first reply because it's neither steam nor the usual nexus. It's  [https://thunderstore.io/](https://thunderstore.io/)  and the mod manager from there handles it all :)
        Oh awesome I’m gonna have to do that! Saw a video and it looks super easy
            I'm using the random survivors mod and the goku mod. Both are awesome and work together despite warnings in the random mod that specific character mods may cause issues. Random survivors pretty much takes care of the content ever becoming stale since it creates a random set every time the game is launched. The goku mod is still worth checking out though because it is so well made - the model, the voice lines, the additional systems (transformations, energy meter, power level, etc). 

It's the most fun dbz gaming experience I've had and it's just a mod for another game.
                you just awakened my dbz flame again bro. Its been a while since playing some DBFZ or some budokai lol im definitely doing it tonight
                    Just be sure to adjust his loadout. I prefer meteor crash to ki blast and charge to instant transmission. Using charge to scream raise your energy is the most DBZ thing ever. I believe the transformations go all the way up to kaioken x20 and super saiyan blue, both active at the same time lol.

Just read up carefully on the mechanics so you use 'em all and it's like.. damn, why can't regular dbz games be this good?
I have not tried any of those, but now I gotta O\_o
    Goku has voicelines and additional mechanics. He's got a power level which lets you transform into various super saiyan and kaioken forms. He's also got loadouts so you can choose between things like kamehameha or spirit bomb. Oh and he can fly :P It's probably the best *dbz*  gameplay I've experienced and it's just a ROR mod lol
        Is it a steam community mod or nexxus or what?

&#x200B;

:o
            I edited it into my original reply. The risk of rain community seems to have their own website which is neither the steam workshop nor the usual nexus mod site. They've got  [https://thunderstore.io/](https://thunderstore.io/) and you're looking for something called RoR2ModManager by scottbot95. 

I grew up with mods and it's been rough since MW2 where modding more or less officially died for AAA games so more DLC can be sold / games die faster so more sequels can be made. Or undying shit like GTA V.
                Oh I love modding, and I don't mind mod managers at all. I'd just never known about any that existed for RoR. I'm exiteeeed :D
                    It's the perfect game for them :) there's an api mod for RoR as well if you decide to try and make one. That goku one is very inspiring.
... But they can make it VR. Oooooh.
    Now there's an idea!
Damn what!? That's a deal! Fuckin gamers man.. the best people ever. I absolutely promise I will play it.. given this super effective recommendation.

UPDATE: played all last night. it's phenomenal. I'll be paying this forward on u/Nytohan 's new sub r/PayItForwardGaming . Hey u/SrGrafo is there anyone in this thread that you think deserves to be surprised w/ a steam code?
    [removed]
        UPDATE: registered and installed!! Can not wait to play this after work. You, my friend, earned more than just internet karma today. Thank you!
            Sounds like someone just made a friend. That's heartwarming... I'm leaving the internet for today so it can't destroy the faith in humanity I just gained.
                Hey, you go have an excellent day.
            [deleted]
                Ah shit you find me on steam? Wait is there online multiplayer or am I wooshing right now? (Steam username is same)
        Just letting you know, you sold a copy based on this as well.  If you like it enough to give it to an internet stranger, then that's a good enough recommend for me, and I bought it immediately.
            Oh god, that's more pressure than I was expecting.

I hope you like the game!
                G'wan  git, ya heartwarmin' fucks.
                    The influence is strong today. This is good influence though, not social media influence. Wait, this is a form of social media. Shit.
                        Sr Grafo is an influencer!
                If it makes you feel better, I read this series of comments and immediately went and bought it then immediately returned it, stating "Nytohan can't be trusted" as my reason.
                    I mean... that's not UNTRUE.
                i own the game as well and just wanted to put my 2 cents in that i love it as well. have fun guys!
                Honestly that went double for me. I get off work in 12 hours and I'm gonna be picking it up too. Let's do this shit.
        The gaming community is great sometimes
            Yeah that’s a huge sometimes.
        You know what, because you're a cool dude I'll buy the game as soon as I can.

People like you are why I love the gaming community.
        What a legend. God, The Last Of Us subreddit could use a dose of this kindness right now.
            Last of us subreddit is a reflection of the game, people tearing eachothers appart
    Fuckin *gamers* man. Fun fact, I got Fallout: NV in a similar way to this.
        Is New Vegas any good?
            Fantastic. The base game can go as low as $3 during sales and I’ve never had more fun patrolling the Mojave
            I think I’ve put close to 1000 hours into the game across 3 consoles and multiple play throughs, it’s my favorite fallout game
            Yeah. It's great. Not without bugs... but just great. I am actually replaying it now.
        I had someone gift me Oxygen Not Included in a similar way, too
    Would be fun if you liked it, and only if you really liked it, to also gift a key to semeone else, and if that person also likes it to gift it to another person, etc, etc
        Hey, I like this idea. A lot. Just set up a subreddit, /r/PayItForwardGaming.  
Need to set up how it works and all, but maybe this can be a thing.
🏅 here’s a poor mans gold
    It's so much more meaningful because you made it yourself.
I didn't expect to come across something so wholesome while reading Reddit, but here we are.
    "Be excellent to each other." -  *Bill S*. *Preston*, *Esq*.
Risk of Rain was hard until you got the modifier that lets you pick what upgrade you want everytime you pick one up.  Once you know which upgrade is which and how effective they are, it's a relative cakewalk depending on what character you pick.  Some of them feel completely helpless solo.  Hit speed, leech on hit and leech on kill, overall HP increases... stuff like that turns you into a tank in no time and from there you pick stuff that ups damage either directly or indirectly.  Chef with that stuff is practically invincible from the crazy amounts of leech on hit.  I love watching like 30 homing rockets shoot out into the sky and rain down on enemies every time I open a chest.
I haven't played either one, which should I play first?
    Honestly, Risk of Rain didn't grab me like RoR 2, but go check out some videos. We all have our own preferences!
    There isn't really an important continuity to it. There IS a bit of story behind it all in the Dark Souls way. But like Dark Souls, playing them in any order won't really change your experience of it.  


It really comes down to which you enjoy more, 2D or 3D. Some people find one or the other much harder to grapple with.
    If you like 2D platformers, the original is good fun. If you're more into 3D shooters, then RoR2 is fantastic.
Take this platinum and get out of here you beautiful bastard you.
    Why anyone would spend money on an internet stranger is beyond me, but thank you! :)
Codes or it didn't happen...
    I mean, I can give you the now used steam code...
I tried 1 first and I just couldn't get the hang of controlling a character the size of like 4 pixels, I could barely last 5 minutes.  I was able to play for over 90 minutes first run on 2.
God I'm the exact opposite. So many years of playing RoR1, RoR2 feels stupid easy in comparison. I'm good at shooters though so that might be it.
    Yeah I suck at shooters.
        You should play the huntress then. She's really good for people who aren't great at 3d shooting.
    It's so much harder to dodge in RoR2 though. In 1 you just need to jump, in 2 the enemies have aimbots that are always targeting you so you need to either kill them or get behind something to avoid them.
        It's really mostly lesser wisps, to be honest. No other enemy in the game has a body count near as high, I'm sure of it.
            I found that its just because the game is balanced to prevent god runs more. They still happen but you're more likely to die before you can get a build that is truly unkilleable.
            Even when you’re not running Shaped Glass, the bastards will kill you. Especially Blazing ones.
        The trick is positioning, movement, and prioritizing wisps until you have will'o'wisps or some ukuleles. You should always be moving to place the enemy at your maximum engagement range and minimizing how surrounded you are, merc has iframes to deal and loader should be moving in and out quickly. Fighting under a hoard of wisps is a great way to eat shit. These days I mostly play with Artifact of Glass, so I might be biased, but it's always better to move to a more advantageous spot than brawl it out.
Shit I'm out then. Same thing happened to me and Hotline Miami 2. If I can't actually finish a game it just haunts me.
    Be like me and just play with command, and try and do wacky things. I have never looped a monsoon without it, but ill keep trying. Until then ill keep messing around and having fun with command.
    Well there is no beating Risk of Rain 2, it just keeps getting harder til you lose. (There are difficulty settings for how fast it ramps up).
        There is technically ways to "win". Gotta get through the blue portal.
            Celestial portal, I think blue goes to the friendly lizard wizard
    I got 99.9% completion on Spyro when I was a kid, all I had left was one dragon and a few gems in the Treetops level which I kept struggling to reach. One day my memory card was full and I accidentally deleted the save freeing up space for another game.

More recently I picked up Spyro: Reignited but I still never managed to get to that platform on Treetops, and I don't play PS4 much these days anyway.
    Argh man that army camp level still gives me nightmares. Stick with it though you'll do it.
Nah but my buddy has it in our family share dealio.. what's up with it?
    I've never beat it. I've beat every rouge lite I play, but not nuclear throne.
Yes! Chris is an amazing artist. The music in 2 SLAPS my guy. It is just as top tier as 1, with some motifs and nods to it as well. I played deadbolt just to hear his music! He’s truly wonderful.
Ror2 is literally ror1 but in a 3d world. If you enjoy ror1 I highly recommend ror2. Just keep in mind it's moderately early Access, so it's not perfectly fleshed out. There are also changes to certain items and stuff.

Oh god what did I start here.
    The next update will be the end of early access. I think it's dropping soon.

*Spelling
        Bought it day one, played a few hours and decided to wait until it is out of early access.  Still was tons of fun tho.
            Its a ton of fun, but it takes forever to unlock characters. Its also not clear how to unlock them all.
                Well I mean they are hidden on purpose.
                i would say you're good to go ahead and look up how to unlock them - the first few characters i unlocked just by playing the game in my first 7 or so runs i reckon.  


once you get into it, you'd have to actively avoid working out/finding out how to unlock the characters.  


the artifacts however... wow there's a bit of a puzzle and also a lot of work.
                Exactly like RoR1. Great series.
                Google makes it very clear. And if it still too difficult I recommend using mods once to unlock new characters. I agree they need to do better with explaining how to unlock them though.
                [deleted]
                    Thats a great idea!
                I find it super difficult!!
                I just edited my save to unlock all the characters. I told my friends to do the same. The game's more fun when you find a character you like. That first one (? I don't remember) and Huntress are fine and all but imo, are among the most boring characters. They might be your only characters after 5 hours of play too if you're doing things blind.
                It is **pretty** clear. I've owned it for write some time. Maybe you didn't look in the logs?
            I've been playing on/off since day one and I must say, go ahead and pick it back up, it's loads and loads of fun. And you'll definitely see the love that's gone in to it. Especially if you played 1 :)
            yeah, I loved 1 and bought 2 just to re-reward the developers. I fully expected the move to 3D to ruin it.

Played a few hours at the beginning of Early Access and was really surprised at how well the mechanics translated. Then I put it down because it's worth waiting for fewer bugs and more features.

Basically, it's the poster child for how Early Access should work.
        August
        August is 1.0.
        What's the status on difficulty?  I played a ton when it first dropped and had a great time, then the update dropped that retooled difficulty and it was suddenly absolutely crushingly hard.  Like an order of magnitude more difficult, even at the normal difficulty.

Have they balanced that out at all?  My friends and I were getting absolutely demolished, to the point where it was a lot less fun compared to when it first launched.
        August is the 1.0 release, I'm really excited
        Sounds like a possibility of a sale! Hopefully there's a sale on switch too

Very different. It's also pretty fun from the time I've had playing it. If you prefer a third person shooter then it's your game. Wisps are also deadlier somehow...
    It's different... While being the exact same game somehow
        Yes, which is why it's one of my highly recommended games as well. The only game I know of with a better 2D->3D jump was GTA.
Nah, my biggest gripe with ROR2 is that it's literally just ROR1 but 3d which, IMO, hurts the experience. I enjoyed 1 a far deal greater because it's very difficult to wrap your head around enemies coming at you from 360°.

But that's just preferences on my part. It's still a very good game.

My only complaint is that it absolutely devours time.
    Me: I'll just do a quick run on easy and screw around. 

137 minutes into the run: fuk.
    i just wish there was a functionality to save mid run and continue at another time
        There are so many mods, check it out, saves you at the start of each stage.

    I did an endless run in RoR1 that lasted about 20 hours. I put on the cheat to pick my drops and wanted to see just how OP I could get. Turns out you can be pretty much invincible.
9PM: I'll just play a quick game of RoR2 before bed

2:35AM: fuck
Oh hey, amusing to run across this as I am listening to a [remix of Tor's theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CBOU-42eJE)
    I must assume you're a pretty rad person.
Yeah part of why I decided to wait awhile was so that I could play through a ton of new content, instead of just playing through new content as it came out and potentially getting bored.

I wanted it to feel more like the original when I played that, where there was already most of the game in place.
    If you want a huge change, somebody upthread said that they are working on the "out of early access" patch, so it might be worth checking their blog or whatever -- if you've already waited a year, a month or so might not be a big wait (I know nothing about their timeline, it is just a thought). 

OTOH they did add many of the classic artifacts from 1, so there's definitely enough new stuff to play through.
The worst thing with the game is that if you don't die, your PC will eventually.
    Yup, crashed game at 4:30:00 in and 4:35:00 so its a fine line apparently lol
Looks like people in the know corrected that one quick.
Who else do you want to have it? The artificer?
I always forget I have one of those. Whenever I get revived I instantly die again.
I mean I understand the rogue like mechanics but the idea of unlocking is fairly limited in RoR. Not all higher tier skills are more viable than the base skills and there are a few separate classes to unlock. 

I enjoy the game. 

I like it a lot. 

I think it has really sweet coop for couch playing. 

I just never found their idea of progression to be very interesting or fun.
    Fair enough, haven't really tested it out lately so I haven't really checked out the newest stuff. Had a blast when it came out but even then it was some stuff that was a bit grindy/hard to unlock without external help.
        I just used this website. https://tbfts.github.io/ror2_save_editor/ to edit my save and give me all unlocks.

It's a roguelike so you still need to get lucky to have a good playthrough but with everything unlocked at least you know all items and abilities are available to you during your run.
No rain, just the constant risk that there might be some
    Sounds like the average summer day where I live
        A fellow Brit I see.
            Central Canada actually. Usually we don’t get too much rain but the last month has been really stormy and there has been a risk of rain almost every single day. Sucks too because I’ve been wanting to go in my pool for like a week now but haven’t gotten much of a chance.
                Just go into your pool anyway. After all if it rains you're already wet.
                    Is it weird that I like swimming in the rain more than swimming in bright sunshine? Just something about it.
            It was so weird for me to move to England and find out it actually rains more in my home country!

I feel lied to
    If there's none then there's no risk
to be fair it is called risk of rain not currently raining
    So... Tease of Rain?  Blue Rain Balls?  Rain That's Out Of Your League And You're Never Going To Get It And Both You And The Rain Know It But You Play Anyway?
        That last ones an r/suspiciouslyspecific from me
It's got a whole extra dimension in it.
Wait that's actually true.

The whole game is the anxiety of: "Should I hunt for more items or just activate the tele and get the fuck outta here before The Director screws me over".

Never thought of it like that before.
Actually there can be rain in every level. You just have to play as Huntress.

Huntress has an ability called "Arrow **Rain**".
To be fair, the "rain" was all the ship parts breaking up and landing on the planet. How else would you finding Electric Ukeleles. "And his music was electric."
It's only the penultimate in the series. Expectation of Rain, Risk of Rain, and finally Relentless Rain
I knew it, even before I clicked. And yet I still clicked
Ain't that wacky?
Ah, so how tall are you 2 meters 3 meters
    More like 2. And before you ask I am a South Pole, not a North Pole
Laughs in Ballista.
    that's why it's a risk, it's uncertain.
When I play as Artificer, I'd say there's a risk of meteor showers with the occasional ball lightning from above.
Actually yes. Ballista is the better pick 100% of the time.
Thank you, I'm so glad you mentioned that! I always assumed that's what the title was referencing, but I never saw that from the devs, and nobody else seemed to make the connection, so I thought maybe it was just me!
You just exploded my fucking brain , compadre
Wtf spoilers now there's no point in playing
Played 1 and 2 and always knew this too so +1
I wonder if /u/AngryMeerkat actually exists.

They do but haven't done anything in years.
    And their only post and comment is about ball pits haha
        Well? Does anyone have an answer to his question?
            Must be why s/he quit posting in reddit.
Oh God, I haven't played that in ages lol, but it's definitely along those lines.
    Nothing beats Gauntlet Legends though
        Except, of course, Gauntlet: Dark Legacy
            I found a copy of that for like 2 bucks at a garage sale for the ps2. I had previously owned it on xbox but had long since lost it. I still remembered where every secret was and my SO was getting annoyed because she was completely lost. Still super fun.
        Blue JESTER...is about to die..
            Sometimes when I'm hungry I hear a voice in my head "Red warrior needs food badly."
Well see here’s the thing, 

Raid shadow Legends isn’t a game. It’s an app that slowly tempts small minded people to give them money, for no reason. They barely have to spend a dime on the “game” itself, so they can pump out thousands in advertising.

Risk of Rain 2 is an actual video game with actual stuff to do and actual gameplay. A smaller game developer can’t do that because if they want their game to succeed, they have to do the right things and implement certain things to make it fun. Then people will buy it and then you’ve made your paycheck for the game. (Only considering smaller studios)
    Hopoo games is actually a very small team. The first game, as well as ROR2's early access build and first few updates were made by a 3 person dev team.
        Right, but Raid Shadow Legends isn’t an actual video game though. So they don’t really have much work to do. That’s what I’m getting at. 

RoR2 has a good dev team that brings us a good game. They deserve the price point for purchasing the game. 

Raid Shadow Legends is malware.
            Oh, I'm an idiot and misread your first comment as the opposite of what you were saying. Yeah I totally agree with everything you said. Well put bud
                Haha no problem dude, I figured you meant that! Hopefully what I said didn’t get conveyed as being as asshole, didn’t mean for that! 

Edit: outside of shitting on that trash heap of a “game”.
raid has some of the best graphics out of any mobilee game s well as tons of champions to choose from and over 10 million downloads with some of the beat reviews on the play store. join now with the link in the description and get 500 silver for free. see you there!
I thought the game was OK until I unlocked mercenary, I haven't fallen in love with a character's mechanics like that since Orianna from League of Legends.

My only complaint is I literally can't practice with that dude, my hand starts to cramp after an hour with how fast you need to be.
    I love Mercenary and the super punchy guy, the archer is pretty great too, but I can’t really get into Rex or the robot with two guns.
        Rex is fantastic once you understand that your M2 does all the damage, M1 is minor healing and R is major healing/crowd control. He's amazing once you understand how he works
        MUL-T was really tough for me to get into, but was also the first character I finished a Monsoon run with. Play with the Artifact of Command and pump some Goat Hooves into him, you may enjoy him once he's more mobile.
            I do enjoy becoming speed itself in RoR2 whenever there is a Goat hoof printer or Soda printer.
                With the artifact of command you can just make all the items you get be goat hoofs lol, you become dangerously fast, like falling of the map twenty times
    I’m also an Ori main, rejoice
I've been always looting everything from the start. Got all the characters unlocked and majority of the items. But then again I haven't played on monsoon that much.
    Yeah on monsoon you gotta plan it out a little bit. If you dawdle on the first 3 worlds you get fucked later. 

Later it's a balancing act of progressing through the worlds fast enough so that you don't get overwhelmed while grabbing enough loot to stay strong. 


If you find a good 3D printer or a legendary chest it is ok to stay though. I had a run with like 20 soldiers syringes + dmg items recently and it was amazing.
        I haven't been able to get past the fourth stage on Monsoon yet. I'm probably spending too much time looting in the previous stages. I always end up getting killed by the Elder Lemurians that start showing up at that time.
            Basically just blitz the first 3 rounds. Then you can chill for a bit and loot. I believe in you
    I play exclusively on Monsoon, def want to get through the level quick but not avoid loot completely
I'm not super familiar with the game, why would you skip through the levels like that without getting any upgrades?
    The game gets progressively harder with each minute the passes. In the earliest stages of the game its often better to level quickly as opposed to burning through the time to unlock all the loot boxes.

Monsters spawn so slow initially you'll be waiting around for them to spawn and waste time.

The 5 minutes you save going straight to the boss doesn't seem like a big deal, but a couple levels later when you're hit with a tougher enemies that are spawning faster and you might want those 5 minutes back.
Holy shit! This dude isn't a native English speaker?!
I'm pretty sure he actually just did that on accident.
i found artifact of command to utterly ruin the gameplay experience.  Customizing your build made the game much easier, but also took away the fun offered by the randomness of drops.  Also the interface was super clunky for such a fast paced game.
    Command saps the fun for me. I want to risk wax quails raining down on me.
Oh no they updated with the Artifacts? Welp guess I gotta put more time in.
Once you get command, build Will-o'-the-wisp (green) and pick up at least one ceremonial dagger (red). Then use white to build whatever is good for your character. I usually do 10 crit glasses, some teddy bears, other healing items, movement speed, and crowbars. At this point with a ton of wisps, you'll kill one mob and itll explode and kill everything around it. Anything that spawns soon after gets killed by the daggers from the last group. I usually pair Command with Soul, and Swarms as that will increase enemy spawn (more density for explosions). 


But like the other commenter said, command kinda takes away a lot of the fun because now I dont get to try other RNG builds.
    My friends have a pact of never getting ceremonial dagger because of how overpowered it is. Also, on command you don't need 10 crit glasses, items that give you crit bonuses like harvester scythe and predatory instinct give you a small amount of crit, 7-8 is plenty. Teddy bears and wax quails are an absolute must on monsoon with artifact of glass, unless you are playing engineer (in which case, dat sweet fungus), with command on, the only healing item that is really worth it is harvester scythes. There are a number of viable late game builds for monsoon but the easiest are status/death mark, sentient meat hook, missiles and willothewisps, and crit/crowbar/missiles. If you're doing all artefact monsoon runs, or the void fields, teddies are super important, as are armor plates, which also help with when you have to fight 4+ magma/overloading worms amd everything is awful. There are other builds of course, stacking razorwire on Rex is great, you basically just destroy everything in a huge radius. 

All artefact runs really make command much more balanced, but its not for the faint of heart (we usually turn artefact of death off because it is unfun in multi-player, it is hard enough already, and it becomes increasingly easier to accidentally teamkill). But watch out for the explosions. So many explosions. And those ice elites are really killer.
I have a buddy who does that sometimes. We always yell at him. Conversation goes something like this:

Friend 1 (Engineer): Why did you just pick up your 4th fungus? I don't have any yet.

Friend 2/Jerk (Acrid): Bruh, fungus are good for everyone.

(Next time we play)

Me (Rex): Dude, why do you keep picking up all the teddy bears? It's literally the only thing that keeps me from killing myself.

Friend/Jerk (Acrid): Everybody needs teddies.
    Taking my bungus as Engineer is grounds for getting unfriended on Steam.
        That's particularly egregious because if the Engineer has them it helps everyone.
            Good thing we don't have to worry about it since the game decides not to spawn any bungus when there's an engi on the team.
                aint that the truth.
Hot?
    Possibly r/SuddenlyGay
        Ain't nothing wrong with that.
            I never said it was wrong tho?
Show us where he touched you
    It’s okay I kinda liked it
"You mean the latest masterpiece of fantasy storytelling from Lucasfilm's™ Brian Moriarty?"
Awesome! Well I know what I am going to play tonight.
Thank you!
There is a story!! You just have to piece it together from the encyclopedia magigers.
    Ok but is there a traditional plot this man can't follow without playing the first one or is that a bonus side lore thing?
Thank you!
Hey another one like me! If you like pixel horror check out "The Count Lucanor" by Baroque Decay. They also made a sequel which I'm playing through right now called "Yuppie Psycho".

EDIT: Not a sequel! Just another game, sorry.
Funny you mention "stumbling" across stuff. I first found Minecraft on the website StumbleUpon back when that was a big(ger) thing, thought it would be a neat toy and bought it early. Man has that been a *great* investment.
More of asphyxiation
    But then how do you eat a cookie after anti-breathing?

Yeah and they're working tirelessly, judging from all the little updates.

Oh I know, lol.
    Hahaha well good on you then :D
Leave. I did ages ago, happened by here with a crosspost.
Or JrGrafo.
    Isnt SrGrafo short for Señor Grafo, or is it senior
        I always read it in my head as “sir grafo”
            Am I the only one who read it as Sargeant Graph I?
                Yes
        I'm not sure tbh. I was just making a silly joke. We would have to ask the man himself for clarification.
            Calling user u/srgrafo for clarification
        I always thought dude was a Brit and its "Sir Grafo"
        Psure its sir
        Makes me think of Señor Senior Sr from Kim Possible
        He's portuguese, so it's "senhor grafo". Here we abreviate it like this, senhor (portuguese for mister) to sr, like you do it from mister to mr.
    SrGrafoJr

There's somewhere in the config you can set a seed so you can generate the same heroes every time if you want to play multiplayer with them, otherwise it's random every time the game starts up. It's pretty cool and some are broken bad or broken good. The one I tried there was probably the most powerful one, but some what balanced by being big and slow. 

The replay value in that mod is hard to put to words :)
    Is there a name for the mod that I can look for?
er, no - I'll edit the mod site into my first reply because it's neither steam nor the usual nexus. It's  [https://thunderstore.io/](https://thunderstore.io/)  and the mod manager from there handles it all :)
    Oh awesome I’m gonna have to do that! Saw a video and it looks super easy
        I'm using the random survivors mod and the goku mod. Both are awesome and work together despite warnings in the random mod that specific character mods may cause issues. Random survivors pretty much takes care of the content ever becoming stale since it creates a random set every time the game is launched. The goku mod is still worth checking out though because it is so well made - the model, the voice lines, the additional systems (transformations, energy meter, power level, etc). 

It's the most fun dbz gaming experience I've had and it's just a mod for another game.
            you just awakened my dbz flame again bro. Its been a while since playing some DBFZ or some budokai lol im definitely doing it tonight
                Just be sure to adjust his loadout. I prefer meteor crash to ki blast and charge to instant transmission. Using charge to scream raise your energy is the most DBZ thing ever. I believe the transformations go all the way up to kaioken x20 and super saiyan blue, both active at the same time lol.

Just read up carefully on the mechanics so you use 'em all and it's like.. damn, why can't regular dbz games be this good?
Goku has voicelines and additional mechanics. He's got a power level which lets you transform into various super saiyan and kaioken forms. He's also got loadouts so you can choose between things like kamehameha or spirit bomb. Oh and he can fly :P It's probably the best *dbz*  gameplay I've experienced and it's just a ROR mod lol
    Is it a steam community mod or nexxus or what?

&#x200B;

:o
        I edited it into my original reply. The risk of rain community seems to have their own website which is neither the steam workshop nor the usual nexus mod site. They've got  [https://thunderstore.io/](https://thunderstore.io/) and you're looking for something called RoR2ModManager by scottbot95. 

I grew up with mods and it's been rough since MW2 where modding more or less officially died for AAA games so more DLC can be sold / games die faster so more sequels can be made. Or undying shit like GTA V.
            Oh I love modding, and I don't mind mod managers at all. I'd just never known about any that existed for RoR. I'm exiteeeed :D
                It's the perfect game for them :) there's an api mod for RoR as well if you decide to try and make one. That goku one is very inspiring.
Now there's an idea!

    UPDATE: registered and installed!! Can not wait to play this after work. You, my friend, earned more than just internet karma today. Thank you!
        Sounds like someone just made a friend. That's heartwarming... I'm leaving the internet for today so it can't destroy the faith in humanity I just gained.
            Hey, you go have an excellent day.
        [deleted]
            Ah shit you find me on steam? Wait is there online multiplayer or am I wooshing right now? (Steam username is same)
    Just letting you know, you sold a copy based on this as well.  If you like it enough to give it to an internet stranger, then that's a good enough recommend for me, and I bought it immediately.
        Oh god, that's more pressure than I was expecting.

I hope you like the game!
            G'wan  git, ya heartwarmin' fucks.
                The influence is strong today. This is good influence though, not social media influence. Wait, this is a form of social media. Shit.
                    Sr Grafo is an influencer!
            If it makes you feel better, I read this series of comments and immediately went and bought it then immediately returned it, stating "Nytohan can't be trusted" as my reason.
                I mean... that's not UNTRUE.
            i own the game as well and just wanted to put my 2 cents in that i love it as well. have fun guys!
            Honestly that went double for me. I get off work in 12 hours and I'm gonna be picking it up too. Let's do this shit.
    The gaming community is great sometimes
        Yeah that’s a huge sometimes.
    You know what, because you're a cool dude I'll buy the game as soon as I can.

People like you are why I love the gaming community.
    What a legend. God, The Last Of Us subreddit could use a dose of this kindness right now.
        Last of us subreddit is a reflection of the game, people tearing eachothers appart
Fuckin *gamers* man. Fun fact, I got Fallout: NV in a similar way to this.
    Is New Vegas any good?
        Fantastic. The base game can go as low as $3 during sales and I’ve never had more fun patrolling the Mojave
        I think I’ve put close to 1000 hours into the game across 3 consoles and multiple play throughs, it’s my favorite fallout game
        Yeah. It's great. Not without bugs... but just great. I am actually replaying it now.
    I had someone gift me Oxygen Not Included in a similar way, too
Would be fun if you liked it, and only if you really liked it, to also gift a key to semeone else, and if that person also likes it to gift it to another person, etc, etc
    Hey, I like this idea. A lot. Just set up a subreddit, /r/PayItForwardGaming.  
Need to set up how it works and all, but maybe this can be a thing.
It's so much more meaningful because you made it yourself.
"Be excellent to each other." -  *Bill S*. *Preston*, *Esq*.
Honestly, Risk of Rain didn't grab me like RoR 2, but go check out some videos. We all have our own preferences!
There isn't really an important continuity to it. There IS a bit of story behind it all in the Dark Souls way. But like Dark Souls, playing them in any order won't really change your experience of it.  


It really comes down to which you enjoy more, 2D or 3D. Some people find one or the other much harder to grapple with.
If you like 2D platformers, the original is good fun. If you're more into 3D shooters, then RoR2 is fantastic.
Why anyone would spend money on an internet stranger is beyond me, but thank you! :)
I mean, I can give you the now used steam code...
Yeah I suck at shooters.
    You should play the huntress then. She's really good for people who aren't great at 3d shooting.
It's so much harder to dodge in RoR2 though. In 1 you just need to jump, in 2 the enemies have aimbots that are always targeting you so you need to either kill them or get behind something to avoid them.
    It's really mostly lesser wisps, to be honest. No other enemy in the game has a body count near as high, I'm sure of it.
        I found that its just because the game is balanced to prevent god runs more. They still happen but you're more likely to die before you can get a build that is truly unkilleable.
        Even when you’re not running Shaped Glass, the bastards will kill you. Especially Blazing ones.
    The trick is positioning, movement, and prioritizing wisps until you have will'o'wisps or some ukuleles. You should always be moving to place the enemy at your maximum engagement range and minimizing how surrounded you are, merc has iframes to deal and loader should be moving in and out quickly. Fighting under a hoard of wisps is a great way to eat shit. These days I mostly play with Artifact of Glass, so I might be biased, but it's always better to move to a more advantageous spot than brawl it out.
Be like me and just play with command, and try and do wacky things. I have never looped a monsoon without it, but ill keep trying. Until then ill keep messing around and having fun with command.
Well there is no beating Risk of Rain 2, it just keeps getting harder til you lose. (There are difficulty settings for how fast it ramps up).
    There is technically ways to "win". Gotta get through the blue portal.
        Celestial portal, I think blue goes to the friendly lizard wizard
I got 99.9% completion on Spyro when I was a kid, all I had left was one dragon and a few gems in the Treetops level which I kept struggling to reach. One day my memory card was full and I accidentally deleted the save freeing up space for another game.

More recently I picked up Spyro: Reignited but I still never managed to get to that platform on Treetops, and I don't play PS4 much these days anyway.
Argh man that army camp level still gives me nightmares. Stick with it though you'll do it.
I've never beat it. I've beat every rouge lite I play, but not nuclear throne.
The next update will be the end of early access. I think it's dropping soon.

*Spelling
    Bought it day one, played a few hours and decided to wait until it is out of early access.  Still was tons of fun tho.
        Its a ton of fun, but it takes forever to unlock characters. Its also not clear how to unlock them all.
            Well I mean they are hidden on purpose.
            i would say you're good to go ahead and look up how to unlock them - the first few characters i unlocked just by playing the game in my first 7 or so runs i reckon.  


once you get into it, you'd have to actively avoid working out/finding out how to unlock the characters.  


the artifacts however... wow there's a bit of a puzzle and also a lot of work.
            Exactly like RoR1. Great series.
            Google makes it very clear. And if it still too difficult I recommend using mods once to unlock new characters. I agree they need to do better with explaining how to unlock them though.
            [deleted]
                Thats a great idea!
            I find it super difficult!!
            I just edited my save to unlock all the characters. I told my friends to do the same. The game's more fun when you find a character you like. That first one (? I don't remember) and Huntress are fine and all but imo, are among the most boring characters. They might be your only characters after 5 hours of play too if you're doing things blind.
            It is **pretty** clear. I've owned it for write some time. Maybe you didn't look in the logs?
        I've been playing on/off since day one and I must say, go ahead and pick it back up, it's loads and loads of fun. And you'll definitely see the love that's gone in to it. Especially if you played 1 :)
        yeah, I loved 1 and bought 2 just to re-reward the developers. I fully expected the move to 3D to ruin it.

Played a few hours at the beginning of Early Access and was really surprised at how well the mechanics translated. Then I put it down because it's worth waiting for fewer bugs and more features.

Basically, it's the poster child for how Early Access should work.
    August
    August is 1.0.
    What's the status on difficulty?  I played a ton when it first dropped and had a great time, then the update dropped that retooled difficulty and it was suddenly absolutely crushingly hard.  Like an order of magnitude more difficult, even at the normal difficulty.

Have they balanced that out at all?  My friends and I were getting absolutely demolished, to the point where it was a lot less fun compared to when it first launched.
    August is the 1.0 release, I'm really excited
    Sounds like a possibility of a sale! Hopefully there's a sale on switch too

    Yes, which is why it's one of my highly recommended games as well. The only game I know of with a better 2D->3D jump was GTA.

Not a very subtle reference to Purple Rain by Prince, I love it

Me: I'll just do a quick run on easy and screw around. 

137 minutes into the run: fuk.
i just wish there was a functionality to save mid run and continue at another time
    There are so many mods, check it out, saves you at the start of each stage.

https://thunderstore.io/package/KingEnderBrine/ProperSave/
I did an endless run in RoR1 that lasted about 20 hours. I put on the cheat to pick my drops and wanted to see just how OP I could get. Turns out you can be pretty much invincible.
I must assume you're a pretty rad person.
If you want a huge change, somebody upthread said that they are working on the "out of early access" patch, so it might be worth checking their blog or whatever -- if you've already waited a year, a month or so might not be a big wait (I know nothing about their timeline, it is just a thought). 

OTOH they did add many of the classic artifacts from 1, so there's definitely enough new stuff to play through.
Yup, crashed game at 4:30:00 in and 4:35:00 so its a fine line apparently lol
Fair enough, haven't really tested it out lately so I haven't really checked out the newest stuff. Had a blast when it came out but even then it was some stuff that was a bit grindy/hard to unlock without external help.
    I just used this website. https://tbfts.github.io/ror2_save_editor/ to edit my save and give me all unlocks.

It's a roguelike so you still need to get lucky to have a good playthrough but with everything unlocked at least you know all items and abilities are available to you during your run.
Sounds like the average summer day where I live
    A fellow Brit I see.
        Central Canada actually. Usually we don’t get too much rain but the last month has been really stormy and there has been a risk of rain almost every single day. Sucks too because I’ve been wanting to go in my pool for like a week now but haven’t gotten much of a chance.
            Just go into your pool anyway. After all if it rains you're already wet.
                Is it weird that I like swimming in the rain more than swimming in bright sunshine? Just something about it.
        It was so weird for me to move to England and find out it actually rains more in my home country!

I feel lied to
If there's none then there's no risk
So... Tease of Rain?  Blue Rain Balls?  Rain That's Out Of Your League And You're Never Going To Get It And Both You And The Rain Know It But You Play Anyway?

Nothing beats Gauntlet Legends though
    Except, of course, Gauntlet: Dark Legacy
        I found a copy of that for like 2 bucks at a garage sale for the ps2. I had previously owned it on xbox but had long since lost it. I still remembered where every secret was and my SO was getting annoyed because she was completely lost. Still super fun.
    Blue JESTER...is about to die..
        Sometimes when I'm hungry I hear a voice in my head "Red warrior needs food badly."
Hopoo games is actually a very small team. The first game, as well as ROR2's early access build and first few updates were made by a 3 person dev team.
    Right, but Raid Shadow Legends isn’t an actual video game though. So they don’t really have much work to do. That’s what I’m getting at. 

RoR2 has a good dev team that brings us a good game. They deserve the price point for purchasing the game. 

Raid Shadow Legends is malware.
        Oh, I'm an idiot and misread your first comment as the opposite of what you were saying. Yeah I totally agree with everything you said. Well put bud
            Haha no problem dude, I figured you meant that! Hopefully what I said didn’t get conveyed as being as asshole, didn’t mean for that! 

Edit: outside of shitting on that trash heap of a “game”.
I love Mercenary and the super punchy guy, the archer is pretty great too, but I can’t really get into Rex or the robot with two guns.
    Rex is fantastic once you understand that your M2 does all the damage, M1 is minor healing and R is major healing/crowd control. He's amazing once you understand how he works
    MUL-T was really tough for me to get into, but was also the first character I finished a Monsoon run with. Play with the Artifact of Command and pump some Goat Hooves into him, you may enjoy him once he's more mobile.
        I do enjoy becoming speed itself in RoR2 whenever there is a Goat hoof printer or Soda printer.
            With the artifact of command you can just make all the items you get be goat hoofs lol, you become dangerously fast, like falling of the map twenty times
I’m also an Ori main, rejoice
Yeah on monsoon you gotta plan it out a little bit. If you dawdle on the first 3 worlds you get fucked later. 

Later it's a balancing act of progressing through the worlds fast enough so that you don't get overwhelmed while grabbing enough loot to stay strong. 


If you find a good 3D printer or a legendary chest it is ok to stay though. I had a run with like 20 soldiers syringes + dmg items recently and it was amazing.
    I haven't been able to get past the fourth stage on Monsoon yet. I'm probably spending too much time looting in the previous stages. I always end up getting killed by the Elder Lemurians that start showing up at that time.
        Basically just blitz the first 3 rounds. Then you can chill for a bit and loot. I believe in you
I play exclusively on Monsoon, def want to get through the level quick but not avoid loot completely
The game gets progressively harder with each minute the passes. In the earliest stages of the game its often better to level quickly as opposed to burning through the time to unlock all the loot boxes.

Monsters spawn so slow initially you'll be waiting around for them to spawn and waste time.

The 5 minutes you save going straight to the boss doesn't seem like a big deal, but a couple levels later when you're hit with a tougher enemies that are spawning faster and you might want those 5 minutes back.
Command saps the fun for me. I want to risk wax quails raining down on me.
My friends have a pact of never getting ceremonial dagger because of how overpowered it is. Also, on command you don't need 10 crit glasses, items that give you crit bonuses like harvester scythe and predatory instinct give you a small amount of crit, 7-8 is plenty. Teddy bears and wax quails are an absolute must on monsoon with artifact of glass, unless you are playing engineer (in which case, dat sweet fungus), with command on, the only healing item that is really worth it is harvester scythes. There are a number of viable late game builds for monsoon but the easiest are status/death mark, sentient meat hook, missiles and willothewisps, and crit/crowbar/missiles. If you're doing all artefact monsoon runs, or the void fields, teddies are super important, as are armor plates, which also help with when you have to fight 4+ magma/overloading worms amd everything is awful. There are other builds of course, stacking razorwire on Rex is great, you basically just destroy everything in a huge radius. 

All artefact runs really make command much more balanced, but its not for the faint of heart (we usually turn artefact of death off because it is unfun in multi-player, it is hard enough already, and it becomes increasingly easier to accidentally teamkill). But watch out for the explosions. So many explosions. And those ice elites are really killer.
Taking my bungus as Engineer is grounds for getting unfriended on Steam.
    That's particularly egregious because if the Engineer has them it helps everyone.
        Good thing we don't have to worry about it since the game decides not to spawn any bungus when there's an engi on the team.
            aint that the truth.
Possibly r/SuddenlyGay
    Ain't nothing wrong with that.
        I never said it was wrong tho?
It’s okay I kinda liked it
Ok but is there a traditional plot this man can't follow without playing the first one or is that a bonus side lore thing?
But then how do you eat a cookie after anti-breathing?
    Idk choke it down?
Hahaha well good on you then :D
Isnt SrGrafo short for Señor Grafo, or is it senior
    I always read it in my head as “sir grafo”
        Am I the only one who read it as Sargeant Graph I?
            Yes
    I'm not sure tbh. I was just making a silly joke. We would have to ask the man himself for clarification.
        Calling user u/srgrafo for clarification
    I always thought dude was a Brit and its "Sir Grafo"
    Psure its sir
    Makes me think of Señor Senior Sr from Kim Possible
    He's portuguese, so it's "senhor grafo". Here we abreviate it like this, senhor (portuguese for mister) to sr, like you do it from mister to mr.
SrGrafoJr
Is there a name for the mod that I can look for?
Oh awesome I’m gonna have to do that! Saw a video and it looks super easy
    I'm using the random survivors mod and the goku mod. Both are awesome and work together despite warnings in the random mod that specific character mods may cause issues. Random survivors pretty much takes care of the content ever becoming stale since it creates a random set every time the game is launched. The goku mod is still worth checking out though because it is so well made - the model, the voice lines, the additional systems (transformations, energy meter, power level, etc). 

It's the most fun dbz gaming experience I've had and it's just a mod for another game.
        you just awakened my dbz flame again bro. Its been a while since playing some DBFZ or some budokai lol im definitely doing it tonight
            Just be sure to adjust his loadout. I prefer meteor crash to ki blast and charge to instant transmission. Using charge to scream raise your energy is the most DBZ thing ever. I believe the transformations go all the way up to kaioken x20 and super saiyan blue, both active at the same time lol.

Just read up carefully on the mechanics so you use 'em all and it's like.. damn, why can't regular dbz games be this good?
Is it a steam community mod or nexxus or what?

&#x200B;

:o
    I edited it into my original reply. The risk of rain community seems to have their own website which is neither the steam workshop nor the usual nexus mod site. They've got  [https://thunderstore.io/](https://thunderstore.io/) and you're looking for something called RoR2ModManager by scottbot95. 

I grew up with mods and it's been rough since MW2 where modding more or less officially died for AAA games so more DLC can be sold / games die faster so more sequels can be made. Or undying shit like GTA V.
        Oh I love modding, and I don't mind mod managers at all. I'd just never known about any that existed for RoR. I'm exiteeeed :D
            It's the perfect game for them :) there's an api mod for RoR as well if you decide to try and make one. That goku one is very inspiring.
UPDATE: registered and installed!! Can not wait to play this after work. You, my friend, earned more than just internet karma today. Thank you!
    Sounds like someone just made a friend. That's heartwarming... I'm leaving the internet for today so it can't destroy the faith in humanity I just gained.
        Hey, you go have an excellent day.
    [deleted]
        Ah shit you find me on steam? Wait is there online multiplayer or am I wooshing right now? (Steam username is same)
Just letting you know, you sold a copy based on this as well.  If you like it enough to give it to an internet stranger, then that's a good enough recommend for me, and I bought it immediately.
    Oh god, that's more pressure than I was expecting.

I hope you like the game!
        G'wan  git, ya heartwarmin' fucks.
            The influence is strong today. This is good influence though, not social media influence. Wait, this is a form of social media. Shit.
                Sr Grafo is an influencer!
        If it makes you feel better, I read this series of comments and immediately went and bought it then immediately returned it, stating "Nytohan can't be trusted" as my reason.
            I mean... that's not UNTRUE.
        i own the game as well and just wanted to put my 2 cents in that i love it as well. have fun guys!
        Honestly that went double for me. I get off work in 12 hours and I'm gonna be picking it up too. Let's do this shit.
The gaming community is great sometimes
    Yeah that’s a huge sometimes.
You know what, because you're a cool dude I'll buy the game as soon as I can.

People like you are why I love the gaming community.
What a legend. God, The Last Of Us subreddit could use a dose of this kindness right now.
    Last of us subreddit is a reflection of the game, people tearing eachothers appart
Is New Vegas any good?
    Fantastic. The base game can go as low as $3 during sales and I’ve never had more fun patrolling the Mojave
    I think I’ve put close to 1000 hours into the game across 3 consoles and multiple play throughs, it’s my favorite fallout game
    Yeah. It's great. Not without bugs... but just great. I am actually replaying it now.
I had someone gift me Oxygen Not Included in a similar way, too
Hey, I like this idea. A lot. Just set up a subreddit, /r/PayItForwardGaming.  
Need to set up how it works and all, but maybe this can be a thing.
You should play the huntress then. She's really good for people who aren't great at 3d shooting.
It's really mostly lesser wisps, to be honest. No other enemy in the game has a body count near as high, I'm sure of it.
    I found that its just because the game is balanced to prevent god runs more. They still happen but you're more likely to die before you can get a build that is truly unkilleable.
    Even when you’re not running Shaped Glass, the bastards will kill you. Especially Blazing ones.
The trick is positioning, movement, and prioritizing wisps until you have will'o'wisps or some ukuleles. You should always be moving to place the enemy at your maximum engagement range and minimizing how surrounded you are, merc has iframes to deal and loader should be moving in and out quickly. Fighting under a hoard of wisps is a great way to eat shit. These days I mostly play with Artifact of Glass, so I might be biased, but it's always better to move to a more advantageous spot than brawl it out.
There is technically ways to "win". Gotta get through the blue portal.
    Celestial portal, I think blue goes to the friendly lizard wizard
Bought it day one, played a few hours and decided to wait until it is out of early access.  Still was tons of fun tho.
    Its a ton of fun, but it takes forever to unlock characters. Its also not clear how to unlock them all.
        Well I mean they are hidden on purpose.
        i would say you're good to go ahead and look up how to unlock them - the first few characters i unlocked just by playing the game in my first 7 or so runs i reckon.  


once you get into it, you'd have to actively avoid working out/finding out how to unlock the characters.  


the artifacts however... wow there's a bit of a puzzle and also a lot of work.
        Exactly like RoR1. Great series.
        Google makes it very clear. And if it still too difficult I recommend using mods once to unlock new characters. I agree they need to do better with explaining how to unlock them though.
        [deleted]
            Thats a great idea!
        I find it super difficult!!
        I just edited my save to unlock all the characters. I told my friends to do the same. The game's more fun when you find a character you like. That first one (? I don't remember) and Huntress are fine and all but imo, are among the most boring characters. They might be your only characters after 5 hours of play too if you're doing things blind.
        It is **pretty** clear. I've owned it for write some time. Maybe you didn't look in the logs?
    I've been playing on/off since day one and I must say, go ahead and pick it back up, it's loads and loads of fun. And you'll definitely see the love that's gone in to it. Especially if you played 1 :)
    yeah, I loved 1 and bought 2 just to re-reward the developers. I fully expected the move to 3D to ruin it.

Played a few hours at the beginning of Early Access and was really surprised at how well the mechanics translated. Then I put it down because it's worth waiting for fewer bugs and more features.

Basically, it's the poster child for how Early Access should work.
August
August is 1.0.
What's the status on difficulty?  I played a ton when it first dropped and had a great time, then the update dropped that retooled difficulty and it was suddenly absolutely crushingly hard.  Like an order of magnitude more difficult, even at the normal difficulty.

Have they balanced that out at all?  My friends and I were getting absolutely demolished, to the point where it was a lot less fun compared to when it first launched.
August is the 1.0 release, I'm really excited
Sounds like a possibility of a sale! Hopefully there's a sale on switch too
Since you appreciate correct information so much, the word is spelled "explanation" ;)
    Since you also appreciate correct information so much, I just wish to say you got everything right.
    Cool thanks, didn't know that.

Yes, which is why it's one of my highly recommended games as well. The only game I know of with a better 2D->3D jump was GTA.
I’m king of the world!
    You and the dude that rick rolled rick astley should form a band and start a YouTube channel add a patreon and boom you’re getting paid fam
There are so many mods, check it out, saves you at the start of each stage.

https://thunderstore.io/package/KingEnderBrine/ProperSave/
I just used this website. https://tbfts.github.io/ror2_save_editor/ to edit my save and give me all unlocks.

It's a roguelike so you still need to get lucky to have a good playthrough but with everything unlocked at least you know all items and abilities are available to you during your run.
A fellow Brit I see.
    Central Canada actually. Usually we don’t get too much rain but the last month has been really stormy and there has been a risk of rain almost every single day. Sucks too because I’ve been wanting to go in my pool for like a week now but haven’t gotten much of a chance.
        Just go into your pool anyway. After all if it rains you're already wet.
            Is it weird that I like swimming in the rain more than swimming in bright sunshine? Just something about it.
    It was so weird for me to move to England and find out it actually rains more in my home country!

I feel lied to
That last ones an r/suspiciouslyspecific from me
Well? Does anyone have an answer to his question?
    Must be why s/he quit posting in reddit.
Except, of course, Gauntlet: Dark Legacy
    I found a copy of that for like 2 bucks at a garage sale for the ps2. I had previously owned it on xbox but had long since lost it. I still remembered where every secret was and my SO was getting annoyed because she was completely lost. Still super fun.
Blue JESTER...is about to die..
    Sometimes when I'm hungry I hear a voice in my head "Red warrior needs food badly."
Right, but Raid Shadow Legends isn’t an actual video game though. So they don’t really have much work to do. That’s what I’m getting at. 

RoR2 has a good dev team that brings us a good game. They deserve the price point for purchasing the game. 

Raid Shadow Legends is malware.
    Oh, I'm an idiot and misread your first comment as the opposite of what you were saying. Yeah I totally agree with everything you said. Well put bud
        Haha no problem dude, I figured you meant that! Hopefully what I said didn’t get conveyed as being as asshole, didn’t mean for that! 

Edit: outside of shitting on that trash heap of a “game”.
Rex is fantastic once you understand that your M2 does all the damage, M1 is minor healing and R is major healing/crowd control. He's amazing once you understand how he works
MUL-T was really tough for me to get into, but was also the first character I finished a Monsoon run with. Play with the Artifact of Command and pump some Goat Hooves into him, you may enjoy him once he's more mobile.
    I do enjoy becoming speed itself in RoR2 whenever there is a Goat hoof printer or Soda printer.
        With the artifact of command you can just make all the items you get be goat hoofs lol, you become dangerously fast, like falling of the map twenty times
I haven't been able to get past the fourth stage on Monsoon yet. I'm probably spending too much time looting in the previous stages. I always end up getting killed by the Elder Lemurians that start showing up at that time.
    Basically just blitz the first 3 rounds. Then you can chill for a bit and loot. I believe in you
That's particularly egregious because if the Engineer has them it helps everyone.
    Good thing we don't have to worry about it since the game decides not to spawn any bungus when there's an engi on the team.
