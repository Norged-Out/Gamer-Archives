[[Every base map that hasn't returned from the OG MW trilogy]]





Yeah so, if they wanted to bring back 5 maps they could just throw 5 darts at this picture and I'd be happy either way.
    Wetworks x5
        I agree but I doubt it'll happen; the entire community was in outrage because Miami was slightly dark and Cartel had bushes they couldn't see through

Seems like a majority of the community just wants easy three lane sight lines, at least the vocal part of the community
    I would lobve to see many of these maps return, especially from MW3 but Bootleg and Downturn are just awfull maps. Not necessarily how they play but they just look bad. The rest from MW3 are all great though.

I was grinding emblems and calling cards hard in MW3 and got a team wipe with the stealth bomber on Village. They were all lined up in the dried out river in the middle. It was glorious and took me ages to get that achievement.
Man sub base brings back memories. I think I got my first chopper Gunner there as a kid with a heartbeat sensor attached to an ACR and a SPAS-12 in the back pocket.
    Spas-12 🥺
        Wild the models got nerfed to oblivion and that gun was left to reign supreme the whole time 😂
            And it was a damn secondary lmao. Crazy how in mw2 most of the secondary's could compete with the primaries and there wasn't any drawback to them at all lol
                Mw2 was not a balanced game but man it was fun
                    I mean if everything was OP, didn't that really make nothing OP?

Outside of the early 1887's, there really wasn't any gun that was far above or below the rest from what I remember, outside of the AUG specifically being a bit weak maybe?
                        I want my TAR back
                            And ACR
                                yeah i loved the acr. NGL with heartbeat attached ofc
                                    All it needs is a red dot sight :) loved those iron sights too
                                MP5, Spas-12 combo. The Sandy Ravage special.
                                Acr goated for real i just want it back
                            The ram-7 did okay at being a replacement but just not the same
                            The TAR was by far my favorite weapon in multiplayer. I’m convinced they gave it good iron sights because the devs knew that the red dot was damn ugly
                            Yeah I miss that gun
                        There was something about the UMP45 that made it busted. It's been 13 years, so details are hazy, but I think it was that the regular suppressor penalties didn't apply to the UMP45, and it naturally had very low recoil with the muzzle flash removed by the suppressor, so that made it an all-round gun that could fill any role and was a menace in the right hands. It wasn't anywhere near as famous of an exploit as One Man Army and such, so it wasn't a plague on the game. Just one of those things where skilled players knew to watch out for the guy rocking a suppressed UMP45, because that player knew what was up and was definitely trying for high killstreaks.
                            Silenced UMP45 and Akimbo Rangers all. damn. day!
                                That was my go to setup to attempt to drop a nuke. Fond memories of running absolutely rampant in Favela.
                            It could double as an assault rifle because of it's crazy range, good damage, fire rate and low recoil. But the fact that it was an SMG meant you could also Rush with it. Really was a Swiss Army Knife as far as durability, and depending on the routes you navigate Multi-player maps with, Usually outclassed anything you'd come across. UMP+Spas-12 in the right hands was untouchable
                            I also remember the boost it got from stopping power was almost useless so it was the perfect smg to run with ghost
                            Yup and you could speed up the fire rate I use to run wild with it!!! Thanks for the memory lane my man!!!!
                        One man army noob tubes, commando pro, and painkiller deathstreak are the main things I remember being bullshit in that game
                            Even better in mw3 we had death mans hand as a death streak. For those fortunate enough to not have encountered such nightmare, instead of dying you entered a “final stand” stance and had a c4 remote at hand. You then roleplayed as a suicide bomber, but for some reason they gave you a pocket nuke. That shit had about a 15m radius for no reason and it always one shot no matter how far you were
                            Holy shit I forgot all about the death streaks
                                [deleted]
                                    Martyrdom and final stand. So basically the annoying "revenge" perks they got rid of from cod4
                                Holy shit I forgot all about wrecking shop with nothing but a knife and commando pro
                        IIRC the WA2000 was basically a hybrid of the disadvantages of the Intervention/Barrett (low mobility, slow ADS) with the disadvantages of the M14 (lower damage). There wasn't really a point in running it, ever.

And the whole LMG class suffered from the same problem it has suffered ever since: Not mobile enough to actually move around, and not powerful enough to camp. The RPD and MG4 were somewhat viable, but I remember the L86/AUG/M240 to be pretty shite.

And I do remember the F2000 to be pretty bad with low damage and bad recoil, but I might be misremembering that.
                            >IIRC the WA2000 was basically a hybrid of the disadvantages of the Intervention/Barrett (low mobility, slow ADS) with the disadvantages of the M14 (lower damage). There wasn't really a point in running it, ever.

It was a troll weapon. Nothing like outsniping some kids in Search with the WA and every time they see their kill cam they gotta see the smiley face sticker on the scope cover

And even then it wasn't an awful gun by any means, just was far and away the worst option for snipers. Was still a 1 shot for head, neck and chest IIRC unless you put a silencer on it
                                Yeah, certainly. In other CoDs it would probably have been considered decent, in MW2 it was not only the worst option in it's class by considerable margin, it was also outclassed by the FAL with an ACOG (or thermal scope, don't remember). I guess that fits OPs bill of a gun that was far below the rest.

But honestly I think that because there was no point in playing guns you didn't want meant that you never felt being at a disadvantage. You were never forced into unfair engagements because you needed to grind a gun to unlock something for a different gun. And since the default classes already gave you a FAMAS+SPAS, an UMP or a Barrett you were pretty much settled from the get go.
                                A bit late but actually it was the sniper rifle that didn't suffer at all with a silencer, provided you were running stopping power as usual. For example silencing the Barrett/Intervention brought their 1HKO from head+chest+stomach to head+chest. 

WA2000 was head+chest by default so the idea was to either silence it and use stopping power, or use it unsilenced without stopping power. If you were using it unsilenced with stopping power then yeah it was straight up trolling and worse than other options.

I found the latter pretty nice with cold blooded pro on the open sniping maps since people would scan for red names and killstreaks would sit in the sky 24/7.
                            The WA2000 definitely wasn't outstanding and required a pretty unique sniping playstyle, but it was far from a poor weapon and was at least on par with the Barrett if not better in the right hands. It was also the only semi auto actually viable for quick scoping and I remember seeing more than one really good player absolutely  wreck with it (it was just far less forgiving than just using the intervention, and like someone mentioned below, ironically outclassed by most things with an ACOG)

I disagree about the LMGs. The AUG and L86 definitely just felt like crappy assault rifles and didn't see much use, but the RPD, M240, and MG4 were very common and incredibly effective in Domination and Headquarters among hard objective players
                                The WA2000 was nice for anyone who crunched the numbers back then and saw it was the go to weapon for silenced+SP or unsilenced+non SP sniping.
                        Imo ump-45 was above other guns. It was good even at long distances. Talking only about HC.
                            You definitely could bink people at range in hardcore with that gun
                        I had that realization looking back. Like marathon/lightweight/commando was STUPID but so was me being able to rapid fire a barret 50 cal with a thermal scope or the lack of recoil on an RPD LMG. The game was FUN albeit chaotic fun

EDIT: Shame on me for not adding One Man Army/Danger Close and Noob tubes.
                        Y’all talking about the TAR and ACR, but the real weapon was the SCAR with FMJ rounds.
                            Big facts
                        I loved the AUG, I actually thought it was the best LMG alongside the RPD.  

I agree though, every gun being fairly strong felt good in that game.
                Called being fun. Balance isnt necessary if all of them are "strong"
            The underbarrel shotgun never got nerfed. Stopping power on it made it a long range shotgun like the models, i coined it the ‘raoul moat’ and moating was born. The whole squad would run a moat class and we kicked some major arse, steady aim made it worse tho. Andy would shout ‘moated’ with every kill. Good times. I miss og mw2.
            Dual mods was INSANE
        If you put the right attachments on the Bryson and squint hard enough, you can get spas vibes at time.
            Ive enjoyed leveling it. Seems to be legit.
            Once you get the 2nd barrel, the one that gives it max range it starts to feel like the spas 12 maybe 50% of the time
                Max range and tighter spread barrel is definitely a game changer
        I dont know why they never brought back a model similar to the Spas-12. All recent pump action shotguns all look like the old fashion boring looking type. Spas-12 looked so modern and just felt better.
            SPAS-12 return with a receiver conversion (or just an on the fly selector like it can IRL) to change between semi-auto and pump action would be super neat and extremely unique. Shotguns in COD have almost always suffered a lack of variety.
        Sandy ravage and the Spas 12 were what first got me into COD
            The SpasTec-130
        Great gun in game, horrible bulky piece of trash in real life.
    Unrelated but if we’re going down memory lane. I got my first Nuke on Afghan. It all happened because me and my little brother were messing around in split screen on PS3 and I used my PSN account on split screen and unlocked the Nuke and AC-130 just to use them in a private lobby. 

Fast forward later in the evening, I never changed my killstreaks back because I forgot. Managed to go on a 7 killstreak and had to get like the last two or three kills with sawn off Rangers I picked up from someone.
        Mine was on Wasteland. TAR-21 with underbarrel shotgun lol
            Completely forgot about the old underbarrel shotgun. Such a fun attachment!
        I got my first Nuke on Afghan as well. Ground War and I had my AC-130 up and they were spawning at the top of the cliff where B was. It was an absolute massacre.
        Nukes didn’t need to be equipped on mw2 right?
            They did. My set up was harriers, chopper Gunner, nuke
                That was everybody's setup for nukes I believe :D maybe the AC-130 instead of the chopper, depending on the person
                    If you knew how to use the AC-130, that thing absolutely SHREDDED.
                        The AC-130 took more kills to get and rarely got you enough to get the nuke. If you had them spawn camped, the AC-130 was superior. However, if they weren't spawn camped, you wanted the chopper gunner

Source: young me got over 100+ nukes and was absolutely obsessed with it
    Yup same here. First chopper on that map with a ACR HB sensor and SPAS-12. You're a man of style I see
        How the hell do y’all remember this? Do I smoke too much weed? Lmao
        Ahh the spastex-130 as it was called back then.

Good times.
    Man its the original COD4 and MW2 maps that get me. I long for the "bad" maps even like underpass.
        How dare you! I liked underpass! :D
        Absolutely loved underpass. Just slap a thermal scope on a gun and chill in the grass.
    My friends and I used to play dodgeball in one of the wider tunnels in Sub base on 4-way splitscreen. 

Teams of two, line up on opposite sides of the tunnel and then throw throwing knives at each other until one team reaches a certain score.

Man I miss the days of having a group of friends playing split screen around someone's house. It's not the same playing online.
        Haha, my friends and I used to do that too!

Same map, I *think* same place, only we tried to stick each other with semtex. Closest we could get to snowballs lol.
    I got a 57 kill streak on it with an acr/grenade launcher, claymores, and scavenger. It was insane. I got a chopper gunner in the first 45 seconds. I wish the xbox 360 had had recording cause I'd love to re-live that.
    Solid map.
    Sub base with the ACR was my first nuke!
    Got my first nuke there
    If you didn't come in this thread to talk about Sub Base or Favela idk what else

Easily the most underrated maps in CoD history. Met my lifelong friend in a 1v1 on Sub Base
    My friends and i used to party up and go on nuke streaks where we tried to go as many games in a row while getting nukes. I think our max was 6 or 7, but I’ll never forget being in sub base with the game coming  to an end and my buddy popped off with like 2 minutes left to keep our streak alive. Good memories  on that map
    UMP-45 suppressed was a beast
    A remake with it actively snowing sounds cool. Dunno if it would actually be annoying but worth a try on new console hardware
    I remember when I got my first nuke. Got it on High Rise sniping. But my last 6 kills I had to do with a pistol because I was out of ammo for my sniper
Hey IW, bring back all of these - thanks.
    I do miss downpour a lot. I feel like a reimagining of a few aspects to the layout would make this a great map.
        My COD4 disc was somehow corrupt and wouldn't play this map. So for a long time until i caved and bought a new copy, every time this map came up in the rotation my party would instantly back out because they knew i would get kicked
            I had to w same issue with firing range on black ops 1 lol
                Hah I don't feel so alone, this happened every time I tried to run ascension, which makes no since because it was dlc
                SAME
            This happened to me with Crossfire lol.
                All of these replies are such banger maps too, I feel bad for you guys haha
            Actually same, this map just never wanted to work. My game was in good condition too. I ended up borrowing a friends copy and downloading it onto my HDD. When that became a feature on Xbox 360
        Agreed, maybe just like adding another door to the dead end field on the side and getting rid of the mounted MG since they don't do those anymore, and it'd be really cool. Loved having rainy maps
        i must’ve been 12/13 when i stayed home from school because i was sick. it was pouring outside, and i was playing cod in my room, on downpour. halfway through the match i just stopped and stared outside for a solid minute watching the rain come down. something about that moment really stuck with me because i remember that moment being really special. i have so many great memories playing mw/mw2.

just wanted to share that
        This was the map that got me hooked
        i miss the giant white void maps, those were classics. running around for eternity and never seeing another player, slowly going insane as i lose perception of what's real and what isn't. wondering if there really ever were any other players to with 


also Estate, that one was a blast haha
        Downpour would be a fantastic realism mode map. Nighttime raining with NVGS
        You’d want to get rid of my Mega Machine Gun ™️ wouldn’t you
    I’d like to preface this by saying MW2 is my favorite game of all time.

Please no Derail or Wasteland.

Back then people would still be rushing into the high traffic areas even on huge maps. Nowadays derail would just be people sniping from behind random ass trees on the outskirts of the map and from the buildings. Don’t even want to think about the people who would just lay down in the grass on wasteland.

Sure it happened a bit back then, but it wasn’t whole lobbies like it seems to be now. Ironically even without a combat record, once one person starts camping it seems like the whole lobby puts up their own tents and no one moves.
        Can remember everyone thinking they sneaky as hell crawling through the grass on wasteland , thermal sniper used to destroy them
            Also the way killstreaks were in mw2, you were never really safe out in the grass. You could take cold blooded but you could easily get turned on by someone with stopping power even if you shoot first.
                There was this hut on one side I can remember vividly being in there with my 2 mates , all rocking interventions with thermals and a big stretch of field long grass to get to the hut , the best times
                    The days before sniper glint 😔
            I got my first Nuke on Wasteland using the Barrett .50 w/ ACOG. Just playing like an absolute piece of shit
                Lol the Barrett 50 cal was also a lovely rifle to use
        Yeah that's annoying but I wouldn't mind having a map that's great for snipers. Every other map is designed for running around. Give the snipers a map. Mix up the gameplay
            I would agree if ground war / invasion weren’t just roof top sniper simulators already. I feel like I already have my go to place if I want to do longer range sniping. The other maps are good for aggressive sniping already. The MSR (spx-80) is the best feeling actual sniper rifle we’ve had in a mw game since the MSR in mw3 lol
            Taraq exists
                Sure but if were talking about bringing back ALL of these maps like the first comment was saying then there's no point in leaving out 1 map because  of snipers.
                    Tbf I think it’s a bizarre wish to have all the maps back. They weren’t *all* that good
            The snipers have two whole modes to themselves
            Play Ground war/Invasion?
        I fucking loved ghillie sniping with coldblooded in Derail and Wasteland
        Derail was fun on hard-core search. Besides the across the map noob tunes. Adding a crane or something could fix that. Blocking the air
        Bog can gtfoh too
        OG MW2 is also my favourite multiplayer FPS of all time. I agree some of these maps may be janky, would love if they just put them in a nostalgia playlist.  


Skidrow, terminal sub base. all amazing maps.
        Thankyou for not some how blaming doors or the fact that this game is new or that you can hear footsteps or any other random ass thing people seem to blame for it being different than it was back then. People just play different now, they have more experience, there are more players, youtube/twitch is a thing, information is more accessible.
    Except Bog, Bog is awful for Domination

Personally I hate Estate as every game devolved into "Camp the hell out of the House"

*I notice that a lot of the MW2 maps like Karachi, Derail, and Rundown were exploitable by  OMA Noob Tubes where you could Stand on A launch a Noob Tube in the air and it'll land directly on C
        I loved Bog for domination, well I loved the summer version because I could fucking SEE.
            If you have B and C and the opponent has A  they will mostly spawn behind a walled area with one way to escape and they'll get spawn camped to hell
        Bog was a throwable fest. Grenades, flashbangs, smoke, everything is popping as often as gunfire.
            The full game was a throawble fest everyone ran frag x3
                And martyrdom
    nooo leave downturn
        Downturn
DOWNTURN!!!!
        Everyone hates Downturn.
    Lol this is how I know this sub has rose tinted glasses. I’ve been playing since CoD4 and a lot of these maps are straight up not good.
    Literally all of them. So many good memories on every map; Countdown would be HILARIOUS to see in a modern Call of Duty.
District was such a good SND map
    Not enough love here for that map. I feel like it could come back tomorrow and be a competitive map
    Why did I have to scroll so low for this lmao 

District was fucking GOATed for search ❤️
        It was so good, I don't even care dying to perfectly thrown lane nades.
    Given me memories of how everyone on defensive side would jump down the stairs, throwing grenades over the building, while people on the attacking side would shoot straight through the building from the other side to kill them.

I’d take every one of those COD4 maps back, even if I didn’t like Downpour. No added door or anything however please. Just.. the maps as they were.
    SND in Cod4 was just awesome - I can remember some moments from almost every map. District, Pipeline, Overgrown, Broadcast and Downpour especially stand out in my memory for SND, but honestly loved every map
    District and Crossfire were both great SnD maps. District was def better, though. I’d also throw Strike in that category…oh and Backlot…

Ok so CoD 4 was just amazing lol.
    District and Backlot were the best maps in CoD4 in my opinion. Both let all playstyles play to their liking and didn't have a true power position like most maps do.
    I swear everybody slept on district for SND. A man of culture, you are.
Crossfire was HUGE in CoD 4 promod, not sure why we haven’t seen it yet.

Need to kill some people with old set nades 😭
    Fuck yeah, crossfire was always my favorite.  Strike was definitely up there too.  Used to love bouncing from the sandbags by the statue in the middle to tey and quickscope people over walls lol
    Crossfire was a perfect map. Does anyone else remember the physics exploits that would let you camp on the outer walls/leave the map? Wetwork had a good one as well.
        In the old school mode where you could hop all the way out the map lol.
        I played jump mode a lot, crossifre was one of the easier maps to jump out, but easiest was backlot, I was running outside so often in non-jump matches like tdm or sad

Bloc was known for elevators

Pipeline had the easiest big bounce in middle, also very OP in TDM, people just didn't expect you there 

Showdown was very cool for jumpers, but on some spots you needed boost from friend, so not that great in regular matches, but still some nice jumps 

Crash bounce on heli was hard to do in TDM or regular play, not impossible, but also not very useful and didn't get you outside on its own 

Damn I need to find some jump servers with regular maps (not custom) to play again, it was soooo good
    Crossfire was my fuckin *jam* in COD4.
    The nostalgia hit every time I see a post about CoD4! Is the new MWII actually any good? Stumbled on this post from /r/popular!
        As someone that started really getting into COD with COD2 and COD4, I feel like MWII is a return to the good old days in many ways.
            Could you elaborate? I played scrims with clan mates back in the CoD2 and 4 days and what I miss most is the prominence of single shot rifles like Kar98k etc. I wouldn't think that sort of gameplay would be possible with modern Cod stylings.
Arkaden slapped cannot tell me otherwise...
    Arkaden was my favourite map for infected. Everybody used to use burger town as an outpost lol
        Hiding behind the counter at the burger shop was pretty much a guaranteed top-3 finish on Infected lmao
            That, and behind the escalator corners! Good memories!!
        Omg memories. Hiding behind the counter created intense bonds with your fellow survivors. Everyone had their own spot to cover and friendships were formed without even using voice chat. Until you ran out of ammo and got infected. Then your former brother in arms became your greatest enemy. 🥲
        MW3 Infected was the best version we ever had. So many nukes, or managing to get your specialist bonus and trying to find a hiding spot with 17 infected running around.
        Speaking of infected,why the hell isn’t it in the game now? So many fun memories playing that mode.
        Mannnn that shit used to be so crazy hiding behind the counter dual fmg9s trying to get them first couple kills til that scavenger hit lol ducking knives . Damn them was the days
    MW3 had some solid maps tbh. Mission, Arkaden, Underground, Lockdown and Seatown
        Seatown might be my favorite map in CoD. It's so dynamic with all the different routes you can take.  MW3 had some amazing maps, hell the DLC maps were also just as good. I wish more people liked MW3, in general. Everyone just says "it's mediocre" and that's it, but it really isn't.
            MW3’s biggest flaw is that people were getting burnt out by the MW series at that point and it was coming on the heels of Black Ops. People wanted something new and exciting, not a better version of what had come before. 

Imo, by most objective criteria it’s the best MW game of the series. Way more balanced than MW and MW2, tons of content, good maps, competitively viable but fun for casual play. The support killstreaks and specialist perk system were both really good additions, Stopping Power being gone freed up a lot of class creation options, nukes (sorry—MOABs) didn’t end games, it was just a ton of fun to play.
                totally agree with you, MW3 will always have a special place in my heart, I mean it's noy BO2 but I would argue a second place for sure.
                I just wanted more guns and more dlc maps lol
            > the DLC tracts were also just as good

I would kill for them to bring back Sanctuary, Piazza, Black Box, Liberation, Boardwalk, or Foundation - all such great maps
        And resistance the French one. Mw3 was a banger I’ll die on this hill lol. Also sitrep pro for soundwhoring to the max, it even cancelled out dead silence 😂
        I miss mission, village, arkaden etc!
        Bakaara was amazing as well, long sightlines and cool interiors


I also used to hate Lockdown, then one day 
 Wii servers got hacked, and it became the ONLY map in rotation
    If they bring back infected… They need to bring Arkaden back.

Best map ever for that mode imo.
    phenomenal map
    Amazing for infected and all or nothing too
I miss sub base and trailer park from mw2.
    MW2 had some very good DLC maps
        Definitely. I loved trailer park, liked the theme park one (forget the name). There were several other solid ones
            Carnival!!
    Trailer park was very very good.
I can't wait to play terminal
    is it back??
        Terminal came back in infinite warfare. Not sure it's coming back in this game
            There's rumours that the big expansion in stead of a new game next year will have every OG MW2 map. See: xclusive ace's video on it.
                A bit bull shit to charge for it when the game launched with almost no maps. I thought the whole point of the cosmetics and battle pass were to farm whales and use them to push out content to keep engagement. Kinda lame to double dip
                    I agree the game launched unfinished but this will be at the normal end of the life cycle. If it were vanguard it would only be just out this month. 

I wouldn't say it's double dipping but I do agree that the current state of the game is unacceptable for the price.
                    It's just like mw2 days with DLC map packs. Full nostalgia of being a young teen and not being able to afford enough Microsoft points to get the new map pack
            It's confirmed that Terminal map is inside the new Warzone 2 map. So it's just a matter of time for them to use it in MP.
            Quarry, Terminal, Shipment, Afghan and Highrise are all on the Warzone 2 map.

You can find them if you setup a private match on Al Bagra Fortress, allow free cam and go into spectator mode.
If IW / Activision don’t hop on the easy money that is releasing OG maps remastered then they clearly lack knowledge on their fan base. 

By remaster all I ask is that you update the look, don’t break what isn’t broke.
    [deleted]
        I am still sore from them not releasing Firing Range in Cold War. My favorite COD map of all time!
            I think they thought it was just done too many times. Would have been fun though
                Yet they release nuketown every 3 years without fail
        Such good times on Cold War with the OG maps. I think that because they added OG maps singularly made the game 1000% more fun.
    All they need to do is add 30-40 cars that can be exploded and plop them in the centre of all these maps. Perfection.
        If I don’t get a dozen doors in the central building of each map I’m going to cry.
    In previous games, they've released throwback maps, and been called lazy for it.

But when they don't do it, they "lack knowledge of their fan base".
    The maps would still play completely differently to how they were originally. Take the remastered maps on BO4 for example. Faster movement, new equipment, etc. They might as well have been different maps since they played so differently to the original game
    They clearly lack the knowledge of their fan base yet they just released a COD that made $1,000,000,000 in one week? Interesting.
        I would love to know how many people thought this game would 

1. Come with MW2 maps
2. Work reliably and not crash on consoles & pc
3. Come with barracks, leaderboards.

It’s probably extremely high. First week sales are nothing more than their marketing teams success. Maintaining high sales and player count will show that people actually enjoy the game long term.
            Points 2 and 3 are completely valid. I hoped for those as they are base functions of a complete game so they dropped the ball there. I’m just saying it’s funny to say Activision isn’t in touch with their fans. They don’t care! They’re laughing all the way to the bank with a BILLION dollars. They do not care about any of the complaints, or being in touch with the community - we have showed them they don’t have to.
NOSTALGIA
    Boy does it hit HARD.
    My heart, I absolutely loved Cod4, it was my first game with friends

Now I hear there's a new MW out but I don't have an Xbox anymore and am not used to pc controls.

Apparently it's only like $75 for one and the game for like $30? Idk, but would love to get back
Excluding CoD4 remastered
    And cod mobile I'm guessing
        Yeah just the main games. Didn't even consider mobile.
            You just dropped a tactical nuke on r/callofdutymobile
                Man those 3 people are going to be pissed
    Did they ever bring back Favela? I feel like they haven’t yet
        In Ghosts.
Bloc OMG! ❤️
    Surprised that wasn't brought back in mw2019
        There were no gun fights in that map. It was just sniping and flanking
            It was a fun map though, Not everyone played like it was life and death like this mw2
                Dude I’ve been thinking this. People don’t play COD like they used to. It wasn’t nearly as big of a deal as people make it now.
                    Everyone wants to be a streamer, YouTuber, tiktoker. We have an era of sweats that back then you weren’t competing with other sweats, but with casuals and ping/connection was the way we used to be in a lobby
                        Everyone wanted to be mlg back then and would lie about being sponsored. Thing is we've gotten wayyy better at fps games. Red tiger was hard a fuck to get on controller back then despite being a laughable 150 headshots. I think I remember seeing a single gold camo gun back in mw1 (outside degal ofc) and I played a fuckload. We always tried hard, we just sucked. Everyone just wants to pop off and get a bunch of kills, not much has changed
                    I used to hop on, play a few matches, scratch that itch with a couple of snipes. Now, I am constantly reviewing every aspect of the game and how I can improve
                    Yeah those old MW and MW2 days were the best. No bunny hops, slides, 1000 sensitivity spin shit.

I used to actually get top of the board back then quite frequently. My skills have defo deteriorated with age but the game has also just turned super sweaty and unrealistic now
                        You telling me you didn’t play with 12 sensitivity and run across the map with a USP and knife and a Intervention?
                True, there was a methodical playstyle to some of those Cod4 maps
            People don’t realize what made these maps all fun is the diversity of play style. Nowadays all maps hit the same criteria and make sure everything is overly consistent
                Remember 15 years ago when only a a small percentage or people had turtle beach head sets and dead silence was optional.
                    I had turtle beach, thought it looked so bad ass but was so cheaply made lol
            I feel like it would be a perfect fit for mwii, just needs more clutter inside each building, and 50 feet more of unnecessary space behind each spawn
    This was my favourite COD4 map, absolutely loved it
    If they added some more cover in the middle I think it would play very nicely while still having a similar feel.
    biggest slept on map, it was actually unique
    Hell yes. I feel like we're prob in the minority liking this one. Brings back the memories.
    Bloc is the best map in COD history, and that’s a hill I’m willing to die on
Sea Town, Lockdown, Village, Mission, and Outpost from MW3 need to come back...

God I miss Sea Town...
    you my type of guy
    I came here looking for this.
Seatown and lockdown. 🔥
    Same. Lots of fun on that map
    What game did they bring back Dome for? I must have missed that
        Also Ghosts, DLC map remake
(And Strike Zone, base map, had a VERY similar layour)
        It’s likely to be in MW22 anyway, Mount Zaya (Spec Ops mission) is the exact layout.
    Besides downturn, MW3 had no bad maps.
        Carbon was an insta skip for me. And maybe everyone because I barely remember playing it, it would always skip. It just had a terrible flow to it, in my opinion.
            MW3 was my first COD game, and seeing all of the maps brought back so many good memories. Then I saw Carbon. I have no memories of Carbon lmao
    I liked fallen as well actually.

Seatown and Lockdown were legit!
    How is Sea Town not in Al Mazra, such a missed opportunity
Bring back SUB BASE! I love snow maps
    Derail 💀

That one can stay down. Although as I've played it since the game has been "dead", it's grown on me
Quary is in the new Warzone Map, if that counts
    Once it is added to MWII it'll count
        Remind me to comment again next Wednesday **;)**
            why's that? Are they releasing it in the map pool then too?
                I think it’s just conjecture rn but it would be a wildly tone deaf move to not release it. So yeah they probably won’t lmao
    Pretty sure there's a couple on the new warzone map. Terminal, highrise, mw3 dome, and quarry like you said
        Showdown is also on Wz 2 map
            Are you serious omggg
                Yeah I think it was in a trailer or some footage they released
                [https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2022/09/call-of-duty-next-warzone-new-era-al-mazrah-map-intel-guide](https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2022/09/call-of-duty-next-warzone-new-era-al-mazrah-map-intel-guide)  
look it up  
"Ahkdar Village" :)
                    An old town fit for a showdown 😎
        Dome is one of the areas playable in Spec Ops, it's the defense mission.
        Also Afghan.
Makes me realise how great some of the MW3 maps actually were looking at this, damn!
    Agreed! Good memories on Bootleg, Fallen, Mission, Seatown & Village.
        That game really was a top 5 cod of all time, might even be top 3 for me!
            Honestly, I know it's controversial, but it's my favorite CoD. Very satisfying campaign, way more balanced than MW2, while retaining the speed and fluidity from it that BO1 lacked. Infected was incredible, as was kill confirmed. Extremely fun and dynamic maps. Good times man. I wish more people liked it
                Yeah same. For me it had the best weapon selection and perks in the series. It introduced weapon levelling, score streaks and specialist. Then there was infected, drop zone, juggernaut game modes etc. Man the game was endless fun.
                It’s always amazed me that so many people say MW2 was better. That’s gotta be pure nostalgia speaking, because MW3 was basically the same exact game mechanically but with better maps and better balance.
                    The one thing I'll say in MW2's favor is the presentation felt more "video game-y." By that I mean the sound effects and colors were a bit more cartoony and fun, whereas MW3 felt like the more serious older brother with everything being gray and brown and the sounds more muted.
                        Yeah I can see that. MW2 had brighter colors for sure.
                    MW 2 is my favorite but it’s also the one I had the most playtime in by far. Had 1500+ hours in it compared to 300-400 in mw3. Pretty much stopped playing COD after that.
                They need to bring back the guitar solos and explosions that happen every time I level up. It’s honestly shocking they don’t try harder to capitalize on that nostalgia. Felt so badass doing basic things
                By far my favourite. Then its BO2. But the gap is pretty big.
                    For me it’s 1A. BO2 1B. MW3
            mw1/2/3 & bo1/2 easy top 5 in any order
        I forgot about Fallen. That map was amazing!
    I never see anybody talk about Interchange but I LOVED that map. I got my first MOAB on that map
I always thought MW2 had the GOAT maps but now I'm looking.... COD 4s fucking bang
    Always has been. CoD4 has been top tier always.

MW2 received a shit ton on flak back then, just as much as modern CoD games have been receiving. It’s just that the squeakers who came into the franchise via MW2 grew up and got a voice on the internet, slowly changing the perception around that game.
        Definitely a hot take but I've never been a huge fan of most cod 4 maps. 

I love things like vacant or overgrown but maps like Bog just turn into an M16 and m40 headglitch fest. 

Some CoD4 maps just feel like a WW1 trench to me and arent fun. 

Obviously I'd rather have something like crossfire over downturn but if Bog never came back I wouldn't be upset.
        I probably played more MWII back in the day, but you're absolutely spot on. COD4 was absolutely fantastic; and whilst MWII was great fun, holy fuck did it have horrendous issues. So many straight up broken perk combinations etc.

It's definitely rose tinted glasses for many; I can't remember being so frustrated at a MP game than I did at MWII back on the 360 - and that was even playing with a load of good friends back when I was in college with no worries.
Arkaden was really good, wonder why it never returned
    arkaden slapped fr
I think it was Ambush that was incredible for ninja defuses in Search and Destroy. One of the points had grass next to it and you'd just lay there waiting and instantly start defusing as they run off to watch somewhere. It was glorious.
    Now you’d have to slowly crouch walk to the bomb or make sure nobody hears your “KILL ME PLEASE” alarm your dead silence makes.
    Ambush was great on Headquarters too
You just unlocked memories I didn’t know I had. Is my life just measured by Call of Duty releases?
    What a great way to date memories
Man Cod4 had some great maps
    Loved playing Crossfire, it felt like a good short/medium/long range mix map for every playstyle.
I miss Ambush and Crossfire so much, those were great maps.
*Sad modern game live service noises*
    Loved crossfire. Favorite cod4 map by a mile.
        This was the map where after "The Matrix" from zzirGrizz dropped everyone tried to do those ACOG M40A3 360 noscope crossmaps down the middle lane.
    The sniper battles I had in Crossfire were \*chef's kiss\*

There was a 24/7  Crossfire server that I frequented. Loved it so much. Same people were on all the time in addition to randoms. I miss dedicated servers.
        I remember that server! Just pure fun.
    Crossfire was amazing, seeing that photo brings back some memories
    Both incredible maps. I always loved Ambush for SnD. It might be too open for it to be great now though.
    I need Crossfire back in my life
    I feel like they should add Ambush and just remove Taraq. Taraq feels like the Walmart version of Ambush.
Wasteland. What an era. Harrier Pavelow Chopper Gunner RIP lobby. Or 1 kill away from nuke and thermal sniped/noob tubed from across the map. Either way what a time.
    Wasteland is actually a remake map

https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Brecourt_(map)
    Thermal WA2000 on wasteland was my first nuke ever
Ambush, Estate, Skidrow would be great
Many good memories on village
    Great kill confirmed map
Crossfire is a Top 5 CoD map all time for me. Would be awesome to see it back.
Please God, oh God no, no Bloc. Imagine all the glint's on the second floors.
    Bloc and Bog would play so horrifically with this games mechanics it’s not even funny.
        [deleted]
    I fucking loved Bloc, sneaking from side to side with an SMG rinsing hard scoped snipers.
    I'm i the only one who likes bloc lol
It’s cuz there’s not enough windows and hidey holes on these maps
    Yes but if we learned anything from mw they will just add areas and doors and buildings that were normally inaccessible to these maps to "reflect the changes in the franchise"
    These maps are full of those things lol did you play them?
        lots of them definitely are. Karachi, Derail, Invasion, Rundown, even Sub base. Thats why the top comment is saying they got killstreaks hiding around with a heartbeat sensor and shotgun on sub base, lol

Skidrow and Highrise would be the best maps to bring back, i think.
I think it’s for a reason tbh. Some of the old map designs would be shit on today for horrible spawn traps or for being able to camp endlessly. If they do come back at all, they won’t be 1:1 remakes.
Skidrow🥺
    Miss that long corridor at the top of the stairs :(
I don’t see a lot of these maps talked about but honestly I really miss Estate, Skidrow and Downpour
Not sure how popular Seatown was but damn i enjoyed that map a lot on MW3
I guess what I really wanted after all actually was just a remaster lol
Would love to see Mission and Underground return
Showdown and Quarry have been found in the game
Invasion, Crossfire, Seatown... Such amazing maps with all that potential
I would be so hyped for Derail, Sub Base, Downpour, Underpass, Estate and Skid Row
    I loved Derail.
I miss the 1v1 maps and mode from MW3, but not as much as I miss gunfight.
    Erosion could comeback as a 6v6 map and people would love it
Bring back the OG mw2 maps! specially estate and quarry.
Be nice if they had a good way to port these over. Most of the new maps suck and there honestly is not enough MP maps in general.
any of these would be better than half of the maps we have right now
    ALL the maps\*
    Honestly the maps aren't even bad comparing them to 2019 they are quite good on obj modes. Absolutely dreadful tdm and ffa maps tho
Holy shit Bakaara was so good.
Bakaara is slept on. IMO it's a better Crash.
Holy shit I played so much MW2...
The nostalgia is making me sad :/
man MW3 had some sick maps
I miss wasteland sub base and quarry those were the shit
Edit: I can’t forget Estate either
I really would love Wasteland to come back, miss that one
Bog, Showdown, Aarkaden, Seatown. I beg you IW.
For me, 5 on each game:

Bog, countdown, crossfire, showdown, wetwork.
Estate, invasion, quarry, skidrow, subbase.
Arkaden, bootleg, carbon, lockdown, mission.
This post made me realize that I love so many mw3 maps
Thank you so much for the nostalgia... Sucks some of those maps were in the MW2019 game files and never came to fruition.
Cod 4 had amazing maps across the board.
Damn MW3 had some fantastic maps
I want every CoD4 and MW2 map back. Literally the best fps maps ever made.
Skidrow, Karachi, and Invasion need to come back. They would still hold up in today's game.
I just want overgrown, and ambush.
I may be old but those COD4 MW maps were some of the best maps ever made. There was just something about the way the played and flowed that I never really hated a map I really loved them all. 

For sure some more than others, call it nostalgia but I just don’t think they’ve made a better overall map package in a COD since. (Good maps in other CODs just not all good imo like COD4)
I don't know why, but looking at each of these pictures makes me a bit emotional. When I see the names & pictures, I can still do a virtual walkthrough of all of these maps, at least the ones from the original MW2.
    It does bring up memories.
I didn’t realize how much I miss these maps until you laid them all out like this.  So many good memories.
Where Favela at?
    That's a good question of the best ever.
Terminal is back? I don’t see it on here. Would love a Sub Base redo. And Estate would be a great throwback
    It returned in MW3 & IW. Sub Base would be good, the game needs a snow map.
        Derail really needs to make a comeback.
        What about High Rise?
            Returned in AW.
Looking at this brings back some fond memories of playing MW2 split screen with my neighbors. Terminal, Highrise, Favela, Quarry, Rust and Sub base are still among my all time favorite maps in COD.
I don't think its technically a base map but i miss overgrown badly.
    It was a CoD4 base map but returned in MW2.
I think the reason infinity ward won’t give us these maps is that Activision is worried that if the Fanbase gets the perfect, most complete call of duty game, they won’t buy future iterations.
Ahh… Skidrow.

Got my first ever nuke on that map.

I was 16 at the time.

I feel old. 👴
They should bring back 3 of these with every season
    Agreed.
Some games on crossfire were crazy. That tight fucking alley with 20 people in it moving the line inch by inch. Overgrown saw a return? Which game?
    MW2 for Overgrown. It hasn't returned since though. It's due a return. Yeah some spots on Crossfire were mental.
What a dose of nostalgia this morning! One thing is for sure, I've been playing COD ALONG time lol
There's a good handful on here I'd love to see return
Adding every map from og MW2 would immediately make this game 73x better. It seems so simple idk what stops them from doing something like this. Is it ego?
If I could only pick 3 of these I'd pick seatown, sub base, and crossfire
i'm hoping the paid DLC next year includes every single MW series map
I dont know if its nostalgia kicking in but I feel like all of these maps would actually work very well as a remaster.
    I think so too.
Ahhhh when cod actually had some creative developers. These maps had so much replay ability, I literally played hours upon hours. Nowadays I can’t play 2 hours without getting burnt out
    Fuck man looking at these maps has brought back so many memories, back in the day I was a heavy survival is better than Zombies guy, I’m going to look for my copy of MW3 when I get home from work and play some survival mode

Edit: Fuck, old school spec ops! I need to find that disc ASAP
So many good maps its hard to even pick
Can't wait to play good maps with the shitty squad spawn system!
Arkaden hit different
**Top 3 from the list provided:**  
\- Bloc  
\- Estate  
\- Crossfire
    Crossfire? Really?
        Crossfire was amazing, that said sniping back then was more challenging.
        LOL yeah them buses were great to catch anyone off-guard..
Oh don’t  worry! All those maps will be offered in 2023 with our new price plan of only $70 for additional content.
Didn’t crossfire come back in some way? Or am I Misremembering?
    Black ops 1 had a similar layout map called Havana. It had the same sort of Z structure.
    CoD4 remastered? I excluded that game however.
        Maybe! I can’t remember where I’ve played it again but i feel like I have lol
            It was on Mobile.
Give us skip row I loved that map
Bring back face off mode from mw3. Erosion and Aground were fun af.
Would love downpour again. Especially for snd
Feel like rundown was slept on. Absolutely loved that map
Countdown was insane, dropped plenty of 35-40 kill games in TDM on that
Want Mission and Seatown bad..
Remember derail.. even the worst map in mw2 wipes the floor with any new ones
    MW2 has a fantastic variety of maps. It's what this game is really lacking.
Be real. At least 1/4th of these were hated.
Fuck I would kill for a 1:1 remake of downpour. I used to love that map so much
Bloc wasn't a particularly "great" map by any means but I still miss it
Underpass ....or any map with rain please
Not a single map in this image I wouldn’t prefer over all but maybe 2 of the new maps this release.
They’d bring back Derail, Underpass, and Estate knowing these clowns 😂
like half of the maps listed were remakes of older cod maps anyways lol
Really like derail. I think that was the map where me and my buddy would go off in the corner and use tac insert and kill each other for weapons xp
    I remember doing that for camos
wasteland is a remake
I'm gonna rate these maps for shits and giggles.

Ambush - 7/10, had a crazy game of sabotage on this map once.

Bloc - 4/10. Hated this map

Bog - 7/10, chaos in a good way

Countdown - 8/10, catch me with an M40 on the silos

Crossfire - 10/10. Incredible SnD map

District - 8/10. Bit clusterfucky but great SnD map.

Downpour - 5/10. Meh

Showdown - 9/10. great map for pubs. So simple but effective.

Wet Work - 6/10. Santa Sena with no cars.

Derail - 6/10. Slightly too big. half the map is never used.

Estate - 7/10. Decent but visibility wasn't great in MW2, would be terrible in MW22.

Karachi - 8/10. Great for SnD/Demo

Quarry - 8/10. Pretty good, IW don't you dare have the map flooded for 6v6.

Rundown - 7/10. Nothing special but its decent.

Skidrow - 9/10. Love this map but it was pretty divisive from what I can remember.

Sub Base -7/10. Get rid of the fog and it gets a bonus point.

Underpass - 6/10. Downpour v2

Wasteland - 6/10. I don't think this map would work in 2022.

Arkaden - 9/10. Great map.

Bakaara - 6/10. Meh

Bootleg - 7/10. Pretty good but nothing special.

Carbon - 4/10. Not a fan

Downturn - 3/10. Shit.

Fallen - 6/10. Its okay

Interchange - 3/10. Shit

Lockdown - 7/10. Got a double MOAB on a game of Demo. Good times.

Mission - 7/10. Pretty good.

Outpust - 4/10. Shit visibility and boring map in general

Seatown - 8/10. Cool map.

Underground - 9/10. Probably and 8/10 but its London so it gets a bonus point. 

Village - 7/10. Nothing special.

I'd probably enjoy all the maps above a 7 coming back but theres a clear quality difference in CoD4/MW2 maps compared to MW3 and beyond from IW.
Anyone also buy this game thinking these were the maps they were going to play.....? Cuz.... same.
I want them all.  But I had the most fun on Karachi and Skidrow.  PLEASE bring them back.
I hope we get some awesome maps back in MW22

The shipment map was hilarious and the training site map in MW19 were great. I also hope we get more maps that you can go underwater in. It’s strangely fun
OG MW2 had such great maps, LOVED skidrow, and Rundown. Pretty sure my first nuke was on skidrow.

 Highrise and Favela will always be my favourites though.
Don’t worry, they’ll put it out next year for $70
I'd be ecstatic if we got sub base, crossfire, wet work, underpass, underground, downpour, estate, skidrow, and probably a few more. I really just want them to release a ton of old map content. I'd probably pay a full $60 to have all the classic MW/MW2 maps back on this new engine.
MWII has the worst collection of maps
Am I the only one who's wanted to play creek again? It was part of cod 4s only dlc map pack. It had a big ravine in the middle with a cave going through the middle.
    I loved that map. The only reason I bought the CoD4 map pack is because I thought that map looked cool.
Not a bad map on there. MW22 maps seem so watered down in comparison
Really miss ambush, district, crossfire, underpass and quarry
Skid Rowwwwwww
MwII would benefit from literally any of these. The current maps all have similar vibes to it. It needs more variety!
Its funny they try and spend all these resources making new maps when the good ones have been here all along..
Bring back every mw2 map PLEASE
As to quote Harry Potter, I'll take the lot
hhoooya! thanks for this OP!!  This brungs back so many great memories!
Maybe it's just nostalgia but I really miss OG MW2 maps. seems like they had a better mix of long mid and short range type maps.
Man I really don’t think CoD 4 had a single bad map
What we will get instead:
Shipment and Shoot House. 

PLEASE STOP PUTTING
SHIPMENT IN EVERY COD WHILE THESE MAPS GO UNTOUCHED
Just reminds me why CoD4 had the best balance of every title ever made. Glad I enjoyed it and savoured it back new
Why don’t they bring  them back?

*50,000 people used to live here....*
    Nostalgia.
Really? I haven't played the new MW2, but I figured a major point of doing that would be releasing with the old maps. If not, what's the point?
Tbh if you held this photo more than a couple feet from my face I'd think it was an art piece because of how much the colors blend together
The old MW2 maps give me so much nostalgia but I feel if they came back so many people would moan about how open they are with the likes of derail and afgan.  
Remember flanking around in derail with EBR silenced due to white ghillie suit it gave you. And using the Javelin on Afghan to kill people on the opposite side of the map who were pushing the middle XD
I’m pretty pissed honestly, I thought they were re-releasing MW2. I spend $70 bucks on it and there’s not one single map from MW2. WTF!
How didn’t they make a bad map back then? The only map I ever remember backing out of was derail and that was only a few times. Estate, Underpass, Village, Quarry,  Karachi and Subbase all need to be re added instantly
I want some OG maps period. Gimme another Carentan, Brecourt Manor, Even Foy. Foy was dope. Even had tanks and half tracks. Perfect for the new vehicles.
I'd be down for every single past map making a return. I have no nostalgia for this series but I know lots of people would love to see that. But I hope it would be a different team and not detract from the main development team doing something new.
Crossfire not being brought back tells me all I need to know about these new games. No thanks.
Loved running downhill in Crossfire, never forget
Was pipeline not a launch map in COD4?
    Yes, it returned in AW.
They bring back quarry and imma teach these kids a history lesson
Highrise?
No Favela?
Where is overgrown? My favourite map from MW4.
Terminal isn't on this list why? One of the best maps. Wasteland, Skidrow and Estate are also great and need to be added
They are gonna see this post then make a groundwar map outta wasteland smh
Estate, Invasion, Wasteland, Arkaden, Bootleg, Carbon, Lockdown, Outpost, Seatown and Underground NEED to come back
Estate 🥺
How hard is it to just throw them all in one huge dlc. I’d pay $50 to play all of the OG maps lol
When Call of Duty was Call of Duty, not an algorithm generating engagement and randomness.
Okay but bringing back the old maps is going to be harder than you think. All the new movement in the game can completely break the maps' intended flow. In some of the old maps here, there are tall walls to divide the map into sections, but with MW2's new hanging and vaulting mechanics and systems, almost all of those walls are irrelevant. 


Sure, some maps would remain largely unaffected, but you can't ignore the struggles for the vast majority.
    Ok when you port over the old map, do some minor changes to the walls so they are taller/ have clutter and can’t be vaulted. Surely small changes like this are much quicker than creating entirely new maps??
    That just makes it more hectic and fun!
    They just change the height of the walls like they did in Backlot and Crash from MW19. There are plenty of ways to avoid these issues
I know they've done multiple remakes of these two, but can we PLEASE get Crash and Vacant. Those two are easily in the top 10 CoD maps of all time.
If they added ALL of these maps in the second year, I could justify spending the $70 they want. If not, idk how they can charge $70 for something they didn’t add in the first place
    Games have been $60 for nearly 20 years. I do not know why people think inflation shouldn't apply to games
We need Bog back for the meme. Too bad the M16 blows this game
Honestly, so many good maps. Why don’t devs ever bring them back? I just don’t get it. Fans would want it, sales would increase

Golly all of them are just amazing honestly. Wasteland can die tho
MW2 Highrise
I dont see favela or im just blind
    Remade in Ghosts
Am I drunk or is favela not in the pic?
    Remade in Ghosts
You know this isn't a remaster or remake right? It is a whole new game and continuation of the story afterall
Where's Overgrown?
why do you guys want to stay in the past so bad
    Probably cos the new games are fucking shit by comparison lol
no love for Estate?  My favourie map ever, noobtubes throught the greenhouse. wallbanging the wooden walls, awesome
Bloc is the best map of all cods hands down!
Bloc was always the GOAT
Give me estate and derail.
I like all these maps. Like, legitimately like them and they're ALL better than MWIIs maps...
I'm so glad Estate hasn't ruined any other game.
When were mw2 (2009) maps used in modern cods ? Afghan, favela, overgrown ?
    Overgrown was originally CoD4. Favela was in Ghosts. Afghan was in IW.
Ambush 👍

Bloc 👍

Bog 👍 

Countdown 👍

Showdown 👍

Wet Work 👍

Crossfire: no memory

District: no memory

Downpour: bad

Derail: Walking simulator for 5 mins then you get shot by a sniper from the end of the map. That or some guy in that tiny room by the stairs is waiting for you. Or a claymore as soon as you get on the stairs. Fuck that fucking map. 


Estate: This can be fun in LAN but online was just people taking the house and defending it. Kinda like Mercado in MW2022 now with that house that has a balcony. 

Invasion: 👍

Karachi: meh

Quarry: meh

Rundown: meh

Skidrow: 👍


Sub base: 👍 

Underpass: meh

Wasteland: 👍👍👍


Afghan: where is it in this picture? 

MW3 maps all suck except lockdown, dome and the one at the construction site. I don't remember its name.

edit

Hardhat.
    Afghan was remade in IW. I wasn't expecting Wasteland to get three thumbs up!
        > I wasn't expecting Wasteland to get three thumbs up!

It's actually a remake

https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Brecourt_(map)
            Wow I had no idea
Most of these maps are trash theres like 5 good maps here
    These Maps are 100x better than the new ones.
When was Terminal brought back then?

And I'm sure another cod 4 map hasn't been brought back yet
    Modern Warfare 3 & Infinite Warfare
        Mw3 is classed as OG since it was the original modern warfare. Never knew about IW though
            Yeah they updated it to be more Space-y, but it was only a graphics change.
            Yeah I didn't include maps if they returned in MW2 or MW3 either. The only 2 that fit that criteria are Overgrown & Strike from CoD4 which have only returned in MW2.
    They brought it back on MW3 and Infinite Warfare
    Terminal was in Infinite Warfare :)
Bring back Derail, cowards. The sleeper hit of MW2
    [deleted]
    Search and destroy on Derail was so good
Wetworks x5
    I agree but I doubt it'll happen; the entire community was in outrage because Miami was slightly dark and Cartel had bushes they couldn't see through

Seems like a majority of the community just wants easy three lane sight lines, at least the vocal part of the community
I would lobve to see many of these maps return, especially from MW3 but Bootleg and Downturn are just awfull maps. Not necessarily how they play but they just look bad. The rest from MW3 are all great though.

I was grinding emblems and calling cards hard in MW3 and got a team wipe with the stealth bomber on Village. They were all lined up in the dried out river in the middle. It was glorious and took me ages to get that achievement.
Spas-12 🥺
    Wild the models got nerfed to oblivion and that gun was left to reign supreme the whole time 😂
        And it was a damn secondary lmao. Crazy how in mw2 most of the secondary's could compete with the primaries and there wasn't any drawback to them at all lol
            Mw2 was not a balanced game but man it was fun
                I mean if everything was OP, didn't that really make nothing OP?

Outside of the early 1887's, there really wasn't any gun that was far above or below the rest from what I remember, outside of the AUG specifically being a bit weak maybe?
                    I want my TAR back
                        And ACR
                            yeah i loved the acr. NGL with heartbeat attached ofc
                                All it needs is a red dot sight :) loved those iron sights too
                            MP5, Spas-12 combo. The Sandy Ravage special.
                            Acr goated for real i just want it back
                        The ram-7 did okay at being a replacement but just not the same
                        The TAR was by far my favorite weapon in multiplayer. I’m convinced they gave it good iron sights because the devs knew that the red dot was damn ugly
                        Yeah I miss that gun
                    There was something about the UMP45 that made it busted. It's been 13 years, so details are hazy, but I think it was that the regular suppressor penalties didn't apply to the UMP45, and it naturally had very low recoil with the muzzle flash removed by the suppressor, so that made it an all-round gun that could fill any role and was a menace in the right hands. It wasn't anywhere near as famous of an exploit as One Man Army and such, so it wasn't a plague on the game. Just one of those things where skilled players knew to watch out for the guy rocking a suppressed UMP45, because that player knew what was up and was definitely trying for high killstreaks.
                        Silenced UMP45 and Akimbo Rangers all. damn. day!
                            That was my go to setup to attempt to drop a nuke. Fond memories of running absolutely rampant in Favela.
                        It could double as an assault rifle because of it's crazy range, good damage, fire rate and low recoil. But the fact that it was an SMG meant you could also Rush with it. Really was a Swiss Army Knife as far as durability, and depending on the routes you navigate Multi-player maps with, Usually outclassed anything you'd come across. UMP+Spas-12 in the right hands was untouchable
                        I also remember the boost it got from stopping power was almost useless so it was the perfect smg to run with ghost
                        Yup and you could speed up the fire rate I use to run wild with it!!! Thanks for the memory lane my man!!!!
                    One man army noob tubes, commando pro, and painkiller deathstreak are the main things I remember being bullshit in that game
                        Even better in mw3 we had death mans hand as a death streak. For those fortunate enough to not have encountered such nightmare, instead of dying you entered a “final stand” stance and had a c4 remote at hand. You then roleplayed as a suicide bomber, but for some reason they gave you a pocket nuke. That shit had about a 15m radius for no reason and it always one shot no matter how far you were
                        Holy shit I forgot all about the death streaks
                            [deleted]
                                Martyrdom and final stand. So basically the annoying "revenge" perks they got rid of from cod4
                            Holy shit I forgot all about wrecking shop with nothing but a knife and commando pro
                    IIRC the WA2000 was basically a hybrid of the disadvantages of the Intervention/Barrett (low mobility, slow ADS) with the disadvantages of the M14 (lower damage). There wasn't really a point in running it, ever.

And the whole LMG class suffered from the same problem it has suffered ever since: Not mobile enough to actually move around, and not powerful enough to camp. The RPD and MG4 were somewhat viable, but I remember the L86/AUG/M240 to be pretty shite.

And I do remember the F2000 to be pretty bad with low damage and bad recoil, but I might be misremembering that.
                        >IIRC the WA2000 was basically a hybrid of the disadvantages of the Intervention/Barrett (low mobility, slow ADS) with the disadvantages of the M14 (lower damage). There wasn't really a point in running it, ever.

It was a troll weapon. Nothing like outsniping some kids in Search with the WA and every time they see their kill cam they gotta see the smiley face sticker on the scope cover

And even then it wasn't an awful gun by any means, just was far and away the worst option for snipers. Was still a 1 shot for head, neck and chest IIRC unless you put a silencer on it
                            Yeah, certainly. In other CoDs it would probably have been considered decent, in MW2 it was not only the worst option in it's class by considerable margin, it was also outclassed by the FAL with an ACOG (or thermal scope, don't remember). I guess that fits OPs bill of a gun that was far below the rest.

But honestly I think that because there was no point in playing guns you didn't want meant that you never felt being at a disadvantage. You were never forced into unfair engagements because you needed to grind a gun to unlock something for a different gun. And since the default classes already gave you a FAMAS+SPAS, an UMP or a Barrett you were pretty much settled from the get go.
                            A bit late but actually it was the sniper rifle that didn't suffer at all with a silencer, provided you were running stopping power as usual. For example silencing the Barrett/Intervention brought their 1HKO from head+chest+stomach to head+chest. 

WA2000 was head+chest by default so the idea was to either silence it and use stopping power, or use it unsilenced without stopping power. If you were using it unsilenced with stopping power then yeah it was straight up trolling and worse than other options.

I found the latter pretty nice with cold blooded pro on the open sniping maps since people would scan for red names and killstreaks would sit in the sky 24/7.
                        The WA2000 definitely wasn't outstanding and required a pretty unique sniping playstyle, but it was far from a poor weapon and was at least on par with the Barrett if not better in the right hands. It was also the only semi auto actually viable for quick scoping and I remember seeing more than one really good player absolutely  wreck with it (it was just far less forgiving than just using the intervention, and like someone mentioned below, ironically outclassed by most things with an ACOG)

I disagree about the LMGs. The AUG and L86 definitely just felt like crappy assault rifles and didn't see much use, but the RPD, M240, and MG4 were very common and incredibly effective in Domination and Headquarters among hard objective players
                            The WA2000 was nice for anyone who crunched the numbers back then and saw it was the go to weapon for silenced+SP or unsilenced+non SP sniping.
                    Imo ump-45 was above other guns. It was good even at long distances. Talking only about HC.
                        You definitely could bink people at range in hardcore with that gun
                    I had that realization looking back. Like marathon/lightweight/commando was STUPID but so was me being able to rapid fire a barret 50 cal with a thermal scope or the lack of recoil on an RPD LMG. The game was FUN albeit chaotic fun

EDIT: Shame on me for not adding One Man Army/Danger Close and Noob tubes.
                    Y’all talking about the TAR and ACR, but the real weapon was the SCAR with FMJ rounds.
                        Big facts
                    I loved the AUG, I actually thought it was the best LMG alongside the RPD.  

I agree though, every gun being fairly strong felt good in that game.
            Called being fun. Balance isnt necessary if all of them are "strong"
        The underbarrel shotgun never got nerfed. Stopping power on it made it a long range shotgun like the models, i coined it the ‘raoul moat’ and moating was born. The whole squad would run a moat class and we kicked some major arse, steady aim made it worse tho. Andy would shout ‘moated’ with every kill. Good times. I miss og mw2.
        Dual mods was INSANE
    If you put the right attachments on the Bryson and squint hard enough, you can get spas vibes at time.
        Ive enjoyed leveling it. Seems to be legit.
        Once you get the 2nd barrel, the one that gives it max range it starts to feel like the spas 12 maybe 50% of the time
            Max range and tighter spread barrel is definitely a game changer
    I dont know why they never brought back a model similar to the Spas-12. All recent pump action shotguns all look like the old fashion boring looking type. Spas-12 looked so modern and just felt better.
        SPAS-12 return with a receiver conversion (or just an on the fly selector like it can IRL) to change between semi-auto and pump action would be super neat and extremely unique. Shotguns in COD have almost always suffered a lack of variety.
    Sandy ravage and the Spas 12 were what first got me into COD
        The SpasTec-130
    Great gun in game, horrible bulky piece of trash in real life.
Unrelated but if we’re going down memory lane. I got my first Nuke on Afghan. It all happened because me and my little brother were messing around in split screen on PS3 and I used my PSN account on split screen and unlocked the Nuke and AC-130 just to use them in a private lobby. 

Fast forward later in the evening, I never changed my killstreaks back because I forgot. Managed to go on a 7 killstreak and had to get like the last two or three kills with sawn off Rangers I picked up from someone.
    Mine was on Wasteland. TAR-21 with underbarrel shotgun lol
        Completely forgot about the old underbarrel shotgun. Such a fun attachment!
    I got my first Nuke on Afghan as well. Ground War and I had my AC-130 up and they were spawning at the top of the cliff where B was. It was an absolute massacre.
    Nukes didn’t need to be equipped on mw2 right?
        They did. My set up was harriers, chopper Gunner, nuke
            That was everybody's setup for nukes I believe :D maybe the AC-130 instead of the chopper, depending on the person
                If you knew how to use the AC-130, that thing absolutely SHREDDED.
                    The AC-130 took more kills to get and rarely got you enough to get the nuke. If you had them spawn camped, the AC-130 was superior. However, if they weren't spawn camped, you wanted the chopper gunner

Source: young me got over 100+ nukes and was absolutely obsessed with it
Yup same here. First chopper on that map with a ACR HB sensor and SPAS-12. You're a man of style I see
    How the hell do y’all remember this? Do I smoke too much weed? Lmao
    Ahh the spastex-130 as it was called back then.

Good times.
Man its the original COD4 and MW2 maps that get me. I long for the "bad" maps even like underpass.
    How dare you! I liked underpass! :D
    Absolutely loved underpass. Just slap a thermal scope on a gun and chill in the grass.
My friends and I used to play dodgeball in one of the wider tunnels in Sub base on 4-way splitscreen. 

Teams of two, line up on opposite sides of the tunnel and then throw throwing knives at each other until one team reaches a certain score.

Man I miss the days of having a group of friends playing split screen around someone's house. It's not the same playing online.
    Haha, my friends and I used to do that too!

Same map, I *think* same place, only we tried to stick each other with semtex. Closest we could get to snowballs lol.
I got a 57 kill streak on it with an acr/grenade launcher, claymores, and scavenger. It was insane. I got a chopper gunner in the first 45 seconds. I wish the xbox 360 had had recording cause I'd love to re-live that.
Solid map.
Sub base with the ACR was my first nuke!
Got my first nuke there
If you didn't come in this thread to talk about Sub Base or Favela idk what else

Easily the most underrated maps in CoD history. Met my lifelong friend in a 1v1 on Sub Base
My friends and i used to party up and go on nuke streaks where we tried to go as many games in a row while getting nukes. I think our max was 6 or 7, but I’ll never forget being in sub base with the game coming  to an end and my buddy popped off with like 2 minutes left to keep our streak alive. Good memories  on that map
UMP-45 suppressed was a beast
A remake with it actively snowing sounds cool. Dunno if it would actually be annoying but worth a try on new console hardware
I remember when I got my first nuke. Got it on High Rise sniping. But my last 6 kills I had to do with a pistol because I was out of ammo for my sniper
I do miss downpour a lot. I feel like a reimagining of a few aspects to the layout would make this a great map.
    My COD4 disc was somehow corrupt and wouldn't play this map. So for a long time until i caved and bought a new copy, every time this map came up in the rotation my party would instantly back out because they knew i would get kicked
        I had to w same issue with firing range on black ops 1 lol
            Hah I don't feel so alone, this happened every time I tried to run ascension, which makes no since because it was dlc
            SAME
        This happened to me with Crossfire lol.
            All of these replies are such banger maps too, I feel bad for you guys haha
        Actually same, this map just never wanted to work. My game was in good condition too. I ended up borrowing a friends copy and downloading it onto my HDD. When that became a feature on Xbox 360
    Agreed, maybe just like adding another door to the dead end field on the side and getting rid of the mounted MG since they don't do those anymore, and it'd be really cool. Loved having rainy maps
    i must’ve been 12/13 when i stayed home from school because i was sick. it was pouring outside, and i was playing cod in my room, on downpour. halfway through the match i just stopped and stared outside for a solid minute watching the rain come down. something about that moment really stuck with me because i remember that moment being really special. i have so many great memories playing mw/mw2.

just wanted to share that
    This was the map that got me hooked
    i miss the giant white void maps, those were classics. running around for eternity and never seeing another player, slowly going insane as i lose perception of what's real and what isn't. wondering if there really ever were any other players to with 


also Estate, that one was a blast haha
    Downpour would be a fantastic realism mode map. Nighttime raining with NVGS
    You’d want to get rid of my Mega Machine Gun ™️ wouldn’t you
I’d like to preface this by saying MW2 is my favorite game of all time.

Please no Derail or Wasteland.

Back then people would still be rushing into the high traffic areas even on huge maps. Nowadays derail would just be people sniping from behind random ass trees on the outskirts of the map and from the buildings. Don’t even want to think about the people who would just lay down in the grass on wasteland.

Sure it happened a bit back then, but it wasn’t whole lobbies like it seems to be now. Ironically even without a combat record, once one person starts camping it seems like the whole lobby puts up their own tents and no one moves.
    Can remember everyone thinking they sneaky as hell crawling through the grass on wasteland , thermal sniper used to destroy them
        Also the way killstreaks were in mw2, you were never really safe out in the grass. You could take cold blooded but you could easily get turned on by someone with stopping power even if you shoot first.
            There was this hut on one side I can remember vividly being in there with my 2 mates , all rocking interventions with thermals and a big stretch of field long grass to get to the hut , the best times
                The days before sniper glint 😔
        I got my first Nuke on Wasteland using the Barrett .50 w/ ACOG. Just playing like an absolute piece of shit
            Lol the Barrett 50 cal was also a lovely rifle to use
    Yeah that's annoying but I wouldn't mind having a map that's great for snipers. Every other map is designed for running around. Give the snipers a map. Mix up the gameplay
        I would agree if ground war / invasion weren’t just roof top sniper simulators already. I feel like I already have my go to place if I want to do longer range sniping. The other maps are good for aggressive sniping already. The MSR (spx-80) is the best feeling actual sniper rifle we’ve had in a mw game since the MSR in mw3 lol
        Taraq exists
            Sure but if were talking about bringing back ALL of these maps like the first comment was saying then there's no point in leaving out 1 map because  of snipers.
                Tbf I think it’s a bizarre wish to have all the maps back. They weren’t *all* that good
        The snipers have two whole modes to themselves
        Play Ground war/Invasion?
    I fucking loved ghillie sniping with coldblooded in Derail and Wasteland
    Derail was fun on hard-core search. Besides the across the map noob tunes. Adding a crane or something could fix that. Blocking the air
    Bog can gtfoh too
    OG MW2 is also my favourite multiplayer FPS of all time. I agree some of these maps may be janky, would love if they just put them in a nostalgia playlist.  


Skidrow, terminal sub base. all amazing maps.
    Thankyou for not some how blaming doors or the fact that this game is new or that you can hear footsteps or any other random ass thing people seem to blame for it being different than it was back then. People just play different now, they have more experience, there are more players, youtube/twitch is a thing, information is more accessible.
Except Bog, Bog is awful for Domination

Personally I hate Estate as every game devolved into "Camp the hell out of the House"

*I notice that a lot of the MW2 maps like Karachi, Derail, and Rundown were exploitable by  OMA Noob Tubes where you could Stand on A launch a Noob Tube in the air and it'll land directly on C
    I loved Bog for domination, well I loved the summer version because I could fucking SEE.
        If you have B and C and the opponent has A  they will mostly spawn behind a walled area with one way to escape and they'll get spawn camped to hell
    Bog was a throwable fest. Grenades, flashbangs, smoke, everything is popping as often as gunfire.
        The full game was a throawble fest everyone ran frag x3
            And martyrdom
nooo leave downturn
    Downturn
DOWNTURN!!!!
    Everyone hates Downturn.
Lol this is how I know this sub has rose tinted glasses. I’ve been playing since CoD4 and a lot of these maps are straight up not good.
Literally all of them. So many good memories on every map; Countdown would be HILARIOUS to see in a modern Call of Duty.
Not enough love here for that map. I feel like it could come back tomorrow and be a competitive map
Why did I have to scroll so low for this lmao 

District was fucking GOATed for search ❤️
    It was so good, I don't even care dying to perfectly thrown lane nades.
Given me memories of how everyone on defensive side would jump down the stairs, throwing grenades over the building, while people on the attacking side would shoot straight through the building from the other side to kill them.

I’d take every one of those COD4 maps back, even if I didn’t like Downpour. No added door or anything however please. Just.. the maps as they were.
SND in Cod4 was just awesome - I can remember some moments from almost every map. District, Pipeline, Overgrown, Broadcast and Downpour especially stand out in my memory for SND, but honestly loved every map
District and Crossfire were both great SnD maps. District was def better, though. I’d also throw Strike in that category…oh and Backlot…

Ok so CoD 4 was just amazing lol.
District and Backlot were the best maps in CoD4 in my opinion. Both let all playstyles play to their liking and didn't have a true power position like most maps do.
I swear everybody slept on district for SND. A man of culture, you are.
Fuck yeah, crossfire was always my favorite.  Strike was definitely up there too.  Used to love bouncing from the sandbags by the statue in the middle to tey and quickscope people over walls lol
Crossfire was a perfect map. Does anyone else remember the physics exploits that would let you camp on the outer walls/leave the map? Wetwork had a good one as well.
    In the old school mode where you could hop all the way out the map lol.
    I played jump mode a lot, crossifre was one of the easier maps to jump out, but easiest was backlot, I was running outside so often in non-jump matches like tdm or sad

Bloc was known for elevators

Pipeline had the easiest big bounce in middle, also very OP in TDM, people just didn't expect you there 

Showdown was very cool for jumpers, but on some spots you needed boost from friend, so not that great in regular matches, but still some nice jumps 

Crash bounce on heli was hard to do in TDM or regular play, not impossible, but also not very useful and didn't get you outside on its own 

Damn I need to find some jump servers with regular maps (not custom) to play again, it was soooo good
Crossfire was my fuckin *jam* in COD4.
The nostalgia hit every time I see a post about CoD4! Is the new MWII actually any good? Stumbled on this post from /r/popular!
    As someone that started really getting into COD with COD2 and COD4, I feel like MWII is a return to the good old days in many ways.
        Could you elaborate? I played scrims with clan mates back in the CoD2 and 4 days and what I miss most is the prominence of single shot rifles like Kar98k etc. I wouldn't think that sort of gameplay would be possible with modern Cod stylings.
Arkaden was my favourite map for infected. Everybody used to use burger town as an outpost lol
    Hiding behind the counter at the burger shop was pretty much a guaranteed top-3 finish on Infected lmao
        That, and behind the escalator corners! Good memories!!
    Omg memories. Hiding behind the counter created intense bonds with your fellow survivors. Everyone had their own spot to cover and friendships were formed without even using voice chat. Until you ran out of ammo and got infected. Then your former brother in arms became your greatest enemy. 🥲
    MW3 Infected was the best version we ever had. So many nukes, or managing to get your specialist bonus and trying to find a hiding spot with 17 infected running around.
    Speaking of infected,why the hell isn’t it in the game now? So many fun memories playing that mode.
    Mannnn that shit used to be so crazy hiding behind the counter dual fmg9s trying to get them first couple kills til that scavenger hit lol ducking knives . Damn them was the days
MW3 had some solid maps tbh. Mission, Arkaden, Underground, Lockdown and Seatown
    Seatown might be my favorite map in CoD. It's so dynamic with all the different routes you can take.  MW3 had some amazing maps, hell the DLC maps were also just as good. I wish more people liked MW3, in general. Everyone just says "it's mediocre" and that's it, but it really isn't.
        MW3’s biggest flaw is that people were getting burnt out by the MW series at that point and it was coming on the heels of Black Ops. People wanted something new and exciting, not a better version of what had come before. 

Imo, by most objective criteria it’s the best MW game of the series. Way more balanced than MW and MW2, tons of content, good maps, competitively viable but fun for casual play. The support killstreaks and specialist perk system were both really good additions, Stopping Power being gone freed up a lot of class creation options, nukes (sorry—MOABs) didn’t end games, it was just a ton of fun to play.
            totally agree with you, MW3 will always have a special place in my heart, I mean it's noy BO2 but I would argue a second place for sure.
            I just wanted more guns and more dlc maps lol
        > the DLC tracts were also just as good

I would kill for them to bring back Sanctuary, Piazza, Black Box, Liberation, Boardwalk, or Foundation - all such great maps
    And resistance the French one. Mw3 was a banger I’ll die on this hill lol. Also sitrep pro for soundwhoring to the max, it even cancelled out dead silence 😂
    I miss mission, village, arkaden etc!
    Bakaara was amazing as well, long sightlines and cool interiors


I also used to hate Lockdown, then one day 
 Wii servers got hacked, and it became the ONLY map in rotation
If they bring back infected… They need to bring Arkaden back.

Best map ever for that mode imo.
phenomenal map
Amazing for infected and all or nothing too
MW2 had some very good DLC maps
    Definitely. I loved trailer park, liked the theme park one (forget the name). There were several other solid ones
        Carnival!!
Trailer park was very very good.
is it back??
    Terminal came back in infinite warfare. Not sure it's coming back in this game
        There's rumours that the big expansion in stead of a new game next year will have every OG MW2 map. See: xclusive ace's video on it.
            A bit bull shit to charge for it when the game launched with almost no maps. I thought the whole point of the cosmetics and battle pass were to farm whales and use them to push out content to keep engagement. Kinda lame to double dip
                I agree the game launched unfinished but this will be at the normal end of the life cycle. If it were vanguard it would only be just out this month. 

I wouldn't say it's double dipping but I do agree that the current state of the game is unacceptable for the price.
                It's just like mw2 days with DLC map packs. Full nostalgia of being a young teen and not being able to afford enough Microsoft points to get the new map pack
        It's confirmed that Terminal map is inside the new Warzone 2 map. So it's just a matter of time for them to use it in MP.
        Quarry, Terminal, Shipment, Afghan and Highrise are all on the Warzone 2 map.

You can find them if you setup a private match on Al Bagra Fortress, allow free cam and go into spectator mode.

    I am still sore from them not releasing Firing Range in Cold War. My favorite COD map of all time!
        I think they thought it was just done too many times. Would have been fun though
            Yet they release nuketown every 3 years without fail
    Such good times on Cold War with the OG maps. I think that because they added OG maps singularly made the game 1000% more fun.
All they need to do is add 30-40 cars that can be exploded and plop them in the centre of all these maps. Perfection.
    If I don’t get a dozen doors in the central building of each map I’m going to cry.
In previous games, they've released throwback maps, and been called lazy for it.

But when they don't do it, they "lack knowledge of their fan base".
The maps would still play completely differently to how they were originally. Take the remastered maps on BO4 for example. Faster movement, new equipment, etc. They might as well have been different maps since they played so differently to the original game
They clearly lack the knowledge of their fan base yet they just released a COD that made $1,000,000,000 in one week? Interesting.
    I would love to know how many people thought this game would 

1. Come with MW2 maps
2. Work reliably and not crash on consoles & pc
3. Come with barracks, leaderboards.

It’s probably extremely high. First week sales are nothing more than their marketing teams success. Maintaining high sales and player count will show that people actually enjoy the game long term.
        Points 2 and 3 are completely valid. I hoped for those as they are base functions of a complete game so they dropped the ball there. I’m just saying it’s funny to say Activision isn’t in touch with their fans. They don’t care! They’re laughing all the way to the bank with a BILLION dollars. They do not care about any of the complaints, or being in touch with the community - we have showed them they don’t have to.
Boy does it hit HARD.
My heart, I absolutely loved Cod4, it was my first game with friends

Now I hear there's a new MW out but I don't have an Xbox anymore and am not used to pc controls.

Apparently it's only like $75 for one and the game for like $30? Idk, but would love to get back
And cod mobile I'm guessing
    Yeah just the main games. Didn't even consider mobile.
        You just dropped a tactical nuke on r/callofdutymobile
            Man those 3 people are going to be pissed
Did they ever bring back Favela? I feel like they haven’t yet
    In Ghosts.
Surprised that wasn't brought back in mw2019
    There were no gun fights in that map. It was just sniping and flanking
        It was a fun map though, Not everyone played like it was life and death like this mw2
            Dude I’ve been thinking this. People don’t play COD like they used to. It wasn’t nearly as big of a deal as people make it now.
                Everyone wants to be a streamer, YouTuber, tiktoker. We have an era of sweats that back then you weren’t competing with other sweats, but with casuals and ping/connection was the way we used to be in a lobby
                    Everyone wanted to be mlg back then and would lie about being sponsored. Thing is we've gotten wayyy better at fps games. Red tiger was hard a fuck to get on controller back then despite being a laughable 150 headshots. I think I remember seeing a single gold camo gun back in mw1 (outside degal ofc) and I played a fuckload. We always tried hard, we just sucked. Everyone just wants to pop off and get a bunch of kills, not much has changed
                I used to hop on, play a few matches, scratch that itch with a couple of snipes. Now, I am constantly reviewing every aspect of the game and how I can improve
                Yeah those old MW and MW2 days were the best. No bunny hops, slides, 1000 sensitivity spin shit.

I used to actually get top of the board back then quite frequently. My skills have defo deteriorated with age but the game has also just turned super sweaty and unrealistic now
                    You telling me you didn’t play with 12 sensitivity and run across the map with a USP and knife and a Intervention?
            True, there was a methodical playstyle to some of those Cod4 maps
        People don’t realize what made these maps all fun is the diversity of play style. Nowadays all maps hit the same criteria and make sure everything is overly consistent
            Remember 15 years ago when only a a small percentage or people had turtle beach head sets and dead silence was optional.
                I had turtle beach, thought it looked so bad ass but was so cheaply made lol
        I feel like it would be a perfect fit for mwii, just needs more clutter inside each building, and 50 feet more of unnecessary space behind each spawn
This was my favourite COD4 map, absolutely loved it
If they added some more cover in the middle I think it would play very nicely while still having a similar feel.
biggest slept on map, it was actually unique
Hell yes. I feel like we're prob in the minority liking this one. Brings back the memories.
Bloc is the best map in COD history, and that’s a hill I’m willing to die on
you my type of guy
I came here looking for this.
Seatown and lockdown. 🔥
Same. Lots of fun on that map
What game did they bring back Dome for? I must have missed that
    Also Ghosts, DLC map remake
(And Strike Zone, base map, had a VERY similar layour)
    It’s likely to be in MW22 anyway, Mount Zaya (Spec Ops mission) is the exact layout.
Besides downturn, MW3 had no bad maps.
    Carbon was an insta skip for me. And maybe everyone because I barely remember playing it, it would always skip. It just had a terrible flow to it, in my opinion.
        MW3 was my first COD game, and seeing all of the maps brought back so many good memories. Then I saw Carbon. I have no memories of Carbon lmao
I liked fallen as well actually.

Seatown and Lockdown were legit!
How is Sea Town not in Al Mazra, such a missed opportunity
Derail 💀

That one can stay down. Although as I've played it since the game has been "dead", it's grown on me
Once it is added to MWII it'll count
    Remind me to comment again next Wednesday **;)**
        why's that? Are they releasing it in the map pool then too?
            I think it’s just conjecture rn but it would be a wildly tone deaf move to not release it. So yeah they probably won’t lmao
Pretty sure there's a couple on the new warzone map. Terminal, highrise, mw3 dome, and quarry like you said
    Showdown is also on Wz 2 map
        Are you serious omggg
            Yeah I think it was in a trailer or some footage they released
            [https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2022/09/call-of-duty-next-warzone-new-era-al-mazrah-map-intel-guide](https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2022/09/call-of-duty-next-warzone-new-era-al-mazrah-map-intel-guide)  
look it up  
"Ahkdar Village" :)
                An old town fit for a showdown 😎
    Dome is one of the areas playable in Spec Ops, it's the defense mission.
    Also Afghan.
Agreed! Good memories on Bootleg, Fallen, Mission, Seatown & Village.
    That game really was a top 5 cod of all time, might even be top 3 for me!
        Honestly, I know it's controversial, but it's my favorite CoD. Very satisfying campaign, way more balanced than MW2, while retaining the speed and fluidity from it that BO1 lacked. Infected was incredible, as was kill confirmed. Extremely fun and dynamic maps. Good times man. I wish more people liked it
            Yeah same. For me it had the best weapon selection and perks in the series. It introduced weapon levelling, score streaks and specialist. Then there was infected, drop zone, juggernaut game modes etc. Man the game was endless fun.
            It’s always amazed me that so many people say MW2 was better. That’s gotta be pure nostalgia speaking, because MW3 was basically the same exact game mechanically but with better maps and better balance.
                The one thing I'll say in MW2's favor is the presentation felt more "video game-y." By that I mean the sound effects and colors were a bit more cartoony and fun, whereas MW3 felt like the more serious older brother with everything being gray and brown and the sounds more muted.
                    Yeah I can see that. MW2 had brighter colors for sure.
                MW 2 is my favorite but it’s also the one I had the most playtime in by far. Had 1500+ hours in it compared to 300-400 in mw3. Pretty much stopped playing COD after that.
            They need to bring back the guitar solos and explosions that happen every time I level up. It’s honestly shocking they don’t try harder to capitalize on that nostalgia. Felt so badass doing basic things
            By far my favourite. Then its BO2. But the gap is pretty big.
                For me it’s 1A. BO2 1B. MW3
        mw1/2/3 & bo1/2 easy top 5 in any order
    I forgot about Fallen. That map was amazing!
I never see anybody talk about Interchange but I LOVED that map. I got my first MOAB on that map
Always has been. CoD4 has been top tier always.

MW2 received a shit ton on flak back then, just as much as modern CoD games have been receiving. It’s just that the squeakers who came into the franchise via MW2 grew up and got a voice on the internet, slowly changing the perception around that game.
    Definitely a hot take but I've never been a huge fan of most cod 4 maps. 

I love things like vacant or overgrown but maps like Bog just turn into an M16 and m40 headglitch fest. 

Some CoD4 maps just feel like a WW1 trench to me and arent fun. 

Obviously I'd rather have something like crossfire over downturn but if Bog never came back I wouldn't be upset.
    I probably played more MWII back in the day, but you're absolutely spot on. COD4 was absolutely fantastic; and whilst MWII was great fun, holy fuck did it have horrendous issues. So many straight up broken perk combinations etc.

It's definitely rose tinted glasses for many; I can't remember being so frustrated at a MP game than I did at MWII back on the 360 - and that was even playing with a load of good friends back when I was in college with no worries.
arkaden slapped fr
Now you’d have to slowly crouch walk to the bomb or make sure nobody hears your “KILL ME PLEASE” alarm your dead silence makes.
Ambush was great on Headquarters too
What a great way to date memories
Loved playing Crossfire, it felt like a good short/medium/long range mix map for every playstyle.
Loved crossfire. Favorite cod4 map by a mile.
    This was the map where after "The Matrix" from zzirGrizz dropped everyone tried to do those ACOG M40A3 360 noscope crossmaps down the middle lane.
The sniper battles I had in Crossfire were \*chef's kiss\*

There was a 24/7  Crossfire server that I frequented. Loved it so much. Same people were on all the time in addition to randoms. I miss dedicated servers.
    I remember that server! Just pure fun.
Crossfire was amazing, seeing that photo brings back some memories
Both incredible maps. I always loved Ambush for SnD. It might be too open for it to be great now though.
I need Crossfire back in my life
I feel like they should add Ambush and just remove Taraq. Taraq feels like the Walmart version of Ambush.
Wasteland is actually a remake map

https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Brecourt_(map)
Thermal WA2000 on wasteland was my first nuke ever
Great kill confirmed map
Bloc and Bog would play so horrifically with this games mechanics it’s not even funny.
    [deleted]
I fucking loved Bloc, sneaking from side to side with an SMG rinsing hard scoped snipers.
I'm i the only one who likes bloc lol
Yes but if we learned anything from mw they will just add areas and doors and buildings that were normally inaccessible to these maps to "reflect the changes in the franchise"
These maps are full of those things lol did you play them?
    lots of them definitely are. Karachi, Derail, Invasion, Rundown, even Sub base. Thats why the top comment is saying they got killstreaks hiding around with a heartbeat sensor and shotgun on sub base, lol

Skidrow and Highrise would be the best maps to bring back, i think.
Miss that long corridor at the top of the stairs :(
I loved Derail.
Erosion could comeback as a 6v6 map and people would love it
ALL the maps\*
Honestly the maps aren't even bad comparing them to 2019 they are quite good on obj modes. Absolutely dreadful tdm and ffa maps tho
It does bring up memories.
That's a good question of the best ever.
It returned in MW3 & IW. Sub Base would be good, the game needs a snow map.
    Derail really needs to make a comeback.
    What about High Rise?
        Returned in AW.
It was a CoD4 base map but returned in MW2.
Agreed.
MW2 for Overgrown. It hasn't returned since though. It's due a return. Yeah some spots on Crossfire were mental.
I think so too.
Fuck man looking at these maps has brought back so many memories, back in the day I was a heavy survival is better than Zombies guy, I’m going to look for my copy of MW3 when I get home from work and play some survival mode

Edit: Fuck, old school spec ops! I need to find that disc ASAP
Crossfire? Really?
    Crossfire was amazing, that said sniping back then was more challenging.
    LOL yeah them buses were great to catch anyone off-guard..
Black ops 1 had a similar layout map called Havana. It had the same sort of Z structure.
CoD4 remastered? I excluded that game however.
    Maybe! I can’t remember where I’ve played it again but i feel like I have lol
        It was on Mobile.
MW2 has a fantastic variety of maps. It's what this game is really lacking.
I remember doing that for camos
I loved that map. The only reason I bought the CoD4 map pack is because I thought that map looked cool.
Nostalgia.
Yes, it returned in AW.
Ok when you port over the old map, do some minor changes to the walls so they are taller/ have clutter and can’t be vaulted. Surely small changes like this are much quicker than creating entirely new maps??
That just makes it more hectic and fun!
They just change the height of the walls like they did in Backlot and Crash from MW19. There are plenty of ways to avoid these issues
Games have been $60 for nearly 20 years. I do not know why people think inflation shouldn't apply to games
Remade in Ghosts
Remade in Ghosts
Probably cos the new games are fucking shit by comparison lol
Overgrown was originally CoD4. Favela was in Ghosts. Afghan was in IW.
Afghan was remade in IW. I wasn't expecting Wasteland to get three thumbs up!
    > I wasn't expecting Wasteland to get three thumbs up!

It's actually a remake

https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Brecourt_(map)
        Wow I had no idea
These Maps are 100x better than the new ones.
Modern Warfare 3 & Infinite Warfare
    Mw3 is classed as OG since it was the original modern warfare. Never knew about IW though
        Yeah they updated it to be more Space-y, but it was only a graphics change.
        Yeah I didn't include maps if they returned in MW2 or MW3 either. The only 2 that fit that criteria are Overgrown & Strike from CoD4 which have only returned in MW2.
They brought it back on MW3 and Infinite Warfare
Terminal was in Infinite Warfare :)
[deleted]
Search and destroy on Derail was so good
I agree but I doubt it'll happen; the entire community was in outrage because Miami was slightly dark and Cartel had bushes they couldn't see through

Seems like a majority of the community just wants easy three lane sight lines, at least the vocal part of the community
Wild the models got nerfed to oblivion and that gun was left to reign supreme the whole time 😂
    And it was a damn secondary lmao. Crazy how in mw2 most of the secondary's could compete with the primaries and there wasn't any drawback to them at all lol
        Mw2 was not a balanced game but man it was fun
            I mean if everything was OP, didn't that really make nothing OP?

Outside of the early 1887's, there really wasn't any gun that was far above or below the rest from what I remember, outside of the AUG specifically being a bit weak maybe?
                I want my TAR back
                    And ACR
                        yeah i loved the acr. NGL with heartbeat attached ofc
                            All it needs is a red dot sight :) loved those iron sights too
                        MP5, Spas-12 combo. The Sandy Ravage special.
                        Acr goated for real i just want it back
                    The ram-7 did okay at being a replacement but just not the same
                    The TAR was by far my favorite weapon in multiplayer. I’m convinced they gave it good iron sights because the devs knew that the red dot was damn ugly
                    Yeah I miss that gun
                There was something about the UMP45 that made it busted. It's been 13 years, so details are hazy, but I think it was that the regular suppressor penalties didn't apply to the UMP45, and it naturally had very low recoil with the muzzle flash removed by the suppressor, so that made it an all-round gun that could fill any role and was a menace in the right hands. It wasn't anywhere near as famous of an exploit as One Man Army and such, so it wasn't a plague on the game. Just one of those things where skilled players knew to watch out for the guy rocking a suppressed UMP45, because that player knew what was up and was definitely trying for high killstreaks.
                    Silenced UMP45 and Akimbo Rangers all. damn. day!
                        That was my go to setup to attempt to drop a nuke. Fond memories of running absolutely rampant in Favela.
                    It could double as an assault rifle because of it's crazy range, good damage, fire rate and low recoil. But the fact that it was an SMG meant you could also Rush with it. Really was a Swiss Army Knife as far as durability, and depending on the routes you navigate Multi-player maps with, Usually outclassed anything you'd come across. UMP+Spas-12 in the right hands was untouchable
                    I also remember the boost it got from stopping power was almost useless so it was the perfect smg to run with ghost
                    Yup and you could speed up the fire rate I use to run wild with it!!! Thanks for the memory lane my man!!!!
                One man army noob tubes, commando pro, and painkiller deathstreak are the main things I remember being bullshit in that game
                    Even better in mw3 we had death mans hand as a death streak. For those fortunate enough to not have encountered such nightmare, instead of dying you entered a “final stand” stance and had a c4 remote at hand. You then roleplayed as a suicide bomber, but for some reason they gave you a pocket nuke. That shit had about a 15m radius for no reason and it always one shot no matter how far you were
                    Holy shit I forgot all about the death streaks
                        [deleted]
                            Martyrdom and final stand. So basically the annoying "revenge" perks they got rid of from cod4
                        Holy shit I forgot all about wrecking shop with nothing but a knife and commando pro
                IIRC the WA2000 was basically a hybrid of the disadvantages of the Intervention/Barrett (low mobility, slow ADS) with the disadvantages of the M14 (lower damage). There wasn't really a point in running it, ever.

And the whole LMG class suffered from the same problem it has suffered ever since: Not mobile enough to actually move around, and not powerful enough to camp. The RPD and MG4 were somewhat viable, but I remember the L86/AUG/M240 to be pretty shite.

And I do remember the F2000 to be pretty bad with low damage and bad recoil, but I might be misremembering that.
                    >IIRC the WA2000 was basically a hybrid of the disadvantages of the Intervention/Barrett (low mobility, slow ADS) with the disadvantages of the M14 (lower damage). There wasn't really a point in running it, ever.

It was a troll weapon. Nothing like outsniping some kids in Search with the WA and every time they see their kill cam they gotta see the smiley face sticker on the scope cover

And even then it wasn't an awful gun by any means, just was far and away the worst option for snipers. Was still a 1 shot for head, neck and chest IIRC unless you put a silencer on it
                        Yeah, certainly. In other CoDs it would probably have been considered decent, in MW2 it was not only the worst option in it's class by considerable margin, it was also outclassed by the FAL with an ACOG (or thermal scope, don't remember). I guess that fits OPs bill of a gun that was far below the rest.

But honestly I think that because there was no point in playing guns you didn't want meant that you never felt being at a disadvantage. You were never forced into unfair engagements because you needed to grind a gun to unlock something for a different gun. And since the default classes already gave you a FAMAS+SPAS, an UMP or a Barrett you were pretty much settled from the get go.
                        A bit late but actually it was the sniper rifle that didn't suffer at all with a silencer, provided you were running stopping power as usual. For example silencing the Barrett/Intervention brought their 1HKO from head+chest+stomach to head+chest. 

WA2000 was head+chest by default so the idea was to either silence it and use stopping power, or use it unsilenced without stopping power. If you were using it unsilenced with stopping power then yeah it was straight up trolling and worse than other options.

I found the latter pretty nice with cold blooded pro on the open sniping maps since people would scan for red names and killstreaks would sit in the sky 24/7.
                    The WA2000 definitely wasn't outstanding and required a pretty unique sniping playstyle, but it was far from a poor weapon and was at least on par with the Barrett if not better in the right hands. It was also the only semi auto actually viable for quick scoping and I remember seeing more than one really good player absolutely  wreck with it (it was just far less forgiving than just using the intervention, and like someone mentioned below, ironically outclassed by most things with an ACOG)

I disagree about the LMGs. The AUG and L86 definitely just felt like crappy assault rifles and didn't see much use, but the RPD, M240, and MG4 were very common and incredibly effective in Domination and Headquarters among hard objective players
                        The WA2000 was nice for anyone who crunched the numbers back then and saw it was the go to weapon for silenced+SP or unsilenced+non SP sniping.
                Imo ump-45 was above other guns. It was good even at long distances. Talking only about HC.
                    You definitely could bink people at range in hardcore with that gun
                I had that realization looking back. Like marathon/lightweight/commando was STUPID but so was me being able to rapid fire a barret 50 cal with a thermal scope or the lack of recoil on an RPD LMG. The game was FUN albeit chaotic fun

EDIT: Shame on me for not adding One Man Army/Danger Close and Noob tubes.
                Y’all talking about the TAR and ACR, but the real weapon was the SCAR with FMJ rounds.
                    Big facts
                I loved the AUG, I actually thought it was the best LMG alongside the RPD.  

I agree though, every gun being fairly strong felt good in that game.
        Called being fun. Balance isnt necessary if all of them are "strong"
    The underbarrel shotgun never got nerfed. Stopping power on it made it a long range shotgun like the models, i coined it the ‘raoul moat’ and moating was born. The whole squad would run a moat class and we kicked some major arse, steady aim made it worse tho. Andy would shout ‘moated’ with every kill. Good times. I miss og mw2.
    Dual mods was INSANE
If you put the right attachments on the Bryson and squint hard enough, you can get spas vibes at time.
    Ive enjoyed leveling it. Seems to be legit.
    Once you get the 2nd barrel, the one that gives it max range it starts to feel like the spas 12 maybe 50% of the time
        Max range and tighter spread barrel is definitely a game changer
I dont know why they never brought back a model similar to the Spas-12. All recent pump action shotguns all look like the old fashion boring looking type. Spas-12 looked so modern and just felt better.
    SPAS-12 return with a receiver conversion (or just an on the fly selector like it can IRL) to change between semi-auto and pump action would be super neat and extremely unique. Shotguns in COD have almost always suffered a lack of variety.
Sandy ravage and the Spas 12 were what first got me into COD
    The SpasTec-130
Great gun in game, horrible bulky piece of trash in real life.
Mine was on Wasteland. TAR-21 with underbarrel shotgun lol
    Completely forgot about the old underbarrel shotgun. Such a fun attachment!
I got my first Nuke on Afghan as well. Ground War and I had my AC-130 up and they were spawning at the top of the cliff where B was. It was an absolute massacre.
Nukes didn’t need to be equipped on mw2 right?
    They did. My set up was harriers, chopper Gunner, nuke
        That was everybody's setup for nukes I believe :D maybe the AC-130 instead of the chopper, depending on the person
            If you knew how to use the AC-130, that thing absolutely SHREDDED.
                The AC-130 took more kills to get and rarely got you enough to get the nuke. If you had them spawn camped, the AC-130 was superior. However, if they weren't spawn camped, you wanted the chopper gunner

Source: young me got over 100+ nukes and was absolutely obsessed with it
How the hell do y’all remember this? Do I smoke too much weed? Lmao
Ahh the spastex-130 as it was called back then.

Good times.
How dare you! I liked underpass! :D
Absolutely loved underpass. Just slap a thermal scope on a gun and chill in the grass.
Haha, my friends and I used to do that too!

Same map, I *think* same place, only we tried to stick each other with semtex. Closest we could get to snowballs lol.
My COD4 disc was somehow corrupt and wouldn't play this map. So for a long time until i caved and bought a new copy, every time this map came up in the rotation my party would instantly back out because they knew i would get kicked
    I had to w same issue with firing range on black ops 1 lol
        Hah I don't feel so alone, this happened every time I tried to run ascension, which makes no since because it was dlc
        SAME
    This happened to me with Crossfire lol.
        All of these replies are such banger maps too, I feel bad for you guys haha
    Actually same, this map just never wanted to work. My game was in good condition too. I ended up borrowing a friends copy and downloading it onto my HDD. When that became a feature on Xbox 360
Agreed, maybe just like adding another door to the dead end field on the side and getting rid of the mounted MG since they don't do those anymore, and it'd be really cool. Loved having rainy maps
i must’ve been 12/13 when i stayed home from school because i was sick. it was pouring outside, and i was playing cod in my room, on downpour. halfway through the match i just stopped and stared outside for a solid minute watching the rain come down. something about that moment really stuck with me because i remember that moment being really special. i have so many great memories playing mw/mw2.

just wanted to share that
This was the map that got me hooked
i miss the giant white void maps, those were classics. running around for eternity and never seeing another player, slowly going insane as i lose perception of what's real and what isn't. wondering if there really ever were any other players to with 


also Estate, that one was a blast haha
Downpour would be a fantastic realism mode map. Nighttime raining with NVGS
You’d want to get rid of my Mega Machine Gun ™️ wouldn’t you
Can remember everyone thinking they sneaky as hell crawling through the grass on wasteland , thermal sniper used to destroy them
    Also the way killstreaks were in mw2, you were never really safe out in the grass. You could take cold blooded but you could easily get turned on by someone with stopping power even if you shoot first.
        There was this hut on one side I can remember vividly being in there with my 2 mates , all rocking interventions with thermals and a big stretch of field long grass to get to the hut , the best times
            The days before sniper glint 😔
    I got my first Nuke on Wasteland using the Barrett .50 w/ ACOG. Just playing like an absolute piece of shit
        Lol the Barrett 50 cal was also a lovely rifle to use
Yeah that's annoying but I wouldn't mind having a map that's great for snipers. Every other map is designed for running around. Give the snipers a map. Mix up the gameplay
    I would agree if ground war / invasion weren’t just roof top sniper simulators already. I feel like I already have my go to place if I want to do longer range sniping. The other maps are good for aggressive sniping already. The MSR (spx-80) is the best feeling actual sniper rifle we’ve had in a mw game since the MSR in mw3 lol
    Taraq exists
        Sure but if were talking about bringing back ALL of these maps like the first comment was saying then there's no point in leaving out 1 map because  of snipers.
            Tbf I think it’s a bizarre wish to have all the maps back. They weren’t *all* that good
    The snipers have two whole modes to themselves
    Play Ground war/Invasion?
I fucking loved ghillie sniping with coldblooded in Derail and Wasteland
Derail was fun on hard-core search. Besides the across the map noob tunes. Adding a crane or something could fix that. Blocking the air
Bog can gtfoh too
OG MW2 is also my favourite multiplayer FPS of all time. I agree some of these maps may be janky, would love if they just put them in a nostalgia playlist.  


Skidrow, terminal sub base. all amazing maps.
Thankyou for not some how blaming doors or the fact that this game is new or that you can hear footsteps or any other random ass thing people seem to blame for it being different than it was back then. People just play different now, they have more experience, there are more players, youtube/twitch is a thing, information is more accessible.
I loved Bog for domination, well I loved the summer version because I could fucking SEE.
    If you have B and C and the opponent has A  they will mostly spawn behind a walled area with one way to escape and they'll get spawn camped to hell
Bog was a throwable fest. Grenades, flashbangs, smoke, everything is popping as often as gunfire.
    The full game was a throawble fest everyone ran frag x3
        And martyrdom
Downturn
DOWNTURN!!!!
Everyone hates Downturn.
It was so good, I don't even care dying to perfectly thrown lane nades.
In the old school mode where you could hop all the way out the map lol.
I played jump mode a lot, crossifre was one of the easier maps to jump out, but easiest was backlot, I was running outside so often in non-jump matches like tdm or sad

Bloc was known for elevators

Pipeline had the easiest big bounce in middle, also very OP in TDM, people just didn't expect you there 

Showdown was very cool for jumpers, but on some spots you needed boost from friend, so not that great in regular matches, but still some nice jumps 

Crash bounce on heli was hard to do in TDM or regular play, not impossible, but also not very useful and didn't get you outside on its own 

Damn I need to find some jump servers with regular maps (not custom) to play again, it was soooo good
As someone that started really getting into COD with COD2 and COD4, I feel like MWII is a return to the good old days in many ways.
    Could you elaborate? I played scrims with clan mates back in the CoD2 and 4 days and what I miss most is the prominence of single shot rifles like Kar98k etc. I wouldn't think that sort of gameplay would be possible with modern Cod stylings.
Hiding behind the counter at the burger shop was pretty much a guaranteed top-3 finish on Infected lmao
    That, and behind the escalator corners! Good memories!!
Omg memories. Hiding behind the counter created intense bonds with your fellow survivors. Everyone had their own spot to cover and friendships were formed without even using voice chat. Until you ran out of ammo and got infected. Then your former brother in arms became your greatest enemy. 🥲
MW3 Infected was the best version we ever had. So many nukes, or managing to get your specialist bonus and trying to find a hiding spot with 17 infected running around.
Speaking of infected,why the hell isn’t it in the game now? So many fun memories playing that mode.
Mannnn that shit used to be so crazy hiding behind the counter dual fmg9s trying to get them first couple kills til that scavenger hit lol ducking knives . Damn them was the days
Seatown might be my favorite map in CoD. It's so dynamic with all the different routes you can take.  MW3 had some amazing maps, hell the DLC maps were also just as good. I wish more people liked MW3, in general. Everyone just says "it's mediocre" and that's it, but it really isn't.
    MW3’s biggest flaw is that people were getting burnt out by the MW series at that point and it was coming on the heels of Black Ops. People wanted something new and exciting, not a better version of what had come before. 

Imo, by most objective criteria it’s the best MW game of the series. Way more balanced than MW and MW2, tons of content, good maps, competitively viable but fun for casual play. The support killstreaks and specialist perk system were both really good additions, Stopping Power being gone freed up a lot of class creation options, nukes (sorry—MOABs) didn’t end games, it was just a ton of fun to play.
        totally agree with you, MW3 will always have a special place in my heart, I mean it's noy BO2 but I would argue a second place for sure.
        I just wanted more guns and more dlc maps lol
    > the DLC tracts were also just as good

I would kill for them to bring back Sanctuary, Piazza, Black Box, Liberation, Boardwalk, or Foundation - all such great maps
And resistance the French one. Mw3 was a banger I’ll die on this hill lol. Also sitrep pro for soundwhoring to the max, it even cancelled out dead silence 😂
I miss mission, village, arkaden etc!
Bakaara was amazing as well, long sightlines and cool interiors


I also used to hate Lockdown, then one day 
 Wii servers got hacked, and it became the ONLY map in rotation
Definitely. I loved trailer park, liked the theme park one (forget the name). There were several other solid ones
    Carnival!!
Terminal came back in infinite warfare. Not sure it's coming back in this game
    There's rumours that the big expansion in stead of a new game next year will have every OG MW2 map. See: xclusive ace's video on it.
        A bit bull shit to charge for it when the game launched with almost no maps. I thought the whole point of the cosmetics and battle pass were to farm whales and use them to push out content to keep engagement. Kinda lame to double dip
            I agree the game launched unfinished but this will be at the normal end of the life cycle. If it were vanguard it would only be just out this month. 

I wouldn't say it's double dipping but I do agree that the current state of the game is unacceptable for the price.
            It's just like mw2 days with DLC map packs. Full nostalgia of being a young teen and not being able to afford enough Microsoft points to get the new map pack
    It's confirmed that Terminal map is inside the new Warzone 2 map. So it's just a matter of time for them to use it in MP.
    Quarry, Terminal, Shipment, Afghan and Highrise are all on the Warzone 2 map.

You can find them if you setup a private match on Al Bagra Fortress, allow free cam and go into spectator mode.
I am still sore from them not releasing Firing Range in Cold War. My favorite COD map of all time!
    I think they thought it was just done too many times. Would have been fun though
        Yet they release nuketown every 3 years without fail
Such good times on Cold War with the OG maps. I think that because they added OG maps singularly made the game 1000% more fun.
If I don’t get a dozen doors in the central building of each map I’m going to cry.
I would love to know how many people thought this game would 

1. Come with MW2 maps
2. Work reliably and not crash on consoles & pc
3. Come with barracks, leaderboards.

It’s probably extremely high. First week sales are nothing more than their marketing teams success. Maintaining high sales and player count will show that people actually enjoy the game long term.
    Points 2 and 3 are completely valid. I hoped for those as they are base functions of a complete game so they dropped the ball there. I’m just saying it’s funny to say Activision isn’t in touch with their fans. They don’t care! They’re laughing all the way to the bank with a BILLION dollars. They do not care about any of the complaints, or being in touch with the community - we have showed them they don’t have to.
Yeah just the main games. Didn't even consider mobile.
    You just dropped a tactical nuke on r/callofdutymobile
        Man those 3 people are going to be pissed
In Ghosts.
There were no gun fights in that map. It was just sniping and flanking
    It was a fun map though, Not everyone played like it was life and death like this mw2
        Dude I’ve been thinking this. People don’t play COD like they used to. It wasn’t nearly as big of a deal as people make it now.
            Everyone wants to be a streamer, YouTuber, tiktoker. We have an era of sweats that back then you weren’t competing with other sweats, but with casuals and ping/connection was the way we used to be in a lobby
                Everyone wanted to be mlg back then and would lie about being sponsored. Thing is we've gotten wayyy better at fps games. Red tiger was hard a fuck to get on controller back then despite being a laughable 150 headshots. I think I remember seeing a single gold camo gun back in mw1 (outside degal ofc) and I played a fuckload. We always tried hard, we just sucked. Everyone just wants to pop off and get a bunch of kills, not much has changed
            I used to hop on, play a few matches, scratch that itch with a couple of snipes. Now, I am constantly reviewing every aspect of the game and how I can improve
            Yeah those old MW and MW2 days were the best. No bunny hops, slides, 1000 sensitivity spin shit.

I used to actually get top of the board back then quite frequently. My skills have defo deteriorated with age but the game has also just turned super sweaty and unrealistic now
                You telling me you didn’t play with 12 sensitivity and run across the map with a USP and knife and a Intervention?
        True, there was a methodical playstyle to some of those Cod4 maps
    People don’t realize what made these maps all fun is the diversity of play style. Nowadays all maps hit the same criteria and make sure everything is overly consistent
        Remember 15 years ago when only a a small percentage or people had turtle beach head sets and dead silence was optional.
            I had turtle beach, thought it looked so bad ass but was so cheaply made lol
    I feel like it would be a perfect fit for mwii, just needs more clutter inside each building, and 50 feet more of unnecessary space behind each spawn
Also Ghosts, DLC map remake
(And Strike Zone, base map, had a VERY similar layour)
It’s likely to be in MW22 anyway, Mount Zaya (Spec Ops mission) is the exact layout.
Carbon was an insta skip for me. And maybe everyone because I barely remember playing it, it would always skip. It just had a terrible flow to it, in my opinion.
    MW3 was my first COD game, and seeing all of the maps brought back so many good memories. Then I saw Carbon. I have no memories of Carbon lmao
Remind me to comment again next Wednesday **;)**
    why's that? Are they releasing it in the map pool then too?
        I think it’s just conjecture rn but it would be a wildly tone deaf move to not release it. So yeah they probably won’t lmao
Showdown is also on Wz 2 map
    Are you serious omggg
        Yeah I think it was in a trailer or some footage they released
        [https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2022/09/call-of-duty-next-warzone-new-era-al-mazrah-map-intel-guide](https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2022/09/call-of-duty-next-warzone-new-era-al-mazrah-map-intel-guide)  
look it up  
"Ahkdar Village" :)
            An old town fit for a showdown 😎
Dome is one of the areas playable in Spec Ops, it's the defense mission.
Also Afghan.
That game really was a top 5 cod of all time, might even be top 3 for me!
    Honestly, I know it's controversial, but it's my favorite CoD. Very satisfying campaign, way more balanced than MW2, while retaining the speed and fluidity from it that BO1 lacked. Infected was incredible, as was kill confirmed. Extremely fun and dynamic maps. Good times man. I wish more people liked it
        Yeah same. For me it had the best weapon selection and perks in the series. It introduced weapon levelling, score streaks and specialist. Then there was infected, drop zone, juggernaut game modes etc. Man the game was endless fun.
        It’s always amazed me that so many people say MW2 was better. That’s gotta be pure nostalgia speaking, because MW3 was basically the same exact game mechanically but with better maps and better balance.
            The one thing I'll say in MW2's favor is the presentation felt more "video game-y." By that I mean the sound effects and colors were a bit more cartoony and fun, whereas MW3 felt like the more serious older brother with everything being gray and brown and the sounds more muted.
                Yeah I can see that. MW2 had brighter colors for sure.
            MW 2 is my favorite but it’s also the one I had the most playtime in by far. Had 1500+ hours in it compared to 300-400 in mw3. Pretty much stopped playing COD after that.
        They need to bring back the guitar solos and explosions that happen every time I level up. It’s honestly shocking they don’t try harder to capitalize on that nostalgia. Felt so badass doing basic things
        By far my favourite. Then its BO2. But the gap is pretty big.
            For me it’s 1A. BO2 1B. MW3
    mw1/2/3 & bo1/2 easy top 5 in any order
I forgot about Fallen. That map was amazing!
Definitely a hot take but I've never been a huge fan of most cod 4 maps. 

I love things like vacant or overgrown but maps like Bog just turn into an M16 and m40 headglitch fest. 

Some CoD4 maps just feel like a WW1 trench to me and arent fun. 

Obviously I'd rather have something like crossfire over downturn but if Bog never came back I wouldn't be upset.
I probably played more MWII back in the day, but you're absolutely spot on. COD4 was absolutely fantastic; and whilst MWII was great fun, holy fuck did it have horrendous issues. So many straight up broken perk combinations etc.

It's definitely rose tinted glasses for many; I can't remember being so frustrated at a MP game than I did at MWII back on the 360 - and that was even playing with a load of good friends back when I was in college with no worries.
This was the map where after "The Matrix" from zzirGrizz dropped everyone tried to do those ACOG M40A3 360 noscope crossmaps down the middle lane.
I remember that server! Just pure fun.
[deleted]
lots of them definitely are. Karachi, Derail, Invasion, Rundown, even Sub base. Thats why the top comment is saying they got killstreaks hiding around with a heartbeat sensor and shotgun on sub base, lol

Skidrow and Highrise would be the best maps to bring back, i think.
Derail really needs to make a comeback.
What about High Rise?
    Returned in AW.
Crossfire was amazing, that said sniping back then was more challenging.
LOL yeah them buses were great to catch anyone off-guard..
Maybe! I can’t remember where I’ve played it again but i feel like I have lol
    It was on Mobile.
> I wasn't expecting Wasteland to get three thumbs up!

It's actually a remake

https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Brecourt_(map)
    Wow I had no idea
Mw3 is classed as OG since it was the original modern warfare. Never knew about IW though
    Yeah they updated it to be more Space-y, but it was only a graphics change.
    Yeah I didn't include maps if they returned in MW2 or MW3 either. The only 2 that fit that criteria are Overgrown & Strike from CoD4 which have only returned in MW2.
And it was a damn secondary lmao. Crazy how in mw2 most of the secondary's could compete with the primaries and there wasn't any drawback to them at all lol
    Mw2 was not a balanced game but man it was fun
        I mean if everything was OP, didn't that really make nothing OP?

Outside of the early 1887's, there really wasn't any gun that was far above or below the rest from what I remember, outside of the AUG specifically being a bit weak maybe?
            I want my TAR back
                And ACR
                    yeah i loved the acr. NGL with heartbeat attached ofc
                        All it needs is a red dot sight :) loved those iron sights too
                    MP5, Spas-12 combo. The Sandy Ravage special.
                    Acr goated for real i just want it back
                The ram-7 did okay at being a replacement but just not the same
                The TAR was by far my favorite weapon in multiplayer. I’m convinced they gave it good iron sights because the devs knew that the red dot was damn ugly
                Yeah I miss that gun
            There was something about the UMP45 that made it busted. It's been 13 years, so details are hazy, but I think it was that the regular suppressor penalties didn't apply to the UMP45, and it naturally had very low recoil with the muzzle flash removed by the suppressor, so that made it an all-round gun that could fill any role and was a menace in the right hands. It wasn't anywhere near as famous of an exploit as One Man Army and such, so it wasn't a plague on the game. Just one of those things where skilled players knew to watch out for the guy rocking a suppressed UMP45, because that player knew what was up and was definitely trying for high killstreaks.
                Silenced UMP45 and Akimbo Rangers all. damn. day!
                    That was my go to setup to attempt to drop a nuke. Fond memories of running absolutely rampant in Favela.
                It could double as an assault rifle because of it's crazy range, good damage, fire rate and low recoil. But the fact that it was an SMG meant you could also Rush with it. Really was a Swiss Army Knife as far as durability, and depending on the routes you navigate Multi-player maps with, Usually outclassed anything you'd come across. UMP+Spas-12 in the right hands was untouchable
                I also remember the boost it got from stopping power was almost useless so it was the perfect smg to run with ghost
                Yup and you could speed up the fire rate I use to run wild with it!!! Thanks for the memory lane my man!!!!
            One man army noob tubes, commando pro, and painkiller deathstreak are the main things I remember being bullshit in that game
                Even better in mw3 we had death mans hand as a death streak. For those fortunate enough to not have encountered such nightmare, instead of dying you entered a “final stand” stance and had a c4 remote at hand. You then roleplayed as a suicide bomber, but for some reason they gave you a pocket nuke. That shit had about a 15m radius for no reason and it always one shot no matter how far you were
                Holy shit I forgot all about the death streaks
                    [deleted]
                        Martyrdom and final stand. So basically the annoying "revenge" perks they got rid of from cod4
                    Holy shit I forgot all about wrecking shop with nothing but a knife and commando pro
            IIRC the WA2000 was basically a hybrid of the disadvantages of the Intervention/Barrett (low mobility, slow ADS) with the disadvantages of the M14 (lower damage). There wasn't really a point in running it, ever.

And the whole LMG class suffered from the same problem it has suffered ever since: Not mobile enough to actually move around, and not powerful enough to camp. The RPD and MG4 were somewhat viable, but I remember the L86/AUG/M240 to be pretty shite.

And I do remember the F2000 to be pretty bad with low damage and bad recoil, but I might be misremembering that.
                >IIRC the WA2000 was basically a hybrid of the disadvantages of the Intervention/Barrett (low mobility, slow ADS) with the disadvantages of the M14 (lower damage). There wasn't really a point in running it, ever.

It was a troll weapon. Nothing like outsniping some kids in Search with the WA and every time they see their kill cam they gotta see the smiley face sticker on the scope cover

And even then it wasn't an awful gun by any means, just was far and away the worst option for snipers. Was still a 1 shot for head, neck and chest IIRC unless you put a silencer on it
                    Yeah, certainly. In other CoDs it would probably have been considered decent, in MW2 it was not only the worst option in it's class by considerable margin, it was also outclassed by the FAL with an ACOG (or thermal scope, don't remember). I guess that fits OPs bill of a gun that was far below the rest.

But honestly I think that because there was no point in playing guns you didn't want meant that you never felt being at a disadvantage. You were never forced into unfair engagements because you needed to grind a gun to unlock something for a different gun. And since the default classes already gave you a FAMAS+SPAS, an UMP or a Barrett you were pretty much settled from the get go.
                    A bit late but actually it was the sniper rifle that didn't suffer at all with a silencer, provided you were running stopping power as usual. For example silencing the Barrett/Intervention brought their 1HKO from head+chest+stomach to head+chest. 

WA2000 was head+chest by default so the idea was to either silence it and use stopping power, or use it unsilenced without stopping power. If you were using it unsilenced with stopping power then yeah it was straight up trolling and worse than other options.

I found the latter pretty nice with cold blooded pro on the open sniping maps since people would scan for red names and killstreaks would sit in the sky 24/7.
                The WA2000 definitely wasn't outstanding and required a pretty unique sniping playstyle, but it was far from a poor weapon and was at least on par with the Barrett if not better in the right hands. It was also the only semi auto actually viable for quick scoping and I remember seeing more than one really good player absolutely  wreck with it (it was just far less forgiving than just using the intervention, and like someone mentioned below, ironically outclassed by most things with an ACOG)

I disagree about the LMGs. The AUG and L86 definitely just felt like crappy assault rifles and didn't see much use, but the RPD, M240, and MG4 were very common and incredibly effective in Domination and Headquarters among hard objective players
                    The WA2000 was nice for anyone who crunched the numbers back then and saw it was the go to weapon for silenced+SP or unsilenced+non SP sniping.
            Imo ump-45 was above other guns. It was good even at long distances. Talking only about HC.
                You definitely could bink people at range in hardcore with that gun
            I had that realization looking back. Like marathon/lightweight/commando was STUPID but so was me being able to rapid fire a barret 50 cal with a thermal scope or the lack of recoil on an RPD LMG. The game was FUN albeit chaotic fun

EDIT: Shame on me for not adding One Man Army/Danger Close and Noob tubes.
            Y’all talking about the TAR and ACR, but the real weapon was the SCAR with FMJ rounds.
                Big facts
            I loved the AUG, I actually thought it was the best LMG alongside the RPD.  

I agree though, every gun being fairly strong felt good in that game.
    Called being fun. Balance isnt necessary if all of them are "strong"
The underbarrel shotgun never got nerfed. Stopping power on it made it a long range shotgun like the models, i coined it the ‘raoul moat’ and moating was born. The whole squad would run a moat class and we kicked some major arse, steady aim made it worse tho. Andy would shout ‘moated’ with every kill. Good times. I miss og mw2.
Dual mods was INSANE
Ive enjoyed leveling it. Seems to be legit.
Once you get the 2nd barrel, the one that gives it max range it starts to feel like the spas 12 maybe 50% of the time
    Max range and tighter spread barrel is definitely a game changer
SPAS-12 return with a receiver conversion (or just an on the fly selector like it can IRL) to change between semi-auto and pump action would be super neat and extremely unique. Shotguns in COD have almost always suffered a lack of variety.
The SpasTec-130
Completely forgot about the old underbarrel shotgun. Such a fun attachment!
They did. My set up was harriers, chopper Gunner, nuke
    That was everybody's setup for nukes I believe :D maybe the AC-130 instead of the chopper, depending on the person
        If you knew how to use the AC-130, that thing absolutely SHREDDED.
            The AC-130 took more kills to get and rarely got you enough to get the nuke. If you had them spawn camped, the AC-130 was superior. However, if they weren't spawn camped, you wanted the chopper gunner

Source: young me got over 100+ nukes and was absolutely obsessed with it
I had to w same issue with firing range on black ops 1 lol
    Hah I don't feel so alone, this happened every time I tried to run ascension, which makes no since because it was dlc
    SAME
This happened to me with Crossfire lol.
    All of these replies are such banger maps too, I feel bad for you guys haha
Actually same, this map just never wanted to work. My game was in good condition too. I ended up borrowing a friends copy and downloading it onto my HDD. When that became a feature on Xbox 360
Also the way killstreaks were in mw2, you were never really safe out in the grass. You could take cold blooded but you could easily get turned on by someone with stopping power even if you shoot first.
    There was this hut on one side I can remember vividly being in there with my 2 mates , all rocking interventions with thermals and a big stretch of field long grass to get to the hut , the best times
        The days before sniper glint 😔
I got my first Nuke on Wasteland using the Barrett .50 w/ ACOG. Just playing like an absolute piece of shit
    Lol the Barrett 50 cal was also a lovely rifle to use
I would agree if ground war / invasion weren’t just roof top sniper simulators already. I feel like I already have my go to place if I want to do longer range sniping. The other maps are good for aggressive sniping already. The MSR (spx-80) is the best feeling actual sniper rifle we’ve had in a mw game since the MSR in mw3 lol
Taraq exists
    Sure but if were talking about bringing back ALL of these maps like the first comment was saying then there's no point in leaving out 1 map because  of snipers.
        Tbf I think it’s a bizarre wish to have all the maps back. They weren’t *all* that good
The snipers have two whole modes to themselves
Play Ground war/Invasion?
If you have B and C and the opponent has A  they will mostly spawn behind a walled area with one way to escape and they'll get spawn camped to hell
The full game was a throawble fest everyone ran frag x3
    And martyrdom
Could you elaborate? I played scrims with clan mates back in the CoD2 and 4 days and what I miss most is the prominence of single shot rifles like Kar98k etc. I wouldn't think that sort of gameplay would be possible with modern Cod stylings.
That, and behind the escalator corners! Good memories!!
MW3’s biggest flaw is that people were getting burnt out by the MW series at that point and it was coming on the heels of Black Ops. People wanted something new and exciting, not a better version of what had come before. 

Imo, by most objective criteria it’s the best MW game of the series. Way more balanced than MW and MW2, tons of content, good maps, competitively viable but fun for casual play. The support killstreaks and specialist perk system were both really good additions, Stopping Power being gone freed up a lot of class creation options, nukes (sorry—MOABs) didn’t end games, it was just a ton of fun to play.
    totally agree with you, MW3 will always have a special place in my heart, I mean it's noy BO2 but I would argue a second place for sure.
    I just wanted more guns and more dlc maps lol
> the DLC tracts were also just as good

I would kill for them to bring back Sanctuary, Piazza, Black Box, Liberation, Boardwalk, or Foundation - all such great maps
Carnival!!
There's rumours that the big expansion in stead of a new game next year will have every OG MW2 map. See: xclusive ace's video on it.
    A bit bull shit to charge for it when the game launched with almost no maps. I thought the whole point of the cosmetics and battle pass were to farm whales and use them to push out content to keep engagement. Kinda lame to double dip
        I agree the game launched unfinished but this will be at the normal end of the life cycle. If it were vanguard it would only be just out this month. 

I wouldn't say it's double dipping but I do agree that the current state of the game is unacceptable for the price.
        It's just like mw2 days with DLC map packs. Full nostalgia of being a young teen and not being able to afford enough Microsoft points to get the new map pack
It's confirmed that Terminal map is inside the new Warzone 2 map. So it's just a matter of time for them to use it in MP.
Quarry, Terminal, Shipment, Afghan and Highrise are all on the Warzone 2 map.

You can find them if you setup a private match on Al Bagra Fortress, allow free cam and go into spectator mode.
I think they thought it was just done too many times. Would have been fun though
    Yet they release nuketown every 3 years without fail
Points 2 and 3 are completely valid. I hoped for those as they are base functions of a complete game so they dropped the ball there. I’m just saying it’s funny to say Activision isn’t in touch with their fans. They don’t care! They’re laughing all the way to the bank with a BILLION dollars. They do not care about any of the complaints, or being in touch with the community - we have showed them they don’t have to.
You just dropped a tactical nuke on r/callofdutymobile
    Man those 3 people are going to be pissed
It was a fun map though, Not everyone played like it was life and death like this mw2
    Dude I’ve been thinking this. People don’t play COD like they used to. It wasn’t nearly as big of a deal as people make it now.
        Everyone wants to be a streamer, YouTuber, tiktoker. We have an era of sweats that back then you weren’t competing with other sweats, but with casuals and ping/connection was the way we used to be in a lobby
            Everyone wanted to be mlg back then and would lie about being sponsored. Thing is we've gotten wayyy better at fps games. Red tiger was hard a fuck to get on controller back then despite being a laughable 150 headshots. I think I remember seeing a single gold camo gun back in mw1 (outside degal ofc) and I played a fuckload. We always tried hard, we just sucked. Everyone just wants to pop off and get a bunch of kills, not much has changed
        I used to hop on, play a few matches, scratch that itch with a couple of snipes. Now, I am constantly reviewing every aspect of the game and how I can improve
        Yeah those old MW and MW2 days were the best. No bunny hops, slides, 1000 sensitivity spin shit.

I used to actually get top of the board back then quite frequently. My skills have defo deteriorated with age but the game has also just turned super sweaty and unrealistic now
            You telling me you didn’t play with 12 sensitivity and run across the map with a USP and knife and a Intervention?
    True, there was a methodical playstyle to some of those Cod4 maps
People don’t realize what made these maps all fun is the diversity of play style. Nowadays all maps hit the same criteria and make sure everything is overly consistent
    Remember 15 years ago when only a a small percentage or people had turtle beach head sets and dead silence was optional.
        I had turtle beach, thought it looked so bad ass but was so cheaply made lol
I feel like it would be a perfect fit for mwii, just needs more clutter inside each building, and 50 feet more of unnecessary space behind each spawn
MW3 was my first COD game, and seeing all of the maps brought back so many good memories. Then I saw Carbon. I have no memories of Carbon lmao
why's that? Are they releasing it in the map pool then too?
    I think it’s just conjecture rn but it would be a wildly tone deaf move to not release it. So yeah they probably won’t lmao
Are you serious omggg
    Yeah I think it was in a trailer or some footage they released

look it up  
"Ahkdar Village" :)
        An old town fit for a showdown 😎
Honestly, I know it's controversial, but it's my favorite CoD. Very satisfying campaign, way more balanced than MW2, while retaining the speed and fluidity from it that BO1 lacked. Infected was incredible, as was kill confirmed. Extremely fun and dynamic maps. Good times man. I wish more people liked it
    Yeah same. For me it had the best weapon selection and perks in the series. It introduced weapon levelling, score streaks and specialist. Then there was infected, drop zone, juggernaut game modes etc. Man the game was endless fun.
    It’s always amazed me that so many people say MW2 was better. That’s gotta be pure nostalgia speaking, because MW3 was basically the same exact game mechanically but with better maps and better balance.
        The one thing I'll say in MW2's favor is the presentation felt more "video game-y." By that I mean the sound effects and colors were a bit more cartoony and fun, whereas MW3 felt like the more serious older brother with everything being gray and brown and the sounds more muted.
            Yeah I can see that. MW2 had brighter colors for sure.
        MW 2 is my favorite but it’s also the one I had the most playtime in by far. Had 1500+ hours in it compared to 300-400 in mw3. Pretty much stopped playing COD after that.
    They need to bring back the guitar solos and explosions that happen every time I level up. It’s honestly shocking they don’t try harder to capitalize on that nostalgia. Felt so badass doing basic things
    By far my favourite. Then its BO2. But the gap is pretty big.
        For me it’s 1A. BO2 1B. MW3
mw1/2/3 & bo1/2 easy top 5 in any order
Returned in AW.
It was on Mobile.
Wow I had no idea
Yeah they updated it to be more Space-y, but it was only a graphics change.
Yeah I didn't include maps if they returned in MW2 or MW3 either. The only 2 that fit that criteria are Overgrown & Strike from CoD4 which have only returned in MW2.
Mw2 was not a balanced game but man it was fun
    I mean if everything was OP, didn't that really make nothing OP?

Outside of the early 1887's, there really wasn't any gun that was far above or below the rest from what I remember, outside of the AUG specifically being a bit weak maybe?
        I want my TAR back
            And ACR
                yeah i loved the acr. NGL with heartbeat attached ofc
                    All it needs is a red dot sight :) loved those iron sights too
                MP5, Spas-12 combo. The Sandy Ravage special.
                Acr goated for real i just want it back
            The ram-7 did okay at being a replacement but just not the same
            The TAR was by far my favorite weapon in multiplayer. I’m convinced they gave it good iron sights because the devs knew that the red dot was damn ugly
            Yeah I miss that gun
        There was something about the UMP45 that made it busted. It's been 13 years, so details are hazy, but I think it was that the regular suppressor penalties didn't apply to the UMP45, and it naturally had very low recoil with the muzzle flash removed by the suppressor, so that made it an all-round gun that could fill any role and was a menace in the right hands. It wasn't anywhere near as famous of an exploit as One Man Army and such, so it wasn't a plague on the game. Just one of those things where skilled players knew to watch out for the guy rocking a suppressed UMP45, because that player knew what was up and was definitely trying for high killstreaks.
            Silenced UMP45 and Akimbo Rangers all. damn. day!
                That was my go to setup to attempt to drop a nuke. Fond memories of running absolutely rampant in Favela.
            It could double as an assault rifle because of it's crazy range, good damage, fire rate and low recoil. But the fact that it was an SMG meant you could also Rush with it. Really was a Swiss Army Knife as far as durability, and depending on the routes you navigate Multi-player maps with, Usually outclassed anything you'd come across. UMP+Spas-12 in the right hands was untouchable
            I also remember the boost it got from stopping power was almost useless so it was the perfect smg to run with ghost
            Yup and you could speed up the fire rate I use to run wild with it!!! Thanks for the memory lane my man!!!!
        One man army noob tubes, commando pro, and painkiller deathstreak are the main things I remember being bullshit in that game
            Even better in mw3 we had death mans hand as a death streak. For those fortunate enough to not have encountered such nightmare, instead of dying you entered a “final stand” stance and had a c4 remote at hand. You then roleplayed as a suicide bomber, but for some reason they gave you a pocket nuke. That shit had about a 15m radius for no reason and it always one shot no matter how far you were
            Holy shit I forgot all about the death streaks
                [deleted]
                    Martyrdom and final stand. So basically the annoying "revenge" perks they got rid of from cod4
                Holy shit I forgot all about wrecking shop with nothing but a knife and commando pro
        IIRC the WA2000 was basically a hybrid of the disadvantages of the Intervention/Barrett (low mobility, slow ADS) with the disadvantages of the M14 (lower damage). There wasn't really a point in running it, ever.

And the whole LMG class suffered from the same problem it has suffered ever since: Not mobile enough to actually move around, and not powerful enough to camp. The RPD and MG4 were somewhat viable, but I remember the L86/AUG/M240 to be pretty shite.

And I do remember the F2000 to be pretty bad with low damage and bad recoil, but I might be misremembering that.
            >IIRC the WA2000 was basically a hybrid of the disadvantages of the Intervention/Barrett (low mobility, slow ADS) with the disadvantages of the M14 (lower damage). There wasn't really a point in running it, ever.

It was a troll weapon. Nothing like outsniping some kids in Search with the WA and every time they see their kill cam they gotta see the smiley face sticker on the scope cover

And even then it wasn't an awful gun by any means, just was far and away the worst option for snipers. Was still a 1 shot for head, neck and chest IIRC unless you put a silencer on it
                Yeah, certainly. In other CoDs it would probably have been considered decent, in MW2 it was not only the worst option in it's class by considerable margin, it was also outclassed by the FAL with an ACOG (or thermal scope, don't remember). I guess that fits OPs bill of a gun that was far below the rest.

But honestly I think that because there was no point in playing guns you didn't want meant that you never felt being at a disadvantage. You were never forced into unfair engagements because you needed to grind a gun to unlock something for a different gun. And since the default classes already gave you a FAMAS+SPAS, an UMP or a Barrett you were pretty much settled from the get go.
                A bit late but actually it was the sniper rifle that didn't suffer at all with a silencer, provided you were running stopping power as usual. For example silencing the Barrett/Intervention brought their 1HKO from head+chest+stomach to head+chest. 

WA2000 was head+chest by default so the idea was to either silence it and use stopping power, or use it unsilenced without stopping power. If you were using it unsilenced with stopping power then yeah it was straight up trolling and worse than other options.

I found the latter pretty nice with cold blooded pro on the open sniping maps since people would scan for red names and killstreaks would sit in the sky 24/7.
            The WA2000 definitely wasn't outstanding and required a pretty unique sniping playstyle, but it was far from a poor weapon and was at least on par with the Barrett if not better in the right hands. It was also the only semi auto actually viable for quick scoping and I remember seeing more than one really good player absolutely  wreck with it (it was just far less forgiving than just using the intervention, and like someone mentioned below, ironically outclassed by most things with an ACOG)

    IIRC the WA2000 was basically a hybrid of the disadvantages of the Intervention/Barrett (low mobility, slow ADS) with the disadvantages of the M14 (lower damage). There wasn't really a point in running it, ever.

And the whole LMG class suffered from the same problem it has suffered ever since: Not mobile enough to actually move around, and not powerful enough to camp. The RPD and MG4 were somewhat viable, but I remember the L86/AUG/M240 to be pretty shite.

And I do remember the F2000 to be pretty bad with low damage and bad recoil, but I might be misremembering that.
        >IIRC the WA2000 was basically a hybrid of the disadvantages of the Intervention/Barrett (low mobility, slow ADS) with the disadvantages of the M14 (lower damage). There wasn't really a point in running it, ever.

It was a troll weapon. Nothing like outsniping some kids in Search with the WA and every time they see their kill cam they gotta see the smiley face sticker on the scope cover

And even then it wasn't an awful gun by any means, just was far and away the worst option for snipers. Was still a 1 shot for head, neck and chest IIRC unless you put a silencer on it
            Yeah, certainly. In other CoDs it would probably have been considered decent, in MW2 it was not only the worst option in it's class by considerable margin, it was also outclassed by the FAL with an ACOG (or thermal scope, don't remember). I guess that fits OPs bill of a gun that was far below the rest.

But honestly I think that because there was no point in playing guns you didn't want meant that you never felt being at a disadvantage. You were never forced into unfair engagements because you needed to grind a gun to unlock something for a different gun. And since the default classes already gave you a FAMAS+SPAS, an UMP or a Barrett you were pretty much settled from the get go.
            A bit late but actually it was the sniper rifle that didn't suffer at all with a silencer, provided you were running stopping power as usual. For example silencing the Barrett/Intervention brought their 1HKO from head+chest+stomach to head+chest. 

WA2000 was head+chest by default so the idea was to either silence it and use stopping power, or use it unsilenced without stopping power. If you were using it unsilenced with stopping power then yeah it was straight up trolling and worse than other options.

I found the latter pretty nice with cold blooded pro on the open sniping maps since people would scan for red names and killstreaks would sit in the sky 24/7.
        The WA2000 definitely wasn't outstanding and required a pretty unique sniping playstyle, but it was far from a poor weapon and was at least on par with the Barrett if not better in the right hands. It was also the only semi auto actually viable for quick scoping and I remember seeing more than one really good player absolutely  wreck with it (it was just far less forgiving than just using the intervention, and like someone mentioned below, ironically outclassed by most things with an ACOG)

I disagree about the LMGs. The AUG and L86 definitely just felt like crappy assault rifles and didn't see much use, but the RPD, M240, and MG4 were very common and incredibly effective in Domination and Headquarters among hard objective players
            The WA2000 was nice for anyone who crunched the numbers back then and saw it was the go to weapon for silenced+SP or unsilenced+non SP sniping.
    Imo ump-45 was above other guns. It was good even at long distances. Talking only about HC.
        You definitely could bink people at range in hardcore with that gun
    I had that realization looking back. Like marathon/lightweight/commando was STUPID but so was me being able to rapid fire a barret 50 cal with a thermal scope or the lack of recoil on an RPD LMG. The game was FUN albeit chaotic fun

EDIT: Shame on me for not adding One Man Army/Danger Close and Noob tubes.
    Y’all talking about the TAR and ACR, but the real weapon was the SCAR with FMJ rounds.
        Big facts
    I loved the AUG, I actually thought it was the best LMG alongside the RPD.  

I agree though, every gun being fairly strong felt good in that game.
If you knew how to use the AC-130, that thing absolutely SHREDDED.
    The AC-130 took more kills to get and rarely got you enough to get the nuke. If you had them spawn camped, the AC-130 was superior. However, if they weren't spawn camped, you wanted the chopper gunner

Source: young me got over 100+ nukes and was absolutely obsessed with it
The days before sniper glint 😔
Tbf I think it’s a bizarre wish to have all the maps back. They weren’t *all* that good
I agree the game launched unfinished but this will be at the normal end of the life cycle. If it were vanguard it would only be just out this month. 

I wouldn't say it's double dipping but I do agree that the current state of the game is unacceptable for the price.
It's just like mw2 days with DLC map packs. Full nostalgia of being a young teen and not being able to afford enough Microsoft points to get the new map pack
Everyone wants to be a streamer, YouTuber, tiktoker. We have an era of sweats that back then you weren’t competing with other sweats, but with casuals and ping/connection was the way we used to be in a lobby
    Everyone wanted to be mlg back then and would lie about being sponsored. Thing is we've gotten wayyy better at fps games. Red tiger was hard a fuck to get on controller back then despite being a laughable 150 headshots. I think I remember seeing a single gold camo gun back in mw1 (outside degal ofc) and I played a fuckload. We always tried hard, we just sucked. Everyone just wants to pop off and get a bunch of kills, not much has changed
I used to hop on, play a few matches, scratch that itch with a couple of snipes. Now, I am constantly reviewing every aspect of the game and how I can improve
Yeah those old MW and MW2 days were the best. No bunny hops, slides, 1000 sensitivity spin shit.

I used to actually get top of the board back then quite frequently. My skills have defo deteriorated with age but the game has also just turned super sweaty and unrealistic now
    You telling me you didn’t play with 12 sensitivity and run across the map with a USP and knife and a Intervention?
I had turtle beach, thought it looked so bad ass but was so cheaply made lol
An old town fit for a showdown 😎
The one thing I'll say in MW2's favor is the presentation felt more "video game-y." By that I mean the sound effects and colors were a bit more cartoony and fun, whereas MW3 felt like the more serious older brother with everything being gray and brown and the sounds more muted.
    Yeah I can see that. MW2 had brighter colors for sure.
MW 2 is my favorite but it’s also the one I had the most playtime in by far. Had 1500+ hours in it compared to 300-400 in mw3. Pretty much stopped playing COD after that.
For me it’s 1A. BO2 1B. MW3
I want my TAR back
    And ACR
        yeah i loved the acr. NGL with heartbeat attached ofc
            All it needs is a red dot sight :) loved those iron sights too
        MP5, Spas-12 combo. The Sandy Ravage special.
        Acr goated for real i just want it back
    The ram-7 did okay at being a replacement but just not the same
    The TAR was by far my favorite weapon in multiplayer. I’m convinced they gave it good iron sights because the devs knew that the red dot was damn ugly
    Yeah I miss that gun
There was something about the UMP45 that made it busted. It's been 13 years, so details are hazy, but I think it was that the regular suppressor penalties didn't apply to the UMP45, and it naturally had very low recoil with the muzzle flash removed by the suppressor, so that made it an all-round gun that could fill any role and was a menace in the right hands. It wasn't anywhere near as famous of an exploit as One Man Army and such, so it wasn't a plague on the game. Just one of those things where skilled players knew to watch out for the guy rocking a suppressed UMP45, because that player knew what was up and was definitely trying for high killstreaks.
    Silenced UMP45 and Akimbo Rangers all. damn. day!
        That was my go to setup to attempt to drop a nuke. Fond memories of running absolutely rampant in Favela.
    It could double as an assault rifle because of it's crazy range, good damage, fire rate and low recoil. But the fact that it was an SMG meant you could also Rush with it. Really was a Swiss Army Knife as far as durability, and depending on the routes you navigate Multi-player maps with, Usually outclassed anything you'd come across. UMP+Spas-12 in the right hands was untouchable
    I also remember the boost it got from stopping power was almost useless so it was the perfect smg to run with ghost
    Yup and you could speed up the fire rate I use to run wild with it!!! Thanks for the memory lane my man!!!!
One man army noob tubes, commando pro, and painkiller deathstreak are the main things I remember being bullshit in that game
    Even better in mw3 we had death mans hand as a death streak. For those fortunate enough to not have encountered such nightmare, instead of dying you entered a “final stand” stance and had a c4 remote at hand. You then roleplayed as a suicide bomber, but for some reason they gave you a pocket nuke. That shit had about a 15m radius for no reason and it always one shot no matter how far you were
    Holy shit I forgot all about the death streaks
