[[Let's talk about the SPAS-12]]


This gun fucking rocks man. I love it. Extended mags in incredible for it. I think I need to start recording myself playing with it some how. I play FFA with the SPAS-12 only and go 30-5. I play TDM with the SPAS-12 only and go 34-6. The gun can't be stopped. It's incredible. 


Post-1887 patch, the SPAS-12 is the best shotgun with it's awesome range and OHK potential, but for some reason the M1014 + Extmags remains my favorite lol, M1014 isn't the best like the SPAS, but my favorite.
    I'm with you, M1014 + grip + steady aim is my favorite shotgun.
        Yep, I love it. It's got decent range and is decent at everything just not good at one thing. The grip is good but not as good when you get extended mags.
has some craaaazy range
    Yeah, especially before they they fixed it, the range was almost comparable to an SMG.
I play hardcore religiously, and taking this gun out when you know someone is coming is borderline cheating. Just put them relatively in the middle of your screen and blast away.

On a lot of maps it is the best gun in the game, hands down.
I agree, Spas-12 with grip is the best secondary weapon in the game.

Slap on Marathon, Stopping Power and Steady Aim and you're set for destruction. Also, try to never aim down sights with it. It's been proven that with hip fire it has a tighter spread and longer range. 
    reallyyyyyyyyyy?  hmmm, i'm always trying to line up my shot and it never really hurts me in the long run.
    I was with you until you said hipfire > ADS. You sure its not just the same?
        Yep. There are numerous videos testing it, I think Woodysgamertag did one. 

Also, just watch some of Sandy Ravage's gameplay. You'll see how he'll shoot a target aiming down sights, get no hit, then fire from the hip to get the kill. ADS might make you a bit more accurate or feel more natural, but if you don't hit them try hip firing. 
            Watching all of Sandy Ravage's videos is what made me fall in love with the SPAS. I just watched the test by Woodysgamertag and it showed that w/o Steady Aim, ADS and hipfiring are the same, but with Steady Aim, ADS has a wider spread than hipfiring.
                Well yes, of course with SA hipefiring will be more accurate. What I'm saying is that it will give the SPAS range, although that might be because of SA in the first place. :P 
                    I saw nothing in either of Woodysgamertag's SPAS test videos that indicated any attachments or firing styles affect the range.
    generally you dont always have to hip
down the sights in close combat is a good option
This is the WORST weapon for me in the gun game...
