[[What call of duty pill you choosing]]





For me this is simple, blue pill 100%
    100% blue pill as well
    Fuck yeah. Easy blue pill 100%
    I broke this all down in my head and was like, why is Dome in Red Pill, it should also be Blue Pilled heavy lol

Off topic but Hijacked SnD spawn tube turned into an every game for sure kill. Scummy but nostalgic now.
        Noob tube across the map ü§£. There were quite a few maps and game types on older COD‚Äôs this could be accomplished!
            In old mw2 I had a class with blast shield and one man army so I always survived the opening tubes.
            None worse Than wet works xD
            Can't forget the nade on Backlot the tube on wasteland
            Yeah but not too many people did it or expected it on Hijacked.
    Favela has been my favorite map since it came out. Then terminal is up there, dome, shipment from mw1. 

Either way, it's a solid line up with the firing range on it.
    Definitely firing range is my favourite map
I'm double dosing
    I‚Äôm overdosing. I‚Äôd of loved firing range in Cold War or maybe even now in MW3 but in Cold War alone I have easily 4000 games played on Nuketown.
How is this even a debate? Blue pill easily
    Do people even like crashed? It feels so open.
        I do but It‚Äôs not even close to terminal
            Respectable. I agree terminal being blue side killed this vote.
            The first time I played crash in VR I was floored. Taking advantage of old camping spots and angles against 15 year Olds that had no idea was enough to bring a tear to my eye
                There‚Äôs a specific secret spot in the MW3 version of terminal that makes me feel the same way, in MW2 you can get in the area near the explosive gas tank, but in MW3, the small pipes on the front of the small brick platform with the tank itself and a radiator has collision and can be jumped on, making for an incredible spot to camp in
        It's the only map I nuked on in 2019 and I did it repeatedly. Something is really cheesy about that map
Replace Dome with rust and you got a deal. Otherwise Blue pill
    Idk why people like 6v6 rust and Nuketown..

Tiny maps in general...everytime it comes up, its utter chaos and most the players complain how bad the spawn kills are.

It's just weird that ingame I hear complaints, but on forums I hear praise.

It fun for the rarity and novelty (of rust in MW2, it's super rare map). And I'm fine with it...but hear lots of complaints.
        Nuketown actually has structure unlike rust and shipment, both sides spawn at their house and it plays like a normal map only faster. Rust, shipment, and dome don‚Äôt really have that and it‚Äôs more random chaos
        trash players complain and good players enjoy
            Yeah because no casual players want to be killed instantly on spawning. It sucks ass. Great for aholes who remember spawn points and camp
                How do you not know the spawn points on Shipment there's like 5 of them lmao
                then dont play the game mode üòÇ like you clicked on it
Blue, although nuke town is great
    Blue is probably the better choice, but Nuketown makes me go red 100%.
        This is exactly my conclusion as well
        Yeah I‚Äôm going red and doing Nuketown only. I‚Äôve been doing basically that since 2015 now anyway
    No it is not
Red feels more competitive
    Standoff the only good SND map listed
        MW3 Dome hella fun for CTF and decent SND
        Well SND is butt so that might be why
            Agreed snd is fucking boring
            SnD carried multiplayer this game. It‚Äôs not a brainless mode that takes no skill.
                Yea if their was one game the SnD was at its height it‚Äôs gotta be bo2
            POV you're bad at COD
                I personally believe if you want to play snd you should be playing cs.
    which is crazy how many people will hate you for not liking SBMM but then would rather play non competitive maps.
Blue pill. Favela sold it for me.
    RIP favela PC...this is why we should allow non-hacking mods. If developers drop a game, we don't have to
Blue
Blue 100% I've had some of my best matches ever on Favela and Terminal
Red
    Seek help
        Lmao why
            Because your opinion is different from my opinion..?
        Standoff shits on every single one of these maps combined ten times over and then comes back for seconds
Red. 100%
    Yes. This is the only way. People saying blue are basic AF.
        I feel like its only reason people are saying blue is because hijacked and terminal. But crash is good. Dome is as good as terminal. Nuke town is better than hijacked. And standoff is imo waaaayyyyyy better than firing range.
            Your logic is sound.
                unsound*
Only time I‚Äôm ever taking a bluepill
Id eat both of them and chew them, not even swallow whole
Red pill IF it was WaW's Dome
Dome ruined that red pill for me. Blue is a go
Eating both
hijacked + terminal are fire, but firing range and favela are overrated imo, every map on red pill is goated. definitely a hard choice but I'm going red.
Blue
Blue
Blue pill is the only right answer
Separating nuke town and hijack should be illegal
Has to be Favala edging it out here!
Blue pill babyyyyyyy
Blue, 100% of the time.
Favela I miss you ü•π
fuck
Nuke town with zombies brings back good times. Lots of screaming at the higher levels.
blue all day
Red but terminal is testing me
Blue but add Rust. 

Standoff and Nuketown and good maps though. 

Hardhat is better than Dome, but Dome is better than most current Call of Duty Maps.
    Hard hat is a great map, played half way decent in Mw2019 too imo
Blue pill
Crush them both and snort them
Blue
Left cooks imo
Blue pill because red they've remade too many times
Dome really ruined the red pill imo
blue all the way
Blue. Nuke was good but that's about it for that side
Nuketown,dome,hijacked, terminal, perfectly balanced.
Hijacked is just different
If you don‚Äôt take blue pill you on that goofy shit
See I see Nuketown and Dome and immediately want the red pill but I see Firing Range, Hijacked, and Terminal and must choose Blue
Can I have the bottom half of both red and blue?
Damn bro you makin me choose between Nuketown and Terminal?
Red easily for dome
Blue
RED RED RED RED RED RED
Nuke town, firing range, hijacked & crash
I gotta go with red, nuke town and crash are my favorites
Red all the way! Hijacked and Terminal go hard too tho
Don‚Äôt make me pick!

Can I take purple

Stand-off 
Crash
Terminal 
Hijacked
Blue pill EASY
Red pill solely for nuketown
Both, I'm gonna play some custom maps om IW4X
I hope favela will be back with Mw3
Red.
Blue
Blue pill.  Half of these maps ain‚Äôt even mw2 though
Purple pill. Give me Nuketown, Standoff, Hijacked, and Favela
Red baby
definitely blue pill
Blue
Fuck.
blue is way better, except for favela üòë
Purple
Lmao blue. Obviously.
Red
Azul.
Blue ftw. Terminal really just puts it over the top
Red pill. RED PILL. REEED PIIIILL 

(‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞)‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª
Blue pill me
Red pill
the one with terminal tf???
B
L
U
E
Nuketown is broken and always has been
EASILY red
Get rid of Hijacked and my only problem with Blue is resolved.
Bro was really hoping nuketown on red pill would carry some weight üò∞
Would trade Hijacked for Crash and Firing range for Nuketown, but either way - Blue pill for sure.
Purple pill: wasteland 24/7
Red pill
Easy blue‚Ä¶ though, i want to swap hijacked for dome
standoff, hijacked, terminal, firing range
others ones are just ok
blue pill for hijacked lol
I‚Äôm a red guy
Red, the only good ones are Blue are Hijacked and Terminal. Nuketown is easily beating both of those.
Red should be the obvious choice. I would draft firing range also. Terminal is just nostalgic and the other 2 I‚Äôve never liked at all tbh
Everything but hijakced
Red for sure
I'm taking both so I can still have nuketown
Next time make it not so obvious‚Ä¶blue is the only correct choice here
I feel insane choosing Red, like I‚Äôm the only one
Blue for sure. Both are solid choices though tbh
Favela is one of the greatest cod maps of all time
100% red simply for nuketown. Too bad gluboko isn‚Äôt in there too
First of all‚Ä¶.. it‚Äôs ‚ÄúStudio‚Äù
Bluepill FTW
Firing range, favela, and terminal? Blue pill is the VERY easy choice.
Blue
Red dog lol
Had me with the first one, but lost me with the last 3. Blue pill 100
As cringe as it sounds...Red Pill
blue pill would be perfect if hijacked was stand-off or slums
blue pill.. its not even fair haha
Blue
Red pill no question, stand-off with always be a nostalgic map for me
First, half of red and then half of blue
Blue pill for sure
Crash almost soloed but blue got favela and terminal so gotta go blue
Red pill
Red pill but if it were high rise instead of favela blue pill
Terminal goes hard asf
Terminal is the best map for me.
Nuketown standoff firing range terminal
God I miss standoff, but Terminal is unbeatable
can i pick both


FR and Favela i dislike, but i don't like dome or standoff either
Red
Damn, that‚Äôs a tough decision üòÆ‚Äçüí®
I want a 3rd option with a mix of bothüòÇ
Yo hijacked was the shit
Bold take but left just because of standiff
Red Pill, but only because I play COD Mobile, and I get Nuketown and Crash damn near all of the time. Swap the sphere map with Hijacked and Standoff with Crossfire and it's perfect.
Blue pill is the only correct option
Nuketown Standoff Hijacked Terminal. Pp pilled.
Both
Red got fire with Crash but Blue has 4 maps i straight up enjoy
Blue all day
Afgan.
Def blue if you pick red I don‚Äôt think you even play cod
Blue pill clearly has the better options.

But the first time I ever played call of duty was on crash and that Nostalgia that pulled me in could always pull me back.
tbh hijacked is the only good blue pill option, so easily red
Idc, NukeTown
Blue pill, but standoff is such a phenomenal map
Blue just for Favela
de_dust2
Red Pill. Only because Crash is my favorite.
Whichever one has Fallen
So no Rust?
Red, 100% of the time.
Easiest choice ever. Blue all the way.
I have to go blue because of how much I hated crash.
Where's the other pill with Carentan?
got more time in nuketown/crash than any of the others ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

You got some Black Ops maps mixed in both choices. 

I'm taking the red one though.
Blue. Like nuketown and standoff is my favorite map. Dome is pretty decent too
im overdosing because im taking both, but if i have to then blue
Omg standoff tho üî•
Although firing range and hijacked are godly‚Ä¶ nuketown is the superior map. RED PILL!
Honestly like maps from both. It if I had to choose one group to play forever, blue pill.
üòÇüòÇüòÇ off rip blue but than my head started thinking bout nuketown ü§ßü§ßü§ß I love you nukey
What about the green pill: favela, dome, crash, terminal
Stand-off and Dome? Nah. We RedPillin‚Äô
Gotta go red for me, Dome holds a special place in my heart same as nuketown
Red all day, s&d forever
Blue, although Standoff is great
Im also picking blue because ive played so much red
Red. I really started with mw3/ bo2 and I know crash off of MWR. No notable memories of playing favela or terminal for me unfortunately
Red pill
Nuke town. I would play nothing but og nuke town till I die and be happy
Blue‚Ä¶ Crash ruined red for me
It's tough but I gotta go blue üíô
Red Pill, 10000% no contest.
This is tough because I like both Bo1 and bo2 maps i terminal more than crash but favela i remember not being very good
Red easily. Probably change Crash with Shipment.
I love them all I literally can't choose.
Red
It's blue pill and I HATE hijacked
Blue pill + nuketown
Red easily
Red
Red
Get rid of nuketown and give me terminal or favela and il grabt he red pill. Hate nuketown but love favela and terminal
Red
Tango Sucka
blue but nuketown and dome are both great as well.
Blue easy
All these maps are trash
Blue pill
Shotgun nerf
Blue me expeditiously üòÇ
Blue is the only right answer
unpopular opinion:red
Nobody picking red pill because of dome being too terrible for anything other than infected
Standoff just too good I‚Äôll take it
Blue pill
Red
Honestly I‚Äôd have to say red pill just because I dislike favela a ton.
blue pill by a mile
Red
Red
RED, cause STANDOFF was my favorite map on BOPS2
red pill dont care
If we could swap Crash for firing range it would be perfect. Still going with blue pill regardless
blue pill fs
Blue
Blue
Blue without question
Blue pill
Blue
Red pill all day
Always the red!
Blue all day, but nuke town is fun
I'm taking red
Red pill all day
Hijacked was iconic, but standoff was pretty amazing too
Blue
Where's shipment?
TERMINAL SOLOS
I‚Äôd be Red Pill if Standoff wasn‚Äôt there, like why standoff and not Scrapyard or even shipment?
Red pill, I used to enjoy sniping people on nuketown back in the day
Red
Blue
Nuketown, Standoff, Hijacked, and Terminal.
Blue pill EASYYY
Blue pill for me, dawg.
Blue like crazy, if for nothing but firing range.
Both nuketown and hijacked good for throwing hatchets ü™ì
Blue
Red pill and by a long shot, I‚Äôve had my best matches on nuke town
I don't understand how Red is not the immediate choice lol
Red
Red
Blue
Hijacked.
Red all day
Nuketown got so old after playing it literally thousands of times. I can go without ever playing that or Shipment again lol.
Red pill 100%
Favela with a tar21 and stopping power it‚Äôs over lol
It‚Äôs blue pill, legendary terminal and firing range. 
Red pill has nuketown and crash but nuke town holds the whole pick together. Where is rust and shipment at?!ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
blue and it‚Äôs not even close. not even debatable. not even worth the time making this picture.
Blue
Literally my favorite maps are Nuketown, Standoff, Hijacked and Terminal üòÇ
Blue because I'm fucking tired of nuketown
I'm gonna overdose
Blue easy
Where's rust?!
Red for sure.
Whatever pill is terminal. I'll take the whole script in one go. And wash it down with some Terminal Tea. 

*gulp*
I hate crash but love all the blue pill makes but the red pill maps are way more fun
I choose the purple pill which will give me all the maps PLUS Raid
I just want all of these but instead I get Santa Sena border crossing
Blue
Which pill is the bottom 4?
I‚Äôm taking both and you can‚Äôt stop me
Blue is the easiest choice of my life. Crash sucks.
Blue
Blue pill, growing up before the age of 12 I had no idea what multiplayer was aside from split screen and favela and terminal were the best. I would probably choose red if it had rust and estates tho
Nuketown or highjack spent many hours on them two man
Red
I don't know actually. Most of these have been ruined by campers
Blue all fucking day
red fs
Blue, dome for me has always been meh not bad but not great either
Favela or terminal = nuke incoming
Give me raid over any of these
Blue pill and it‚Äôs not even close.
Do have to ask BLUE ALL DAY BABY!
red dome is such a bop
Red, dome was my shit
Red, easiest shit ever
Let me get that PURPLE pill
Blue definitely
Red is where i made all my memories
Redpill, blue is for campers
Blue, but red during Nuketown 24/7
Blue
Hot take nuketown is the most overrated map of all time
Red all the way since you mentioned crash
Red my guy
BLUE
Blue
Blue pill without a doubt
Should‚Äôve put one of the mw2 maps on the red pill side too easy
I don‚Äôt really like nuke town honestly but still red
Blue
Blue by a long shot.
I have a hard time thinking of 3 maps better than terminal
Easily the Blue Pill
Outside MW2(2022) I only know the top 4 so can I have a light purple??üòÖ
Ill take nuketown standoff hijacked and favela please ‚òùÔ∏è
Red all day
Idk maybe red pill but then I'm just take the blue pill it's a hard one dude lol
Blue
Red pill all the way, I was a survival mode guy.
Going me a yellow pill rust and high rise baby
Red pill here
Red pill. Not close
Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare
Red pill if I get to play survival on dome again. Also who can pass up nuke town mmm
Terminal instead of standoff would make the most op pill I have ever seen
If I could only play these maps and like in real life to asleep sheep id "red pill" except first two blue maps are great too
Blue pill, obv
You really making me choose between standoff and hijacked?
Red pill for Stand-off alone
just need hijacked
1 cuz nuketown
red
The one that has balance and sn actual anticheat.not anti free speech!!!!!!!! 100%
ü•∂
red because dome. dome is best. change my mind
Blue for hijacked. Loved hxc dom on it.
Red tbh
tough because I hate Dome and Favela equally.
If you choose blue pill, your opinions are incorrect
Blue pill all day everyday. You could call me a blue pill junkie
Blue definitely üëç
Blue without a doubt
Hard ass decision
blue pill
Blue for sure honestly just for terminal. That was such a good one
Red Pill
nothing beats terminal javelin glitch team wipes when it comes to these maps, aside from that, favela and terminal made most players rely on actually using skill since they couldnt really rely on gunships / killstreaks or camp
I hate to do it to terminal and hijacked. But standoff alone is why I‚Äôd choose red.
honestly, was never a fan of standoff therefore im gonna have to go with blue. On top of that i find the blue maps to be better anyways.
Blue pill.
purple pill
I have to go with blue. The only reason I would take red is for nuketown and it ain‚Äôt worth it. Firing range? Hell yeah. Hijacked was pretty fun to rush on, Favela was chaotic I loved it, and Terminal? It‚Äôs where I learned to do all sorts of shit sniping and rushing
Combine them to make the purple pill üòà
Firing range already had my vote but terminal too?
Red button since Standoff holds a special place in my heart. I had 41-0 streak on there running laps around some ‚ÄúFaZe‚Äù kids back on BO2 with the peace keeper and DMR üòÖ
Blue, Terminal trumps any map on this list. I have hella good memories on both Terminal and Dome but overall Terminal is better for multiplayer. Dome for survival obviously.
It‚Äôs not even fair. Blue
Blue pill üîµ
Both have great maps but have to go red because of Nuketown
Nuketown and standoff all fucking day
Red eery day
blue pill. Hijacked and Terminal are unmatched
Blue
Blue boy
Blue pill
Blue. Nuketown is so overrated. I've had some good times on that map going crazy in the other teams spawn but like overall it's just chaos. Hijacked is a bit more controlled and come on, Firing Range, Favela and TERMINAL!!! Oh buddy, meet me at the burger town
blue, we already have standoff and nuketown
Blue all day. Terminal?!
Blue pill but I would wanna switch Favela with Nuketown
Red. Crash wins it for me. A lot of great memories playing that map. So much so that I‚Äôd take it over any other map listed. Loved it.
Gimme da red gum
Nuketown skidrow dome and rust 
To make this an even debate
Blue, infected on terminal was the best thing ever on mw3
blue‚Ä¶ wtf kinda question
I‚Äôd rather kms
Redpill and basted
I'll take the yellow pill that is shipment lol

In all seriousness, tough choice. Not sure which way I lean.
Blue not even close. Nuketown gets pretty boring when the entire lobby spam votes it every time it comes up. And Firing Range is one of my favorite maps of all time
Red Pill
Red pill every day
Hate nuketown but red has the better maps no question. Crash is top tier.
red
i choose Hell Let Loose
Blue easily
Red pill

Nuketown: GOATED WITH THE SAUCE (certified)
Standoff: SND GOAT (not cringe, based)
Dome: noob tube/RPG camp (juiced W/O sauce)
Crash: only playable map on CoD mobile (medium rare)

Firing range: cringe/no maidens (die)
Hijacked: beta males nuketown (max cringe)
Favela: forgotten. (CRY)
Terminal: ref- Snakes on a Plane, 2006 (no step)
I don't know
 I want both
I had more fun on blue side but more nostalgia on the red side
Alternate answer;

The syringe: Caspian border, operation firestorm, operation metro, grand bazar, gulf of oman... etc.
Blue all day
Blue. Nuketown is wayyyy to played out at this point.
Red pill. Nuke town and standoff was my favorite maps. Now just exchange crash for hijacked and it‚Äôs perfect.
the mfs who say blue pill are 35+
Crash is on the wrong side lol
Hijacked was awesome as part of the BO4 battle royale map. As its own standalone map though? Bruh
Crash takes my heart, have to take that red pill
Blue
Red pill for domination blue pill ffa
can h make my own pill? like for me my fav naps were nuketown, stand-off, hijacked and firing range
Blue pill
Blue
Trade crash for terminal and you'll never need another map again
Blue pill
Man as mich as I like firing range I am much more nostalgic for the red pill maps.
Can honestly say I've 5-6 person clutched every single one of these...Hardcore SnD or get out üòÜ
Easy choice popping blue and red and grabbing the Vaseline
Red easily
I can‚Äôt actually make up my mind
Blueeeee
blue pill easy choice
Red pill
Kobe map
Red bro
Blue no dif
Blue
Terminal carries the blue pill
Red simply because of Standoff
Blue
I'll have half of each please, two from each
Blue easily. I prefer mid sized more structured maps over small random maps.
Swap the middle two and it‚Äôs blue pill.
Heroine from my aunts antique 1886 spoon collection.
Dome is nostalgic to me bc of Requis, but blue pill
Blue
Red pill is nice. I like red pill. I was going to take red pill. But I took blue.
Blue, nuketown is tough to chose against but the strength of the blues maps is just unmatched
Give me the blue pill. Favela and terminal are all I need.
Blue, but I do love the dome and Nuke town!!!
If you choose red something is wrong with you
Blue, hijacked is one of my favorite maps
Bout to experiment with the purple pill üòÇ
I was the one with the sniper on Crash. You know exactly where I was camping it, don‚Äôt even gotta say it.
Easy red
Blue
Blue üíô
I think the old mw maps are overrated I don't like dome or terminal. I love standoff highjacked and most black ops maps.
Replace favela with stand-off and blue is crazy
I have to take the red pill just for Nuketown
Swap favela and nuke town and I‚Äôll take blue
Red and it's not even close, y'all smokin crack or something, guess it depends if you like constant cqb action or not. Purely based off that I only play domination, hard point, TDM, drop zone playlists
blue 100%
favela my favorite kiab
Blue pill but I want to replace Firing Range with Crash
Nuketown
Red pill. I‚Äôm meta on all of these maps
Red
Standoff nuketown highjacked
So basically firing range and terminal vs nuketpwn and standoff ü§î prolly going for firing range and terminal ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Nuketown beats firing range based on its iconic status. Standoff and hijacked come from the best call of duty of all time with the best maps, and while they are both good, standoff plays better overall. Dome beats favela. Terminal does get one point for blue but overall 3-1 RED WINS.
The only good map for red is Nuketown. Blue has 3 nostalgic classics
Red pill is better for sure
red all the way
Unpopular opinion but Nuketown is a terrible map.
Gonna have to go Red man, Dome was my shit. Chaotic as all hell.
My pill is purple‚Ä¶(Nuketown, hijacked, dome, termal)
Blue no questions asked
Stand-off has got to be one of the most underrated maps of all time.
Red pills overrated
you had me at nuketown, but blue clears
1000% blueeee.
REDPILL
Shipment 24/7
Hijacked>
Red is the only correct answer
Nuketown can fuck right off, but still going with the red pill
Looks like I‚Äôm the minority here. I‚Äôm a red pill guy‚Ä¶
Red pill, solely for nuketown and Stand-off. Say what you want about them, hands down my favorite maps of all time. 

The sheer amount of squeakers I'd piss off in SnD on standoff trying to Trick-shot off the tank, with a cross map tomahawk is astounding.
Blue wtf
Blue and it‚Äôs not even close
Red Pill
Nuke town was a cancer that the devs got lazy and brought it back more times than ANYONE asked and crash was the original cancer. But stand-off and dome were top tier. Favela and terminal were god tier. I‚Äôm cut the pill in half ü§£
Bo2 nuketown
Standoff
Dome
Terminal
Red easy
Red
blue pill
Red, literally everything in the blie side is garbage. F*ck that damn ship.
Nucktown and standoff are goats so redpill
purple: 

\-nuketown

\-standoff

\-hijacked

\-favela
Red just cuz it has 2 out of three maps I like. nuketown, crash, and terminal everything else is trash.
Ive never played this game but just looking at the pictures i think the blue pill would be more fun
Red, stand-off and dome are legendary. On the blue side, Favela is one of the worst maps in cod history unless it‚Äôs 9 v 9 domination
Well who says you can't just take both of the pills, why does it always have to be one or the other,
100% blue pill as well
Fuck yeah. Easy blue pill 100%
I broke this all down in my head and was like, why is Dome in Red Pill, it should also be Blue Pilled heavy lol

Off topic but Hijacked SnD spawn tube turned into an every game for sure kill. Scummy but nostalgic now.
    Noob tube across the map ü§£. There were quite a few maps and game types on older COD‚Äôs this could be accomplished!
        In old mw2 I had a class with blast shield and one man army so I always survived the opening tubes.
        None worse Than wet works xD
        Can't forget the nade on Backlot the tube on wasteland
        Yeah but not too many people did it or expected it on Hijacked.
Favela has been my favorite map since it came out. Then terminal is up there, dome, shipment from mw1. 

Either way, it's a solid line up with the firing range on it.
Definitely firing range is my favourite map
I‚Äôm overdosing. I‚Äôd of loved firing range in Cold War or maybe even now in MW3 but in Cold War alone I have easily 4000 games played on Nuketown.
Do people even like crashed? It feels so open.
    I do but It‚Äôs not even close to terminal
        Respectable. I agree terminal being blue side killed this vote.
        The first time I played crash in VR I was floored. Taking advantage of old camping spots and angles against 15 year Olds that had no idea was enough to bring a tear to my eye
            There‚Äôs a specific secret spot in the MW3 version of terminal that makes me feel the same way, in MW2 you can get in the area near the explosive gas tank, but in MW3, the small pipes on the front of the small brick platform with the tank itself and a radiator has collision and can be jumped on, making for an incredible spot to camp in
    It's the only map I nuked on in 2019 and I did it repeatedly. Something is really cheesy about that map
Idk why people like 6v6 rust and Nuketown..

Tiny maps in general...everytime it comes up, its utter chaos and most the players complain how bad the spawn kills are.

It's just weird that ingame I hear complaints, but on forums I hear praise.

It fun for the rarity and novelty (of rust in MW2, it's super rare map). And I'm fine with it...but hear lots of complaints.
    Nuketown actually has structure unlike rust and shipment, both sides spawn at their house and it plays like a normal map only faster. Rust, shipment, and dome don‚Äôt really have that and it‚Äôs more random chaos
    trash players complain and good players enjoy
        Yeah because no casual players want to be killed instantly on spawning. It sucks ass. Great for aholes who remember spawn points and camp
            How do you not know the spawn points on Shipment there's like 5 of them lmao
            then dont play the game mode üòÇ like you clicked on it
Blue is probably the better choice, but Nuketown makes me go red 100%.
    This is exactly my conclusion as well
    Yeah I‚Äôm going red and doing Nuketown only. I‚Äôve been doing basically that since 2015 now anyway
No it is not
Standoff the only good SND map listed
    MW3 Dome hella fun for CTF and decent SND
    Well SND is butt so that might be why
        Agreed snd is fucking boring
        SnD carried multiplayer this game. It‚Äôs not a brainless mode that takes no skill.
            Yea if their was one game the SnD was at its height it‚Äôs gotta be bo2
        POV you're bad at COD
            I personally believe if you want to play snd you should be playing cs.
which is crazy how many people will hate you for not liking SBMM but then would rather play non competitive maps.
RIP favela PC...this is why we should allow non-hacking mods. If developers drop a game, we don't have to
Seek help
    Lmao why
        Because your opinion is different from my opinion..?
    Standoff shits on every single one of these maps combined ten times over and then comes back for seconds
Yes. This is the only way. People saying blue are basic AF.
    I feel like its only reason people are saying blue is because hijacked and terminal. But crash is good. Dome is as good as terminal. Nuke town is better than hijacked. And standoff is imo waaaayyyyyy better than firing range.
        Your logic is sound.
            unsound*
Hard hat is a great map, played half way decent in Mw2019 too imo
Noob tube across the map ü§£. There were quite a few maps and game types on older COD‚Äôs this could be accomplished!
    In old mw2 I had a class with blast shield and one man army so I always survived the opening tubes.
    None worse Than wet works xD
    Can't forget the nade on Backlot the tube on wasteland
    Yeah but not too many people did it or expected it on Hijacked.
I do but It‚Äôs not even close to terminal
    Respectable. I agree terminal being blue side killed this vote.
    The first time I played crash in VR I was floored. Taking advantage of old camping spots and angles against 15 year Olds that had no idea was enough to bring a tear to my eye
        There‚Äôs a specific secret spot in the MW3 version of terminal that makes me feel the same way, in MW2 you can get in the area near the explosive gas tank, but in MW3, the small pipes on the front of the small brick platform with the tank itself and a radiator has collision and can be jumped on, making for an incredible spot to camp in
It's the only map I nuked on in 2019 and I did it repeatedly. Something is really cheesy about that map
