[[i just dodged a blue shell with a mushroom. i didn't even know this was possible!]]





Mushroom as soon as the blue shells spikes aim direct down at you and you’ll always dodge it.
    now the only thing left is to find>! the clitoris!<
        That took an unexpected turn
        I was going to upvote but your upvotes are at 69
            they are at 67 now. go, my child! your mission is clear
    Surprisingly false. The explosion hits you, but you're invincible to it.
        That's called dodging.
        I frames are a dodge hoss
Its actually intentional. When you use a mushroom at the right time, the game actually grants you invincibility from the blue shell. Even if you do smth like mushroom into a wall, you will wont get hit
    Oh damn fr?
        Yup. However, it only applies if the blue shell is targeting you. If someone else is being targeted and you mushroom, you’ll get hit regardless
            ah, a fellow Shortcat viewer
            You can even dodge the blue shell by collecting the small boost from someone else's revolving mushroom too.
    Even with the half pipe boost that grants you flames, it doesn't work according to Shortcat.
Yep, when you have a mushroom, you use it as soon as you see the spikes of the Blue shell AIM DOWN, trust me, (without sounding dramatic) it took me years to finally get the timing down of that cuz I couldn’t for the life of me avoid them using a mushroom, and now I’m spreading that little nugget of wisdom towards you and everyone else that doesn’t know 🤓🧠
    i'd definitely tried to do this before and failed, but i will absolutely be trying it again now that i know it works. thanks for the info!
        NP at all OP, it just takes practice and you’ll get it in no time, btw this is the video I used to help practice, hold it helps: https://youtube.com/shorts/g1pFTBOL8Wg?si=OH86RPLn2K3yE5dQ 😁

I thought this was common knowledge. Cool though
    i'd seen youtube videos, never done it myself. i wasn't sure if they were faked, but i do play plenty of 200cc since im using all the gold parts. the time trials are pretty hard, so i don't have the gold wheels yet though. this one and most of my games are 150cc, and i've tried to do this before and failed
        The gold parts are pretty shitty tbh, you're better off using different parts, or the meta builds people use online
            im aware that they suck. it's more of a prestige thing for me. the only tangible benefit of the gold parts is that they have higher underwater speed than average, but they otherwise have almost the same stats as the standard kart that they are a reskin of.
                I gotcha. I just thought you were having a hard time with the time trials and figured I'd mention it in case you didn't already know
                    yep, understood and thanks
            Ngl this is why the game is so unfun to play online. "Meta builds" like no build is inherently better than the next. It's the skill. Stats matter but not by much. People with the worst stats possible have still won races. Idk why people keep saying builds suck when it isn't true 💀💀
                I'm definitely not an expert on all things meta, but I do know the meta waluigi build has a valid reason. The kart combo has a secret stat that gives you the highest micro boosts, and the hitbox is marginally smaller, making you just a little harder to hit.

Of course, you can win with any kart combo. The majority of the game is skill based, but at the highest level of any competitive game, any micro advantage is worth it. Same reason pro gamers use mechanical keyboards, high sensitivity mice, and high refresh rate monitors. It makes a difference.

The meta build in Mario Kart won't ever guarantee a win, it just gives you a slight advantage. But the higher your online score, the more you'll see meta builds
If you didn't know why did you use the mushroom there tho 😭
    right. hastily written title. i knew about the trick, but i had never seen it proven before and had sort of assumed the videos i saw were faked.
    You can tell that they were kind of mashing L when the Spiny Shell reached them
        yes, i didn't word the post very well. i've seen this done on youtube, but i didn't know if it was real footage until it happened to me. i would be mashing L regardless, because the race was almost over and i needed to use the mushrooms as soon as the shell wore off if i did get hit.
Blue shells have been dodge-able with mushrooms since Mario Kart Wii. (They have been dodgeable since DS technically, but only through a well-timed mini-turbo on 150cc speeds).
I raise you this [How To Dodge A Blue Shell With A Blue Shell](https://youtu.be/FIqmjNbNCyQ?si=sIaWb57i1_09oPhY)
    oh my
I've managed to pull that off once. But it's also rare for me to have a mushroom in 1st, so I don't get many opportunities to try. I usually just end hoarding horns to protect me instead.
Welcome to the pros 😎
Knew about this myself.

Very funny story from the original Wii U game: I was playing solo on a GP, and a Spiny was soaring in on me, and I just hit an Item Box, so I was frantically spamming the L button while it was rouletting, and it stopped on a Mushroom at the exact time I needed it to boost away from utter annihilation. Just a wild moment I couldn't happened as well as it did.
Ok but did you ever dodge a blue with a boost panel? I did
You live you learn
Perfect for when I run into all those mushroom boxes in first place
    :3
Ah, what I would give to be at this level of naïveté once more
    i've always been more of a diddy kong racer, but this version of mario kart is superior until someone decides to actually release a dkr sequel.
Actually I’ve just recently learned that myself
