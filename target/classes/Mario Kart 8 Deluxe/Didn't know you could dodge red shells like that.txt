[[Didn't know you could dodge red shells like that]]


Happened to me when playing with friends


"Hey guys check it out, i dodged a bullet!"
The nuke behind him:

(In all seriousness this is cool)
Yea, if you can manage to change direction really quick when itâ€™s in its final approach, it will get confused and pass you. 

You can also bump/drive just right next to a wall when itâ€™s super close and it will break on the wall.
    Your bump method is cool and works. This works and is cooler.
That nice, but what about that blue one?

Blue shell jumpscare
Red shell just didnt wanna get blue shelled
In double dash you could dodge a blue shell with just a blue mini turbo and good timing
    Same on MKDS. Idk about DD but in DS itâ€™s a 1 frame window on 150cc
        I think double dash it depends on your kart I think. It stops tracking you when it divebombs so you need to get out of range between when it starts moving down and when it hits the ground, but how fast you can do that is different and some karts probably can't do it at all
    ...double dash only has a blue mini turbo
The blue shell:

Ladies & Gentlemen, we have found our magnum opus.
I thought he was ultra instinct until I saw the blue guy
Bruh you dodged the red shell like the one time when you'd wanna get hit by it.
The red shell didnâ€™t need to outrun the blue shell. It just needed to outrun *you*
Blue shell thought he was playing
Nice! Interestingly though, you could have maybe let the red hit you, and then the Blue might not have damaged you thanks to invincibility frames...can't tell for sure w/ the timing from the angle in the replay. ðŸ¤ 
you could rarely get outta red shells in double dash
Bruh the blue shell after the save is DEVASTATING
Blue shell: you think it would be that easy?
*get put into at least 5th place*
