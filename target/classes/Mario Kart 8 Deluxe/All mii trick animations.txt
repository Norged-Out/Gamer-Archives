[[All mii trick animations]]





I don't even know what to say about that last one ðŸ’€
    NNN Is hardðŸ’€
        "Lord have mercy, we must stay focused brothers"
    peachette's bike outfit...
Dafuq was the cow one?
    Nintendo trying to make us lose NNN. They didn't get me though!
The Goomba one looks so weird and I love it
These look so goofy I love it
oh i love the blooper mii suit
woulda been kinda funny if they made a coin pop out of the block one then quickly disappear
I wonder how some of these (especially the chain chomp and goomba) look from the front

P.S. amiibos?
    These are all free with the booster course pass except for the Daisy outfit which you need the amiibo for.
        damn it
        I knew that much, I was wondering if any of the amiibo suits have unique animations. Iâ€™m gonna guess you got all of them since I actually didnâ€™t realize they Daisy suit is from an amiibo
What was that last one lmaooo ðŸ’€
    Bro, that cow is making expired milk from that one
so no one's gonna talk about how the chain chomp tries to jumpscare you
how do u unlock these??
    You get them instantly with the Booster Course Pass!
I use cow mii suit and pretend my mii is Minion from Twisted Metal Black in an alternative distorted timeline
I like how the bowser one copies browser's trick animation, nice detail
I wonder if Daisy has new tricks
This makes me wonder, do the amiibo costumes all have their own animations too?
The cow one-
Wtf did Goomba do ;-;
Was the cow one a mod or am I stupid
    Itâ€™s real
