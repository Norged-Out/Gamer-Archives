[[What do you recon will happen to Palworld Temporary hype or longterm potential]]


I‚Äôm really thinking about grabbing this game following the positive reviews on steam. I can see alot of potential long term aslong as the devs stick with it and continue to innovate the concept.


If you like ARK it‚Äôs a good fit. If you like Pok√©mon it‚Äôs a good fit. If you like Conan Exiles it‚Äôs a good fit. If you like all of those games it‚Äôs a perfect fit!
    I wonder if they‚Äôll go the ARK route where they release new maps with different terrain and maybe even different pals
        I'd rather have them improve already big map and add to it. There's plenty of empty space if they want to add land.
            I‚Äôm looking at you massive tree I can‚Äôt reach
                I was so sad when I hit the red wall üò¢

I had a good thirty seconds of denial. I was like "maybe I just need to come from a different angle"

Then I finally accepted the truth that I would not get to the tree
                    You can go "over" the red wall but then there's another invisible barrier thats a bit closer to the tree
                        Fun fact. Technically its not an other invisible barrier, its the collision of the tree.
The fect that pocket pair uses unreal engine 5.1 for palworld and the default collision for a imported model is a  "simple"  collision  what that does is it is looking at the form of the model and than make a collision barrier around the full model fromfrom top to bottom.
But it the gonna set the collision to " use  complex collision" it would look at the model and based on the polygons of the model its would be the same for the collision.
So its really just the model collision and not a invisible barrier 

But i think the devs didn't predict that the players still could find a way to go over it. 

Still a good place to make a farming base as i did  its mostly flat and no other pals or raids comming there
                    I, too, tried to go around it. For a good minute I went along the red wall, hoping there would be a way in‚Ä¶
                I will never forget the sound in my friends voice when I told him he was not going to reach the tree, about 3 seconds before he hit the wall.
                Praise the Erdtree
                There is hint In the opening scene something will be done with that tree
            The bottom right corner of the map seems fit for a few new islands and a max level bump.
                There's been talk that the portion available to us is part of a big chain of islands surrounding the big tree in the distance. Could possibly up the level cap, and introduce new islands with new pals that way
                    On that note the devs said they‚Äôre planning for 4 major releases, which would correspond to the 3 other corners and the island of the big tree itself
                        Hope one of those updates includes a huge underground system
                    They have already stated new Islands would be coming
                    The big tree concept sounds super intriguing, like it could be a central hub connecting these islands, and maybe each island has its own unique ecosystem? That'd keep things fresh and give a reason to explore, more than just a level cap incentive. Plus, imagine if each new island came with its own set of challenges or environmental hazards to survive.
                        That's what I'm hoping, something different environmentally as well as the pals that'll spawn

Considering what they put out to start with, I do have hope they could give us something exciting with new islands and such
                        >That'd keep things fresh

So what you're saying is that right now we are in Kanto, soon there will be Johto and eventually Hoenn, Sinnoh, Unova and (checks notes...) _Paldea_.
                According to game code, level isn't hard capped until 80 but it's currently blocked at 50. So there is at least a plan to go to 80 at the moment.
                    At 10 level increments. Primary release to 50. 3 expansion releases at 10 levels a piece.
                        Would make sense too, I really don‚Äôt see the next update suddenly adding lvl 80 pals (and the next updates 100/140)
                        In a year or 2 mabye
                    I feel like they need to add more requirements for leveling after 50 too. Like to get to 60 you need xp and a certain amount of your paldex filled out or something just to make it a little harder to max out
                I'd rather that be changed into water focused zone, but everything else I agree with.  


I'd like to have to ride a pal with "surf" in order to get out there and then use a pal with "dive" in order to breach the water and explore and catch deep sea pals.
                    I get what you‚Äôre saying but flying mounts kind of make that unnecessary. I still would like them to add that kind of stuff as an option. Underwater areas would be so cool. They could even add scuba gear.
                        There are possible lore accurate ways to prevent flying in certain places to make use of other kinds of mechanics
                            I think that would be a bad move personally
                                Don't want caves or underwater bioms?
                                    I do but I still want the option to fly over water. Maybe I misunderstood
                            Tbh they should just make your flying pal go back into its ball if they ‚Äúland‚Äù over water while mounted in order to make water pals more useful
                                Not from just landing on water, but maybe if they run out of stamina and fall onto water.
                        Eh, the way the stamina system works with flying mounts, it's more efficient to just take a water mount that doesn't drain stam when in the water for long ocean trips, then switch once you make landfall, rather than starting out with a flyer and having to take frequent rest stops
                        If there's a water mount that surfs faster than flying mounts then they would be viable
                        Flying mounts do make you descend every once in a while which is kind of annoying and a different experience than a water mount, which I'd definitely like.
            JUST LET ME GO TO THE TREE!¬†
                You can "get" to the tree and go past the wall, but there's nothing there. It's currently set dressing.

But that tree is definitely important. All the skill fruits grow on trees seemingly made of paldium. All the dungeon final rooms have a larger tree that is similar to the skill fruit trees.

I have a feeling that big tree is the source of the paldium, the origin of the pals, and likely will be the finale of the planned updates.
                    I think it even says as much in the journals or in some of the item flavor text. Something about the energy from the tree making palladium and it's carried through the water which is why all the small palladium rocks spawn by oceans/rivers
                        Great, there goes who knows how many hours searching out the journals.
            YES. LET ME GO TO THE TREE.   
WE YEARN FOR THE TREE.
            I saw someone post an idea where they expand the map with the big tree as the center and the current map is only a quarter of the whole thing. This is now what I hope will happen.
            Based on one analysis somewhere in this sub Reddit, the current map takes up a potential 25% of the total area
            Big map???????????????

I‚Äôve already explored about 70-80% of the map‚Ä¶ the frozen zones are the only places I haven‚Äôt been‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm around lvl 25-30.

Hit 90 of 111 Pals‚Ä¶

Best pretty much all the Pal Bosses up to level 30‚Ä¶

Beat Zoe‚Ä¶ the only boss I‚Äôve fought so far‚Ä¶

Setup a mining operation with Anubis x5, Verdash x3, a water type and a Shadowbesk to haul materials to the chests‚Ä¶

And I‚Äôm bored with it‚Ä¶
        I think that is for a few years time minimum tbh as currently alot of the map is filler.

Not hating ofc as I love the game, but when I first saw how big the map was I was mad impressed, but now I've explored it all I would say about 60% of the larger map is just filler to be there, with no real structures or locations to make it unique
            That‚Äôs what I noticed to, all these ‚Äústructures‚Äù, but they are just scenery.
                Being pre release they can easily work on density as well as expanding.

The map is beautiful,  just lacking in content and story in it.  Even just bumping the spawn rate to 3x makes the world feel so much more alive.
        That'd be a LOT of work for such a small team, but I think they said they plan on adding new islands with some new pals
            not like wildcard was a huge team when they started making ark, were they? palworld has practically unlimited budget right now, i think they could afford to expand the team a little and hire some more artists/map designers if that's truly what they wanted to do. I think most people would prefer them to just add on to the current map though, maybe have a loading screen to a new "region" or something after taking a boat where it's essentially a new map, assuming they can't just keep expanding the existing single map because of performance reasons.
                There was a rumor that the giant tree would become the true center of a bigger map and your be able to select which region around the tree you'd wanna spawn
                    this would be very cool
                sadly wildcard bit more than they could chew and it blew up in their faces
                    wildcard made truly awful decisions one after another even after getting bailed out numerous times. im expecting ark 2 to be some kind of singleplayer only game, or at least heavily narrative based. it just seems so odd to me they're spending all this time making ARK: SA when ARK 2 is supposedly coming out this year. they're gonna have two competing games in the same franchise confusing new players. why they wouldn't just keep making ARK 2 until it's done I don't know, maybe they desperately needed a cash infusion or maybe I'm right and it's not gonna be a pvp survivalcraft at all.
                        Because a huge percentage of the ark player base has absolutely zero interest in a third person only arksouls conan evolved game. People just wanted ark to work properly and be playable. Unfortunately ASA is the same turd as ASE except this turd has been rolled in glitter.
                            i mean, tons of people play ark in third person. i'm not making any definitive assumptions on gameplay until we see gameplay footage or their marketing ramps up.
                        Well, ARK 2 is going to be nothing like ARK: SA, ARK 2 is a souls like narrative driven game and will be almost an entirely different game from ARK: SA, the only thing that will link ARK 2 to the original ARKs will be the lore and dinosaurs

The reason they made ARK: SA was to please fans of ARK: SE Since most of us didn‚Äôt want a souls like version of ARK, we wanted regular ARK
                            Are you sure about that? I don't think they ever said anywhere ARK 2 *wouldn't* be survival craft, but they said it would have more soulsy on-foot combat, which doesn't mean a survival craft is dead. But idk.
                                Well im sure its gonna still have survival crafting, but last I checked they were focusing on 3rd person souls like exploration/combat which is absolutely different than what we have in ARK:SE/A Which is unique
            They have enough money to hire at least 10/20 devs/designers lol
                Also, Microsoft will be bankrolling them. They want this to become their Mario/Poke/GOW
                    Indoubtedly
                100 / 200
                They already have 14 programmers and 5 game designers, for reference.
        There‚Äôs plenty of room on the map to add to and infinite possibilities for new pals, I don‚Äôt see why they wouldn‚Äôt after they get farther through their road map
        I know this isn't a commonly held opinion, but I'd love procedurally generated worlds as an option. Don't ditch the handmade map, but it would be interesting to play different games that have new randomized worlds and randomized pal spawn areas.
        That‚Äôs on their roadmap actually!
        I really hope they expand with more maps or areas. Other than just reworking dungeons every now and again.
        From what The devs somewhat implied, now take it with a grain of salt, is that they're going to add other islands. Now, I saw a YouTuber make a theory that the islands are going to kind of circle around the giant tree in the middle of the map. It would make a perfect full circle, make an absolutely gargantuan map, and give them plenty of new space to add plenty of new biomes, story areas, new pals, new features and functions to fit these new areas, and so much more. And maybe eventually they will add the central tree area to be a playable area. That would be awesome to build a base and its branches way up high
    This game turned me from a ‚Äúthis looks okay, I guess I‚Äôll try it‚Äù to a ‚Äúyoooo I gotta get on Palworld and plan my next moves‚Äù type of person. It definitely surprised me. It‚Äôs early access but I truly hope they work out some kinks and nuances, as well as add more to the game. I see it having more potential than it seems and I enjoy this way more than Craftopia (another game this company developed)
        Very much the same. I'm routinely sitting playing other games and think "shit. I want to play Palworld."
            Yeah my backlog went even further because I‚Äôve been playing this like crazy
    I think you could add Animal Crossing and Breath of the Wild to that list too
        True
        And a dash of Elden Ring
    I am not sure if it is a good fit for purely Pokemon fans. It is a very different game after all
        Hi! Gigantic Pokemon fan here. Palworld improves on the Pokemon formula in every way except IV breeding. I love this game, excited to see what it looks like with more development.

For more context, I love Conan exiles, elden ring, and factorio, but never really liked ARK at all.

Edit: Some of you think I used 'IV' as a replacement for 'for'. lol. I realize not everyone is familiar with breeding in pokemon. IV stands for [Individual Value](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Individual_values) and is a mostly hidden stat boost to a monsters base stats.
            I think the biggest appeal to palworld for Pokemon fans (including myself) is that palworld plays like the Pokemon games have always described the world, even though we never really experienced it in those games.

The Pokemon games always talked about how people lived and worked alongside Pokemon, but we only got to battle. The games talked about how dangerous Pokemon were without your own to defend yourself from them, but you always had one. The games talked about how evil and exploitative criminal organizations were without in any way describing how they could be. (to be fair on this point, palworld doesn't really show the syndicates engage in exploitation either, but the actions available to the player do a good job of filling in the blanks, should you go that route) There's a lot of dark themes hinted at in Pokemon games as well, but it's always got that Disney candy-coating on top that keeps it from ever actually feeling significant.

In a lot of ways, Palworld simply delivers on the *promise* Pokemon games have been giving us for years without following through.
                Totally agree. Pokemon games only ever touch on the dark side through pokedex entries or text. You almost never really see the brutal side of a pokemon world.
                    This is why I loved Legends Arceus so much, it started dipping its toes into the darker side, like the casual mention of Pokemon wanting to murder you. But then they threw that away with scarlet and violet, and Legends only just barely dipped its toes in. Palworld just dove head first into the darkness
                        Doesn‚Äôt Palworld‚Äôs reminds you quite a bit of arceus? It definitely made me go hmmmmm
                            Literally the only relation it has is that it's cute creatures caught in balls and it's open world. Totally different concept otherwise if you ask me. The similarities are numerous but it's really not as similar as alot of people say. (I'll admit I've accidentally called some pals by the Pokemon they look similar to
                Such a good way of putting it
            How do you feel about the pal vs pal combat out of curiosity? Despite how much I love this game I think the AI is one of the game‚Äôs biggest weaknesses and I actually do not feel this was an improvement. 

Not saying they can‚Äôt potentially fix and improve the combat AI, but it‚Äôs a little frustrating seeing my Anubis stumped by object permanence when he runs into a pillar during a tower fight. I‚Äôm also not holding my breath on the combat AI being fixed because I think that‚Äôs one of the more difficult challenges to tackle and they haven‚Äôt mentioned it being a priority to my knowledge.
                Honestly its pretty fucking boring without greater control over your pals who cant be mounted. I'm not really excited for pvp until combat is improved from a competetive standpoint.

In terms of fulfilling a monster-tamer fantasy? It meets the mark, and has a leg up on pokemon as you can use many many more monsters as mounts, and even mounted combat
                I think simply adding a 4th move and the option to select which move they use via the radial wheel where you pet and choose aggro would do wonders for this. I'd be kind of surprised if they're not working in the ai, though considering that's a huge complaint of the community and pocket pair seems to listen well.
                    I personally wouldn‚Äôt even necessarily be frustrated with them if they couldn‚Äôt fix it. It would go a long way toward making the game a better experience but npc AI seems to be something even AAA studios struggle with sometimes. 

I don‚Äôt know what all they‚Äôre working with, but if they keep putting out content and fixing what they can I‚Äôll be coming back. That just happens to be the biggest item on my wishlist.
                >How do you feel about the pal vs pal combat out of curiosity?

honestly its pretty bad right now, The bigger pals are janky as fuck, and their moves are even more janky. The AI is also pretty bad. Hopefully it gets fixed in the future
            Im ngl ark did the ‚Äò‚Äôark‚Äô‚Äô style survival so bad its not even funny

Conan is a slight bit better but still overall suffers from the same issues ark does but palworld however took that style further and improved on it hard
                All I ever did in conan was tame animals and use them for all my combat anyway haha
            Gigantic pokemon fan here too. I love palworld but I think it's dumb to compare the two. For a start pokemon is conditional turn based which opens the door whereas palworld has no strategy, just shoot
                When my level 25 tanzie is fighting a mammoth, there is definitely strategy. Lol
                Pokemon hasn't evolved that formula in 20 years. All it took was a team to make the pokemon game people wanted from Nintendo for years and it sold like wildfire.
                    I love Pal world. They did a lot of great things.

What they did not do is deliver a strategy game; and pokemon very much is. Lots of mind games with the team you bring to a rank match, because you don‚Äôt use all of them; the switches you make mid battle to try to gain a type advantage; the move selection you choose and the type coverage it offers.

And I will **always** prefer evolutions on my creature collectors. I don‚Äôt really like having 2 pals that are clearly related. I don‚Äôt care about world building, I care about how I used my pengullet for 20 levels: I don‚Äôt want to capture a new penking, I want my pengullet to evolve

Palworld **changed** and then improved on Pok√©mon. I still want the open world ‚Äúpokemon‚Äù game too. I‚Äôm greedy sure; but I know Nintendo is too

Edit: ‚Äútiming‚Äù does not equal ‚Äústrategy‚Äù. palworld has zero strategy involved. It‚Äôs an action game where we can use actions to time switches to gain a benefit. But there is no ‚Äúshould I try to dodge, or should I face tank it‚Äù. You should try to dodge.

Double edit: I forgot this sub is full of children who have to go ‚ÄúAcTuAlY‚Äù to every little thing. Thank you for giving me the push to leave the sub
                        If you try facing enemy's 5 levels above you, strategy, assigned attacks and subbing out are very much a thing as your guns do literally 9-11 damage per hit. I'm not to fussed on evolutions myself, as most are unique enough to not seem related in the way you draw lines between pokemon lineage.
                            Pulling Pals defensively to avoid attacks is also something to be mindful of during a fight.
                            I would claim that ‚ÄúSubbing‚Äù in this game is not a ‚Äústrategy‚Äù. All you think is ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to get hit better recall my pal‚Äù. It‚Äôs a test of your timing skill, not your critical thinking skill

While Subbing in pokemon is deciding to give your opponent an immediate benefit, so that you can gain a future benefit; that is strategy
                                Eh, it's still boiling back to live vs turn based, in a live pokemon battle you also wouldn't have time to map a strategy like you do in turnbased, it's tennis vs chess.

Edit: not sure why you blocked me after last reply but OK lol
                                    
Then open world pokemon game will still be turn based, just like Arcues/Scarlet/violet‚Ä¶what‚Äôs your point?

Edit: I blocked them for continuing to change what I am trying to talk about and ignoring what I was saying‚Ä¶.this wasn‚Äôt a discussion it was the other user talking at me.

Edit for the person below; I hope you get the help you need friend ‚ù§Ô∏è
                        Turn based combat is a very heavy mechanic in pokemon, but I dont really see it as a defining feature at all and is incredibly boring and dated imho
                            bro turn based combat is like, a hallmark of many s-tier rpg's lol. that's like saying fps is boring and dated because its a heavy mechanic in doom/wolfenstein. (for the record i'm not dissing you for disliking turn based combat, i see what you're getting at)
                                I don't think they were saying that turn-based combat ***in general*** is boring and dated, but rather that ***Pokemon's*** turn-based combat is boring and dated... which is accurate, IMO. They really haven't changed it all that much from the original Pokemon games.
                                    Mmm fair point lol. Pokemon‚Äôs rigid formula is incredibly stale and I haven‚Äôt fully played through one since sword/shield, which i found exceedingly disappointing
                                    Because it's a solid system and doesn't have to change. If you e played competitive pokemon you'll see that pokemons turn based gameplay is actually very intense, turn by turn reads and plays are wild. If you're into chess and card games, competitive pokemon would be right up your alley. 

What the games need are better stories, better AI, and higher difficulty. And even then, the latest DLC actually gave us an entire zone where every battle was a double battle with the NPCs using real items and strats, they're getting there finally.
                            Turn based combat as a whole will never be ‚Äúdated‚Äù what are you smoking? 

People care about their joints; we can‚Äôt just play button smashing action games all the time. That‚Äôs how you get carpal tunnel
                                I don't mind turn based combat in abstract 2d games but with the modern 3d style of new pokemon games it's pathetic
                                    Why?

Edit: *is it ‚Äúpathetic‚Äù*
                            Lol there is a global level tournament for pokemon battling, it is the basis of how the card game works, it's what the anime is based on, it is the core gameplay system of the series for almost 30 years...


How is that NOT a defining feature? You can think it's boring and you're welcome to your opinion but it's a silly stance to take as truth. Is chess boring? Hasn't changed its gameplay in actual centuries yet it's still the most recognized boardgame/strategy game in the world? Is LoL boring for not having changed its gameplay in the 15 years since its release?

YOU might not care for it and that's a fine opinion to have, same as I don't care for shooters. But let's not live in our own mental canon where mainline pokemon games ARENT DEFINED by their turn based strategy elements. That's like saying main Mario games arent defined by their platforming elements. It's a silly take.

It's not boring, it's not dated. It's actually very intense, takes a lot of practice and game knowledge to be good at and has a rich strategic elements. Again you don't have to love it but calling it boring and dated is like calling chess boring and dated.
                    "The game people wanted", no, think what you might like, most fans *don't* want something edgy or over the top like Palworld.
                        You can deny it as long as you want, but the majority of people who bought it love pokemon and are keen to see the more adult pokemon world, meanwhile pokemon still tries to sanitise the whole enslaving creatures to cockfight aspect.
                            Or majority bought it for the memes and don't engage in the vocal group that say "THIS IS WHAT POKEMON SHOULD BE LIKE"
                                Like I said feel, free to deny it as long as you want
                PalWorld isn‚Äôt like the Pok√©mon GAMES. PalWorld is like how the world of Pok√©mon is actually described by GameFreak and even the anime.
                "Just shoot" is the same take as "Just press A" in turn-based games. 

Palworld has more skill expression than Pokemon, it just doesn't matter with the current game state because there's no reason to do it.
                    More things in common with Pokemon in a way lol. There's lots of knowledge and skill expression in Pokemon that very few ever even touch because the base game doesn't challenge you enough.
                Gigantic Pok√©mon fan here. Pok√©mon was never good because of the battle system. But for the team building and fun world. Palworld just improves that by alot
                    Gigantic Pokemon fan here. Team building only matters because of the battle system. The fun world is only an additional part. You remove the battle system, and it stops feeling like Pokemon and just feels like chaos.

Palworld is entirely different because of this. There‚Äôs no strategy. You can actually return your Pals as a move is hitting them to prevent damage and then send them back out. Typings don‚Äôt matter cause any Pal can learn any type move and STAB is negligible compared to other passives.
                        Eh. I've played multiple Pok√©mon games where I shot through with the same team for pretty much the entire game, ignoring the battle system.
                            This is my beef with a lot of the newer Pokemon games tbh. Ever since they turned the exp share on permanently, you don‚Äôt really even have to try anymore for the most part. 

There are some good mods and stuff out there though where strategy is definitely still very important. And that does make for a much more engaging experience imo. 

I do love both Pokemon and Palworld but I agree that they give different vibes - at least when Pokemon is done right or is at a competitive level.
                                You never really needed to use more than one pokemon. You could just overlevel one pokemon and then keep the rest as revive sacrifices.
                        its better than pokemon just deal with it they did what hey should have done palsworld should partner with digimon for their first cosmetic drop
                        That's the thing. Team building in palworld doesn't just revolve around the battling. You have to consider traversal, resource gathering and the environment and time of day. Not to mention the whole base team. If the battle system was the most important thing in Pok√©mon how come the anime, the card game, pokken, mystery dungeon, snap etc still feels like Pok√©mon

There is a lot of strategy. Tho the strategy is different. You have to think more on your feet. There isn't a pause to give you time to plan. Typings matter arguably more than in Pok√©mon because of the simplified type chart..
                            There really isn't a lot of strategy. Game is piss easy, which isn't a bad thing, but you can go guns blazing and succeed more often than not lol



Half the stuff you listed is a bit of a reach. Traversal options don't require strategy. It boils down to use flier or use ground mount. Thats it. 


Hell, you can completely ignore type advantages and still win. It won't even be difficult.
                        >Palworld is entirely different because of this. There‚Äôs no strategy.

Pokemons strategy is exclusively type countering, pokemon also has potions which completely negate using any strategy. Which is fine because the game is designed that way.

Theres a reason why every pokemon game, if you exclusively use your starter you will go through every bad type match up gym completely out leveling them. Not to mention types don't even matter when you can learn adjacent type abilities.
                            This was basically my strat as a kid. Went through every generation up to platinum just using my starter to burst through everything. 

Strategy: grass type? Charizard. Flying type? Charizard water type? Charizard

Except Fire Red, where I was possessed by the rat spirit and went through the game with 2 Rattata that never evolved.
                        So do you like Palworld still or not really. Genuine question.
                        Well by that logic Pokemon has no strategy either. You can steamroll through with just one move ignoring type altogether as long as you level a single mon enough. And that's exactly how I played it when I was a kid
                        I agree! By now I've played Palworld to level 45 with a bunch of friends, beating every single tower boss but Victor/Shadowbeak and capturing every single Alpha pal available. The combat system is fine for as long as shooting up bullets and rockets into pocket monsters seem funny to you. Gets boring really fast, specially if you're hoping to find any tactical approach. It all boils down to variance and design space.

It could be easily remedied by increasing the relevancy of Pal/move types and Unique Abilities. Something easily done and worked on given enough time to playtest and refine. 

For reference: 
ON POK√âMON Type advantage may go up to 4x or 400% move damage. 
Disadvantage may go down to 0.25x or 25% or even 0 (Type immunity)
STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) adds 50% of a move's power to its total power before calculation if it has the same typing as the user.

ON PALWORLD type advantage may go up to 1.4x or 140% move damage. That's 260% less upwards variance than pok√©mon.
Disadvantage goes down to 0.6x or 60% move damage. That's 45% less downwards variance than pok√©mon, 60% less if you consider the lack of immunity in Palworld. (although these numbers might not be precise, they might actually err to less)
STAB on Palworld also adds only 20% to a move's power before damage calc. (confirmed value) That's 30% less impactful than pok√©mon.

The result is a dumbed down version of the pok√©mon battle system requiring little care for choice and variance. Since its conception, pok√©mon gym leaders employ monotype team compositions SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED to give the player an edge by growing a cast with flexible offensive options, instead of grinding your head into a wall.

On Palworld, you can hop on a Ragnahawk or Pyrin with 4 Gobfin on bench and breeze your way through the ENTIRE game. Alternatively, dark-type Nocturnal Pyrin, Frostallion Noct, Helzephyr, Maraith or Nox (These all do the exact same thing. Really, search it up.) and the same Gobfin setup would work. You can easily optimize Palworld by having monotype teams, or teams entirely dedicated to boosting player attack and defense. Which is fine and dandy if it were only an option, and not the playstyle you're forced to take.


Some pok√©mon are allowed to have busted 600 total stats by possessing typing that's disadvantageous to common attacks in the game, such as Mega Scizor, Genesect, Kommo-o, Tyranitar. Alternatively even weak 500 stats are made battle viable through a combination of synergistic typing+ability, such as Eelektross, Spiritomb and Shedinja, having either no weaknesses or being immune to most offensive moves.

On Palworld, none of this would even matter, since damage variance on typing is negligible and there is no immunity for some reason. It's simply damage % stacking upon damage. You can just mash numbers against a wall and it will break, and that's the most if not only viable strategy. This implies a greatly limited design space and variety. New additions to the game will only have bigger and bigger stats with higher damage moves, since that's the only way to make Pals relevant. The current system is made to be powercrept when it could be so much more.

It doesn't help that there is a grand variety of 137 Pals counting environmental variants, with 75% of the "unique" Abilities providing one thing and one thing only: % damage boost. no immunity to anything (such as Lightning Rod or Flash Fire). no speed boost. no speeding up cast time. no conditions to acquire higher stats (such as Guts or Moxie). no applying negative effects (such as Intimidate). no weather effects (such as Sandstream, Drought, Drizzle, etc you get the gist.) Just pure unconditional damage increase. Basically all battle-oriented pals have fucking Huge Power and you can mount on them sometimes. Even then, the most exquisite mount abilities such as active rocket launchers and firethrowers actually just suck, they're extremely underwhelming: completely defeating the purpose of the game's "rule of cool". Seriously think about how cool would be a Pal with weather altering abilities, bringing upon a rain or thunderstorm when it's summoned. Instead we have "Generic Partner Skill Name #78: Boost type damage". or "Generic Partner Skill Name #110: Apply type damage".
                            You competely ignore the fact that in virtually every Pok√©mon game, you can literally get through the entire game if you just use your starter the entire time. Many people point out this is what they did as a kid, myself included. Pok√©mon games require no tactical approach unless you actively introduce it yourself (something I unconsciously started doing myself on later runs/games by purposely swapping out my starter).
                            TL;DR: Palworld is very simplified and basic in combat design (active/passive/unique skills & typings) meaning there‚Äôs very little strategy, even in team building.

You got me with the ‚ÄúBasically all battle-oriented mons have fucking huge power.‚Äù I never saw it like that until you pointed it out.

I also realized that, because any Pal can learn any move, any meta will always boil down to having multiple of the same Pal on your team. Let‚Äôs say you don‚Äôt care about unique skills, Pal A has the highest base attack stat in the game. You would want to use Pal A in multiple forms because STAB doesn‚Äôt matter and move pools don‚Äôt matter. Why would you use Pal B with a lower base attack stat when Pal A does literally the same thing (again, ignoring Unique Skills)? I don‚Äôt think the unique skills are good enough for you to pass up Pal A for Pal B.
                            A very in depth explanation of why this game is too easy.
                How exactly do you look at the Pal spheres, and the "collect em all" gameplay and NOT think Pokemon?
                    I think they are saying that the *gameplay* of the two games aren't easy to compare. The aesthetics are a ripe comparison, yes.
                What if palworld added optional turn-based mode. Would that be possible and has any game done that?
            Dude I hated ark there was high level dinosaurs in the starting area that I got spawn killed by every time I tried to get my loot bag
                Yup, sounds like Ark. I love Ark, but I doubt I'd love it if I didn't love dinosaurs. Shit is a nightmare very often. 


And that's before the inevitable bugs.
            Lets wait on judging IVs until we see competitive.  If competitive works around IVs then IVs are not a problem because they would only be an optional carrot you dont need to have.  If people are stressing about IVs without competitive just for the PVE.....that's not a game problem that's a them problem.    


Ain't no content in the game hard enough to require min/maxed IVs.  Also playing around IVs if you wish to is not 100 or 0.  You can easily just say "anything top 20% of IVs is good enough.
            > in every way except IV breeding

I understand why some people like this part of pokemon and other games, but honestly I wish games like this would step *away* from the eugenics grind. It's such a monotonous grind and it feels really bad to me to have a creature/partner that I've been training/raising since the start of the game become obsolete because its great*9 grandchild rolled better stats and passives. Makes it pointless to become attached to anything or care about investing resources in anything until you have whatever broken legend/x/x/x combo
                Hard agree, the IVs part of the stat system should have been left at the soul infusions and not another hidden stat tacked on under the hood. Thank fuck there arent EVs, although I guess condensing and souls are tantamount
            It's missing the rpg element by quite a bit though. At the moment it's just a big sandbox survival.
            Ark had an amazing concept but the devs fucked it up and the game had a lot of inconsistency‚Äôs that weren‚Äôt fixed until too late
            There are IVs in palworld
                Yes, and they're saying Palworld didn't improve on it.
            Really? Palworld improves on pokemon turn based monster battle? Cause I haven‚Äôt seen anything like that in palworld
                I would hardly say turn based combat is a unique experience for pokemon, not at all what I think of when I say 'the pokemon formula'
            Not at all, I don‚Äôt see any evolutionary or shiny pals nowhere, I don‚Äôt see a good story anywhere here, the games are separate experiences and should be treated as such
                I think the vast majority would disagree just because they dont evolve or come in a slightly different shade of purple... the overlap in core game mechanics is quite enough to justify a comparison
            The way you used ‚ÄúIV‚Äù bothers me despite it being cunning. Take a upvote

Edit: I forgot to say leave my presence.
                What about it bothers you? I didnt use it as a replacment for 'for'. It stands for Initial Value, which is a hidden boost to base stats and a breeding mechanic that exists in both pokemon and palworld. Historically it has been a pain in the ass to find out what these values are for newly hatched pokemon, but recently they have made it incredibly accessible. If palworld wants to keep the system, I think its best to make them visible to players without the use of calculators or mods
                    Double entendres

                    This is the first time I‚Äôm seeing my comment not show because of an edited post. That‚Äôs actually weird lol.
            Something about your use of the Roman numerals there ticked me off... and i hate you... but since i don't wanna seem like a bad guy I'm gonna express that using an anime girl meme so i come off as a fellow degenerate

https://preview.redd.it/q2gkxbbaf6jc1.jpeg?width=732&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=29b1298cb05d69365f319a6a747e2361c44a6c06
                There are no roman numerals in their comment. There's Individual Value (IV) breeding.
                IV breeding? That's just the font. He's talking about breeding IVs, what Roman numerals are you talking about?
                    IV =4 used for "for" in this context. I don't understand what you mean by font...
                        IV is Roman numeral 4, yes, but he's talking about "Individual Values" or IVs.
                            ...

I would have literally never figured that out without help... and yet... i STILL don't know what that means. The individual value thing...

                                Pokemon define their stats by base stats + IVs. IVs are stats that are added to the pokemon each level depending on what kind of pokemon you have battled and gained exp from. Some pokemon will give you attack, some defence and some speed etc.. When you breed two pokemon the offspring will have bonuses depending on the parents' IV, I don't know exactly how that works mechanically but that's what "IV Breeding" means
                                    Damn. I never knew this a thing. Thanks for teaching me about it. ![img](emote|t5_4jn9v4|49342)
                                Individual Values means that every Pokemon and Pal has a range of stats it can have.  
  
Not every Grizzbolt will have the same HP, Atk, and Def even if they have the same passives.
        This is what every pokemon fan has wanted our whole fucking lives dude
            As a pokemon fan I can confirm, palworld is what legends arceus should have been, sure it has glitches, sure the pal base AI is a bit doo doo asscheeks, but it's in early access. The graphics are many leagues above too, sure it was on a switch and this one on PC but look at the zelda open worlds, they look just a bit worse. So in conclusion if P: LA is Daniel, then Palworld is the cooler Daniel
                Damnnn, Daniel
            I really hope it motivates Gamefreak to innovate.  They have the biggest IP in the entire world and haven't had a single innovation in nearly 30 years.  Seriously, what's really changed with Pokemon now vs 30 years ago? Color? 3D? Different types of evolution?
                Part of the problem is Pokemon is owned by 3 companies, Gamefreak, Nintendo, and the Pokemon Company. I doubt all three heads of Cerberus can agree on a new direction when theyve grown so fat on what they do.
                    Nintendo wants the game squeaky clean because they have always put themselves first and foremost as a family company. 

Gamefreak wants consistency and money, so no innovation.

And PC barely knows how to code a game to begin with.
                        > Nintendo wants the game squeaky clean because they have always put themselves first and foremost as a family company. 

Well, most of the time anyway. For Bayonetta 2 the Link costume originally [had no cleavage at all](https://www.siliconera.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/cho_009.jpg), because Platinum Games was worried about exactly that squeaky clean attitude. However, when they took the designs of the Link, Peach, and Samus costumes to Nintendo for approval Nintendo [asked them to add cleavage to the Link outfit](https://www.siliconera.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/20141024_014750.png).
                Game freak rakes in massive profits and continues to sell more games than anyone churning out the same crap. They have no incentive to invest in something like this, their current formula prints money.
            Eh, I loved palworlds and it was amazing, but it‚Äôs certainly not what I wanted my whole life as a Pokemon fan. I think the more hardcore fans that are in to competitive and nuzlocking and the sort don‚Äôt really care for combat, stats, or really anything besides the collection portion of the game. The survival, building, and collection aspects are what I loved about it, the Pokemon aspects not so much, very different games and reasons for enjoyment
                You realize that there are ton of pokemon fans, competitive types are a minority of the actual players.
                    ‚ÄúThis is what every Pokemon fan has ever wanted‚Äù and I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true, even not on an exaggerated level. I think there are a lot of fans of the game that aren‚Äôt just in it for collecting the Dex. Was just giving the more hardcore community a shout because they DEFINITELY wouldn‚Äôt compare it, and there‚Äôs thousands upon thousands of those people, so it‚Äôs really not that small of a group. Have quite a few friends that just play the mainline games once or twice and don‚Äôt get too into it and even they agree it‚Äôs really not all that similar.
                        That last group you mentioned is most likely the biggest part of the Pok√©mon audience. Those that play the games a bit maybe finish the main story.
                            Yeah completely agree. It‚Äôs a smaller percent of people sure, but we generally play the games dozens of times through in different ways or have much much longer playthroughs. It‚Äôs also a much higher percent of people playing it year long instead of when the game releases or every few years when they have the urge to
                                Which is why palworld is exciting because it's an evolving world. It's not locked in place. I can come back in 6 months and the game could have changed alot. If I come back to scarlet and violet i get to pay $30 bucks for a couple hours of new stuff. And then wait a year for the next $60 game drop
                                    Yeah, I‚Äôm super excited for the future, 60 hours for a 30 dollar game is already worth it to me, I‚Äôm sure in the future, especially with modding, this will be a multi 100 hour game
                        Yeah Palworld doesn't give me the same feeling at all. I'm not a competitive player by any means but sometimes come back to play some of the more challenging firered rom hacks. 

The main problem with the Pokemon main series for me is the difficulty. You only really scratch the surface of the combat mechanics because the game is so easy. 

Another one is content. They had some neat mechanics like the Pokemon contests. Wish they would extend on stuff like that.
                So the majority of longtime Pmon fans myself included agree with the previous statement lol, you don't speak for us in any way, shape, or form. And the competitive circuit is It's own community, most people don't want lumped in with the min-max crowd bc they suck all the fun out of literally everything lol
                    It‚Äôs not just competitive min maxers, it‚Äôs nuzlockers, challenge runners, shiny hunters and several other categories. I never claimed it wasn‚Äôt majority, I just think saying it‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs or even almost everyone‚Äôs is just wrong, probably 70% or so would agree, but a lot of people see very little similarities between the two besides ‚Äúcollective monster in ball‚Äù. There really isn‚Äôt much strategy involved with the game and that‚Äôs a huge part of Pokemon for A LOT of people. Disregarding huge portion of the community (even if not the majority, there‚Äôs still A LOT of people that are in one of these groups)
                        They're not meant to be compared directly lol, see this is why people say yall suck the fun out of everything. There's plenty of strategy in it's own right. Choosing the right pals/techniques for an encounter makes it much easier, is that not strategy to you? Just bc you can do more in the moment than stand around giving commands doesn't mean it's not strategic. And nuzlockers would live it. I'm doing a no catch run rn where I'm going through the journey without crafting or using a single sphere. Shiny hunters would enjoy the hunts for lucky and Alt types, and I'd love to hear about these other categories bc it sounds like you're just moving goalposts for the sake of not being wrong.
                            ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not meant to be compared directly‚Äù

Ok so I‚Äôm right and it‚Äôs not what we‚Äôve been waiting for this whole time lol, if they aren‚Äôt comparable than it‚Äôs not what we waited for it
                                No you're just deluded and think you speak for the community as a whole, which your ass backwards opinions contradict. I don't know a single pokemon fan that isn't absolutely insufferable as a human being that doesn't think this game is cool. You can be triggered all you want but yes the majority of Pmon fans think palworld is awesome lol.
                                    I‚Äôve literally said multiple times I don‚Äôt speak for the majority? Just a large group of people lol, just stop, I‚Äôm not responding anymore to this needless agression
            lol. lmao even
            Is it? I thought Pok√©mon fans wanted an actual JRPG instead of a mediocre survival game with a Pok√©mon gimmick slapped on top of it. I just don't see how this game has anything to do with Pok√©mon once the honeymoon period of monster collection fades away.
            You guys wanted a survival craft game? My brother, you did not have to wait all these years.
        My wife grew up on Pok√©mon. Still has her card collection but has lost interest in the last 10 years. They just keep rehashing the same game formula with occasional, uninteresting spinoffs that dont provide much replay value. The closest thing they made to a Pok√©mon game for adults was the Ryan Reynolds movie.

We have about 70 hours combined in palworld (mostly her), and she says this is the kind of game pokemon should have made.
            everyone who likes Pokemon has been saying the same thing and its damn true
                Not me.
                    I think Pokemon Violet was a lot like Palworld. Because  once I got to the part you are supposed to walk up the hill to school, I just explored the entire map climbing mountains and catching Pals instead.
            Pokemon is never gonna rehash itself to be an entirely different genre. It would be silly. Palworld is ARK with pokemon and that's it, expecting pokemon to drop its entire battle system and genre(which is a global esport with monetary prizes btw) to chase a new genre is absurd and would alienate its audience.

No one who actually grew up with pokemon wants palworld as the future. Even romhack makers don't make stuff like palworld, they create rpgs with pokemon. That's what they always have been. I'm glad you Teo enjoy palworld, but to say pokemon should've made a game like palworld is so disconnected from what pokemon actually is.

I've seen this sentiment lot of people wishing pokemon would be like palworld and the reality is no it shouldn't be.  Pokemon is nearly 30 years, growing every year, catching new generations of fans and keeping plenty of old ones doing what they do. Can there be a survival game spinoff? Sure but that's not pokemon, that's a survival game with pokemon and frankly I think the idea of automation via pokemon slaves would be pretty shitty world building wise.

Is it formulaic? Yes. But that's why pokemon works. I'd rather pokemon keeps IMPROVING at what they do, and not lose their identity. No other major player does what pokemon does in gaming. And yea the games need better performance and more story, they absolutely have room to grow, WITHIN their field.

Anyone saying Palworld is the kind of game pokemon should have made is detached from what pokemon really is and has their own mental canon of what it could be. We don't need "pokemon for adults". Pokemon is for everyone. In the same way that disney movies are for everyone.
                Theres people who played pokemon r/b/y/g/s and stopped. Being a pokemon fan doesnt mean youve purchased/played every game in the franchise. This game works well for people who only played gen 1/2 pokemon and happen to like survival games too. Ask someone if they enjoyed valheim, ask if they played pokemon red/blue. If the answer is yes to both theyll enjoy palworld.
                    What part of RGBY would match palworld? If anything people who played the more modern games that actually are open world (legends arceus and SV) are more likely to enjoy palworld if only because the open world design similarity. A thin connection but a bigger one than saying "oh you played pokemon 25 years ago? You'll love this survival game where you collect monsters." There have been plenty of monster collector games since, it takes more than catching monsters to be a good game.

It's disingenuous to conflate pokemon gameplay to palworld and i really don't think there's any connection. Hell my palworld friend actively does not like pokemon and never has and he loves palworld, because they're not the same.
                        You‚Äôve got such a rage boner that you‚Äôre conflating everything i‚Äôve said. I‚Äôm done talking at you, if you want discourse i‚Äôll come back later when you‚Äôve had your juice box and chill out.
        Agreed. I miss evolving the Pals. I have never played enough Ark to immediately like the building and producing parts. Had to really spend hours in the beginning since I had 0 experience, so picking a place for my 1st base was done at random.

But the Pals walking outside, the world being not so empty as the latest games from Pok√©mon, that's all a dream from a Pok√©mon player (who played mainly during HG/SS). Collecting Pals, having shinies (unfortunately not entirely like I would have wanted), breeding, eggs - that's the things that make for a fit as well.
            Pokemon could easily take inspiration from other games to make different genres too. Like a pokemon cozy farming game would be amazing. Like rune factory or even what palworld does on a surface level.

I enjoyed the turn base RPG of Arceus - it was fast paced and kept me engaged. But it was basically it's only mechanic so the game got old for me much faster than palworld. I'm about 100 hours in on Palworld and I only did about 20 hours on Arceus.

One game was $60 and the other was $30. I think Gamefreak has an unreasonable release schedule, but as long as 20 million people buy their games full price every year they have no reason to change anything.

Even with palworld being a success they again have no reason to change anything because fans will still buy their games.

Until sales take a downward turn they aren't going to budge.
            Evolving pals just lowers the amount of useful pals in the game, same as pokemon.¬†
        I'm a purely Pok√©mon fan and I've really been enjoying every aspect of Palworld. Gives you a lot more freedom for what you can do with your critters compared to Pok√©mon and I really like that.
        It also seems like they are developing an rog aspect. imagine if they added towns larger towns in non start areas and trainers that you can fight. theres already one guy who has in inferam as his pal chillin on a hilltop
        *Pulls out butchering cleaver*

It‚Äôs a tad different 

*(Pixels and slicing sounds)*
        Them custom sliders can make it manageable.
        Have a friend that hated ark, loves Pok√©mon. Loves pals. I think it‚Äôs a very good fit for purely Pok√©mon fans. It‚Äôs something different after years of similar game after game
        >I am not sure if it is a good fit for purely Pokemon fans. It is a very different game after all

yeah, its the game fans have been praying for, perfect for pokemon fans
        I keep trying to tell people they‚Äôre completely different games. If someone told me they loved every single detail about Palworld and wanted something similar there are about a dozen games I‚Äôd recommend before Pok√©mon unless they told me their favorite element of the game was the Pal Deck. And even then, it wouldn‚Äôt be the top recommendation.

I‚Äôd say the same thing if the story were flipped and someone wanted pokemon-likes. They are just not similar games at all.
            To me, I explain to pokemon players that Palworld is what I had hoped Pokemon Arceus would be like
            I love riding with Zoe & Grizzbolt! ü§™
            They are very different games. They are very similar brands/IPs. The majority of people who play Pok√©mon play it because if the IP and aren‚Äôt particularly attached to the gameplay. If a Pok√©mon fan is dissatisfied with the quality or diversity of gameplay, which is a *lot*, this is an excellent choice.
            they are different, but as someone who primarily plays Pok√©mon, it was enough to make me want to play this game. I also really liked cassette beasts. I think it‚Äôs got potential be a genre that really only Pok√©mon occupied before.
            Out of curiosity what games would you recommend?
                Conan exiles and Ark are the big ones I‚Äôd assume
                    Grounded too!
        You can change the setting to make it just like Pok√©mon actually
        As an almost 33 year old Pok√©mon fan can confirm this is the game we‚Äôve wanted our entire adult lives lol
        My husband does not like ark or conan, loves Pokemon, he loves this game.
            The theme is pokemon-esque (which is really just monster catching) but the gameplay is still Ark/Conan.

I loved the concept of Ark but raising an army of dodos and spitters over 2 days to eventually whittle down and capture a raptor got old quick when it took 2 days to get to the taming the raptor only to die a stupid death and have it lost to the map. Then try and find another, succeed in taming, get mobbed *and it's gone*. 

Then I didn't play for a day and my dodos all died of hunger. Then I jumped in my friend's server and saw a 30 day timer for for a brachiosaurus, and noped right out.

Ark was amazing, but it took the survival stuff to the extreme and turned it into a job. Palworld has all the accessibility Ark lacked (I only played the first at launch so no idea if it changed).
        It‚Äôs everything that the older Pok√©mon fans who grew up with the franchise have always wanted imo
        The game is different. The brand is very similar. Most Pok√©mon players don‚Äôt really care about Pok√©mon‚Äôs gameplay as much as the brand. Having a game that‚Äôs higher quality while providing something other than the same formula is very welcome for those players.
            Which is also why this is a flash in the pan. Pokemons longevity stems from its designs and the comfort of its systems. It might get samey for people after 30 years but it's a continuous guarantee of what you're gonna get and that keeps people coming back when they have that itch. It also has much larger audience as a brand. Card game players, merch collectors, anime enjoyers.

But they always stay for the merch and designs, and that has staying power. Palworld doesn't have that. It's a survival game and while a good one, it's not really a name worth remembering in a year or 5 years. The Pals by and large are forgettable, and the aesthetic of the game is very much  a unity asset store vomit outside of the pals (which themselves are mostly model redesigns of existing pokemon)

It's new gameplay with pokemon at home and once that wears itself out people will move on. Which is a shame cause if palworld had been more unique and focused on its brand it could have grown, but this was a small company and it's not exactly easy to make a successful monster series.

What was closest? Neopets? Even that died in time. The actual successful series are under big corporate umbrellas. Pokemon has nintendo,  digimon has toei/Bandai. Yokai watch has also decline but it too was heavily under nintendo umbrella as their publisher. Its not cheap to create dozens of monsters that have lasting appeal and a world building skill to match
        Is don‚Äôt like ark and I don‚Äôt know what Conan exiles is and I love Pok√©mon since 6th grade when red came to the states.  I love palworld I can see why you think it‚Äôs not a great fit for Pok√©mon lovers but I think at its heart it‚Äôs a Pok√©mon game it‚Äôs the only way to level significantly.  I love this game.
            >Is don‚Äôt like ark and I don‚Äôt know what Conan exiles is

So, picture ARK, but with two main changes:

1. Instead of being mostly on tropical/subtropical islands, it's set predominantly in an Iron Age desert (also features some jungles, arctic wastes, and a volcano, but the desert region is both central and ***big***).
2. Instead of fighting and taming dinosaurs, you're primarily fighting cannibals, bandits, and slavers, and are yourself enslaving them (there's still animal taming, but it takes a backseat to the slavery).

...actually, a third important change, too. You can climb up walls like you can in Palworld and Breath of the Wild. I *think* Conan: Exiles might actually have been the first big game to do that, but I'm not certain.
        I would say the opposite I think it's shares alot or aspects with Pok√©mon in alot of ways and there is nothing wrong with that
        It reminded me a lot of Pokemon legends Arceus which is currently my favorite Pokemon game; right down to the "catch multiple of the same monster" stuff
        Correct. Yes they have a catching mechanic like pokemon that even better than the pokemon games BUT they don‚Äôt have the storyline, the battling (except for the towers), they don‚Äôt have the gym battles, etc‚Ä¶ 

I love pokemon and pal work definitely kicks it up a notch but I do wish there was more towns, a story, gym battles, etc.. 

The game is early access. Who know where it‚Äôll go and that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm excited for the most about this game!
        Yea game really isn‚Äôt that much like pokemon, battle mechanics are butt currently. I find myself frustrated with how often my pal just wonders around not attacking a boss or the boss completely ignoring my pal to target me.
    This. All of these are my favorite games including Palworld. Haven‚Äôt played it much the past week, but I have around 60 hours and am renting a server to play with friends. 

I‚Äôm sure my interest will wane and I‚Äôll pick up another game until the next update, and I‚Äôm cool with that. It‚Äôs a really fun game and worth the 30$
    Even if you like rust, you fit, only thing you miss is pvp which they will add overtime
    This comment is on Chad levelüëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº
    The game reminds me more of Prime Fortnite Save The World (the original game before Battle Royale took over), especially with the shield mechanics, regen system and the abilities.
    [deleted]
        I wasn't a puppy-kicker before, but palworld helped me change and grow as a person!
    Definetly not. It's a good fit if you happen to like all those games at the same time. It's definetly temporary hype, but it won't die if the developer won't let it. It will keep a small but regular fanbase, imo
    Not an accurate statement. Those have PVP
    And in the grand scheme of gaming survival games are a niche. Palworld is really just another gaming fighting for a tiny piece of land.

The worst thing about Palworld is its exclusivity to Xbox. I‚Äôve enjoyed the game thoroughly but the fact that hardly anyone owns an Xbox its suffocating its potential playerbase. Same exact thing happened to Valheim.

PC gamers aren‚Äôt going to stick around either because they just jump on whatever the newest trend is every other week since they get 15 trillion new games every year.
Played 180 hours, and I am not finished. I hope it will get cool updates, but I got my money worth already.
    110 hours right now, level 48, definitely gotten moneys worth and I‚Äôm still excited to play it tonight
        Around the same and can confirm it was well worth it.

Usually with games I go hardcore and feel like I have to grind constantly. With this game yeah I grind when I do play, but for some reason I don‚Äôt feel like I have to. The game has so much to enjoy in the various aspects that I know I will play again soon, but don‚Äôt feel pressured to.
    Totally agree with you. Was kinda shocked when a buddy of mine wished there was some stuff in it (i dont think he considered it early access) and was bored after 40 hours while he was only lv30 and had still loads of stuff to do. Then again i know he quits games very often midgame.
        There's almost zero story. Pokemon isn't about catching Pokemon, it's about becoming a champion. 

Palworld just has traces around the map and some boss fights.  The majority of players need a path to follow.
            Yup that is in fact valid criticism, in a sense that the game appeals more to the   
1) survival - basebuilding - creativity - exploring formula  
2) gotta catch em' all addictiveness  
3) looting and leveling game-loop (obtain stuff to obtain more/other stuff to obtain more/other stuff etc) 

Personally, 1) doesn't catch me as much as others, I barely decorate as the stuff costs research points that I rather spent on stuff that "does something". However, totally fell for the 2) Paldeck and had to explore and catch everything there was, long before the level of my character/ game would  have me leave the early areas. 3) never really hurts, could've done with less, wouldn't mind more.

The boss towers and I suppose end of the game (the island with the tree..?) were afterthoughts for me, didn't care at all (100hours in and only did 2 towers, haven'g gone to the big tree) but I absolutely see how this type of open world would not work for let's say pokemon players that rather have a narrative and prefer a straight path to progress along
                The game has everything but doesn't shine in anything

Base building is barebones, farming/pet management simulator is barebones too

Figts need balancing

Story non existent

The game is absolutely worth the money, but it has very big room for growth
                    Yep. I‚Äôd also argue the tower bosses are‚Ä¶ just there. Even the lowest level boss with Grizzbolt? Is way harder than the content around it. 

The other bosses except maybe Lily are super tough. 

We need to bring the tower bosses into lore other than the logs, because they are kinda just there. Optional content as such.
                        The lore, loosely from what I‚Äôve gathered, is that the island used to be ruled by the legends. People and pals lived in harmony. The tower bosses are the leaders of the various groups that changed the landscape by outcasting the legends and humans alike and taking power for themselves. This is why there‚Äôs relatively few unallied humans and the legends live off in their little corners.
                Just FYI you can't make it to the big tree without glitching around the skybox.
                I hope they can change the research point system. I wasted so many points on early items because at that point you could afford everything. Now in the tail end of the game I have to hunt down manuals to unlock what I really want to use.
            I don't believe the majority of players need a path to follow given how many sandbox games are extremely successful.
                Which? The major souls-likes  have a story. Zelda and Skyrim have side quests. Minecraft is probably the one exception.
                    7 days to die  
Terraria  
Factorio  
Rimworld  
Ark (mostly)  
Mount & Blade  
Valheim  
Enshrouded
                    None of those games are survival sandboxes.

Survivals sole point is you‚Äôre gonna need to explore if you want to survive/progress.

It‚Äôs a genre that really doesn‚Äôt need heavy story elements other than explaining why you‚Äôre in this mess.
                    Minecraft, Roblox, Fortnite, GTA, Ark, etc.
            There is some story with the adventurer logs and stuff. Also build your own story based on what you see. There is a reason why there isn't a path to follow.  It's a sandbox game
                Calling the adventurer logs a story is a joke and you know it
                    I wouldn't call it a story, more of background information and observations on pals, the world and the various bosses.
                    Yeah I like the game but thats kinda cope
                It's like subnautica in a sense
            I think story will come after. These journals we find scattered across the map hint at a bigger picture that we dont see yet, or simply havent got access to. We are told that these powers generate some form of energy and need to be protected.
        Just because there is stuff to unlock doesnt mean there is stuff to do TO unlock those things besides grinding, and not everyone likes grindy games
        I stopped playing around mid game. You kindve realize it‚Äôs just a massive world in which the only thing you really do is capture pals while traveling around. Sure there‚Äôs the base building aspect too, but even then there‚Äôs not much a point of investing in that once you have all the crafting benches and whatnot
            Yeh the game feels 60% complete which is what the creators have said


I got bored mid game. The gameplay loop got stale real fast once the initial base building and fun levelling was had trying to fill my paldex of pals


Its not fun capturing 10 of each just to get earn big XP. Its extremely repetitive and feels like a chore. Theres not many other ways to earn enough XP to level up for the end game content like defeating the final boss towers or capturing the legendary pals. 


Im stuck in the mid game with a horrendous grind


Dungeons are just a copy and paste job in each area. No interesting POI's for exploration. No random interactions during exploation that are fun. The little villages are a bit of a joke in that at best they have a pal trader and a standard merchant and thats it
    needs some serious upgrades. its cool but dry feeling

 *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*
there's still an immense demand. obviously there's some things not in the game (yet) that were advertised. case in point: that bipedal fox looking one in the image you're using. and that flying Kyogre looking bigboi. and that cart from the trailer. it's also apparent from the world map itself that there's room for more. 

clearly the decline is from people who've done everything that *can* be done off an early access product. that said when they add more, they'll draw some more back, and even more when the game is officially a finished product.
    The [roadmap](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palworld/comments/19ee4gt/the_future_of_palworld_palworld_road_map/) indicated they plan on adding additional islands.
    That's also because people have no chill lmao. Playing for like 300 plus hours. They'll add a shit ton more. More pals and islands are coming.
        I never understand how people clock up those numbers in when the games only been out for so long, like i always feel like i play videogames a lot but ive only hit 400ish on a few games ive played for years
    100% agree that the map is clearly 1/4 of the planned space. We've got plenty of future content coming, assuming the devs don't manage to blow through a hundred million dollars before they make it.
    Are we looking at the same pic? Every pal in that image is currently in the game.
Really high potential.

Any article about a ‚Äúdeclining player base‚Äù is click bait bullshit.

There were the same ‚Äúarticles‚Äù for both Baldur‚Äôs Gate 3 and Elden Ring. I assume Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom would have also had similar ‚Äúarticles‚Äù if it was on steam and the same ‚Äújournalists‚Äù could link Steam Charts.
    >Any article about a ‚Äúdeclining player base‚Äù is click bait bullshit.

This reminds me when a company is like "Blah blah sees a 5% drop in revenue after it's HIGHEST QUARTER OF ALL TIME. Layoffs expected."

Like Jesus people can we not just chill and let it play out instead of punishing people by making drastic moves?

This game will be fine as long as they keep updating the game regularly.
        Modern capitalism requires that companies have the highest quarter ever every quarter. It looks bad for shareholders and if they think they won't get their profits they will sell, furthering the issue of profits.

The idea of a company wanting to work on a game out of passion rather than future DLC or future game releases goes directly against what shareholders want.
            As someone who knows nothing about share market and business, cant a company just remain on a shop like level with one guy owning it with hundreds of employee ? Does it always need to be turned into shares type model if it grows successful and large ?
                If they want investments from others rather than using their own money, yes. It's not "required" but most companies that want growth see it as a faster and cheaper way to go about it.
                    Not the only way. They could leverage, they could sell minority ownership to one person to retain control, and they can use the profits to grow. Speaking as a business owner, incorporating is NOT even close to the only option.
                It can, see Valve for an example of a company staying private.

But it can be difficult to get serious amounts of investment money into your company without the prospect of turning into a public share model company.
                There's plenty of large private companies but private investment is generally more expensive than public. And much less liquid
                    Not to mention that large private companies tend to have less media coverage precisely because there's not as much public interest in their performance.
                [deleted]
                If you have investors. They want a higher bottom line every quarter or there will be changes. It honestly kills a lot of games. And I don't know if this is true.. but I heard in the US if you knowingly do something that will cause that bottom line to shrink... Even if it's good for the long-term of the company you can be outed from the company.
            This isnt capitalism this is if anything this comes from confuscionism and arguably socialism. As this sentiment that games always need to be played year round comes from the gaming markets in countries like china and s.korea, where games that can be played year round day in day out are hyper profitable. This is becuase those two ideologies have created societies in which a huge % young men at the bottom have no chance of bettering their lives romantically or economically, so they can afford to and have the time to literally game all the time. Western devs have seen this and are now trying to take adv on western economic downturn aswell.
            Your first paragraph is so far off base‚Ä¶ just shows how many uninformed people there are out there.
    Yeah, I mean just about every game will have a ‚Äúdeclining player base‚Äù. Any big game is bound to have millions and millions of players playing on release and those players will do everything they wanted to do in the game and put it on hold until updates
        Yeah. It didn‚Äôt take long to 100% the game. I spent a little time working aesthetics after that and then it‚Äôs either pause the game or do the breeding grind. 

Frankly I put enough hours in that I‚Äôm entirely satisfied even if I never pick up the game again. 

But it will need some more depth for real replay-ability.
        Exactly. The fact that an *unfinished* game still has **315k** players online, on Steam alone no less, a month after dropping with *severe bugs and unfinished content* is a pretty good sign.
    Pocketpair called those articles lazy as fuxk. Declining player base is to be expected, since players are starting to exhaust the early release content. I myself finished everything in 77 hours and started playing Lies Of P, but will definitely come back to Palworld when there are updates.
        Funny, I was actually playing Lies of P when this distracted me :)

But yeah, if it isn't an always online game like an mmo something declining user counts is just business as usual.

Once I am done with this I will go back to P as well probably only returning once it has hit official release to do a fresh playthrough.
    > Any article about a ‚Äúdeclining player base‚Äù is click bait bullshit.

The funniest bit is that all these articles talk about the **massive** drop in players and well, this "failure" is now only the most played [third party game on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed).

Oh no, 3rd place behind Counter-Strike and DOTA. How the mighty have fallen.
        CS and Dota are free2play it‚Äôs kinda crazy it surpassed them in the first place as a paid game.
        Just look at it now‚Ä¶ I guess those stupid journos were right after all??
            Oh no, 9th place, and 4th place for games that cost money.

What's funny is that 1st through 8th are all live service games. I mean, unless you think people aren't buying GTA V for GTA Online.

Edit: They just announced a raid and have been fixing bugs since launch. I think they'll be fine, barring the CEO of Pocket Pair picking up a cocaine addiction or them never leaving early access like craftopia.
    yah lol, as time progresses people will "beat" the game and drop it to wait for new stuff, Elden ring is a masterpiece but after you beat it there's no much reason to replay unless you want to play diferent builds
    This is not a online game that force you to play daily. Most player who bought this game at launch would have already finished first play through and sit back to wait for new content. Of course the active player will drop.
    Brain rot from multi-player games. Only reason these articles are made is because fucking modern day idiots compare multi-player games vs singleplayer games in terms of how "alive" they are for active user bases. These morons can't understand that once you "beat" a singleplayer game most people just stop playing and multi-player games are designed to be an endless gameplay loop...
        > These morons can't understand that once you "beat" a singleplayer game most people just stop playing and multi-player games are designed to be an endless gameplay loop

Lol they're well aware, my dude. They write click bait bullshit because their job is to write click bait bullshit because the kind of dumdum that clicks on click bait bullshit is also more likely to click through ads.  Journalism sucks because people don't want to pay for journalism.
            Yeah I was mostly referring to the mindless consoomers and dumbasses in general talking about player count it's always all about the money with business
    The "decline" is part because people like me, who love the game, but don't have all the time in the world. I haven't played in like 2 weeks. So I count as a player leaving the game. But I'll be back. Oh, I have big plans for my playtime with this game. Don't you worry. I've also only played on gamepass and plan to grab it on Steam here soon.
        I stopped playing it because it felt unfinished and I want to come back later. So, there‚Äôs that reason too.
    It makes sense people beat the game and are moving to other things,  I'm not sure why that's shocking lol
    The devs seem like they have a good mentality for this.  They pretty much said of course the player base will go down after people have been grinding it for weeks that‚Äôs natural.  Go play other games and come back when you‚Äôre ready or when they drop a content update.
    I mean it might make sense to make an article like that for an MMO or a Game As A Service model, but for a game with a linear story that isn‚Äôt massive, who cares if lots of people have already gotten their money‚Äôs worth out of the game? 

The game far exceeded the devs‚Äô expectations day 1. There is no longer a fail condition. Palworld, despite being early access, has succeeded as a game. I agree that those articles are dishonest and I‚Äôm a little embarrassed for those writers.
    Journalism is a fucking joke nowadays.

Journalists like that contribute nothing to society. They are actual degenerates. Useless. No skills. Pieces of shit.
    Palworld reacted to the article saying it's ok to move on to other game and that they hope those people will come back and play later and that they love them either way.
    Every game plateaus. Even the new Helldiver's 2 is going to before much longer 

But this game won't die for a long time. It already has to many fans and loyalists. People who will never quit playing it and making everyone else wonder why people still play it.

Ark, No Man's Sky, Elite Dangerous etc....they all end up like that. But they keep going because the players keep playing
    >There were the same ‚Äúarticles‚Äù for both Baldur‚Äôs Gate 3 and Elden Ring.

Elden Ring declined from \~1M players to \~50K currently so I'd say that's a quite huge decline. You can complete the game in a few weeks, there's no good reason to continue playing it, even tho it has great replay value. For context if Dota 2, LoL or CS2 would go to \~50K players it would be pretty much considered "dead".

I think the issue with Palworld is that it doesn't take that long to complete it, so ppl build all the stuff, test out the weapons, try the pals and they simply quit playing. All who will keep playing for long time probably are base builders. So it probably has to push new content once in a while to keep the playerbase or add new online game modes.
        It's not a fair comparison because unlike those 3 games Elden Ring and Palworld aren't multiplayer focused games.
    The steam chart is straight down after the peak on release. Are you just saying the site is inaccurate?
        No.

I cannot believe I have to spell this out, but it is Reddit after all.

It‚Äôs normal for a game to lose players after launch.

These ‚Äúarticles‚Äù are trying to stir up shit from nothing. Palworld still has 500k. Baldur‚Äôs Gate 3 still had like 140k or so. 

These games aren‚Äôt ‚Äúdead‚Äù, the content has just been completed by most players, and people will return when new content comes out.
            Doubtful, it‚Äôs a fad game. I‚Äôm impressed it got so high by just milking the pokemon similarities. Literally Arc with pokemon nothing new or creative. Game will keep falling because people have already played this game with a different skin.

    it's not tho

2mil active players to 300k active isn't a click bait bullshit lie
        It‚Äôs not a game as a service, so the player count doesn‚Äôt matter. People continuing to play the game on official servers actually will cost it money. It made its millions. Now they can hire more staff and build the game up better. Then, when new content drops, players will come back and check it out.

So it is litteral clickbait. The amount of players is a meaningless number. You don‚Äôt need a population. Are you the type of person ‚ÄúGame lost players, bad game, can‚Äôt play bad game.‚Äù?
         And it's still #3 on Steam most players even with that dropoff. So...who cares?
    I saw zero articles about the games you mentioned
    >Any article about a ‚Äúdeclining player base‚Äù is click bait bullshit

Lol wot.
    Why would it be a clickbait? Most of the people finished the game, played 100hours and now won't touch it before the next major update.
    Andddd you were wrong!
        Nope. It‚Äôs a single player/co-op game. Nothing has changed.

Elden Ring for example will continue to rise as we get closer to the DLC, hit its peak again during it, then drop once again.

And so will Palworld. It will rise when the new raid comes out, then drop again.
            It has decreased in player count week over week every day since release. 

It has retained less than 5% of its player base.
                Just like any other non-live service game? Like wtf are you even saying?

How many people are playing The Witcher 2 right now???!
                    Elden ring did not lose 95% of its player base in a month. Neither did baldurs gate.

I am not even going to respond to your attempt at a comparison because it is utterly asinine and ridiculous.
    This just isn‚Äôt true lol the game has a lot of issues that effect Midgame to endgame and take a lot of the enjoyment away, causing players to quit but it‚Äôs hard to talk about when you losers keep screaming ‚ÄúTHIS GAME IS THE BEST LOL L POK√âMON‚Äù
    Definitely is not clickbait bullshit lol. I have reached the end of game and there's nothing else to do.
        Yes. Which is NORMAL. Declining player base because users beat the game is how gaming worked for decades before gaming as a service. 

Imagine beating The Last of Us and being like "boy, the player base is declining".
        it's an early acess game? Are you expecting infinite playability?
            At least a way to keep you entertained. Now there's literally nothing to do.
                Nothing to do and nothing *you want* to do are different.
                    Mr condenser over here
                        I mean, it's something to do.
                            Tis true. Y'all have fun with that king
                So‚Ä¶ play a new game‚Ä¶ Jesus

        Yeah, the game is early access‚Ä¶. You got a brain?

The development isn‚Äôt done. I think you should stay away from early access and stop playing what everyone tells you to play.
220,000 reviews, 94% positive, and reaching steam's number 2 highest concurrent player count ever in the 1st week of early access, would suggest a bit more than just hype to me. We're a month after release now and it's still #3 most played game on steam.

Whilst possible to get through all the content so far (and get bored of breeding/condensing before you max out the things you want to max), it's helluva fun game as is.
    The breading and condensing is a time suck, I‚Äôm in the group that‚Äôs starting to get bored.

I want to go explore but I run out of ammo or spheres and have to go back and make both of them which can take all the time I have to play that day. That dynamic is getting tiresome. I want to play but I get on and have to do chores lol.
        why don‚Äòt you up the drops? Less grinding, more exploring
            Exactly what I did. Every time a portion of the game got boring, too grindy or tedious, I changed the settings, used We Mod or downloaded mods to go through it faster.

Breeding is the best example. I made a maxed out Anubis with LV 5 handiwork. That took forever and wasn't interested in doing that again with other pals so I downloaded a mod to make eggs instantly and one where I only need 1 pal per level to condense.
                Ooo that‚Äôs a really fantastic idea! I don‚Äôt mind some grinding but breeding is so tedious. I‚Äôve never used mods before but I also heard there‚Äôs one that lets you share items in boxes between bases so maybe I‚Äôll start looking into that :)
                    Hopefully they're paying attention to mod creation and traction, then integrate the most popular mods into game mechanics.

Like, say, you're happy with your second/third base placement and you want to share resources. Now you have to lay down a rail or pipe system between bases to enable that. Takes time to build and gets attacked as you're building, but once built is safe and makes all materials available.

Or maybe it's never safe from attack and another building near the transfer tiles in the tech tree opens up a command and conquer style game play where you send in pals from the box to counter attack.

Breeding seems to have the most complaints. Create a nursery pal or two that ups high IV odds / makes attaining the perks you want easier. Could adjust them so the benefits from them grow as you breed/capture stronger pals.
                I'm playing the game on hard mode... But I think I'll have dedicated breeding days where I turn it to easy. Because ain't no way I'm waiting days for breeding.

The fact the timers stop the moment you exit the game is insane to me.... Having to play 20+ hours for a large egg.. absurd.

Nothing else grindy bothers me though. I'm happy to not rush through the game like most people, having nothing left to do in game.

Plus, I'm thinking, if you rush to overpowered pals.. then all of the games challenge is Really eliminated. It's not like there's pvp yet. You're just gonna be blasting through bosses and to collecting things, and repeat.

 Now That can get Boring!
                    Well as long as people had fun playing at the pace they did it's good. I definitely did the end game stuff faster than most would, but I had fun. Anyways I still have things to do
                    Huh? Is that a single player thing? I'm on a server, and the egg timers keep going when you log off. Having to actually wait 20 hours in game is terrible
                        Yup. It's cause servers run all the time
            I‚Äôm preconditioned to believe if I change any settings from normal I will not get achievements‚Ä¶ and meaningless computer awards are more important than streamlining the game to my available time. I see your logic and I will take it under consideration.
            Most casual players are not going to them know where that setting is
        farm gold and find the merchants that sell ammo or materials to be in your base
        Yep, I switched my egg hatch timer to instant and even then I found it way too boring to even bother with, I also upped my mined items boost to 3x once I got to level 48 because the cost of crafting spheres is way too high imo, it's almost like the game doesn't want you to catch high level pals
        Put the breeding eggs to zero timer. The 2 hour wait is purely gimmick. You have better things to do than just kill 2 hours and hope it‚Äôs a good egg or not etc
        Yeah, I don't think I'd have an issue if my mine base actually worked while I wasn't standing afk there. And maybe let me buy palfluids for the cement crafting.
        I want to max out a bee squad (eliz & 4 beegardes) as well as a swee squad, and also multiple 4 member squads for maxing the elemental damage of whatever 5th pal I choose, but I also can't be bothered lmao.
        Yeah you can increase drops by like 5x and then just get a fuck ton of ammo in one trip. No need to grind menial stuff unless you like to.
    I am having a grand ol time but I can feel myself nearing endgame on my main playthrough. I've definitely gotten my money's worth, and based on the trailer there's more content to come. I hope they flesh it out more with "full" release and continue to make new games, because I'm having a blast.
    Also the game isn‚Äôt even out yet, it‚Äôs early access and surprising polished. Even the AI pathing might be horrible but at least it‚Äôs somewhat functional. I played so many 1.0 games with worst bugs.
    Wouldn't #2 in the first week be the very definition of hype though?¬†


Having said that #3 a month in is indeed really impressive! Hope the game keeps doing well and wish the team behind it all the best!
every game has a decline in player base. palworld is here to stay and will have its community
    Yep. Will be playing more when updates and things become available. The game will be fine.
        Yeah, at this point I think "will it continue?" is 100% up to devs. At the current point in time it's fun and playable, but content is limited. Unless you get deep into base-building or breeding, there's only so much time you can spend on the game. More pals, more plot, and more map will decide this game's future.
            Honestly the building sucks ass also they need to add more building freedom when it comes to things clipping into each other like imagine building a nice looking roof without it looking ugly or slowing us to clip those triangles into the sides of stairs or leting us clip 2 walls into eachother for an X shape anything the only thing would be rules about crafting stations


In short just br more lenient about objects clipping into other objects to make it easier to make things look nice
            Yeah a story would be great not just lore. It beats Pokemon out in graphics and I guess bugs not being everywhere. Everything else not really. PVP will probably be just shooting, since the pals are AI controlled, there no story. Just lore in books.
        Even if the devs stop after 2 or 3 years, the modding community will keep it alive. It's like Minecraft. Played it from alpha till today, thanks to mods...
    No one is playing Palworld for months on end, majority got their moneys worth while playing the game. Yeah it will decline but its not a loss as the devs gotten the money and fans are happy.

It has multiplayer but it isint an MMORPG where oops you need to grab your dailies and fomo!
        Its not even a full game yet lol. So when it fully releases, itll have more content,  and hopefully be more user friendly
        Not just that but it probably has large spikes when a new update releases that  adds stuff
    The other massive thing about the game is the devs actually listen to the players, they‚Äôre responsive and proactive on social media keeping people informed of how it‚Äôs developing, there‚Äôs not many of the toxic traits of modern gaming like micro-transactions, abusive chat, etc. They‚Äôve also already stated they‚Äôre looking at implementing a third-party service to prevent cheating. I don‚Äôt play it all the time but I am still really excited to see what the future brings for this game.
    After 3 weeks it lost 75% of the players on steam.

Not saying it is a bad game, not trying to insult, but that is not normal for most games. Seems like this game got very hyped and possibly started losing interest fast. And I doubt the hype will be the same or more when it releases. 

I am only talking about % which does matter, but is not the most important. Since 500k is still a fuck ton. 

Bg3 for example lost 75% after 8 weeks. Elden Ring after 6 weeks. 

Not directly comparing them as games, just seeing what is happening. Not meant as an insult or shaming them or whatever. I play this game myself.
Fam, it‚Äôs okay if you don‚Äôt play the hell out of a game everyday forever. IMO if I get 100 hours or so of enjoyment for 70 bucks that‚Äôs a big time ROI. I spend that to take my wife to the movies and get 2 hours of enjoyment at the theater and maybe an additional 4 minutes when I get home.
    Big shot over here with 4 minutes
        4 minutes am guessing you guys did it twice then
            I mean yeah have you seen how effective Hitachi's are?
With the right amount of money and brilliant motivated minds, the game could be a long time success
Depends on the timeline for critical updates and how much PocketPair is going to keep in their pocket for Early Access 

BG3 was in EA for almost 3 full years, which included several bug fixes and content updates for Act 1 of the game and kept Acts 2 and 3 for full release. Now PocketPair may have the resources to give that same kind of love and attention to Palworld.
*reckon
    Thank you. This is the only time I‚Äôll thank a grammar nazi
        You‚Äôre very welcome, Capitalist pig! üôÇ
    I scrolled down for this. I re-read the title twice trying to make "reconnaissance" work!

A simple typo to make though.
Already 100+ hours worth of enjoyment in its current state and more if they add more content.
It has a lot of long term potential. It‚Äôs all up to pocketpair and time to see how it develops. But I‚Äôve played over 100 hours and have absolutely loved it
    It's such an odd game. I'm in my 50s and have absolutely fallen in love with it. Been able to put in like 65 hours since it was released.    If they don't or are not able to follow up on this potential it will be one of my biggest what ifs of all games. The potential is endless to make a brand new IP that could be enjoyed for decades.
Honestly, even if in the long term the game ends up falling off, it doesn't matter much to me. Right now there's enough content and great game play to totally justify buying it. You'll absolutely get your moneys worth.
Lots of potential for a long term game. Feels like the game lost a lot of hype cause people (me included) grinded 200+ hours to optimize everything. Had to remind myself that it‚Äôs still just an early access game
    I feel like there is little potential for a long term commitment to the game. Everything is barebones and needs major overhauls to make it actually interesting after the first phase of playing and novelty is over.
It‚Äôs still in preview. They have money behind them now. Microsoft are investing too. They‚Äôre already hiring more developers. I think they‚Äôre going to hit on their targets on what they want the game to be. We‚Äôll get everything in the trailer and more.
Most of my friends and I have already lost interest but we all have 100+ hours, it was a ton of fun and we're now waiting for updates to return. That's just the nature of most gaming, its pretty cyclical.
    Yeah I have around 40-50h on xbox, i quit because of the crashes, but getting a PC soon so I‚Äôll have a better experience. I haven‚Äôt even tried multiplayer yet üòÖ
Palworld did what it needed to, it shook up the world of PokeBros.
    It scratched that itch that Legends Arceus started
        And scarlet and violet turned into poison ivy
    Yah I‚Äôm excited to see Nintendo come back swinging
        I love Palworld don‚Äôt get me wrong, but knowing the poke community I don‚Äôt think they actually would WANT this. Pokemon is kind of like Nintendo‚Äôs COD in a sense. They‚Äôve got a large diehard base and they‚Äôre able to print money with relatively few changes to the formula each iteration. 

They branched out a bit with Arceus, but did you notice how they went back to the old formula with scarlet and violet? They‚Äôve got their market share captured already, it just really isn‚Äôt us. 

I would say Cassette Beasts and TemTem are closer analogues to Pokemon and I‚Äôd like to see those competitors continue to spring up. I would also like to see solid Palworld competitors pop up too, but I think that is going to be a higher barrier of entry for developers given the scale of Palworld and the sandbox element of it.
            They didn't really "go back to the old formula" with Scarlet/ Violet, they were both in development at the same time¬† by different teams. The next generation of pokemon games is when we will actually see what they took away from their experiments with Arceus and if it will change their core approach to the series.
            Agreed but pokemon is still falling and will probably still get more games but I just think that at this point alot of fans will stay back the only problem is people will still buy it and play it for a few days or a week or 2 at most. people complain about pokemon being bad alot anymore but if it's so bad then don't buy it it's probably due to hype or just high expectations for a company that really only cares about money anymore and how many people buy it
                > Agreed but pokemon is still falling

Pokemon on the Switch has sold the most copies of any games in the franchise sans Red and Blue
                ¬†"pokemon is still falling"

This is what being terminally online does to a motherfucker lmao.
                    Yeah, you can dislike Pokemon since you 'outgrown it' but to say it falling off is stupid. It a household name nobody really knows palworld except for gamers.
            The ark style game has been replicated many many times only difference is ark actually keeps improving after they get paid, palworlds devs or what ever u call them have a bad history of letting games die sooo we will see. Nintendo just is stale and honestly the Zelda games r the only games I consider AAA even digital Pok√©mon is a small fan base considering. Palworld hit a sweet spot with it being fun for everyone they would be dumb not to keep it alive
    lmao no it really, really did not.
    For a few weeks, until people realized it had nothing to do with pokemon
        I know it's a meme to compare it to Pokemon but It's funny how you got downvotes for this. 

The game is far more like ARK than anything, monster catching isn't just a Pokemon thing.
        Yeah that‚Äôs what happened /s ü§°
Two words. Sex update
    I have no doubts that modders will accomplish this at some point...
        The first step is models but models are not separated by gender so... They already have two Challenger and i'm not Even mentioning rings for movement and all that


And since is early access any APi could change and break everything.... So we are at years long
            Well, OK overhaul mod manages to change textures based on traits and stuff, so that's already some ways into it XD
        The furry artists are already WAY ahead of you.
    *Palpussy* ![img](emote|t5_4jn9v4|49345)
    üòÇüòÇ
        This game worth.
    Wait.. are you talking about pal with pal or..... You AND your pal? Hybrid pal update. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|dizzy_face)
        There‚Äôs a breeding farm already for pals. I think this dude just wants the game to show them actually doing the nasty
            Or he want to do nasty things..........
The thing is, I don‚Äôt know about the future it really depends on the devs. I know what they said about future content but they‚Äôll have to deliver that fr if this wants to be a long term hype. I really love the game but they led their last game sit on what they had on the start before so I‚Äôm not sure about Palworld. I‚Äôd love them to bring us more updates and content but we‚Äôll have to see. It‚Äôs not gonna be irrelevant if they won‚Äôt give us more content but it won‚Äôt keep too much players then I suppose.
    It‚Äôs true craftopia was in EA for a few years, but once seamless hit they immediately put out a roadmap like they just did with Palworld and mostly followed it to a T. A lot of that time was them learning how to build the bones of what Palworld would eventually be if you were to go and compare it to Craftopia‚Äôs seamless version right now.
    At this point pal world exploded largely and Microsoft is investing into them I don't think they could give up without 1 possibly going bankrupt and 2 ruining any reputation they have right now possibly never being able to make anything again without hate the backlash would be insane
3 it's gonna be extremely profitable this is gonna expand their company alot so In all situations it's a big win as long as they keep it up
I think it'll mainly depend on a few things. 

If they fix the big bugs that the game has

If they continue with updates at a reasonable pace

They improve the end game

Official mod support is implemented

These things will keep the game going for a really long time
Temporary hype in terms of high playercount, longtime potential in terms of content, anyone denying that is delusional.
Long term as long as they stay away from stupid ass in game transactions. Looking at you microsoft.
It took me 10 mins playing the game to know there is huge potential.
They need to add an end game.

They need to make combat not clunky. Including ability to better direct pals and rebalance player damage vs pals. 

They need to fix pal AI, pathing and terrain in bases and in combat. 

But there‚Äôs sooo much potential. If they don‚Äôt fix these things tho people will not come back. First two are biggies.

My game file just deleted and instead of being very sad I‚Äôm kind of relieved. Going to stop playing and come back in 3-6 months when the devs have had more time. Excited to bring some friends back with me too.
    If they would increase player dmg then why would you still need pals? I think the dmg is fine as is.  The player should be a support of the pal in combat dmg wise. Not the other way around imo.
        It‚Äôs honestly a significant problem in the mid game. You‚Äôre pretty much just sitting there watching your pal do all the work because anything you can do is negligible. Add on to that there is very little you can do to direct pals in combat, and it becomes very un-engaging. If they want to keep the emphasis on pals doing the combat damage, adding in more ways for players to interact with their pals in combat would be ideal. Even just a block command that you could time to reduce damage would make it way more engaging.
            More importantly, seeing tour pal destroy the pal you wanted to catch. There should be some weaken option for your pals instead of kill or not kill, so they auto stop
                Kinda like false swipe right?
BOTH, hear me out.

Every game ive ever loved has gone through this process.

1: Astronomical launch numbers, so many people play and its everywhere. Couple months go by and the player count drops, sure, but its hardly dead.

2: Now this is the part the devs come back into play, at this exact point you need a content update for the fans, if you leave it, the game will die, if you get the update right, youre setting loyal fans up for life. This is the most important step, failing this will see the failure of the game entirely

3: A decline in numbers again after the update, but the game is seeing a steady stream of loyal fans, the game has a bright future ahead of it

Im tired of the trend games like fortnite set, that if your game doesnt have 1mill concurrent players its "dead". Or that everyone you know must play a certain game for you to play it. Play what you enjoy, have fun, game your own game. Palworld will have both, hopefully
    Live service games have skewed our perceptions of the game industry.

It wasn't that long ago that a small indie title getting *millions* of purchases in the first week would have been considered a smash hit amazing game, no one would expect it to keep those numbers a few weeks after launch.

Now everyone is trying to act like Palworld is a failure because it's concurrent player count has dropped.
Reckon*

Recon is information gathering, like what scouts might do.
I See it like Ark. Hype, slow decline but solid player base.
Me and my wife are certainly getting over the "must play it" phase. The grind from 40 - 50 is taking forever and we have the 5th tower left. I'm still working on breeding but I certainly feel we are coming up to the end of this play through. Probably wait for more content then get back into it.¬†
It fully depends on how fast they can release updates.
It depends on the future development. They can do a lot with it, or nothing, or all inbetweens
****reckon ü§ì

And it's honestly too solid to be just a fad, especially if all the future updates add as much as is promised.

More importantly imo, they don't even need to build a playerbase of their own, because Pokemon fans have been so thoroughly starved for quality games since the noughties. I still think it'd be important for Palworld to build and identity and fanbase of their own so they won't have to lean on the Pokemon fandom forever, but this is certianly a lucky way to start out.
Well dude... i can say both

Majority of playerbase of the "mainstream games" are all based on hype, so these numbers will be lost

But major part of the 450k dudes here will come back when they release new content, and will wait for their second and third games as well.

&#x200B;

Well, as a endgame player im not playing anymore, but im waiting for my sniper and laser gun with my Mewtwo cosplay. ![img](emote|t5_4jn9v4|49348)
If they keep listening to player feedback like fixing bugs, and adding good content, the game could have a very long lifespan
It‚Äôs *reckon* you city slicker
They need to rework the building for it to last beyond just completion
I hope they go the Ark route. More maps, different map exclusive pals. It would be perfect!
The hype will die down and a large chunk of people will leave. But a large chunk will stay, way larger than what they originally expected would come in the first place. 

  
Some people will explore the content until they get bored and take a hiatus, then come back when new content comes. Some people will keep creating their own fun.   


No matter what though, this game developper's put their name out there and people are going to keep an eye out for what they do next, and that's great for them. Also their social media team is great.
If they don‚Äôt fix the crashing issue on Xbox they‚Äôre gonna lose a lot of hype. I play with my partner and when we play we play for hours I don‚Äôt play it alone anymore
the game is still in early access it hasnt even been officially released yet people need to halt the gloom and doom on this game just because it lost some players. Its a good game and as long as the devs invest time and money into it, it will be popular again
Most people I know are already burned out. Less than 100 hours in game and everyone got tired of it
I hope they fix the xbox Version, I'm falling through the map all the time.

After that, I'll be playing it for months
Reckon
I haven't played this yet and I'm hoping for a console port soon so I can, but in the meantime, I hope there is long-term potential. It's good healthy competition for pokemon and any others of the like and that's always welcome. Friendly competition sparks innovation in companies and I want to see what this game can do with a good lifespan.
Who cares. It‚Äôs fun now. Enjoy it while it lasts.
Palworld needs to fix a lot of things and introduce more stuff. If they can do that, I expect it to grow very old. Especially if we get PvP battles.
As a Texan I just can‚Äôt help myself but it‚Äôs ‚Äúreckon.‚Äù
Did you just spell reckon as recon?
I really can't trust a dev with 4 early release titles out...
Just another game at the end of the day
Very strong potential but the Devs don't have the best track record so we've just got to wait and see
I've been level 50 for 2 weeks and just now started being able to touch high tier bosses. I love the challenge level and the need to keep evolving my base situation as I grew/expanded my operations based on needs. The grind to build topped up element themed groups is a little bit tedious but worth it. This evening, I cheered like a loon when I finally bagged Jet for the first time.

As long as PocketPair keeps expansionist coming once they finish fine tuning, I'll be in my little world, happy as can be.
Devs own words: "We believe palworld can be the best game ever if we continue to update it" So that just about confirms they believe it has long term appeal, even if we cant see it from the early access state their vision is clear
On console it'll have a similar life as pubg I think...
Hype will bring people in , but the long buggy/lack of content will drive most people away..
In about 2 years it'll hit. ver 1.0, they'll advertise a lot and bring more people back for a short while ,  it'll then release on PlayStation where it'll get another boost and then fall back down.

Long story short,  it'll get occasional boost in player numbers with big dips down shortly after, never getting to its height again.

I doubt it'll get a sequel, unless they sell the IP to Microsoft or Sony.
On PC it'll have a dedicated niche audience like many other survival games ,
Reckon*
Regardless of what happens to Palworld, I'm expecting the Tem Tem devs and Ark devs to be making competitors as we speak. Palworld has shown that there is market-space next to pokemon here and I'm interested to see how the industry as a whole reacts.
as temporary as pokemon red/blue were.
    Red and Blue are forever legendary
        Let‚Äôs not forget Yellow. The best of all 3 imo
Like most early access games I suspect it'll die off a lot over time with the ones that stay being mostly the ones more invested in the game's development. How fast that happens probably depends on how fast updates come out. And then when it eventually hits a full release a good chunk of the ones who drifted away will come back to give it another go and maybe some of those will stick around playing it for a bit.

Ultimately it's not a live service game and so a lot of people are going to play it, finish it by whatever their definition of 'finish' is and stop playing, but depending on what they add from here onward I think it has a lot of life in it. Especially with support for mods adding extra replayability.

Edit: Personally I'm both looking forward to seeing where this game goes, and looking forward to seeing what influence if any its popularity has on future pokemon games.
Temporary hype, not that the game is bad or anything, it just won‚Äôt sustain the current numbers, and by the time it actually ‚Äòreleases‚Äô no one will care 

It‚Äôs the downside of early access
    It'll probably continue to have user bumps each time content gets released, and considering Pokemon has basically been riding that train for years with their game releases (albeit without actually giving a shit about the game/ content quality or what players want) I think its fair they could easily ride this out for a couple years, minimum. theres a lot of pokemon fans that want that type of content and havent been getting it from game freak.
        Each new Pok√©mon game is heavily advertised tho, they aren‚Äôt gonna heavily advertise each new content patch are they
Hype.  I was over it after 2 weeks.
Already boring üíÄ
I don't think those two things are mutually exclusive.

Pokemon GO had a massive viral upstart, but declined after about a year to only a few million players. Palworld, like all culturally viral games, will likely see a similar trend. Its player count will spike at the start like it already has, and then diminish over time until it reaches a more standard but successful player count. But there is another factor.

One thing that games like Pokemon GO do have going for them that Palworld doesn't, is replayability. Eventually, even with future content additions, someone will complete everything there is to do in Palworld. At that point, there will be very little else for them to do. This will happen slowly over time for more and more players, until eventually the game stagnates and dies. Its an unfortunate but ever present life cycle for non-live service games, and there's nothing wrong with that.

The way I see it, Palworld will maintain a large viral player base for a few months or so, before slowly stabilizing to its normal/expected player count. We'll then see a decline, as we have now, where people are completing everything there is to do in Early Access. Once the game fully releases, it'll return to stabilized normal/expected player count, before once again slowly declining over a few years into end-of-life player numbers.
Very temporary hype, people claiming it's the next "Pokemon killer" after the last few failed attempts will drop this game when development doesn't keep up fast enough to warrant longevity
Temporary hype, although it's cheap enough so that if you want to try it you can without worrying too much.

The problem is it doesn't do anything original or new like other indie games. It's just Ark but with legally distinct Pokemon.
Depends on the devs iq. Many studios would 10x their profit by hiring and continuously developing the game to be better and better. For some reasons many of them don't and just make some other game or whatever.

So yeah, depends on the devs, it definitely has potential if they keep building it.
Long term especially with the tree thingy not being unlocked yet
Temporary hype for most people, but it‚Äôll retain a following long term as long as the devs stick with it and try to innovate.
Absolutely temporary hype
I think it‚Äôs temporary hype but for a longterm genre being introduced. No one had really attempted to challenge Pok√©mon until now, but now that everyone realizes that Pok√©mon are just parodies of actual animals it really opens the door for other people to make their own copies as long as they‚Äôre using original characters. 

Similar to how PUBG is a buggy mess but helped kickstart the entire Battle Royale genre. I think Palworld will do that for crafting+catching genre.
Its down 80% in playerbase basicly since launch. Its like any other early access game thats hyped. It dies fast because its not enough content. After level 50 you farm 3-4 items and you done. Its gonna be popular and have had massive success, but its basicly a single player game and the fun / enjoyment you get from 30 bucks is very very nice and the hype is well deserved. In 2-3 weeks playerbase will be in the 50-100k range and thats fine.
    Why this is downvoted? This is a fact tho. As for 2-3 weeks from now on. No one can be sure. And the content is still barebones
        Because people can't stand it when they get served straight facts when they love something.
        It‚Äôs the palworld sub bro it‚Äôs like going to a nursing home and calling everyone old fucks they gonna get mad
        because it ignores the part where most players have spent 100+ hours in this game
            I did say this game is worth the money, and i have 100 hours in it.
            Yes. The monster catching + base building mechanic does make the game addicted.
I can think of way too many things that could be added, fixed, tweaked. So many directions. Sure it is a pretty complicated thing to mix in this many genres, but I believe they can do it.
It's a game with limited replayability, so people play it then get bored with it. You can consider it hype phase when someone gets excited and plays it and dead phase when they finish it and get bored I guess? Isn't how it works with all games?
Long term potential but there is a lot of work to do before it can be realized
Classic video game. Lose a mass majority of your player base 30 days post release. Some hardcore stay. Classic love service title. People will bounce when they get bored and pop back in when new content appeals to them. Get some brand new players into the game along the while
I just realized that the black dragonesque pal on the far left wasn‚Äôt released in the game. Unless im misremembering lol.
I left playing after my friends stopped because we couldn‚Äôt play together in a closed session and multiplayer isnt‚Ä¶ multiplayer
It's just another grindy survival game in sure it will find it's community but it's gonna be pretty hard to maintain the level of players it had.
Temporary hype is the one, game hit a quarter of its peak search traffic few days ago, Lethal Company still has more consistent support and player base, although scale may be lower
Obviously it‚Äôs temp hype. It‚Äôs meme hype because of how egregious their pokemon ripoffs are
It's hastily cobbled together from bits of other games copied poorly. If they can find their own identity, or just polish this turd well enough, maybe it'll have longevity?
Why did you have to emphasize ‚Äútemporary‚Äù as if the game is going to die immediately lmao. Game isn‚Äôt even version one, it‚Äôs definitely going to get a good amount of players in the future.
    Temp being more the potential to retain a good player count and build a community (like Pokemon). Would be great if this game preserved that community/interest and built a franchise long term by adding new content/updates/innovation, like you said it‚Äôs not even version 1 yet. Apparently the devs don‚Äôt have a great track record so will be interesting to see where it goes.
Temporary hype for sure. The game is a sham. Doesn't deserve the success it got to start with.
    ü§£ü§£ü§£
Lol Nintendo will bury this nightmare AI monstrosity.
Just hype‚Ä¶. This game lacks evrything even animations are poor. You will do the same shit on lvl 50 that you did on lvl 10. 
Boring as fu** game that I can‚Äôt stop playing whenever I have free time to play games. Lol ü§™
With AI coming and how the video game space is evolving‚Ä¶.Yes.
Temp hype unless they can fix the fact it's a vapid survival game with a shitty empty world

Ark kinda worked because nobody gave a shit about the gimmick to care about the world being interesting but Palworld will fail if they go that route because people want the world to be more than just an empty set of biomes where things walk around.
Just another overly hyped game that will not completely die in fact it will likely have a long life but just way insanely overhyped.

Basically valheim
70% of the active player base is already gone, not long now before this garbage fades completely into obscurity
Temporary undeserved  hype 

It combines pokemon with Minecraft and every shooter 
Bringing nothing new to the table and people like it?. 

I'm sorry but I'm gonna side with Nintendo when they sue this frankengame out of existence
I wonder if they‚Äôll go the ARK route where they release new maps with different terrain and maybe even different pals
    I'd rather have them improve already big map and add to it. There's plenty of empty space if they want to add land.
        I‚Äôm looking at you massive tree I can‚Äôt reach
            I was so sad when I hit the red wall üò¢

I had a good thirty seconds of denial. I was like "maybe I just need to come from a different angle"

Then I finally accepted the truth that I would not get to the tree
                You can go "over" the red wall but then there's another invisible barrier thats a bit closer to the tree
                    Fun fact. Technically its not an other invisible barrier, its the collision of the tree.
The fect that pocket pair uses unreal engine 5.1 for palworld and the default collision for a imported model is a  "simple"  collision  what that does is it is looking at the form of the model and than make a collision barrier around the full model fromfrom top to bottom.
But it the gonna set the collision to " use  complex collision" it would look at the model and based on the polygons of the model its would be the same for the collision.
So its really just the model collision and not a invisible barrier 

But i think the devs didn't predict that the players still could find a way to go over it. 

Still a good place to make a farming base as i did  its mostly flat and no other pals or raids comming there
                I, too, tried to go around it. For a good minute I went along the red wall, hoping there would be a way in‚Ä¶
            I will never forget the sound in my friends voice when I told him he was not going to reach the tree, about 3 seconds before he hit the wall.
            Praise the Erdtree
            There is hint In the opening scene something will be done with that tree
        The bottom right corner of the map seems fit for a few new islands and a max level bump.
            There's been talk that the portion available to us is part of a big chain of islands surrounding the big tree in the distance. Could possibly up the level cap, and introduce new islands with new pals that way
                On that note the devs said they‚Äôre planning for 4 major releases, which would correspond to the 3 other corners and the island of the big tree itself
                    Hope one of those updates includes a huge underground system
                They have already stated new Islands would be coming
                The big tree concept sounds super intriguing, like it could be a central hub connecting these islands, and maybe each island has its own unique ecosystem? That'd keep things fresh and give a reason to explore, more than just a level cap incentive. Plus, imagine if each new island came with its own set of challenges or environmental hazards to survive.
                    That's what I'm hoping, something different environmentally as well as the pals that'll spawn

Considering what they put out to start with, I do have hope they could give us something exciting with new islands and such
                    >That'd keep things fresh

So what you're saying is that right now we are in Kanto, soon there will be Johto and eventually Hoenn, Sinnoh, Unova and (checks notes...) _Paldea_.
            According to game code, level isn't hard capped until 80 but it's currently blocked at 50. So there is at least a plan to go to 80 at the moment.
                At 10 level increments. Primary release to 50. 3 expansion releases at 10 levels a piece.
                    Would make sense too, I really don‚Äôt see the next update suddenly adding lvl 80 pals (and the next updates 100/140)
                    In a year or 2 mabye
                I feel like they need to add more requirements for leveling after 50 too. Like to get to 60 you need xp and a certain amount of your paldex filled out or something just to make it a little harder to max out
            I'd rather that be changed into water focused zone, but everything else I agree with.  


I'd like to have to ride a pal with "surf" in order to get out there and then use a pal with "dive" in order to breach the water and explore and catch deep sea pals.
                I get what you‚Äôre saying but flying mounts kind of make that unnecessary. I still would like them to add that kind of stuff as an option. Underwater areas would be so cool. They could even add scuba gear.
                    There are possible lore accurate ways to prevent flying in certain places to make use of other kinds of mechanics
                        I think that would be a bad move personally
                            Don't want caves or underwater bioms?
                                I do but I still want the option to fly over water. Maybe I misunderstood
                        Tbh they should just make your flying pal go back into its ball if they ‚Äúland‚Äù over water while mounted in order to make water pals more useful
                            Not from just landing on water, but maybe if they run out of stamina and fall onto water.
                    Eh, the way the stamina system works with flying mounts, it's more efficient to just take a water mount that doesn't drain stam when in the water for long ocean trips, then switch once you make landfall, rather than starting out with a flyer and having to take frequent rest stops
                    If there's a water mount that surfs faster than flying mounts then they would be viable
                    Flying mounts do make you descend every once in a while which is kind of annoying and a different experience than a water mount, which I'd definitely like.
        JUST LET ME GO TO THE TREE!¬†
            You can "get" to the tree and go past the wall, but there's nothing there. It's currently set dressing.

But that tree is definitely important. All the skill fruits grow on trees seemingly made of paldium. All the dungeon final rooms have a larger tree that is similar to the skill fruit trees.

I have a feeling that big tree is the source of the paldium, the origin of the pals, and likely will be the finale of the planned updates.
                I think it even says as much in the journals or in some of the item flavor text. Something about the energy from the tree making palladium and it's carried through the water which is why all the small palladium rocks spawn by oceans/rivers
                    Great, there goes who knows how many hours searching out the journals.
        YES. LET ME GO TO THE TREE.   
WE YEARN FOR THE TREE.
        I saw someone post an idea where they expand the map with the big tree as the center and the current map is only a quarter of the whole thing. This is now what I hope will happen.
        Based on one analysis somewhere in this sub Reddit, the current map takes up a potential 25% of the total area
        Big map???????????????

I‚Äôve already explored about 70-80% of the map‚Ä¶ the frozen zones are the only places I haven‚Äôt been‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm around lvl 25-30.

Hit 90 of 111 Pals‚Ä¶

Best pretty much all the Pal Bosses up to level 30‚Ä¶

Beat Zoe‚Ä¶ the only boss I‚Äôve fought so far‚Ä¶

Setup a mining operation with Anubis x5, Verdash x3, a water type and a Shadowbesk to haul materials to the chests‚Ä¶

And I‚Äôm bored with it‚Ä¶
    I think that is for a few years time minimum tbh as currently alot of the map is filler.

Not hating ofc as I love the game, but when I first saw how big the map was I was mad impressed, but now I've explored it all I would say about 60% of the larger map is just filler to be there, with no real structures or locations to make it unique
        That‚Äôs what I noticed to, all these ‚Äústructures‚Äù, but they are just scenery.
            Being pre release they can easily work on density as well as expanding.

The map is beautiful,  just lacking in content and story in it.  Even just bumping the spawn rate to 3x makes the world feel so much more alive.
    That'd be a LOT of work for such a small team, but I think they said they plan on adding new islands with some new pals
        not like wildcard was a huge team when they started making ark, were they? palworld has practically unlimited budget right now, i think they could afford to expand the team a little and hire some more artists/map designers if that's truly what they wanted to do. I think most people would prefer them to just add on to the current map though, maybe have a loading screen to a new "region" or something after taking a boat where it's essentially a new map, assuming they can't just keep expanding the existing single map because of performance reasons.
            There was a rumor that the giant tree would become the true center of a bigger map and your be able to select which region around the tree you'd wanna spawn
                this would be very cool
            sadly wildcard bit more than they could chew and it blew up in their faces
                wildcard made truly awful decisions one after another even after getting bailed out numerous times. im expecting ark 2 to be some kind of singleplayer only game, or at least heavily narrative based. it just seems so odd to me they're spending all this time making ARK: SA when ARK 2 is supposedly coming out this year. they're gonna have two competing games in the same franchise confusing new players. why they wouldn't just keep making ARK 2 until it's done I don't know, maybe they desperately needed a cash infusion or maybe I'm right and it's not gonna be a pvp survivalcraft at all.
                    Because a huge percentage of the ark player base has absolutely zero interest in a third person only arksouls conan evolved game. People just wanted ark to work properly and be playable. Unfortunately ASA is the same turd as ASE except this turd has been rolled in glitter.
                        i mean, tons of people play ark in third person. i'm not making any definitive assumptions on gameplay until we see gameplay footage or their marketing ramps up.
                    Well, ARK 2 is going to be nothing like ARK: SA, ARK 2 is a souls like narrative driven game and will be almost an entirely different game from ARK: SA, the only thing that will link ARK 2 to the original ARKs will be the lore and dinosaurs

The reason they made ARK: SA was to please fans of ARK: SE Since most of us didn‚Äôt want a souls like version of ARK, we wanted regular ARK
                        Are you sure about that? I don't think they ever said anywhere ARK 2 *wouldn't* be survival craft, but they said it would have more soulsy on-foot combat, which doesn't mean a survival craft is dead. But idk.
                            Well im sure its gonna still have survival crafting, but last I checked they were focusing on 3rd person souls like exploration/combat which is absolutely different than what we have in ARK:SE/A Which is unique
        They have enough money to hire at least 10/20 devs/designers lol
            Also, Microsoft will be bankrolling them. They want this to become their Mario/Poke/GOW
                Indoubtedly
            100 / 200
            They already have 14 programmers and 5 game designers, for reference.
    There‚Äôs plenty of room on the map to add to and infinite possibilities for new pals, I don‚Äôt see why they wouldn‚Äôt after they get farther through their road map
    I know this isn't a commonly held opinion, but I'd love procedurally generated worlds as an option. Don't ditch the handmade map, but it would be interesting to play different games that have new randomized worlds and randomized pal spawn areas.
    That‚Äôs on their roadmap actually!
    I really hope they expand with more maps or areas. Other than just reworking dungeons every now and again.
    From what The devs somewhat implied, now take it with a grain of salt, is that they're going to add other islands. Now, I saw a YouTuber make a theory that the islands are going to kind of circle around the giant tree in the middle of the map. It would make a perfect full circle, make an absolutely gargantuan map, and give them plenty of new space to add plenty of new biomes, story areas, new pals, new features and functions to fit these new areas, and so much more. And maybe eventually they will add the central tree area to be a playable area. That would be awesome to build a base and its branches way up high
This game turned me from a ‚Äúthis looks okay, I guess I‚Äôll try it‚Äù to a ‚Äúyoooo I gotta get on Palworld and plan my next moves‚Äù type of person. It definitely surprised me. It‚Äôs early access but I truly hope they work out some kinks and nuances, as well as add more to the game. I see it having more potential than it seems and I enjoy this way more than Craftopia (another game this company developed)
    Very much the same. I'm routinely sitting playing other games and think "shit. I want to play Palworld."
        Yeah my backlog went even further because I‚Äôve been playing this like crazy
I think you could add Animal Crossing and Breath of the Wild to that list too
    True
    And a dash of Elden Ring
I am not sure if it is a good fit for purely Pokemon fans. It is a very different game after all
    Hi! Gigantic Pokemon fan here. Palworld improves on the Pokemon formula in every way except IV breeding. I love this game, excited to see what it looks like with more development.

For more context, I love Conan exiles, elden ring, and factorio, but never really liked ARK at all.

Edit: Some of you think I used 'IV' as a replacement for 'for'. lol. I realize not everyone is familiar with breeding in pokemon. IV stands for [Individual Value](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Individual_values) and is a mostly hidden stat boost to a monsters base stats.
        I think the biggest appeal to palworld for Pokemon fans (including myself) is that palworld plays like the Pokemon games have always described the world, even though we never really experienced it in those games.

The Pokemon games always talked about how people lived and worked alongside Pokemon, but we only got to battle. The games talked about how dangerous Pokemon were without your own to defend yourself from them, but you always had one. The games talked about how evil and exploitative criminal organizations were without in any way describing how they could be. (to be fair on this point, palworld doesn't really show the syndicates engage in exploitation either, but the actions available to the player do a good job of filling in the blanks, should you go that route) There's a lot of dark themes hinted at in Pokemon games as well, but it's always got that Disney candy-coating on top that keeps it from ever actually feeling significant.

In a lot of ways, Palworld simply delivers on the *promise* Pokemon games have been giving us for years without following through.
            Totally agree. Pokemon games only ever touch on the dark side through pokedex entries or text. You almost never really see the brutal side of a pokemon world.
                This is why I loved Legends Arceus so much, it started dipping its toes into the darker side, like the casual mention of Pokemon wanting to murder you. But then they threw that away with scarlet and violet, and Legends only just barely dipped its toes in. Palworld just dove head first into the darkness
                    Doesn‚Äôt Palworld‚Äôs reminds you quite a bit of arceus? It definitely made me go hmmmmm
                        Literally the only relation it has is that it's cute creatures caught in balls and it's open world. Totally different concept otherwise if you ask me. The similarities are numerous but it's really not as similar as alot of people say. (I'll admit I've accidentally called some pals by the Pokemon they look similar to
            Such a good way of putting it
        How do you feel about the pal vs pal combat out of curiosity? Despite how much I love this game I think the AI is one of the game‚Äôs biggest weaknesses and I actually do not feel this was an improvement. 

Not saying they can‚Äôt potentially fix and improve the combat AI, but it‚Äôs a little frustrating seeing my Anubis stumped by object permanence when he runs into a pillar during a tower fight. I‚Äôm also not holding my breath on the combat AI being fixed because I think that‚Äôs one of the more difficult challenges to tackle and they haven‚Äôt mentioned it being a priority to my knowledge.
            Honestly its pretty fucking boring without greater control over your pals who cant be mounted. I'm not really excited for pvp until combat is improved from a competetive standpoint.

In terms of fulfilling a monster-tamer fantasy? It meets the mark, and has a leg up on pokemon as you can use many many more monsters as mounts, and even mounted combat
            I think simply adding a 4th move and the option to select which move they use via the radial wheel where you pet and choose aggro would do wonders for this. I'd be kind of surprised if they're not working in the ai, though considering that's a huge complaint of the community and pocket pair seems to listen well.
                I personally wouldn‚Äôt even necessarily be frustrated with them if they couldn‚Äôt fix it. It would go a long way toward making the game a better experience but npc AI seems to be something even AAA studios struggle with sometimes. 

I don‚Äôt know what all they‚Äôre working with, but if they keep putting out content and fixing what they can I‚Äôll be coming back. That just happens to be the biggest item on my wishlist.
            >How do you feel about the pal vs pal combat out of curiosity?

honestly its pretty bad right now, The bigger pals are janky as fuck, and their moves are even more janky. The AI is also pretty bad. Hopefully it gets fixed in the future
        Im ngl ark did the ‚Äò‚Äôark‚Äô‚Äô style survival so bad its not even funny

Conan is a slight bit better but still overall suffers from the same issues ark does but palworld however took that style further and improved on it hard
            All I ever did in conan was tame animals and use them for all my combat anyway haha
        Gigantic pokemon fan here too. I love palworld but I think it's dumb to compare the two. For a start pokemon is conditional turn based which opens the door whereas palworld has no strategy, just shoot
            When my level 25 tanzie is fighting a mammoth, there is definitely strategy. Lol
            Pokemon hasn't evolved that formula in 20 years. All it took was a team to make the pokemon game people wanted from Nintendo for years and it sold like wildfire.
                I love Pal world. They did a lot of great things.

What they did not do is deliver a strategy game; and pokemon very much is. Lots of mind games with the team you bring to a rank match, because you don‚Äôt use all of them; the switches you make mid battle to try to gain a type advantage; the move selection you choose and the type coverage it offers.

And I will **always** prefer evolutions on my creature collectors. I don‚Äôt really like having 2 pals that are clearly related. I don‚Äôt care about world building, I care about how I used my pengullet for 20 levels: I don‚Äôt want to capture a new penking, I want my pengullet to evolve

Palworld **changed** and then improved on Pok√©mon. I still want the open world ‚Äúpokemon‚Äù game too. I‚Äôm greedy sure; but I know Nintendo is too

Edit: ‚Äútiming‚Äù does not equal ‚Äústrategy‚Äù. palworld has zero strategy involved. It‚Äôs an action game where we can use actions to time switches to gain a benefit. But there is no ‚Äúshould I try to dodge, or should I face tank it‚Äù. You should try to dodge.

Double edit: I forgot this sub is full of children who have to go ‚ÄúAcTuAlY‚Äù to every little thing. Thank you for giving me the push to leave the sub
                    If you try facing enemy's 5 levels above you, strategy, assigned attacks and subbing out are very much a thing as your guns do literally 9-11 damage per hit. I'm not to fussed on evolutions myself, as most are unique enough to not seem related in the way you draw lines between pokemon lineage.
                        Pulling Pals defensively to avoid attacks is also something to be mindful of during a fight.
                        I would claim that ‚ÄúSubbing‚Äù in this game is not a ‚Äústrategy‚Äù. All you think is ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to get hit better recall my pal‚Äù. It‚Äôs a test of your timing skill, not your critical thinking skill

While Subbing in pokemon is deciding to give your opponent an immediate benefit, so that you can gain a future benefit; that is strategy
                            Eh, it's still boiling back to live vs turn based, in a live pokemon battle you also wouldn't have time to map a strategy like you do in turnbased, it's tennis vs chess.

Edit: not sure why you blocked me after last reply but OK lol
                                
Then open world pokemon game will still be turn based, just like Arcues/Scarlet/violet‚Ä¶what‚Äôs your point?

Edit: I blocked them for continuing to change what I am trying to talk about and ignoring what I was saying‚Ä¶.this wasn‚Äôt a discussion it was the other user talking at me.

Edit for the person below; I hope you get the help you need friend ‚ù§Ô∏è
                    Turn based combat is a very heavy mechanic in pokemon, but I dont really see it as a defining feature at all and is incredibly boring and dated imho
                        bro turn based combat is like, a hallmark of many s-tier rpg's lol. that's like saying fps is boring and dated because its a heavy mechanic in doom/wolfenstein. (for the record i'm not dissing you for disliking turn based combat, i see what you're getting at)
                            I don't think they were saying that turn-based combat ***in general*** is boring and dated, but rather that ***Pokemon's*** turn-based combat is boring and dated... which is accurate, IMO. They really haven't changed it all that much from the original Pokemon games.
                                Mmm fair point lol. Pokemon‚Äôs rigid formula is incredibly stale and I haven‚Äôt fully played through one since sword/shield, which i found exceedingly disappointing
                                Because it's a solid system and doesn't have to change. If you e played competitive pokemon you'll see that pokemons turn based gameplay is actually very intense, turn by turn reads and plays are wild. If you're into chess and card games, competitive pokemon would be right up your alley. 

What the games need are better stories, better AI, and higher difficulty. And even then, the latest DLC actually gave us an entire zone where every battle was a double battle with the NPCs using real items and strats, they're getting there finally.
                        Turn based combat as a whole will never be ‚Äúdated‚Äù what are you smoking? 

People care about their joints; we can‚Äôt just play button smashing action games all the time. That‚Äôs how you get carpal tunnel
                            I don't mind turn based combat in abstract 2d games but with the modern 3d style of new pokemon games it's pathetic
                                Why?

Edit: *is it ‚Äúpathetic‚Äù*
                        Lol there is a global level tournament for pokemon battling, it is the basis of how the card game works, it's what the anime is based on, it is the core gameplay system of the series for almost 30 years...


How is that NOT a defining feature? You can think it's boring and you're welcome to your opinion but it's a silly stance to take as truth. Is chess boring? Hasn't changed its gameplay in actual centuries yet it's still the most recognized boardgame/strategy game in the world? Is LoL boring for not having changed its gameplay in the 15 years since its release?

YOU might not care for it and that's a fine opinion to have, same as I don't care for shooters. But let's not live in our own mental canon where mainline pokemon games ARENT DEFINED by their turn based strategy elements. That's like saying main Mario games arent defined by their platforming elements. It's a silly take.

It's not boring, it's not dated. It's actually very intense, takes a lot of practice and game knowledge to be good at and has a rich strategic elements. Again you don't have to love it but calling it boring and dated is like calling chess boring and dated.
                "The game people wanted", no, think what you might like, most fans *don't* want something edgy or over the top like Palworld.
                    You can deny it as long as you want, but the majority of people who bought it love pokemon and are keen to see the more adult pokemon world, meanwhile pokemon still tries to sanitise the whole enslaving creatures to cockfight aspect.
                        Or majority bought it for the memes and don't engage in the vocal group that say "THIS IS WHAT POKEMON SHOULD BE LIKE"
                            Like I said feel, free to deny it as long as you want
            PalWorld isn‚Äôt like the Pok√©mon GAMES. PalWorld is like how the world of Pok√©mon is actually described by GameFreak and even the anime.
            "Just shoot" is the same take as "Just press A" in turn-based games. 

Palworld has more skill expression than Pokemon, it just doesn't matter with the current game state because there's no reason to do it.
                More things in common with Pokemon in a way lol. There's lots of knowledge and skill expression in Pokemon that very few ever even touch because the base game doesn't challenge you enough.
            Gigantic Pok√©mon fan here. Pok√©mon was never good because of the battle system. But for the team building and fun world. Palworld just improves that by alot
                Gigantic Pokemon fan here. Team building only matters because of the battle system. The fun world is only an additional part. You remove the battle system, and it stops feeling like Pokemon and just feels like chaos.

Palworld is entirely different because of this. There‚Äôs no strategy. You can actually return your Pals as a move is hitting them to prevent damage and then send them back out. Typings don‚Äôt matter cause any Pal can learn any type move and STAB is negligible compared to other passives.
                    Eh. I've played multiple Pok√©mon games where I shot through with the same team for pretty much the entire game, ignoring the battle system.
                        This is my beef with a lot of the newer Pokemon games tbh. Ever since they turned the exp share on permanently, you don‚Äôt really even have to try anymore for the most part. 

There are some good mods and stuff out there though where strategy is definitely still very important. And that does make for a much more engaging experience imo. 

I do love both Pokemon and Palworld but I agree that they give different vibes - at least when Pokemon is done right or is at a competitive level.
                            You never really needed to use more than one pokemon. You could just overlevel one pokemon and then keep the rest as revive sacrifices.
                    its better than pokemon just deal with it they did what hey should have done palsworld should partner with digimon for their first cosmetic drop
                    That's the thing. Team building in palworld doesn't just revolve around the battling. You have to consider traversal, resource gathering and the environment and time of day. Not to mention the whole base team. If the battle system was the most important thing in Pok√©mon how come the anime, the card game, pokken, mystery dungeon, snap etc still feels like Pok√©mon

There is a lot of strategy. Tho the strategy is different. You have to think more on your feet. There isn't a pause to give you time to plan. Typings matter arguably more than in Pok√©mon because of the simplified type chart..
                        There really isn't a lot of strategy. Game is piss easy, which isn't a bad thing, but you can go guns blazing and succeed more often than not lol



Half the stuff you listed is a bit of a reach. Traversal options don't require strategy. It boils down to use flier or use ground mount. Thats it. 


Hell, you can completely ignore type advantages and still win. It won't even be difficult.
                    >Palworld is entirely different because of this. There‚Äôs no strategy.

Pokemons strategy is exclusively type countering, pokemon also has potions which completely negate using any strategy. Which is fine because the game is designed that way.

Theres a reason why every pokemon game, if you exclusively use your starter you will go through every bad type match up gym completely out leveling them. Not to mention types don't even matter when you can learn adjacent type abilities.
                        This was basically my strat as a kid. Went through every generation up to platinum just using my starter to burst through everything. 

Strategy: grass type? Charizard. Flying type? Charizard water type? Charizard

Except Fire Red, where I was possessed by the rat spirit and went through the game with 2 Rattata that never evolved.
                    So do you like Palworld still or not really. Genuine question.
                    Well by that logic Pokemon has no strategy either. You can steamroll through with just one move ignoring type altogether as long as you level a single mon enough. And that's exactly how I played it when I was a kid
                    I agree! By now I've played Palworld to level 45 with a bunch of friends, beating every single tower boss but Victor/Shadowbeak and capturing every single Alpha pal available. The combat system is fine for as long as shooting up bullets and rockets into pocket monsters seem funny to you. Gets boring really fast, specially if you're hoping to find any tactical approach. It all boils down to variance and design space.

It could be easily remedied by increasing the relevancy of Pal/move types and Unique Abilities. Something easily done and worked on given enough time to playtest and refine. 

For reference: 
ON POK√âMON Type advantage may go up to 4x or 400% move damage. 
Disadvantage may go down to 0.25x or 25% or even 0 (Type immunity)
STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) adds 50% of a move's power to its total power before calculation if it has the same typing as the user.

ON PALWORLD type advantage may go up to 1.4x or 140% move damage. That's 260% less upwards variance than pok√©mon.
Disadvantage goes down to 0.6x or 60% move damage. That's 45% less downwards variance than pok√©mon, 60% less if you consider the lack of immunity in Palworld. (although these numbers might not be precise, they might actually err to less)
STAB on Palworld also adds only 20% to a move's power before damage calc. (confirmed value) That's 30% less impactful than pok√©mon.

The result is a dumbed down version of the pok√©mon battle system requiring little care for choice and variance. Since its conception, pok√©mon gym leaders employ monotype team compositions SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED to give the player an edge by growing a cast with flexible offensive options, instead of grinding your head into a wall.

On Palworld, you can hop on a Ragnahawk or Pyrin with 4 Gobfin on bench and breeze your way through the ENTIRE game. Alternatively, dark-type Nocturnal Pyrin, Frostallion Noct, Helzephyr, Maraith or Nox (These all do the exact same thing. Really, search it up.) and the same Gobfin setup would work. You can easily optimize Palworld by having monotype teams, or teams entirely dedicated to boosting player attack and defense. Which is fine and dandy if it were only an option, and not the playstyle you're forced to take.


Some pok√©mon are allowed to have busted 600 total stats by possessing typing that's disadvantageous to common attacks in the game, such as Mega Scizor, Genesect, Kommo-o, Tyranitar. Alternatively even weak 500 stats are made battle viable through a combination of synergistic typing+ability, such as Eelektross, Spiritomb and Shedinja, having either no weaknesses or being immune to most offensive moves.

On Palworld, none of this would even matter, since damage variance on typing is negligible and there is no immunity for some reason. It's simply damage % stacking upon damage. You can just mash numbers against a wall and it will break, and that's the most if not only viable strategy. This implies a greatly limited design space and variety. New additions to the game will only have bigger and bigger stats with higher damage moves, since that's the only way to make Pals relevant. The current system is made to be powercrept when it could be so much more.

It doesn't help that there is a grand variety of 137 Pals counting environmental variants, with 75% of the "unique" Abilities providing one thing and one thing only: % damage boost. no immunity to anything (such as Lightning Rod or Flash Fire). no speed boost. no speeding up cast time. no conditions to acquire higher stats (such as Guts or Moxie). no applying negative effects (such as Intimidate). no weather effects (such as Sandstream, Drought, Drizzle, etc you get the gist.) Just pure unconditional damage increase. Basically all battle-oriented pals have fucking Huge Power and you can mount on them sometimes. Even then, the most exquisite mount abilities such as active rocket launchers and firethrowers actually just suck, they're extremely underwhelming: completely defeating the purpose of the game's "rule of cool". Seriously think about how cool would be a Pal with weather altering abilities, bringing upon a rain or thunderstorm when it's summoned. Instead we have "Generic Partner Skill Name #78: Boost type damage". or "Generic Partner Skill Name #110: Apply type damage".
                        You competely ignore the fact that in virtually every Pok√©mon game, you can literally get through the entire game if you just use your starter the entire time. Many people point out this is what they did as a kid, myself included. Pok√©mon games require no tactical approach unless you actively introduce it yourself (something I unconsciously started doing myself on later runs/games by purposely swapping out my starter).
                        TL;DR: Palworld is very simplified and basic in combat design (active/passive/unique skills & typings) meaning there‚Äôs very little strategy, even in team building.

You got me with the ‚ÄúBasically all battle-oriented mons have fucking huge power.‚Äù I never saw it like that until you pointed it out.

I also realized that, because any Pal can learn any move, any meta will always boil down to having multiple of the same Pal on your team. Let‚Äôs say you don‚Äôt care about unique skills, Pal A has the highest base attack stat in the game. You would want to use Pal A in multiple forms because STAB doesn‚Äôt matter and move pools don‚Äôt matter. Why would you use Pal B with a lower base attack stat when Pal A does literally the same thing (again, ignoring Unique Skills)? I don‚Äôt think the unique skills are good enough for you to pass up Pal A for Pal B.
                        A very in depth explanation of why this game is too easy.
            How exactly do you look at the Pal spheres, and the "collect em all" gameplay and NOT think Pokemon?
                I think they are saying that the *gameplay* of the two games aren't easy to compare. The aesthetics are a ripe comparison, yes.
            What if palworld added optional turn-based mode. Would that be possible and has any game done that?
        Dude I hated ark there was high level dinosaurs in the starting area that I got spawn killed by every time I tried to get my loot bag
            Yup, sounds like Ark. I love Ark, but I doubt I'd love it if I didn't love dinosaurs. Shit is a nightmare very often. 


And that's before the inevitable bugs.
        Lets wait on judging IVs until we see competitive.  If competitive works around IVs then IVs are not a problem because they would only be an optional carrot you dont need to have.  If people are stressing about IVs without competitive just for the PVE.....that's not a game problem that's a them problem.    


Ain't no content in the game hard enough to require min/maxed IVs.  Also playing around IVs if you wish to is not 100 or 0.  You can easily just say "anything top 20% of IVs is good enough.
        > in every way except IV breeding

I understand why some people like this part of pokemon and other games, but honestly I wish games like this would step *away* from the eugenics grind. It's such a monotonous grind and it feels really bad to me to have a creature/partner that I've been training/raising since the start of the game become obsolete because its great*9 grandchild rolled better stats and passives. Makes it pointless to become attached to anything or care about investing resources in anything until you have whatever broken legend/x/x/x combo
            Hard agree, the IVs part of the stat system should have been left at the soul infusions and not another hidden stat tacked on under the hood. Thank fuck there arent EVs, although I guess condensing and souls are tantamount
        It's missing the rpg element by quite a bit though. At the moment it's just a big sandbox survival.
        Ark had an amazing concept but the devs fucked it up and the game had a lot of inconsistency‚Äôs that weren‚Äôt fixed until too late
        There are IVs in palworld
            Yes, and they're saying Palworld didn't improve on it.
        Really? Palworld improves on pokemon turn based monster battle? Cause I haven‚Äôt seen anything like that in palworld
            I would hardly say turn based combat is a unique experience for pokemon, not at all what I think of when I say 'the pokemon formula'
        Not at all, I don‚Äôt see any evolutionary or shiny pals nowhere, I don‚Äôt see a good story anywhere here, the games are separate experiences and should be treated as such
            I think the vast majority would disagree just because they dont evolve or come in a slightly different shade of purple... the overlap in core game mechanics is quite enough to justify a comparison
        The way you used ‚ÄúIV‚Äù bothers me despite it being cunning. Take a upvote

Edit: I forgot to say leave my presence.
            What about it bothers you? I didnt use it as a replacment for 'for'. It stands for Initial Value, which is a hidden boost to base stats and a breeding mechanic that exists in both pokemon and palworld. Historically it has been a pain in the ass to find out what these values are for newly hatched pokemon, but recently they have made it incredibly accessible. If palworld wants to keep the system, I think its best to make them visible to players without the use of calculators or mods
                Double entendres

                This is the first time I‚Äôm seeing my comment not show because of an edited post. That‚Äôs actually weird lol.
        Something about your use of the Roman numerals there ticked me off... and i hate you... but since i don't wanna seem like a bad guy I'm gonna express that using an anime girl meme so i come off as a fellow degenerate

https://preview.redd.it/q2gkxbbaf6jc1.jpeg?width=732&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=29b1298cb05d69365f319a6a747e2361c44a6c06
            There are no roman numerals in their comment. There's Individual Value (IV) breeding.
            IV breeding? That's just the font. He's talking about breeding IVs, what Roman numerals are you talking about?
                IV =4 used for "for" in this context. I don't understand what you mean by font...
                    IV is Roman numeral 4, yes, but he's talking about "Individual Values" or IVs.
                        ...

I would have literally never figured that out without help... and yet... i STILL don't know what that means. The individual value thing...

                            Pokemon define their stats by base stats + IVs. IVs are stats that are added to the pokemon each level depending on what kind of pokemon you have battled and gained exp from. Some pokemon will give you attack, some defence and some speed etc.. When you breed two pokemon the offspring will have bonuses depending on the parents' IV, I don't know exactly how that works mechanically but that's what "IV Breeding" means
                                Damn. I never knew this a thing. Thanks for teaching me about it. ![img](emote|t5_4jn9v4|49342)
                            Individual Values means that every Pokemon and Pal has a range of stats it can have.  
  
Not every Grizzbolt will have the same HP, Atk, and Def even if they have the same passives.
    This is what every pokemon fan has wanted our whole fucking lives dude
        As a pokemon fan I can confirm, palworld is what legends arceus should have been, sure it has glitches, sure the pal base AI is a bit doo doo asscheeks, but it's in early access. The graphics are many leagues above too, sure it was on a switch and this one on PC but look at the zelda open worlds, they look just a bit worse. So in conclusion if P: LA is Daniel, then Palworld is the cooler Daniel
            Damnnn, Daniel
        I really hope it motivates Gamefreak to innovate.  They have the biggest IP in the entire world and haven't had a single innovation in nearly 30 years.  Seriously, what's really changed with Pokemon now vs 30 years ago? Color? 3D? Different types of evolution?
            Part of the problem is Pokemon is owned by 3 companies, Gamefreak, Nintendo, and the Pokemon Company. I doubt all three heads of Cerberus can agree on a new direction when theyve grown so fat on what they do.
                Nintendo wants the game squeaky clean because they have always put themselves first and foremost as a family company. 

Gamefreak wants consistency and money, so no innovation.

And PC barely knows how to code a game to begin with.
                    > Nintendo wants the game squeaky clean because they have always put themselves first and foremost as a family company. 

Well, most of the time anyway. For Bayonetta 2 the Link costume originally [had no cleavage at all](https://www.siliconera.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/cho_009.jpg), because Platinum Games was worried about exactly that squeaky clean attitude. However, when they took the designs of the Link, Peach, and Samus costumes to Nintendo for approval Nintendo [asked them to add cleavage to the Link outfit](https://www.siliconera.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/20141024_014750.png).
            Game freak rakes in massive profits and continues to sell more games than anyone churning out the same crap. They have no incentive to invest in something like this, their current formula prints money.
        Eh, I loved palworlds and it was amazing, but it‚Äôs certainly not what I wanted my whole life as a Pokemon fan. I think the more hardcore fans that are in to competitive and nuzlocking and the sort don‚Äôt really care for combat, stats, or really anything besides the collection portion of the game. The survival, building, and collection aspects are what I loved about it, the Pokemon aspects not so much, very different games and reasons for enjoyment
            You realize that there are ton of pokemon fans, competitive types are a minority of the actual players.
                ‚ÄúThis is what every Pokemon fan has ever wanted‚Äù and I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true, even not on an exaggerated level. I think there are a lot of fans of the game that aren‚Äôt just in it for collecting the Dex. Was just giving the more hardcore community a shout because they DEFINITELY wouldn‚Äôt compare it, and there‚Äôs thousands upon thousands of those people, so it‚Äôs really not that small of a group. Have quite a few friends that just play the mainline games once or twice and don‚Äôt get too into it and even they agree it‚Äôs really not all that similar.
                    That last group you mentioned is most likely the biggest part of the Pok√©mon audience. Those that play the games a bit maybe finish the main story.
                        Yeah completely agree. It‚Äôs a smaller percent of people sure, but we generally play the games dozens of times through in different ways or have much much longer playthroughs. It‚Äôs also a much higher percent of people playing it year long instead of when the game releases or every few years when they have the urge to
                            Which is why palworld is exciting because it's an evolving world. It's not locked in place. I can come back in 6 months and the game could have changed alot. If I come back to scarlet and violet i get to pay $30 bucks for a couple hours of new stuff. And then wait a year for the next $60 game drop
                                Yeah, I‚Äôm super excited for the future, 60 hours for a 30 dollar game is already worth it to me, I‚Äôm sure in the future, especially with modding, this will be a multi 100 hour game
                    Yeah Palworld doesn't give me the same feeling at all. I'm not a competitive player by any means but sometimes come back to play some of the more challenging firered rom hacks. 

The main problem with the Pokemon main series for me is the difficulty. You only really scratch the surface of the combat mechanics because the game is so easy. 

Another one is content. They had some neat mechanics like the Pokemon contests. Wish they would extend on stuff like that.
            So the majority of longtime Pmon fans myself included agree with the previous statement lol, you don't speak for us in any way, shape, or form. And the competitive circuit is It's own community, most people don't want lumped in with the min-max crowd bc they suck all the fun out of literally everything lol
                It‚Äôs not just competitive min maxers, it‚Äôs nuzlockers, challenge runners, shiny hunters and several other categories. I never claimed it wasn‚Äôt majority, I just think saying it‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs or even almost everyone‚Äôs is just wrong, probably 70% or so would agree, but a lot of people see very little similarities between the two besides ‚Äúcollective monster in ball‚Äù. There really isn‚Äôt much strategy involved with the game and that‚Äôs a huge part of Pokemon for A LOT of people. Disregarding huge portion of the community (even if not the majority, there‚Äôs still A LOT of people that are in one of these groups)
                    They're not meant to be compared directly lol, see this is why people say yall suck the fun out of everything. There's plenty of strategy in it's own right. Choosing the right pals/techniques for an encounter makes it much easier, is that not strategy to you? Just bc you can do more in the moment than stand around giving commands doesn't mean it's not strategic. And nuzlockers would live it. I'm doing a no catch run rn where I'm going through the journey without crafting or using a single sphere. Shiny hunters would enjoy the hunts for lucky and Alt types, and I'd love to hear about these other categories bc it sounds like you're just moving goalposts for the sake of not being wrong.
                        ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not meant to be compared directly‚Äù

Ok so I‚Äôm right and it‚Äôs not what we‚Äôve been waiting for this whole time lol, if they aren‚Äôt comparable than it‚Äôs not what we waited for it
                            No you're just deluded and think you speak for the community as a whole, which your ass backwards opinions contradict. I don't know a single pokemon fan that isn't absolutely insufferable as a human being that doesn't think this game is cool. You can be triggered all you want but yes the majority of Pmon fans think palworld is awesome lol.
                                I‚Äôve literally said multiple times I don‚Äôt speak for the majority? Just a large group of people lol, just stop, I‚Äôm not responding anymore to this needless agression
        lol. lmao even
        Is it? I thought Pok√©mon fans wanted an actual JRPG instead of a mediocre survival game with a Pok√©mon gimmick slapped on top of it. I just don't see how this game has anything to do with Pok√©mon once the honeymoon period of monster collection fades away.
        You guys wanted a survival craft game? My brother, you did not have to wait all these years.
    My wife grew up on Pok√©mon. Still has her card collection but has lost interest in the last 10 years. They just keep rehashing the same game formula with occasional, uninteresting spinoffs that dont provide much replay value. The closest thing they made to a Pok√©mon game for adults was the Ryan Reynolds movie.

We have about 70 hours combined in palworld (mostly her), and she says this is the kind of game pokemon should have made.
        everyone who likes Pokemon has been saying the same thing and its damn true
            Not me.
                I think Pokemon Violet was a lot like Palworld. Because  once I got to the part you are supposed to walk up the hill to school, I just explored the entire map climbing mountains and catching Pals instead.
        Pokemon is never gonna rehash itself to be an entirely different genre. It would be silly. Palworld is ARK with pokemon and that's it, expecting pokemon to drop its entire battle system and genre(which is a global esport with monetary prizes btw) to chase a new genre is absurd and would alienate its audience.

No one who actually grew up with pokemon wants palworld as the future. Even romhack makers don't make stuff like palworld, they create rpgs with pokemon. That's what they always have been. I'm glad you Teo enjoy palworld, but to say pokemon should've made a game like palworld is so disconnected from what pokemon actually is.

I've seen this sentiment lot of people wishing pokemon would be like palworld and the reality is no it shouldn't be.  Pokemon is nearly 30 years, growing every year, catching new generations of fans and keeping plenty of old ones doing what they do. Can there be a survival game spinoff? Sure but that's not pokemon, that's a survival game with pokemon and frankly I think the idea of automation via pokemon slaves would be pretty shitty world building wise.

Is it formulaic? Yes. But that's why pokemon works. I'd rather pokemon keeps IMPROVING at what they do, and not lose their identity. No other major player does what pokemon does in gaming. And yea the games need better performance and more story, they absolutely have room to grow, WITHIN their field.

Anyone saying Palworld is the kind of game pokemon should have made is detached from what pokemon really is and has their own mental canon of what it could be. We don't need "pokemon for adults". Pokemon is for everyone. In the same way that disney movies are for everyone.
            Theres people who played pokemon r/b/y/g/s and stopped. Being a pokemon fan doesnt mean youve purchased/played every game in the franchise. This game works well for people who only played gen 1/2 pokemon and happen to like survival games too. Ask someone if they enjoyed valheim, ask if they played pokemon red/blue. If the answer is yes to both theyll enjoy palworld.
                What part of RGBY would match palworld? If anything people who played the more modern games that actually are open world (legends arceus and SV) are more likely to enjoy palworld if only because the open world design similarity. A thin connection but a bigger one than saying "oh you played pokemon 25 years ago? You'll love this survival game where you collect monsters." There have been plenty of monster collector games since, it takes more than catching monsters to be a good game.

It's disingenuous to conflate pokemon gameplay to palworld and i really don't think there's any connection. Hell my palworld friend actively does not like pokemon and never has and he loves palworld, because they're not the same.
                    You‚Äôve got such a rage boner that you‚Äôre conflating everything i‚Äôve said. I‚Äôm done talking at you, if you want discourse i‚Äôll come back later when you‚Äôve had your juice box and chill out.
    Agreed. I miss evolving the Pals. I have never played enough Ark to immediately like the building and producing parts. Had to really spend hours in the beginning since I had 0 experience, so picking a place for my 1st base was done at random.

But the Pals walking outside, the world being not so empty as the latest games from Pok√©mon, that's all a dream from a Pok√©mon player (who played mainly during HG/SS). Collecting Pals, having shinies (unfortunately not entirely like I would have wanted), breeding, eggs - that's the things that make for a fit as well.
        Pokemon could easily take inspiration from other games to make different genres too. Like a pokemon cozy farming game would be amazing. Like rune factory or even what palworld does on a surface level.

I enjoyed the turn base RPG of Arceus - it was fast paced and kept me engaged. But it was basically it's only mechanic so the game got old for me much faster than palworld. I'm about 100 hours in on Palworld and I only did about 20 hours on Arceus.

One game was $60 and the other was $30. I think Gamefreak has an unreasonable release schedule, but as long as 20 million people buy their games full price every year they have no reason to change anything.

Even with palworld being a success they again have no reason to change anything because fans will still buy their games.

Until sales take a downward turn they aren't going to budge.
        Evolving pals just lowers the amount of useful pals in the game, same as pokemon.¬†
    I'm a purely Pok√©mon fan and I've really been enjoying every aspect of Palworld. Gives you a lot more freedom for what you can do with your critters compared to Pok√©mon and I really like that.
    It also seems like they are developing an rog aspect. imagine if they added towns larger towns in non start areas and trainers that you can fight. theres already one guy who has in inferam as his pal chillin on a hilltop
    *Pulls out butchering cleaver*

It‚Äôs a tad different 

*(Pixels and slicing sounds)*
    Them custom sliders can make it manageable.
    Have a friend that hated ark, loves Pok√©mon. Loves pals. I think it‚Äôs a very good fit for purely Pok√©mon fans. It‚Äôs something different after years of similar game after game
    >I am not sure if it is a good fit for purely Pokemon fans. It is a very different game after all

yeah, its the game fans have been praying for, perfect for pokemon fans
    I keep trying to tell people they‚Äôre completely different games. If someone told me they loved every single detail about Palworld and wanted something similar there are about a dozen games I‚Äôd recommend before Pok√©mon unless they told me their favorite element of the game was the Pal Deck. And even then, it wouldn‚Äôt be the top recommendation.

I‚Äôd say the same thing if the story were flipped and someone wanted pokemon-likes. They are just not similar games at all.
        To me, I explain to pokemon players that Palworld is what I had hoped Pokemon Arceus would be like
        I love riding with Zoe & Grizzbolt! ü§™
        They are very different games. They are very similar brands/IPs. The majority of people who play Pok√©mon play it because if the IP and aren‚Äôt particularly attached to the gameplay. If a Pok√©mon fan is dissatisfied with the quality or diversity of gameplay, which is a *lot*, this is an excellent choice.
        they are different, but as someone who primarily plays Pok√©mon, it was enough to make me want to play this game. I also really liked cassette beasts. I think it‚Äôs got potential be a genre that really only Pok√©mon occupied before.
        Out of curiosity what games would you recommend?
            Conan exiles and Ark are the big ones I‚Äôd assume
                Grounded too!
    You can change the setting to make it just like Pok√©mon actually
    As an almost 33 year old Pok√©mon fan can confirm this is the game we‚Äôve wanted our entire adult lives lol
    My husband does not like ark or conan, loves Pokemon, he loves this game.
        The theme is pokemon-esque (which is really just monster catching) but the gameplay is still Ark/Conan.

I loved the concept of Ark but raising an army of dodos and spitters over 2 days to eventually whittle down and capture a raptor got old quick when it took 2 days to get to the taming the raptor only to die a stupid death and have it lost to the map. Then try and find another, succeed in taming, get mobbed *and it's gone*. 

Then I didn't play for a day and my dodos all died of hunger. Then I jumped in my friend's server and saw a 30 day timer for for a brachiosaurus, and noped right out.

Ark was amazing, but it took the survival stuff to the extreme and turned it into a job. Palworld has all the accessibility Ark lacked (I only played the first at launch so no idea if it changed).
    It‚Äôs everything that the older Pok√©mon fans who grew up with the franchise have always wanted imo
    The game is different. The brand is very similar. Most Pok√©mon players don‚Äôt really care about Pok√©mon‚Äôs gameplay as much as the brand. Having a game that‚Äôs higher quality while providing something other than the same formula is very welcome for those players.
        Which is also why this is a flash in the pan. Pokemons longevity stems from its designs and the comfort of its systems. It might get samey for people after 30 years but it's a continuous guarantee of what you're gonna get and that keeps people coming back when they have that itch. It also has much larger audience as a brand. Card game players, merch collectors, anime enjoyers.

But they always stay for the merch and designs, and that has staying power. Palworld doesn't have that. It's a survival game and while a good one, it's not really a name worth remembering in a year or 5 years. The Pals by and large are forgettable, and the aesthetic of the game is very much  a unity asset store vomit outside of the pals (which themselves are mostly model redesigns of existing pokemon)

It's new gameplay with pokemon at home and once that wears itself out people will move on. Which is a shame cause if palworld had been more unique and focused on its brand it could have grown, but this was a small company and it's not exactly easy to make a successful monster series.

What was closest? Neopets? Even that died in time. The actual successful series are under big corporate umbrellas. Pokemon has nintendo,  digimon has toei/Bandai. Yokai watch has also decline but it too was heavily under nintendo umbrella as their publisher. Its not cheap to create dozens of monsters that have lasting appeal and a world building skill to match
    Is don‚Äôt like ark and I don‚Äôt know what Conan exiles is and I love Pok√©mon since 6th grade when red came to the states.  I love palworld I can see why you think it‚Äôs not a great fit for Pok√©mon lovers but I think at its heart it‚Äôs a Pok√©mon game it‚Äôs the only way to level significantly.  I love this game.
        >Is don‚Äôt like ark and I don‚Äôt know what Conan exiles is

So, picture ARK, but with two main changes:

1. Instead of being mostly on tropical/subtropical islands, it's set predominantly in an Iron Age desert (also features some jungles, arctic wastes, and a volcano, but the desert region is both central and ***big***).
2. Instead of fighting and taming dinosaurs, you're primarily fighting cannibals, bandits, and slavers, and are yourself enslaving them (there's still animal taming, but it takes a backseat to the slavery).

...actually, a third important change, too. You can climb up walls like you can in Palworld and Breath of the Wild. I *think* Conan: Exiles might actually have been the first big game to do that, but I'm not certain.
    I would say the opposite I think it's shares alot or aspects with Pok√©mon in alot of ways and there is nothing wrong with that
    It reminded me a lot of Pokemon legends Arceus which is currently my favorite Pokemon game; right down to the "catch multiple of the same monster" stuff
    Correct. Yes they have a catching mechanic like pokemon that even better than the pokemon games BUT they don‚Äôt have the storyline, the battling (except for the towers), they don‚Äôt have the gym battles, etc‚Ä¶ 

I love pokemon and pal work definitely kicks it up a notch but I do wish there was more towns, a story, gym battles, etc.. 

The game is early access. Who know where it‚Äôll go and that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm excited for the most about this game!
    Yea game really isn‚Äôt that much like pokemon, battle mechanics are butt currently. I find myself frustrated with how often my pal just wonders around not attacking a boss or the boss completely ignoring my pal to target me.
This. All of these are my favorite games including Palworld. Haven‚Äôt played it much the past week, but I have around 60 hours and am renting a server to play with friends. 

I‚Äôm sure my interest will wane and I‚Äôll pick up another game until the next update, and I‚Äôm cool with that. It‚Äôs a really fun game and worth the 30$
Even if you like rust, you fit, only thing you miss is pvp which they will add overtime
This comment is on Chad levelüëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº
The game reminds me more of Prime Fortnite Save The World (the original game before Battle Royale took over), especially with the shield mechanics, regen system and the abilities.
[deleted]
    I wasn't a puppy-kicker before, but palworld helped me change and grow as a person!
Definetly not. It's a good fit if you happen to like all those games at the same time. It's definetly temporary hype, but it won't die if the developer won't let it. It will keep a small but regular fanbase, imo
Not an accurate statement. Those have PVP
And in the grand scheme of gaming survival games are a niche. Palworld is really just another gaming fighting for a tiny piece of land.

The worst thing about Palworld is its exclusivity to Xbox. I‚Äôve enjoyed the game thoroughly but the fact that hardly anyone owns an Xbox its suffocating its potential playerbase. Same exact thing happened to Valheim.

PC gamers aren‚Äôt going to stick around either because they just jump on whatever the newest trend is every other week since they get 15 trillion new games every year.
110 hours right now, level 48, definitely gotten moneys worth and I‚Äôm still excited to play it tonight
    Around the same and can confirm it was well worth it.

Usually with games I go hardcore and feel like I have to grind constantly. With this game yeah I grind when I do play, but for some reason I don‚Äôt feel like I have to. The game has so much to enjoy in the various aspects that I know I will play again soon, but don‚Äôt feel pressured to.
Totally agree with you. Was kinda shocked when a buddy of mine wished there was some stuff in it (i dont think he considered it early access) and was bored after 40 hours while he was only lv30 and had still loads of stuff to do. Then again i know he quits games very often midgame.
    There's almost zero story. Pokemon isn't about catching Pokemon, it's about becoming a champion. 

Palworld just has traces around the map and some boss fights.  The majority of players need a path to follow.
        Yup that is in fact valid criticism, in a sense that the game appeals more to the   
1) survival - basebuilding - creativity - exploring formula  
2) gotta catch em' all addictiveness  
3) looting and leveling game-loop (obtain stuff to obtain more/other stuff to obtain more/other stuff etc) 

Personally, 1) doesn't catch me as much as others, I barely decorate as the stuff costs research points that I rather spent on stuff that "does something". However, totally fell for the 2) Paldeck and had to explore and catch everything there was, long before the level of my character/ game would  have me leave the early areas. 3) never really hurts, could've done with less, wouldn't mind more.

The boss towers and I suppose end of the game (the island with the tree..?) were afterthoughts for me, didn't care at all (100hours in and only did 2 towers, haven'g gone to the big tree) but I absolutely see how this type of open world would not work for let's say pokemon players that rather have a narrative and prefer a straight path to progress along
            The game has everything but doesn't shine in anything

Base building is barebones, farming/pet management simulator is barebones too

Figts need balancing

Story non existent

The game is absolutely worth the money, but it has very big room for growth
                Yep. I‚Äôd also argue the tower bosses are‚Ä¶ just there. Even the lowest level boss with Grizzbolt? Is way harder than the content around it. 

The other bosses except maybe Lily are super tough. 

We need to bring the tower bosses into lore other than the logs, because they are kinda just there. Optional content as such.
                    The lore, loosely from what I‚Äôve gathered, is that the island used to be ruled by the legends. People and pals lived in harmony. The tower bosses are the leaders of the various groups that changed the landscape by outcasting the legends and humans alike and taking power for themselves. This is why there‚Äôs relatively few unallied humans and the legends live off in their little corners.
            Just FYI you can't make it to the big tree without glitching around the skybox.
            I hope they can change the research point system. I wasted so many points on early items because at that point you could afford everything. Now in the tail end of the game I have to hunt down manuals to unlock what I really want to use.
        I don't believe the majority of players need a path to follow given how many sandbox games are extremely successful.
            Which? The major souls-likes  have a story. Zelda and Skyrim have side quests. Minecraft is probably the one exception.
                7 days to die  
Terraria  
Factorio  
Rimworld  
Ark (mostly)  
Mount & Blade  
Valheim  
Enshrouded
                None of those games are survival sandboxes.

Survivals sole point is you‚Äôre gonna need to explore if you want to survive/progress.

It‚Äôs a genre that really doesn‚Äôt need heavy story elements other than explaining why you‚Äôre in this mess.
                Minecraft, Roblox, Fortnite, GTA, Ark, etc.
        There is some story with the adventurer logs and stuff. Also build your own story based on what you see. There is a reason why there isn't a path to follow.  It's a sandbox game
            Calling the adventurer logs a story is a joke and you know it
                I wouldn't call it a story, more of background information and observations on pals, the world and the various bosses.
                Yeah I like the game but thats kinda cope
            It's like subnautica in a sense
        I think story will come after. These journals we find scattered across the map hint at a bigger picture that we dont see yet, or simply havent got access to. We are told that these powers generate some form of energy and need to be protected.
    Just because there is stuff to unlock doesnt mean there is stuff to do TO unlock those things besides grinding, and not everyone likes grindy games
    I stopped playing around mid game. You kindve realize it‚Äôs just a massive world in which the only thing you really do is capture pals while traveling around. Sure there‚Äôs the base building aspect too, but even then there‚Äôs not much a point of investing in that once you have all the crafting benches and whatnot
        Yeh the game feels 60% complete which is what the creators have said


I got bored mid game. The gameplay loop got stale real fast once the initial base building and fun levelling was had trying to fill my paldex of pals


Its not fun capturing 10 of each just to get earn big XP. Its extremely repetitive and feels like a chore. Theres not many other ways to earn enough XP to level up for the end game content like defeating the final boss towers or capturing the legendary pals. 


Im stuck in the mid game with a horrendous grind


Dungeons are just a copy and paste job in each area. No interesting POI's for exploration. No random interactions during exploation that are fun. The little villages are a bit of a joke in that at best they have a pal trader and a standard merchant and thats it
needs some serious upgrades. its cool but dry feeling

The [roadmap](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palworld/comments/19ee4gt/the_future_of_palworld_palworld_road_map/) indicated they plan on adding additional islands.
That's also because people have no chill lmao. Playing for like 300 plus hours. They'll add a shit ton more. More pals and islands are coming.
    I never understand how people clock up those numbers in when the games only been out for so long, like i always feel like i play videogames a lot but ive only hit 400ish on a few games ive played for years
100% agree that the map is clearly 1/4 of the planned space. We've got plenty of future content coming, assuming the devs don't manage to blow through a hundred million dollars before they make it.
Are we looking at the same pic? Every pal in that image is currently in the game.
>Any article about a ‚Äúdeclining player base‚Äù is click bait bullshit.

This reminds me when a company is like "Blah blah sees a 5% drop in revenue after it's HIGHEST QUARTER OF ALL TIME. Layoffs expected."

Like Jesus people can we not just chill and let it play out instead of punishing people by making drastic moves?

This game will be fine as long as they keep updating the game regularly.
    Modern capitalism requires that companies have the highest quarter ever every quarter. It looks bad for shareholders and if they think they won't get their profits they will sell, furthering the issue of profits.

The idea of a company wanting to work on a game out of passion rather than future DLC or future game releases goes directly against what shareholders want.
        As someone who knows nothing about share market and business, cant a company just remain on a shop like level with one guy owning it with hundreds of employee ? Does it always need to be turned into shares type model if it grows successful and large ?
            If they want investments from others rather than using their own money, yes. It's not "required" but most companies that want growth see it as a faster and cheaper way to go about it.
                Not the only way. They could leverage, they could sell minority ownership to one person to retain control, and they can use the profits to grow. Speaking as a business owner, incorporating is NOT even close to the only option.
            It can, see Valve for an example of a company staying private.

But it can be difficult to get serious amounts of investment money into your company without the prospect of turning into a public share model company.
            There's plenty of large private companies but private investment is generally more expensive than public. And much less liquid
                Not to mention that large private companies tend to have less media coverage precisely because there's not as much public interest in their performance.
            [deleted]
            If you have investors. They want a higher bottom line every quarter or there will be changes. It honestly kills a lot of games. And I don't know if this is true.. but I heard in the US if you knowingly do something that will cause that bottom line to shrink... Even if it's good for the long-term of the company you can be outed from the company.
        This isnt capitalism this is if anything this comes from confuscionism and arguably socialism. As this sentiment that games always need to be played year round comes from the gaming markets in countries like china and s.korea, where games that can be played year round day in day out are hyper profitable. This is becuase those two ideologies have created societies in which a huge % young men at the bottom have no chance of bettering their lives romantically or economically, so they can afford to and have the time to literally game all the time. Western devs have seen this and are now trying to take adv on western economic downturn aswell.
        Your first paragraph is so far off base‚Ä¶ just shows how many uninformed people there are out there.
Yeah, I mean just about every game will have a ‚Äúdeclining player base‚Äù. Any big game is bound to have millions and millions of players playing on release and those players will do everything they wanted to do in the game and put it on hold until updates
    Yeah. It didn‚Äôt take long to 100% the game. I spent a little time working aesthetics after that and then it‚Äôs either pause the game or do the breeding grind. 

Frankly I put enough hours in that I‚Äôm entirely satisfied even if I never pick up the game again. 

But it will need some more depth for real replay-ability.
    Exactly. The fact that an *unfinished* game still has **315k** players online, on Steam alone no less, a month after dropping with *severe bugs and unfinished content* is a pretty good sign.
Pocketpair called those articles lazy as fuxk. Declining player base is to be expected, since players are starting to exhaust the early release content. I myself finished everything in 77 hours and started playing Lies Of P, but will definitely come back to Palworld when there are updates.
    Funny, I was actually playing Lies of P when this distracted me :)

But yeah, if it isn't an always online game like an mmo something declining user counts is just business as usual.

Once I am done with this I will go back to P as well probably only returning once it has hit official release to do a fresh playthrough.
> Any article about a ‚Äúdeclining player base‚Äù is click bait bullshit.

The funniest bit is that all these articles talk about the **massive** drop in players and well, this "failure" is now only the most played [third party game on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed).

Oh no, 3rd place behind Counter-Strike and DOTA. How the mighty have fallen.
    CS and Dota are free2play it‚Äôs kinda crazy it surpassed them in the first place as a paid game.
    Just look at it now‚Ä¶ I guess those stupid journos were right after all??
        Oh no, 9th place, and 4th place for games that cost money.

What's funny is that 1st through 8th are all live service games. I mean, unless you think people aren't buying GTA V for GTA Online.

Edit: They just announced a raid and have been fixing bugs since launch. I think they'll be fine, barring the CEO of Pocket Pair picking up a cocaine addiction or them never leaving early access like craftopia.
yah lol, as time progresses people will "beat" the game and drop it to wait for new stuff, Elden ring is a masterpiece but after you beat it there's no much reason to replay unless you want to play diferent builds
This is not a online game that force you to play daily. Most player who bought this game at launch would have already finished first play through and sit back to wait for new content. Of course the active player will drop.
Brain rot from multi-player games. Only reason these articles are made is because fucking modern day idiots compare multi-player games vs singleplayer games in terms of how "alive" they are for active user bases. These morons can't understand that once you "beat" a singleplayer game most people just stop playing and multi-player games are designed to be an endless gameplay loop...
    > These morons can't understand that once you "beat" a singleplayer game most people just stop playing and multi-player games are designed to be an endless gameplay loop

Lol they're well aware, my dude. They write click bait bullshit because their job is to write click bait bullshit because the kind of dumdum that clicks on click bait bullshit is also more likely to click through ads.  Journalism sucks because people don't want to pay for journalism.
        Yeah I was mostly referring to the mindless consoomers and dumbasses in general talking about player count it's always all about the money with business
The "decline" is part because people like me, who love the game, but don't have all the time in the world. I haven't played in like 2 weeks. So I count as a player leaving the game. But I'll be back. Oh, I have big plans for my playtime with this game. Don't you worry. I've also only played on gamepass and plan to grab it on Steam here soon.
    I stopped playing it because it felt unfinished and I want to come back later. So, there‚Äôs that reason too.
It makes sense people beat the game and are moving to other things,  I'm not sure why that's shocking lol
The devs seem like they have a good mentality for this.  They pretty much said of course the player base will go down after people have been grinding it for weeks that‚Äôs natural.  Go play other games and come back when you‚Äôre ready or when they drop a content update.
I mean it might make sense to make an article like that for an MMO or a Game As A Service model, but for a game with a linear story that isn‚Äôt massive, who cares if lots of people have already gotten their money‚Äôs worth out of the game? 

The game far exceeded the devs‚Äô expectations day 1. There is no longer a fail condition. Palworld, despite being early access, has succeeded as a game. I agree that those articles are dishonest and I‚Äôm a little embarrassed for those writers.
Journalism is a fucking joke nowadays.

Journalists like that contribute nothing to society. They are actual degenerates. Useless. No skills. Pieces of shit.
Palworld reacted to the article saying it's ok to move on to other game and that they hope those people will come back and play later and that they love them either way.
Every game plateaus. Even the new Helldiver's 2 is going to before much longer 

But this game won't die for a long time. It already has to many fans and loyalists. People who will never quit playing it and making everyone else wonder why people still play it.

Ark, No Man's Sky, Elite Dangerous etc....they all end up like that. But they keep going because the players keep playing
>There were the same ‚Äúarticles‚Äù for both Baldur‚Äôs Gate 3 and Elden Ring.

Elden Ring declined from \~1M players to \~50K currently so I'd say that's a quite huge decline. You can complete the game in a few weeks, there's no good reason to continue playing it, even tho it has great replay value. For context if Dota 2, LoL or CS2 would go to \~50K players it would be pretty much considered "dead".

I think the issue with Palworld is that it doesn't take that long to complete it, so ppl build all the stuff, test out the weapons, try the pals and they simply quit playing. All who will keep playing for long time probably are base builders. So it probably has to push new content once in a while to keep the playerbase or add new online game modes.
    It's not a fair comparison because unlike those 3 games Elden Ring and Palworld aren't multiplayer focused games.
The steam chart is straight down after the peak on release. Are you just saying the site is inaccurate?
    No.

I cannot believe I have to spell this out, but it is Reddit after all.

It‚Äôs normal for a game to lose players after launch.

These ‚Äúarticles‚Äù are trying to stir up shit from nothing. Palworld still has 500k. Baldur‚Äôs Gate 3 still had like 140k or so. 

These games aren‚Äôt ‚Äúdead‚Äù, the content has just been completed by most players, and people will return when new content comes out.
        Doubtful, it‚Äôs a fad game. I‚Äôm impressed it got so high by just milking the pokemon similarities. Literally Arc with pokemon nothing new or creative. Game will keep falling because people have already played this game with a different skin.

|-|-|-|-|
it's not tho

2mil active players to 300k active isn't a click bait bullshit lie
    It‚Äôs not a game as a service, so the player count doesn‚Äôt matter. People continuing to play the game on official servers actually will cost it money. It made its millions. Now they can hire more staff and build the game up better. Then, when new content drops, players will come back and check it out.

So it is litteral clickbait. The amount of players is a meaningless number. You don‚Äôt need a population. Are you the type of person ‚ÄúGame lost players, bad game, can‚Äôt play bad game.‚Äù?
     And it's still #3 on Steam most players even with that dropoff. So...who cares?
I saw zero articles about the games you mentioned
>Any article about a ‚Äúdeclining player base‚Äù is click bait bullshit

Lol wot.
Why would it be a clickbait? Most of the people finished the game, played 100hours and now won't touch it before the next major update.
Andddd you were wrong!
    Nope. It‚Äôs a single player/co-op game. Nothing has changed.

Elden Ring for example will continue to rise as we get closer to the DLC, hit its peak again during it, then drop once again.

And so will Palworld. It will rise when the new raid comes out, then drop again.
        It has decreased in player count week over week every day since release. 

It has retained less than 5% of its player base.
            Just like any other non-live service game? Like wtf are you even saying?

How many people are playing The Witcher 2 right now???!
                Elden ring did not lose 95% of its player base in a month. Neither did baldurs gate.

I am not even going to respond to your attempt at a comparison because it is utterly asinine and ridiculous.
This just isn‚Äôt true lol the game has a lot of issues that effect Midgame to endgame and take a lot of the enjoyment away, causing players to quit but it‚Äôs hard to talk about when you losers keep screaming ‚ÄúTHIS GAME IS THE BEST LOL L POK√âMON‚Äù
Definitely is not clickbait bullshit lol. I have reached the end of game and there's nothing else to do.
    Yes. Which is NORMAL. Declining player base because users beat the game is how gaming worked for decades before gaming as a service. 

Imagine beating The Last of Us and being like "boy, the player base is declining".
    it's an early acess game? Are you expecting infinite playability?
        At least a way to keep you entertained. Now there's literally nothing to do.
            Nothing to do and nothing *you want* to do are different.
                Mr condenser over here
                    I mean, it's something to do.
                        Tis true. Y'all have fun with that king
            So‚Ä¶ play a new game‚Ä¶ Jesus

    Yeah, the game is early access‚Ä¶. You got a brain?

The development isn‚Äôt done. I think you should stay away from early access and stop playing what everyone tells you to play.
The breading and condensing is a time suck, I‚Äôm in the group that‚Äôs starting to get bored.

I want to go explore but I run out of ammo or spheres and have to go back and make both of them which can take all the time I have to play that day. That dynamic is getting tiresome. I want to play but I get on and have to do chores lol.
    why don‚Äòt you up the drops? Less grinding, more exploring
        Exactly what I did. Every time a portion of the game got boring, too grindy or tedious, I changed the settings, used We Mod or downloaded mods to go through it faster.

Breeding is the best example. I made a maxed out Anubis with LV 5 handiwork. That took forever and wasn't interested in doing that again with other pals so I downloaded a mod to make eggs instantly and one where I only need 1 pal per level to condense.
            Ooo that‚Äôs a really fantastic idea! I don‚Äôt mind some grinding but breeding is so tedious. I‚Äôve never used mods before but I also heard there‚Äôs one that lets you share items in boxes between bases so maybe I‚Äôll start looking into that :)
                Hopefully they're paying attention to mod creation and traction, then integrate the most popular mods into game mechanics.

Like, say, you're happy with your second/third base placement and you want to share resources. Now you have to lay down a rail or pipe system between bases to enable that. Takes time to build and gets attacked as you're building, but once built is safe and makes all materials available.

Or maybe it's never safe from attack and another building near the transfer tiles in the tech tree opens up a command and conquer style game play where you send in pals from the box to counter attack.

Breeding seems to have the most complaints. Create a nursery pal or two that ups high IV odds / makes attaining the perks you want easier. Could adjust them so the benefits from them grow as you breed/capture stronger pals.
            I'm playing the game on hard mode... But I think I'll have dedicated breeding days where I turn it to easy. Because ain't no way I'm waiting days for breeding.

The fact the timers stop the moment you exit the game is insane to me.... Having to play 20+ hours for a large egg.. absurd.

Nothing else grindy bothers me though. I'm happy to not rush through the game like most people, having nothing left to do in game.

Plus, I'm thinking, if you rush to overpowered pals.. then all of the games challenge is Really eliminated. It's not like there's pvp yet. You're just gonna be blasting through bosses and to collecting things, and repeat.

 Now That can get Boring!
                Well as long as people had fun playing at the pace they did it's good. I definitely did the end game stuff faster than most would, but I had fun. Anyways I still have things to do
                Huh? Is that a single player thing? I'm on a server, and the egg timers keep going when you log off. Having to actually wait 20 hours in game is terrible
                    Yup. It's cause servers run all the time
        I‚Äôm preconditioned to believe if I change any settings from normal I will not get achievements‚Ä¶ and meaningless computer awards are more important than streamlining the game to my available time. I see your logic and I will take it under consideration.
        Most casual players are not going to them know where that setting is
    farm gold and find the merchants that sell ammo or materials to be in your base
    Yep, I switched my egg hatch timer to instant and even then I found it way too boring to even bother with, I also upped my mined items boost to 3x once I got to level 48 because the cost of crafting spheres is way too high imo, it's almost like the game doesn't want you to catch high level pals
    Put the breeding eggs to zero timer. The 2 hour wait is purely gimmick. You have better things to do than just kill 2 hours and hope it‚Äôs a good egg or not etc
    Yeah, I don't think I'd have an issue if my mine base actually worked while I wasn't standing afk there. And maybe let me buy palfluids for the cement crafting.
    I want to max out a bee squad (eliz & 4 beegardes) as well as a swee squad, and also multiple 4 member squads for maxing the elemental damage of whatever 5th pal I choose, but I also can't be bothered lmao.
    Yeah you can increase drops by like 5x and then just get a fuck ton of ammo in one trip. No need to grind menial stuff unless you like to.
I am having a grand ol time but I can feel myself nearing endgame on my main playthrough. I've definitely gotten my money's worth, and based on the trailer there's more content to come. I hope they flesh it out more with "full" release and continue to make new games, because I'm having a blast.
Also the game isn‚Äôt even out yet, it‚Äôs early access and surprising polished. Even the AI pathing might be horrible but at least it‚Äôs somewhat functional. I played so many 1.0 games with worst bugs.
Wouldn't #2 in the first week be the very definition of hype though?¬†


Having said that #3 a month in is indeed really impressive! Hope the game keeps doing well and wish the team behind it all the best!
Yep. Will be playing more when updates and things become available. The game will be fine.
    Yeah, at this point I think "will it continue?" is 100% up to devs. At the current point in time it's fun and playable, but content is limited. Unless you get deep into base-building or breeding, there's only so much time you can spend on the game. More pals, more plot, and more map will decide this game's future.
        Honestly the building sucks ass also they need to add more building freedom when it comes to things clipping into each other like imagine building a nice looking roof without it looking ugly or slowing us to clip those triangles into the sides of stairs or leting us clip 2 walls into eachother for an X shape anything the only thing would be rules about crafting stations


In short just br more lenient about objects clipping into other objects to make it easier to make things look nice
        Yeah a story would be great not just lore. It beats Pokemon out in graphics and I guess bugs not being everywhere. Everything else not really. PVP will probably be just shooting, since the pals are AI controlled, there no story. Just lore in books.
    Even if the devs stop after 2 or 3 years, the modding community will keep it alive. It's like Minecraft. Played it from alpha till today, thanks to mods...
No one is playing Palworld for months on end, majority got their moneys worth while playing the game. Yeah it will decline but its not a loss as the devs gotten the money and fans are happy.

It has multiplayer but it isint an MMORPG where oops you need to grab your dailies and fomo!
    Its not even a full game yet lol. So when it fully releases, itll have more content,  and hopefully be more user friendly
    Not just that but it probably has large spikes when a new update releases that  adds stuff
The other massive thing about the game is the devs actually listen to the players, they‚Äôre responsive and proactive on social media keeping people informed of how it‚Äôs developing, there‚Äôs not many of the toxic traits of modern gaming like micro-transactions, abusive chat, etc. They‚Äôve also already stated they‚Äôre looking at implementing a third-party service to prevent cheating. I don‚Äôt play it all the time but I am still really excited to see what the future brings for this game.
After 3 weeks it lost 75% of the players on steam.

Not saying it is a bad game, not trying to insult, but that is not normal for most games. Seems like this game got very hyped and possibly started losing interest fast. And I doubt the hype will be the same or more when it releases. 

I am only talking about % which does matter, but is not the most important. Since 500k is still a fuck ton. 

Bg3 for example lost 75% after 8 weeks. Elden Ring after 6 weeks. 

Not directly comparing them as games, just seeing what is happening. Not meant as an insult or shaming them or whatever. I play this game myself.
Big shot over here with 4 minutes
    4 minutes am guessing you guys did it twice then
        I mean yeah have you seen how effective Hitachi's are?
Thank you. This is the only time I‚Äôll thank a grammar nazi
    You‚Äôre very welcome, Capitalist pig! üôÇ
I scrolled down for this. I re-read the title twice trying to make "reconnaissance" work!

A simple typo to make though.
It's such an odd game. I'm in my 50s and have absolutely fallen in love with it. Been able to put in like 65 hours since it was released.    If they don't or are not able to follow up on this potential it will be one of my biggest what ifs of all games. The potential is endless to make a brand new IP that could be enjoyed for decades.
I feel like there is little potential for a long term commitment to the game. Everything is barebones and needs major overhauls to make it actually interesting after the first phase of playing and novelty is over.
Yeah I have around 40-50h on xbox, i quit because of the crashes, but getting a PC soon so I‚Äôll have a better experience. I haven‚Äôt even tried multiplayer yet üòÖ
It scratched that itch that Legends Arceus started
    And scarlet and violet turned into poison ivy
Yah I‚Äôm excited to see Nintendo come back swinging
    I love Palworld don‚Äôt get me wrong, but knowing the poke community I don‚Äôt think they actually would WANT this. Pokemon is kind of like Nintendo‚Äôs COD in a sense. They‚Äôve got a large diehard base and they‚Äôre able to print money with relatively few changes to the formula each iteration. 

They branched out a bit with Arceus, but did you notice how they went back to the old formula with scarlet and violet? They‚Äôve got their market share captured already, it just really isn‚Äôt us. 

I would say Cassette Beasts and TemTem are closer analogues to Pokemon and I‚Äôd like to see those competitors continue to spring up. I would also like to see solid Palworld competitors pop up too, but I think that is going to be a higher barrier of entry for developers given the scale of Palworld and the sandbox element of it.
        They didn't really "go back to the old formula" with Scarlet/ Violet, they were both in development at the same time¬† by different teams. The next generation of pokemon games is when we will actually see what they took away from their experiments with Arceus and if it will change their core approach to the series.
        Agreed but pokemon is still falling and will probably still get more games but I just think that at this point alot of fans will stay back the only problem is people will still buy it and play it for a few days or a week or 2 at most. people complain about pokemon being bad alot anymore but if it's so bad then don't buy it it's probably due to hype or just high expectations for a company that really only cares about money anymore and how many people buy it
            > Agreed but pokemon is still falling

Pokemon on the Switch has sold the most copies of any games in the franchise sans Red and Blue
            ¬†"pokemon is still falling"

This is what being terminally online does to a motherfucker lmao.
                Yeah, you can dislike Pokemon since you 'outgrown it' but to say it falling off is stupid. It a household name nobody really knows palworld except for gamers.
        The ark style game has been replicated many many times only difference is ark actually keeps improving after they get paid, palworlds devs or what ever u call them have a bad history of letting games die sooo we will see. Nintendo just is stale and honestly the Zelda games r the only games I consider AAA even digital Pok√©mon is a small fan base considering. Palworld hit a sweet spot with it being fun for everyone they would be dumb not to keep it alive
lmao no it really, really did not.
For a few weeks, until people realized it had nothing to do with pokemon
    I know it's a meme to compare it to Pokemon but It's funny how you got downvotes for this. 

The game is far more like ARK than anything, monster catching isn't just a Pokemon thing.
    Yeah that‚Äôs what happened /s ü§°
I have no doubts that modders will accomplish this at some point...
    The first step is models but models are not separated by gender so... They already have two Challenger and i'm not Even mentioning rings for movement and all that


And since is early access any APi could change and break everything.... So we are at years long
        Well, OK overhaul mod manages to change textures based on traits and stuff, so that's already some ways into it XD
    The furry artists are already WAY ahead of you.
*Palpussy* ![img](emote|t5_4jn9v4|49345)
üòÇüòÇ
    This game worth.
Wait.. are you talking about pal with pal or..... You AND your pal? Hybrid pal update. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|dizzy_face)
    There‚Äôs a breeding farm already for pals. I think this dude just wants the game to show them actually doing the nasty
        Or he want to do nasty things..........
It‚Äôs true craftopia was in EA for a few years, but once seamless hit they immediately put out a roadmap like they just did with Palworld and mostly followed it to a T. A lot of that time was them learning how to build the bones of what Palworld would eventually be if you were to go and compare it to Craftopia‚Äôs seamless version right now.
At this point pal world exploded largely and Microsoft is investing into them I don't think they could give up without 1 possibly going bankrupt and 2 ruining any reputation they have right now possibly never being able to make anything again without hate the backlash would be insane
3 it's gonna be extremely profitable this is gonna expand their company alot so In all situations it's a big win as long as they keep it up
If they would increase player dmg then why would you still need pals? I think the dmg is fine as is.  The player should be a support of the pal in combat dmg wise. Not the other way around imo.
    It‚Äôs honestly a significant problem in the mid game. You‚Äôre pretty much just sitting there watching your pal do all the work because anything you can do is negligible. Add on to that there is very little you can do to direct pals in combat, and it becomes very un-engaging. If they want to keep the emphasis on pals doing the combat damage, adding in more ways for players to interact with their pals in combat would be ideal. Even just a block command that you could time to reduce damage would make it way more engaging.
        More importantly, seeing tour pal destroy the pal you wanted to catch. There should be some weaken option for your pals instead of kill or not kill, so they auto stop
            Kinda like false swipe right?
Live service games have skewed our perceptions of the game industry.

It wasn't that long ago that a small indie title getting *millions* of purchases in the first week would have been considered a smash hit amazing game, no one would expect it to keep those numbers a few weeks after launch.

Now everyone is trying to act like Palworld is a failure because it's concurrent player count has dropped.
Red and Blue are forever legendary
    Let‚Äôs not forget Yellow. The best of all 3 imo
It'll probably continue to have user bumps each time content gets released, and considering Pokemon has basically been riding that train for years with their game releases (albeit without actually giving a shit about the game/ content quality or what players want) I think its fair they could easily ride this out for a couple years, minimum. theres a lot of pokemon fans that want that type of content and havent been getting it from game freak.
    Each new Pok√©mon game is heavily advertised tho, they aren‚Äôt gonna heavily advertise each new content patch are they
Why this is downvoted? This is a fact tho. As for 2-3 weeks from now on. No one can be sure. And the content is still barebones
    Because people can't stand it when they get served straight facts when they love something.
    It‚Äôs the palworld sub bro it‚Äôs like going to a nursing home and calling everyone old fucks they gonna get mad
    because it ignores the part where most players have spent 100+ hours in this game
        I did say this game is worth the money, and i have 100 hours in it.
        Yes. The monster catching + base building mechanic does make the game addicted.
Temp being more the potential to retain a good player count and build a community (like Pokemon). Would be great if this game preserved that community/interest and built a franchise long term by adding new content/updates/innovation, like you said it‚Äôs not even version 1 yet. Apparently the devs don‚Äôt have a great track record so will be interesting to see where it goes.
ü§£ü§£ü§£
I'd rather have them improve already big map and add to it. There's plenty of empty space if they want to add land.
    I‚Äôm looking at you massive tree I can‚Äôt reach
        I was so sad when I hit the red wall üò¢

I had a good thirty seconds of denial. I was like "maybe I just need to come from a different angle"

Then I finally accepted the truth that I would not get to the tree
            You can go "over" the red wall but then there's another invisible barrier thats a bit closer to the tree
                Fun fact. Technically its not an other invisible barrier, its the collision of the tree.
The fect that pocket pair uses unreal engine 5.1 for palworld and the default collision for a imported model is a  "simple"  collision  what that does is it is looking at the form of the model and than make a collision barrier around the full model fromfrom top to bottom.
But it the gonna set the collision to " use  complex collision" it would look at the model and based on the polygons of the model its would be the same for the collision.
So its really just the model collision and not a invisible barrier 

But i think the devs didn't predict that the players still could find a way to go over it. 

Still a good place to make a farming base as i did  its mostly flat and no other pals or raids comming there
            I, too, tried to go around it. For a good minute I went along the red wall, hoping there would be a way in‚Ä¶
        I will never forget the sound in my friends voice when I told him he was not going to reach the tree, about 3 seconds before he hit the wall.
        Praise the Erdtree
        There is hint In the opening scene something will be done with that tree
    The bottom right corner of the map seems fit for a few new islands and a max level bump.
        There's been talk that the portion available to us is part of a big chain of islands surrounding the big tree in the distance. Could possibly up the level cap, and introduce new islands with new pals that way
            On that note the devs said they‚Äôre planning for 4 major releases, which would correspond to the 3 other corners and the island of the big tree itself
                Hope one of those updates includes a huge underground system
            They have already stated new Islands would be coming
            The big tree concept sounds super intriguing, like it could be a central hub connecting these islands, and maybe each island has its own unique ecosystem? That'd keep things fresh and give a reason to explore, more than just a level cap incentive. Plus, imagine if each new island came with its own set of challenges or environmental hazards to survive.
                That's what I'm hoping, something different environmentally as well as the pals that'll spawn

Considering what they put out to start with, I do have hope they could give us something exciting with new islands and such
                >That'd keep things fresh

So what you're saying is that right now we are in Kanto, soon there will be Johto and eventually Hoenn, Sinnoh, Unova and (checks notes...) _Paldea_.
        According to game code, level isn't hard capped until 80 but it's currently blocked at 50. So there is at least a plan to go to 80 at the moment.
            At 10 level increments. Primary release to 50. 3 expansion releases at 10 levels a piece.
                Would make sense too, I really don‚Äôt see the next update suddenly adding lvl 80 pals (and the next updates 100/140)
                In a year or 2 mabye
            I feel like they need to add more requirements for leveling after 50 too. Like to get to 60 you need xp and a certain amount of your paldex filled out or something just to make it a little harder to max out
        I'd rather that be changed into water focused zone, but everything else I agree with.  


I'd like to have to ride a pal with "surf" in order to get out there and then use a pal with "dive" in order to breach the water and explore and catch deep sea pals.
            I get what you‚Äôre saying but flying mounts kind of make that unnecessary. I still would like them to add that kind of stuff as an option. Underwater areas would be so cool. They could even add scuba gear.
                There are possible lore accurate ways to prevent flying in certain places to make use of other kinds of mechanics
                    I think that would be a bad move personally
                        Don't want caves or underwater bioms?
                            I do but I still want the option to fly over water. Maybe I misunderstood
                    Tbh they should just make your flying pal go back into its ball if they ‚Äúland‚Äù over water while mounted in order to make water pals more useful
                        Not from just landing on water, but maybe if they run out of stamina and fall onto water.
                Eh, the way the stamina system works with flying mounts, it's more efficient to just take a water mount that doesn't drain stam when in the water for long ocean trips, then switch once you make landfall, rather than starting out with a flyer and having to take frequent rest stops
                If there's a water mount that surfs faster than flying mounts then they would be viable
                Flying mounts do make you descend every once in a while which is kind of annoying and a different experience than a water mount, which I'd definitely like.
    JUST LET ME GO TO THE TREE!¬†
        You can "get" to the tree and go past the wall, but there's nothing there. It's currently set dressing.

But that tree is definitely important. All the skill fruits grow on trees seemingly made of paldium. All the dungeon final rooms have a larger tree that is similar to the skill fruit trees.

I have a feeling that big tree is the source of the paldium, the origin of the pals, and likely will be the finale of the planned updates.
            I think it even says as much in the journals or in some of the item flavor text. Something about the energy from the tree making palladium and it's carried through the water which is why all the small palladium rocks spawn by oceans/rivers
                Great, there goes who knows how many hours searching out the journals.
    YES. LET ME GO TO THE TREE.   
WE YEARN FOR THE TREE.
    I saw someone post an idea where they expand the map with the big tree as the center and the current map is only a quarter of the whole thing. This is now what I hope will happen.
    Based on one analysis somewhere in this sub Reddit, the current map takes up a potential 25% of the total area
    Big map???????????????

I‚Äôve already explored about 70-80% of the map‚Ä¶ the frozen zones are the only places I haven‚Äôt been‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm around lvl 25-30.

Hit 90 of 111 Pals‚Ä¶

Best pretty much all the Pal Bosses up to level 30‚Ä¶

Beat Zoe‚Ä¶ the only boss I‚Äôve fought so far‚Ä¶

Setup a mining operation with Anubis x5, Verdash x3, a water type and a Shadowbesk to haul materials to the chests‚Ä¶

And I‚Äôm bored with it‚Ä¶
I think that is for a few years time minimum tbh as currently alot of the map is filler.

Not hating ofc as I love the game, but when I first saw how big the map was I was mad impressed, but now I've explored it all I would say about 60% of the larger map is just filler to be there, with no real structures or locations to make it unique
    That‚Äôs what I noticed to, all these ‚Äústructures‚Äù, but they are just scenery.
        Being pre release they can easily work on density as well as expanding.

The map is beautiful,  just lacking in content and story in it.  Even just bumping the spawn rate to 3x makes the world feel so much more alive.
That'd be a LOT of work for such a small team, but I think they said they plan on adding new islands with some new pals
    not like wildcard was a huge team when they started making ark, were they? palworld has practically unlimited budget right now, i think they could afford to expand the team a little and hire some more artists/map designers if that's truly what they wanted to do. I think most people would prefer them to just add on to the current map though, maybe have a loading screen to a new "region" or something after taking a boat where it's essentially a new map, assuming they can't just keep expanding the existing single map because of performance reasons.
        There was a rumor that the giant tree would become the true center of a bigger map and your be able to select which region around the tree you'd wanna spawn
            this would be very cool
        sadly wildcard bit more than they could chew and it blew up in their faces
            wildcard made truly awful decisions one after another even after getting bailed out numerous times. im expecting ark 2 to be some kind of singleplayer only game, or at least heavily narrative based. it just seems so odd to me they're spending all this time making ARK: SA when ARK 2 is supposedly coming out this year. they're gonna have two competing games in the same franchise confusing new players. why they wouldn't just keep making ARK 2 until it's done I don't know, maybe they desperately needed a cash infusion or maybe I'm right and it's not gonna be a pvp survivalcraft at all.
                Because a huge percentage of the ark player base has absolutely zero interest in a third person only arksouls conan evolved game. People just wanted ark to work properly and be playable. Unfortunately ASA is the same turd as ASE except this turd has been rolled in glitter.
                    i mean, tons of people play ark in third person. i'm not making any definitive assumptions on gameplay until we see gameplay footage or their marketing ramps up.
                Well, ARK 2 is going to be nothing like ARK: SA, ARK 2 is a souls like narrative driven game and will be almost an entirely different game from ARK: SA, the only thing that will link ARK 2 to the original ARKs will be the lore and dinosaurs

The reason they made ARK: SA was to please fans of ARK: SE Since most of us didn‚Äôt want a souls like version of ARK, we wanted regular ARK
                    Are you sure about that? I don't think they ever said anywhere ARK 2 *wouldn't* be survival craft, but they said it would have more soulsy on-foot combat, which doesn't mean a survival craft is dead. But idk.
                        Well im sure its gonna still have survival crafting, but last I checked they were focusing on 3rd person souls like exploration/combat which is absolutely different than what we have in ARK:SE/A Which is unique
    They have enough money to hire at least 10/20 devs/designers lol
        Also, Microsoft will be bankrolling them. They want this to become their Mario/Poke/GOW
            Indoubtedly
        100 / 200
        They already have 14 programmers and 5 game designers, for reference.
There‚Äôs plenty of room on the map to add to and infinite possibilities for new pals, I don‚Äôt see why they wouldn‚Äôt after they get farther through their road map
I know this isn't a commonly held opinion, but I'd love procedurally generated worlds as an option. Don't ditch the handmade map, but it would be interesting to play different games that have new randomized worlds and randomized pal spawn areas.
That‚Äôs on their roadmap actually!
I really hope they expand with more maps or areas. Other than just reworking dungeons every now and again.
From what The devs somewhat implied, now take it with a grain of salt, is that they're going to add other islands. Now, I saw a YouTuber make a theory that the islands are going to kind of circle around the giant tree in the middle of the map. It would make a perfect full circle, make an absolutely gargantuan map, and give them plenty of new space to add plenty of new biomes, story areas, new pals, new features and functions to fit these new areas, and so much more. And maybe eventually they will add the central tree area to be a playable area. That would be awesome to build a base and its branches way up high
Very much the same. I'm routinely sitting playing other games and think "shit. I want to play Palworld."
    Yeah my backlog went even further because I‚Äôve been playing this like crazy
True
And a dash of Elden Ring
Hi! Gigantic Pokemon fan here. Palworld improves on the Pokemon formula in every way except IV breeding. I love this game, excited to see what it looks like with more development.

For more context, I love Conan exiles, elden ring, and factorio, but never really liked ARK at all.

Edit: Some of you think I used 'IV' as a replacement for 'for'. lol. I realize not everyone is familiar with breeding in pokemon. IV stands for [Individual Value](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Individual_values) and is a mostly hidden stat boost to a monsters base stats.
    I think the biggest appeal to palworld for Pokemon fans (including myself) is that palworld plays like the Pokemon games have always described the world, even though we never really experienced it in those games.

The Pokemon games always talked about how people lived and worked alongside Pokemon, but we only got to battle. The games talked about how dangerous Pokemon were without your own to defend yourself from them, but you always had one. The games talked about how evil and exploitative criminal organizations were without in any way describing how they could be. (to be fair on this point, palworld doesn't really show the syndicates engage in exploitation either, but the actions available to the player do a good job of filling in the blanks, should you go that route) There's a lot of dark themes hinted at in Pokemon games as well, but it's always got that Disney candy-coating on top that keeps it from ever actually feeling significant.

In a lot of ways, Palworld simply delivers on the *promise* Pokemon games have been giving us for years without following through.
        Totally agree. Pokemon games only ever touch on the dark side through pokedex entries or text. You almost never really see the brutal side of a pokemon world.
            This is why I loved Legends Arceus so much, it started dipping its toes into the darker side, like the casual mention of Pokemon wanting to murder you. But then they threw that away with scarlet and violet, and Legends only just barely dipped its toes in. Palworld just dove head first into the darkness
                Doesn‚Äôt Palworld‚Äôs reminds you quite a bit of arceus? It definitely made me go hmmmmm
                    Literally the only relation it has is that it's cute creatures caught in balls and it's open world. Totally different concept otherwise if you ask me. The similarities are numerous but it's really not as similar as alot of people say. (I'll admit I've accidentally called some pals by the Pokemon they look similar to
        Such a good way of putting it
    How do you feel about the pal vs pal combat out of curiosity? Despite how much I love this game I think the AI is one of the game‚Äôs biggest weaknesses and I actually do not feel this was an improvement. 

Not saying they can‚Äôt potentially fix and improve the combat AI, but it‚Äôs a little frustrating seeing my Anubis stumped by object permanence when he runs into a pillar during a tower fight. I‚Äôm also not holding my breath on the combat AI being fixed because I think that‚Äôs one of the more difficult challenges to tackle and they haven‚Äôt mentioned it being a priority to my knowledge.
        Honestly its pretty fucking boring without greater control over your pals who cant be mounted. I'm not really excited for pvp until combat is improved from a competetive standpoint.

In terms of fulfilling a monster-tamer fantasy? It meets the mark, and has a leg up on pokemon as you can use many many more monsters as mounts, and even mounted combat
        I think simply adding a 4th move and the option to select which move they use via the radial wheel where you pet and choose aggro would do wonders for this. I'd be kind of surprised if they're not working in the ai, though considering that's a huge complaint of the community and pocket pair seems to listen well.
            I personally wouldn‚Äôt even necessarily be frustrated with them if they couldn‚Äôt fix it. It would go a long way toward making the game a better experience but npc AI seems to be something even AAA studios struggle with sometimes. 

I don‚Äôt know what all they‚Äôre working with, but if they keep putting out content and fixing what they can I‚Äôll be coming back. That just happens to be the biggest item on my wishlist.
        >How do you feel about the pal vs pal combat out of curiosity?

honestly its pretty bad right now, The bigger pals are janky as fuck, and their moves are even more janky. The AI is also pretty bad. Hopefully it gets fixed in the future
    Im ngl ark did the ‚Äò‚Äôark‚Äô‚Äô style survival so bad its not even funny

Conan is a slight bit better but still overall suffers from the same issues ark does but palworld however took that style further and improved on it hard
        All I ever did in conan was tame animals and use them for all my combat anyway haha
    Gigantic pokemon fan here too. I love palworld but I think it's dumb to compare the two. For a start pokemon is conditional turn based which opens the door whereas palworld has no strategy, just shoot
        When my level 25 tanzie is fighting a mammoth, there is definitely strategy. Lol
        Pokemon hasn't evolved that formula in 20 years. All it took was a team to make the pokemon game people wanted from Nintendo for years and it sold like wildfire.
            I love Pal world. They did a lot of great things.

What they did not do is deliver a strategy game; and pokemon very much is. Lots of mind games with the team you bring to a rank match, because you don‚Äôt use all of them; the switches you make mid battle to try to gain a type advantage; the move selection you choose and the type coverage it offers.

And I will **always** prefer evolutions on my creature collectors. I don‚Äôt really like having 2 pals that are clearly related. I don‚Äôt care about world building, I care about how I used my pengullet for 20 levels: I don‚Äôt want to capture a new penking, I want my pengullet to evolve

Palworld **changed** and then improved on Pok√©mon. I still want the open world ‚Äúpokemon‚Äù game too. I‚Äôm greedy sure; but I know Nintendo is too

Edit: ‚Äútiming‚Äù does not equal ‚Äústrategy‚Äù. palworld has zero strategy involved. It‚Äôs an action game where we can use actions to time switches to gain a benefit. But there is no ‚Äúshould I try to dodge, or should I face tank it‚Äù. You should try to dodge.

Double edit: I forgot this sub is full of children who have to go ‚ÄúAcTuAlY‚Äù to every little thing. Thank you for giving me the push to leave the sub
                If you try facing enemy's 5 levels above you, strategy, assigned attacks and subbing out are very much a thing as your guns do literally 9-11 damage per hit. I'm not to fussed on evolutions myself, as most are unique enough to not seem related in the way you draw lines between pokemon lineage.
                    Pulling Pals defensively to avoid attacks is also something to be mindful of during a fight.
                    I would claim that ‚ÄúSubbing‚Äù in this game is not a ‚Äústrategy‚Äù. All you think is ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to get hit better recall my pal‚Äù. It‚Äôs a test of your timing skill, not your critical thinking skill

While Subbing in pokemon is deciding to give your opponent an immediate benefit, so that you can gain a future benefit; that is strategy
                        Eh, it's still boiling back to live vs turn based, in a live pokemon battle you also wouldn't have time to map a strategy like you do in turnbased, it's tennis vs chess.

Edit: not sure why you blocked me after last reply but OK lol
                            
Then open world pokemon game will still be turn based, just like Arcues/Scarlet/violet‚Ä¶what‚Äôs your point?

Edit: I blocked them for continuing to change what I am trying to talk about and ignoring what I was saying‚Ä¶.this wasn‚Äôt a discussion it was the other user talking at me.

Edit for the person below; I hope you get the help you need friend ‚ù§Ô∏è
                Turn based combat is a very heavy mechanic in pokemon, but I dont really see it as a defining feature at all and is incredibly boring and dated imho
                    bro turn based combat is like, a hallmark of many s-tier rpg's lol. that's like saying fps is boring and dated because its a heavy mechanic in doom/wolfenstein. (for the record i'm not dissing you for disliking turn based combat, i see what you're getting at)
                        I don't think they were saying that turn-based combat ***in general*** is boring and dated, but rather that ***Pokemon's*** turn-based combat is boring and dated... which is accurate, IMO. They really haven't changed it all that much from the original Pokemon games.
                            Mmm fair point lol. Pokemon‚Äôs rigid formula is incredibly stale and I haven‚Äôt fully played through one since sword/shield, which i found exceedingly disappointing
                            Because it's a solid system and doesn't have to change. If you e played competitive pokemon you'll see that pokemons turn based gameplay is actually very intense, turn by turn reads and plays are wild. If you're into chess and card games, competitive pokemon would be right up your alley. 

What the games need are better stories, better AI, and higher difficulty. And even then, the latest DLC actually gave us an entire zone where every battle was a double battle with the NPCs using real items and strats, they're getting there finally.
                    Turn based combat as a whole will never be ‚Äúdated‚Äù what are you smoking? 

People care about their joints; we can‚Äôt just play button smashing action games all the time. That‚Äôs how you get carpal tunnel
                        I don't mind turn based combat in abstract 2d games but with the modern 3d style of new pokemon games it's pathetic
                            Why?

Edit: *is it ‚Äúpathetic‚Äù*
                    Lol there is a global level tournament for pokemon battling, it is the basis of how the card game works, it's what the anime is based on, it is the core gameplay system of the series for almost 30 years...


How is that NOT a defining feature? You can think it's boring and you're welcome to your opinion but it's a silly stance to take as truth. Is chess boring? Hasn't changed its gameplay in actual centuries yet it's still the most recognized boardgame/strategy game in the world? Is LoL boring for not having changed its gameplay in the 15 years since its release?

YOU might not care for it and that's a fine opinion to have, same as I don't care for shooters. But let's not live in our own mental canon where mainline pokemon games ARENT DEFINED by their turn based strategy elements. That's like saying main Mario games arent defined by their platforming elements. It's a silly take.

It's not boring, it's not dated. It's actually very intense, takes a lot of practice and game knowledge to be good at and has a rich strategic elements. Again you don't have to love it but calling it boring and dated is like calling chess boring and dated.
            "The game people wanted", no, think what you might like, most fans *don't* want something edgy or over the top like Palworld.
                You can deny it as long as you want, but the majority of people who bought it love pokemon and are keen to see the more adult pokemon world, meanwhile pokemon still tries to sanitise the whole enslaving creatures to cockfight aspect.
                    Or majority bought it for the memes and don't engage in the vocal group that say "THIS IS WHAT POKEMON SHOULD BE LIKE"
                        Like I said feel, free to deny it as long as you want
        PalWorld isn‚Äôt like the Pok√©mon GAMES. PalWorld is like how the world of Pok√©mon is actually described by GameFreak and even the anime.
        "Just shoot" is the same take as "Just press A" in turn-based games. 

Palworld has more skill expression than Pokemon, it just doesn't matter with the current game state because there's no reason to do it.
            More things in common with Pokemon in a way lol. There's lots of knowledge and skill expression in Pokemon that very few ever even touch because the base game doesn't challenge you enough.
        Gigantic Pok√©mon fan here. Pok√©mon was never good because of the battle system. But for the team building and fun world. Palworld just improves that by alot
            Gigantic Pokemon fan here. Team building only matters because of the battle system. The fun world is only an additional part. You remove the battle system, and it stops feeling like Pokemon and just feels like chaos.

Palworld is entirely different because of this. There‚Äôs no strategy. You can actually return your Pals as a move is hitting them to prevent damage and then send them back out. Typings don‚Äôt matter cause any Pal can learn any type move and STAB is negligible compared to other passives.
                Eh. I've played multiple Pok√©mon games where I shot through with the same team for pretty much the entire game, ignoring the battle system.
                    This is my beef with a lot of the newer Pokemon games tbh. Ever since they turned the exp share on permanently, you don‚Äôt really even have to try anymore for the most part. 

There are some good mods and stuff out there though where strategy is definitely still very important. And that does make for a much more engaging experience imo. 

I do love both Pokemon and Palworld but I agree that they give different vibes - at least when Pokemon is done right or is at a competitive level.
                        You never really needed to use more than one pokemon. You could just overlevel one pokemon and then keep the rest as revive sacrifices.
                its better than pokemon just deal with it they did what hey should have done palsworld should partner with digimon for their first cosmetic drop
                That's the thing. Team building in palworld doesn't just revolve around the battling. You have to consider traversal, resource gathering and the environment and time of day. Not to mention the whole base team. If the battle system was the most important thing in Pok√©mon how come the anime, the card game, pokken, mystery dungeon, snap etc still feels like Pok√©mon

There is a lot of strategy. Tho the strategy is different. You have to think more on your feet. There isn't a pause to give you time to plan. Typings matter arguably more than in Pok√©mon because of the simplified type chart..
                    There really isn't a lot of strategy. Game is piss easy, which isn't a bad thing, but you can go guns blazing and succeed more often than not lol



Half the stuff you listed is a bit of a reach. Traversal options don't require strategy. It boils down to use flier or use ground mount. Thats it. 


Hell, you can completely ignore type advantages and still win. It won't even be difficult.
                >Palworld is entirely different because of this. There‚Äôs no strategy.

Pokemons strategy is exclusively type countering, pokemon also has potions which completely negate using any strategy. Which is fine because the game is designed that way.

Theres a reason why every pokemon game, if you exclusively use your starter you will go through every bad type match up gym completely out leveling them. Not to mention types don't even matter when you can learn adjacent type abilities.
                    This was basically my strat as a kid. Went through every generation up to platinum just using my starter to burst through everything. 

Strategy: grass type? Charizard. Flying type? Charizard water type? Charizard

Except Fire Red, where I was possessed by the rat spirit and went through the game with 2 Rattata that never evolved.
                So do you like Palworld still or not really. Genuine question.
                Well by that logic Pokemon has no strategy either. You can steamroll through with just one move ignoring type altogether as long as you level a single mon enough. And that's exactly how I played it when I was a kid
                I agree! By now I've played Palworld to level 45 with a bunch of friends, beating every single tower boss but Victor/Shadowbeak and capturing every single Alpha pal available. The combat system is fine for as long as shooting up bullets and rockets into pocket monsters seem funny to you. Gets boring really fast, specially if you're hoping to find any tactical approach. It all boils down to variance and design space.

It could be easily remedied by increasing the relevancy of Pal/move types and Unique Abilities. Something easily done and worked on given enough time to playtest and refine. 

For reference: 
ON POK√âMON Type advantage may go up to 4x or 400% move damage. 
Disadvantage may go down to 0.25x or 25% or even 0 (Type immunity)
STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) adds 50% of a move's power to its total power before calculation if it has the same typing as the user.

ON PALWORLD type advantage may go up to 1.4x or 140% move damage. That's 260% less upwards variance than pok√©mon.
Disadvantage goes down to 0.6x or 60% move damage. That's 45% less downwards variance than pok√©mon, 60% less if you consider the lack of immunity in Palworld. (although these numbers might not be precise, they might actually err to less)
STAB on Palworld also adds only 20% to a move's power before damage calc. (confirmed value) That's 30% less impactful than pok√©mon.

The result is a dumbed down version of the pok√©mon battle system requiring little care for choice and variance. Since its conception, pok√©mon gym leaders employ monotype team compositions SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED to give the player an edge by growing a cast with flexible offensive options, instead of grinding your head into a wall.

On Palworld, you can hop on a Ragnahawk or Pyrin with 4 Gobfin on bench and breeze your way through the ENTIRE game. Alternatively, dark-type Nocturnal Pyrin, Frostallion Noct, Helzephyr, Maraith or Nox (These all do the exact same thing. Really, search it up.) and the same Gobfin setup would work. You can easily optimize Palworld by having monotype teams, or teams entirely dedicated to boosting player attack and defense. Which is fine and dandy if it were only an option, and not the playstyle you're forced to take.


Some pok√©mon are allowed to have busted 600 total stats by possessing typing that's disadvantageous to common attacks in the game, such as Mega Scizor, Genesect, Kommo-o, Tyranitar. Alternatively even weak 500 stats are made battle viable through a combination of synergistic typing+ability, such as Eelektross, Spiritomb and Shedinja, having either no weaknesses or being immune to most offensive moves.

On Palworld, none of this would even matter, since damage variance on typing is negligible and there is no immunity for some reason. It's simply damage % stacking upon damage. You can just mash numbers against a wall and it will break, and that's the most if not only viable strategy. This implies a greatly limited design space and variety. New additions to the game will only have bigger and bigger stats with higher damage moves, since that's the only way to make Pals relevant. The current system is made to be powercrept when it could be so much more.

It doesn't help that there is a grand variety of 137 Pals counting environmental variants, with 75% of the "unique" Abilities providing one thing and one thing only: % damage boost. no immunity to anything (such as Lightning Rod or Flash Fire). no speed boost. no speeding up cast time. no conditions to acquire higher stats (such as Guts or Moxie). no applying negative effects (such as Intimidate). no weather effects (such as Sandstream, Drought, Drizzle, etc you get the gist.) Just pure unconditional damage increase. Basically all battle-oriented pals have fucking Huge Power and you can mount on them sometimes. Even then, the most exquisite mount abilities such as active rocket launchers and firethrowers actually just suck, they're extremely underwhelming: completely defeating the purpose of the game's "rule of cool". Seriously think about how cool would be a Pal with weather altering abilities, bringing upon a rain or thunderstorm when it's summoned. Instead we have "Generic Partner Skill Name #78: Boost type damage". or "Generic Partner Skill Name #110: Apply type damage".
                    You competely ignore the fact that in virtually every Pok√©mon game, you can literally get through the entire game if you just use your starter the entire time. Many people point out this is what they did as a kid, myself included. Pok√©mon games require no tactical approach unless you actively introduce it yourself (something I unconsciously started doing myself on later runs/games by purposely swapping out my starter).
                    TL;DR: Palworld is very simplified and basic in combat design (active/passive/unique skills & typings) meaning there‚Äôs very little strategy, even in team building.

You got me with the ‚ÄúBasically all battle-oriented mons have fucking huge power.‚Äù I never saw it like that until you pointed it out.

I also realized that, because any Pal can learn any move, any meta will always boil down to having multiple of the same Pal on your team. Let‚Äôs say you don‚Äôt care about unique skills, Pal A has the highest base attack stat in the game. You would want to use Pal A in multiple forms because STAB doesn‚Äôt matter and move pools don‚Äôt matter. Why would you use Pal B with a lower base attack stat when Pal A does literally the same thing (again, ignoring Unique Skills)? I don‚Äôt think the unique skills are good enough for you to pass up Pal A for Pal B.
                    A very in depth explanation of why this game is too easy.
        How exactly do you look at the Pal spheres, and the "collect em all" gameplay and NOT think Pokemon?
            I think they are saying that the *gameplay* of the two games aren't easy to compare. The aesthetics are a ripe comparison, yes.
        What if palworld added optional turn-based mode. Would that be possible and has any game done that?
    Dude I hated ark there was high level dinosaurs in the starting area that I got spawn killed by every time I tried to get my loot bag
        Yup, sounds like Ark. I love Ark, but I doubt I'd love it if I didn't love dinosaurs. Shit is a nightmare very often. 


And that's before the inevitable bugs.
    Lets wait on judging IVs until we see competitive.  If competitive works around IVs then IVs are not a problem because they would only be an optional carrot you dont need to have.  If people are stressing about IVs without competitive just for the PVE.....that's not a game problem that's a them problem.    


Ain't no content in the game hard enough to require min/maxed IVs.  Also playing around IVs if you wish to is not 100 or 0.  You can easily just say "anything top 20% of IVs is good enough.
    > in every way except IV breeding

I understand why some people like this part of pokemon and other games, but honestly I wish games like this would step *away* from the eugenics grind. It's such a monotonous grind and it feels really bad to me to have a creature/partner that I've been training/raising since the start of the game become obsolete because its great*9 grandchild rolled better stats and passives. Makes it pointless to become attached to anything or care about investing resources in anything until you have whatever broken legend/x/x/x combo
        Hard agree, the IVs part of the stat system should have been left at the soul infusions and not another hidden stat tacked on under the hood. Thank fuck there arent EVs, although I guess condensing and souls are tantamount
    It's missing the rpg element by quite a bit though. At the moment it's just a big sandbox survival.
    Ark had an amazing concept but the devs fucked it up and the game had a lot of inconsistency‚Äôs that weren‚Äôt fixed until too late
    There are IVs in palworld
        Yes, and they're saying Palworld didn't improve on it.
    Really? Palworld improves on pokemon turn based monster battle? Cause I haven‚Äôt seen anything like that in palworld
        I would hardly say turn based combat is a unique experience for pokemon, not at all what I think of when I say 'the pokemon formula'
    Not at all, I don‚Äôt see any evolutionary or shiny pals nowhere, I don‚Äôt see a good story anywhere here, the games are separate experiences and should be treated as such
        I think the vast majority would disagree just because they dont evolve or come in a slightly different shade of purple... the overlap in core game mechanics is quite enough to justify a comparison
    The way you used ‚ÄúIV‚Äù bothers me despite it being cunning. Take a upvote

Edit: I forgot to say leave my presence.
        What about it bothers you? I didnt use it as a replacment for 'for'. It stands for Initial Value, which is a hidden boost to base stats and a breeding mechanic that exists in both pokemon and palworld. Historically it has been a pain in the ass to find out what these values are for newly hatched pokemon, but recently they have made it incredibly accessible. If palworld wants to keep the system, I think its best to make them visible to players without the use of calculators or mods
            Double entendres

            This is the first time I‚Äôm seeing my comment not show because of an edited post. That‚Äôs actually weird lol.
    Something about your use of the Roman numerals there ticked me off... and i hate you... but since i don't wanna seem like a bad guy I'm gonna express that using an anime girl meme so i come off as a fellow degenerate

        There are no roman numerals in their comment. There's Individual Value (IV) breeding.
        IV breeding? That's just the font. He's talking about breeding IVs, what Roman numerals are you talking about?
            IV =4 used for "for" in this context. I don't understand what you mean by font...
                IV is Roman numeral 4, yes, but he's talking about "Individual Values" or IVs.
                    ...

I would have literally never figured that out without help... and yet... i STILL don't know what that means. The individual value thing...

                        Pokemon define their stats by base stats + IVs. IVs are stats that are added to the pokemon each level depending on what kind of pokemon you have battled and gained exp from. Some pokemon will give you attack, some defence and some speed etc.. When you breed two pokemon the offspring will have bonuses depending on the parents' IV, I don't know exactly how that works mechanically but that's what "IV Breeding" means
                            Damn. I never knew this a thing. Thanks for teaching me about it. ![img](emote|t5_4jn9v4|49342)
                        Individual Values means that every Pokemon and Pal has a range of stats it can have.  
  
Not every Grizzbolt will have the same HP, Atk, and Def even if they have the same passives.
This is what every pokemon fan has wanted our whole fucking lives dude
    As a pokemon fan I can confirm, palworld is what legends arceus should have been, sure it has glitches, sure the pal base AI is a bit doo doo asscheeks, but it's in early access. The graphics are many leagues above too, sure it was on a switch and this one on PC but look at the zelda open worlds, they look just a bit worse. So in conclusion if P: LA is Daniel, then Palworld is the cooler Daniel
        Damnnn, Daniel
    I really hope it motivates Gamefreak to innovate.  They have the biggest IP in the entire world and haven't had a single innovation in nearly 30 years.  Seriously, what's really changed with Pokemon now vs 30 years ago? Color? 3D? Different types of evolution?
        Part of the problem is Pokemon is owned by 3 companies, Gamefreak, Nintendo, and the Pokemon Company. I doubt all three heads of Cerberus can agree on a new direction when theyve grown so fat on what they do.
            Nintendo wants the game squeaky clean because they have always put themselves first and foremost as a family company. 

Gamefreak wants consistency and money, so no innovation.

And PC barely knows how to code a game to begin with.
                > Nintendo wants the game squeaky clean because they have always put themselves first and foremost as a family company. 

Well, most of the time anyway. For Bayonetta 2 the Link costume originally [had no cleavage at all](https://www.siliconera.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/cho_009.jpg), because Platinum Games was worried about exactly that squeaky clean attitude. However, when they took the designs of the Link, Peach, and Samus costumes to Nintendo for approval Nintendo [asked them to add cleavage to the Link outfit](https://www.siliconera.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/20141024_014750.png).
        Game freak rakes in massive profits and continues to sell more games than anyone churning out the same crap. They have no incentive to invest in something like this, their current formula prints money.
    Eh, I loved palworlds and it was amazing, but it‚Äôs certainly not what I wanted my whole life as a Pokemon fan. I think the more hardcore fans that are in to competitive and nuzlocking and the sort don‚Äôt really care for combat, stats, or really anything besides the collection portion of the game. The survival, building, and collection aspects are what I loved about it, the Pokemon aspects not so much, very different games and reasons for enjoyment
        You realize that there are ton of pokemon fans, competitive types are a minority of the actual players.
            ‚ÄúThis is what every Pokemon fan has ever wanted‚Äù and I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true, even not on an exaggerated level. I think there are a lot of fans of the game that aren‚Äôt just in it for collecting the Dex. Was just giving the more hardcore community a shout because they DEFINITELY wouldn‚Äôt compare it, and there‚Äôs thousands upon thousands of those people, so it‚Äôs really not that small of a group. Have quite a few friends that just play the mainline games once or twice and don‚Äôt get too into it and even they agree it‚Äôs really not all that similar.
                That last group you mentioned is most likely the biggest part of the Pok√©mon audience. Those that play the games a bit maybe finish the main story.
                    Yeah completely agree. It‚Äôs a smaller percent of people sure, but we generally play the games dozens of times through in different ways or have much much longer playthroughs. It‚Äôs also a much higher percent of people playing it year long instead of when the game releases or every few years when they have the urge to
                        Which is why palworld is exciting because it's an evolving world. It's not locked in place. I can come back in 6 months and the game could have changed alot. If I come back to scarlet and violet i get to pay $30 bucks for a couple hours of new stuff. And then wait a year for the next $60 game drop
                            Yeah, I‚Äôm super excited for the future, 60 hours for a 30 dollar game is already worth it to me, I‚Äôm sure in the future, especially with modding, this will be a multi 100 hour game
                Yeah Palworld doesn't give me the same feeling at all. I'm not a competitive player by any means but sometimes come back to play some of the more challenging firered rom hacks. 

The main problem with the Pokemon main series for me is the difficulty. You only really scratch the surface of the combat mechanics because the game is so easy. 

Another one is content. They had some neat mechanics like the Pokemon contests. Wish they would extend on stuff like that.
        So the majority of longtime Pmon fans myself included agree with the previous statement lol, you don't speak for us in any way, shape, or form. And the competitive circuit is It's own community, most people don't want lumped in with the min-max crowd bc they suck all the fun out of literally everything lol
            It‚Äôs not just competitive min maxers, it‚Äôs nuzlockers, challenge runners, shiny hunters and several other categories. I never claimed it wasn‚Äôt majority, I just think saying it‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs or even almost everyone‚Äôs is just wrong, probably 70% or so would agree, but a lot of people see very little similarities between the two besides ‚Äúcollective monster in ball‚Äù. There really isn‚Äôt much strategy involved with the game and that‚Äôs a huge part of Pokemon for A LOT of people. Disregarding huge portion of the community (even if not the majority, there‚Äôs still A LOT of people that are in one of these groups)
                They're not meant to be compared directly lol, see this is why people say yall suck the fun out of everything. There's plenty of strategy in it's own right. Choosing the right pals/techniques for an encounter makes it much easier, is that not strategy to you? Just bc you can do more in the moment than stand around giving commands doesn't mean it's not strategic. And nuzlockers would live it. I'm doing a no catch run rn where I'm going through the journey without crafting or using a single sphere. Shiny hunters would enjoy the hunts for lucky and Alt types, and I'd love to hear about these other categories bc it sounds like you're just moving goalposts for the sake of not being wrong.
                    ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not meant to be compared directly‚Äù

Ok so I‚Äôm right and it‚Äôs not what we‚Äôve been waiting for this whole time lol, if they aren‚Äôt comparable than it‚Äôs not what we waited for it
                        No you're just deluded and think you speak for the community as a whole, which your ass backwards opinions contradict. I don't know a single pokemon fan that isn't absolutely insufferable as a human being that doesn't think this game is cool. You can be triggered all you want but yes the majority of Pmon fans think palworld is awesome lol.
                            I‚Äôve literally said multiple times I don‚Äôt speak for the majority? Just a large group of people lol, just stop, I‚Äôm not responding anymore to this needless agression
    lol. lmao even
    Is it? I thought Pok√©mon fans wanted an actual JRPG instead of a mediocre survival game with a Pok√©mon gimmick slapped on top of it. I just don't see how this game has anything to do with Pok√©mon once the honeymoon period of monster collection fades away.
    You guys wanted a survival craft game? My brother, you did not have to wait all these years.
My wife grew up on Pok√©mon. Still has her card collection but has lost interest in the last 10 years. They just keep rehashing the same game formula with occasional, uninteresting spinoffs that dont provide much replay value. The closest thing they made to a Pok√©mon game for adults was the Ryan Reynolds movie.

We have about 70 hours combined in palworld (mostly her), and she says this is the kind of game pokemon should have made.
    everyone who likes Pokemon has been saying the same thing and its damn true
        Not me.
            I think Pokemon Violet was a lot like Palworld. Because  once I got to the part you are supposed to walk up the hill to school, I just explored the entire map climbing mountains and catching Pals instead.
    Pokemon is never gonna rehash itself to be an entirely different genre. It would be silly. Palworld is ARK with pokemon and that's it, expecting pokemon to drop its entire battle system and genre(which is a global esport with monetary prizes btw) to chase a new genre is absurd and would alienate its audience.

No one who actually grew up with pokemon wants palworld as the future. Even romhack makers don't make stuff like palworld, they create rpgs with pokemon. That's what they always have been. I'm glad you Teo enjoy palworld, but to say pokemon should've made a game like palworld is so disconnected from what pokemon actually is.

I've seen this sentiment lot of people wishing pokemon would be like palworld and the reality is no it shouldn't be.  Pokemon is nearly 30 years, growing every year, catching new generations of fans and keeping plenty of old ones doing what they do. Can there be a survival game spinoff? Sure but that's not pokemon, that's a survival game with pokemon and frankly I think the idea of automation via pokemon slaves would be pretty shitty world building wise.

Is it formulaic? Yes. But that's why pokemon works. I'd rather pokemon keeps IMPROVING at what they do, and not lose their identity. No other major player does what pokemon does in gaming. And yea the games need better performance and more story, they absolutely have room to grow, WITHIN their field.

Anyone saying Palworld is the kind of game pokemon should have made is detached from what pokemon really is and has their own mental canon of what it could be. We don't need "pokemon for adults". Pokemon is for everyone. In the same way that disney movies are for everyone.
        Theres people who played pokemon r/b/y/g/s and stopped. Being a pokemon fan doesnt mean youve purchased/played every game in the franchise. This game works well for people who only played gen 1/2 pokemon and happen to like survival games too. Ask someone if they enjoyed valheim, ask if they played pokemon red/blue. If the answer is yes to both theyll enjoy palworld.
            What part of RGBY would match palworld? If anything people who played the more modern games that actually are open world (legends arceus and SV) are more likely to enjoy palworld if only because the open world design similarity. A thin connection but a bigger one than saying "oh you played pokemon 25 years ago? You'll love this survival game where you collect monsters." There have been plenty of monster collector games since, it takes more than catching monsters to be a good game.

It's disingenuous to conflate pokemon gameplay to palworld and i really don't think there's any connection. Hell my palworld friend actively does not like pokemon and never has and he loves palworld, because they're not the same.
                You‚Äôve got such a rage boner that you‚Äôre conflating everything i‚Äôve said. I‚Äôm done talking at you, if you want discourse i‚Äôll come back later when you‚Äôve had your juice box and chill out.
Agreed. I miss evolving the Pals. I have never played enough Ark to immediately like the building and producing parts. Had to really spend hours in the beginning since I had 0 experience, so picking a place for my 1st base was done at random.

But the Pals walking outside, the world being not so empty as the latest games from Pok√©mon, that's all a dream from a Pok√©mon player (who played mainly during HG/SS). Collecting Pals, having shinies (unfortunately not entirely like I would have wanted), breeding, eggs - that's the things that make for a fit as well.
    Pokemon could easily take inspiration from other games to make different genres too. Like a pokemon cozy farming game would be amazing. Like rune factory or even what palworld does on a surface level.

I enjoyed the turn base RPG of Arceus - it was fast paced and kept me engaged. But it was basically it's only mechanic so the game got old for me much faster than palworld. I'm about 100 hours in on Palworld and I only did about 20 hours on Arceus.

One game was $60 and the other was $30. I think Gamefreak has an unreasonable release schedule, but as long as 20 million people buy their games full price every year they have no reason to change anything.

Even with palworld being a success they again have no reason to change anything because fans will still buy their games.

Until sales take a downward turn they aren't going to budge.
    Evolving pals just lowers the amount of useful pals in the game, same as pokemon.¬†
I'm a purely Pok√©mon fan and I've really been enjoying every aspect of Palworld. Gives you a lot more freedom for what you can do with your critters compared to Pok√©mon and I really like that.
It also seems like they are developing an rog aspect. imagine if they added towns larger towns in non start areas and trainers that you can fight. theres already one guy who has in inferam as his pal chillin on a hilltop
*Pulls out butchering cleaver*

It‚Äôs a tad different 

*(Pixels and slicing sounds)*
Them custom sliders can make it manageable.
Have a friend that hated ark, loves Pok√©mon. Loves pals. I think it‚Äôs a very good fit for purely Pok√©mon fans. It‚Äôs something different after years of similar game after game
>I am not sure if it is a good fit for purely Pokemon fans. It is a very different game after all

yeah, its the game fans have been praying for, perfect for pokemon fans
I keep trying to tell people they‚Äôre completely different games. If someone told me they loved every single detail about Palworld and wanted something similar there are about a dozen games I‚Äôd recommend before Pok√©mon unless they told me their favorite element of the game was the Pal Deck. And even then, it wouldn‚Äôt be the top recommendation.

I‚Äôd say the same thing if the story were flipped and someone wanted pokemon-likes. They are just not similar games at all.
    To me, I explain to pokemon players that Palworld is what I had hoped Pokemon Arceus would be like
    I love riding with Zoe & Grizzbolt! ü§™
    They are very different games. They are very similar brands/IPs. The majority of people who play Pok√©mon play it because if the IP and aren‚Äôt particularly attached to the gameplay. If a Pok√©mon fan is dissatisfied with the quality or diversity of gameplay, which is a *lot*, this is an excellent choice.
    they are different, but as someone who primarily plays Pok√©mon, it was enough to make me want to play this game. I also really liked cassette beasts. I think it‚Äôs got potential be a genre that really only Pok√©mon occupied before.
    Out of curiosity what games would you recommend?
        Conan exiles and Ark are the big ones I‚Äôd assume
            Grounded too!
You can change the setting to make it just like Pok√©mon actually
As an almost 33 year old Pok√©mon fan can confirm this is the game we‚Äôve wanted our entire adult lives lol
My husband does not like ark or conan, loves Pokemon, he loves this game.
    The theme is pokemon-esque (which is really just monster catching) but the gameplay is still Ark/Conan.

I loved the concept of Ark but raising an army of dodos and spitters over 2 days to eventually whittle down and capture a raptor got old quick when it took 2 days to get to the taming the raptor only to die a stupid death and have it lost to the map. Then try and find another, succeed in taming, get mobbed *and it's gone*. 

Then I didn't play for a day and my dodos all died of hunger. Then I jumped in my friend's server and saw a 30 day timer for for a brachiosaurus, and noped right out.

Ark was amazing, but it took the survival stuff to the extreme and turned it into a job. Palworld has all the accessibility Ark lacked (I only played the first at launch so no idea if it changed).
It‚Äôs everything that the older Pok√©mon fans who grew up with the franchise have always wanted imo
The game is different. The brand is very similar. Most Pok√©mon players don‚Äôt really care about Pok√©mon‚Äôs gameplay as much as the brand. Having a game that‚Äôs higher quality while providing something other than the same formula is very welcome for those players.
    Which is also why this is a flash in the pan. Pokemons longevity stems from its designs and the comfort of its systems. It might get samey for people after 30 years but it's a continuous guarantee of what you're gonna get and that keeps people coming back when they have that itch. It also has much larger audience as a brand. Card game players, merch collectors, anime enjoyers.

But they always stay for the merch and designs, and that has staying power. Palworld doesn't have that. It's a survival game and while a good one, it's not really a name worth remembering in a year or 5 years. The Pals by and large are forgettable, and the aesthetic of the game is very much  a unity asset store vomit outside of the pals (which themselves are mostly model redesigns of existing pokemon)

It's new gameplay with pokemon at home and once that wears itself out people will move on. Which is a shame cause if palworld had been more unique and focused on its brand it could have grown, but this was a small company and it's not exactly easy to make a successful monster series.

What was closest? Neopets? Even that died in time. The actual successful series are under big corporate umbrellas. Pokemon has nintendo,  digimon has toei/Bandai. Yokai watch has also decline but it too was heavily under nintendo umbrella as their publisher. Its not cheap to create dozens of monsters that have lasting appeal and a world building skill to match
Is don‚Äôt like ark and I don‚Äôt know what Conan exiles is and I love Pok√©mon since 6th grade when red came to the states.  I love palworld I can see why you think it‚Äôs not a great fit for Pok√©mon lovers but I think at its heart it‚Äôs a Pok√©mon game it‚Äôs the only way to level significantly.  I love this game.
    >Is don‚Äôt like ark and I don‚Äôt know what Conan exiles is

So, picture ARK, but with two main changes:

1. Instead of being mostly on tropical/subtropical islands, it's set predominantly in an Iron Age desert (also features some jungles, arctic wastes, and a volcano, but the desert region is both central and ***big***).
2. Instead of fighting and taming dinosaurs, you're primarily fighting cannibals, bandits, and slavers, and are yourself enslaving them (there's still animal taming, but it takes a backseat to the slavery).

...actually, a third important change, too. You can climb up walls like you can in Palworld and Breath of the Wild. I *think* Conan: Exiles might actually have been the first big game to do that, but I'm not certain.
I would say the opposite I think it's shares alot or aspects with Pok√©mon in alot of ways and there is nothing wrong with that
It reminded me a lot of Pokemon legends Arceus which is currently my favorite Pokemon game; right down to the "catch multiple of the same monster" stuff
Correct. Yes they have a catching mechanic like pokemon that even better than the pokemon games BUT they don‚Äôt have the storyline, the battling (except for the towers), they don‚Äôt have the gym battles, etc‚Ä¶ 

I love pokemon and pal work definitely kicks it up a notch but I do wish there was more towns, a story, gym battles, etc.. 

The game is early access. Who know where it‚Äôll go and that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm excited for the most about this game!
Yea game really isn‚Äôt that much like pokemon, battle mechanics are butt currently. I find myself frustrated with how often my pal just wonders around not attacking a boss or the boss completely ignoring my pal to target me.
I wasn't a puppy-kicker before, but palworld helped me change and grow as a person!
Around the same and can confirm it was well worth it.

Usually with games I go hardcore and feel like I have to grind constantly. With this game yeah I grind when I do play, but for some reason I don‚Äôt feel like I have to. The game has so much to enjoy in the various aspects that I know I will play again soon, but don‚Äôt feel pressured to.
There's almost zero story. Pokemon isn't about catching Pokemon, it's about becoming a champion. 

Palworld just has traces around the map and some boss fights.  The majority of players need a path to follow.
    Yup that is in fact valid criticism, in a sense that the game appeals more to the   
1) survival - basebuilding - creativity - exploring formula  
2) gotta catch em' all addictiveness  
3) looting and leveling game-loop (obtain stuff to obtain more/other stuff to obtain more/other stuff etc) 

Personally, 1) doesn't catch me as much as others, I barely decorate as the stuff costs research points that I rather spent on stuff that "does something". However, totally fell for the 2) Paldeck and had to explore and catch everything there was, long before the level of my character/ game would  have me leave the early areas. 3) never really hurts, could've done with less, wouldn't mind more.

The boss towers and I suppose end of the game (the island with the tree..?) were afterthoughts for me, didn't care at all (100hours in and only did 2 towers, haven'g gone to the big tree) but I absolutely see how this type of open world would not work for let's say pokemon players that rather have a narrative and prefer a straight path to progress along
        The game has everything but doesn't shine in anything

Base building is barebones, farming/pet management simulator is barebones too

Figts need balancing

Story non existent

The game is absolutely worth the money, but it has very big room for growth
            Yep. I‚Äôd also argue the tower bosses are‚Ä¶ just there. Even the lowest level boss with Grizzbolt? Is way harder than the content around it. 

The other bosses except maybe Lily are super tough. 

We need to bring the tower bosses into lore other than the logs, because they are kinda just there. Optional content as such.
                The lore, loosely from what I‚Äôve gathered, is that the island used to be ruled by the legends. People and pals lived in harmony. The tower bosses are the leaders of the various groups that changed the landscape by outcasting the legends and humans alike and taking power for themselves. This is why there‚Äôs relatively few unallied humans and the legends live off in their little corners.
        Just FYI you can't make it to the big tree without glitching around the skybox.
        I hope they can change the research point system. I wasted so many points on early items because at that point you could afford everything. Now in the tail end of the game I have to hunt down manuals to unlock what I really want to use.
    I don't believe the majority of players need a path to follow given how many sandbox games are extremely successful.
        Which? The major souls-likes  have a story. Zelda and Skyrim have side quests. Minecraft is probably the one exception.
            7 days to die  
Terraria  
Factorio  
Rimworld  
Ark (mostly)  
Mount & Blade  
Valheim  
Enshrouded
            None of those games are survival sandboxes.

Survivals sole point is you‚Äôre gonna need to explore if you want to survive/progress.

It‚Äôs a genre that really doesn‚Äôt need heavy story elements other than explaining why you‚Äôre in this mess.
            Minecraft, Roblox, Fortnite, GTA, Ark, etc.
    There is some story with the adventurer logs and stuff. Also build your own story based on what you see. There is a reason why there isn't a path to follow.  It's a sandbox game
        Calling the adventurer logs a story is a joke and you know it
            I wouldn't call it a story, more of background information and observations on pals, the world and the various bosses.
            Yeah I like the game but thats kinda cope
        It's like subnautica in a sense
    I think story will come after. These journals we find scattered across the map hint at a bigger picture that we dont see yet, or simply havent got access to. We are told that these powers generate some form of energy and need to be protected.
Just because there is stuff to unlock doesnt mean there is stuff to do TO unlock those things besides grinding, and not everyone likes grindy games
I stopped playing around mid game. You kindve realize it‚Äôs just a massive world in which the only thing you really do is capture pals while traveling around. Sure there‚Äôs the base building aspect too, but even then there‚Äôs not much a point of investing in that once you have all the crafting benches and whatnot
    Yeh the game feels 60% complete which is what the creators have said


I got bored mid game. The gameplay loop got stale real fast once the initial base building and fun levelling was had trying to fill my paldex of pals


Its not fun capturing 10 of each just to get earn big XP. Its extremely repetitive and feels like a chore. Theres not many other ways to earn enough XP to level up for the end game content like defeating the final boss towers or capturing the legendary pals. 


Im stuck in the mid game with a horrendous grind


Dungeons are just a copy and paste job in each area. No interesting POI's for exploration. No random interactions during exploation that are fun. The little villages are a bit of a joke in that at best they have a pal trader and a standard merchant and thats it
I never understand how people clock up those numbers in when the games only been out for so long, like i always feel like i play videogames a lot but ive only hit 400ish on a few games ive played for years
Modern capitalism requires that companies have the highest quarter ever every quarter. It looks bad for shareholders and if they think they won't get their profits they will sell, furthering the issue of profits.

The idea of a company wanting to work on a game out of passion rather than future DLC or future game releases goes directly against what shareholders want.
    As someone who knows nothing about share market and business, cant a company just remain on a shop like level with one guy owning it with hundreds of employee ? Does it always need to be turned into shares type model if it grows successful and large ?
        If they want investments from others rather than using their own money, yes. It's not "required" but most companies that want growth see it as a faster and cheaper way to go about it.
            Not the only way. They could leverage, they could sell minority ownership to one person to retain control, and they can use the profits to grow. Speaking as a business owner, incorporating is NOT even close to the only option.
        It can, see Valve for an example of a company staying private.

But it can be difficult to get serious amounts of investment money into your company without the prospect of turning into a public share model company.
        There's plenty of large private companies but private investment is generally more expensive than public. And much less liquid
            Not to mention that large private companies tend to have less media coverage precisely because there's not as much public interest in their performance.

        If you have investors. They want a higher bottom line every quarter or there will be changes. It honestly kills a lot of games. And I don't know if this is true.. but I heard in the US if you knowingly do something that will cause that bottom line to shrink... Even if it's good for the long-term of the company you can be outed from the company.
    This isnt capitalism this is if anything this comes from confuscionism and arguably socialism. As this sentiment that games always need to be played year round comes from the gaming markets in countries like china and s.korea, where games that can be played year round day in day out are hyper profitable. This is becuase those two ideologies have created societies in which a huge % young men at the bottom have no chance of bettering their lives romantically or economically, so they can afford to and have the time to literally game all the time. Western devs have seen this and are now trying to take adv on western economic downturn aswell.
    Your first paragraph is so far off base‚Ä¶ just shows how many uninformed people there are out there.
Yeah. It didn‚Äôt take long to 100% the game. I spent a little time working aesthetics after that and then it‚Äôs either pause the game or do the breeding grind. 

Frankly I put enough hours in that I‚Äôm entirely satisfied even if I never pick up the game again. 

But it will need some more depth for real replay-ability.
Exactly. The fact that an *unfinished* game still has **315k** players online, on Steam alone no less, a month after dropping with *severe bugs and unfinished content* is a pretty good sign.
Funny, I was actually playing Lies of P when this distracted me :)

But yeah, if it isn't an always online game like an mmo something declining user counts is just business as usual.

Once I am done with this I will go back to P as well probably only returning once it has hit official release to do a fresh playthrough.
CS and Dota are free2play it‚Äôs kinda crazy it surpassed them in the first place as a paid game.
Just look at it now‚Ä¶ I guess those stupid journos were right after all??
    Oh no, 9th place, and 4th place for games that cost money.

What's funny is that 1st through 8th are all live service games. I mean, unless you think people aren't buying GTA V for GTA Online.

Edit: They just announced a raid and have been fixing bugs since launch. I think they'll be fine, barring the CEO of Pocket Pair picking up a cocaine addiction or them never leaving early access like craftopia.
> These morons can't understand that once you "beat" a singleplayer game most people just stop playing and multi-player games are designed to be an endless gameplay loop

Lol they're well aware, my dude. They write click bait bullshit because their job is to write click bait bullshit because the kind of dumdum that clicks on click bait bullshit is also more likely to click through ads.  Journalism sucks because people don't want to pay for journalism.
    Yeah I was mostly referring to the mindless consoomers and dumbasses in general talking about player count it's always all about the money with business
I stopped playing it because it felt unfinished and I want to come back later. So, there‚Äôs that reason too.
It's not a fair comparison because unlike those 3 games Elden Ring and Palworld aren't multiplayer focused games.
No.

I cannot believe I have to spell this out, but it is Reddit after all.

It‚Äôs normal for a game to lose players after launch.

These ‚Äúarticles‚Äù are trying to stir up shit from nothing. Palworld still has 500k. Baldur‚Äôs Gate 3 still had like 140k or so. 

These games aren‚Äôt ‚Äúdead‚Äù, the content has just been completed by most players, and people will return when new content comes out.
    Doubtful, it‚Äôs a fad game. I‚Äôm impressed it got so high by just milking the pokemon similarities. Literally Arc with pokemon nothing new or creative. Game will keep falling because people have already played this game with a different skin.

It‚Äôs not a game as a service, so the player count doesn‚Äôt matter. People continuing to play the game on official servers actually will cost it money. It made its millions. Now they can hire more staff and build the game up better. Then, when new content drops, players will come back and check it out.

So it is litteral clickbait. The amount of players is a meaningless number. You don‚Äôt need a population. Are you the type of person ‚ÄúGame lost players, bad game, can‚Äôt play bad game.‚Äù?
 And it's still #3 on Steam most players even with that dropoff. So...who cares?
Nope. It‚Äôs a single player/co-op game. Nothing has changed.

Elden Ring for example will continue to rise as we get closer to the DLC, hit its peak again during it, then drop once again.

And so will Palworld. It will rise when the new raid comes out, then drop again.
    It has decreased in player count week over week every day since release. 

It has retained less than 5% of its player base.
        Just like any other non-live service game? Like wtf are you even saying?

How many people are playing The Witcher 2 right now???!
            Elden ring did not lose 95% of its player base in a month. Neither did baldurs gate.

I am not even going to respond to your attempt at a comparison because it is utterly asinine and ridiculous.
Yes. Which is NORMAL. Declining player base because users beat the game is how gaming worked for decades before gaming as a service. 

Imagine beating The Last of Us and being like "boy, the player base is declining".
it's an early acess game? Are you expecting infinite playability?
    At least a way to keep you entertained. Now there's literally nothing to do.
        Nothing to do and nothing *you want* to do are different.
            Mr condenser over here
                I mean, it's something to do.
                    Tis true. Y'all have fun with that king
        So‚Ä¶ play a new game‚Ä¶ Jesus

Yeah, the game is early access‚Ä¶. You got a brain?

The development isn‚Äôt done. I think you should stay away from early access and stop playing what everyone tells you to play.
why don‚Äòt you up the drops? Less grinding, more exploring
    Exactly what I did. Every time a portion of the game got boring, too grindy or tedious, I changed the settings, used We Mod or downloaded mods to go through it faster.

Breeding is the best example. I made a maxed out Anubis with LV 5 handiwork. That took forever and wasn't interested in doing that again with other pals so I downloaded a mod to make eggs instantly and one where I only need 1 pal per level to condense.
        Ooo that‚Äôs a really fantastic idea! I don‚Äôt mind some grinding but breeding is so tedious. I‚Äôve never used mods before but I also heard there‚Äôs one that lets you share items in boxes between bases so maybe I‚Äôll start looking into that :)
            Hopefully they're paying attention to mod creation and traction, then integrate the most popular mods into game mechanics.

Like, say, you're happy with your second/third base placement and you want to share resources. Now you have to lay down a rail or pipe system between bases to enable that. Takes time to build and gets attacked as you're building, but once built is safe and makes all materials available.

Or maybe it's never safe from attack and another building near the transfer tiles in the tech tree opens up a command and conquer style game play where you send in pals from the box to counter attack.

Breeding seems to have the most complaints. Create a nursery pal or two that ups high IV odds / makes attaining the perks you want easier. Could adjust them so the benefits from them grow as you breed/capture stronger pals.
        I'm playing the game on hard mode... But I think I'll have dedicated breeding days where I turn it to easy. Because ain't no way I'm waiting days for breeding.

The fact the timers stop the moment you exit the game is insane to me.... Having to play 20+ hours for a large egg.. absurd.

Nothing else grindy bothers me though. I'm happy to not rush through the game like most people, having nothing left to do in game.

Plus, I'm thinking, if you rush to overpowered pals.. then all of the games challenge is Really eliminated. It's not like there's pvp yet. You're just gonna be blasting through bosses and to collecting things, and repeat.

 Now That can get Boring!
            Well as long as people had fun playing at the pace they did it's good. I definitely did the end game stuff faster than most would, but I had fun. Anyways I still have things to do
            Huh? Is that a single player thing? I'm on a server, and the egg timers keep going when you log off. Having to actually wait 20 hours in game is terrible
                Yup. It's cause servers run all the time
    I‚Äôm preconditioned to believe if I change any settings from normal I will not get achievements‚Ä¶ and meaningless computer awards are more important than streamlining the game to my available time. I see your logic and I will take it under consideration.
    Most casual players are not going to them know where that setting is
farm gold and find the merchants that sell ammo or materials to be in your base
Yep, I switched my egg hatch timer to instant and even then I found it way too boring to even bother with, I also upped my mined items boost to 3x once I got to level 48 because the cost of crafting spheres is way too high imo, it's almost like the game doesn't want you to catch high level pals
Put the breeding eggs to zero timer. The 2 hour wait is purely gimmick. You have better things to do than just kill 2 hours and hope it‚Äôs a good egg or not etc
Yeah, I don't think I'd have an issue if my mine base actually worked while I wasn't standing afk there. And maybe let me buy palfluids for the cement crafting.
I want to max out a bee squad (eliz & 4 beegardes) as well as a swee squad, and also multiple 4 member squads for maxing the elemental damage of whatever 5th pal I choose, but I also can't be bothered lmao.
Yeah you can increase drops by like 5x and then just get a fuck ton of ammo in one trip. No need to grind menial stuff unless you like to.
Yeah, at this point I think "will it continue?" is 100% up to devs. At the current point in time it's fun and playable, but content is limited. Unless you get deep into base-building or breeding, there's only so much time you can spend on the game. More pals, more plot, and more map will decide this game's future.
    Honestly the building sucks ass also they need to add more building freedom when it comes to things clipping into each other like imagine building a nice looking roof without it looking ugly or slowing us to clip those triangles into the sides of stairs or leting us clip 2 walls into eachother for an X shape anything the only thing would be rules about crafting stations


In short just br more lenient about objects clipping into other objects to make it easier to make things look nice
    Yeah a story would be great not just lore. It beats Pokemon out in graphics and I guess bugs not being everywhere. Everything else not really. PVP will probably be just shooting, since the pals are AI controlled, there no story. Just lore in books.
Even if the devs stop after 2 or 3 years, the modding community will keep it alive. It's like Minecraft. Played it from alpha till today, thanks to mods...
Its not even a full game yet lol. So when it fully releases, itll have more content,  and hopefully be more user friendly
Not just that but it probably has large spikes when a new update releases that  adds stuff
4 minutes am guessing you guys did it twice then
    I mean yeah have you seen how effective Hitachi's are?
You‚Äôre very welcome, Capitalist pig! üôÇ
And scarlet and violet turned into poison ivy
I love Palworld don‚Äôt get me wrong, but knowing the poke community I don‚Äôt think they actually would WANT this. Pokemon is kind of like Nintendo‚Äôs COD in a sense. They‚Äôve got a large diehard base and they‚Äôre able to print money with relatively few changes to the formula each iteration. 

They branched out a bit with Arceus, but did you notice how they went back to the old formula with scarlet and violet? They‚Äôve got their market share captured already, it just really isn‚Äôt us. 

I would say Cassette Beasts and TemTem are closer analogues to Pokemon and I‚Äôd like to see those competitors continue to spring up. I would also like to see solid Palworld competitors pop up too, but I think that is going to be a higher barrier of entry for developers given the scale of Palworld and the sandbox element of it.
    They didn't really "go back to the old formula" with Scarlet/ Violet, they were both in development at the same time¬† by different teams. The next generation of pokemon games is when we will actually see what they took away from their experiments with Arceus and if it will change their core approach to the series.
    Agreed but pokemon is still falling and will probably still get more games but I just think that at this point alot of fans will stay back the only problem is people will still buy it and play it for a few days or a week or 2 at most. people complain about pokemon being bad alot anymore but if it's so bad then don't buy it it's probably due to hype or just high expectations for a company that really only cares about money anymore and how many people buy it
        > Agreed but pokemon is still falling

Pokemon on the Switch has sold the most copies of any games in the franchise sans Red and Blue
        ¬†"pokemon is still falling"

This is what being terminally online does to a motherfucker lmao.
            Yeah, you can dislike Pokemon since you 'outgrown it' but to say it falling off is stupid. It a household name nobody really knows palworld except for gamers.
    The ark style game has been replicated many many times only difference is ark actually keeps improving after they get paid, palworlds devs or what ever u call them have a bad history of letting games die sooo we will see. Nintendo just is stale and honestly the Zelda games r the only games I consider AAA even digital Pok√©mon is a small fan base considering. Palworld hit a sweet spot with it being fun for everyone they would be dumb not to keep it alive
I know it's a meme to compare it to Pokemon but It's funny how you got downvotes for this. 

The game is far more like ARK than anything, monster catching isn't just a Pokemon thing.
Yeah that‚Äôs what happened /s ü§°
The first step is models but models are not separated by gender so... They already have two Challenger and i'm not Even mentioning rings for movement and all that


And since is early access any APi could change and break everything.... So we are at years long
    Well, OK overhaul mod manages to change textures based on traits and stuff, so that's already some ways into it XD
The furry artists are already WAY ahead of you.
This game worth.
There‚Äôs a breeding farm already for pals. I think this dude just wants the game to show them actually doing the nasty
    Or he want to do nasty things..........
It‚Äôs honestly a significant problem in the mid game. You‚Äôre pretty much just sitting there watching your pal do all the work because anything you can do is negligible. Add on to that there is very little you can do to direct pals in combat, and it becomes very un-engaging. If they want to keep the emphasis on pals doing the combat damage, adding in more ways for players to interact with their pals in combat would be ideal. Even just a block command that you could time to reduce damage would make it way more engaging.
    More importantly, seeing tour pal destroy the pal you wanted to catch. There should be some weaken option for your pals instead of kill or not kill, so they auto stop
        Kinda like false swipe right?
Let‚Äôs not forget Yellow. The best of all 3 imo
Each new Pok√©mon game is heavily advertised tho, they aren‚Äôt gonna heavily advertise each new content patch are they
Because people can't stand it when they get served straight facts when they love something.
It‚Äôs the palworld sub bro it‚Äôs like going to a nursing home and calling everyone old fucks they gonna get mad
because it ignores the part where most players have spent 100+ hours in this game
    I did say this game is worth the money, and i have 100 hours in it.
    Yes. The monster catching + base building mechanic does make the game addicted.
I‚Äôm looking at you massive tree I can‚Äôt reach
    I was so sad when I hit the red wall üò¢

I had a good thirty seconds of denial. I was like "maybe I just need to come from a different angle"

Then I finally accepted the truth that I would not get to the tree
        You can go "over" the red wall but then there's another invisible barrier thats a bit closer to the tree
            Fun fact. Technically its not an other invisible barrier, its the collision of the tree.
The fect that pocket pair uses unreal engine 5.1 for palworld and the default collision for a imported model is a  "simple"  collision  what that does is it is looking at the form of the model and than make a collision barrier around the full model fromfrom top to bottom.
But it the gonna set the collision to " use  complex collision" it would look at the model and based on the polygons of the model its would be the same for the collision.
So its really just the model collision and not a invisible barrier 

But i think the devs didn't predict that the players still could find a way to go over it. 

Still a good place to make a farming base as i did  its mostly flat and no other pals or raids comming there
        I, too, tried to go around it. For a good minute I went along the red wall, hoping there would be a way in‚Ä¶
    I will never forget the sound in my friends voice when I told him he was not going to reach the tree, about 3 seconds before he hit the wall.
    Praise the Erdtree
    There is hint In the opening scene something will be done with that tree
The bottom right corner of the map seems fit for a few new islands and a max level bump.
    There's been talk that the portion available to us is part of a big chain of islands surrounding the big tree in the distance. Could possibly up the level cap, and introduce new islands with new pals that way
        On that note the devs said they‚Äôre planning for 4 major releases, which would correspond to the 3 other corners and the island of the big tree itself
            Hope one of those updates includes a huge underground system
        They have already stated new Islands would be coming
        The big tree concept sounds super intriguing, like it could be a central hub connecting these islands, and maybe each island has its own unique ecosystem? That'd keep things fresh and give a reason to explore, more than just a level cap incentive. Plus, imagine if each new island came with its own set of challenges or environmental hazards to survive.
            That's what I'm hoping, something different environmentally as well as the pals that'll spawn

Considering what they put out to start with, I do have hope they could give us something exciting with new islands and such
            >That'd keep things fresh

So what you're saying is that right now we are in Kanto, soon there will be Johto and eventually Hoenn, Sinnoh, Unova and (checks notes...) _Paldea_.
    According to game code, level isn't hard capped until 80 but it's currently blocked at 50. So there is at least a plan to go to 80 at the moment.
        At 10 level increments. Primary release to 50. 3 expansion releases at 10 levels a piece.
            Would make sense too, I really don‚Äôt see the next update suddenly adding lvl 80 pals (and the next updates 100/140)
            In a year or 2 mabye
        I feel like they need to add more requirements for leveling after 50 too. Like to get to 60 you need xp and a certain amount of your paldex filled out or something just to make it a little harder to max out
    I'd rather that be changed into water focused zone, but everything else I agree with.  


I'd like to have to ride a pal with "surf" in order to get out there and then use a pal with "dive" in order to breach the water and explore and catch deep sea pals.
        I get what you‚Äôre saying but flying mounts kind of make that unnecessary. I still would like them to add that kind of stuff as an option. Underwater areas would be so cool. They could even add scuba gear.
            There are possible lore accurate ways to prevent flying in certain places to make use of other kinds of mechanics
                I think that would be a bad move personally
                    Don't want caves or underwater bioms?
                        I do but I still want the option to fly over water. Maybe I misunderstood
                Tbh they should just make your flying pal go back into its ball if they ‚Äúland‚Äù over water while mounted in order to make water pals more useful
                    Not from just landing on water, but maybe if they run out of stamina and fall onto water.
            Eh, the way the stamina system works with flying mounts, it's more efficient to just take a water mount that doesn't drain stam when in the water for long ocean trips, then switch once you make landfall, rather than starting out with a flyer and having to take frequent rest stops
            If there's a water mount that surfs faster than flying mounts then they would be viable
            Flying mounts do make you descend every once in a while which is kind of annoying and a different experience than a water mount, which I'd definitely like.
JUST LET ME GO TO THE TREE!¬†
    You can "get" to the tree and go past the wall, but there's nothing there. It's currently set dressing.

But that tree is definitely important. All the skill fruits grow on trees seemingly made of paldium. All the dungeon final rooms have a larger tree that is similar to the skill fruit trees.

I have a feeling that big tree is the source of the paldium, the origin of the pals, and likely will be the finale of the planned updates.
        I think it even says as much in the journals or in some of the item flavor text. Something about the energy from the tree making palladium and it's carried through the water which is why all the small palladium rocks spawn by oceans/rivers
            Great, there goes who knows how many hours searching out the journals.
YES. LET ME GO TO THE TREE.   
WE YEARN FOR THE TREE.
I saw someone post an idea where they expand the map with the big tree as the center and the current map is only a quarter of the whole thing. This is now what I hope will happen.
Based on one analysis somewhere in this sub Reddit, the current map takes up a potential 25% of the total area
Big map???????????????

I‚Äôve already explored about 70-80% of the map‚Ä¶ the frozen zones are the only places I haven‚Äôt been‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm around lvl 25-30.

Hit 90 of 111 Pals‚Ä¶

Best pretty much all the Pal Bosses up to level 30‚Ä¶

Beat Zoe‚Ä¶ the only boss I‚Äôve fought so far‚Ä¶

Setup a mining operation with Anubis x5, Verdash x3, a water type and a Shadowbesk to haul materials to the chests‚Ä¶

And I‚Äôm bored with it‚Ä¶
That‚Äôs what I noticed to, all these ‚Äústructures‚Äù, but they are just scenery.
    Being pre release they can easily work on density as well as expanding.

The map is beautiful,  just lacking in content and story in it.  Even just bumping the spawn rate to 3x makes the world feel so much more alive.
not like wildcard was a huge team when they started making ark, were they? palworld has practically unlimited budget right now, i think they could afford to expand the team a little and hire some more artists/map designers if that's truly what they wanted to do. I think most people would prefer them to just add on to the current map though, maybe have a loading screen to a new "region" or something after taking a boat where it's essentially a new map, assuming they can't just keep expanding the existing single map because of performance reasons.
    There was a rumor that the giant tree would become the true center of a bigger map and your be able to select which region around the tree you'd wanna spawn
        this would be very cool
    sadly wildcard bit more than they could chew and it blew up in their faces
        wildcard made truly awful decisions one after another even after getting bailed out numerous times. im expecting ark 2 to be some kind of singleplayer only game, or at least heavily narrative based. it just seems so odd to me they're spending all this time making ARK: SA when ARK 2 is supposedly coming out this year. they're gonna have two competing games in the same franchise confusing new players. why they wouldn't just keep making ARK 2 until it's done I don't know, maybe they desperately needed a cash infusion or maybe I'm right and it's not gonna be a pvp survivalcraft at all.
            Because a huge percentage of the ark player base has absolutely zero interest in a third person only arksouls conan evolved game. People just wanted ark to work properly and be playable. Unfortunately ASA is the same turd as ASE except this turd has been rolled in glitter.
                i mean, tons of people play ark in third person. i'm not making any definitive assumptions on gameplay until we see gameplay footage or their marketing ramps up.
            Well, ARK 2 is going to be nothing like ARK: SA, ARK 2 is a souls like narrative driven game and will be almost an entirely different game from ARK: SA, the only thing that will link ARK 2 to the original ARKs will be the lore and dinosaurs

The reason they made ARK: SA was to please fans of ARK: SE Since most of us didn‚Äôt want a souls like version of ARK, we wanted regular ARK
                Are you sure about that? I don't think they ever said anywhere ARK 2 *wouldn't* be survival craft, but they said it would have more soulsy on-foot combat, which doesn't mean a survival craft is dead. But idk.
                    Well im sure its gonna still have survival crafting, but last I checked they were focusing on 3rd person souls like exploration/combat which is absolutely different than what we have in ARK:SE/A Which is unique
They have enough money to hire at least 10/20 devs/designers lol
    Also, Microsoft will be bankrolling them. They want this to become their Mario/Poke/GOW
        Indoubtedly
    100 / 200
    They already have 14 programmers and 5 game designers, for reference.
Yeah my backlog went even further because I‚Äôve been playing this like crazy
I think the biggest appeal to palworld for Pokemon fans (including myself) is that palworld plays like the Pokemon games have always described the world, even though we never really experienced it in those games.

The Pokemon games always talked about how people lived and worked alongside Pokemon, but we only got to battle. The games talked about how dangerous Pokemon were without your own to defend yourself from them, but you always had one. The games talked about how evil and exploitative criminal organizations were without in any way describing how they could be. (to be fair on this point, palworld doesn't really show the syndicates engage in exploitation either, but the actions available to the player do a good job of filling in the blanks, should you go that route) There's a lot of dark themes hinted at in Pokemon games as well, but it's always got that Disney candy-coating on top that keeps it from ever actually feeling significant.

In a lot of ways, Palworld simply delivers on the *promise* Pokemon games have been giving us for years without following through.
    Totally agree. Pokemon games only ever touch on the dark side through pokedex entries or text. You almost never really see the brutal side of a pokemon world.
        This is why I loved Legends Arceus so much, it started dipping its toes into the darker side, like the casual mention of Pokemon wanting to murder you. But then they threw that away with scarlet and violet, and Legends only just barely dipped its toes in. Palworld just dove head first into the darkness
            Doesn‚Äôt Palworld‚Äôs reminds you quite a bit of arceus? It definitely made me go hmmmmm
                Literally the only relation it has is that it's cute creatures caught in balls and it's open world. Totally different concept otherwise if you ask me. The similarities are numerous but it's really not as similar as alot of people say. (I'll admit I've accidentally called some pals by the Pokemon they look similar to
    Such a good way of putting it
How do you feel about the pal vs pal combat out of curiosity? Despite how much I love this game I think the AI is one of the game‚Äôs biggest weaknesses and I actually do not feel this was an improvement. 

Not saying they can‚Äôt potentially fix and improve the combat AI, but it‚Äôs a little frustrating seeing my Anubis stumped by object permanence when he runs into a pillar during a tower fight. I‚Äôm also not holding my breath on the combat AI being fixed because I think that‚Äôs one of the more difficult challenges to tackle and they haven‚Äôt mentioned it being a priority to my knowledge.
    Honestly its pretty fucking boring without greater control over your pals who cant be mounted. I'm not really excited for pvp until combat is improved from a competetive standpoint.

In terms of fulfilling a monster-tamer fantasy? It meets the mark, and has a leg up on pokemon as you can use many many more monsters as mounts, and even mounted combat
    I think simply adding a 4th move and the option to select which move they use via the radial wheel where you pet and choose aggro would do wonders for this. I'd be kind of surprised if they're not working in the ai, though considering that's a huge complaint of the community and pocket pair seems to listen well.
        I personally wouldn‚Äôt even necessarily be frustrated with them if they couldn‚Äôt fix it. It would go a long way toward making the game a better experience but npc AI seems to be something even AAA studios struggle with sometimes. 

I don‚Äôt know what all they‚Äôre working with, but if they keep putting out content and fixing what they can I‚Äôll be coming back. That just happens to be the biggest item on my wishlist.
    >How do you feel about the pal vs pal combat out of curiosity?

honestly its pretty bad right now, The bigger pals are janky as fuck, and their moves are even more janky. The AI is also pretty bad. Hopefully it gets fixed in the future
Im ngl ark did the ‚Äò‚Äôark‚Äô‚Äô style survival so bad its not even funny

Conan is a slight bit better but still overall suffers from the same issues ark does but palworld however took that style further and improved on it hard
    All I ever did in conan was tame animals and use them for all my combat anyway haha
Gigantic pokemon fan here too. I love palworld but I think it's dumb to compare the two. For a start pokemon is conditional turn based which opens the door whereas palworld has no strategy, just shoot
    When my level 25 tanzie is fighting a mammoth, there is definitely strategy. Lol
    Pokemon hasn't evolved that formula in 20 years. All it took was a team to make the pokemon game people wanted from Nintendo for years and it sold like wildfire.
        I love Pal world. They did a lot of great things.

What they did not do is deliver a strategy game; and pokemon very much is. Lots of mind games with the team you bring to a rank match, because you don‚Äôt use all of them; the switches you make mid battle to try to gain a type advantage; the move selection you choose and the type coverage it offers.

And I will **always** prefer evolutions on my creature collectors. I don‚Äôt really like having 2 pals that are clearly related. I don‚Äôt care about world building, I care about how I used my pengullet for 20 levels: I don‚Äôt want to capture a new penking, I want my pengullet to evolve

Palworld **changed** and then improved on Pok√©mon. I still want the open world ‚Äúpokemon‚Äù game too. I‚Äôm greedy sure; but I know Nintendo is too

Edit: ‚Äútiming‚Äù does not equal ‚Äústrategy‚Äù. palworld has zero strategy involved. It‚Äôs an action game where we can use actions to time switches to gain a benefit. But there is no ‚Äúshould I try to dodge, or should I face tank it‚Äù. You should try to dodge.

Double edit: I forgot this sub is full of children who have to go ‚ÄúAcTuAlY‚Äù to every little thing. Thank you for giving me the push to leave the sub
            If you try facing enemy's 5 levels above you, strategy, assigned attacks and subbing out are very much a thing as your guns do literally 9-11 damage per hit. I'm not to fussed on evolutions myself, as most are unique enough to not seem related in the way you draw lines between pokemon lineage.
                Pulling Pals defensively to avoid attacks is also something to be mindful of during a fight.
                I would claim that ‚ÄúSubbing‚Äù in this game is not a ‚Äústrategy‚Äù. All you think is ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to get hit better recall my pal‚Äù. It‚Äôs a test of your timing skill, not your critical thinking skill

While Subbing in pokemon is deciding to give your opponent an immediate benefit, so that you can gain a future benefit; that is strategy
                    Eh, it's still boiling back to live vs turn based, in a live pokemon battle you also wouldn't have time to map a strategy like you do in turnbased, it's tennis vs chess.

Edit: not sure why you blocked me after last reply but OK lol
                        
Then open world pokemon game will still be turn based, just like Arcues/Scarlet/violet‚Ä¶what‚Äôs your point?

Edit: I blocked them for continuing to change what I am trying to talk about and ignoring what I was saying‚Ä¶.this wasn‚Äôt a discussion it was the other user talking at me.

Edit for the person below; I hope you get the help you need friend ‚ù§Ô∏è
            Turn based combat is a very heavy mechanic in pokemon, but I dont really see it as a defining feature at all and is incredibly boring and dated imho
                bro turn based combat is like, a hallmark of many s-tier rpg's lol. that's like saying fps is boring and dated because its a heavy mechanic in doom/wolfenstein. (for the record i'm not dissing you for disliking turn based combat, i see what you're getting at)
                    I don't think they were saying that turn-based combat ***in general*** is boring and dated, but rather that ***Pokemon's*** turn-based combat is boring and dated... which is accurate, IMO. They really haven't changed it all that much from the original Pokemon games.
                        Mmm fair point lol. Pokemon‚Äôs rigid formula is incredibly stale and I haven‚Äôt fully played through one since sword/shield, which i found exceedingly disappointing
                        Because it's a solid system and doesn't have to change. If you e played competitive pokemon you'll see that pokemons turn based gameplay is actually very intense, turn by turn reads and plays are wild. If you're into chess and card games, competitive pokemon would be right up your alley. 

What the games need are better stories, better AI, and higher difficulty. And even then, the latest DLC actually gave us an entire zone where every battle was a double battle with the NPCs using real items and strats, they're getting there finally.
                Turn based combat as a whole will never be ‚Äúdated‚Äù what are you smoking? 

People care about their joints; we can‚Äôt just play button smashing action games all the time. That‚Äôs how you get carpal tunnel
                    I don't mind turn based combat in abstract 2d games but with the modern 3d style of new pokemon games it's pathetic
                        Why?

Edit: *is it ‚Äúpathetic‚Äù*
                Lol there is a global level tournament for pokemon battling, it is the basis of how the card game works, it's what the anime is based on, it is the core gameplay system of the series for almost 30 years...


How is that NOT a defining feature? You can think it's boring and you're welcome to your opinion but it's a silly stance to take as truth. Is chess boring? Hasn't changed its gameplay in actual centuries yet it's still the most recognized boardgame/strategy game in the world? Is LoL boring for not having changed its gameplay in the 15 years since its release?

YOU might not care for it and that's a fine opinion to have, same as I don't care for shooters. But let's not live in our own mental canon where mainline pokemon games ARENT DEFINED by their turn based strategy elements. That's like saying main Mario games arent defined by their platforming elements. It's a silly take.

It's not boring, it's not dated. It's actually very intense, takes a lot of practice and game knowledge to be good at and has a rich strategic elements. Again you don't have to love it but calling it boring and dated is like calling chess boring and dated.
        "The game people wanted", no, think what you might like, most fans *don't* want something edgy or over the top like Palworld.
            You can deny it as long as you want, but the majority of people who bought it love pokemon and are keen to see the more adult pokemon world, meanwhile pokemon still tries to sanitise the whole enslaving creatures to cockfight aspect.
                Or majority bought it for the memes and don't engage in the vocal group that say "THIS IS WHAT POKEMON SHOULD BE LIKE"
                    Like I said feel, free to deny it as long as you want
    PalWorld isn‚Äôt like the Pok√©mon GAMES. PalWorld is like how the world of Pok√©mon is actually described by GameFreak and even the anime.
    "Just shoot" is the same take as "Just press A" in turn-based games. 

Palworld has more skill expression than Pokemon, it just doesn't matter with the current game state because there's no reason to do it.
        More things in common with Pokemon in a way lol. There's lots of knowledge and skill expression in Pokemon that very few ever even touch because the base game doesn't challenge you enough.
    Gigantic Pok√©mon fan here. Pok√©mon was never good because of the battle system. But for the team building and fun world. Palworld just improves that by alot
        Gigantic Pokemon fan here. Team building only matters because of the battle system. The fun world is only an additional part. You remove the battle system, and it stops feeling like Pokemon and just feels like chaos.

Palworld is entirely different because of this. There‚Äôs no strategy. You can actually return your Pals as a move is hitting them to prevent damage and then send them back out. Typings don‚Äôt matter cause any Pal can learn any type move and STAB is negligible compared to other passives.
            Eh. I've played multiple Pok√©mon games where I shot through with the same team for pretty much the entire game, ignoring the battle system.
                This is my beef with a lot of the newer Pokemon games tbh. Ever since they turned the exp share on permanently, you don‚Äôt really even have to try anymore for the most part. 

There are some good mods and stuff out there though where strategy is definitely still very important. And that does make for a much more engaging experience imo. 

I do love both Pokemon and Palworld but I agree that they give different vibes - at least when Pokemon is done right or is at a competitive level.
                    You never really needed to use more than one pokemon. You could just overlevel one pokemon and then keep the rest as revive sacrifices.
            its better than pokemon just deal with it they did what hey should have done palsworld should partner with digimon for their first cosmetic drop
            That's the thing. Team building in palworld doesn't just revolve around the battling. You have to consider traversal, resource gathering and the environment and time of day. Not to mention the whole base team. If the battle system was the most important thing in Pok√©mon how come the anime, the card game, pokken, mystery dungeon, snap etc still feels like Pok√©mon

There is a lot of strategy. Tho the strategy is different. You have to think more on your feet. There isn't a pause to give you time to plan. Typings matter arguably more than in Pok√©mon because of the simplified type chart..
                There really isn't a lot of strategy. Game is piss easy, which isn't a bad thing, but you can go guns blazing and succeed more often than not lol



Half the stuff you listed is a bit of a reach. Traversal options don't require strategy. It boils down to use flier or use ground mount. Thats it. 


Hell, you can completely ignore type advantages and still win. It won't even be difficult.
            >Palworld is entirely different because of this. There‚Äôs no strategy.

Pokemons strategy is exclusively type countering, pokemon also has potions which completely negate using any strategy. Which is fine because the game is designed that way.

Theres a reason why every pokemon game, if you exclusively use your starter you will go through every bad type match up gym completely out leveling them. Not to mention types don't even matter when you can learn adjacent type abilities.
                This was basically my strat as a kid. Went through every generation up to platinum just using my starter to burst through everything. 

Strategy: grass type? Charizard. Flying type? Charizard water type? Charizard

Except Fire Red, where I was possessed by the rat spirit and went through the game with 2 Rattata that never evolved.
            So do you like Palworld still or not really. Genuine question.
            Well by that logic Pokemon has no strategy either. You can steamroll through with just one move ignoring type altogether as long as you level a single mon enough. And that's exactly how I played it when I was a kid
            I agree! By now I've played Palworld to level 45 with a bunch of friends, beating every single tower boss but Victor/Shadowbeak and capturing every single Alpha pal available. The combat system is fine for as long as shooting up bullets and rockets into pocket monsters seem funny to you. Gets boring really fast, specially if you're hoping to find any tactical approach. It all boils down to variance and design space.

It could be easily remedied by increasing the relevancy of Pal/move types and Unique Abilities. Something easily done and worked on given enough time to playtest and refine. 

For reference: 
ON POK√âMON Type advantage may go up to 4x or 400% move damage. 
Disadvantage may go down to 0.25x or 25% or even 0 (Type immunity)
STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) adds 50% of a move's power to its total power before calculation if it has the same typing as the user.

ON PALWORLD type advantage may go up to 1.4x or 140% move damage. That's 260% less upwards variance than pok√©mon.
Disadvantage goes down to 0.6x or 60% move damage. That's 45% less downwards variance than pok√©mon, 60% less if you consider the lack of immunity in Palworld. (although these numbers might not be precise, they might actually err to less)
STAB on Palworld also adds only 20% to a move's power before damage calc. (confirmed value) That's 30% less impactful than pok√©mon.

The result is a dumbed down version of the pok√©mon battle system requiring little care for choice and variance. Since its conception, pok√©mon gym leaders employ monotype team compositions SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED to give the player an edge by growing a cast with flexible offensive options, instead of grinding your head into a wall.

On Palworld, you can hop on a Ragnahawk or Pyrin with 4 Gobfin on bench and breeze your way through the ENTIRE game. Alternatively, dark-type Nocturnal Pyrin, Frostallion Noct, Helzephyr, Maraith or Nox (These all do the exact same thing. Really, search it up.) and the same Gobfin setup would work. You can easily optimize Palworld by having monotype teams, or teams entirely dedicated to boosting player attack and defense. Which is fine and dandy if it were only an option, and not the playstyle you're forced to take.


Some pok√©mon are allowed to have busted 600 total stats by possessing typing that's disadvantageous to common attacks in the game, such as Mega Scizor, Genesect, Kommo-o, Tyranitar. Alternatively even weak 500 stats are made battle viable through a combination of synergistic typing+ability, such as Eelektross, Spiritomb and Shedinja, having either no weaknesses or being immune to most offensive moves.

On Palworld, none of this would even matter, since damage variance on typing is negligible and there is no immunity for some reason. It's simply damage % stacking upon damage. You can just mash numbers against a wall and it will break, and that's the most if not only viable strategy. This implies a greatly limited design space and variety. New additions to the game will only have bigger and bigger stats with higher damage moves, since that's the only way to make Pals relevant. The current system is made to be powercrept when it could be so much more.

It doesn't help that there is a grand variety of 137 Pals counting environmental variants, with 75% of the "unique" Abilities providing one thing and one thing only: % damage boost. no immunity to anything (such as Lightning Rod or Flash Fire). no speed boost. no speeding up cast time. no conditions to acquire higher stats (such as Guts or Moxie). no applying negative effects (such as Intimidate). no weather effects (such as Sandstream, Drought, Drizzle, etc you get the gist.) Just pure unconditional damage increase. Basically all battle-oriented pals have fucking Huge Power and you can mount on them sometimes. Even then, the most exquisite mount abilities such as active rocket launchers and firethrowers actually just suck, they're extremely underwhelming: completely defeating the purpose of the game's "rule of cool". Seriously think about how cool would be a Pal with weather altering abilities, bringing upon a rain or thunderstorm when it's summoned. Instead we have "Generic Partner Skill Name #78: Boost type damage". or "Generic Partner Skill Name #110: Apply type damage".
                You competely ignore the fact that in virtually every Pok√©mon game, you can literally get through the entire game if you just use your starter the entire time. Many people point out this is what they did as a kid, myself included. Pok√©mon games require no tactical approach unless you actively introduce it yourself (something I unconsciously started doing myself on later runs/games by purposely swapping out my starter).
                TL;DR: Palworld is very simplified and basic in combat design (active/passive/unique skills & typings) meaning there‚Äôs very little strategy, even in team building.

You got me with the ‚ÄúBasically all battle-oriented mons have fucking huge power.‚Äù I never saw it like that until you pointed it out.

I also realized that, because any Pal can learn any move, any meta will always boil down to having multiple of the same Pal on your team. Let‚Äôs say you don‚Äôt care about unique skills, Pal A has the highest base attack stat in the game. You would want to use Pal A in multiple forms because STAB doesn‚Äôt matter and move pools don‚Äôt matter. Why would you use Pal B with a lower base attack stat when Pal A does literally the same thing (again, ignoring Unique Skills)? I don‚Äôt think the unique skills are good enough for you to pass up Pal A for Pal B.
                A very in depth explanation of why this game is too easy.
    How exactly do you look at the Pal spheres, and the "collect em all" gameplay and NOT think Pokemon?
        I think they are saying that the *gameplay* of the two games aren't easy to compare. The aesthetics are a ripe comparison, yes.
    What if palworld added optional turn-based mode. Would that be possible and has any game done that?
Dude I hated ark there was high level dinosaurs in the starting area that I got spawn killed by every time I tried to get my loot bag
    Yup, sounds like Ark. I love Ark, but I doubt I'd love it if I didn't love dinosaurs. Shit is a nightmare very often. 


And that's before the inevitable bugs.
Lets wait on judging IVs until we see competitive.  If competitive works around IVs then IVs are not a problem because they would only be an optional carrot you dont need to have.  If people are stressing about IVs without competitive just for the PVE.....that's not a game problem that's a them problem.    


Ain't no content in the game hard enough to require min/maxed IVs.  Also playing around IVs if you wish to is not 100 or 0.  You can easily just say "anything top 20% of IVs is good enough.
> in every way except IV breeding

I understand why some people like this part of pokemon and other games, but honestly I wish games like this would step *away* from the eugenics grind. It's such a monotonous grind and it feels really bad to me to have a creature/partner that I've been training/raising since the start of the game become obsolete because its great*9 grandchild rolled better stats and passives. Makes it pointless to become attached to anything or care about investing resources in anything until you have whatever broken legend/x/x/x combo
    Hard agree, the IVs part of the stat system should have been left at the soul infusions and not another hidden stat tacked on under the hood. Thank fuck there arent EVs, although I guess condensing and souls are tantamount
It's missing the rpg element by quite a bit though. At the moment it's just a big sandbox survival.
Ark had an amazing concept but the devs fucked it up and the game had a lot of inconsistency‚Äôs that weren‚Äôt fixed until too late
There are IVs in palworld
    Yes, and they're saying Palworld didn't improve on it.
Really? Palworld improves on pokemon turn based monster battle? Cause I haven‚Äôt seen anything like that in palworld
    I would hardly say turn based combat is a unique experience for pokemon, not at all what I think of when I say 'the pokemon formula'
Not at all, I don‚Äôt see any evolutionary or shiny pals nowhere, I don‚Äôt see a good story anywhere here, the games are separate experiences and should be treated as such
    I think the vast majority would disagree just because they dont evolve or come in a slightly different shade of purple... the overlap in core game mechanics is quite enough to justify a comparison
The way you used ‚ÄúIV‚Äù bothers me despite it being cunning. Take a upvote

Edit: I forgot to say leave my presence.
    What about it bothers you? I didnt use it as a replacment for 'for'. It stands for Initial Value, which is a hidden boost to base stats and a breeding mechanic that exists in both pokemon and palworld. Historically it has been a pain in the ass to find out what these values are for newly hatched pokemon, but recently they have made it incredibly accessible. If palworld wants to keep the system, I think its best to make them visible to players without the use of calculators or mods
        Double entendres

        This is the first time I‚Äôm seeing my comment not show because of an edited post. That‚Äôs actually weird lol.
Something about your use of the Roman numerals there ticked me off... and i hate you... but since i don't wanna seem like a bad guy I'm gonna express that using an anime girl meme so i come off as a fellow degenerate

https://preview.redd.it/q2gkxbbaf6jc1.jpeg?width=732&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=29b1298cb05d69365f319a6a747e2361c44a6c06
    There are no roman numerals in their comment. There's Individual Value (IV) breeding.
    IV breeding? That's just the font. He's talking about breeding IVs, what Roman numerals are you talking about?
        IV =4 used for "for" in this context. I don't understand what you mean by font...
            IV is Roman numeral 4, yes, but he's talking about "Individual Values" or IVs.
                ...

I would have literally never figured that out without help... and yet... i STILL don't know what that means. The individual value thing...

https://preview.redd.it/mspi5hpkh6jc1.png?width=1169&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=93b4123c55ee9d8e688154581c216a84e684fc5d
                    Pokemon define their stats by base stats + IVs. IVs are stats that are added to the pokemon each level depending on what kind of pokemon you have battled and gained exp from. Some pokemon will give you attack, some defence and some speed etc.. When you breed two pokemon the offspring will have bonuses depending on the parents' IV, I don't know exactly how that works mechanically but that's what "IV Breeding" means
                        Damn. I never knew this a thing. Thanks for teaching me about it. ![img](emote|t5_4jn9v4|49342)
                    Individual Values means that every Pokemon and Pal has a range of stats it can have.  
  
Not every Grizzbolt will have the same HP, Atk, and Def even if they have the same passives.
As a pokemon fan I can confirm, palworld is what legends arceus should have been, sure it has glitches, sure the pal base AI is a bit doo doo asscheeks, but it's in early access. The graphics are many leagues above too, sure it was on a switch and this one on PC but look at the zelda open worlds, they look just a bit worse. So in conclusion if P: LA is Daniel, then Palworld is the cooler Daniel
    Damnnn, Daniel
I really hope it motivates Gamefreak to innovate.  They have the biggest IP in the entire world and haven't had a single innovation in nearly 30 years.  Seriously, what's really changed with Pokemon now vs 30 years ago? Color? 3D? Different types of evolution?
    Part of the problem is Pokemon is owned by 3 companies, Gamefreak, Nintendo, and the Pokemon Company. I doubt all three heads of Cerberus can agree on a new direction when theyve grown so fat on what they do.
        Nintendo wants the game squeaky clean because they have always put themselves first and foremost as a family company. 

Gamefreak wants consistency and money, so no innovation.

And PC barely knows how to code a game to begin with.
            > Nintendo wants the game squeaky clean because they have always put themselves first and foremost as a family company. 

Well, most of the time anyway. For Bayonetta 2 the Link costume originally [had no cleavage at all](https://www.siliconera.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/cho_009.jpg), because Platinum Games was worried about exactly that squeaky clean attitude. However, when they took the designs of the Link, Peach, and Samus costumes to Nintendo for approval Nintendo [asked them to add cleavage to the Link outfit](https://www.siliconera.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/20141024_014750.png).
    Game freak rakes in massive profits and continues to sell more games than anyone churning out the same crap. They have no incentive to invest in something like this, their current formula prints money.
Eh, I loved palworlds and it was amazing, but it‚Äôs certainly not what I wanted my whole life as a Pokemon fan. I think the more hardcore fans that are in to competitive and nuzlocking and the sort don‚Äôt really care for combat, stats, or really anything besides the collection portion of the game. The survival, building, and collection aspects are what I loved about it, the Pokemon aspects not so much, very different games and reasons for enjoyment
    You realize that there are ton of pokemon fans, competitive types are a minority of the actual players.
        ‚ÄúThis is what every Pokemon fan has ever wanted‚Äù and I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true, even not on an exaggerated level. I think there are a lot of fans of the game that aren‚Äôt just in it for collecting the Dex. Was just giving the more hardcore community a shout because they DEFINITELY wouldn‚Äôt compare it, and there‚Äôs thousands upon thousands of those people, so it‚Äôs really not that small of a group. Have quite a few friends that just play the mainline games once or twice and don‚Äôt get too into it and even they agree it‚Äôs really not all that similar.
            That last group you mentioned is most likely the biggest part of the Pok√©mon audience. Those that play the games a bit maybe finish the main story.
                Yeah completely agree. It‚Äôs a smaller percent of people sure, but we generally play the games dozens of times through in different ways or have much much longer playthroughs. It‚Äôs also a much higher percent of people playing it year long instead of when the game releases or every few years when they have the urge to
                    Which is why palworld is exciting because it's an evolving world. It's not locked in place. I can come back in 6 months and the game could have changed alot. If I come back to scarlet and violet i get to pay $30 bucks for a couple hours of new stuff. And then wait a year for the next $60 game drop
                        Yeah, I‚Äôm super excited for the future, 60 hours for a 30 dollar game is already worth it to me, I‚Äôm sure in the future, especially with modding, this will be a multi 100 hour game
            Yeah Palworld doesn't give me the same feeling at all. I'm not a competitive player by any means but sometimes come back to play some of the more challenging firered rom hacks. 

The main problem with the Pokemon main series for me is the difficulty. You only really scratch the surface of the combat mechanics because the game is so easy. 

Another one is content. They had some neat mechanics like the Pokemon contests. Wish they would extend on stuff like that.
    So the majority of longtime Pmon fans myself included agree with the previous statement lol, you don't speak for us in any way, shape, or form. And the competitive circuit is It's own community, most people don't want lumped in with the min-max crowd bc they suck all the fun out of literally everything lol
        It‚Äôs not just competitive min maxers, it‚Äôs nuzlockers, challenge runners, shiny hunters and several other categories. I never claimed it wasn‚Äôt majority, I just think saying it‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs or even almost everyone‚Äôs is just wrong, probably 70% or so would agree, but a lot of people see very little similarities between the two besides ‚Äúcollective monster in ball‚Äù. There really isn‚Äôt much strategy involved with the game and that‚Äôs a huge part of Pokemon for A LOT of people. Disregarding huge portion of the community (even if not the majority, there‚Äôs still A LOT of people that are in one of these groups)
            They're not meant to be compared directly lol, see this is why people say yall suck the fun out of everything. There's plenty of strategy in it's own right. Choosing the right pals/techniques for an encounter makes it much easier, is that not strategy to you? Just bc you can do more in the moment than stand around giving commands doesn't mean it's not strategic. And nuzlockers would live it. I'm doing a no catch run rn where I'm going through the journey without crafting or using a single sphere. Shiny hunters would enjoy the hunts for lucky and Alt types, and I'd love to hear about these other categories bc it sounds like you're just moving goalposts for the sake of not being wrong.
                ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not meant to be compared directly‚Äù

Ok so I‚Äôm right and it‚Äôs not what we‚Äôve been waiting for this whole time lol, if they aren‚Äôt comparable than it‚Äôs not what we waited for it
                    No you're just deluded and think you speak for the community as a whole, which your ass backwards opinions contradict. I don't know a single pokemon fan that isn't absolutely insufferable as a human being that doesn't think this game is cool. You can be triggered all you want but yes the majority of Pmon fans think palworld is awesome lol.
                        I‚Äôve literally said multiple times I don‚Äôt speak for the majority? Just a large group of people lol, just stop, I‚Äôm not responding anymore to this needless agression
lol. lmao even
Is it? I thought Pok√©mon fans wanted an actual JRPG instead of a mediocre survival game with a Pok√©mon gimmick slapped on top of it. I just don't see how this game has anything to do with Pok√©mon once the honeymoon period of monster collection fades away.
You guys wanted a survival craft game? My brother, you did not have to wait all these years.
everyone who likes Pokemon has been saying the same thing and its damn true
    Not me.
        I think Pokemon Violet was a lot like Palworld. Because  once I got to the part you are supposed to walk up the hill to school, I just explored the entire map climbing mountains and catching Pals instead.
Pokemon is never gonna rehash itself to be an entirely different genre. It would be silly. Palworld is ARK with pokemon and that's it, expecting pokemon to drop its entire battle system and genre(which is a global esport with monetary prizes btw) to chase a new genre is absurd and would alienate its audience.

No one who actually grew up with pokemon wants palworld as the future. Even romhack makers don't make stuff like palworld, they create rpgs with pokemon. That's what they always have been. I'm glad you Teo enjoy palworld, but to say pokemon should've made a game like palworld is so disconnected from what pokemon actually is.

I've seen this sentiment lot of people wishing pokemon would be like palworld and the reality is no it shouldn't be.  Pokemon is nearly 30 years, growing every year, catching new generations of fans and keeping plenty of old ones doing what they do. Can there be a survival game spinoff? Sure but that's not pokemon, that's a survival game with pokemon and frankly I think the idea of automation via pokemon slaves would be pretty shitty world building wise.

Is it formulaic? Yes. But that's why pokemon works. I'd rather pokemon keeps IMPROVING at what they do, and not lose their identity. No other major player does what pokemon does in gaming. And yea the games need better performance and more story, they absolutely have room to grow, WITHIN their field.

Anyone saying Palworld is the kind of game pokemon should have made is detached from what pokemon really is and has their own mental canon of what it could be. We don't need "pokemon for adults". Pokemon is for everyone. In the same way that disney movies are for everyone.
    Theres people who played pokemon r/b/y/g/s and stopped. Being a pokemon fan doesnt mean youve purchased/played every game in the franchise. This game works well for people who only played gen 1/2 pokemon and happen to like survival games too. Ask someone if they enjoyed valheim, ask if they played pokemon red/blue. If the answer is yes to both theyll enjoy palworld.
        What part of RGBY would match palworld? If anything people who played the more modern games that actually are open world (legends arceus and SV) are more likely to enjoy palworld if only because the open world design similarity. A thin connection but a bigger one than saying "oh you played pokemon 25 years ago? You'll love this survival game where you collect monsters." There have been plenty of monster collector games since, it takes more than catching monsters to be a good game.

It's disingenuous to conflate pokemon gameplay to palworld and i really don't think there's any connection. Hell my palworld friend actively does not like pokemon and never has and he loves palworld, because they're not the same.
            You‚Äôve got such a rage boner that you‚Äôre conflating everything i‚Äôve said. I‚Äôm done talking at you, if you want discourse i‚Äôll come back later when you‚Äôve had your juice box and chill out.
Pokemon could easily take inspiration from other games to make different genres too. Like a pokemon cozy farming game would be amazing. Like rune factory or even what palworld does on a surface level.

I enjoyed the turn base RPG of Arceus - it was fast paced and kept me engaged. But it was basically it's only mechanic so the game got old for me much faster than palworld. I'm about 100 hours in on Palworld and I only did about 20 hours on Arceus.

One game was $60 and the other was $30. I think Gamefreak has an unreasonable release schedule, but as long as 20 million people buy their games full price every year they have no reason to change anything.

Even with palworld being a success they again have no reason to change anything because fans will still buy their games.

Until sales take a downward turn they aren't going to budge.
Evolving pals just lowers the amount of useful pals in the game, same as pokemon.¬†
To me, I explain to pokemon players that Palworld is what I had hoped Pokemon Arceus would be like
I love riding with Zoe & Grizzbolt! ü§™
They are very different games. They are very similar brands/IPs. The majority of people who play Pok√©mon play it because if the IP and aren‚Äôt particularly attached to the gameplay. If a Pok√©mon fan is dissatisfied with the quality or diversity of gameplay, which is a *lot*, this is an excellent choice.
they are different, but as someone who primarily plays Pok√©mon, it was enough to make me want to play this game. I also really liked cassette beasts. I think it‚Äôs got potential be a genre that really only Pok√©mon occupied before.
Out of curiosity what games would you recommend?
    Conan exiles and Ark are the big ones I‚Äôd assume
        Grounded too!
The theme is pokemon-esque (which is really just monster catching) but the gameplay is still Ark/Conan.

I loved the concept of Ark but raising an army of dodos and spitters over 2 days to eventually whittle down and capture a raptor got old quick when it took 2 days to get to the taming the raptor only to die a stupid death and have it lost to the map. Then try and find another, succeed in taming, get mobbed *and it's gone*. 

Then I didn't play for a day and my dodos all died of hunger. Then I jumped in my friend's server and saw a 30 day timer for for a brachiosaurus, and noped right out.

Ark was amazing, but it took the survival stuff to the extreme and turned it into a job. Palworld has all the accessibility Ark lacked (I only played the first at launch so no idea if it changed).
Which is also why this is a flash in the pan. Pokemons longevity stems from its designs and the comfort of its systems. It might get samey for people after 30 years but it's a continuous guarantee of what you're gonna get and that keeps people coming back when they have that itch. It also has much larger audience as a brand. Card game players, merch collectors, anime enjoyers.

But they always stay for the merch and designs, and that has staying power. Palworld doesn't have that. It's a survival game and while a good one, it's not really a name worth remembering in a year or 5 years. The Pals by and large are forgettable, and the aesthetic of the game is very much  a unity asset store vomit outside of the pals (which themselves are mostly model redesigns of existing pokemon)

It's new gameplay with pokemon at home and once that wears itself out people will move on. Which is a shame cause if palworld had been more unique and focused on its brand it could have grown, but this was a small company and it's not exactly easy to make a successful monster series.

What was closest? Neopets? Even that died in time. The actual successful series are under big corporate umbrellas. Pokemon has nintendo,  digimon has toei/Bandai. Yokai watch has also decline but it too was heavily under nintendo umbrella as their publisher. Its not cheap to create dozens of monsters that have lasting appeal and a world building skill to match
>Is don‚Äôt like ark and I don‚Äôt know what Conan exiles is

So, picture ARK, but with two main changes:

1. Instead of being mostly on tropical/subtropical islands, it's set predominantly in an Iron Age desert (also features some jungles, arctic wastes, and a volcano, but the desert region is both central and ***big***).
2. Instead of fighting and taming dinosaurs, you're primarily fighting cannibals, bandits, and slavers, and are yourself enslaving them (there's still animal taming, but it takes a backseat to the slavery).

...actually, a third important change, too. You can climb up walls like you can in Palworld and Breath of the Wild. I *think* Conan: Exiles might actually have been the first big game to do that, but I'm not certain.
Yup that is in fact valid criticism, in a sense that the game appeals more to the   
1) survival - basebuilding - creativity - exploring formula  
2) gotta catch em' all addictiveness  
3) looting and leveling game-loop (obtain stuff to obtain more/other stuff to obtain more/other stuff etc) 

Personally, 1) doesn't catch me as much as others, I barely decorate as the stuff costs research points that I rather spent on stuff that "does something". However, totally fell for the 2) Paldeck and had to explore and catch everything there was, long before the level of my character/ game would  have me leave the early areas. 3) never really hurts, could've done with less, wouldn't mind more.

The boss towers and I suppose end of the game (the island with the tree..?) were afterthoughts for me, didn't care at all (100hours in and only did 2 towers, haven'g gone to the big tree) but I absolutely see how this type of open world would not work for let's say pokemon players that rather have a narrative and prefer a straight path to progress along
    The game has everything but doesn't shine in anything

Base building is barebones, farming/pet management simulator is barebones too

Figts need balancing

Story non existent

The game is absolutely worth the money, but it has very big room for growth
        Yep. I‚Äôd also argue the tower bosses are‚Ä¶ just there. Even the lowest level boss with Grizzbolt? Is way harder than the content around it. 

The other bosses except maybe Lily are super tough. 

We need to bring the tower bosses into lore other than the logs, because they are kinda just there. Optional content as such.
            The lore, loosely from what I‚Äôve gathered, is that the island used to be ruled by the legends. People and pals lived in harmony. The tower bosses are the leaders of the various groups that changed the landscape by outcasting the legends and humans alike and taking power for themselves. This is why there‚Äôs relatively few unallied humans and the legends live off in their little corners.
    Just FYI you can't make it to the big tree without glitching around the skybox.
    I hope they can change the research point system. I wasted so many points on early items because at that point you could afford everything. Now in the tail end of the game I have to hunt down manuals to unlock what I really want to use.
I don't believe the majority of players need a path to follow given how many sandbox games are extremely successful.
    Which? The major souls-likes  have a story. Zelda and Skyrim have side quests. Minecraft is probably the one exception.
        7 days to die  
Terraria  
Factorio  
Rimworld  
Ark (mostly)  
Mount & Blade  
Valheim  
Enshrouded
        None of those games are survival sandboxes.

Survivals sole point is you‚Äôre gonna need to explore if you want to survive/progress.

It‚Äôs a genre that really doesn‚Äôt need heavy story elements other than explaining why you‚Äôre in this mess.
        Minecraft, Roblox, Fortnite, GTA, Ark, etc.
There is some story with the adventurer logs and stuff. Also build your own story based on what you see. There is a reason why there isn't a path to follow.  It's a sandbox game
    Calling the adventurer logs a story is a joke and you know it
        I wouldn't call it a story, more of background information and observations on pals, the world and the various bosses.
        Yeah I like the game but thats kinda cope
    It's like subnautica in a sense
I think story will come after. These journals we find scattered across the map hint at a bigger picture that we dont see yet, or simply havent got access to. We are told that these powers generate some form of energy and need to be protected.
Yeh the game feels 60% complete which is what the creators have said


I got bored mid game. The gameplay loop got stale real fast once the initial base building and fun levelling was had trying to fill my paldex of pals


Its not fun capturing 10 of each just to get earn big XP. Its extremely repetitive and feels like a chore. Theres not many other ways to earn enough XP to level up for the end game content like defeating the final boss towers or capturing the legendary pals. 


Im stuck in the mid game with a horrendous grind


Dungeons are just a copy and paste job in each area. No interesting POI's for exploration. No random interactions during exploation that are fun. The little villages are a bit of a joke in that at best they have a pal trader and a standard merchant and thats it
As someone who knows nothing about share market and business, cant a company just remain on a shop like level with one guy owning it with hundreds of employee ? Does it always need to be turned into shares type model if it grows successful and large ?
    If they want investments from others rather than using their own money, yes. It's not "required" but most companies that want growth see it as a faster and cheaper way to go about it.
        Not the only way. They could leverage, they could sell minority ownership to one person to retain control, and they can use the profits to grow. Speaking as a business owner, incorporating is NOT even close to the only option.
    It can, see Valve for an example of a company staying private.

But it can be difficult to get serious amounts of investment money into your company without the prospect of turning into a public share model company.
    There's plenty of large private companies but private investment is generally more expensive than public. And much less liquid
        Not to mention that large private companies tend to have less media coverage precisely because there's not as much public interest in their performance.

    If you have investors. They want a higher bottom line every quarter or there will be changes. It honestly kills a lot of games. And I don't know if this is true.. but I heard in the US if you knowingly do something that will cause that bottom line to shrink... Even if it's good for the long-term of the company you can be outed from the company.
This isnt capitalism this is if anything this comes from confuscionism and arguably socialism. As this sentiment that games always need to be played year round comes from the gaming markets in countries like china and s.korea, where games that can be played year round day in day out are hyper profitable. This is becuase those two ideologies have created societies in which a huge % young men at the bottom have no chance of bettering their lives romantically or economically, so they can afford to and have the time to literally game all the time. Western devs have seen this and are now trying to take adv on western economic downturn aswell.
Your first paragraph is so far off base‚Ä¶ just shows how many uninformed people there are out there.
Oh no, 9th place, and 4th place for games that cost money.

What's funny is that 1st through 8th are all live service games. I mean, unless you think people aren't buying GTA V for GTA Online.

Edit: They just announced a raid and have been fixing bugs since launch. I think they'll be fine, barring the CEO of Pocket Pair picking up a cocaine addiction or them never leaving early access like craftopia.
Yeah I was mostly referring to the mindless consoomers and dumbasses in general talking about player count it's always all about the money with business
Doubtful, it‚Äôs a fad game. I‚Äôm impressed it got so high by just milking the pokemon similarities. Literally Arc with pokemon nothing new or creative. Game will keep falling because people have already played this game with a different skin.
It has decreased in player count week over week every day since release. 

It has retained less than 5% of its player base.
    Just like any other non-live service game? Like wtf are you even saying?

How many people are playing The Witcher 2 right now???!
        Elden ring did not lose 95% of its player base in a month. Neither did baldurs gate.

I am not even going to respond to your attempt at a comparison because it is utterly asinine and ridiculous.
At least a way to keep you entertained. Now there's literally nothing to do.
    Nothing to do and nothing *you want* to do are different.
        Mr condenser over here
            I mean, it's something to do.
                Tis true. Y'all have fun with that king
    So‚Ä¶ play a new game‚Ä¶ Jesus

Exactly what I did. Every time a portion of the game got boring, too grindy or tedious, I changed the settings, used We Mod or downloaded mods to go through it faster.

Breeding is the best example. I made a maxed out Anubis with LV 5 handiwork. That took forever and wasn't interested in doing that again with other pals so I downloaded a mod to make eggs instantly and one where I only need 1 pal per level to condense.
    Ooo that‚Äôs a really fantastic idea! I don‚Äôt mind some grinding but breeding is so tedious. I‚Äôve never used mods before but I also heard there‚Äôs one that lets you share items in boxes between bases so maybe I‚Äôll start looking into that :)
        Hopefully they're paying attention to mod creation and traction, then integrate the most popular mods into game mechanics.

Like, say, you're happy with your second/third base placement and you want to share resources. Now you have to lay down a rail or pipe system between bases to enable that. Takes time to build and gets attacked as you're building, but once built is safe and makes all materials available.

Or maybe it's never safe from attack and another building near the transfer tiles in the tech tree opens up a command and conquer style game play where you send in pals from the box to counter attack.

Breeding seems to have the most complaints. Create a nursery pal or two that ups high IV odds / makes attaining the perks you want easier. Could adjust them so the benefits from them grow as you breed/capture stronger pals.
    I'm playing the game on hard mode... But I think I'll have dedicated breeding days where I turn it to easy. Because ain't no way I'm waiting days for breeding.

The fact the timers stop the moment you exit the game is insane to me.... Having to play 20+ hours for a large egg.. absurd.

Nothing else grindy bothers me though. I'm happy to not rush through the game like most people, having nothing left to do in game.

Plus, I'm thinking, if you rush to overpowered pals.. then all of the games challenge is Really eliminated. It's not like there's pvp yet. You're just gonna be blasting through bosses and to collecting things, and repeat.

 Now That can get Boring!
        Well as long as people had fun playing at the pace they did it's good. I definitely did the end game stuff faster than most would, but I had fun. Anyways I still have things to do
        Huh? Is that a single player thing? I'm on a server, and the egg timers keep going when you log off. Having to actually wait 20 hours in game is terrible
            Yup. It's cause servers run all the time
I‚Äôm preconditioned to believe if I change any settings from normal I will not get achievements‚Ä¶ and meaningless computer awards are more important than streamlining the game to my available time. I see your logic and I will take it under consideration.
Most casual players are not going to them know where that setting is
Honestly the building sucks ass also they need to add more building freedom when it comes to things clipping into each other like imagine building a nice looking roof without it looking ugly or slowing us to clip those triangles into the sides of stairs or leting us clip 2 walls into eachother for an X shape anything the only thing would be rules about crafting stations


In short just br more lenient about objects clipping into other objects to make it easier to make things look nice
Yeah a story would be great not just lore. It beats Pokemon out in graphics and I guess bugs not being everywhere. Everything else not really. PVP will probably be just shooting, since the pals are AI controlled, there no story. Just lore in books.
I mean yeah have you seen how effective Hitachi's are?
They didn't really "go back to the old formula" with Scarlet/ Violet, they were both in development at the same time¬† by different teams. The next generation of pokemon games is when we will actually see what they took away from their experiments with Arceus and if it will change their core approach to the series.
Agreed but pokemon is still falling and will probably still get more games but I just think that at this point alot of fans will stay back the only problem is people will still buy it and play it for a few days or a week or 2 at most. people complain about pokemon being bad alot anymore but if it's so bad then don't buy it it's probably due to hype or just high expectations for a company that really only cares about money anymore and how many people buy it
    > Agreed but pokemon is still falling

Pokemon on the Switch has sold the most copies of any games in the franchise sans Red and Blue
    ¬†"pokemon is still falling"

This is what being terminally online does to a motherfucker lmao.
        Yeah, you can dislike Pokemon since you 'outgrown it' but to say it falling off is stupid. It a household name nobody really knows palworld except for gamers.
The ark style game has been replicated many many times only difference is ark actually keeps improving after they get paid, palworlds devs or what ever u call them have a bad history of letting games die sooo we will see. Nintendo just is stale and honestly the Zelda games r the only games I consider AAA even digital Pok√©mon is a small fan base considering. Palworld hit a sweet spot with it being fun for everyone they would be dumb not to keep it alive
Well, OK overhaul mod manages to change textures based on traits and stuff, so that's already some ways into it XD
Or he want to do nasty things..........
More importantly, seeing tour pal destroy the pal you wanted to catch. There should be some weaken option for your pals instead of kill or not kill, so they auto stop
    Kinda like false swipe right?
I did say this game is worth the money, and i have 100 hours in it.
Yes. The monster catching + base building mechanic does make the game addicted.
I was so sad when I hit the red wall üò¢

I had a good thirty seconds of denial. I was like "maybe I just need to come from a different angle"

Then I finally accepted the truth that I would not get to the tree
    You can go "over" the red wall but then there's another invisible barrier thats a bit closer to the tree
        Fun fact. Technically its not an other invisible barrier, its the collision of the tree.
The fect that pocket pair uses unreal engine 5.1 for palworld and the default collision for a imported model is a  "simple"  collision  what that does is it is looking at the form of the model and than make a collision barrier around the full model fromfrom top to bottom.
But it the gonna set the collision to " use  complex collision" it would look at the model and based on the polygons of the model its would be the same for the collision.
So its really just the model collision and not a invisible barrier 

But i think the devs didn't predict that the players still could find a way to go over it. 

Still a good place to make a farming base as i did  its mostly flat and no other pals or raids comming there
    I, too, tried to go around it. For a good minute I went along the red wall, hoping there would be a way in‚Ä¶
I will never forget the sound in my friends voice when I told him he was not going to reach the tree, about 3 seconds before he hit the wall.
Praise the Erdtree
There is hint In the opening scene something will be done with that tree
There's been talk that the portion available to us is part of a big chain of islands surrounding the big tree in the distance. Could possibly up the level cap, and introduce new islands with new pals that way
    On that note the devs said they‚Äôre planning for 4 major releases, which would correspond to the 3 other corners and the island of the big tree itself
        Hope one of those updates includes a huge underground system
    They have already stated new Islands would be coming
    The big tree concept sounds super intriguing, like it could be a central hub connecting these islands, and maybe each island has its own unique ecosystem? That'd keep things fresh and give a reason to explore, more than just a level cap incentive. Plus, imagine if each new island came with its own set of challenges or environmental hazards to survive.
        That's what I'm hoping, something different environmentally as well as the pals that'll spawn

Considering what they put out to start with, I do have hope they could give us something exciting with new islands and such
        >That'd keep things fresh

So what you're saying is that right now we are in Kanto, soon there will be Johto and eventually Hoenn, Sinnoh, Unova and (checks notes...) _Paldea_.
According to game code, level isn't hard capped until 80 but it's currently blocked at 50. So there is at least a plan to go to 80 at the moment.
    At 10 level increments. Primary release to 50. 3 expansion releases at 10 levels a piece.
        Would make sense too, I really don‚Äôt see the next update suddenly adding lvl 80 pals (and the next updates 100/140)
        In a year or 2 mabye
    I feel like they need to add more requirements for leveling after 50 too. Like to get to 60 you need xp and a certain amount of your paldex filled out or something just to make it a little harder to max out
I'd rather that be changed into water focused zone, but everything else I agree with.  


I'd like to have to ride a pal with "surf" in order to get out there and then use a pal with "dive" in order to breach the water and explore and catch deep sea pals.
    I get what you‚Äôre saying but flying mounts kind of make that unnecessary. I still would like them to add that kind of stuff as an option. Underwater areas would be so cool. They could even add scuba gear.
        There are possible lore accurate ways to prevent flying in certain places to make use of other kinds of mechanics
            I think that would be a bad move personally
                Don't want caves or underwater bioms?
                    I do but I still want the option to fly over water. Maybe I misunderstood
            Tbh they should just make your flying pal go back into its ball if they ‚Äúland‚Äù over water while mounted in order to make water pals more useful
                Not from just landing on water, but maybe if they run out of stamina and fall onto water.
        Eh, the way the stamina system works with flying mounts, it's more efficient to just take a water mount that doesn't drain stam when in the water for long ocean trips, then switch once you make landfall, rather than starting out with a flyer and having to take frequent rest stops
        If there's a water mount that surfs faster than flying mounts then they would be viable
        Flying mounts do make you descend every once in a while which is kind of annoying and a different experience than a water mount, which I'd definitely like.
You can "get" to the tree and go past the wall, but there's nothing there. It's currently set dressing.

But that tree is definitely important. All the skill fruits grow on trees seemingly made of paldium. All the dungeon final rooms have a larger tree that is similar to the skill fruit trees.

I have a feeling that big tree is the source of the paldium, the origin of the pals, and likely will be the finale of the planned updates.
    I think it even says as much in the journals or in some of the item flavor text. Something about the energy from the tree making palladium and it's carried through the water which is why all the small palladium rocks spawn by oceans/rivers
        Great, there goes who knows how many hours searching out the journals.
Being pre release they can easily work on density as well as expanding.

The map is beautiful,  just lacking in content and story in it.  Even just bumping the spawn rate to 3x makes the world feel so much more alive.
There was a rumor that the giant tree would become the true center of a bigger map and your be able to select which region around the tree you'd wanna spawn
    this would be very cool
sadly wildcard bit more than they could chew and it blew up in their faces
    wildcard made truly awful decisions one after another even after getting bailed out numerous times. im expecting ark 2 to be some kind of singleplayer only game, or at least heavily narrative based. it just seems so odd to me they're spending all this time making ARK: SA when ARK 2 is supposedly coming out this year. they're gonna have two competing games in the same franchise confusing new players. why they wouldn't just keep making ARK 2 until it's done I don't know, maybe they desperately needed a cash infusion or maybe I'm right and it's not gonna be a pvp survivalcraft at all.
        Because a huge percentage of the ark player base has absolutely zero interest in a third person only arksouls conan evolved game. People just wanted ark to work properly and be playable. Unfortunately ASA is the same turd as ASE except this turd has been rolled in glitter.
            i mean, tons of people play ark in third person. i'm not making any definitive assumptions on gameplay until we see gameplay footage or their marketing ramps up.
        Well, ARK 2 is going to be nothing like ARK: SA, ARK 2 is a souls like narrative driven game and will be almost an entirely different game from ARK: SA, the only thing that will link ARK 2 to the original ARKs will be the lore and dinosaurs

The reason they made ARK: SA was to please fans of ARK: SE Since most of us didn‚Äôt want a souls like version of ARK, we wanted regular ARK
            Are you sure about that? I don't think they ever said anywhere ARK 2 *wouldn't* be survival craft, but they said it would have more soulsy on-foot combat, which doesn't mean a survival craft is dead. But idk.
                Well im sure its gonna still have survival crafting, but last I checked they were focusing on 3rd person souls like exploration/combat which is absolutely different than what we have in ARK:SE/A Which is unique
Also, Microsoft will be bankrolling them. They want this to become their Mario/Poke/GOW
    Indoubtedly
100 / 200
They already have 14 programmers and 5 game designers, for reference.
Totally agree. Pokemon games only ever touch on the dark side through pokedex entries or text. You almost never really see the brutal side of a pokemon world.
    This is why I loved Legends Arceus so much, it started dipping its toes into the darker side, like the casual mention of Pokemon wanting to murder you. But then they threw that away with scarlet and violet, and Legends only just barely dipped its toes in. Palworld just dove head first into the darkness
        Doesn‚Äôt Palworld‚Äôs reminds you quite a bit of arceus? It definitely made me go hmmmmm
            Literally the only relation it has is that it's cute creatures caught in balls and it's open world. Totally different concept otherwise if you ask me. The similarities are numerous but it's really not as similar as alot of people say. (I'll admit I've accidentally called some pals by the Pokemon they look similar to
Such a good way of putting it
Honestly its pretty fucking boring without greater control over your pals who cant be mounted. I'm not really excited for pvp until combat is improved from a competetive standpoint.

In terms of fulfilling a monster-tamer fantasy? It meets the mark, and has a leg up on pokemon as you can use many many more monsters as mounts, and even mounted combat
I think simply adding a 4th move and the option to select which move they use via the radial wheel where you pet and choose aggro would do wonders for this. I'd be kind of surprised if they're not working in the ai, though considering that's a huge complaint of the community and pocket pair seems to listen well.
    I personally wouldn‚Äôt even necessarily be frustrated with them if they couldn‚Äôt fix it. It would go a long way toward making the game a better experience but npc AI seems to be something even AAA studios struggle with sometimes. 

I don‚Äôt know what all they‚Äôre working with, but if they keep putting out content and fixing what they can I‚Äôll be coming back. That just happens to be the biggest item on my wishlist.
>How do you feel about the pal vs pal combat out of curiosity?

honestly its pretty bad right now, The bigger pals are janky as fuck, and their moves are even more janky. The AI is also pretty bad. Hopefully it gets fixed in the future
All I ever did in conan was tame animals and use them for all my combat anyway haha
When my level 25 tanzie is fighting a mammoth, there is definitely strategy. Lol
Pokemon hasn't evolved that formula in 20 years. All it took was a team to make the pokemon game people wanted from Nintendo for years and it sold like wildfire.
    I love Pal world. They did a lot of great things.

What they did not do is deliver a strategy game; and pokemon very much is. Lots of mind games with the team you bring to a rank match, because you don‚Äôt use all of them; the switches you make mid battle to try to gain a type advantage; the move selection you choose and the type coverage it offers.

And I will **always** prefer evolutions on my creature collectors. I don‚Äôt really like having 2 pals that are clearly related. I don‚Äôt care about world building, I care about how I used my pengullet for 20 levels: I don‚Äôt want to capture a new penking, I want my pengullet to evolve

Palworld **changed** and then improved on Pok√©mon. I still want the open world ‚Äúpokemon‚Äù game too. I‚Äôm greedy sure; but I know Nintendo is too

Edit: ‚Äútiming‚Äù does not equal ‚Äústrategy‚Äù. palworld has zero strategy involved. It‚Äôs an action game where we can use actions to time switches to gain a benefit. But there is no ‚Äúshould I try to dodge, or should I face tank it‚Äù. You should try to dodge.

Double edit: I forgot this sub is full of children who have to go ‚ÄúAcTuAlY‚Äù to every little thing. Thank you for giving me the push to leave the sub
        If you try facing enemy's 5 levels above you, strategy, assigned attacks and subbing out are very much a thing as your guns do literally 9-11 damage per hit. I'm not to fussed on evolutions myself, as most are unique enough to not seem related in the way you draw lines between pokemon lineage.
            Pulling Pals defensively to avoid attacks is also something to be mindful of during a fight.
            I would claim that ‚ÄúSubbing‚Äù in this game is not a ‚Äústrategy‚Äù. All you think is ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to get hit better recall my pal‚Äù. It‚Äôs a test of your timing skill, not your critical thinking skill

While Subbing in pokemon is deciding to give your opponent an immediate benefit, so that you can gain a future benefit; that is strategy
                Eh, it's still boiling back to live vs turn based, in a live pokemon battle you also wouldn't have time to map a strategy like you do in turnbased, it's tennis vs chess.

Edit: not sure why you blocked me after last reply but OK lol
                    
Then open world pokemon game will still be turn based, just like Arcues/Scarlet/violet‚Ä¶what‚Äôs your point?

Edit: I blocked them for continuing to change what I am trying to talk about and ignoring what I was saying‚Ä¶.this wasn‚Äôt a discussion it was the other user talking at me.

Edit for the person below; I hope you get the help you need friend ‚ù§Ô∏è
        Turn based combat is a very heavy mechanic in pokemon, but I dont really see it as a defining feature at all and is incredibly boring and dated imho
            bro turn based combat is like, a hallmark of many s-tier rpg's lol. that's like saying fps is boring and dated because its a heavy mechanic in doom/wolfenstein. (for the record i'm not dissing you for disliking turn based combat, i see what you're getting at)
                I don't think they were saying that turn-based combat ***in general*** is boring and dated, but rather that ***Pokemon's*** turn-based combat is boring and dated... which is accurate, IMO. They really haven't changed it all that much from the original Pokemon games.
                    Mmm fair point lol. Pokemon‚Äôs rigid formula is incredibly stale and I haven‚Äôt fully played through one since sword/shield, which i found exceedingly disappointing
                    Because it's a solid system and doesn't have to change. If you e played competitive pokemon you'll see that pokemons turn based gameplay is actually very intense, turn by turn reads and plays are wild. If you're into chess and card games, competitive pokemon would be right up your alley. 

What the games need are better stories, better AI, and higher difficulty. And even then, the latest DLC actually gave us an entire zone where every battle was a double battle with the NPCs using real items and strats, they're getting there finally.
            Turn based combat as a whole will never be ‚Äúdated‚Äù what are you smoking? 

People care about their joints; we can‚Äôt just play button smashing action games all the time. That‚Äôs how you get carpal tunnel
                I don't mind turn based combat in abstract 2d games but with the modern 3d style of new pokemon games it's pathetic
                    Why?

Edit: *is it ‚Äúpathetic‚Äù*
            Lol there is a global level tournament for pokemon battling, it is the basis of how the card game works, it's what the anime is based on, it is the core gameplay system of the series for almost 30 years...


How is that NOT a defining feature? You can think it's boring and you're welcome to your opinion but it's a silly stance to take as truth. Is chess boring? Hasn't changed its gameplay in actual centuries yet it's still the most recognized boardgame/strategy game in the world? Is LoL boring for not having changed its gameplay in the 15 years since its release?

YOU might not care for it and that's a fine opinion to have, same as I don't care for shooters. But let's not live in our own mental canon where mainline pokemon games ARENT DEFINED by their turn based strategy elements. That's like saying main Mario games arent defined by their platforming elements. It's a silly take.

It's not boring, it's not dated. It's actually very intense, takes a lot of practice and game knowledge to be good at and has a rich strategic elements. Again you don't have to love it but calling it boring and dated is like calling chess boring and dated.
    "The game people wanted", no, think what you might like, most fans *don't* want something edgy or over the top like Palworld.
        You can deny it as long as you want, but the majority of people who bought it love pokemon and are keen to see the more adult pokemon world, meanwhile pokemon still tries to sanitise the whole enslaving creatures to cockfight aspect.
            Or majority bought it for the memes and don't engage in the vocal group that say "THIS IS WHAT POKEMON SHOULD BE LIKE"
                Like I said feel, free to deny it as long as you want
PalWorld isn‚Äôt like the Pok√©mon GAMES. PalWorld is like how the world of Pok√©mon is actually described by GameFreak and even the anime.
"Just shoot" is the same take as "Just press A" in turn-based games. 

Palworld has more skill expression than Pokemon, it just doesn't matter with the current game state because there's no reason to do it.
    More things in common with Pokemon in a way lol. There's lots of knowledge and skill expression in Pokemon that very few ever even touch because the base game doesn't challenge you enough.
Gigantic Pok√©mon fan here. Pok√©mon was never good because of the battle system. But for the team building and fun world. Palworld just improves that by alot
    Gigantic Pokemon fan here. Team building only matters because of the battle system. The fun world is only an additional part. You remove the battle system, and it stops feeling like Pokemon and just feels like chaos.

Palworld is entirely different because of this. There‚Äôs no strategy. You can actually return your Pals as a move is hitting them to prevent damage and then send them back out. Typings don‚Äôt matter cause any Pal can learn any type move and STAB is negligible compared to other passives.
        Eh. I've played multiple Pok√©mon games where I shot through with the same team for pretty much the entire game, ignoring the battle system.
            This is my beef with a lot of the newer Pokemon games tbh. Ever since they turned the exp share on permanently, you don‚Äôt really even have to try anymore for the most part. 

There are some good mods and stuff out there though where strategy is definitely still very important. And that does make for a much more engaging experience imo. 

I do love both Pokemon and Palworld but I agree that they give different vibes - at least when Pokemon is done right or is at a competitive level.
                You never really needed to use more than one pokemon. You could just overlevel one pokemon and then keep the rest as revive sacrifices.
        its better than pokemon just deal with it they did what hey should have done palsworld should partner with digimon for their first cosmetic drop
        That's the thing. Team building in palworld doesn't just revolve around the battling. You have to consider traversal, resource gathering and the environment and time of day. Not to mention the whole base team. If the battle system was the most important thing in Pok√©mon how come the anime, the card game, pokken, mystery dungeon, snap etc still feels like Pok√©mon

There is a lot of strategy. Tho the strategy is different. You have to think more on your feet. There isn't a pause to give you time to plan. Typings matter arguably more than in Pok√©mon because of the simplified type chart..
            There really isn't a lot of strategy. Game is piss easy, which isn't a bad thing, but you can go guns blazing and succeed more often than not lol



Half the stuff you listed is a bit of a reach. Traversal options don't require strategy. It boils down to use flier or use ground mount. Thats it. 


Hell, you can completely ignore type advantages and still win. It won't even be difficult.
        >Palworld is entirely different because of this. There‚Äôs no strategy.

Pokemons strategy is exclusively type countering, pokemon also has potions which completely negate using any strategy. Which is fine because the game is designed that way.

Theres a reason why every pokemon game, if you exclusively use your starter you will go through every bad type match up gym completely out leveling them. Not to mention types don't even matter when you can learn adjacent type abilities.
            This was basically my strat as a kid. Went through every generation up to platinum just using my starter to burst through everything. 

Strategy: grass type? Charizard. Flying type? Charizard water type? Charizard

Except Fire Red, where I was possessed by the rat spirit and went through the game with 2 Rattata that never evolved.
        So do you like Palworld still or not really. Genuine question.
        Well by that logic Pokemon has no strategy either. You can steamroll through with just one move ignoring type altogether as long as you level a single mon enough. And that's exactly how I played it when I was a kid
        I agree! By now I've played Palworld to level 45 with a bunch of friends, beating every single tower boss but Victor/Shadowbeak and capturing every single Alpha pal available. The combat system is fine for as long as shooting up bullets and rockets into pocket monsters seem funny to you. Gets boring really fast, specially if you're hoping to find any tactical approach. It all boils down to variance and design space.

It could be easily remedied by increasing the relevancy of Pal/move types and Unique Abilities. Something easily done and worked on given enough time to playtest and refine. 

For reference: 
ON POK√âMON Type advantage may go up to 4x or 400% move damage. 
Disadvantage may go down to 0.25x or 25% or even 0 (Type immunity)
STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) adds 50% of a move's power to its total power before calculation if it has the same typing as the user.

ON PALWORLD type advantage may go up to 1.4x or 140% move damage. That's 260% less upwards variance than pok√©mon.
Disadvantage goes down to 0.6x or 60% move damage. That's 45% less downwards variance than pok√©mon, 60% less if you consider the lack of immunity in Palworld. (although these numbers might not be precise, they might actually err to less)
STAB on Palworld also adds only 20% to a move's power before damage calc. (confirmed value) That's 30% less impactful than pok√©mon.

The result is a dumbed down version of the pok√©mon battle system requiring little care for choice and variance. Since its conception, pok√©mon gym leaders employ monotype team compositions SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED to give the player an edge by growing a cast with flexible offensive options, instead of grinding your head into a wall.

On Palworld, you can hop on a Ragnahawk or Pyrin with 4 Gobfin on bench and breeze your way through the ENTIRE game. Alternatively, dark-type Nocturnal Pyrin, Frostallion Noct, Helzephyr, Maraith or Nox (These all do the exact same thing. Really, search it up.) and the same Gobfin setup would work. You can easily optimize Palworld by having monotype teams, or teams entirely dedicated to boosting player attack and defense. Which is fine and dandy if it were only an option, and not the playstyle you're forced to take.


Some pok√©mon are allowed to have busted 600 total stats by possessing typing that's disadvantageous to common attacks in the game, such as Mega Scizor, Genesect, Kommo-o, Tyranitar. Alternatively even weak 500 stats are made battle viable through a combination of synergistic typing+ability, such as Eelektross, Spiritomb and Shedinja, having either no weaknesses or being immune to most offensive moves.

On Palworld, none of this would even matter, since damage variance on typing is negligible and there is no immunity for some reason. It's simply damage % stacking upon damage. You can just mash numbers against a wall and it will break, and that's the most if not only viable strategy. This implies a greatly limited design space and variety. New additions to the game will only have bigger and bigger stats with higher damage moves, since that's the only way to make Pals relevant. The current system is made to be powercrept when it could be so much more.

It doesn't help that there is a grand variety of 137 Pals counting environmental variants, with 75% of the "unique" Abilities providing one thing and one thing only: % damage boost. no immunity to anything (such as Lightning Rod or Flash Fire). no speed boost. no speeding up cast time. no conditions to acquire higher stats (such as Guts or Moxie). no applying negative effects (such as Intimidate). no weather effects (such as Sandstream, Drought, Drizzle, etc you get the gist.) Just pure unconditional damage increase. Basically all battle-oriented pals have fucking Huge Power and you can mount on them sometimes. Even then, the most exquisite mount abilities such as active rocket launchers and firethrowers actually just suck, they're extremely underwhelming: completely defeating the purpose of the game's "rule of cool". Seriously think about how cool would be a Pal with weather altering abilities, bringing upon a rain or thunderstorm when it's summoned. Instead we have "Generic Partner Skill Name #78: Boost type damage". or "Generic Partner Skill Name #110: Apply type damage".
            You competely ignore the fact that in virtually every Pok√©mon game, you can literally get through the entire game if you just use your starter the entire time. Many people point out this is what they did as a kid, myself included. Pok√©mon games require no tactical approach unless you actively introduce it yourself (something I unconsciously started doing myself on later runs/games by purposely swapping out my starter).
            TL;DR: Palworld is very simplified and basic in combat design (active/passive/unique skills & typings) meaning there‚Äôs very little strategy, even in team building.

You got me with the ‚ÄúBasically all battle-oriented mons have fucking huge power.‚Äù I never saw it like that until you pointed it out.

I also realized that, because any Pal can learn any move, any meta will always boil down to having multiple of the same Pal on your team. Let‚Äôs say you don‚Äôt care about unique skills, Pal A has the highest base attack stat in the game. You would want to use Pal A in multiple forms because STAB doesn‚Äôt matter and move pools don‚Äôt matter. Why would you use Pal B with a lower base attack stat when Pal A does literally the same thing (again, ignoring Unique Skills)? I don‚Äôt think the unique skills are good enough for you to pass up Pal A for Pal B.
            A very in depth explanation of why this game is too easy.
How exactly do you look at the Pal spheres, and the "collect em all" gameplay and NOT think Pokemon?
    I think they are saying that the *gameplay* of the two games aren't easy to compare. The aesthetics are a ripe comparison, yes.
What if palworld added optional turn-based mode. Would that be possible and has any game done that?
Yup, sounds like Ark. I love Ark, but I doubt I'd love it if I didn't love dinosaurs. Shit is a nightmare very often. 


And that's before the inevitable bugs.
Hard agree, the IVs part of the stat system should have been left at the soul infusions and not another hidden stat tacked on under the hood. Thank fuck there arent EVs, although I guess condensing and souls are tantamount
Yes, and they're saying Palworld didn't improve on it.
I would hardly say turn based combat is a unique experience for pokemon, not at all what I think of when I say 'the pokemon formula'
I think the vast majority would disagree just because they dont evolve or come in a slightly different shade of purple... the overlap in core game mechanics is quite enough to justify a comparison
What about it bothers you? I didnt use it as a replacment for 'for'. It stands for Initial Value, which is a hidden boost to base stats and a breeding mechanic that exists in both pokemon and palworld. Historically it has been a pain in the ass to find out what these values are for newly hatched pokemon, but recently they have made it incredibly accessible. If palworld wants to keep the system, I think its best to make them visible to players without the use of calculators or mods
    Double entendres

    This is the first time I‚Äôm seeing my comment not show because of an edited post. That‚Äôs actually weird lol.
There are no roman numerals in their comment. There's Individual Value (IV) breeding.
IV breeding? That's just the font. He's talking about breeding IVs, what Roman numerals are you talking about?
    IV =4 used for "for" in this context. I don't understand what you mean by font...
        IV is Roman numeral 4, yes, but he's talking about "Individual Values" or IVs.
            ...

I would have literally never figured that out without help... and yet... i STILL don't know what that means. The individual value thing...

                Pokemon define their stats by base stats + IVs. IVs are stats that are added to the pokemon each level depending on what kind of pokemon you have battled and gained exp from. Some pokemon will give you attack, some defence and some speed etc.. When you breed two pokemon the offspring will have bonuses depending on the parents' IV, I don't know exactly how that works mechanically but that's what "IV Breeding" means
                    Damn. I never knew this a thing. Thanks for teaching me about it. ![img](emote|t5_4jn9v4|49342)
                Individual Values means that every Pokemon and Pal has a range of stats it can have.  
  
Not every Grizzbolt will have the same HP, Atk, and Def even if they have the same passives.
Damnnn, Daniel
Part of the problem is Pokemon is owned by 3 companies, Gamefreak, Nintendo, and the Pokemon Company. I doubt all three heads of Cerberus can agree on a new direction when theyve grown so fat on what they do.
    Nintendo wants the game squeaky clean because they have always put themselves first and foremost as a family company. 

Gamefreak wants consistency and money, so no innovation.

And PC barely knows how to code a game to begin with.
        > Nintendo wants the game squeaky clean because they have always put themselves first and foremost as a family company. 

Well, most of the time anyway. For Bayonetta 2 the Link costume originally [had no cleavage at all](https://www.siliconera.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/cho_009.jpg), because Platinum Games was worried about exactly that squeaky clean attitude. However, when they took the designs of the Link, Peach, and Samus costumes to Nintendo for approval Nintendo [asked them to add cleavage to the Link outfit](https://www.siliconera.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/20141024_014750.png).
Game freak rakes in massive profits and continues to sell more games than anyone churning out the same crap. They have no incentive to invest in something like this, their current formula prints money.
You realize that there are ton of pokemon fans, competitive types are a minority of the actual players.
    ‚ÄúThis is what every Pokemon fan has ever wanted‚Äù and I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true, even not on an exaggerated level. I think there are a lot of fans of the game that aren‚Äôt just in it for collecting the Dex. Was just giving the more hardcore community a shout because they DEFINITELY wouldn‚Äôt compare it, and there‚Äôs thousands upon thousands of those people, so it‚Äôs really not that small of a group. Have quite a few friends that just play the mainline games once or twice and don‚Äôt get too into it and even they agree it‚Äôs really not all that similar.
        That last group you mentioned is most likely the biggest part of the Pok√©mon audience. Those that play the games a bit maybe finish the main story.
            Yeah completely agree. It‚Äôs a smaller percent of people sure, but we generally play the games dozens of times through in different ways or have much much longer playthroughs. It‚Äôs also a much higher percent of people playing it year long instead of when the game releases or every few years when they have the urge to
                Which is why palworld is exciting because it's an evolving world. It's not locked in place. I can come back in 6 months and the game could have changed alot. If I come back to scarlet and violet i get to pay $30 bucks for a couple hours of new stuff. And then wait a year for the next $60 game drop
                    Yeah, I‚Äôm super excited for the future, 60 hours for a 30 dollar game is already worth it to me, I‚Äôm sure in the future, especially with modding, this will be a multi 100 hour game
        Yeah Palworld doesn't give me the same feeling at all. I'm not a competitive player by any means but sometimes come back to play some of the more challenging firered rom hacks. 

The main problem with the Pokemon main series for me is the difficulty. You only really scratch the surface of the combat mechanics because the game is so easy. 

Another one is content. They had some neat mechanics like the Pokemon contests. Wish they would extend on stuff like that.
So the majority of longtime Pmon fans myself included agree with the previous statement lol, you don't speak for us in any way, shape, or form. And the competitive circuit is It's own community, most people don't want lumped in with the min-max crowd bc they suck all the fun out of literally everything lol
    It‚Äôs not just competitive min maxers, it‚Äôs nuzlockers, challenge runners, shiny hunters and several other categories. I never claimed it wasn‚Äôt majority, I just think saying it‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs or even almost everyone‚Äôs is just wrong, probably 70% or so would agree, but a lot of people see very little similarities between the two besides ‚Äúcollective monster in ball‚Äù. There really isn‚Äôt much strategy involved with the game and that‚Äôs a huge part of Pokemon for A LOT of people. Disregarding huge portion of the community (even if not the majority, there‚Äôs still A LOT of people that are in one of these groups)
        They're not meant to be compared directly lol, see this is why people say yall suck the fun out of everything. There's plenty of strategy in it's own right. Choosing the right pals/techniques for an encounter makes it much easier, is that not strategy to you? Just bc you can do more in the moment than stand around giving commands doesn't mean it's not strategic. And nuzlockers would live it. I'm doing a no catch run rn where I'm going through the journey without crafting or using a single sphere. Shiny hunters would enjoy the hunts for lucky and Alt types, and I'd love to hear about these other categories bc it sounds like you're just moving goalposts for the sake of not being wrong.
            ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not meant to be compared directly‚Äù

Ok so I‚Äôm right and it‚Äôs not what we‚Äôve been waiting for this whole time lol, if they aren‚Äôt comparable than it‚Äôs not what we waited for it
                No you're just deluded and think you speak for the community as a whole, which your ass backwards opinions contradict. I don't know a single pokemon fan that isn't absolutely insufferable as a human being that doesn't think this game is cool. You can be triggered all you want but yes the majority of Pmon fans think palworld is awesome lol.
                    I‚Äôve literally said multiple times I don‚Äôt speak for the majority? Just a large group of people lol, just stop, I‚Äôm not responding anymore to this needless agression
Not me.
    I think Pokemon Violet was a lot like Palworld. Because  once I got to the part you are supposed to walk up the hill to school, I just explored the entire map climbing mountains and catching Pals instead.
Theres people who played pokemon r/b/y/g/s and stopped. Being a pokemon fan doesnt mean youve purchased/played every game in the franchise. This game works well for people who only played gen 1/2 pokemon and happen to like survival games too. Ask someone if they enjoyed valheim, ask if they played pokemon red/blue. If the answer is yes to both theyll enjoy palworld.
    What part of RGBY would match palworld? If anything people who played the more modern games that actually are open world (legends arceus and SV) are more likely to enjoy palworld if only because the open world design similarity. A thin connection but a bigger one than saying "oh you played pokemon 25 years ago? You'll love this survival game where you collect monsters." There have been plenty of monster collector games since, it takes more than catching monsters to be a good game.

It's disingenuous to conflate pokemon gameplay to palworld and i really don't think there's any connection. Hell my palworld friend actively does not like pokemon and never has and he loves palworld, because they're not the same.
        You‚Äôve got such a rage boner that you‚Äôre conflating everything i‚Äôve said. I‚Äôm done talking at you, if you want discourse i‚Äôll come back later when you‚Äôve had your juice box and chill out.
Conan exiles and Ark are the big ones I‚Äôd assume
    Grounded too!
The game has everything but doesn't shine in anything

Base building is barebones, farming/pet management simulator is barebones too

Figts need balancing

Story non existent

The game is absolutely worth the money, but it has very big room for growth
    Yep. I‚Äôd also argue the tower bosses are‚Ä¶ just there. Even the lowest level boss with Grizzbolt? Is way harder than the content around it. 

The other bosses except maybe Lily are super tough. 

We need to bring the tower bosses into lore other than the logs, because they are kinda just there. Optional content as such.
        The lore, loosely from what I‚Äôve gathered, is that the island used to be ruled by the legends. People and pals lived in harmony. The tower bosses are the leaders of the various groups that changed the landscape by outcasting the legends and humans alike and taking power for themselves. This is why there‚Äôs relatively few unallied humans and the legends live off in their little corners.
Just FYI you can't make it to the big tree without glitching around the skybox.
I hope they can change the research point system. I wasted so many points on early items because at that point you could afford everything. Now in the tail end of the game I have to hunt down manuals to unlock what I really want to use.
Which? The major souls-likes  have a story. Zelda and Skyrim have side quests. Minecraft is probably the one exception.
    7 days to die  
Terraria  
Factorio  
Rimworld  
Ark (mostly)  
Mount & Blade  
Valheim  
Enshrouded
    None of those games are survival sandboxes.

Survivals sole point is you‚Äôre gonna need to explore if you want to survive/progress.

It‚Äôs a genre that really doesn‚Äôt need heavy story elements other than explaining why you‚Äôre in this mess.
    Minecraft, Roblox, Fortnite, GTA, Ark, etc.
Calling the adventurer logs a story is a joke and you know it
    I wouldn't call it a story, more of background information and observations on pals, the world and the various bosses.
    Yeah I like the game but thats kinda cope
It's like subnautica in a sense
If they want investments from others rather than using their own money, yes. It's not "required" but most companies that want growth see it as a faster and cheaper way to go about it.
    Not the only way. They could leverage, they could sell minority ownership to one person to retain control, and they can use the profits to grow. Speaking as a business owner, incorporating is NOT even close to the only option.
It can, see Valve for an example of a company staying private.

But it can be difficult to get serious amounts of investment money into your company without the prospect of turning into a public share model company.
There's plenty of large private companies but private investment is generally more expensive than public. And much less liquid
    Not to mention that large private companies tend to have less media coverage precisely because there's not as much public interest in their performance.

If you have investors. They want a higher bottom line every quarter or there will be changes. It honestly kills a lot of games. And I don't know if this is true.. but I heard in the US if you knowingly do something that will cause that bottom line to shrink... Even if it's good for the long-term of the company you can be outed from the company.
Just like any other non-live service game? Like wtf are you even saying?

How many people are playing The Witcher 2 right now???!
    Elden ring did not lose 95% of its player base in a month. Neither did baldurs gate.

I am not even going to respond to your attempt at a comparison because it is utterly asinine and ridiculous.
Nothing to do and nothing *you want* to do are different.
    Mr condenser over here
        I mean, it's something to do.
            Tis true. Y'all have fun with that king
So‚Ä¶ play a new game‚Ä¶ Jesus

Ooo that‚Äôs a really fantastic idea! I don‚Äôt mind some grinding but breeding is so tedious. I‚Äôve never used mods before but I also heard there‚Äôs one that lets you share items in boxes between bases so maybe I‚Äôll start looking into that :)
    Hopefully they're paying attention to mod creation and traction, then integrate the most popular mods into game mechanics.

Like, say, you're happy with your second/third base placement and you want to share resources. Now you have to lay down a rail or pipe system between bases to enable that. Takes time to build and gets attacked as you're building, but once built is safe and makes all materials available.

Or maybe it's never safe from attack and another building near the transfer tiles in the tech tree opens up a command and conquer style game play where you send in pals from the box to counter attack.

Breeding seems to have the most complaints. Create a nursery pal or two that ups high IV odds / makes attaining the perks you want easier. Could adjust them so the benefits from them grow as you breed/capture stronger pals.
I'm playing the game on hard mode... But I think I'll have dedicated breeding days where I turn it to easy. Because ain't no way I'm waiting days for breeding.

The fact the timers stop the moment you exit the game is insane to me.... Having to play 20+ hours for a large egg.. absurd.

Nothing else grindy bothers me though. I'm happy to not rush through the game like most people, having nothing left to do in game.

Plus, I'm thinking, if you rush to overpowered pals.. then all of the games challenge is Really eliminated. It's not like there's pvp yet. You're just gonna be blasting through bosses and to collecting things, and repeat.

 Now That can get Boring!
    Well as long as people had fun playing at the pace they did it's good. I definitely did the end game stuff faster than most would, but I had fun. Anyways I still have things to do
    Huh? Is that a single player thing? I'm on a server, and the egg timers keep going when you log off. Having to actually wait 20 hours in game is terrible
        Yup. It's cause servers run all the time
> Agreed but pokemon is still falling

Pokemon on the Switch has sold the most copies of any games in the franchise sans Red and Blue
¬†"pokemon is still falling"

This is what being terminally online does to a motherfucker lmao.
    Yeah, you can dislike Pokemon since you 'outgrown it' but to say it falling off is stupid. It a household name nobody really knows palworld except for gamers.
Kinda like false swipe right?
You can go "over" the red wall but then there's another invisible barrier thats a bit closer to the tree
    Fun fact. Technically its not an other invisible barrier, its the collision of the tree.
The fect that pocket pair uses unreal engine 5.1 for palworld and the default collision for a imported model is a  "simple"  collision  what that does is it is looking at the form of the model and than make a collision barrier around the full model fromfrom top to bottom.
But it the gonna set the collision to " use  complex collision" it would look at the model and based on the polygons of the model its would be the same for the collision.
So its really just the model collision and not a invisible barrier 

But i think the devs didn't predict that the players still could find a way to go over it. 

Still a good place to make a farming base as i did  its mostly flat and no other pals or raids comming there
I, too, tried to go around it. For a good minute I went along the red wall, hoping there would be a way in‚Ä¶
On that note the devs said they‚Äôre planning for 4 major releases, which would correspond to the 3 other corners and the island of the big tree itself
    Hope one of those updates includes a huge underground system
They have already stated new Islands would be coming
The big tree concept sounds super intriguing, like it could be a central hub connecting these islands, and maybe each island has its own unique ecosystem? That'd keep things fresh and give a reason to explore, more than just a level cap incentive. Plus, imagine if each new island came with its own set of challenges or environmental hazards to survive.
    That's what I'm hoping, something different environmentally as well as the pals that'll spawn

Considering what they put out to start with, I do have hope they could give us something exciting with new islands and such
    >That'd keep things fresh

So what you're saying is that right now we are in Kanto, soon there will be Johto and eventually Hoenn, Sinnoh, Unova and (checks notes...) _Paldea_.
At 10 level increments. Primary release to 50. 3 expansion releases at 10 levels a piece.
    Would make sense too, I really don‚Äôt see the next update suddenly adding lvl 80 pals (and the next updates 100/140)
    In a year or 2 mabye
I feel like they need to add more requirements for leveling after 50 too. Like to get to 60 you need xp and a certain amount of your paldex filled out or something just to make it a little harder to max out
I get what you‚Äôre saying but flying mounts kind of make that unnecessary. I still would like them to add that kind of stuff as an option. Underwater areas would be so cool. They could even add scuba gear.
    There are possible lore accurate ways to prevent flying in certain places to make use of other kinds of mechanics
        I think that would be a bad move personally
            Don't want caves or underwater bioms?
                I do but I still want the option to fly over water. Maybe I misunderstood
        Tbh they should just make your flying pal go back into its ball if they ‚Äúland‚Äù over water while mounted in order to make water pals more useful
            Not from just landing on water, but maybe if they run out of stamina and fall onto water.
    Eh, the way the stamina system works with flying mounts, it's more efficient to just take a water mount that doesn't drain stam when in the water for long ocean trips, then switch once you make landfall, rather than starting out with a flyer and having to take frequent rest stops
    If there's a water mount that surfs faster than flying mounts then they would be viable
    Flying mounts do make you descend every once in a while which is kind of annoying and a different experience than a water mount, which I'd definitely like.
I think it even says as much in the journals or in some of the item flavor text. Something about the energy from the tree making palladium and it's carried through the water which is why all the small palladium rocks spawn by oceans/rivers
    Great, there goes who knows how many hours searching out the journals.
this would be very cool
wildcard made truly awful decisions one after another even after getting bailed out numerous times. im expecting ark 2 to be some kind of singleplayer only game, or at least heavily narrative based. it just seems so odd to me they're spending all this time making ARK: SA when ARK 2 is supposedly coming out this year. they're gonna have two competing games in the same franchise confusing new players. why they wouldn't just keep making ARK 2 until it's done I don't know, maybe they desperately needed a cash infusion or maybe I'm right and it's not gonna be a pvp survivalcraft at all.
    Because a huge percentage of the ark player base has absolutely zero interest in a third person only arksouls conan evolved game. People just wanted ark to work properly and be playable. Unfortunately ASA is the same turd as ASE except this turd has been rolled in glitter.
        i mean, tons of people play ark in third person. i'm not making any definitive assumptions on gameplay until we see gameplay footage or their marketing ramps up.
    Well, ARK 2 is going to be nothing like ARK: SA, ARK 2 is a souls like narrative driven game and will be almost an entirely different game from ARK: SA, the only thing that will link ARK 2 to the original ARKs will be the lore and dinosaurs

The reason they made ARK: SA was to please fans of ARK: SE Since most of us didn‚Äôt want a souls like version of ARK, we wanted regular ARK
        Are you sure about that? I don't think they ever said anywhere ARK 2 *wouldn't* be survival craft, but they said it would have more soulsy on-foot combat, which doesn't mean a survival craft is dead. But idk.
            Well im sure its gonna still have survival crafting, but last I checked they were focusing on 3rd person souls like exploration/combat which is absolutely different than what we have in ARK:SE/A Which is unique
Indoubtedly
This is why I loved Legends Arceus so much, it started dipping its toes into the darker side, like the casual mention of Pokemon wanting to murder you. But then they threw that away with scarlet and violet, and Legends only just barely dipped its toes in. Palworld just dove head first into the darkness
    Doesn‚Äôt Palworld‚Äôs reminds you quite a bit of arceus? It definitely made me go hmmmmm
        Literally the only relation it has is that it's cute creatures caught in balls and it's open world. Totally different concept otherwise if you ask me. The similarities are numerous but it's really not as similar as alot of people say. (I'll admit I've accidentally called some pals by the Pokemon they look similar to
I personally wouldn‚Äôt even necessarily be frustrated with them if they couldn‚Äôt fix it. It would go a long way toward making the game a better experience but npc AI seems to be something even AAA studios struggle with sometimes. 

I don‚Äôt know what all they‚Äôre working with, but if they keep putting out content and fixing what they can I‚Äôll be coming back. That just happens to be the biggest item on my wishlist.
I love Pal world. They did a lot of great things.

What they did not do is deliver a strategy game; and pokemon very much is. Lots of mind games with the team you bring to a rank match, because you don‚Äôt use all of them; the switches you make mid battle to try to gain a type advantage; the move selection you choose and the type coverage it offers.

And I will **always** prefer evolutions on my creature collectors. I don‚Äôt really like having 2 pals that are clearly related. I don‚Äôt care about world building, I care about how I used my pengullet for 20 levels: I don‚Äôt want to capture a new penking, I want my pengullet to evolve

Palworld **changed** and then improved on Pok√©mon. I still want the open world ‚Äúpokemon‚Äù game too. I‚Äôm greedy sure; but I know Nintendo is too

Edit: ‚Äútiming‚Äù does not equal ‚Äústrategy‚Äù. palworld has zero strategy involved. It‚Äôs an action game where we can use actions to time switches to gain a benefit. But there is no ‚Äúshould I try to dodge, or should I face tank it‚Äù. You should try to dodge.

Double edit: I forgot this sub is full of children who have to go ‚ÄúAcTuAlY‚Äù to every little thing. Thank you for giving me the push to leave the sub
    If you try facing enemy's 5 levels above you, strategy, assigned attacks and subbing out are very much a thing as your guns do literally 9-11 damage per hit. I'm not to fussed on evolutions myself, as most are unique enough to not seem related in the way you draw lines between pokemon lineage.
        Pulling Pals defensively to avoid attacks is also something to be mindful of during a fight.
        I would claim that ‚ÄúSubbing‚Äù in this game is not a ‚Äústrategy‚Äù. All you think is ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to get hit better recall my pal‚Äù. It‚Äôs a test of your timing skill, not your critical thinking skill

While Subbing in pokemon is deciding to give your opponent an immediate benefit, so that you can gain a future benefit; that is strategy
            Eh, it's still boiling back to live vs turn based, in a live pokemon battle you also wouldn't have time to map a strategy like you do in turnbased, it's tennis vs chess.

Edit: not sure why you blocked me after last reply but OK lol
                
Then open world pokemon game will still be turn based, just like Arcues/Scarlet/violet‚Ä¶what‚Äôs your point?

Edit: I blocked them for continuing to change what I am trying to talk about and ignoring what I was saying‚Ä¶.this wasn‚Äôt a discussion it was the other user talking at me.

Edit for the person below; I hope you get the help you need friend ‚ù§Ô∏è
    Turn based combat is a very heavy mechanic in pokemon, but I dont really see it as a defining feature at all and is incredibly boring and dated imho
        bro turn based combat is like, a hallmark of many s-tier rpg's lol. that's like saying fps is boring and dated because its a heavy mechanic in doom/wolfenstein. (for the record i'm not dissing you for disliking turn based combat, i see what you're getting at)
            I don't think they were saying that turn-based combat ***in general*** is boring and dated, but rather that ***Pokemon's*** turn-based combat is boring and dated... which is accurate, IMO. They really haven't changed it all that much from the original Pokemon games.
                Mmm fair point lol. Pokemon‚Äôs rigid formula is incredibly stale and I haven‚Äôt fully played through one since sword/shield, which i found exceedingly disappointing
                Because it's a solid system and doesn't have to change. If you e played competitive pokemon you'll see that pokemons turn based gameplay is actually very intense, turn by turn reads and plays are wild. If you're into chess and card games, competitive pokemon would be right up your alley. 

What the games need are better stories, better AI, and higher difficulty. And even then, the latest DLC actually gave us an entire zone where every battle was a double battle with the NPCs using real items and strats, they're getting there finally.
        Turn based combat as a whole will never be ‚Äúdated‚Äù what are you smoking? 

People care about their joints; we can‚Äôt just play button smashing action games all the time. That‚Äôs how you get carpal tunnel
            I don't mind turn based combat in abstract 2d games but with the modern 3d style of new pokemon games it's pathetic
                Why?

Edit: *is it ‚Äúpathetic‚Äù*
        Lol there is a global level tournament for pokemon battling, it is the basis of how the card game works, it's what the anime is based on, it is the core gameplay system of the series for almost 30 years...


How is that NOT a defining feature? You can think it's boring and you're welcome to your opinion but it's a silly stance to take as truth. Is chess boring? Hasn't changed its gameplay in actual centuries yet it's still the most recognized boardgame/strategy game in the world? Is LoL boring for not having changed its gameplay in the 15 years since its release?

YOU might not care for it and that's a fine opinion to have, same as I don't care for shooters. But let's not live in our own mental canon where mainline pokemon games ARENT DEFINED by their turn based strategy elements. That's like saying main Mario games arent defined by their platforming elements. It's a silly take.

It's not boring, it's not dated. It's actually very intense, takes a lot of practice and game knowledge to be good at and has a rich strategic elements. Again you don't have to love it but calling it boring and dated is like calling chess boring and dated.
"The game people wanted", no, think what you might like, most fans *don't* want something edgy or over the top like Palworld.
    You can deny it as long as you want, but the majority of people who bought it love pokemon and are keen to see the more adult pokemon world, meanwhile pokemon still tries to sanitise the whole enslaving creatures to cockfight aspect.
        Or majority bought it for the memes and don't engage in the vocal group that say "THIS IS WHAT POKEMON SHOULD BE LIKE"
            Like I said feel, free to deny it as long as you want
More things in common with Pokemon in a way lol. There's lots of knowledge and skill expression in Pokemon that very few ever even touch because the base game doesn't challenge you enough.
Gigantic Pokemon fan here. Team building only matters because of the battle system. The fun world is only an additional part. You remove the battle system, and it stops feeling like Pokemon and just feels like chaos.

Palworld is entirely different because of this. There‚Äôs no strategy. You can actually return your Pals as a move is hitting them to prevent damage and then send them back out. Typings don‚Äôt matter cause any Pal can learn any type move and STAB is negligible compared to other passives.
    Eh. I've played multiple Pok√©mon games where I shot through with the same team for pretty much the entire game, ignoring the battle system.
        This is my beef with a lot of the newer Pokemon games tbh. Ever since they turned the exp share on permanently, you don‚Äôt really even have to try anymore for the most part. 

There are some good mods and stuff out there though where strategy is definitely still very important. And that does make for a much more engaging experience imo. 

I do love both Pokemon and Palworld but I agree that they give different vibes - at least when Pokemon is done right or is at a competitive level.
            You never really needed to use more than one pokemon. You could just overlevel one pokemon and then keep the rest as revive sacrifices.
    its better than pokemon just deal with it they did what hey should have done palsworld should partner with digimon for their first cosmetic drop
    That's the thing. Team building in palworld doesn't just revolve around the battling. You have to consider traversal, resource gathering and the environment and time of day. Not to mention the whole base team. If the battle system was the most important thing in Pok√©mon how come the anime, the card game, pokken, mystery dungeon, snap etc still feels like Pok√©mon

There is a lot of strategy. Tho the strategy is different. You have to think more on your feet. There isn't a pause to give you time to plan. Typings matter arguably more than in Pok√©mon because of the simplified type chart..
        There really isn't a lot of strategy. Game is piss easy, which isn't a bad thing, but you can go guns blazing and succeed more often than not lol



Half the stuff you listed is a bit of a reach. Traversal options don't require strategy. It boils down to use flier or use ground mount. Thats it. 


Hell, you can completely ignore type advantages and still win. It won't even be difficult.
    >Palworld is entirely different because of this. There‚Äôs no strategy.

Pokemons strategy is exclusively type countering, pokemon also has potions which completely negate using any strategy. Which is fine because the game is designed that way.

Theres a reason why every pokemon game, if you exclusively use your starter you will go through every bad type match up gym completely out leveling them. Not to mention types don't even matter when you can learn adjacent type abilities.
        This was basically my strat as a kid. Went through every generation up to platinum just using my starter to burst through everything. 

Strategy: grass type? Charizard. Flying type? Charizard water type? Charizard

Except Fire Red, where I was possessed by the rat spirit and went through the game with 2 Rattata that never evolved.
    So do you like Palworld still or not really. Genuine question.
    Well by that logic Pokemon has no strategy either. You can steamroll through with just one move ignoring type altogether as long as you level a single mon enough. And that's exactly how I played it when I was a kid
    I agree! By now I've played Palworld to level 45 with a bunch of friends, beating every single tower boss but Victor/Shadowbeak and capturing every single Alpha pal available. The combat system is fine for as long as shooting up bullets and rockets into pocket monsters seem funny to you. Gets boring really fast, specially if you're hoping to find any tactical approach. It all boils down to variance and design space.

It could be easily remedied by increasing the relevancy of Pal/move types and Unique Abilities. Something easily done and worked on given enough time to playtest and refine. 

For reference: 
ON POK√âMON Type advantage may go up to 4x or 400% move damage. 
Disadvantage may go down to 0.25x or 25% or even 0 (Type immunity)
STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) adds 50% of a move's power to its total power before calculation if it has the same typing as the user.

ON PALWORLD type advantage may go up to 1.4x or 140% move damage. That's 260% less upwards variance than pok√©mon.
Disadvantage goes down to 0.6x or 60% move damage. That's 45% less downwards variance than pok√©mon, 60% less if you consider the lack of immunity in Palworld. (although these numbers might not be precise, they might actually err to less)
STAB on Palworld also adds only 20% to a move's power before damage calc. (confirmed value) That's 30% less impactful than pok√©mon.

The result is a dumbed down version of the pok√©mon battle system requiring little care for choice and variance. Since its conception, pok√©mon gym leaders employ monotype team compositions SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED to give the player an edge by growing a cast with flexible offensive options, instead of grinding your head into a wall.

On Palworld, you can hop on a Ragnahawk or Pyrin with 4 Gobfin on bench and breeze your way through the ENTIRE game. Alternatively, dark-type Nocturnal Pyrin, Frostallion Noct, Helzephyr, Maraith or Nox (These all do the exact same thing. Really, search it up.) and the same Gobfin setup would work. You can easily optimize Palworld by having monotype teams, or teams entirely dedicated to boosting player attack and defense. Which is fine and dandy if it were only an option, and not the playstyle you're forced to take.


Some pok√©mon are allowed to have busted 600 total stats by possessing typing that's disadvantageous to common attacks in the game, such as Mega Scizor, Genesect, Kommo-o, Tyranitar. Alternatively even weak 500 stats are made battle viable through a combination of synergistic typing+ability, such as Eelektross, Spiritomb and Shedinja, having either no weaknesses or being immune to most offensive moves.

On Palworld, none of this would even matter, since damage variance on typing is negligible and there is no immunity for some reason. It's simply damage % stacking upon damage. You can just mash numbers against a wall and it will break, and that's the most if not only viable strategy. This implies a greatly limited design space and variety. New additions to the game will only have bigger and bigger stats with higher damage moves, since that's the only way to make Pals relevant. The current system is made to be powercrept when it could be so much more.

It doesn't help that there is a grand variety of 137 Pals counting environmental variants, with 75% of the "unique" Abilities providing one thing and one thing only: % damage boost. no immunity to anything (such as Lightning Rod or Flash Fire). no speed boost. no speeding up cast time. no conditions to acquire higher stats (such as Guts or Moxie). no applying negative effects (such as Intimidate). no weather effects (such as Sandstream, Drought, Drizzle, etc you get the gist.) Just pure unconditional damage increase. Basically all battle-oriented pals have fucking Huge Power and you can mount on them sometimes. Even then, the most exquisite mount abilities such as active rocket launchers and firethrowers actually just suck, they're extremely underwhelming: completely defeating the purpose of the game's "rule of cool". Seriously think about how cool would be a Pal with weather altering abilities, bringing upon a rain or thunderstorm when it's summoned. Instead we have "Generic Partner Skill Name #78: Boost type damage". or "Generic Partner Skill Name #110: Apply type damage".
        You competely ignore the fact that in virtually every Pok√©mon game, you can literally get through the entire game if you just use your starter the entire time. Many people point out this is what they did as a kid, myself included. Pok√©mon games require no tactical approach unless you actively introduce it yourself (something I unconsciously started doing myself on later runs/games by purposely swapping out my starter).
        TL;DR: Palworld is very simplified and basic in combat design (active/passive/unique skills & typings) meaning there‚Äôs very little strategy, even in team building.

You got me with the ‚ÄúBasically all battle-oriented mons have fucking huge power.‚Äù I never saw it like that until you pointed it out.

I also realized that, because any Pal can learn any move, any meta will always boil down to having multiple of the same Pal on your team. Let‚Äôs say you don‚Äôt care about unique skills, Pal A has the highest base attack stat in the game. You would want to use Pal A in multiple forms because STAB doesn‚Äôt matter and move pools don‚Äôt matter. Why would you use Pal B with a lower base attack stat when Pal A does literally the same thing (again, ignoring Unique Skills)? I don‚Äôt think the unique skills are good enough for you to pass up Pal A for Pal B.
        A very in depth explanation of why this game is too easy.
I think they are saying that the *gameplay* of the two games aren't easy to compare. The aesthetics are a ripe comparison, yes.
Double entendres
This is the first time I‚Äôm seeing my comment not show because of an edited post. That‚Äôs actually weird lol.
IV =4 used for "for" in this context. I don't understand what you mean by font...
    IV is Roman numeral 4, yes, but he's talking about "Individual Values" or IVs.
        ...

I would have literally never figured that out without help... and yet... i STILL don't know what that means. The individual value thing...

https://preview.redd.it/mspi5hpkh6jc1.png?width=1169&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=93b4123c55ee9d8e688154581c216a84e684fc5d
            Pokemon define their stats by base stats + IVs. IVs are stats that are added to the pokemon each level depending on what kind of pokemon you have battled and gained exp from. Some pokemon will give you attack, some defence and some speed etc.. When you breed two pokemon the offspring will have bonuses depending on the parents' IV, I don't know exactly how that works mechanically but that's what "IV Breeding" means
                Damn. I never knew this a thing. Thanks for teaching me about it. ![img](emote|t5_4jn9v4|49342)
            Individual Values means that every Pokemon and Pal has a range of stats it can have.  
  
Not every Grizzbolt will have the same HP, Atk, and Def even if they have the same passives.
Nintendo wants the game squeaky clean because they have always put themselves first and foremost as a family company. 

Gamefreak wants consistency and money, so no innovation.

And PC barely knows how to code a game to begin with.
    > Nintendo wants the game squeaky clean because they have always put themselves first and foremost as a family company. 

Well, most of the time anyway. For Bayonetta 2 the Link costume originally [had no cleavage at all](https://www.siliconera.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/cho_009.jpg), because Platinum Games was worried about exactly that squeaky clean attitude. However, when they took the designs of the Link, Peach, and Samus costumes to Nintendo for approval Nintendo [asked them to add cleavage to the Link outfit](https://www.siliconera.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/20141024_014750.png).
‚ÄúThis is what every Pokemon fan has ever wanted‚Äù and I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true, even not on an exaggerated level. I think there are a lot of fans of the game that aren‚Äôt just in it for collecting the Dex. Was just giving the more hardcore community a shout because they DEFINITELY wouldn‚Äôt compare it, and there‚Äôs thousands upon thousands of those people, so it‚Äôs really not that small of a group. Have quite a few friends that just play the mainline games once or twice and don‚Äôt get too into it and even they agree it‚Äôs really not all that similar.
    That last group you mentioned is most likely the biggest part of the Pok√©mon audience. Those that play the games a bit maybe finish the main story.
        Yeah completely agree. It‚Äôs a smaller percent of people sure, but we generally play the games dozens of times through in different ways or have much much longer playthroughs. It‚Äôs also a much higher percent of people playing it year long instead of when the game releases or every few years when they have the urge to
            Which is why palworld is exciting because it's an evolving world. It's not locked in place. I can come back in 6 months and the game could have changed alot. If I come back to scarlet and violet i get to pay $30 bucks for a couple hours of new stuff. And then wait a year for the next $60 game drop
                Yeah, I‚Äôm super excited for the future, 60 hours for a 30 dollar game is already worth it to me, I‚Äôm sure in the future, especially with modding, this will be a multi 100 hour game
    Yeah Palworld doesn't give me the same feeling at all. I'm not a competitive player by any means but sometimes come back to play some of the more challenging firered rom hacks. 

The main problem with the Pokemon main series for me is the difficulty. You only really scratch the surface of the combat mechanics because the game is so easy. 

Another one is content. They had some neat mechanics like the Pokemon contests. Wish they would extend on stuff like that.
It‚Äôs not just competitive min maxers, it‚Äôs nuzlockers, challenge runners, shiny hunters and several other categories. I never claimed it wasn‚Äôt majority, I just think saying it‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs or even almost everyone‚Äôs is just wrong, probably 70% or so would agree, but a lot of people see very little similarities between the two besides ‚Äúcollective monster in ball‚Äù. There really isn‚Äôt much strategy involved with the game and that‚Äôs a huge part of Pokemon for A LOT of people. Disregarding huge portion of the community (even if not the majority, there‚Äôs still A LOT of people that are in one of these groups)
    They're not meant to be compared directly lol, see this is why people say yall suck the fun out of everything. There's plenty of strategy in it's own right. Choosing the right pals/techniques for an encounter makes it much easier, is that not strategy to you? Just bc you can do more in the moment than stand around giving commands doesn't mean it's not strategic. And nuzlockers would live it. I'm doing a no catch run rn where I'm going through the journey without crafting or using a single sphere. Shiny hunters would enjoy the hunts for lucky and Alt types, and I'd love to hear about these other categories bc it sounds like you're just moving goalposts for the sake of not being wrong.
        ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not meant to be compared directly‚Äù

Ok so I‚Äôm right and it‚Äôs not what we‚Äôve been waiting for this whole time lol, if they aren‚Äôt comparable than it‚Äôs not what we waited for it
            No you're just deluded and think you speak for the community as a whole, which your ass backwards opinions contradict. I don't know a single pokemon fan that isn't absolutely insufferable as a human being that doesn't think this game is cool. You can be triggered all you want but yes the majority of Pmon fans think palworld is awesome lol.
                I‚Äôve literally said multiple times I don‚Äôt speak for the majority? Just a large group of people lol, just stop, I‚Äôm not responding anymore to this needless agression
I think Pokemon Violet was a lot like Palworld. Because  once I got to the part you are supposed to walk up the hill to school, I just explored the entire map climbing mountains and catching Pals instead.
What part of RGBY would match palworld? If anything people who played the more modern games that actually are open world (legends arceus and SV) are more likely to enjoy palworld if only because the open world design similarity. A thin connection but a bigger one than saying "oh you played pokemon 25 years ago? You'll love this survival game where you collect monsters." There have been plenty of monster collector games since, it takes more than catching monsters to be a good game.

It's disingenuous to conflate pokemon gameplay to palworld and i really don't think there's any connection. Hell my palworld friend actively does not like pokemon and never has and he loves palworld, because they're not the same.
    You‚Äôve got such a rage boner that you‚Äôre conflating everything i‚Äôve said. I‚Äôm done talking at you, if you want discourse i‚Äôll come back later when you‚Äôve had your juice box and chill out.
Grounded too!
Yep. I‚Äôd also argue the tower bosses are‚Ä¶ just there. Even the lowest level boss with Grizzbolt? Is way harder than the content around it. 

The other bosses except maybe Lily are super tough. 

We need to bring the tower bosses into lore other than the logs, because they are kinda just there. Optional content as such.
    The lore, loosely from what I‚Äôve gathered, is that the island used to be ruled by the legends. People and pals lived in harmony. The tower bosses are the leaders of the various groups that changed the landscape by outcasting the legends and humans alike and taking power for themselves. This is why there‚Äôs relatively few unallied humans and the legends live off in their little corners.

None of those games are survival sandboxes.

Survivals sole point is you‚Äôre gonna need to explore if you want to survive/progress.

It‚Äôs a genre that really doesn‚Äôt need heavy story elements other than explaining why you‚Äôre in this mess.
Minecraft, Roblox, Fortnite, GTA, Ark, etc.
I wouldn't call it a story, more of background information and observations on pals, the world and the various bosses.
Yeah I like the game but thats kinda cope
Not the only way. They could leverage, they could sell minority ownership to one person to retain control, and they can use the profits to grow. Speaking as a business owner, incorporating is NOT even close to the only option.
Not to mention that large private companies tend to have less media coverage precisely because there's not as much public interest in their performance.
Elden ring did not lose 95% of its player base in a month. Neither did baldurs gate.

I am not even going to respond to your attempt at a comparison because it is utterly asinine and ridiculous.
Mr condenser over here
    I mean, it's something to do.
        Tis true. Y'all have fun with that king
Hopefully they're paying attention to mod creation and traction, then integrate the most popular mods into game mechanics.

Like, say, you're happy with your second/third base placement and you want to share resources. Now you have to lay down a rail or pipe system between bases to enable that. Takes time to build and gets attacked as you're building, but once built is safe and makes all materials available.

Or maybe it's never safe from attack and another building near the transfer tiles in the tech tree opens up a command and conquer style game play where you send in pals from the box to counter attack.

Breeding seems to have the most complaints. Create a nursery pal or two that ups high IV odds / makes attaining the perks you want easier. Could adjust them so the benefits from them grow as you breed/capture stronger pals.
Well as long as people had fun playing at the pace they did it's good. I definitely did the end game stuff faster than most would, but I had fun. Anyways I still have things to do
Huh? Is that a single player thing? I'm on a server, and the egg timers keep going when you log off. Having to actually wait 20 hours in game is terrible
    Yup. It's cause servers run all the time
Yeah, you can dislike Pokemon since you 'outgrown it' but to say it falling off is stupid. It a household name nobody really knows palworld except for gamers.
Fun fact. Technically its not an other invisible barrier, its the collision of the tree.
The fect that pocket pair uses unreal engine 5.1 for palworld and the default collision for a imported model is a  "simple"  collision  what that does is it is looking at the form of the model and than make a collision barrier around the full model fromfrom top to bottom.
But it the gonna set the collision to " use  complex collision" it would look at the model and based on the polygons of the model its would be the same for the collision.
So its really just the model collision and not a invisible barrier 

But i think the devs didn't predict that the players still could find a way to go over it. 

Still a good place to make a farming base as i did  its mostly flat and no other pals or raids comming there
Hope one of those updates includes a huge underground system
That's what I'm hoping, something different environmentally as well as the pals that'll spawn

Considering what they put out to start with, I do have hope they could give us something exciting with new islands and such
>That'd keep things fresh

So what you're saying is that right now we are in Kanto, soon there will be Johto and eventually Hoenn, Sinnoh, Unova and (checks notes...) _Paldea_.
Would make sense too, I really don‚Äôt see the next update suddenly adding lvl 80 pals (and the next updates 100/140)
In a year or 2 mabye
There are possible lore accurate ways to prevent flying in certain places to make use of other kinds of mechanics
    I think that would be a bad move personally
        Don't want caves or underwater bioms?
            I do but I still want the option to fly over water. Maybe I misunderstood
    Tbh they should just make your flying pal go back into its ball if they ‚Äúland‚Äù over water while mounted in order to make water pals more useful
        Not from just landing on water, but maybe if they run out of stamina and fall onto water.
Eh, the way the stamina system works with flying mounts, it's more efficient to just take a water mount that doesn't drain stam when in the water for long ocean trips, then switch once you make landfall, rather than starting out with a flyer and having to take frequent rest stops
If there's a water mount that surfs faster than flying mounts then they would be viable
Flying mounts do make you descend every once in a while which is kind of annoying and a different experience than a water mount, which I'd definitely like.
Great, there goes who knows how many hours searching out the journals.
Because a huge percentage of the ark player base has absolutely zero interest in a third person only arksouls conan evolved game. People just wanted ark to work properly and be playable. Unfortunately ASA is the same turd as ASE except this turd has been rolled in glitter.
    i mean, tons of people play ark in third person. i'm not making any definitive assumptions on gameplay until we see gameplay footage or their marketing ramps up.
Well, ARK 2 is going to be nothing like ARK: SA, ARK 2 is a souls like narrative driven game and will be almost an entirely different game from ARK: SA, the only thing that will link ARK 2 to the original ARKs will be the lore and dinosaurs

The reason they made ARK: SA was to please fans of ARK: SE Since most of us didn‚Äôt want a souls like version of ARK, we wanted regular ARK
    Are you sure about that? I don't think they ever said anywhere ARK 2 *wouldn't* be survival craft, but they said it would have more soulsy on-foot combat, which doesn't mean a survival craft is dead. But idk.
        Well im sure its gonna still have survival crafting, but last I checked they were focusing on 3rd person souls like exploration/combat which is absolutely different than what we have in ARK:SE/A Which is unique
Doesn‚Äôt Palworld‚Äôs reminds you quite a bit of arceus? It definitely made me go hmmmmm
    Literally the only relation it has is that it's cute creatures caught in balls and it's open world. Totally different concept otherwise if you ask me. The similarities are numerous but it's really not as similar as alot of people say. (I'll admit I've accidentally called some pals by the Pokemon they look similar to
If you try facing enemy's 5 levels above you, strategy, assigned attacks and subbing out are very much a thing as your guns do literally 9-11 damage per hit. I'm not to fussed on evolutions myself, as most are unique enough to not seem related in the way you draw lines between pokemon lineage.
    Pulling Pals defensively to avoid attacks is also something to be mindful of during a fight.
    I would claim that ‚ÄúSubbing‚Äù in this game is not a ‚Äústrategy‚Äù. All you think is ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to get hit better recall my pal‚Äù. It‚Äôs a test of your timing skill, not your critical thinking skill

While Subbing in pokemon is deciding to give your opponent an immediate benefit, so that you can gain a future benefit; that is strategy
        Eh, it's still boiling back to live vs turn based, in a live pokemon battle you also wouldn't have time to map a strategy like you do in turnbased, it's tennis vs chess.

Edit: not sure why you blocked me after last reply but OK lol
            
Then open world pokemon game will still be turn based, just like Arcues/Scarlet/violet‚Ä¶what‚Äôs your point?

Edit: I blocked them for continuing to change what I am trying to talk about and ignoring what I was saying‚Ä¶.this wasn‚Äôt a discussion it was the other user talking at me.

Edit for the person below; I hope you get the help you need friend ‚ù§Ô∏è
Turn based combat is a very heavy mechanic in pokemon, but I dont really see it as a defining feature at all and is incredibly boring and dated imho
    bro turn based combat is like, a hallmark of many s-tier rpg's lol. that's like saying fps is boring and dated because its a heavy mechanic in doom/wolfenstein. (for the record i'm not dissing you for disliking turn based combat, i see what you're getting at)
        I don't think they were saying that turn-based combat ***in general*** is boring and dated, but rather that ***Pokemon's*** turn-based combat is boring and dated... which is accurate, IMO. They really haven't changed it all that much from the original Pokemon games.
            Mmm fair point lol. Pokemon‚Äôs rigid formula is incredibly stale and I haven‚Äôt fully played through one since sword/shield, which i found exceedingly disappointing
            Because it's a solid system and doesn't have to change. If you e played competitive pokemon you'll see that pokemons turn based gameplay is actually very intense, turn by turn reads and plays are wild. If you're into chess and card games, competitive pokemon would be right up your alley. 

What the games need are better stories, better AI, and higher difficulty. And even then, the latest DLC actually gave us an entire zone where every battle was a double battle with the NPCs using real items and strats, they're getting there finally.
    Turn based combat as a whole will never be ‚Äúdated‚Äù what are you smoking? 

People care about their joints; we can‚Äôt just play button smashing action games all the time. That‚Äôs how you get carpal tunnel
        I don't mind turn based combat in abstract 2d games but with the modern 3d style of new pokemon games it's pathetic
            Why?

Edit: *is it ‚Äúpathetic‚Äù*
    Lol there is a global level tournament for pokemon battling, it is the basis of how the card game works, it's what the anime is based on, it is the core gameplay system of the series for almost 30 years...


How is that NOT a defining feature? You can think it's boring and you're welcome to your opinion but it's a silly stance to take as truth. Is chess boring? Hasn't changed its gameplay in actual centuries yet it's still the most recognized boardgame/strategy game in the world? Is LoL boring for not having changed its gameplay in the 15 years since its release?

YOU might not care for it and that's a fine opinion to have, same as I don't care for shooters. But let's not live in our own mental canon where mainline pokemon games ARENT DEFINED by their turn based strategy elements. That's like saying main Mario games arent defined by their platforming elements. It's a silly take.

It's not boring, it's not dated. It's actually very intense, takes a lot of practice and game knowledge to be good at and has a rich strategic elements. Again you don't have to love it but calling it boring and dated is like calling chess boring and dated.
You can deny it as long as you want, but the majority of people who bought it love pokemon and are keen to see the more adult pokemon world, meanwhile pokemon still tries to sanitise the whole enslaving creatures to cockfight aspect.
    Or majority bought it for the memes and don't engage in the vocal group that say "THIS IS WHAT POKEMON SHOULD BE LIKE"
        Like I said feel, free to deny it as long as you want
Eh. I've played multiple Pok√©mon games where I shot through with the same team for pretty much the entire game, ignoring the battle system.
    This is my beef with a lot of the newer Pokemon games tbh. Ever since they turned the exp share on permanently, you don‚Äôt really even have to try anymore for the most part. 

There are some good mods and stuff out there though where strategy is definitely still very important. And that does make for a much more engaging experience imo. 

I do love both Pokemon and Palworld but I agree that they give different vibes - at least when Pokemon is done right or is at a competitive level.
        You never really needed to use more than one pokemon. You could just overlevel one pokemon and then keep the rest as revive sacrifices.
its better than pokemon just deal with it they did what hey should have done palsworld should partner with digimon for their first cosmetic drop
That's the thing. Team building in palworld doesn't just revolve around the battling. You have to consider traversal, resource gathering and the environment and time of day. Not to mention the whole base team. If the battle system was the most important thing in Pok√©mon how come the anime, the card game, pokken, mystery dungeon, snap etc still feels like Pok√©mon

There is a lot of strategy. Tho the strategy is different. You have to think more on your feet. There isn't a pause to give you time to plan. Typings matter arguably more than in Pok√©mon because of the simplified type chart..
    There really isn't a lot of strategy. Game is piss easy, which isn't a bad thing, but you can go guns blazing and succeed more often than not lol



Half the stuff you listed is a bit of a reach. Traversal options don't require strategy. It boils down to use flier or use ground mount. Thats it. 


Hell, you can completely ignore type advantages and still win. It won't even be difficult.
>Palworld is entirely different because of this. There‚Äôs no strategy.

Pokemons strategy is exclusively type countering, pokemon also has potions which completely negate using any strategy. Which is fine because the game is designed that way.

Theres a reason why every pokemon game, if you exclusively use your starter you will go through every bad type match up gym completely out leveling them. Not to mention types don't even matter when you can learn adjacent type abilities.
    This was basically my strat as a kid. Went through every generation up to platinum just using my starter to burst through everything. 

Strategy: grass type? Charizard. Flying type? Charizard water type? Charizard

Except Fire Red, where I was possessed by the rat spirit and went through the game with 2 Rattata that never evolved.
So do you like Palworld still or not really. Genuine question.
Well by that logic Pokemon has no strategy either. You can steamroll through with just one move ignoring type altogether as long as you level a single mon enough. And that's exactly how I played it when I was a kid
I agree! By now I've played Palworld to level 45 with a bunch of friends, beating every single tower boss but Victor/Shadowbeak and capturing every single Alpha pal available. The combat system is fine for as long as shooting up bullets and rockets into pocket monsters seem funny to you. Gets boring really fast, specially if you're hoping to find any tactical approach. It all boils down to variance and design space.

It could be easily remedied by increasing the relevancy of Pal/move types and Unique Abilities. Something easily done and worked on given enough time to playtest and refine. 

For reference: 
ON POK√âMON Type advantage may go up to 4x or 400% move damage. 
Disadvantage may go down to 0.25x or 25% or even 0 (Type immunity)
STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) adds 50% of a move's power to its total power before calculation if it has the same typing as the user.

ON PALWORLD type advantage may go up to 1.4x or 140% move damage. That's 260% less upwards variance than pok√©mon.
Disadvantage goes down to 0.6x or 60% move damage. That's 45% less downwards variance than pok√©mon, 60% less if you consider the lack of immunity in Palworld. (although these numbers might not be precise, they might actually err to less)
STAB on Palworld also adds only 20% to a move's power before damage calc. (confirmed value) That's 30% less impactful than pok√©mon.

The result is a dumbed down version of the pok√©mon battle system requiring little care for choice and variance. Since its conception, pok√©mon gym leaders employ monotype team compositions SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED to give the player an edge by growing a cast with flexible offensive options, instead of grinding your head into a wall.

On Palworld, you can hop on a Ragnahawk or Pyrin with 4 Gobfin on bench and breeze your way through the ENTIRE game. Alternatively, dark-type Nocturnal Pyrin, Frostallion Noct, Helzephyr, Maraith or Nox (These all do the exact same thing. Really, search it up.) and the same Gobfin setup would work. You can easily optimize Palworld by having monotype teams, or teams entirely dedicated to boosting player attack and defense. Which is fine and dandy if it were only an option, and not the playstyle you're forced to take.


Some pok√©mon are allowed to have busted 600 total stats by possessing typing that's disadvantageous to common attacks in the game, such as Mega Scizor, Genesect, Kommo-o, Tyranitar. Alternatively even weak 500 stats are made battle viable through a combination of synergistic typing+ability, such as Eelektross, Spiritomb and Shedinja, having either no weaknesses or being immune to most offensive moves.

On Palworld, none of this would even matter, since damage variance on typing is negligible and there is no immunity for some reason. It's simply damage % stacking upon damage. You can just mash numbers against a wall and it will break, and that's the most if not only viable strategy. This implies a greatly limited design space and variety. New additions to the game will only have bigger and bigger stats with higher damage moves, since that's the only way to make Pals relevant. The current system is made to be powercrept when it could be so much more.

It doesn't help that there is a grand variety of 137 Pals counting environmental variants, with 75% of the "unique" Abilities providing one thing and one thing only: % damage boost. no immunity to anything (such as Lightning Rod or Flash Fire). no speed boost. no speeding up cast time. no conditions to acquire higher stats (such as Guts or Moxie). no applying negative effects (such as Intimidate). no weather effects (such as Sandstream, Drought, Drizzle, etc you get the gist.) Just pure unconditional damage increase. Basically all battle-oriented pals have fucking Huge Power and you can mount on them sometimes. Even then, the most exquisite mount abilities such as active rocket launchers and firethrowers actually just suck, they're extremely underwhelming: completely defeating the purpose of the game's "rule of cool". Seriously think about how cool would be a Pal with weather altering abilities, bringing upon a rain or thunderstorm when it's summoned. Instead we have "Generic Partner Skill Name #78: Boost type damage". or "Generic Partner Skill Name #110: Apply type damage".
    You competely ignore the fact that in virtually every Pok√©mon game, you can literally get through the entire game if you just use your starter the entire time. Many people point out this is what they did as a kid, myself included. Pok√©mon games require no tactical approach unless you actively introduce it yourself (something I unconsciously started doing myself on later runs/games by purposely swapping out my starter).
    TL;DR: Palworld is very simplified and basic in combat design (active/passive/unique skills & typings) meaning there‚Äôs very little strategy, even in team building.

You got me with the ‚ÄúBasically all battle-oriented mons have fucking huge power.‚Äù I never saw it like that until you pointed it out.

I also realized that, because any Pal can learn any move, any meta will always boil down to having multiple of the same Pal on your team. Let‚Äôs say you don‚Äôt care about unique skills, Pal A has the highest base attack stat in the game. You would want to use Pal A in multiple forms because STAB doesn‚Äôt matter and move pools don‚Äôt matter. Why would you use Pal B with a lower base attack stat when Pal A does literally the same thing (again, ignoring Unique Skills)? I don‚Äôt think the unique skills are good enough for you to pass up Pal A for Pal B.
    A very in depth explanation of why this game is too easy.
IV is Roman numeral 4, yes, but he's talking about "Individual Values" or IVs.
    ...

I would have literally never figured that out without help... and yet... i STILL don't know what that means. The individual value thing...

https://preview.redd.it/mspi5hpkh6jc1.png?width=1169&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=93b4123c55ee9d8e688154581c216a84e684fc5d
        Pokemon define their stats by base stats + IVs. IVs are stats that are added to the pokemon each level depending on what kind of pokemon you have battled and gained exp from. Some pokemon will give you attack, some defence and some speed etc.. When you breed two pokemon the offspring will have bonuses depending on the parents' IV, I don't know exactly how that works mechanically but that's what "IV Breeding" means
            Damn. I never knew this a thing. Thanks for teaching me about it. ![img](emote|t5_4jn9v4|49342)
        Individual Values means that every Pokemon and Pal has a range of stats it can have.  
  
Not every Grizzbolt will have the same HP, Atk, and Def even if they have the same passives.
> Nintendo wants the game squeaky clean because they have always put themselves first and foremost as a family company. 

Well, most of the time anyway. For Bayonetta 2 the Link costume originally [had no cleavage at all](https://www.siliconera.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/cho_009.jpg), because Platinum Games was worried about exactly that squeaky clean attitude. However, when they took the designs of the Link, Peach, and Samus costumes to Nintendo for approval Nintendo [asked them to add cleavage to the Link outfit](https://www.siliconera.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/20141024_014750.png).
That last group you mentioned is most likely the biggest part of the Pok√©mon audience. Those that play the games a bit maybe finish the main story.
    Yeah completely agree. It‚Äôs a smaller percent of people sure, but we generally play the games dozens of times through in different ways or have much much longer playthroughs. It‚Äôs also a much higher percent of people playing it year long instead of when the game releases or every few years when they have the urge to
        Which is why palworld is exciting because it's an evolving world. It's not locked in place. I can come back in 6 months and the game could have changed alot. If I come back to scarlet and violet i get to pay $30 bucks for a couple hours of new stuff. And then wait a year for the next $60 game drop
            Yeah, I‚Äôm super excited for the future, 60 hours for a 30 dollar game is already worth it to me, I‚Äôm sure in the future, especially with modding, this will be a multi 100 hour game
Yeah Palworld doesn't give me the same feeling at all. I'm not a competitive player by any means but sometimes come back to play some of the more challenging firered rom hacks. 

The main problem with the Pokemon main series for me is the difficulty. You only really scratch the surface of the combat mechanics because the game is so easy. 

Another one is content. They had some neat mechanics like the Pokemon contests. Wish they would extend on stuff like that.
They're not meant to be compared directly lol, see this is why people say yall suck the fun out of everything. There's plenty of strategy in it's own right. Choosing the right pals/techniques for an encounter makes it much easier, is that not strategy to you? Just bc you can do more in the moment than stand around giving commands doesn't mean it's not strategic. And nuzlockers would live it. I'm doing a no catch run rn where I'm going through the journey without crafting or using a single sphere. Shiny hunters would enjoy the hunts for lucky and Alt types, and I'd love to hear about these other categories bc it sounds like you're just moving goalposts for the sake of not being wrong.
    ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not meant to be compared directly‚Äù

Ok so I‚Äôm right and it‚Äôs not what we‚Äôve been waiting for this whole time lol, if they aren‚Äôt comparable than it‚Äôs not what we waited for it
        No you're just deluded and think you speak for the community as a whole, which your ass backwards opinions contradict. I don't know a single pokemon fan that isn't absolutely insufferable as a human being that doesn't think this game is cool. You can be triggered all you want but yes the majority of Pmon fans think palworld is awesome lol.
            I‚Äôve literally said multiple times I don‚Äôt speak for the majority? Just a large group of people lol, just stop, I‚Äôm not responding anymore to this needless agression
You‚Äôve got such a rage boner that you‚Äôre conflating everything i‚Äôve said. I‚Äôm done talking at you, if you want discourse i‚Äôll come back later when you‚Äôve had your juice box and chill out.
The lore, loosely from what I‚Äôve gathered, is that the island used to be ruled by the legends. People and pals lived in harmony. The tower bosses are the leaders of the various groups that changed the landscape by outcasting the legends and humans alike and taking power for themselves. This is why there‚Äôs relatively few unallied humans and the legends live off in their little corners.
I mean, it's something to do.
    Tis true. Y'all have fun with that king
Yup. It's cause servers run all the time
I think that would be a bad move personally
    Don't want caves or underwater bioms?
        I do but I still want the option to fly over water. Maybe I misunderstood
Tbh they should just make your flying pal go back into its ball if they ‚Äúland‚Äù over water while mounted in order to make water pals more useful
    Not from just landing on water, but maybe if they run out of stamina and fall onto water.
i mean, tons of people play ark in third person. i'm not making any definitive assumptions on gameplay until we see gameplay footage or their marketing ramps up.
Are you sure about that? I don't think they ever said anywhere ARK 2 *wouldn't* be survival craft, but they said it would have more soulsy on-foot combat, which doesn't mean a survival craft is dead. But idk.
    Well im sure its gonna still have survival crafting, but last I checked they were focusing on 3rd person souls like exploration/combat which is absolutely different than what we have in ARK:SE/A Which is unique
Literally the only relation it has is that it's cute creatures caught in balls and it's open world. Totally different concept otherwise if you ask me. The similarities are numerous but it's really not as similar as alot of people say. (I'll admit I've accidentally called some pals by the Pokemon they look similar to
Pulling Pals defensively to avoid attacks is also something to be mindful of during a fight.
I would claim that ‚ÄúSubbing‚Äù in this game is not a ‚Äústrategy‚Äù. All you think is ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to get hit better recall my pal‚Äù. It‚Äôs a test of your timing skill, not your critical thinking skill

While Subbing in pokemon is deciding to give your opponent an immediate benefit, so that you can gain a future benefit; that is strategy
    Eh, it's still boiling back to live vs turn based, in a live pokemon battle you also wouldn't have time to map a strategy like you do in turnbased, it's tennis vs chess.

Edit: not sure why you blocked me after last reply but OK lol
        
Then open world pokemon game will still be turn based, just like Arcues/Scarlet/violet‚Ä¶what‚Äôs your point?

Edit: I blocked them for continuing to change what I am trying to talk about and ignoring what I was saying‚Ä¶.this wasn‚Äôt a discussion it was the other user talking at me.

Edit for the person below; I hope you get the help you need friend ‚ù§Ô∏è
bro turn based combat is like, a hallmark of many s-tier rpg's lol. that's like saying fps is boring and dated because its a heavy mechanic in doom/wolfenstein. (for the record i'm not dissing you for disliking turn based combat, i see what you're getting at)
    I don't think they were saying that turn-based combat ***in general*** is boring and dated, but rather that ***Pokemon's*** turn-based combat is boring and dated... which is accurate, IMO. They really haven't changed it all that much from the original Pokemon games.
        Mmm fair point lol. Pokemon‚Äôs rigid formula is incredibly stale and I haven‚Äôt fully played through one since sword/shield, which i found exceedingly disappointing
        Because it's a solid system and doesn't have to change. If you e played competitive pokemon you'll see that pokemons turn based gameplay is actually very intense, turn by turn reads and plays are wild. If you're into chess and card games, competitive pokemon would be right up your alley. 

What the games need are better stories, better AI, and higher difficulty. And even then, the latest DLC actually gave us an entire zone where every battle was a double battle with the NPCs using real items and strats, they're getting there finally.
Turn based combat as a whole will never be ‚Äúdated‚Äù what are you smoking? 

People care about their joints; we can‚Äôt just play button smashing action games all the time. That‚Äôs how you get carpal tunnel
    I don't mind turn based combat in abstract 2d games but with the modern 3d style of new pokemon games it's pathetic
        Why?

Edit: *is it ‚Äúpathetic‚Äù*
Lol there is a global level tournament for pokemon battling, it is the basis of how the card game works, it's what the anime is based on, it is the core gameplay system of the series for almost 30 years...


How is that NOT a defining feature? You can think it's boring and you're welcome to your opinion but it's a silly stance to take as truth. Is chess boring? Hasn't changed its gameplay in actual centuries yet it's still the most recognized boardgame/strategy game in the world? Is LoL boring for not having changed its gameplay in the 15 years since its release?

YOU might not care for it and that's a fine opinion to have, same as I don't care for shooters. But let's not live in our own mental canon where mainline pokemon games ARENT DEFINED by their turn based strategy elements. That's like saying main Mario games arent defined by their platforming elements. It's a silly take.

It's not boring, it's not dated. It's actually very intense, takes a lot of practice and game knowledge to be good at and has a rich strategic elements. Again you don't have to love it but calling it boring and dated is like calling chess boring and dated.
Or majority bought it for the memes and don't engage in the vocal group that say "THIS IS WHAT POKEMON SHOULD BE LIKE"
    Like I said feel, free to deny it as long as you want
This is my beef with a lot of the newer Pokemon games tbh. Ever since they turned the exp share on permanently, you don‚Äôt really even have to try anymore for the most part. 

There are some good mods and stuff out there though where strategy is definitely still very important. And that does make for a much more engaging experience imo. 

I do love both Pokemon and Palworld but I agree that they give different vibes - at least when Pokemon is done right or is at a competitive level.
    You never really needed to use more than one pokemon. You could just overlevel one pokemon and then keep the rest as revive sacrifices.
There really isn't a lot of strategy. Game is piss easy, which isn't a bad thing, but you can go guns blazing and succeed more often than not lol



Half the stuff you listed is a bit of a reach. Traversal options don't require strategy. It boils down to use flier or use ground mount. Thats it. 


Hell, you can completely ignore type advantages and still win. It won't even be difficult.
This was basically my strat as a kid. Went through every generation up to platinum just using my starter to burst through everything. 

Strategy: grass type? Charizard. Flying type? Charizard water type? Charizard

Except Fire Red, where I was possessed by the rat spirit and went through the game with 2 Rattata that never evolved.
You competely ignore the fact that in virtually every Pok√©mon game, you can literally get through the entire game if you just use your starter the entire time. Many people point out this is what they did as a kid, myself included. Pok√©mon games require no tactical approach unless you actively introduce it yourself (something I unconsciously started doing myself on later runs/games by purposely swapping out my starter).
TL;DR: Palworld is very simplified and basic in combat design (active/passive/unique skills & typings) meaning there‚Äôs very little strategy, even in team building.

You got me with the ‚ÄúBasically all battle-oriented mons have fucking huge power.‚Äù I never saw it like that until you pointed it out.

I also realized that, because any Pal can learn any move, any meta will always boil down to having multiple of the same Pal on your team. Let‚Äôs say you don‚Äôt care about unique skills, Pal A has the highest base attack stat in the game. You would want to use Pal A in multiple forms because STAB doesn‚Äôt matter and move pools don‚Äôt matter. Why would you use Pal B with a lower base attack stat when Pal A does literally the same thing (again, ignoring Unique Skills)? I don‚Äôt think the unique skills are good enough for you to pass up Pal A for Pal B.
A very in depth explanation of why this game is too easy.
...

I would have literally never figured that out without help... and yet... i STILL don't know what that means. The individual value thing...

    Pokemon define their stats by base stats + IVs. IVs are stats that are added to the pokemon each level depending on what kind of pokemon you have battled and gained exp from. Some pokemon will give you attack, some defence and some speed etc.. When you breed two pokemon the offspring will have bonuses depending on the parents' IV, I don't know exactly how that works mechanically but that's what "IV Breeding" means
