[[Palworld is the epitome of ‚ÄúWe have Pok√®mon at home‚Äù]]





Wth did they do to xatu?!
    You mean toucannon?
        Infinite fusion: xatoucannon
            That sounds like really anime move
            Tbh it would be more like xaannon/xannon or toucatu or toucatu if we were to go by normal infinite fusion naming standards but they could make a special exception to make it at least xacannon or smtn which sounds cool enough.
                You're right but i wish theyed do more like this where you can fully connect two names like lego and it just works spelling and phonetically.
                    It's kinda hard to do that when you have hundreds of Pok√©mon tho i think something happened with mr mime cuz normally it'd be "mr M" plus something else but it's just mr so we can have mr pedo or mr ee/mr vee
                    *they'd
    They put it through an ai generator¬†
    They improved it. I would actually use that one.
    Made him better
        Ain‚Äôt no way you said Xatu is bad
            Yes and I will die on this hill before I ever say he‚Äôs good
                I respect your will, but despise your opinion
                    That‚Äôs fine
                You're just mad he's smarter and better looking than you
                    No he just freaks me out
            Nah I dont think Xatu is bad, but I still think they improved it in pal world üòå /s
        I will not stand for this xatu island (I do like the high dodo tho)
        Xatu is perfect the way it is! I'll defend xatu to the moon and back
    I do really like the obese electabuzz tho.
    Make it a bomb
Wrong comparison for eevee should be Cremis not Vixy
    Just looked that one up and you're right lol.  It's literally just Eevee with neck fur üòÇ
        Shiny gigantimax Eevee
    Cremis is literally the fusion of an Eevee and a Wooloo
        With Zubat's ears
    Yep it's adorable but it's blatantly just eevee
    He really should lmao
    look at nox its just eevee with a cloak
4 is also Electavire, 5 is also Meowstic, and 6 is also Goodra.
    7 mearnie
    6 could also be Quagsire if you use the water variant of Relaxaurus
Temtem tried to make their creatures. Palworld looks like they put a Pokemon name in an AI generator.
    They probably did. The CEO of the dev company is all over ai and they've made a couple games with pretty heavy ai use before, so while they haven't admitted to having robots do all the work for them here, it's entirely possible that they did.

This is the slop that we'll see more of in future if we let generative AI become the norm in the industry.
        I swear we need to make using AI for video games and movies illegal or something..
            To be fair, there's no proof that it was used for this one. Just that the guy in charge really likes it and I'm not particularly willing to trust him.

Also, admittedly, there are some pretty unique designs here and there.
        Definitely not terrible. I have seen some unique pals in the game but I do agree less ai could be used. Sure, ai for a design base but then a person should edit the design to make it less weird.
            Agreed
    Because they literally did
        AI: How similar to pokemon do you want this game to be

CEO: Yes
        Source?
            The CEO of the company said so on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/imZaytri/status/1748432267792547987) and detailed the process by which he did it.
                Those don't look like the creatures in the game, and as far as I'm aware, they can't be, because they said that all of the art was done by a single new hire. This tweet shows that the CEO decided to make a post about messing around with AI generated fakemon, but I highly doubt they would go so far as to put that into their game. Although it's entirely possible that they did, but right now it's just a theory.
                    Unfortunately you're gonna get downvoted by all the losers who can't validate info.

Some people pointed out the CEO talked about possibilities with AI but literally nothing shows it was used in the game.

Like bro, people were ripping off designs DECADES before AI was a thing.

Also pretty sure even saw an interview or something around where the CEO talked about them expanding their studio by a good amount for Palworld and most was art team.

Like they ripped off Pokemon designs (though honestly like half of the ones OP put are stretches lmao) but you don't need AI to do that.

I'm not even into Palworld much. It plays like Ark which is a game I can never really get into.
                    Well I don't think the CEO of the company that hire was working at lauding the power of AI gets that hire out of the woods just yet
    Temtem literally only has like 2/3 good designs the rest is shit. Also the switch version i unhappily bought is dogshit. Every 30 min it crashes which makes it worst than Scarlet/Violets optimization so no wonder they aren't as successful as palworld. I agree Palworld looks more than just "inspired" but Temtems look more AI created.

Well seems it isn't AI created like all you losers thought https://twitter.com/ttvPalmer/status/1749992787016053102?t=CHQ-JsUzm0ffS3Fy2HDZLg&s=19
        The platupus
            The platypus was a popular Fakemon ‚Äústarter leak‚Äù before TemTem was made, so TemTem bought the rights from the artist for the platypus because it was popular.

That‚Äôs like, the one thing I knew about TemTem before it blew up after the SwSh controversy lol.
                Yeah, people thought it was the real-deal Pokemon starter since it was popular back in 2018. It's cool that someones work was put into a game.
            It looks ai af and yes i know it's from someone who made a pkmn "fanart"
                People thought it was an actual starter so I dont think its ai
                Well considering the Platypus was around years before Midjourney, Dall-E, Craiyon, etc., I doubt it
They look like AI Pok√©mon with a bit of cleanup
    They probably are, considering the company‚Äôs history.
    They are. Pocketpair's CEO talked about how they did it on [twitter](https://twitter.com/imZaytri/status/1748432267792547987)
        That's just an image of them showing off AI generated fakemon. Saying that the CEO admitted to using AI for that game is extremely misinformative, because he actually didn't say that at all, he said that it was all done by a single person. Granted, a single person who he also admitted "applied to hundreds of game dev studios and never got hired" which is extremely suspicious, but you can't just twist their words like that.
            The applying part isn‚Äôt that suspicious, game dev is a super competitive industry, especially if he‚Äôs just talking about a concept artist, rather than the modeler (I would be shocked if there wasn‚Äôt a modeling team of at least 3, modeling can‚Äôt be AI generated yet).
        Augh
Zangoose‚Äôs boi looks like Snorlax and Electabuzz got their cousin from Chicago to come beat you in a dark alleyway

        Ooh! Boondocks reference, very nice
            Lemme remind you, that man is free to roam the streets atm
They kind of look AI generated, especially the one that is apparently Lopunny
    The developers used AI to 'make' the pals.
        proof
            [Here you go.](https://twitter.com/imZaytri/status/1748432267792547987)

                    This is reddit, of course they didn't
        Is that a hard fact? Or are we just assuming because they‚Äôve openly admitted to being ok with using AI?
            [Here's](https://twitter.com/imZaytri/status/1748432267792547987) Pocketpair's CEO admitting to using gnerative AI in Palworld.
                I love spreading misinformation on the internet
                Thanks, that‚Äôs all I was asking. I hadn‚Äôt seen anything on it
There is a pal that's eevee but fluffyer
    It's more cat likd tho? The eyes and colour around the face are quite different too
Wow They didn‚Äôt even try to hide it.
I heard questionable things, but it's *THIS* obvious*?* Holy shit...
Yeah, its pretty blatantly a rip-off and not a reference
Why do people suddenly care about palworld again
    It just recently released in Early Access on Steam and Game Pass on Xbox
    It came out and is 1000x better and more fun than Pok√©mon has been in years lol
        I'm still not playing it because, 1. I don't trust the company from what I heard. 2. Just look at the monsters and tell me they aren't AI generated Pok√©mon.
            Don‚Äôt trust them to do or not do what?
                From what I've heard they abandoned the Xbox version of their last game and kept the PC version up to date. If you play Xbox I do suggest you don't buy it.
                    That makes sense. But to be honest the vast majority of people playing this on Xbox are just playing it through GamePass, which they‚Äôre already paying for. But I agree, I wouldn‚Äôt pay $30 for it if I didn‚Äôt already have access to it through some other means
            Look at 90% of the Paldea dex and tell me they aren't ai generated¬†
                how do they look ai generated tf?
                    Gouging Fire looks like somebody told an ai to generate a Triceratops¬†
                        Gouging fire looks cool tho what?
                            Gouging Fire looks fucking horrible. Also glad to see ai art is ok as long as it's "cool" lol
                                It‚Äôs literally not ai dumbass
                                    Neither is Palworld. Plus Pok√©mom has gotten in trouble a few times for using ai art in their games lol
                <10% look AI generated and it's a stretch.
                    Well actually if you subscribe to Imagination Theory then all the Paradox mons were created by the AI professors ü§ì
        Pok√©mon-Ark is definitely peak. Couldn‚Äôt put it down yesterday and I definitely agree with some aspects but it definitely is truer to Ark than Pok√©mon.
    Because it's sold 5 million copies in 3 days since releasing on gamepass.
    Gameplay loop is really tight for an indie game
What about wooloo and lamball
    brother those are sheep, of all the examples you could've used you decide to use the one where the inspiration is a fucking sheepüíÄüíÄüíÄ
I feel like Pok√©mon designs in general just feel different idk why
How has Nintendo not sued them out of existence yet? Like, on the list of bad ideas, playing copyright chicken with Nintendo is up there with attacking a US ship.
    Honestly, a shame it came from a company with that sorta history. But for what it is, its one of the more entertaining pokemon ripoffs. 


And though its fucking sad as hell to state this as a pro. Atleast they arent falsely advertising footage from pokemon fan games to pass off their game as something better than it is like 90% of the ripoffs.
    They can‚Äôt, the palworld devs have added just enough in the exact right areas to avoid copyright infringement. You can‚Äôt copyright an idea, mechanic, or artstyle, and palworld doesn‚Äôt use the name ‚ÄúPok√©mon‚Äù or the names or designs of any official Pok√©mon.

They‚Äôre basically going ‚Äúna-na, you can‚Äôt sue me!‚Äù
    They wouldn‚Äôt win
Don't forget the Walmart brand luxray and Lucario. This game looks so disappointing lol. It was a good idea, but they apparently refused to do any original work
    And yet people are praising sooo
[deleted]
    [deleted]
        The slavery is completely optional and illegal in-game. Just like the capturing of humans and the selling of their body parts (yes, you can do that).
            WHAT THE F?!!!!!!!!!1111!!!!
            >Just like the capturing of humans and selling of their body parts

Hold up. Wait a minute...
                I'm not joking.
            Now, you got my attention :D
            Hello??? Based department?
            freak you
8's literally just a grass type Cinderace, down to the very minute detail!
    Fucker went from Cinderace to Chlorogoal
number 4 is an upgrade or should i say dope consepts for a evo
Some of these are more of an improvement imo
Holy fuck some of these aren't even close what drugs are you pokemon fans on jesus
not ampy
the 4th one is also dollar store totoro from ghibli
This is a stretch.
Last one is a fusion with xatu and toucannon
5 feels like Echo from Overwatch.
Look how they massacred my boy!
nah that ampharos knockoff is so damn ugly
    It's not even similar
What's the name of that 5th one for... research purposes.
    *Not* Lopunny
they are playing with fire, better hope nintendo doesn't catch on soon,  since the only defense they have is that you can beat the monsters up with sticks and stuff before catching them
    The gameplay loop isn't actually an issue. You can't copyright genres or gameplay. The Pal designs are what could lead to issues.
at least its actually a different genre unlike temtem
Think youre wrong on the "inspiration" for the one with evee and belossom but i agree with the others. Anyway, time to go into battle with a team of civilians.
    Amphoras's Palmon "coungerpart" isn't rveb close either tbh
This is why I'm never playing this game..it looks dumb, sounds dumb, and is literally stupid asf
wait until the cease and decist
    Not gonna happen. There‚Äôs a chance it‚Äôll be attempted, but it won‚Äôt go anywhere

Microsoft wouldn‚Äôt have paid this developer to have the game on GamePass if they thought Nintendo had any legal rights to take this game down‚Ä¶
        >it won‚Äôt go anywhere

Tell that to the Nintendo Ninjas.


/j
Ngl I prefer the ampthros and the balossom ones more
    Ampharos is goated. That thing is an abomination
        In my opinion ampharos is over rated would prefer it if it looked more like a sheep the pal world one Is a silly little guy
        Same. Too bad he isn't actually a Dragon. Gen 6 ruined me.
    Yeah
Even though they clearly took heavy influence. Apparently the game itself is really fun and solid. And just hit gamepass. So that's on the books tonight üòÇ

Also the fact you can capture humans like the monsters is interesting ü§£
    Its pokemon with guns what more can someone want
        Oh definitely.

They just released a report saying that the sales and players have been so overwhelming they are having to do an emergency meeting with epic to try and save the servers ü§£
The Xatu one isnt bad, it just has the same concept.
not ampy
The zangoose one looks like a beta design people would find in the code or smth
I‚Äôm still smashing lopunny, even if it got fused with mewtwo
You forgot lovander vs Salazzle. Still a fire game though, even if everything was blatantly robbed from someone else.
Okay, some I do see, but others y‚Äôall are ABSOLUTELY stretching.
That second one is literally just a Japanese Folklore creature known as the Qilin. So The Pokemon Company owns that forever cause they did it first, except they didnt? Play the game its fantastic and has more effort put into it than the last 3 pokemon games.
They weren't hiding it, but I still like these pals too!
Every streamer who willingly played this game knowing all the controversy around it is going to act completely surprised when this company makes ai voice clones of them
    Why would they have to play this game to make AI voice clones? Why not just grab any recording of them playing any game? What a weird take
        Because they claim they own the rights to all footage of anyone playing their game so they can say they did it ethically
            Unless there‚Äôs a EULA that has to be agreed upon and ‚Äúsigned‚Äù before playing the game, that won‚Äôt hold up at all. If that‚Äôs the case, then more power to em. People don‚Äôt seem to care one way or another
It amazes me that our society is so uneducated that 2 MILLION people paid $30 for these AI generated hollow designs.
    > MILLION people *paid* $30 for

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

*Beep, boop, I'm a bot*
        Thank you bot
    Lol you should try it. Its incredibly fun and addicting.
    I know, I just don't care if a multibillion dollar company has their designs ripped off. I also think it's great that a large game is finally embracing AI.

Palworld does Pokemon better than Pokemon.
        I see your argument brought up a lot, and that's not the problem.

The problem isn't that they're stealing designs from a rich company, the problem is that the people who made the original designs were humans and artists with skill and passion. They put effort into this stuff for it to just be ripped away and Palworld claims it as their own.

Imagine you made your own Pokemon and then someone steals your drawing and says they made it. Doesn't seem very kind, does it?
            It's only unkind if you view it as unkind. Everyone seems to have this idea that taking something someone else made and using it yourself is somehow disrespectful, and I don't understand that at all. It doesn't harm the original creator in any way, especially if they were salaried. Meanwhile, the developers are able to put less time into making designs and more time into making the game since they're using designs that already exist.
                Excuse me, so stealing personal works and ideas is okay to you? Like if someone took an idea that you have, say it's theirs and sell it without you gaining anything?

And do you know that thing that is called plagiarism? You know, something that is illegall
                    >without you gaining anything?

Game Freak employees have already been compensated for their ideas. They get paid a salary. They are losing nothing.
                        They are not getting paid by Palword's creators, and they used the original creator's creations
                            They get paid the same whether Game Freak licenses out the designs or not.

Also, if palworld didn't exist, they wouldn't be getting anything from it anyway. So, they still aren't losing anything they otherwise would've had.
                                They are not getting what they deserve. Pok√©mon used their designs, they paid for them. Palword should do the same

If not, I could write the exact same story as, let's say, Shadowhunters, changing only the names of the characters and creatures, and sell it for the same price. Plagiarism? What is that?
                                    Maybe for the newer designs I'd agree with you, but a lot of older Pokemon designs are over 20 years old at this point. The original copyright law was 20 years, enough time to profit off of your idea before you need to come up with a new one. Then, Disney bribed Congress to extend copyright to ridiculous levels.

If it weren't for bribes, Gens 1, 2, and 3 would be public domain by now. Those designs are ethical to use.
            Has there been a single bit of proof anything was done with AI? I havent seen anything that actually proves its AI generated.
        I bet you also liked when that one company made Stan Lee NFTs.
    Clutch your pearls harder. This is no different than if this company looked at the Pok√©dex to draw their own creatures from the likeness of already existing Pok√©mon. The only difference is it‚Äôs a faster process.

Popular media has always been copied with ‚Äúa new twist‚Äù for monetary gain. There are legitimate concerns when it comes to AI, but this isn‚Äôt one of them considering plagiarism will always be a problem wether or not AI exists
        If you legitimately don't see a difference between a person making derivative character designs and a computer mass producing them, then you don't know what art actually is, and your opinions are invalid.
            Sorry to break it to you, but I went to college for art. I have my bachelors degree in graphic design and an associate degree in fine art. My opinions are only invalid to you because you don‚Äôt like them
                If you're willing to throw all that away with the idea that what you make is conceivably no different than what a computer algorithm can spit out given enough attempts and enough stolen art fed into it, I don't even care. The idea that art doesn't have to be made by people is the most anti-art statement possible, and how dare you use your credentials as an artist to defend it. Scumbag.
                    Yes how dare I, oh the agony! Call me whatever you want. You‚Äôre so mad that I didn‚Äôt immediately condemn AI that you‚Äôre not even paying attention to what I‚Äôm saying, and instead are putting words in my mouth and making up narratives for me that I didn‚Äôt even bring about.

I never once said that art made by real people can‚Äôt be or isn‚Äôt distinguishable from what AI creates. I said that if people want to plagiarize art for their own monetary gain, they will, regardless of the existence of AI.

I‚Äôll say it again, there are very important and potentially devastating dilemmas that could be a world wide issue in regard to AI and its advancements, but plagiarizing art isn‚Äôt one of them.
                        You're just lying now. I can still read what you said earlier, and you did, in fact, say that a human artist plagiarizing existing material to produce something is no different from an AI program doing it. One is derivative art, the other isn't art, and if you don't see the difference, I stand by my assessment of you as scum.

What you're doing right now, regardless of whether it's purposeful or not, is smuggling procedural generation into the definition of art. It isn't and never can be. That is what's important right now; the devaluing of art into a product being made on a factory line. So arguing as you did that it doesn't matter if a popular game like this used AI to make its art assets is, actually, much worse than if they'd just copied the designs.

So yes, you are still anti-art regardless of your credentials as an artist.
                            Derivative art is created by literally copying pre existing material and making it sightly different or new. AI is doing **THE EXACT SAME THING!** So yes, you‚Äôre right, I‚Äôm saying human plagiarism is the same as AI plagiarism.

And on that note, who are you to say derivative art can only be created by people? What gives you the authority to tell someone what is or isn‚Äôt art? Art is meant to be interpreted by everyone in whatever way they see it. Just because you don‚Äôt see it as art doesn‚Äôt mean you have the right to tell others it‚Äôs not art. If you despise AI for stealing other art pieces to create its own, then you should have as much hate for people that do the same and call it derivative art‚Ä¶
        People drawing creatures based on Pok√©mon usually aren‚Äôt making money from it like palworld is
            I edited my comment to better convey what I was trying to prove. Re read my last comment
        Yeah you get down voted but honestly who cares. Sure there are hollow ways to use AI to make non substantial games, but if the game is good who the fuck cares how they did it. Imaging having fun in a game and later you find out that they used ai to create it... Now what??
            The problem is not that they used the ai to create game mechanics. The problem comes when it is used to copy paste creatures from other games, it is basically plagiarism and it should not get any type of acknowledgement
            That's like saying who cares if the meal you bought was stolen and the restaurant you paid didn't actually cook it.
>But if the game is good who the fuck cares how they did it

Anyone with a brain and a heart cares. We care whether or not the things we enjoy were created fairly and ethically. I don't want to give money to a studio that stole the art and passion of other humans. I don't want to support people that steal art and claim it as their own.

Do you understand my point?
                Not really. The fact that it's stolen art, yeah that's understandable to criticize. The fact that it was AI generated.. not at all. And I was talking about AI, not copyright.
Say what you want but palworld Cinderace and regular Cinderace would drink coffee together
This game is literally "pokemon but irl" like I feel like if pokemon existed in real life this is what would happen
I think it‚Äôs 50/50‚Ä¶ like Zatu‚Ä¶ who thw hell cares‚Ä¶ D Pok√©mon kept a D Pok√©mon‚Ä¶

Grass Cinderace is going to happen.

Bellosom is barely changed 

Ampharos is only odd one.

Buneary is like way more fury bate. But like mix between Meowstic (Pok√©mon waste) and buneary

Electric zangoose cool.

Also eevee no difference

Cooler deer 

And same sprite
Some of these are a stretch but the ones that are blatant are VERY blatant.
Most of these are a bit farfetch'd
The ampharos comparison is a bit of a stretch. they're just both yellow dinosaurs, and the lopunny esque one is just some failed character from an alien movie
I‚Äôm literally about to play palworld and no one is dissing it cause I heard I can give penguins weapons
Palworld is gonna be the thing to stop all poke-likes and i hate it
    "Poke-like" isn't a thing you mean monster catching games, cuz pokemon sure as fuck didn't invent that genre not every monster catching game is a rip off
        It poke-like because its meant to be like rouge-like
            Again not a thing I've literally never heard that term before yesterday when you said it, if anything pokemon clone is more common of a term eveb if the term is just outright wrong in alot of cases like with digimon, and Dragon quest monsters being called rip-offs when they arent
Except this game has guns and organ harvesting
It‚Äôs supposed to be Pok√©mon with guns
Ngl some are cooler
Still a better game than SV
Some of them i would give a pass, like the bellossom one since it's more poison ivy like and such rather than straight up bellossom copycat.
The ampharos looking one is just a generic cartoony lizard, i can't expect much from smth so simple. Though it was definitely "inspired" (copied by AI) by Ampharos.
WAIT, IT CAME OUT?? WHEN?? WHY HAVEN'T I SEEN IT???
What did they do to my dad üò≠it‚Äôs like a combo of Blaziken and my dad but less cool üò≠
Pokemon...with machine guns, and black jack.....and hookers.... thats basicly my take on palworld
Not gonna lie some of these designs are actually pretty good
 But guns üòà
Kid:Mom can please get the new Pok√©mon game
Mom:no son we have the pokeymans at home
The Pok√©mon at home in question:
A lot of the Pal designs are direct rip-offs of Pokemon, but where it really thrives is the gameplay. (And the not shitty graphics)
Ngl I had much more fun on it than SV. Not more than LA tho
Okay you're taking the piss with the Ampharos one
would
Atleast Palworld reliably performs well(from what I've heard)
On one hand, its a ripoff, from a company that has slightly more integrity than the occasional pokemon ripoff devs that advertize their mobile game on youtube with stolen footage from a fan game to sell it. Which isnt saying much.


On the other hand, most of pokemons money comes from merch and (though i doubt this would even be competition for pokemon games in its current state) and given the whole craftopia thing. I dont expect it to go any further (just setting the bar low.)


But i like the game and i hope it either.
1: wins the inevitable lawsuit and (i know its a stretch) either gets gamefreak to put their old games on the eshop (yellow -white) or encourages them to start making pokemon games for not just nintendo.
2: doesnt get sued into oblivion and it actually gets the support to grow into something even better.


I like pokemon but i wish there were other options that i didnt have to have different consoles because they dont want to make their old games backwards compatible.

And anyone worried this will harm pokemon in some way.


.... Seriously? You think the company that makes billions off a yellow mouse (holy fuck its almost japanese disney, i just realized) cant take a hit on their monopoly of animal fighting game?
None of these seem too similar. I was kinda worried when people were calling it a knock off cause its genuinely a fantastic game. Pokemon has been around for like 3 decades, i could make someone wholly original to me and it could be called a copy of a pokemon at this point. Can nobody else make a monster catching game cause pokemon has made a bunch of pokemon?
Pokemon fans when they learn that some colors match other better then others

Pokemon fans when they find out rabbits exist

Pokemon fans when they find  out dogs/cats exist
    Are you actually defending the cinderace one?

And the cobalion one?
    I could see where you are coming from, except for Cinderace and Cobalion. Fake Cinderace has the same soccer bottoms effect, as well as the socks and the separating part. The hands also match up. Fake Cobalion has the same body shape and similar animal features as well as the same colouration (blue body, white tuft, brown-orange horn). The rest aren‚Äôt as bad for me, but still feel at least heavily influenced by Pokemon.
        Iq only agree with cobalion
    Yeah, they probably copied it but they still are original
i only see cobalion ngl, the others add enough for me to consider them original
Palworld designs are still pretty nice, though..
Who gives a shit, this is an immensely better product than anything GAMEFREAK has put out as of recently, with the exception to Legends Arceus.
    "Who cares if it breaks the law. I like this thing more than the one affected by it."
        You‚Äôre now twisting my words to a false narrative.
            Nope. I simply restated what you said to be more overt. Copyright violations are wrong regardless of how you feel about a company and its products. Ignoring the issue because you like the new product is weird.
                Quite frankly I have yet to try this game out but from what my colleagues say, it seems more promising than what TPC has provided in recent history. 

I still hold the Pok√©mon franchise to a special place in my heart but I can‚Äôt be pretending I still enjoy it, SV is proof of that, especially quality-wise.
                    >it seems more promising than what TPC has provided in recent history. 

And that's fine. I agree honestly. However, I have no idea why they decided to walk a fine line with IPs considering how aggressive Nintendo and the Pokemon brand are about protecting their assets. It just unnecessarily puts a solid looking game at risk.
                        It would be quite interesting to see how this would fare, surely will have its pros and cons. Whatever happens, happens.
[removed]
    Maybe if you like survival games as a genre
        [removed]
            No not really, for two reasons:

1: Opinions cannot be objective 

2: They are different types of open world games. SV are story games, and PW is a survival game. They are completely different styles of games and comparing them is the same as comparing Ark and Pok√©mon.
            The open world is definitely more visually appealing, I just enjoyed what I was doing in SV more than Palworld. Want more depth to the monster battles themselves. Palworlds creature collecting depth is built into the automation of the survival game aspects.
    i agree üíñ
    Just so you know you're not alone in believing that, I agree.
To be fair the yellow one is like a mix between Electivire and Zangoose. And I like their version of Cobalion more
The xatu was wildüòÇ
On an unrelated note, what's the name of that Grass Lady character?
Tbh Palworld is better than every new Pok√©mon game except PLA
Seriously they didnt even try to be original, and then people have the nerve to call us crybabies for complaining about something like this even though its a total rip-off.
When you have 1000+ designs of course parallels would be drawn, 

All media is inherently derivative
    Yeah but not all media is stolen and AI regenerated to avoid a lawsuit.

Well.. a lot is nowadays, but not all..
I saw the trailer for this and everything was just a ripoff pokemon. I might play it because I think it‚Äôs in the xbox gamepass
NGL I actually kinda prefer the fake xatu.
pokemon fans are angry because PalWorld is better LMAO
    Better in what way? Palworld is a survival game at the end of the day, and if you don't really like survival games, it's not a great creature collector on top of that gameplay loop.
    Most of us don't care which game is "better", we're angry that the Devs of palworld used AI generated Pokemon, and if you didn't know, the only way to make AI images is to steal from real artists and designs. So many of these 'pals' look like Pokemon/fakemon because the AI is just eating up the actual designs and spitting out this garbage.
Honestly don't care about it being ai since the game is pretty fun and I prefer some of the' rip-off' pokemon designs to the ones they supposedly are imitating(some not all). Game is fun, wish they gave a bit more guidance on what you're doing (definitely going with the ark influences) and how to do things but it still is good.
palworld is if pokemon was actually fun
    (I don't want to seem rude) Palword is a survival game, Pok√©mon is an RPG with creature collection. They are completely different things...
Number 4 is zangoose and electivire
    And Totoro.
        What
I swear I've seen the one on slide 5 in a comic
GODDAMN THAT LOPUNNY CLONE
Goofymon
hear me out on the lopunny one tho
Xatu is a derp
Direhowl is literally just lycanroc dawn
no way they ruined mah boi Deicudeye like that!
What are the names of the Cinderace and Lopunny bootleg?....
Ima say it i don‚Äôt care : smas‚Äî
So bad
number one also has blazakin‚Äôs legs
Oh and guns
The xatu cannot be more perfect. Also dam that lopunny tho ü•µ
number 5 lookin kinda‚Ä¶
The fifth and eighth ones are in the dangerous hands of the internet
I didn‚Äôt know Xatu had a derpy cousin.
Why'd they do my boy Ampharos like that üò≠
Do you want pikachu, snorlax or Zangoose

Y  E  S
Ngl some pf these look like fusions zangoose + electabuzz for 4 cinderace + any of the feminine grass types for 8 and xatu + toucannon for 9
dont ignore the meganium one
Ok but‚Ä¶ the ampharos knockoff is friend shaped. I would be ok with him becoming a real Pok√©mon. He‚Äôs just a little guy.
Of course Loppuny is still hot
They did WHAT to my boy cinderace?
The Ampharos One lol
We need some OP Animator to make Palword vs Pokemon!
R34 artists are gonna have a field day with the 5th slideüíÄ
ampharos is worse imo (just like the yellow guy's face)
Actually, there's one that looks even closer to Eevee, but is white and fluffier.
Surprised Nintendo hasn‚Äôt crept around yet lol you can definitely see the similarities.
Bristla‚Äôs hair reminds me more of Gossifleur than Bellossom
There's also one called lyleen wich is just liligent
Noo my fav poke.on zangoose got the worst treatment why the fuck is he fat
I'm in a group chat and they're all talking about it and I said it looks too ripoffy and they got mad at me for "defending the big corporation"
The third one looks more like Fennekin to me‚Ä¶ ü§î
"we have Pokemon at home"
"But they have guns..."
American trainers with pokemon that are made in China
Surprised Pok√©mon legal dept. wasn‚Äôt like ‚Äúnah fam‚Äù
Palworld is gonna be the thing to stop all poke-likes and i hate it
Who cares, the game looks fun
The Lopunny one looks like a Mewtwo fusion
Wouldn‚Äôt the Zangoose comparison fit electabuzz more
The fourth one is a fusion of zangoose and electabuzz
I'm surprised they didn't just give a Pok√©mon a rifle
I like the ampharos
So is no one else seeing gallade?
Lmao
I'll argue that Palworld has SOME original designs (which -may- have some derivative inspiration but it's better than what most are):

* Chikipi: it's a chicken.
* Gumoss: A slime made of tree sap with an acorn hat. Actually pretty cute.
* Gobfin: A shark goblin, I'm trying to find if there's any pokemon it's specifically derivative of.
* Cawgnito: The Plague Doctor bird I wanted. Pokemon gave us Rupaul bird
* Digtoise: A turtle with drill bits on its shell. Does not seem immediately derivative of an existing pokemon
* Tombat: Funny cat-bat thing, I actually like this guy a lot
* Kingpaca: While its headpiece is totally definitely not based on Empoleon, I like the rest of it a lot. You could also argue it's taking the colorscheme of Arcanine (Red with white fluff) but that's a little bit of a reach.
* Mammorest: Elephant covered in moss and stones. Seems original enough
* Eikthyrdeer: Some may point at Xerneas but other than being deer pokemon with big antlers I don't really see it
* Reindrix: See above with the Xerneas comparison.
* Penking: Another one people point at being a copycat of Empoleon but other than them both being blue penguins, there's nothing in common with them visually. if anything, Penking fits the Napoleon aesthetic more.
* Blazamut: I'm not seeing anything pokemon wise that's derivative. However I am getting Future Card Buddy Fight vibes...
* Woolipop: Okay so it probably has some aesthetics shared with Alcremie but I'll be honest, a cotton candy sheep is something I kind of expected by now.

One has to remember there's a difference between being inspired by the same general thing (Flambelle and Litwick are both candle themed, Fuddler and Drilbur are both moles) and deliberately designing a thing to copy something else (Sparkit quite literally has Raichu's tail)
I didn‚Äôt know Walmart had pokemon
The last one got me laughing
Hahha
You mean toucannon?
    Infinite fusion: xatoucannon
        That sounds like really anime move
        Tbh it would be more like xaannon/xannon or toucatu or toucatu if we were to go by normal infinite fusion naming standards but they could make a special exception to make it at least xacannon or smtn which sounds cool enough.
            You're right but i wish theyed do more like this where you can fully connect two names like lego and it just works spelling and phonetically.
                It's kinda hard to do that when you have hundreds of Pok√©mon tho i think something happened with mr mime cuz normally it'd be "mr M" plus something else but it's just mr so we can have mr pedo or mr ee/mr vee
                *they'd
They put it through an ai generator¬†
They improved it. I would actually use that one.
Made him better
    Ain‚Äôt no way you said Xatu is bad
        Yes and I will die on this hill before I ever say he‚Äôs good
            I respect your will, but despise your opinion
                That‚Äôs fine
            You're just mad he's smarter and better looking than you
                No he just freaks me out
        Nah I dont think Xatu is bad, but I still think they improved it in pal world üòå /s
    I will not stand for this xatu island (I do like the high dodo tho)
    Xatu is perfect the way it is! I'll defend xatu to the moon and back
I do really like the obese electabuzz tho.
Make it a bomb
Just looked that one up and you're right lol.  It's literally just Eevee with neck fur üòÇ
    Shiny gigantimax Eevee
Cremis is literally the fusion of an Eevee and a Wooloo
    With Zubat's ears
Yep it's adorable but it's blatantly just eevee
He really should lmao
look at nox its just eevee with a cloak
7 mearnie
6 could also be Quagsire if you use the water variant of Relaxaurus
They probably did. The CEO of the dev company is all over ai and they've made a couple games with pretty heavy ai use before, so while they haven't admitted to having robots do all the work for them here, it's entirely possible that they did.

This is the slop that we'll see more of in future if we let generative AI become the norm in the industry.
    I swear we need to make using AI for video games and movies illegal or something..
        To be fair, there's no proof that it was used for this one. Just that the guy in charge really likes it and I'm not particularly willing to trust him.

Also, admittedly, there are some pretty unique designs here and there.
    Definitely not terrible. I have seen some unique pals in the game but I do agree less ai could be used. Sure, ai for a design base but then a person should edit the design to make it less weird.
        Agreed
Because they literally did
    AI: How similar to pokemon do you want this game to be

CEO: Yes
    Source?
        The CEO of the company said so on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/imZaytri/status/1748432267792547987) and detailed the process by which he did it.
            Those don't look like the creatures in the game, and as far as I'm aware, they can't be, because they said that all of the art was done by a single new hire. This tweet shows that the CEO decided to make a post about messing around with AI generated fakemon, but I highly doubt they would go so far as to put that into their game. Although it's entirely possible that they did, but right now it's just a theory.
                Unfortunately you're gonna get downvoted by all the losers who can't validate info.

Some people pointed out the CEO talked about possibilities with AI but literally nothing shows it was used in the game.

Like bro, people were ripping off designs DECADES before AI was a thing.

Also pretty sure even saw an interview or something around where the CEO talked about them expanding their studio by a good amount for Palworld and most was art team.

Like they ripped off Pokemon designs (though honestly like half of the ones OP put are stretches lmao) but you don't need AI to do that.

I'm not even into Palworld much. It plays like Ark which is a game I can never really get into.
                Well I don't think the CEO of the company that hire was working at lauding the power of AI gets that hire out of the woods just yet
Temtem literally only has like 2/3 good designs the rest is shit. Also the switch version i unhappily bought is dogshit. Every 30 min it crashes which makes it worst than Scarlet/Violets optimization so no wonder they aren't as successful as palworld. I agree Palworld looks more than just "inspired" but Temtems look more AI created.

Well seems it isn't AI created like all you losers thought https://twitter.com/ttvPalmer/status/1749992787016053102?t=CHQ-JsUzm0ffS3Fy2HDZLg&s=19
    The platupus
        The platypus was a popular Fakemon ‚Äústarter leak‚Äù before TemTem was made, so TemTem bought the rights from the artist for the platypus because it was popular.

That‚Äôs like, the one thing I knew about TemTem before it blew up after the SwSh controversy lol.
            Yeah, people thought it was the real-deal Pokemon starter since it was popular back in 2018. It's cool that someones work was put into a game.
        It looks ai af and yes i know it's from someone who made a pkmn "fanart"
            People thought it was an actual starter so I dont think its ai
            Well considering the Platypus was around years before Midjourney, Dall-E, Craiyon, etc., I doubt it
They probably are, considering the company‚Äôs history.
They are. Pocketpair's CEO talked about how they did it on [twitter](https://twitter.com/imZaytri/status/1748432267792547987)
    That's just an image of them showing off AI generated fakemon. Saying that the CEO admitted to using AI for that game is extremely misinformative, because he actually didn't say that at all, he said that it was all done by a single person. Granted, a single person who he also admitted "applied to hundreds of game dev studios and never got hired" which is extremely suspicious, but you can't just twist their words like that.
        The applying part isn‚Äôt that suspicious, game dev is a super competitive industry, especially if he‚Äôs just talking about a concept artist, rather than the modeler (I would be shocked if there wasn‚Äôt a modeling team of at least 3, modeling can‚Äôt be AI generated yet).

            I love spreading misinformation on the internet
            Thanks, that‚Äôs all I was asking. I hadn‚Äôt seen anything on it
It's more cat likd tho? The eyes and colour around the face are quite different too
It just recently released in Early Access on Steam and Game Pass on Xbox
It came out and is 1000x better and more fun than Pok√©mon has been in years lol
    I'm still not playing it because, 1. I don't trust the company from what I heard. 2. Just look at the monsters and tell me they aren't AI generated Pok√©mon.
        Don‚Äôt trust them to do or not do what?
            From what I've heard they abandoned the Xbox version of their last game and kept the PC version up to date. If you play Xbox I do suggest you don't buy it.
                That makes sense. But to be honest the vast majority of people playing this on Xbox are just playing it through GamePass, which they‚Äôre already paying for. But I agree, I wouldn‚Äôt pay $30 for it if I didn‚Äôt already have access to it through some other means
        Look at 90% of the Paldea dex and tell me they aren't ai generated¬†
            how do they look ai generated tf?
                Gouging Fire looks like somebody told an ai to generate a Triceratops¬†
                    Gouging fire looks cool tho what?
                        Gouging Fire looks fucking horrible. Also glad to see ai art is ok as long as it's "cool" lol
                            It‚Äôs literally not ai dumbass
                                Neither is Palworld. Plus Pok√©mom has gotten in trouble a few times for using ai art in their games lol
            <10% look AI generated and it's a stretch.
                Well actually if you subscribe to Imagination Theory then all the Paradox mons were created by the AI professors ü§ì
    Pok√©mon-Ark is definitely peak. Couldn‚Äôt put it down yesterday and I definitely agree with some aspects but it definitely is truer to Ark than Pok√©mon.
Because it's sold 5 million copies in 3 days since releasing on gamepass.
Gameplay loop is really tight for an indie game
brother those are sheep, of all the examples you could've used you decide to use the one where the inspiration is a fucking sheepüíÄüíÄüíÄ
Honestly, a shame it came from a company with that sorta history. But for what it is, its one of the more entertaining pokemon ripoffs. 


And though its fucking sad as hell to state this as a pro. Atleast they arent falsely advertising footage from pokemon fan games to pass off their game as something better than it is like 90% of the ripoffs.
They can‚Äôt, the palworld devs have added just enough in the exact right areas to avoid copyright infringement. You can‚Äôt copyright an idea, mechanic, or artstyle, and palworld doesn‚Äôt use the name ‚ÄúPok√©mon‚Äù or the names or designs of any official Pok√©mon.

They‚Äôre basically going ‚Äúna-na, you can‚Äôt sue me!‚Äù
They wouldn‚Äôt win
And yet people are praising sooo
[deleted]
    The slavery is completely optional and illegal in-game. Just like the capturing of humans and the selling of their body parts (yes, you can do that).
        WHAT THE F?!!!!!!!!!1111!!!!
        >Just like the capturing of humans and selling of their body parts

Hold up. Wait a minute...
            I'm not joking.
        Now, you got my attention :D
        Hello??? Based department?
        freak you
Fucker went from Cinderace to Chlorogoal
It's not even similar
*Not* Lopunny
The gameplay loop isn't actually an issue. You can't copyright genres or gameplay. The Pal designs are what could lead to issues.
Amphoras's Palmon "coungerpart" isn't rveb close either tbh
Not gonna happen. There‚Äôs a chance it‚Äôll be attempted, but it won‚Äôt go anywhere

Microsoft wouldn‚Äôt have paid this developer to have the game on GamePass if they thought Nintendo had any legal rights to take this game down‚Ä¶
    >it won‚Äôt go anywhere

Tell that to the Nintendo Ninjas.


/j
Ampharos is goated. That thing is an abomination
    In my opinion ampharos is over rated would prefer it if it looked more like a sheep the pal world one Is a silly little guy
    Same. Too bad he isn't actually a Dragon. Gen 6 ruined me.
Yeah
Its pokemon with guns what more can someone want
    Oh definitely.

They just released a report saying that the sales and players have been so overwhelming they are having to do an emergency meeting with epic to try and save the servers ü§£
Why would they have to play this game to make AI voice clones? Why not just grab any recording of them playing any game? What a weird take
    Because they claim they own the rights to all footage of anyone playing their game so they can say they did it ethically
        Unless there‚Äôs a EULA that has to be agreed upon and ‚Äúsigned‚Äù before playing the game, that won‚Äôt hold up at all. If that‚Äôs the case, then more power to em. People don‚Äôt seem to care one way or another
> MILLION people *paid* $30 for

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

*Beep, boop, I'm a bot*
    Thank you bot
Lol you should try it. Its incredibly fun and addicting.
I know, I just don't care if a multibillion dollar company has their designs ripped off. I also think it's great that a large game is finally embracing AI.

Palworld does Pokemon better than Pokemon.
    I see your argument brought up a lot, and that's not the problem.

The problem isn't that they're stealing designs from a rich company, the problem is that the people who made the original designs were humans and artists with skill and passion. They put effort into this stuff for it to just be ripped away and Palworld claims it as their own.

Imagine you made your own Pokemon and then someone steals your drawing and says they made it. Doesn't seem very kind, does it?
        It's only unkind if you view it as unkind. Everyone seems to have this idea that taking something someone else made and using it yourself is somehow disrespectful, and I don't understand that at all. It doesn't harm the original creator in any way, especially if they were salaried. Meanwhile, the developers are able to put less time into making designs and more time into making the game since they're using designs that already exist.
            Excuse me, so stealing personal works and ideas is okay to you? Like if someone took an idea that you have, say it's theirs and sell it without you gaining anything?

And do you know that thing that is called plagiarism? You know, something that is illegall
                >without you gaining anything?

Game Freak employees have already been compensated for their ideas. They get paid a salary. They are losing nothing.
                    They are not getting paid by Palword's creators, and they used the original creator's creations
                        They get paid the same whether Game Freak licenses out the designs or not.

Also, if palworld didn't exist, they wouldn't be getting anything from it anyway. So, they still aren't losing anything they otherwise would've had.
                            They are not getting what they deserve. Pok√©mon used their designs, they paid for them. Palword should do the same

If not, I could write the exact same story as, let's say, Shadowhunters, changing only the names of the characters and creatures, and sell it for the same price. Plagiarism? What is that?
                                Maybe for the newer designs I'd agree with you, but a lot of older Pokemon designs are over 20 years old at this point. The original copyright law was 20 years, enough time to profit off of your idea before you need to come up with a new one. Then, Disney bribed Congress to extend copyright to ridiculous levels.

If it weren't for bribes, Gens 1, 2, and 3 would be public domain by now. Those designs are ethical to use.
        Has there been a single bit of proof anything was done with AI? I havent seen anything that actually proves its AI generated.
    I bet you also liked when that one company made Stan Lee NFTs.
Clutch your pearls harder. This is no different than if this company looked at the Pok√©dex to draw their own creatures from the likeness of already existing Pok√©mon. The only difference is it‚Äôs a faster process.

Popular media has always been copied with ‚Äúa new twist‚Äù for monetary gain. There are legitimate concerns when it comes to AI, but this isn‚Äôt one of them considering plagiarism will always be a problem wether or not AI exists
    If you legitimately don't see a difference between a person making derivative character designs and a computer mass producing them, then you don't know what art actually is, and your opinions are invalid.
        Sorry to break it to you, but I went to college for art. I have my bachelors degree in graphic design and an associate degree in fine art. My opinions are only invalid to you because you don‚Äôt like them
            If you're willing to throw all that away with the idea that what you make is conceivably no different than what a computer algorithm can spit out given enough attempts and enough stolen art fed into it, I don't even care. The idea that art doesn't have to be made by people is the most anti-art statement possible, and how dare you use your credentials as an artist to defend it. Scumbag.
                Yes how dare I, oh the agony! Call me whatever you want. You‚Äôre so mad that I didn‚Äôt immediately condemn AI that you‚Äôre not even paying attention to what I‚Äôm saying, and instead are putting words in my mouth and making up narratives for me that I didn‚Äôt even bring about.

I never once said that art made by real people can‚Äôt be or isn‚Äôt distinguishable from what AI creates. I said that if people want to plagiarize art for their own monetary gain, they will, regardless of the existence of AI.

I‚Äôll say it again, there are very important and potentially devastating dilemmas that could be a world wide issue in regard to AI and its advancements, but plagiarizing art isn‚Äôt one of them.
                    You're just lying now. I can still read what you said earlier, and you did, in fact, say that a human artist plagiarizing existing material to produce something is no different from an AI program doing it. One is derivative art, the other isn't art, and if you don't see the difference, I stand by my assessment of you as scum.

What you're doing right now, regardless of whether it's purposeful or not, is smuggling procedural generation into the definition of art. It isn't and never can be. That is what's important right now; the devaluing of art into a product being made on a factory line. So arguing as you did that it doesn't matter if a popular game like this used AI to make its art assets is, actually, much worse than if they'd just copied the designs.

So yes, you are still anti-art regardless of your credentials as an artist.
                        Derivative art is created by literally copying pre existing material and making it sightly different or new. AI is doing **THE EXACT SAME THING!** So yes, you‚Äôre right, I‚Äôm saying human plagiarism is the same as AI plagiarism.

And on that note, who are you to say derivative art can only be created by people? What gives you the authority to tell someone what is or isn‚Äôt art? Art is meant to be interpreted by everyone in whatever way they see it. Just because you don‚Äôt see it as art doesn‚Äôt mean you have the right to tell others it‚Äôs not art. If you despise AI for stealing other art pieces to create its own, then you should have as much hate for people that do the same and call it derivative art‚Ä¶
    People drawing creatures based on Pok√©mon usually aren‚Äôt making money from it like palworld is
        I edited my comment to better convey what I was trying to prove. Re read my last comment
    Yeah you get down voted but honestly who cares. Sure there are hollow ways to use AI to make non substantial games, but if the game is good who the fuck cares how they did it. Imaging having fun in a game and later you find out that they used ai to create it... Now what??
        The problem is not that they used the ai to create game mechanics. The problem comes when it is used to copy paste creatures from other games, it is basically plagiarism and it should not get any type of acknowledgement
        That's like saying who cares if the meal you bought was stolen and the restaurant you paid didn't actually cook it.
>But if the game is good who the fuck cares how they did it

Anyone with a brain and a heart cares. We care whether or not the things we enjoy were created fairly and ethically. I don't want to give money to a studio that stole the art and passion of other humans. I don't want to support people that steal art and claim it as their own.

Do you understand my point?
            Not really. The fact that it's stolen art, yeah that's understandable to criticize. The fact that it was AI generated.. not at all. And I was talking about AI, not copyright.
"Poke-like" isn't a thing you mean monster catching games, cuz pokemon sure as fuck didn't invent that genre not every monster catching game is a rip off
    It poke-like because its meant to be like rouge-like
        Again not a thing I've literally never heard that term before yesterday when you said it, if anything pokemon clone is more common of a term eveb if the term is just outright wrong in alot of cases like with digimon, and Dragon quest monsters being called rip-offs when they arent
Are you actually defending the cinderace one?

And the cobalion one?
I could see where you are coming from, except for Cinderace and Cobalion. Fake Cinderace has the same soccer bottoms effect, as well as the socks and the separating part. The hands also match up. Fake Cobalion has the same body shape and similar animal features as well as the same colouration (blue body, white tuft, brown-orange horn). The rest aren‚Äôt as bad for me, but still feel at least heavily influenced by Pokemon.
    Iq only agree with cobalion
Yeah, they probably copied it but they still are original
"Who cares if it breaks the law. I like this thing more than the one affected by it."
    You‚Äôre now twisting my words to a false narrative.
        Nope. I simply restated what you said to be more overt. Copyright violations are wrong regardless of how you feel about a company and its products. Ignoring the issue because you like the new product is weird.
            Quite frankly I have yet to try this game out but from what my colleagues say, it seems more promising than what TPC has provided in recent history. 

I still hold the Pok√©mon franchise to a special place in my heart but I can‚Äôt be pretending I still enjoy it, SV is proof of that, especially quality-wise.
                >it seems more promising than what TPC has provided in recent history. 

And that's fine. I agree honestly. However, I have no idea why they decided to walk a fine line with IPs considering how aggressive Nintendo and the Pokemon brand are about protecting their assets. It just unnecessarily puts a solid looking game at risk.
                    It would be quite interesting to see how this would fare, surely will have its pros and cons. Whatever happens, happens.
Maybe if you like survival games as a genre
    [removed]
        No not really, for two reasons:

1: Opinions cannot be objective 

2: They are different types of open world games. SV are story games, and PW is a survival game. They are completely different styles of games and comparing them is the same as comparing Ark and Pok√©mon.
        The open world is definitely more visually appealing, I just enjoyed what I was doing in SV more than Palworld. Want more depth to the monster battles themselves. Palworlds creature collecting depth is built into the automation of the survival game aspects.
i agree üíñ
Just so you know you're not alone in believing that, I agree.
Yeah but not all media is stolen and AI regenerated to avoid a lawsuit.

Well.. a lot is nowadays, but not all..
Better in what way? Palworld is a survival game at the end of the day, and if you don't really like survival games, it's not a great creature collector on top of that gameplay loop.
Most of us don't care which game is "better", we're angry that the Devs of palworld used AI generated Pokemon, and if you didn't know, the only way to make AI images is to steal from real artists and designs. So many of these 'pals' look like Pokemon/fakemon because the AI is just eating up the actual designs and spitting out this garbage.
(I don't want to seem rude) Palword is a survival game, Pok√©mon is an RPG with creature collection. They are completely different things...
And Totoro.
    What
Infinite fusion: xatoucannon
    That sounds like really anime move
    Tbh it would be more like xaannon/xannon or toucatu or toucatu if we were to go by normal infinite fusion naming standards but they could make a special exception to make it at least xacannon or smtn which sounds cool enough.
        You're right but i wish theyed do more like this where you can fully connect two names like lego and it just works spelling and phonetically.
            It's kinda hard to do that when you have hundreds of Pok√©mon tho i think something happened with mr mime cuz normally it'd be "mr M" plus something else but it's just mr so we can have mr pedo or mr ee/mr vee
            *they'd
Ain‚Äôt no way you said Xatu is bad
    Yes and I will die on this hill before I ever say he‚Äôs good
        I respect your will, but despise your opinion
            That‚Äôs fine
        You're just mad he's smarter and better looking than you
            No he just freaks me out
    Nah I dont think Xatu is bad, but I still think they improved it in pal world üòå /s
I will not stand for this xatu island (I do like the high dodo tho)
Xatu is perfect the way it is! I'll defend xatu to the moon and back

I swear we need to make using AI for video games and movies illegal or something..
    To be fair, there's no proof that it was used for this one. Just that the guy in charge really likes it and I'm not particularly willing to trust him.

Also, admittedly, there are some pretty unique designs here and there.
Definitely not terrible. I have seen some unique pals in the game but I do agree less ai could be used. Sure, ai for a design base but then a person should edit the design to make it less weird.
    Agreed
AI: How similar to pokemon do you want this game to be

CEO: Yes
Source?
    The CEO of the company said so on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/imZaytri/status/1748432267792547987) and detailed the process by which he did it.
        Those don't look like the creatures in the game, and as far as I'm aware, they can't be, because they said that all of the art was done by a single new hire. This tweet shows that the CEO decided to make a post about messing around with AI generated fakemon, but I highly doubt they would go so far as to put that into their game. Although it's entirely possible that they did, but right now it's just a theory.
            Unfortunately you're gonna get downvoted by all the losers who can't validate info.

Some people pointed out the CEO talked about possibilities with AI but literally nothing shows it was used in the game.

Like bro, people were ripping off designs DECADES before AI was a thing.

Also pretty sure even saw an interview or something around where the CEO talked about them expanding their studio by a good amount for Palworld and most was art team.

Like they ripped off Pokemon designs (though honestly like half of the ones OP put are stretches lmao) but you don't need AI to do that.

I'm not even into Palworld much. It plays like Ark which is a game I can never really get into.
            Well I don't think the CEO of the company that hire was working at lauding the power of AI gets that hire out of the woods just yet
The platupus
    The platypus was a popular Fakemon ‚Äústarter leak‚Äù before TemTem was made, so TemTem bought the rights from the artist for the platypus because it was popular.

That‚Äôs like, the one thing I knew about TemTem before it blew up after the SwSh controversy lol.
        Yeah, people thought it was the real-deal Pokemon starter since it was popular back in 2018. It's cool that someones work was put into a game.
    It looks ai af and yes i know it's from someone who made a pkmn "fanart"
        People thought it was an actual starter so I dont think its ai
        Well considering the Platypus was around years before Midjourney, Dall-E, Craiyon, etc., I doubt it
That's just an image of them showing off AI generated fakemon. Saying that the CEO admitted to using AI for that game is extremely misinformative, because he actually didn't say that at all, he said that it was all done by a single person. Granted, a single person who he also admitted "applied to hundreds of game dev studios and never got hired" which is extremely suspicious, but you can't just twist their words like that.
    The applying part isn‚Äôt that suspicious, game dev is a super competitive industry, especially if he‚Äôs just talking about a concept artist, rather than the modeler (I would be shocked if there wasn‚Äôt a modeling team of at least 3, modeling can‚Äôt be AI generated yet).

        I love spreading misinformation on the internet
        Thanks, that‚Äôs all I was asking. I hadn‚Äôt seen anything on it
I'm still not playing it because, 1. I don't trust the company from what I heard. 2. Just look at the monsters and tell me they aren't AI generated Pok√©mon.
    Don‚Äôt trust them to do or not do what?
        From what I've heard they abandoned the Xbox version of their last game and kept the PC version up to date. If you play Xbox I do suggest you don't buy it.
            That makes sense. But to be honest the vast majority of people playing this on Xbox are just playing it through GamePass, which they‚Äôre already paying for. But I agree, I wouldn‚Äôt pay $30 for it if I didn‚Äôt already have access to it through some other means
    Look at 90% of the Paldea dex and tell me they aren't ai generated¬†
        how do they look ai generated tf?
            Gouging Fire looks like somebody told an ai to generate a Triceratops¬†
                Gouging fire looks cool tho what?
                    Gouging Fire looks fucking horrible. Also glad to see ai art is ok as long as it's "cool" lol
                        It‚Äôs literally not ai dumbass
                            Neither is Palworld. Plus Pok√©mom has gotten in trouble a few times for using ai art in their games lol
        <10% look AI generated and it's a stretch.
            Well actually if you subscribe to Imagination Theory then all the Paradox mons were created by the AI professors ü§ì
Pok√©mon-Ark is definitely peak. Couldn‚Äôt put it down yesterday and I definitely agree with some aspects but it definitely is truer to Ark than Pok√©mon.
The slavery is completely optional and illegal in-game. Just like the capturing of humans and the selling of their body parts (yes, you can do that).
    WHAT THE F?!!!!!!!!!1111!!!!
    >Just like the capturing of humans and selling of their body parts

Hold up. Wait a minute...
        I'm not joking.

In my opinion ampharos is over rated would prefer it if it looked more like a sheep the pal world one Is a silly little guy
Same. Too bad he isn't actually a Dragon. Gen 6 ruined me.
Oh definitely.

They just released a report saying that the sales and players have been so overwhelming they are having to do an emergency meeting with epic to try and save the servers ü§£
Because they claim they own the rights to all footage of anyone playing their game so they can say they did it ethically
    Unless there‚Äôs a EULA that has to be agreed upon and ‚Äúsigned‚Äù before playing the game, that won‚Äôt hold up at all. If that‚Äôs the case, then more power to em. People don‚Äôt seem to care one way or another
Thank you bot
I see your argument brought up a lot, and that's not the problem.

The problem isn't that they're stealing designs from a rich company, the problem is that the people who made the original designs were humans and artists with skill and passion. They put effort into this stuff for it to just be ripped away and Palworld claims it as their own.

Imagine you made your own Pokemon and then someone steals your drawing and says they made it. Doesn't seem very kind, does it?
    It's only unkind if you view it as unkind. Everyone seems to have this idea that taking something someone else made and using it yourself is somehow disrespectful, and I don't understand that at all. It doesn't harm the original creator in any way, especially if they were salaried. Meanwhile, the developers are able to put less time into making designs and more time into making the game since they're using designs that already exist.
        Excuse me, so stealing personal works and ideas is okay to you? Like if someone took an idea that you have, say it's theirs and sell it without you gaining anything?

And do you know that thing that is called plagiarism? You know, something that is illegall
            >without you gaining anything?

Game Freak employees have already been compensated for their ideas. They get paid a salary. They are losing nothing.
                They are not getting paid by Palword's creators, and they used the original creator's creations
                    They get paid the same whether Game Freak licenses out the designs or not.

Also, if palworld didn't exist, they wouldn't be getting anything from it anyway. So, they still aren't losing anything they otherwise would've had.
                        They are not getting what they deserve. Pok√©mon used their designs, they paid for them. Palword should do the same

If not, I could write the exact same story as, let's say, Shadowhunters, changing only the names of the characters and creatures, and sell it for the same price. Plagiarism? What is that?
                            Maybe for the newer designs I'd agree with you, but a lot of older Pokemon designs are over 20 years old at this point. The original copyright law was 20 years, enough time to profit off of your idea before you need to come up with a new one. Then, Disney bribed Congress to extend copyright to ridiculous levels.

If it weren't for bribes, Gens 1, 2, and 3 would be public domain by now. Those designs are ethical to use.
    Has there been a single bit of proof anything was done with AI? I havent seen anything that actually proves its AI generated.
I bet you also liked when that one company made Stan Lee NFTs.
If you legitimately don't see a difference between a person making derivative character designs and a computer mass producing them, then you don't know what art actually is, and your opinions are invalid.
    Sorry to break it to you, but I went to college for art. I have my bachelors degree in graphic design and an associate degree in fine art. My opinions are only invalid to you because you don‚Äôt like them

[Here's](https://twitter.com/imZaytri/status/1748432267792547987) Pocketpair's CEO admitting to using gnerative AI in Palworld.
    I love spreading misinformation on the internet
    Thanks, that‚Äôs all I was asking. I hadn‚Äôt seen anything on it
Don‚Äôt trust them to do or not do what?
    From what I've heard they abandoned the Xbox version of their last game and kept the PC version up to date. If you play Xbox I do suggest you don't buy it.
        That makes sense. But to be honest the vast majority of people playing this on Xbox are just playing it through GamePass, which they‚Äôre already paying for. But I agree, I wouldn‚Äôt pay $30 for it if I didn‚Äôt already have access to it through some other means
Look at 90% of the Paldea dex and tell me they aren't ai generated¬†
    how do they look ai generated tf?
        Gouging Fire looks like somebody told an ai to generate a Triceratops¬†
            Gouging fire looks cool tho what?
                Gouging Fire looks fucking horrible. Also glad to see ai art is ok as long as it's "cool" lol
                    It‚Äôs literally not ai dumbass
                        Neither is Palworld. Plus Pok√©mom has gotten in trouble a few times for using ai art in their games lol
    <10% look AI generated and it's a stretch.
        Well actually if you subscribe to Imagination Theory then all the Paradox mons were created by the AI professors ü§ì
WHAT THE F?!!!!!!!!!1111!!!!
>Just like the capturing of humans and selling of their body parts

Hold up. Wait a minute...
    I'm not joking.
Now, you got my attention :D
Hello??? Based department?
freak you
Unless there‚Äôs a EULA that has to be agreed upon and ‚Äúsigned‚Äù before playing the game, that won‚Äôt hold up at all. If that‚Äôs the case, then more power to em. People don‚Äôt seem to care one way or another
It's only unkind if you view it as unkind. Everyone seems to have this idea that taking something someone else made and using it yourself is somehow disrespectful, and I don't understand that at all. It doesn't harm the original creator in any way, especially if they were salaried. Meanwhile, the developers are able to put less time into making designs and more time into making the game since they're using designs that already exist.
    Excuse me, so stealing personal works and ideas is okay to you? Like if someone took an idea that you have, say it's theirs and sell it without you gaining anything?

And do you know that thing that is called plagiarism? You know, something that is illegall
        >without you gaining anything?

Game Freak employees have already been compensated for their ideas. They get paid a salary. They are losing nothing.
            They are not getting paid by Palword's creators, and they used the original creator's creations
                They get paid the same whether Game Freak licenses out the designs or not.

Also, if palworld didn't exist, they wouldn't be getting anything from it anyway. So, they still aren't losing anything they otherwise would've had.
                    They are not getting what they deserve. Pok√©mon used their designs, they paid for them. Palword should do the same

If not, I could write the exact same story as, let's say, Shadowhunters, changing only the names of the characters and creatures, and sell it for the same price. Plagiarism? What is that?
                        Maybe for the newer designs I'd agree with you, but a lot of older Pokemon designs are over 20 years old at this point. The original copyright law was 20 years, enough time to profit off of your idea before you need to come up with a new one. Then, Disney bribed Congress to extend copyright to ridiculous levels.

If it weren't for bribes, Gens 1, 2, and 3 would be public domain by now. Those designs are ethical to use.
Has there been a single bit of proof anything was done with AI? I havent seen anything that actually proves its AI generated.
Sorry to break it to you, but I went to college for art. I have my bachelors degree in graphic design and an associate degree in fine art. My opinions are only invalid to you because you don‚Äôt like them
    If you're willing to throw all that away with the idea that what you make is conceivably no different than what a computer algorithm can spit out given enough attempts and enough stolen art fed into it, I don't even care. The idea that art doesn't have to be made by people is the most anti-art statement possible, and how dare you use your credentials as an artist to defend it. Scumbag.
        Yes how dare I, oh the agony! Call me whatever you want. You‚Äôre so mad that I didn‚Äôt immediately condemn AI that you‚Äôre not even paying attention to what I‚Äôm saying, and instead are putting words in my mouth and making up narratives for me that I didn‚Äôt even bring about.

I never once said that art made by real people can‚Äôt be or isn‚Äôt distinguishable from what AI creates. I said that if people want to plagiarize art for their own monetary gain, they will, regardless of the existence of AI.

I‚Äôll say it again, there are very important and potentially devastating dilemmas that could be a world wide issue in regard to AI and its advancements, but plagiarizing art isn‚Äôt one of them.
            You're just lying now. I can still read what you said earlier, and you did, in fact, say that a human artist plagiarizing existing material to produce something is no different from an AI program doing it. One is derivative art, the other isn't art, and if you don't see the difference, I stand by my assessment of you as scum.

What you're doing right now, regardless of whether it's purposeful or not, is smuggling procedural generation into the definition of art. It isn't and never can be. That is what's important right now; the devaluing of art into a product being made on a factory line. So arguing as you did that it doesn't matter if a popular game like this used AI to make its art assets is, actually, much worse than if they'd just copied the designs.

So yes, you are still anti-art regardless of your credentials as an artist.
                Derivative art is created by literally copying pre existing material and making it sightly different or new. AI is doing **THE EXACT SAME THING!** So yes, you‚Äôre right, I‚Äôm saying human plagiarism is the same as AI plagiarism.

And on that note, who are you to say derivative art can only be created by people? What gives you the authority to tell someone what is or isn‚Äôt art? Art is meant to be interpreted by everyone in whatever way they see it. Just because you don‚Äôt see it as art doesn‚Äôt mean you have the right to tell others it‚Äôs not art. If you despise AI for stealing other art pieces to create its own, then you should have as much hate for people that do the same and call it derivative art‚Ä¶
I edited my comment to better convey what I was trying to prove. Re read my last comment
The problem is not that they used the ai to create game mechanics. The problem comes when it is used to copy paste creatures from other games, it is basically plagiarism and it should not get any type of acknowledgement
That's like saying who cares if the meal you bought was stolen and the restaurant you paid didn't actually cook it.
>But if the game is good who the fuck cares how they did it

Anyone with a brain and a heart cares. We care whether or not the things we enjoy were created fairly and ethically. I don't want to give money to a studio that stole the art and passion of other humans. I don't want to support people that steal art and claim it as their own.

Do you understand my point?
    Not really. The fact that it's stolen art, yeah that's understandable to criticize. The fact that it was AI generated.. not at all. And I was talking about AI, not copyright.
Again not a thing I've literally never heard that term before yesterday when you said it, if anything pokemon clone is more common of a term eveb if the term is just outright wrong in alot of cases like with digimon, and Dragon quest monsters being called rip-offs when they arent
Nope. I simply restated what you said to be more overt. Copyright violations are wrong regardless of how you feel about a company and its products. Ignoring the issue because you like the new product is weird.
    Quite frankly I have yet to try this game out but from what my colleagues say, it seems more promising than what TPC has provided in recent history. 

I still hold the Pok√©mon franchise to a special place in my heart but I can‚Äôt be pretending I still enjoy it, SV is proof of that, especially quality-wise.
        >it seems more promising than what TPC has provided in recent history. 

And that's fine. I agree honestly. However, I have no idea why they decided to walk a fine line with IPs considering how aggressive Nintendo and the Pokemon brand are about protecting their assets. It just unnecessarily puts a solid looking game at risk.
            It would be quite interesting to see how this would fare, surely will have its pros and cons. Whatever happens, happens.
No not really, for two reasons:

1: Opinions cannot be objective 

2: They are different types of open world games. SV are story games, and PW is a survival game. They are completely different styles of games and comparing them is the same as comparing Ark and Pok√©mon.
The open world is definitely more visually appealing, I just enjoyed what I was doing in SV more than Palworld. Want more depth to the monster battles themselves. Palworlds creature collecting depth is built into the automation of the survival game aspects.
You're right but i wish theyed do more like this where you can fully connect two names like lego and it just works spelling and phonetically.
    It's kinda hard to do that when you have hundreds of Pok√©mon tho i think something happened with mr mime cuz normally it'd be "mr M" plus something else but it's just mr so we can have mr pedo or mr ee/mr vee
    *they'd
I respect your will, but despise your opinion
    That‚Äôs fine
You're just mad he's smarter and better looking than you
    No he just freaks me out
Those don't look like the creatures in the game, and as far as I'm aware, they can't be, because they said that all of the art was done by a single new hire. This tweet shows that the CEO decided to make a post about messing around with AI generated fakemon, but I highly doubt they would go so far as to put that into their game. Although it's entirely possible that they did, but right now it's just a theory.
    Unfortunately you're gonna get downvoted by all the losers who can't validate info.

Some people pointed out the CEO talked about possibilities with AI but literally nothing shows it was used in the game.

Like bro, people were ripping off designs DECADES before AI was a thing.

Also pretty sure even saw an interview or something around where the CEO talked about them expanding their studio by a good amount for Palworld and most was art team.

Like they ripped off Pokemon designs (though honestly like half of the ones OP put are stretches lmao) but you don't need AI to do that.

I'm not even into Palworld much. It plays like Ark which is a game I can never really get into.
    Well I don't think the CEO of the company that hire was working at lauding the power of AI gets that hire out of the woods just yet
Yeah, people thought it was the real-deal Pokemon starter since it was popular back in 2018. It's cool that someones work was put into a game.
People thought it was an actual starter so I dont think its ai
Well considering the Platypus was around years before Midjourney, Dall-E, Craiyon, etc., I doubt it

If it weren't for bribes, Gens 1, 2, and 3 would be public domain by now. Those designs are ethical to use.
