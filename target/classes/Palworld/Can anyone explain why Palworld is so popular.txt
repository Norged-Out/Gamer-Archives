[[Can anyone explain why Palworld is so popular]]


It's just a Ark Survival Evolved style of survival crafting game but with Monster Taming elements from what i see and it's an Early Access Title.Wouldnt people be skeptical of that instead of rushing to join in??


people have wanted a good open world pokemon game for years and years. So this dev gave it to them, pretty simple.
    not to mention a pokemon that people on non nintendo consoles can play, shits an untapped market until now
        Isn’t there a Pokémon cell phone game that’s hugely popular?
            It's a MOBA iirc, very different
            Pokemon Go is a poor substitute. The only meaningful interaction you can have with the pokemon you catch is a super over-simplified battle system
    [removed]
        Bruh people aren’t saying «I love Palworld because it is the same genre as pokemon» there are several pokemon games in different genres. «A pokemon game» does not mean «turn based battling» it just means «A game that has pokemon»
            I was never into Pokemon until they put guns, open world crafting, and survival elements into it

Except it isn't Pokemon so I guess I'm still not into Pokemon

I'm into Palworld
                You don’t understand it either apparently :) thats fine
                    First time I comment on Reddit. It's okay this was expected.
It takes a bunch of elements people enjoy from other games and blends them together fairly nicely. 

As an aside, I've never wondered why a game I don't like is popular. The answer is always "Because some people enjoy that type of game, just not me."
    From my experience, it seems like it’s a game for people who like the idea of Pokémon, but don’t like the games.

Kind of like how “Rogue One” and “Andor” was a film for people who like the idea of Star Wars, but not the actual films.

the turn-based gameplay of Pokemon can be ultra snoozefest to some people. However, the Pokemon themselves and the world they live in are super interesting.

I feel like that’s why palworld took off. Not because its  “*Pokémon, but with guns*” or its “*Survival game with pokemon*”. But because it’s “**Open World Pokémon game where we get to fight and explore the world together alongside my Pokémon**” A game many people have been asking gamefreak for decades.
        I personally like it because it has base building/crafting, a giant open world, and movement like BotW without the annoying convoluted story like BotW. 

Have never played a Pokemon game, watched a Pokemon show, or know anything about Pokemon other than that you throw the balls on SSB and the little furry thing shows up to fight. 

I'm sure there's plenty of people that like the game for the reason you've stated, but there's more going on with the game beyond "It's like Pokemon." It literally has a knockoff of Conan Exile's build menu, base raids like a lite easymode version of Rimworld and open world exploration and movement akin to the popular Zelda games. And guns. 

It takes a lot of elements people enjoy from other games, if it were just "it's like Pokemon", an old fuck like me that has no experience with or appreciation for Pokemon would not play it. But I have over a combined 8k hours put into Rimworld and Conan Exiles and this game scratches a similar itch, hopefully it's EA is as successful and meaningful as Rimworld's was and they do a better job of fixing bugs than Funcom ever has.

        > like I can just dump stuff in chests and when I am crafting it will use the stuff from the chests, that alone is worth 10 bucks.

Literally made me so angry when I realized it does this and Conan Exiles which has had updates for six years doesn't. Friggin' small indy game can, no excuse!

> rn you have 0 agency, you just run around and wait while your pokemon attacks on an interval

How far have you leveled? I had that same feeling until I got a +2 handgun blueprint and the bolt action rifle, now it feels like I outdamage all but my three Lucky's.
If only there were hundreds of videos, posts, articles, subsequent comments on the subject.
    Yeah,it sounds like a mechanically enticing premise, but here's the thing: We dont see Ark Survival Evolved being that popular. And we all know Early Access can be a scam sometimes, because of the whole work in progress thing.

It also doesnt have much of a story?
        ARK runs like shit on most people's hardware is a huge issue

ARK is also a bit too hardcore
        You're completely missing the point and just focusing on individual details and disregarding the package as a whole.

It's popular because it's incredibly fun, right now and it's current state It's fun as fuck.

I don't care that it's early access The game could never get an update again and I'd be happy with my money and its current state, if it gets future updates cool that's a nice bonus.

I don't care about pokémon or know anything about them, The combination of all the different game mechanics coming together, the complexity and detail and endless ability to upgrade and tweak your pals makes it incredibly engaging and gives you a wide variety of things to do.

Sometimes I just go out exploring looking for dungeons or new bosses or sometimes looking for new pals to catch, sometimes I spend hours just in the base doing breeding, farming, building upgrading.

The game is popular because it's incredibly fun and has a lot to offer, you can break down the details or focus on the shortcomings but you'll be missing the forest for the trees.
            Alright, you sort of sold me on the idea of buying it, but lets says compare it to Ark Survival Evolved....Some very specific questions,because that survival game turned me off with certain design decisions.

Right now, i need a new to go to game to last the month until Dragon's Dogma 2 , so i might as well give it a try,but.....

[1.How](http://1.how) is the grind in this game? Part of the reason i fell off Ark Survival Evolved was that it was just too grindy when i tried it.

[2.How](http://2.how) does the base building work, exactly? Ark Survival Evolved was really bad with people being able to destroy your base in multiplayer,making hours of work gone.

3.Does progress save across worlds? Sometimes i might want to go solo, or derp around in multiplayer.

I can ignore the lack of story and early access status, since it looks mechanically mostly sound and fun at foundational level, but survival games from what i have seen tend to make the experience unbearable in some aspects, which can be a turn off.
                Much less grind than ark. Building isn't super important - the goal of building is really to make things to help you "catch em all".

The game is less multiplayer focused than Ark IMO.
        It is the first time someone has made a decent rip-off if Pokemon. They added guns and you can capture people too. Combine that with some crafting, breeding and basic survival elements and you get a very popular game.
            > It is the first time someone has made a decent rip-off if Pokemon. 

This is a straight up lie.
                Oooo please elaborate. I'd love to know some more!
                    Not OP but the only game I can think of would be temtem which did "decent" then eventually turned to shit when the playerbase died out, but other then that idk what else they could be thinking of lol.
                        Siralim is also fairly adjacent, but the main and only real similarity is the collecting monsters part and it's a much more niche genre of game.
                well we would love to hear the truth, what are some good ripoffs?
                    Depends on your definition of ripoff but there are a couple of good pokemon like games

Coromon

Cassette Beasts

Monster Sanctuary
            Its not a rip off of pokemon. It takes elements from it. But not a rip off. That is like saying any other monster tamer games are rip offs.
        Ark has an insane cult following, it just doesn't really move out of it's bubble.

I was watching the xbox showcase in later summer, where ARK Survival: Ascended was rumored to be given a release date. The show was maybe 40 minutes, and ARK was the last entry. The entire time, on twitch, on youtube, the chat was permanently and exclusively ARK spam.
        Ark old, ark more expensive.  I really wish people were taught critical thinking these days.  Absolutely atrocious the dumb questions people can't answer after 30 seconds of thought.
        > It also doesnt have much of a story?

There are logbooks in random places in the game's world that can be discovered and read. They provide the lore of the game from that adventurer's perspective before whatever happened to them.

Take two of the biggest genres, creature collectors and survival games, with large demand and generally below average games combine them keep the best parts of both and do it generally better then the other titles in the respective genres.

Personally I was really skeptical since I heard about the game like 3 years ago, but youtubers got to drop footage of it early and I was sold. Its not the "best" game I've played recently but its certainly one of the most fun ones I've played recently and thats really all I could want from it.
Nintendo could’ve had so much potential with the Pokemon ip
    Yea I'm just imagining this game in the Pokemon universe with even the slightest story baked in.... Replace towers with Gyms. Have a couple of different towns. 

Had potential to be the biggest Pokemon game since Red/Blue (not counting GO).
It's silly, it's fun. Your friends are playing and it's only $30. Not terribly complicated I think.
It's like asking why people find Valorant fun, "it's just cartoon CS:GO" - well that is what some people enjoy. In this case, people like the look of Pokemon, with a game that utilizes them well, and has base building with light survival elements.
    Fr, people can't seem to comprehend others liking stuff they themselves don't.
        The OP was just asking for opinions, is it that offensive to you?
            And he got my opinion, is THAT offensive to you? lol
                Why would I be offended? I'm not the one telling others to shut up and not comment or make questions.
    Tbh i find myself saying this about alot of games these days
Has a lot of fun mechanics combined into a decent game.

Personally, I like the exploration mechanics, finding new pals is rewarding (experience and some are fun to play with) and the power growth curve is extremely well tuned.

Like it can be occassionally annoying to craft some items slowly, then you unlock an assembly line and better pals to help you and it feels rewarding.

If you liked ark, you will like it. If you liked valheim, you will probably like it. And if you liked either AND like pokemon, then it is basically in "Dream game" territory.

It's a solid 8-8.5/10 and with polish could easily be a 9-9.5.
    If this game gets a little more storyline in single player. Some mechanics/AI fixes.... Watch out...

I could see DLCs with other islands etc. 

It's just too dang fun.
It's multiplayer, open world Pokemon on PC and more fleshed out and complex than anything GameGreak has made in 10 years.

Pokemon is something many PC gamers grew up with. It makes a lot of sense that this would be popular.

Oh and it's a hell of a lot cheaper too.
Pokemon and guns make gamers something-something. GO CRAZY? DONT MIND IF I DO!
    You forgot the most important thing

IT'S ON STEAM
    Halloween episodes are my favourite thing about the simpsons lol
I can explain it as someone who grew up loving pokemon and really fell off over the years. In elementary school, pokemon felt like the first game that you could truly make your own. With so many different pokemon and move sets you could teach them, it felt like the first game you could truly be creative with, likely similar to what people thought about Minecraft, Fortnite, and other huge games that came later. You felt like you could express your creativity in the way you approached each fight in a way that simply wasnt possible in other games of its time.

Over the years, Gamefreak made extremely minor changes to the core of the game. Hell, the first truly 3D pokemon adventure wasnt even until 2013, and it was still mechanically identical to the games before it. Games evolved and became so much better, meanwhile pokemon just didnt. It was functionally the same game I played in my elementary school courtyard with my friends in 1996.

Now, a new game comes along and offers the first truly open world pokemon. Better yet, it gives em guns and says “Why the hell CANT you capture people?” And “what happens when you butcher a pokemon?” Literally all the questions that have been lingering unanswered by the main core series for 26 years. On top of that, it streamlines an ok core survival game and builds its pokemon mechanics within it.

For people who dont get or like this game, its completely understandable. It looks and feels like an crap asset flip with some generic pokemon sprinkled on top. But for us who have bern waiting years and years for the Pokemon Co to innovate, its the game my adolescent brain dreamed I was really playing over 26 years ago now finally fleshed out.
    Perfectly put! I’m in the same boat, and honestly I feel like Palworlds Pals are more true to original pokemon designs than newer pokemon are, too
    Same age range, same 1996 history, ...
You played this game, and pointed out that it looks and feels like a crap asset flip.

How is it really? What are the fun things for you in this game? The footage I've seen gives me cheap f2p vibes 

Thing seems like some sort of overnight success, haven't really heard about it until just now ...

EDIT: Just checked the other games of those guys. Holy shit they are almost criminal in their blatant copying, why do people support this ...
        Just like people who support other copycat games like League of Legends, Valorant, monster catching clones, Diablo clones, Soul-like games, Genshin Impact, etc etc....

Most people don't care as long as they are good games.
Nintendo's conservative way of handling their IPs left millions of people longing years for something like Palworld. That's really all there is to it.
It runs better than ark haha
    It's also alot less hardcore than ark is
        Yea Ark is the most hardcore grind. RUST is the most hardcore PVP.

This game is like Ark and Pokemon had a baby, but it's a lot nicer (easier) than either.... I'd say it's even easier than some of the early Pokemon games where you needed to do a really good job of mixing your lineup for boss fights.
        Yes, I don't have to grind nearly as hard in palworld to get somewhere. ARK is a major grind fest.
There's a large group of people that like pokemon and want more games like pokemon.

There's a large group of people that like pokemon, but don't play on conoles anymore.

There's a large group of people that liked pokemon, but don't vibe with the direction nintendo has taken the series.

There's a large group of people that like ark survival and want more games like that.

There's a large group of people that think pokemon shooting guns is funny and want to play a game like that.

There's a large group of people that have friends who fall into one or more of the groups mentioned above. Because the game has coop, they will join their friends in playing palworld.

There's a small group of people that saw the big pink lizard lady and bought the game to make a giant breeding farm for sex-hungry salamander girls.

The game has appeal for a large variety of different players.

Also unlike most early access, open world, crafty survival games- palworld isn't a total piece of shit. Not fantastic 10/10 goty, but good enough that most people can overlook the flaws.
I wish more games were a success like this.  We need more smash hit content.
I played it and thought it was a good “pokemon” game so if your into pokemon then yeah you will really enjoy it , other than that , the first things you will notice is how its stripped the fortnite swinging animation , elden ring like tree in the distance , zelda and fortnite gliding animations and all the pokemon characters then spliced it all into one. I personally find it abit disrespectful but the game market be like that so it doesnt affect whether its a good game or not.
    "Elden Ring like tree in the distance" is a very interesting phrase when the idea of Yggdrasil has been around for a LOOOOOONG time.
        Dont bark up the wrong tree buddie
Go read one of the 100+ other posts that are exactly like this.

It’s fun because people like it. If you don’t like it, chalk it up to preference. 

I’m sure there’s uncountable things that you don’t like, but other people do

Why? Maybe you have bad taste 🤷🏻‍♂️
It opens up the Pokemon universe in a fun and engaging way, that the core universe has failed to expand on in the 20 years it's been around.

People love Pokemon and that IP will always sell, but people want to do more in a Pokemon universe *too* beyond just fighting other pokemon trainers.

It scratches that "but just a little bit more, pretty please?" Itch.

And that it runs better than every Pokemon game released in the last 5 years, is just icing on the cake.
It's the first good Pokemon game in over a decade...
    Not even really a Pokémon game tbh.

Don't know why the downvotes, it's literally a different genre of game. Pokémon is a turn based rpg, not an open world survival game. Sure the monsters are basically Pokémon but it's an entirely different genre.
        Yah IDK why people are saying it's gonna crush Pokemon even though it's not even in the same genre.

It competes with ARK which is kind of a shit show tbh
        It’s not the game mechanics people care about, it’s literally just capturing pokemon. I hate turn based battling anyway, a lot of fans do, but we grew up on pokemon. Meanwhile gamefreak havent done shit to evolve the game franchise. Palworld is more in line of what we want out of Pokemon games. Comparing palworld to pokemon is not saying palworld has turn based battles. It’s stupid to focus on stuff thats not similar, when the whole point of comparing it is seeing the things that ARE similar.
        >Not even really a Pokémon game tbh. 

Guess Pokemon Snap isn't a pokemon game either, huh. People do not play Pokemon for exciting turn-based jrpg gameplay. Haven't for many years now. Turn-based Pokemon gameplay is about as stale as it gets. They play it because they like the monsters and world. Palworld took the good parts of Pokemon and shaved off the rotten bits.
            > People do not play Pokemon for exciting turn-based jrpg gameplay.

This is exactly why I play Pokemon and the main reason why I’ve been unhappy with the recent games because they refuse to add any sort of challenge or thought required and keep it being completely brain dead easy, even as an optional difficulty mode. Also that they’ve removed all exploration, Sword and Shield was exclusively hallways with a few dead end side paths and Scarlet and Violet are the most empty open world I’ve ever played in. 
                What kind of challenge do you foresee as being possible within the turn-based elemental strengths and weaknesses paradigm? Because I think it's a total dead end. Nothing interesting or new can be done with it, and they don't *want* to do anything interesting with it, because it's a game for children and the concept of water beats fire and fire beats grass is easy for children to master.
                    Just look at any of the many difficulty romhacks out there. Pokémon has so many moves, abilities, and mons for there to be an absolutely huge amount of room for potential depth. But they refuse to give trainers any real strategy or decent teams. There are constantly bosses that have 2, 3, or 4 Pokémon compared to the player’s 6 and there are only a handful of battles that can’t be beaten just by clicking your starter’s best move repeatedly.  And it doesn’t matter that it’s primarily for kids. Kids are not stupid, give them a problem and they’ll solve it. As long as the game has a proper difficulty  to teach them the game mechanics they will learn and improve and develop better problem solving skills as the game progresses. It doesn’t have to be Kaizo difficulty and it doesn’t even need to be forced, it can be optional to be engaging to older fans. The complexity is there, they just refuse to utilize it. Thats why I’ve been unhappy with GameFreak. Palworld is fun, but it’s not a Pokemon game and not what I want out of a Pokemon game. 
Its actually pretty mid.

The battles are boring, the AI is abyssmal, the world is empty, the story is dumb...but its still better than recent Pokemon games.
    Honestly the worst part about it for me is the user interface. Can’t rebind certain keys, and while it might maybe be logical for a controller perhaps, the keyboard and mouse experience is awful.
        they just patched it today and added missing keybindings I think. The patch notes said so.
            That might actually make it playable! I think I'll wait a bit still though. In general the user interface felt a bit rough. Navigating them was awkward and some things that should be automatic weren't.

I'll probably dip in one day, but after trying Enshrouded and Palworld, I think I'll explore Enshrouded first and maybe try Palworld in a few months to a year's time.
is all the things you wish do in pokemon but can't
Pokemon and a decent game. I don't want to play a Pokemon game, so it's not for me. Pokemon is widely popular though. People claiming it isn't pokemon are fucking stupid - it is.
    [Pokemon.](https://youtu.be/J_GvNw93eJ4)
People dont want new things they want the same stuff reskinned. Also they probably dont have anything else to play.

You can only play ark for so long before you get bored.
How would it not be popular? It’s an acceptable game, but the sticker is the preexisting fanbase of guns and Pokémon. Not to mention the controversy it generates by potentially using Nintendo’s IP and the whole AI art shit. Perfect storm for people to endlessly talk about it. Then you factor in the streamers getting involved. Then the YouTubers. It’s a self fulfilling prophecy.
    Because it's Early Access, which has been known to be a label for scummy work in progress practices in the industry? How are people not turned off by that?
        You’ll have to ask god about that one. People see early access and they gotta have it. No matter how many times they’ve been burned.
        Because the game is fun as fuck in it's current state, runs great, and has had relatively minor bugs.

It's in better shape now than many games on their official release.

If it never got another update I would be perfectly content with the money I've spent and the game and its current state.

It's not the promise of some future great product, it's a great product right now, well worth the money.
"hey guys i dont like a popular game and i want to be sure that you all know that i dont like it"

move on dude, no one cares. People like it, thus it's popular.
Others says Pokémon but that isn't just it. If you really examine at least 20+ gameplay videos like I did on YouTube, you'll find that PW is a COPYCAT game from LOTS of games they they "take" whatever they fancied from other games to glue them altogether into 1 game called PW = Pokémon with Guns.

So nothing in PW is "Original" by itself but the concept of "Borrowing" favorite elements + mechanisms + interactions to put all into 1 game is itself is original because it's most prone to Plagiarism accusations (not only because of Pokémon) and PW so far successfully dodged them but I wonder what will happen WHEN other developers to realize when their Animations, Models, Sounds, Mechanisms are "Ripped" from their game to end up in PW (again not only Nintendo, on the top of the list, Fortnite and others are ripped too).

Sadly skeptical customers like you and me are RARE but most players are currently under https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lemming.asp Effect to JUMP into PW to see "Dude, What the Fuss is Bout?" kind of mindset instead of doing their research properly to compare it overall against other games, especially the ones it's been accused against.

Also Developer of the game was clever enough NOT to use Denuvo or any other Protection on the game that PW was PIRATED the moment it got released so it's fame also spreads via Piracy Network either to turn some (of course not much) of the previous Pirates into Customers who like the game despite the controversy. This is one of those case that Piracy "Helped" the game to be more acknowledged.
    >Sadly skeptical customers like you and me are RARE but most players are currently under

I mean, originality was the last thing people expected when we saw 'Palworld' pop up in our Youtube reccomendations three years ago lmao.
It ripped off Pokemon.
You don't need to enjoy the same thing as the mainstream
Because it’s fun and it’s pokemon with guns
Pokemon
Is this not a mega thread yet? 💀
It's a lot of fun. Not my kind, but so far I see people having a good time with it.
Most of my friend are really having a blast despite that game being an unfinished (somewhat) basic game.

The crazy idea of a video game being fun and good  is that all people want.
For me because its ARK Evolved style crafting game with monster taming elements.
I would say: Cute creatures, simple interface and mechanisms  + a forgiving environment.
its not even free!
Plain and simple :

It‘s fun
It's better pokemon
Pokemon with guns on Steam. Nuff said.
having pets do a lot of cultivation work definitely has a huge help in that plus it’s an open world pokemon game a lot of people have wanted
Doom is just a walking simulator with guns, why do people like it?

Turns out a survival + monster hunting is something lots of people wanted and enjoy.
No
open world survival crafting early access = top of steam charts, just the way it is
I personally think it's silly, and I'm not into silly games. Then again, I felt the same about Fortnite, so what do I know?
Same reason beanie babies were popular lol
PixelMon, Ark, BotW, Early Access multiplayer survival game. People like the amalgam of other people’s ideas presented in it.
"Pokemon" + Survival... If it wasn't for the cuteness & pokemon part, i would play it too... But i can't stand it.
I always skip the animal parts in games and I’m terrible at builders. I’m not sure if I would enjoy this one.

Unless there’s cats to pet, of course.
not sure, bored af, refunded, no adrenaline, too easy
Its popular because people think its keeping them safe from pvp… for now
The people are Kraving for Kraven. Palworld allows people to become hunters like Kraven.
People want pokemon on PC. Nintendo are idiots. It's simple. 
It's a cool, funny and silly game lol
not to mention a pokemon that people on non nintendo consoles can play, shits an untapped market until now
    Isn’t there a Pokémon cell phone game that’s hugely popular?
        It's a MOBA iirc, very different
        Pokemon Go is a poor substitute. The only meaningful interaction you can have with the pokemon you catch is a super over-simplified battle system

The game is popular because it's incredibly fun and has a lot to offer, you can break down the details or focus on the shortcomings but you'll be missing the forest for the trees.
        Alright, you sort of sold me on the idea of buying it, but lets says compare it to Ark Survival Evolved....Some very specific questions,because that survival game turned me off with certain design decisions.

Right now, i need a new to go to game to last the month until Dragon's Dogma 2 , so i might as well give it a try,but.....

[1.How](http://1.how) is the grind in this game? Part of the reason i fell off Ark Survival Evolved was that it was just too grindy when i tried it.

[2.How](http://2.how) does the base building work, exactly? Ark Survival Evolved was really bad with people being able to destroy your base in multiplayer,making hours of work gone.

3.Does progress save across worlds? Sometimes i might want to go solo, or derp around in multiplayer.

I can ignore the lack of story and early access status, since it looks mechanically mostly sound and fun at foundational level, but survival games from what i have seen tend to make the experience unbearable in some aspects, which can be a turn off.
            Much less grind than ark. Building isn't super important - the goal of building is really to make things to help you "catch em all".

The game is less multiplayer focused than Ark IMO.
    It is the first time someone has made a decent rip-off if Pokemon. They added guns and you can capture people too. Combine that with some crafting, breeding and basic survival elements and you get a very popular game.
        > It is the first time someone has made a decent rip-off if Pokemon. 

This is a straight up lie.
            Oooo please elaborate. I'd love to know some more!
                Not OP but the only game I can think of would be temtem which did "decent" then eventually turned to shit when the playerbase died out, but other then that idk what else they could be thinking of lol.
                    Siralim is also fairly adjacent, but the main and only real similarity is the collecting monsters part and it's a much more niche genre of game.
            well we would love to hear the truth, what are some good ripoffs?
                Depends on your definition of ripoff but there are a couple of good pokemon like games

Coromon

Cassette Beasts

Monster Sanctuary
        Its not a rip off of pokemon. It takes elements from it. But not a rip off. That is like saying any other monster tamer games are rip offs.
    Ark has an insane cult following, it just doesn't really move out of it's bubble.

I was watching the xbox showcase in later summer, where ARK Survival: Ascended was rumored to be given a release date. The show was maybe 40 minutes, and ARK was the last entry. The entire time, on twitch, on youtube, the chat was permanently and exclusively ARK spam.
    Ark old, ark more expensive.  I really wish people were taught critical thinking these days.  Absolutely atrocious the dumb questions people can't answer after 30 seconds of thought.
    > It also doesnt have much of a story?

There are logbooks in random places in the game's world that can be discovered and read. They provide the lore of the game from that adventurer's perspective before whatever happened to them.

Yea I'm just imagining this game in the Pokemon universe with even the slightest story baked in.... Replace towers with Gyms. Have a couple of different towns. 

Had potential to be the biggest Pokemon game since Red/Blue (not counting GO).
Fr, people can't seem to comprehend others liking stuff they themselves don't.
    The OP was just asking for opinions, is it that offensive to you?
        And he got my opinion, is THAT offensive to you? lol
            Why would I be offended? I'm not the one telling others to shut up and not comment or make questions.
Tbh i find myself saying this about alot of games these days
If this game gets a little more storyline in single player. Some mechanics/AI fixes.... Watch out...

I could see DLCs with other islands etc. 

It's just too dang fun.
You forgot the most important thing

IT'S ON STEAM
Halloween episodes are my favourite thing about the simpsons lol
Perfectly put! I’m in the same boat, and honestly I feel like Palworlds Pals are more true to original pokemon designs than newer pokemon are, too
Same age range, same 1996 history, ...
You played this game, and pointed out that it looks and feels like a crap asset flip.

How is it really? What are the fun things for you in this game? The footage I've seen gives me cheap f2p vibes 

Thing seems like some sort of overnight success, haven't really heard about it until just now ...

EDIT: Just checked the other games of those guys. Holy shit they are almost criminal in their blatant copying, why do people support this ...
    Just like people who support other copycat games like League of Legends, Valorant, monster catching clones, Diablo clones, Soul-like games, Genshin Impact, etc etc....

Most people don't care as long as they are good games.
It's also alot less hardcore than ark is
    Yea Ark is the most hardcore grind. RUST is the most hardcore PVP.

This game is like Ark and Pokemon had a baby, but it's a lot nicer (easier) than either.... I'd say it's even easier than some of the early Pokemon games where you needed to do a really good job of mixing your lineup for boss fights.
    Yes, I don't have to grind nearly as hard in palworld to get somewhere. ARK is a major grind fest.
"Elden Ring like tree in the distance" is a very interesting phrase when the idea of Yggdrasil has been around for a LOOOOOONG time.
    Dont bark up the wrong tree buddie
Not even really a Pokémon game tbh.

Don't know why the downvotes, it's literally a different genre of game. Pokémon is a turn based rpg, not an open world survival game. Sure the monsters are basically Pokémon but it's an entirely different genre.
    Yah IDK why people are saying it's gonna crush Pokemon even though it's not even in the same genre.

It competes with ARK which is kind of a shit show tbh
    It’s not the game mechanics people care about, it’s literally just capturing pokemon. I hate turn based battling anyway, a lot of fans do, but we grew up on pokemon. Meanwhile gamefreak havent done shit to evolve the game franchise. Palworld is more in line of what we want out of Pokemon games. Comparing palworld to pokemon is not saying palworld has turn based battles. It’s stupid to focus on stuff thats not similar, when the whole point of comparing it is seeing the things that ARE similar.
    >Not even really a Pokémon game tbh. 

Guess Pokemon Snap isn't a pokemon game either, huh. People do not play Pokemon for exciting turn-based jrpg gameplay. Haven't for many years now. Turn-based Pokemon gameplay is about as stale as it gets. They play it because they like the monsters and world. Palworld took the good parts of Pokemon and shaved off the rotten bits.
        > People do not play Pokemon for exciting turn-based jrpg gameplay.

This is exactly why I play Pokemon and the main reason why I’ve been unhappy with the recent games because they refuse to add any sort of challenge or thought required and keep it being completely brain dead easy, even as an optional difficulty mode. Also that they’ve removed all exploration, Sword and Shield was exclusively hallways with a few dead end side paths and Scarlet and Violet are the most empty open world I’ve ever played in. 
            What kind of challenge do you foresee as being possible within the turn-based elemental strengths and weaknesses paradigm? Because I think it's a total dead end. Nothing interesting or new can be done with it, and they don't *want* to do anything interesting with it, because it's a game for children and the concept of water beats fire and fire beats grass is easy for children to master.
                Just look at any of the many difficulty romhacks out there. Pokémon has so many moves, abilities, and mons for there to be an absolutely huge amount of room for potential depth. But they refuse to give trainers any real strategy or decent teams. There are constantly bosses that have 2, 3, or 4 Pokémon compared to the player’s 6 and there are only a handful of battles that can’t be beaten just by clicking your starter’s best move repeatedly.  And it doesn’t matter that it’s primarily for kids. Kids are not stupid, give them a problem and they’ll solve it. As long as the game has a proper difficulty  to teach them the game mechanics they will learn and improve and develop better problem solving skills as the game progresses. It doesn’t have to be Kaizo difficulty and it doesn’t even need to be forced, it can be optional to be engaging to older fans. The complexity is there, they just refuse to utilize it. Thats why I’ve been unhappy with GameFreak. Palworld is fun, but it’s not a Pokemon game and not what I want out of a Pokemon game. 
Honestly the worst part about it for me is the user interface. Can’t rebind certain keys, and while it might maybe be logical for a controller perhaps, the keyboard and mouse experience is awful.
    they just patched it today and added missing keybindings I think. The patch notes said so.
        That might actually make it playable! I think I'll wait a bit still though. In general the user interface felt a bit rough. Navigating them was awkward and some things that should be automatic weren't.

I'll probably dip in one day, but after trying Enshrouded and Palworld, I think I'll explore Enshrouded first and maybe try Palworld in a few months to a year's time.
[Pokemon.](https://youtu.be/J_GvNw93eJ4)
Because it's Early Access, which has been known to be a label for scummy work in progress practices in the industry? How are people not turned off by that?
    You’ll have to ask god about that one. People see early access and they gotta have it. No matter how many times they’ve been burned.
    Because the game is fun as fuck in it's current state, runs great, and has had relatively minor bugs.

It's in better shape now than many games on their official release.

If it never got another update I would be perfectly content with the money I've spent and the game and its current state.

It's not the promise of some future great product, it's a great product right now, well worth the money.
>Sadly skeptical customers like you and me are RARE but most players are currently under

I mean, originality was the last thing people expected when we saw 'Palworld' pop up in our Youtube reccomendations three years ago lmao.
Isn’t there a Pokémon cell phone game that’s hugely popular?
    It's a MOBA iirc, very different
    Pokemon Go is a poor substitute. The only meaningful interaction you can have with the pokemon you catch is a super over-simplified battle system
Bruh people aren’t saying «I love Palworld because it is the same genre as pokemon» there are several pokemon games in different genres. «A pokemon game» does not mean «turn based battling» it just means «A game that has pokemon»
    I was never into Pokemon until they put guns, open world crafting, and survival elements into it

Except it isn't Pokemon so I guess I'm still not into Pokemon

I'm into Palworld
        You don’t understand it either apparently :) thats fine
            First time I comment on Reddit. It's okay this was expected.
I personally like it because it has base building/crafting, a giant open world, and movement like BotW without the annoying convoluted story like BotW. 

Have never played a Pokemon game, watched a Pokemon show, or know anything about Pokemon other than that you throw the balls on SSB and the little furry thing shows up to fight. 

I'm sure there's plenty of people that like the game for the reason you've stated, but there's more going on with the game beyond "It's like Pokemon." It literally has a knockoff of Conan Exile's build menu, base raids like a lite easymode version of Rimworld and open world exploration and movement akin to the popular Zelda games. And guns. 

It takes a lot of elements people enjoy from other games, if it were just "it's like Pokemon", an old fuck like me that has no experience with or appreciation for Pokemon would not play it. But I have over a combined 8k hours put into Rimworld and Conan Exiles and this game scratches a similar itch, hopefully it's EA is as successful and meaningful as Rimworld's was and they do a better job of fixing bugs than Funcom ever has.
> like I can just dump stuff in chests and when I am crafting it will use the stuff from the chests, that alone is worth 10 bucks.

Literally made me so angry when I realized it does this and Conan Exiles which has had updates for six years doesn't. Friggin' small indy game can, no excuse!

> rn you have 0 agency, you just run around and wait while your pokemon attacks on an interval

How far have you leveled? I had that same feeling until I got a +2 handgun blueprint and the bolt action rifle, now it feels like I outdamage all but my three Lucky's.
ARK runs like shit on most people's hardware is a huge issue

ARK is also a bit too hardcore
You're completely missing the point and just focusing on individual details and disregarding the package as a whole.

It's popular because it's incredibly fun, right now and it's current state It's fun as fuck.

I don't care that it's early access The game could never get an update again and I'd be happy with my money and its current state, if it gets future updates cool that's a nice bonus.

I don't care about pokémon or know anything about them, The combination of all the different game mechanics coming together, the complexity and detail and endless ability to upgrade and tweak your pals makes it incredibly engaging and gives you a wide variety of things to do.

Sometimes I just go out exploring looking for dungeons or new bosses or sometimes looking for new pals to catch, sometimes I spend hours just in the base doing breeding, farming, building upgrading.

The game is popular because it's incredibly fun and has a lot to offer, you can break down the details or focus on the shortcomings but you'll be missing the forest for the trees.
