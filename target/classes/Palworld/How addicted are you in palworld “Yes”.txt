[[How addicted are you in palworld “Yes”]]


Will continue next week probably


Titans in those walls.
    I imagine there's a creative mode setting? I suppose if you have a farm making walls isn't too bad unless cement was also needed
        Nah those walls are just 3 stone a piece. A farm or two running 24/7 would get you enough stone in like a day, maybe two or three idk I didn't count, if you design it well and your pals don't path themselves to an early grave. I left mine running overnight and came back ~14 hours later to 9999 stone.
            ~~3~~ 10 stone + 1 cement.



That's a lot of bones. 👀
                How else do you build the empire?
                Stone walls are just 3 stone no cement tho. 

Are we talking defensive stone walls? I thought we were talking about the walls and foundations to make all the buildings if not my bad. 
                    Oops, my bad, I thought we were talking about defensive walls (which are 10 stone + 1 cement.) 
^Corrected ^my ^original ^comment.



You are correct, those are only 3 stone. Which, there's A LOT here! 


This build really *rocks*... I'll see myself out...
                        To be fair to you though there still are a TON of defensive walls in that bitch!
                        You should be stoned for that one
                Easier to just buy bones from the merchant NPC.

    Tatakae…Tatakae
    Oh my god! Its the lucky titan! Ruuuuun
    First thought after they flew up too lol.
    OP better watch out for the rumbling
    With future mods having an absolutely enormous relaxasaurus lux raiding the base would be hilarious....

Attack from titan?

Make your own enormous pals? Evangelion?
At first, I was impressed.

And then...I was horrified.
    You summed it up pretty well I must say
        I love this game but my god there are such better games for building. Building in this game feels really unfinished. I can't imagine spending this much time wrestling with the build system.
            It's been out for a month on early access. Ark was janky too. Just give it time. Building is easy when you know how the broken system works lol
                “That slanted wall doesn’t fit here. Maybe if I remove this wall and these stairs…. Oh, Oops. I guess we’re living in a bungalow now.”
                    I had problems with slanted roofs, but if you put a piece down like making a ramp up to the where you need it, it clicks in. Then just delete what you don't want
                        I think the slanted roofs are intended to be placed on top of the flat roof. It's the only way the snap point makes sense to me.
                            As someone who builds roofs. Yes, the slanted pieces go on top of the flat part.
                                As someone who roofs, the flat part that the slanted part goes on is in fact— also slanted.
                                    That’s just semantics. Everything is slanted in one way of another.
                                    As someone who roofies, a slan...where are you guys going?
                            For an early access with the potential of tons of expansion, and patches - it’s pretty damn good.  It’s an amazing foundation that could have a ton of possibilities.
                    Multi-level stairs have been my major building annoyance. It seems like they just don't want to snap to the roof unless I'm standing at just the right angle
                Hasn’t it only been 2 weeks?
                    Yes
                Honestly, Ark is jankier than this even after years. Still love it, though.
                I mean building in ark is still ass also.
                    It is, but it got better. Hopefully this one improves
                        Agreed it DID improve.
I’m hoping for more of a Conan level glow up on the building to be honest.

I understand that this is basically ARK were your dinosaurs can work.
But that’s kind of my issue right now.
They should be shooting for Conan with animals…. And less boobs.
                            Eh I think the gameplay to boob ratio is fine tbh
                    Ascended really fixed up the building. I enjoy it a lot more now.
                I've been playing ark since the Xbox early access, the early early stages were so fucked sometimes. Couldn't place foundation because of terrain but it's on a flat surface.

Dinos wandering off never to return.

Accidentally using the wrong whistle and now all your dinos are a mile away.

Atleast pals stay in the base lol
                    My biggest wish, is flying pals to land. I really wanna see my birbs hop around.
                Ark was janky until a mod came out that did it better then they just added it to the base game.
                Omg it was made by the guys who made ARK!?!? No wonder I had this familiar but unsettling feeling.
            It’s almost like it’s an early access game lmfao
            Give it some time, it barely hatched.
            It’s almost like this game has only been out a few weeks on early access
    Kept thinking how I could never live without palworld by my side~
        But then I spent so many nights, thinking how it did me wrong...
            And I grew my pals strong and learned how to ride along..
                Now I'm back, from an hour's sleep;

Just spawned in to find my Pals are all sick and weak;
                    I should have never logged out 


I should have never went to sleep
                        If I had know for just one second how long that it would take..  
to make those meds! those fucking meds!.
                            Don't lay around town, I just built you 15 beds!
                                and I got all these spheres to give and built a farm to raise your kids
                                    I think I have the strongest foxparks, but then I meet Mammorest and he only barks
                                Go on now, go! Walk through the floor!

Just stand around now. 'Cause you're not working anymore.

                Your goal was to abuse an exploit that isn't going to be there on the full release? Weird flex but okay.
    At first I was horrified, and then I was like "maybe they're playing the wrong game lmao"
    My literal thoughts. Went from jaw dropped to concerned eyebrows within seconds.
    Is it worth getting? I’m on a tight budget and I’ve been wanting to buy it but I’m afraid I won’t like it and people are just on the hype train cause Pokémon
        It incorporates a lot of different game elements that are not just Pokemon. As far as new games go it is an incredible value at $30.
            well, it's not really new either.  it's ark+ pokemon mainly, with a few elements from breath of the wild.  i dont think they're doing anything new other than combining already understood concepts.

that being said, it's definitely fun.  however if you've already extensively played ark then there you'll find much of the game to be almost the same.  i haven't so it seems fresher than it is to me.

agree it's pretty good value for $30 but you do end up having to work around many of the faults in the game too.  if this were a triple a studio it would be viewed much differently.
                If it were a AAA studio it'd be worse and there wouldn't have been any patches to address issues for three months, and they'd be selling us pals with good passives via microtransaction... or just have us random draw them.
                    eh, this is definitely far buggier than my expectations and is riddled with obvious issues, such as a pretty stale gameplay loop and copy paste elements from other games.  this game can easily be monetized more so maybe that's the main difference you're seeing.

im only talking to talk.  it's the right use of the early access tag and the devs seem to be reasonable people atm.  everyone likes to support what they see as a good thing but let's be honest, gamers make bad decisions with their money and this can easily become another in a long line of games that did the exact same thing.
                Okay. But it is still a new game. Incorporating other games’ concepts doesn’t make it not a new game lol.
                    As a percentage, how much of the game would you say is new?  And what are those new concepts?
                        It’s arguing a moot point. Who cares. It is a new game that incorporates pieces of other games into it to create something fun. There’s no point arguing semantics of newness. It is a new game for $30 with known concepts.
                            this is a discussion.  but if you aren't able to answer the question then we do not have to continue
        It's worth every penny imo. I'm a big fan of Minecraft, Pokemon, and a myriad of RPGs and this scratches all those sweet spots. Obviously it's buggy since it's still pre-release, but tbh I've seen "finished" games with more bugs. The headaches don't come anywhere near superseding the experience overall. I wasn't even planning on touching this game because same with money issues but I saw ibxtoycat trying it out and it just seemed so much more engaging and rich than I would've ever expected.

Edit: I have it on PC, from what I see console could have different issues for you to overcome so I can't speak to that experience. Just to be clear.
            Let’s be clear, about 30 hours into my world or so my entire save just disappeared gone bye bye. I’d still say this is the best 30$$ I’ve ever spent. (Hours down the rabbit hole lead to finding a way to get your save back.)
            > but tbh I've seen "finished" games with more bugs

Cyberpunk 2077 comes to mind for me. But CD Projekt Red did the right thing and fixed the myriad of issues. It's a great game now. Well, It was great at launch too if you just looked past the glitchyness.
        If your budget is tight, it might be worth waiting a bit until you feel better about buying it. They put out a patch yesterday that helped a bunch with the AI, but it still needs plenty of work and there's little things that can get super frustrating with base management. So far, every patch they're putting out is getting all of that in order and they've been doing a good job with it.  


I have 60+ hours in the damn game already. If you enjoy survival crafters, and you like team building RPG elements, then you'll absolutely love this game. It really is a blast, but please don't stretch yourself to pick it up if it doesn't make sense. The game will always be here, and as time goes on they'll have more and more of the jank patched up.
        So I backed this game when it was still a Kickstarter. I'm saying this so you understand I'm not just on a bandwagon, I've been excited for this game for a while.


Let me preface what I'm about to say with if you don't like survival games you're not going to like this game. If you like survival games, you'll like this. If you like building games you'll like this and it'll only get better over time. If you like creature taming games you like this. And if you like Pokemon you'll probably like this too. Honestly I really hate the Pokemon with guns comparison, but in some ways this is the Pokemon game we've always wanted Nintendo to make.


Now I have sank over 200 hours since the release of the game about 2 weeks ago. In those 200 hours I can safely say that for $30 this is probably one of the greatest values of the game you can get. I say this because this is just the beginning, there's a whole island that we can see that isn't in the game yet that will be, there's nowhere to go but up for this game. There are some weird buggy AI issues, which is par for the course for any game where you have creatures in your base; I.E. Ark. But every patch has had a ton of fixes, and the game's been out for 2 weeks and they've already patched it three times. This goes to show that they do care about the project they are working on it actively, which means a $30 investment for a game that will probably increase in price later down the road 100% worth.
        The hype train isn't there just because it's pokemon, the hype train is there because they done the pokemon formula way better than official pokemon games

Also, just because a lot of people love the game doesn't mean you will, seeing as reddit commenters don't know you personally they can't recommend something based off your interests. Watch some reviews and gameplay on YouTube. If that's not enough to make your mind up, a random person on reddit telling you whether to buy it or not won't change that 😂
        It's really good. (Never played/watched Pokémon, alwaus found it stupid. Soo...this is way better than that shit game. (~~You even get to kidnap humans~~)!
        Do you have friends to play with? Get it. Do you not? Don't get it.

That's my 2c. It's a very fun game, but it's one of those games where you really need friends to truly enjoy.

Obviously please don't someone come at me with "I enjoy playing games solo" that's your prerogative my advice doesn't apply. The game's just better with friends.
            While i see the sentiment here, this might be the best crafting-survival game to play solo, since most of them feel very lonely but here you get your pals running around.
        If Ark and Rust are any indication, this is one of those games that will have active players and support for years to come.
        > Is it worth getting? 

No, it got bugs, enemies wont attack sometimes and theres lack of soul on it ~thats for me~  you can expend that money on something better for real.

Edit: you can try it out on steam and if you dont like it ask for a refund "remember you have to request before the 2 hours mark" or just play it on gamepass thats what i did.
Friend: Wheres the crafting bench?

OP: It's in the small house with orange roof.

Friend: Thanks! ... wait...
    it's over on the corner of 1st and main
        It's either this or crafting benches in every other house
            I was gonna say if there isn't a crafting bench inside each house then they're just empty and the builds trash anyways lol
                They really should have been fully furnished before moving on IMO


unrelated note I have plans for when I no longer have anything else to do in game 😂
                    I’m a builder and my long term game partner is a decorator. She can handle all the pretty plants and comfy beds, I’m gonna sit here swearing at the roofs and missing my sons of the forest system
What the Fuack ![img](emote|t5_4jn9v4|49343)
    This is why Fuack's name became one of my favorites because of this exact pun 😭😂😂
    Didn’t realize they had palworld emojis…

And they added this one! ![img](emote|t5_4jn9v4|49345) That’s hilarious
        Smart choice. The best subs have their own emojis. ![img](emote|t5_4jn9v4|49342)
    Upvote for the funny pun 😂😂😂
        I've been saying this every time I see one, it's a problem, my base is next to a Fuack'ing Fuack spawn ![img](emote|t5_4jn9v4|49350)
            me too lmao
            That bad huh? First time in a raid a certain incineram burns my wooden house down
                Luckily I only build out of rock and stone, not leaf and log like some kinda pointy eared leaf lovers.

Also, it's a blessing. I never need pal fluids, I just grab some from my Fuack'ing garden ![img](emote|t5_4jn9v4|49350)
                    For Rock and Stone!
                        For Carl
                            ROCK AND STONE TO THE BONE
                                If you don’t rock and stone, you ain’t coming home
                            Rock and Stone To The Bone
                            This comment has no where near enough up votes lol
                    I am pissed that I chose to disassemble my base… nothing followed… have had to start over again because I chose the new place beside a beach… but good thing is, I finally caught grizzbolt and found a massand lux… though the not so good thing is I haven’t researched the saddle for the grizzlebolt. Welll I guess I will settle for the grenade launcher
                        Grizzbolt harness comes decently later into the game lol, it's a long grind on default settings lol

I've relocated 3 times, and each time they've been better bases.

But until they get the base AI running properly, the best bases are as flat as possible, and as low as possible lol
                            Yeah I noticed that last night when my chubby electric mouse was hovering above my building making arrows for me and glitches all over the place like Freakazoid. Threw that yellow motherFuacker a million times before he stopped acting the micky.
                                A reset can help that if yeeting them at the job keeps saying "automatic work mode"

It sucks, but given the game is early, I'm happy to let them cook.
                                Hehehehe I am somewhat confused though it says grenade launcher in the description soooo why am I seeing rocket launchers when that skill activated? 😅
                    never build with wood.  wood burns.
                Lmfao my first base and main base for a min is at a spot that isnt easy for the Pals to invade. Idk why, they just need to jump down lol only problem i had was when Pal "Freedom" fighters popped up. They dont play lol
    We need a Fuack emote honestly.
    LMFAO! I swear to God, everytime i see one i yell out in my party; "OH, FUACK! ![img](emote|t5_4jn9v4|49345)
    Adding this to my rotation. ![img](emote|t5_4jn9v4|49342)
Decorate every house dont forget that thats another 50 hours
    I think 50 might be an understatement
Needs a massive Depresso peaking in over the wall.
    Hahahahaha or maybe a Grizzbolt
        Nah, a Tocotoco
        I like the giant goofy looking dinosaurs they are just giant derps
Pathing issues be damned
    Cant have pathing issues if theres no palbox in the first place lol
        Ah so if u disable decay, you can build anywhere?
            Yes.

You can build ANYTHING anywhere.

The Palbox is mainly a container for your pals and a designed area that they can roam in without being in your party.
                Some things can't be built like the pal condenser. Stuff that's tied to your palbox basically.
                you can't build most (or maybe all, i havent tested) things in the pal tab outside of a base
            No, if you disable decay, then the buildings that you can build everywhere dont decay anymore.
            Yeap.. Helpful if you want to cheese bosses.. Especially Frostallion. Build some walls and campfires. He walks over it and gets burn damage consistently. lol
Some people really have a LOT of time in their hands
    No. They just have mods.
        Don't think any.mods spawn houses. I use mods to speed things up. This is still insane
            >Don't think any.mods spawn houses. 


No, just unlimited resources to build everything in a couple hours.
                I got enough stone and wood to do this if I so wanted and I don’t use mods my main base has over 30,000 stone and wood
                    It’s not about having the resources, it’s about the added time/annoyance of transporting them around from/outside of your base. Even at my 1200 carry weight it’s a pain building anything sizable outside of my palbox zone carrying a few hundred stone at a time. And this area is huge
                        I'm 48 with almost all points in weight and no way am I doing this even with 5 wumpos
                    why wood?  wood burns.  one fire pal farts and the whole place goes up.
                        The roofs in the video
                    Your base Doesn't even extend that far and you would need the infinite carrying weight mod.
                        You can build outside the radius though
                            that wasn't their point. If you go outside your base you can only use up to your own weight capacity, and then you'd have to run back in to grab more.
                                Running back to grab more isn't a big deal when you can hold like 2k stone or more which will last over 10 minutes probably lol. Everything costs 3 stone. If you place down something every second it would take 11 minutes run out. You can probably place faster then 1 a second though.

If you use a potion to respec and go hard into carry capacity could probably carry 4k.

Seems only slightly harder with limited carry capacity. 10 minutes to run out and 20 seconds to back and grab 2k more.
                                If you got a fast flying mount it wouldn’t be that bad than use pals to increase max load
                                    going back and forth any distance is bad. Any time you run out of materials is an interruption to what you are currently building. You have to hold f for a few seconds, fly to storage, land, grab what you need, then fly back, hold f to get off mount, then resume building. That time going back adds up a lot.
                            Sure. But they did it with infinite carrying weight and resources Plus other mods. Hence the T-pose flying.
                                The t-pose flying is from a glitch that just got patched. Basically the glitch let you equip anything in any slot. If you equipped anything but a glider in the glider slot your glide would be replaced by a t pose
                        You can also set building deterioration to zero so anything outside doesn’t go bye bye
                            Ok.  That still has absolutely nothing to do with the point I'm making. 




Cool. They built a base in a custom game with infinite resources... It doesn't take that much time when you have the resources customly jacked up to a million percent does it?
                                By that standard none of Minecraft builds are impressive because they made it in creative or with third party tools instead of mining cobblestone for months before the project even started. 

This city is impressive not because of resources or logistics, but because building system is wonky and requires lot of finese to get it allign properly like here.
                                    That's not the point, nor is this Minecraft.  



>This city is impressive not because of resources or logistics, but because building system is wonky and requires lot of finese to get it allign properly like here.



No. It literally snaps to the foundation.
                                You can build quite a lot of stone structure on 250 stone and if there are stone nodes nearby even easier if you got a refined pick axe
                Even with unlimited resources and carry weight saying this took "a couple hours" is an understatement.
                    No it's not.  It's not Even as cool as my Legit town with decorative interiors on normal settings.
                        Agreed.
                        Strong copium
                            Lol.  I actually have friends to build with and argue over the placement of Town hall.
                                You sound so much cooler than this guy
                                    That's because I play without Mods.
                It's mods for snapping and clipping structures together. No way you get a seamless looking foundation build like this without it.

And if OP did it WITHOUT mods? Honestly even sadder.
                Even with unlimited resources and no weight concerns or anything that took way WAY more than a couple hours.
            No decay

Instant build time

Infinite resources

Flying mode.

They probably have some “creative” mod similar to minecraft too. Lol
        Or unemployment checks cashing 😂
            Some of is are playing video games while we're "working" from home. 

It's crazy because I'm doing the exact same job I was doing in the office. But my workload has gone from being slammed all day to having about 2 hours of work to get done. Then not much else to do.

It's cause the people who have chosen to stay in the office are getting the workload. Management wants to see productive workers in office so they are dumping it all on them. Meanwhile those of us at home are kicking back and playing video games on the company dime.
                That might be the case for some people, but I absolutely know people collecting unemployment to just sit around lol.
                    
Some things you may not understand

- the majority of people choose not to have their unemployment taxed. Resulting in high taxes at the beginning of the year. This ended up financially devastating many families after covid.

- in the modern workforce even three or six months of empty space in your work history is enough to remove you from most application pools

- most people who live off unemployment typically suffer from much much higher rates of depression, high blood pressure and anxiety due to their financial situation. 

If the people you know living off unemployment seem like they're happy they're lying to you. Or they're lying to themselves. It just hasn't caught up with them yet. 

But once the unemployment runs out, the taxes are due and jobs refuse to hire them you will see how quickly they spiraled down. It's going to hit them hard and the longer they're on unemployment the worse it's going to be.

We recently had 2 years of millions of Americans on unemployment to back this up. Your friends are screwing themselves lol
        The resources arent the problem 😂😂

How is it Possible to build on such a large area, isnt it restricted to where Your Pal Box is located?
    No, you can build almost anywhere, palbox just allows you to pull from chest inside the area. All he must have had to do was keep the stone and wood on his person to build
        Idk about single player, but on MP servers you would have to have the decay rate set to 0 so buildings outside the pal box zone don't eventually disappear.
            Same with single player.  

I have it set to 0 on mine so I can build bridges.

Edit: https://i.imgur.com/IBDoX1l.jpg
                Wait, how do you build bridges? Wouldn't it complain about lack of support quite fast?
                    Can't do very high birdges, only ones that's like 3-4 characters tall. 

I raise the foundation as high as possible and build up from there.  Once bridge is built across I delete every other foundation to skip so you can walk under it.
                        can you do this over water
                Omg that's a great idea 💡
                Updating settings now
                Haha is that why my one wooden gate blocking the bridge leading to my base keeps disappearing? Dang.
            this is possible? I have to check it because on my private server stuff decays
            You can turn that off
        WAIT so I can make myself a proper home instead of a shitty little 2x2 shack that fits perfectly on the inside of the edge of my pal box's border?
            Yes, just make sure to edit your world settings. When things are built outside of the palbox radius, they decay. After a few in game days, the structure collapses. The materials drop to the ground.

This helps reduce lag especially in MP servers. That way, the server does not have to calculate every building the players built all the time. Once the decay timer runs out, server destroys the building and that frees up memory.
                Well that explains why the walls around my base kept disappearing. I thought it was all the raids I just ignore XD
                    Yup. Found this out the hard way too. I built a tall castle with one side outside the build radius. Then one time when I logged in, I noticed that part to be missing. My pals already collected the dropped materials and stored them away.

I built it up again, thinking it's wild pals intruding (I have raids disabled). Then it happened again after a few in game days.

I only figured it out while helping a friend edit their own world settings and saw the building decay option.
                What about height of your structure? If it's within the palbox radius, is there a height where decay may start? 
                    The radius is a cylinder, not a sphere, so height doesn't matter.
            Look at this rich guy with 2x2s. When I was your age entire families with their pals lived in a 1x1.
        Im wondering, if i put things outsides of the blue circle, do my pal goes there ? For example if i put a berries field, will they auto harvest for example ?
            No
            No Pokémon’s only go in the blue circle
                It's Pals but thank you, i was curious
                    Pokemon. You won't change my mind.
                *Palemons
                    it's just pals
                    Pokepals. They're pocket pals.
Bro built a city for 1 person
Are you..are you role playing PalWorld as an evil real estate development tycoon?

I’ve got a 1x1 wooden square with a bed in it. 😭. 

32 player hide and seek and Pal contests be amazing here though. Kudos.
    Rule, everyone needs to have a relaxosorus out at all times, so seeker can get hints of hiders by their pals clipping out of houses
    watch attack on titan
    A palworld custom game browser would be dope
When you were crafting the 1000th identical stone house, did you wonder why have I done this?
    You’re living in an age where people spend thousands of hours to place millions of blocks in Minecraft, just to make basic shapes that really big.
Damn, my boy has built Shiganshina
    i was thinking Mitras 😭
    Now I can't unsee it
Bro built Rome in a day
    Needs to be higher
canada's housing ministers wants to know your location
    Lol, not enough soviet style apartment complexes or homeless pals.
No Bugs with that much buildings? I built Like 4 or 5 in my Base and i thought i will get problems. Beides that all the time Spawn two mamoreth in my Base and fight and destroy my half Base 😪
    And No problems with decay?
        You can disable decay
        thats a toggable setting, you can build as much u want outside by change decay damage to zero
        Decay can be turned off in world settings.
Hiw much time did it take? And are you mentally okay?
    Can you explain the significance of this post to someone who hasn’t played Pal? What’s with all the “op is insane” “how much free time do you have” comments?
        It would take a long time to collect the materials required and then build the whole city you see him show.  Most people build a small like 4x4 hut, not a giant sprawling walled city.
        That city they're flying over - the whole thing, both neighborhoods connected by a bridge - does not exist in-game. Including the floor. They built the ENTIRE thing - the stone streets, the stairs, the walls, the gates, EVERY house.... I can't recall if the castle is a pre-existing landmark or not, but EVERYTHING else made of stone in that video was built. Which means they also had to collect all of the resources to build them. And if cement is one of those resources, then bones are an ingredient, which means they farmed the shit out of certain Pals to gather that resource.
        I have like 70hrs in this game and I can't even begin to imagine how long this took. This project must have taken several dozen hours of irl time, and that's just to build it. To make it even worse, the building system in this game is awful (early access, so it should improve). I'm actually mindblown by this with everyone else

Also, the ingredients required to do this would be another couple dozen hours. However, based on their pal they are probably at end game, maybe max level, so they probably didn't have to actively farm any ingredients to build this and just had it lying around
        This is a ridiculous and unnecessary amount of building. And way outside what you can normally fit in a base, so he obviously turned off the setting that makes buildings get automatically destroyed over time if they arent inside a safe zone that you can build a limited amount of. 

Plus, theres no real function to what he built, since you can live out of like a 1x1 little house that has a bed in it and have everything else outside in the dirt.
I wish I could play half as much as you do, enjoy it and don’t take it for granted good man.

Gorgeous build.
i feel like the t-pose was on purpose
My brother in Christ, the games only been out *two weeks*. 

As someone who binged AoT the days before palworld, I approve.
*Lucky alpha blazamut appears* on that day humanity received a grim reminder
To answer some of the questions:

The structure deteriorates or decay is off or turned to 0 so anything I build outside the palbox circle doesnt disappear.

Yes all houses where built one by one and there is no mod or preset assets used. Its a tiring process but when you get the hang of it. You’re like playing fortnite.

I didnt use any mods for infinite resources nor weight capacity. I have 150hrs of gameplay and I think half of the game time is afk while my pal is mining ores and stones so thats where I got the stones. I breed a lot of anubis and luckily for me to get artisan and work slave passive. Just leave your PC open for 5-6 hrs and you’ll be surprise how many stones they can get. I carried 500-600 stones and 50 cements when I did the exterior walls, and carried 800 stones when doing the foundation and house. I mostly got all the roofing materials from the trees present in the map. But yeah its a lot returning from point a to point b.

I just posted the video for fun since I’ve finished the game already and just finished watching aot so I thought of making the city in the game. In fact I plan to do the upper portion of the map, and the whole island but thats for next week. 

My biggest mistake was I accidentally max the HP of objects making tree cutting a hell. I have to chop 8 times instead of 2 times to cut the tree. I restarted the game and minimize the HP of object but sadly the tree still takes 8 attacks to be destroyed. Apparently the effect will take place once a new batch of object respawns and existing or previous objects will not be affected. I dont know I’m mistaken or not but please correct me or leave a comment if I’m doing something wrong.

No there are no interior decorations because that will take a lot of time to make. 

Foundations blocks the spawn of objects but pal will spawn even on roofs. Funny thing is the syndicate base spawns which coincides the house. 

The building and snapping mechanics is still wacky and most of the connection from elevation to another elevation is mostly trial and error to make it look seamless. You can fortnite your way when making a ladder just make sure you have a wall. I tried covering the ugly connections using the defensive wall since they dont require snapping and you can stack them.

Yes I exploted the T pose bug since its funny and I’m trying to imitate pain’s shinra tensei from naruto.
very great,very nice  


now let's see paul allen's turn where he destroy his giant stone base piece by piece to upgrade to steel
Wish I got all that time 😅
LOL THE SHINRA TENSEI AT THE END
    Know pain
Funny thing is I feel like we're still in the early Minecraft like stage of building where people just build big things for the sake of big things, I can't wait to see build's in a few months times, I feel like building will only get better and better🔥
    Problem is lack of tools and shapes. One roof gable type, no gambled corners, no pillars or archway, no butresses or trusses. You get the idea. People have been building in MC for years and could certainly build some great stuff right out of the box in Palworld. But without the freedom of voxels, we desperately need better building tools.
        I’ve seen people get creative with roofs and stairs already to make slanted rafter looking supports in bigger buildings. We just have to learn the secret techs
Crazy how people will build stuff like this and then put their pals in work camps
Doesn’t count if they are all empty though
Get help. Also, this is glorious.
"On that day, Palworld received a grim reminder."
Now you just need a raid of a bunch of Ralaxaurus doing titan runs toward the city.
Reminds me of wall Maria rose and sina
We need a Titan Pal

Also the end looks like when Pain from Naruto used Shinra Tensai at the leaf village
    Yes the palworld shall know pain
There are games with way better building elements than palworld lol
Are you using a mod that increases the size of your camp, or makes it so structures outside its boundaries? Or does the camp size increase at higher levels in vanilla?
    Decay is off
So... you decided to make a maze of random houses?
    Scenery. Castle needs to rule over something ig
Just...how?
🎶 Sind sie das essen? Nein, wir sind der Jäger
[deleted]
took me a min to realize this would just be an empty beach if this anime person didnt use slavework or whatever
    That's the thing, they didn't use any slave work here. Housing structure pieces are build instantly, no pal needed. Unless you're referring to the gathering of the materials, then yea LOL
Hovering over your creation in the most dominant pose, where would we be without this game lol
Addicted to palworld? Maybe. Addicted to attack on titan? Definitely.
I wonder how many slaves it took to build this
I can certainly say it's alot of grinding. but I'm more of a details kind of man, is every building furnished? where are your pals?  do they work around the city?   


the start of the video, impressive. yes. but I lose alot of that once you scale out tbh as it just looked like empty cookie cutter houses.   


spice it up a bit with markets, pals. etc. really make it feel like a city
Now stack defensive stone walls on top of each other to turn it in AOT style
TSUSAGEIO TSUSAGEIO
Reminds me of Attack on Titan
I'm assuming you kept moving pal box and mats? Seems crazy to build this outside a palbox circle.
Do you like palworld?

yes.

how much?

...
How do you prevent structures outside your base to get destroyed? After awhile they do.. is this modded?
Home colonized palapagos islands
* Sie sind das Essen, wir sind die Jäger*.
[deleted]
Is that attack on titan music in the background?
Doesn’t the buildings decay if placed outside of the blue circle for the palbox?
Does it stop spawn?
Why is she Jesus Christ at the end?
Houses filled with all the friends you made along the way
I'm guessing they are using a world setting to disable building decay? I haven't used any settings, so I am unfamiliar with them.
    Yes
How do you keep everything from deteriorating that is outside the base circle?
    Decay is off
Isn't most of that going to disappear over time? Structures outside base radius deteriorate.
    Decay is off
How many trips back to base were you making to make this?
Question for those that maybe in the know. 

If you have your base built outside of the palbox region and have a bed there, are you still able to sleep in the bed?
How do you do this? My game deletes all structures outside base confines when I save and reload
I forgot you can build outside of your base. This is incredible
I hope decay is off
Please tell me you don’t play alone. Please.
    I do
whats the limit??? I thought there was a limit to how much you can build. Its great if theres none
lol I feel like this is every public server I’ve tried to join to play with friends so we can actually play together without a host having to always be online, there’s never anywhere to build
IT'S ONLY 2 FUCKING WEEKS, YOU MANIAC!!!
I think I might need a brake from palworld. I don't remember being this addicted to a game in my life!
Kind of scary how effective it is at holding my attention for days on end.
This is honestly sad. Hope you played with friends at least.
    Solo
I was honestly expecting a third, even more expansive city
Did you get the foundations to actually fit to the staircases when you go down a level or did you have to place them so it *mostly* looks like its connected?
Omg bro is building King’s Landing so he can fly over it like that one scene in GoT before it sucked.
How did you keep stuff from despawning ?
    There's a setting in game/server settings for deterioration
How is the base so big? My pal box circle is like the size of 4 of those houses
    You can build most things outside the pal box circle. Only a handful of things have to be in the circle. The catch is the server setting for base deterioration needs to be turned off or they'll decay.
Folks be going crazy with some stunning beautiful and humongous building design... And I'm just sitting here ~150 hours in with a 2x1 stone shack just to have a place to put my bed... We are not the same.
    2x1? Extravagant. 

I have a 1-foundation, 1-wall (with window!), 1-roof platform for my bed.
There’s no way you farmed all the mats. Holy smokes.
    Nvm it’s all stone. So it’s doable.
Shinzo wo sasageyo!
and then all the pals get stuck on the first set of stairs and starve to death
Put a billion chests in every house and one egg then scavenger hunt
I mean at least he is touching grass in Palworld lmaoo
Damn dude has his own section 8 housing
How are people able to make bases this big?
    It's not within a base radius. Most things can be built outside of a base radius, but you'll want to make sure your server/game settings have building deterioration turned off.
I’m not addicted
Worst part is the building is kinda ass in this game...
I know it’s still early access but I do hope they update the flight animation to something less static
Now I need this to be an actual town with NPCs and caught pals chilling around
Do you put all 3 palboxes together for this kinda stuff? Or is it just a long process of moving all your resources to a good spot then building?
I just lost my 87 hour save last night after a blue screen, seeing this made me hurt inside cause I attempted similar builds lol
Now imagine being able to expand the papbox range to that size xD the factorys i would build would be much better then the current one im doing
[deleted]
Meanwhile my base is just every next tech upgrade placed where it fits
is there a config that you tweaked to allow for the constructed things to not decay? or was the base area extended somehow?
    It's one of the server/game settings - Deterioration rate i believe. if 0, then no decay outside base radius
lol, yeah, quite literally addicted to game mechanics mastered over decades to be addicting.
Omg I actually aspire to get this far (not even done with the video yet). I'm impressed and I'm attatched to this game fr 😭💜
How brave of you to build outside of your palbox where builds decay slowly
    Decay is off
While gliding if you hold F, your flying pal will grab you out of the air.
In 100 years an Apex Relaxasaurus is going to kick down the walls
I feel like a JRPG hero with spikey hair is gonna show up and then get caught up in a series of events that leads to them saving the world.
Dude...you should go outside
Damn these sprawling suburbs developers
It's a shame that will auto destroy in short time
How do you have the walls actually lining up nicely? Do the stone ones snap together?
That second town really is the beginnings of attack on titan
Placing those roofs would give me a headache id quit for that alone the snapping is terrible
![gif](giphy|vWku8YNwyy5vq|downsized)
How is your base so big? All I’m allowed to build is in a small circle?
What level is that tall wall?
What 0 decay rate does to an MF
brah its called Palworld not Pal City, christ almighty.
Did you use a mod to expand base territory? Please share your secrets
Wouldn’t this all decay? Are you playing with that stat turned off?
    Yes
Your Scientists Were So Preoccupied With Whether Or Not They Could, They Didn’t Stop To Think If They Should
Is that Babylon? Sheesh
This reminds me of when the town rearranged when Gildarts came back to fairy tail
Addicted is such a strong word. It’s the right word, just strong…
I THOUGHT U FOUND A SECRET CIVILIZATION I NEVER SAW BEFORE but then i saw
Do the base circles get that big, later in the game???
Watch the save get corrupted or cloud not sync 😂
How’d you even manage this? If a corner of a building is outside my circle it randomly is gone each day
Ok how many hours logged in? :o
    150 hrs, quarter of the time is game is open for my pals to gather resources
So I’ve heard about this game a bit over the past couple weeks but this is my first time actually seeing a clip of it.. 

My impression of reading was that it was Pokémon 2.0.  I was picturing some cutesy style cartoon game with adorable monsters that you battled ppl with.  WTF is this?  Lmao. A city building game? XD
How do you keep those structures outside your base from breaking down over time
The streets are more empty then downtown Pyongyang
Are you able to expand your base area later on? I feel the circle the Pal box gives isnt big enough for that
Winterhold?
T pose to assess dominance
The last two days I've worked came home ate and then played palworld for about 8 hours then ate again and slept lol. 

Not many games can I actually play for more than an hour or two.
What mods are you using for this? No way you ran around with all that stone in your pockets over encumbered
How do you transport all that material
That is actually sick and you could even get 20 “citizens” to live there
Bro built attack on titan didnt it😂🤣
Really gotta appreciate this level of commitment and dedication, bravo m8
How do you have your base that big?
How are people building outside of base lines without everything disintegrating over time?
Bro is developing new content.
Bro built wall Maria
My game would have crashed 90 times during that flight
This is most likely just single player, but if u did this on a server I be piss you took all that space ;p
My food has been reduced to cornflakes and the pals is now my real life pals :D
And here I am not even able to get the stairs to connect to each other
At first i thought he made his own city like in Pokemon, then i saw the REST OF IT.
I would be more addicted if I didn't have to spend so much time managing my base Pals and the resources they're supposed to generate. Maybe I'm missing something that's built into the game and just wasn't explicitly called out, but my stupid ass Pals are constantly putting stacks of rock and wood in my rare resources chest or egg chest by my incubator, even though they had to walk past 3 other chests on the way there. They're leaving ranch resources just sitting on the ground, like come on, just put the milk and eggs in the fridge!

I lose so much time just because my Pals aren't doing their jobs the right way
Damn, free pal aliance was speaking the truth in this case….
Then someone comes along and deletes it because it's outside the blue circle
My computer is actively on fire just from watching this.
Well i guess that answers my question about build limit
i jsut pray for your sake when they implement public servers they dont wipe your world.
Would be a shame if that was online and somebody had a torch
They need to give us color options, and also add some more NPCs for us to catch to make part of our base lol.
Me building a house and some cool structures in my palbox perimeter: 😊

Then there's this mf over turning a whole ass island into a kingdom.
Bro lives in the Cloud District.
bro really ready to inv every player over to his server
This guy is making the capital of the damn Clover Kingdom. 💀🔥
Jesus dude take a shower
How do you prevent the building from decaying?
    You can set the decay setting to 0 in your World Settings
        Found it, it's called "BuildObjectDeteriorationDamageRate"
I really hope you have structure decay set to 0
    Bruh if he didnt the other half of the town would decay while hes working and he would be building nonstop for the rest of his life, in a circle trying to catch up to the decay rate
Tell me that you like Attack on Titan without telling me you like Attack on Titan.
I just live out in the open with all my shit scattered about the only building being a 1x1 for my bed
This is soooo impressive. Is there a guide somewhere for building bases? I'm so bad at it. I see what I wanna do but when I try to build something it just ends up being simple single floor shacks-- with a roof at least!
    Just practice and trial and error.
Bruh... their building system sucks. How the hell 😂😂😂 I just can't get into the building and you made a village.
" How many mods do you have ? "

" Yes. "
    No mods actually
Look, I llove the game, too. And I love building in games. But I absolutely hate building in this game. You should try putting this time and energy in a game with a decent building system like Valheim or modded Ark.
[deleted]
    Being addicted is playing the game as much as you want. Doesn't matter what you do in game so long as you're playing it.

Let people have their fun.
    > Being addicted is more about to maxing out a Pal.

That's just part of it. You can still be addicted to the game, but to other aspects versus just getting max pals and best gear.
I mean, sure it looks impressive, but they're clearly playing with no decay, exploiting a bug for extra armor/no glider, and probably have the resources never dry up w/ a ton of drops. They're not really playing Palworld. They're cheating and playing the Sims with extra steps.
Yeah, but thats just visual. Not useful.
    It's a video game. It's literally all useless. 

That's why you play for fun, and not usefulness.
Nothing special when cheating your way through. For one your base area isnt even this large to begin with. Easy to build without limits.
    You can technically put all 3 bases next to each other to functionally increase the size. 

That said, all this does is turn off structure decay so you can build outside the ring. Fairly certain the actual base ring can’t be increased and your pals will not use stations or path outside that ring; same goes for your base resources. It’s purely decorative so I don’t see how it’s cheating. I guess you can say he spawned in or bumped up numbers to get infinite resources, but I’d be shocked if the game doesn’t have a “creative mode” at some point anyway. Even with all the resources in the world it takes time and effort to make a build that looks good, especially with a building system as archaic and limited as this game.
This is obviously modded so. You don’t love it enough to not play it organically
Yea nah you need go outside this isn't healthy
I’ve only played for a few hours, but I’m hoping for metal fencing. After only seeing trailers, I named my world Palschwitz.
Idk why I just can’t get into Palworld. It just feels like a cheap game. I want to like it!!!!!
    It ain't cheap it's just made by a smaller team of developers. They went into mad debt tryna make a fun game. Looks like it paid off because it is fun.
        I need to give it another try. Idk what it is
            [deleted]
This game is not as good s Pokémon...
Nooooooo 😂
Now you need to do all the interiors
My console would just straight up die
How the fuck, what the fuck, why the fuck, the fuck?
Oh hell no!!
Any advice to stop stutters and memory leaks causing fps drops until relaunch?
SI
The Lovander Pal Deck entry and the fact you can catch and keep humans is astounding 😳, but I love this game a lot! I'm pretty addicted, and I'm not stopping anytime soon! 😁❤️❤️
All i pucture is poor depresso having to navigate the streets dragging a piece of wood just to put it in the box.
Honestly, this makes me want to turn of degradation outside base lines and just be a bit creative with my bases
How is the space so large?
bro created a civilization inside the game lol
I'd love to see someone do sth like this on vanilla
    Need custom difficulty to turn off building degradation outside of a base or you'll have no where near enough space to build....
Holy shiiiiiiiiii…. That looks amazing
even got the floating T pose at the end. nice
I was gonna share my little village but then I saw this  😭
Noooo I don't want that!
Attack on titan.
And I thought I was addicted.
How are you doing it that this stuff dont vanish after an day? Did you put your 3 palboxes in your town or its modded?

Because if i build something out of my palbox it goes away after some time :-/ Playing on my own private dedicated server.
Me thinks some people are probably playing the game differently than I am.
Im gonna show this to my wife so she can understand im in control
Yall must not have seen the upcoming stone eating pal.
Meanwhile I still haven't bothered to figure out how to put sloped roofs on *one* building much less hundreds of them.
Bruh
You Win.
Noice![img](emote|t5_4jn9v4|49347)
“Well I’ve done that befo….. oh…”
Looking forward to more quality of life updates, but I’m actually balancing this and enshrouded enjoying both a lot xD
My condolences 😞🙏
Wall Maria shall fall
My god, how many hours?
I spend almost all my time messing around and just exploring. (I also play on 3 different worlds/servers) but i only play for like 2-3 hours (and this was before the xbox update so most of my time was spent dealing with crashes). I gotta play more seriously cause i now know where everything is i want 😭 high ass lvl pals are too fire
k. I'm scared. Plz mommy, make the crazy man go awayy!
Anyone else waiting for the titans to arrive?
I was gonna make a joke about a titan attacking someday and then i turned the audio of the video xDD
Guess i wasnt wrong
The raid spawns alredy on the city.
Jesus. I'm at the point where I don't rlly know what to do anymore. 

You clearly got enough things to think of
Looks like Attack on Titan lol
The worst part is having to either repair all of that outside the blue circle constantly or just accept its a temporary thing.
Dawg made wall rose and wall maria
WHAT THE FUCK! haha this is insane.
I do hope that every house is decorated.
How much time did it take to build all of that?
Dude really built the Imperial City in Palworld.
Bro is insane
attack on titan is that you
Bro built Bah Sing Sai
Bros playing attack on titan
Shame there are no humans to live in these buildings lol
Nani?!
Not at all
I dont play the game and i dont think i will but out of curiosity does that pokemon actually fly like its from mobile game? Looks like a bad pc mod port of mobile model.
The video quality really takes away from the experience.
That is all gonna deteriorate
Its not gonna be so fun when the titans attack
It's the aot city
Honestly it's great that you're this dedicated and it's a fun build.

I just wish Palworld building wasn't so terrible as to really let you shine.

Lonely.

I'm Mr. lonely.

 I have nobody.

For my own.

What the fuck 😶
My friend really invested, i like it

Difference?

He got a base and plan moves and stuff

I got a pal station and stuff in a circle, oh and a wall, they work and eat and sleep

I dont bother making village / house...not till it become real relevant.
At first I was like wow thats really cool how is there base so big...

Then I was, HOLY SH!T thats amazing!
Yes addicted, but Not THAT addicted.
the bloodline level town
Sasageyo
And here I was proud of my 6 by 6 stone house with a bed and a bathroom.
My Steam Deck is having a nervous breakdown.
You're human, it's only natural.
They really need update the server size so we can have guild vs guild pvp
Shinra Tensei!
Holy shit!
lol random jank game somehow handles mass building better than Valheim did.
This island isn’t on the ma-….oh god.
What are the mortgages like in your neighborhood?
Trost district
I was awe on first tour then dropped Jaw on the 2nd tour
How is your base that big? Did you mod it so you can have unlimited range for the base?
Sir. Sir. I think you may have a problem.
Bro create Pal City
I can't wait until we get paths/roads...
Idk why but when you zoom out my head played "oh my God it's Jason bourne"
Incredible, but also makes me wish me had more building options, looks so barebones right now. Has so much potential.
r/urbanhell
Holy shit that's San Bernardino
On that day. Humanity received a grim reminder
Lifeless and empty 💀
Anyone else have the glitch that anything out side your base circle will slowly take damage and eventually destroy itself?
Aspirational.

Who needs Minecraft when you have Palworld?
It will all get destroyed in a few days trust me unless you make the world settings off
I imagine there's a creative mode setting? I suppose if you have a farm making walls isn't too bad unless cement was also needed
    Nah those walls are just 3 stone a piece. A farm or two running 24/7 would get you enough stone in like a day, maybe two or three idk I didn't count, if you design it well and your pals don't path themselves to an early grave. I left mine running overnight and came back ~14 hours later to 9999 stone.
        ~~3~~ 10 stone + 1 cement.



That's a lot of bones. 👀
            How else do you build the empire?
            Stone walls are just 3 stone no cement tho. 

Are we talking defensive stone walls? I thought we were talking about the walls and foundations to make all the buildings if not my bad. 
                Oops, my bad, I thought we were talking about defensive walls (which are 10 stone + 1 cement.) 
^Corrected ^my ^original ^comment.



You are correct, those are only 3 stone. Which, there's A LOT here! 


This build really *rocks*... I'll see myself out...
                    To be fair to you though there still are a TON of defensive walls in that bitch!
                    You should be stoned for that one
            Easier to just buy bones from the merchant NPC.

Tatakae…Tatakae
Oh my god! Its the lucky titan! Ruuuuun
First thought after they flew up too lol.
OP better watch out for the rumbling
With future mods having an absolutely enormous relaxasaurus lux raiding the base would be hilarious....

Attack from titan?

Make your own enormous pals? Evangelion?
You summed it up pretty well I must say
    I love this game but my god there are such better games for building. Building in this game feels really unfinished. I can't imagine spending this much time wrestling with the build system.
        It's been out for a month on early access. Ark was janky too. Just give it time. Building is easy when you know how the broken system works lol
            “That slanted wall doesn’t fit here. Maybe if I remove this wall and these stairs…. Oh, Oops. I guess we’re living in a bungalow now.”
                I had problems with slanted roofs, but if you put a piece down like making a ramp up to the where you need it, it clicks in. Then just delete what you don't want
                    I think the slanted roofs are intended to be placed on top of the flat roof. It's the only way the snap point makes sense to me.
                        As someone who builds roofs. Yes, the slanted pieces go on top of the flat part.
                            As someone who roofs, the flat part that the slanted part goes on is in fact— also slanted.
                                That’s just semantics. Everything is slanted in one way of another.
                                As someone who roofies, a slan...where are you guys going?
                        For an early access with the potential of tons of expansion, and patches - it’s pretty damn good.  It’s an amazing foundation that could have a ton of possibilities.
                Multi-level stairs have been my major building annoyance. It seems like they just don't want to snap to the roof unless I'm standing at just the right angle
            Hasn’t it only been 2 weeks?
                Yes
            Honestly, Ark is jankier than this even after years. Still love it, though.
            I mean building in ark is still ass also.
                It is, but it got better. Hopefully this one improves
                    Agreed it DID improve.
I’m hoping for more of a Conan level glow up on the building to be honest.

I understand that this is basically ARK were your dinosaurs can work.
But that’s kind of my issue right now.
They should be shooting for Conan with animals…. And less boobs.
                        Eh I think the gameplay to boob ratio is fine tbh
                Ascended really fixed up the building. I enjoy it a lot more now.
            I've been playing ark since the Xbox early access, the early early stages were so fucked sometimes. Couldn't place foundation because of terrain but it's on a flat surface.

Dinos wandering off never to return.

Accidentally using the wrong whistle and now all your dinos are a mile away.

Atleast pals stay in the base lol
                My biggest wish, is flying pals to land. I really wanna see my birbs hop around.
            Ark was janky until a mod came out that did it better then they just added it to the base game.
            Omg it was made by the guys who made ARK!?!? No wonder I had this familiar but unsettling feeling.
        It’s almost like it’s an early access game lmfao
        Give it some time, it barely hatched.
        It’s almost like this game has only been out a few weeks on early access
Kept thinking how I could never live without palworld by my side~
    But then I spent so many nights, thinking how it did me wrong...
        And I grew my pals strong and learned how to ride along..
            Now I'm back, from an hour's sleep;

Just spawned in to find my Pals are all sick and weak;
                I should have never logged out 


I should have never went to sleep
                    If I had know for just one second how long that it would take..  
to make those meds! those fucking meds!.
                        Don't lay around town, I just built you 15 beds!
                            and I got all these spheres to give and built a farm to raise your kids
                                I think I have the strongest foxparks, but then I meet Mammorest and he only barks
                            Go on now, go! Walk through the floor!

Just stand around now. 'Cause you're not working anymore.

            Your goal was to abuse an exploit that isn't going to be there on the full release? Weird flex but okay.
At first I was horrified, and then I was like "maybe they're playing the wrong game lmao"
My literal thoughts. Went from jaw dropped to concerned eyebrows within seconds.
Is it worth getting? I’m on a tight budget and I’ve been wanting to buy it but I’m afraid I won’t like it and people are just on the hype train cause Pokémon
    It incorporates a lot of different game elements that are not just Pokemon. As far as new games go it is an incredible value at $30.
        well, it's not really new either.  it's ark+ pokemon mainly, with a few elements from breath of the wild.  i dont think they're doing anything new other than combining already understood concepts.

that being said, it's definitely fun.  however if you've already extensively played ark then there you'll find much of the game to be almost the same.  i haven't so it seems fresher than it is to me.

agree it's pretty good value for $30 but you do end up having to work around many of the faults in the game too.  if this were a triple a studio it would be viewed much differently.
            If it were a AAA studio it'd be worse and there wouldn't have been any patches to address issues for three months, and they'd be selling us pals with good passives via microtransaction... or just have us random draw them.
                eh, this is definitely far buggier than my expectations and is riddled with obvious issues, such as a pretty stale gameplay loop and copy paste elements from other games.  this game can easily be monetized more so maybe that's the main difference you're seeing.

im only talking to talk.  it's the right use of the early access tag and the devs seem to be reasonable people atm.  everyone likes to support what they see as a good thing but let's be honest, gamers make bad decisions with their money and this can easily become another in a long line of games that did the exact same thing.
            Okay. But it is still a new game. Incorporating other games’ concepts doesn’t make it not a new game lol.
                As a percentage, how much of the game would you say is new?  And what are those new concepts?
                    It’s arguing a moot point. Who cares. It is a new game that incorporates pieces of other games into it to create something fun. There’s no point arguing semantics of newness. It is a new game for $30 with known concepts.
                        this is a discussion.  but if you aren't able to answer the question then we do not have to continue
    It's worth every penny imo. I'm a big fan of Minecraft, Pokemon, and a myriad of RPGs and this scratches all those sweet spots. Obviously it's buggy since it's still pre-release, but tbh I've seen "finished" games with more bugs. The headaches don't come anywhere near superseding the experience overall. I wasn't even planning on touching this game because same with money issues but I saw ibxtoycat trying it out and it just seemed so much more engaging and rich than I would've ever expected.

Edit: I have it on PC, from what I see console could have different issues for you to overcome so I can't speak to that experience. Just to be clear.
        Let’s be clear, about 30 hours into my world or so my entire save just disappeared gone bye bye. I’d still say this is the best 30$$ I’ve ever spent. (Hours down the rabbit hole lead to finding a way to get your save back.)
        > but tbh I've seen "finished" games with more bugs

Cyberpunk 2077 comes to mind for me. But CD Projekt Red did the right thing and fixed the myriad of issues. It's a great game now. Well, It was great at launch too if you just looked past the glitchyness.
    If your budget is tight, it might be worth waiting a bit until you feel better about buying it. They put out a patch yesterday that helped a bunch with the AI, but it still needs plenty of work and there's little things that can get super frustrating with base management. So far, every patch they're putting out is getting all of that in order and they've been doing a good job with it.  


I have 60+ hours in the damn game already. If you enjoy survival crafters, and you like team building RPG elements, then you'll absolutely love this game. It really is a blast, but please don't stretch yourself to pick it up if it doesn't make sense. The game will always be here, and as time goes on they'll have more and more of the jank patched up.
    So I backed this game when it was still a Kickstarter. I'm saying this so you understand I'm not just on a bandwagon, I've been excited for this game for a while.


Let me preface what I'm about to say with if you don't like survival games you're not going to like this game. If you like survival games, you'll like this. If you like building games you'll like this and it'll only get better over time. If you like creature taming games you like this. And if you like Pokemon you'll probably like this too. Honestly I really hate the Pokemon with guns comparison, but in some ways this is the Pokemon game we've always wanted Nintendo to make.


Now I have sank over 200 hours since the release of the game about 2 weeks ago. In those 200 hours I can safely say that for $30 this is probably one of the greatest values of the game you can get. I say this because this is just the beginning, there's a whole island that we can see that isn't in the game yet that will be, there's nowhere to go but up for this game. There are some weird buggy AI issues, which is par for the course for any game where you have creatures in your base; I.E. Ark. But every patch has had a ton of fixes, and the game's been out for 2 weeks and they've already patched it three times. This goes to show that they do care about the project they are working on it actively, which means a $30 investment for a game that will probably increase in price later down the road 100% worth.
    The hype train isn't there just because it's pokemon, the hype train is there because they done the pokemon formula way better than official pokemon games

Also, just because a lot of people love the game doesn't mean you will, seeing as reddit commenters don't know you personally they can't recommend something based off your interests. Watch some reviews and gameplay on YouTube. If that's not enough to make your mind up, a random person on reddit telling you whether to buy it or not won't change that 😂
    It's really good. (Never played/watched Pokémon, alwaus found it stupid. Soo...this is way better than that shit game. (~~You even get to kidnap humans~~)!
    Do you have friends to play with? Get it. Do you not? Don't get it.

That's my 2c. It's a very fun game, but it's one of those games where you really need friends to truly enjoy.

Obviously please don't someone come at me with "I enjoy playing games solo" that's your prerogative my advice doesn't apply. The game's just better with friends.
        While i see the sentiment here, this might be the best crafting-survival game to play solo, since most of them feel very lonely but here you get your pals running around.
    If Ark and Rust are any indication, this is one of those games that will have active players and support for years to come.
    > Is it worth getting? 

No, it got bugs, enemies wont attack sometimes and theres lack of soul on it ~thats for me~  you can expend that money on something better for real.

Edit: you can try it out on steam and if you dont like it ask for a refund "remember you have to request before the 2 hours mark" or just play it on gamepass thats what i did.
it's over on the corner of 1st and main
    It's either this or crafting benches in every other house
        I was gonna say if there isn't a crafting bench inside each house then they're just empty and the builds trash anyways lol
            They really should have been fully furnished before moving on IMO


unrelated note I have plans for when I no longer have anything else to do in game 😂
                I’m a builder and my long term game partner is a decorator. She can handle all the pretty plants and comfy beds, I’m gonna sit here swearing at the roofs and missing my sons of the forest system
This is why Fuack's name became one of my favorites because of this exact pun 😭😂😂
Didn’t realize they had palworld emojis…

And they added this one! ![img](emote|t5_4jn9v4|49345) That’s hilarious
    Smart choice. The best subs have their own emojis. ![img](emote|t5_4jn9v4|49342)
Upvote for the funny pun 😂😂😂
    I've been saying this every time I see one, it's a problem, my base is next to a Fuack'ing Fuack spawn ![img](emote|t5_4jn9v4|49350)
        me too lmao
        That bad huh? First time in a raid a certain incineram burns my wooden house down
            Luckily I only build out of rock and stone, not leaf and log like some kinda pointy eared leaf lovers.

Also, it's a blessing. I never need pal fluids, I just grab some from my Fuack'ing garden ![img](emote|t5_4jn9v4|49350)
                For Rock and Stone!
                    For Carl
                        ROCK AND STONE TO THE BONE
                            If you don’t rock and stone, you ain’t coming home
                        Rock and Stone To The Bone
                        This comment has no where near enough up votes lol
                I am pissed that I chose to disassemble my base… nothing followed… have had to start over again because I chose the new place beside a beach… but good thing is, I finally caught grizzbolt and found a massand lux… though the not so good thing is I haven’t researched the saddle for the grizzlebolt. Welll I guess I will settle for the grenade launcher
                    Grizzbolt harness comes decently later into the game lol, it's a long grind on default settings lol

I've relocated 3 times, and each time they've been better bases.

But until they get the base AI running properly, the best bases are as flat as possible, and as low as possible lol
                        Yeah I noticed that last night when my chubby electric mouse was hovering above my building making arrows for me and glitches all over the place like Freakazoid. Threw that yellow motherFuacker a million times before he stopped acting the micky.
                            A reset can help that if yeeting them at the job keeps saying "automatic work mode"

It sucks, but given the game is early, I'm happy to let them cook.
                            Hehehehe I am somewhat confused though it says grenade launcher in the description soooo why am I seeing rocket launchers when that skill activated? 😅
                never build with wood.  wood burns.
            Lmfao my first base and main base for a min is at a spot that isnt easy for the Pals to invade. Idk why, they just need to jump down lol only problem i had was when Pal "Freedom" fighters popped up. They dont play lol
We need a Fuack emote honestly.
LMFAO! I swear to God, everytime i see one i yell out in my party; "OH, FUACK! ![img](emote|t5_4jn9v4|49345)
Adding this to my rotation. ![img](emote|t5_4jn9v4|49342)
I think 50 might be an understatement
Hahahahaha or maybe a Grizzbolt
    Nah, a Tocotoco
    I like the giant goofy looking dinosaurs they are just giant derps
Cant have pathing issues if theres no palbox in the first place lol
    Ah so if u disable decay, you can build anywhere?
        Yes.

You can build ANYTHING anywhere.

The Palbox is mainly a container for your pals and a designed area that they can roam in without being in your party.
            Some things can't be built like the pal condenser. Stuff that's tied to your palbox basically.
            you can't build most (or maybe all, i havent tested) things in the pal tab outside of a base
        No, if you disable decay, then the buildings that you can build everywhere dont decay anymore.
        Yeap.. Helpful if you want to cheese bosses.. Especially Frostallion. Build some walls and campfires. He walks over it and gets burn damage consistently. lol
No. They just have mods.
    Don't think any.mods spawn houses. I use mods to speed things up. This is still insane
        >Don't think any.mods spawn houses. 


No, just unlimited resources to build everything in a couple hours.
            I got enough stone and wood to do this if I so wanted and I don’t use mods my main base has over 30,000 stone and wood
                It’s not about having the resources, it’s about the added time/annoyance of transporting them around from/outside of your base. Even at my 1200 carry weight it’s a pain building anything sizable outside of my palbox zone carrying a few hundred stone at a time. And this area is huge
                    I'm 48 with almost all points in weight and no way am I doing this even with 5 wumpos
                why wood?  wood burns.  one fire pal farts and the whole place goes up.
                    The roofs in the video
                Your base Doesn't even extend that far and you would need the infinite carrying weight mod.
                    You can build outside the radius though
                        that wasn't their point. If you go outside your base you can only use up to your own weight capacity, and then you'd have to run back in to grab more.
                            Running back to grab more isn't a big deal when you can hold like 2k stone or more which will last over 10 minutes probably lol. Everything costs 3 stone. If you place down something every second it would take 11 minutes run out. You can probably place faster then 1 a second though.

If you use a potion to respec and go hard into carry capacity could probably carry 4k.

Seems only slightly harder with limited carry capacity. 10 minutes to run out and 20 seconds to back and grab 2k more.
                            If you got a fast flying mount it wouldn’t be that bad than use pals to increase max load
                                going back and forth any distance is bad. Any time you run out of materials is an interruption to what you are currently building. You have to hold f for a few seconds, fly to storage, land, grab what you need, then fly back, hold f to get off mount, then resume building. That time going back adds up a lot.
                        Sure. But they did it with infinite carrying weight and resources Plus other mods. Hence the T-pose flying.
                            The t-pose flying is from a glitch that just got patched. Basically the glitch let you equip anything in any slot. If you equipped anything but a glider in the glider slot your glide would be replaced by a t pose
                    You can also set building deterioration to zero so anything outside doesn’t go bye bye
                        Ok.  That still has absolutely nothing to do with the point I'm making. 




Cool. They built a base in a custom game with infinite resources... It doesn't take that much time when you have the resources customly jacked up to a million percent does it?
                            By that standard none of Minecraft builds are impressive because they made it in creative or with third party tools instead of mining cobblestone for months before the project even started. 

This city is impressive not because of resources or logistics, but because building system is wonky and requires lot of finese to get it allign properly like here.
                                That's not the point, nor is this Minecraft.  



>This city is impressive not because of resources or logistics, but because building system is wonky and requires lot of finese to get it allign properly like here.



No. It literally snaps to the foundation.
                            You can build quite a lot of stone structure on 250 stone and if there are stone nodes nearby even easier if you got a refined pick axe
            Even with unlimited resources and carry weight saying this took "a couple hours" is an understatement.
                No it's not.  It's not Even as cool as my Legit town with decorative interiors on normal settings.
                    Agreed.
                    Strong copium
                        Lol.  I actually have friends to build with and argue over the placement of Town hall.
                            You sound so much cooler than this guy
                                That's because I play without Mods.
            It's mods for snapping and clipping structures together. No way you get a seamless looking foundation build like this without it.

And if OP did it WITHOUT mods? Honestly even sadder.
            Even with unlimited resources and no weight concerns or anything that took way WAY more than a couple hours.
        No decay

Instant build time

Infinite resources

Flying mode.

They probably have some “creative” mod similar to minecraft too. Lol
    Or unemployment checks cashing 😂
        Some of is are playing video games while we're "working" from home. 

It's crazy because I'm doing the exact same job I was doing in the office. But my workload has gone from being slammed all day to having about 2 hours of work to get done. Then not much else to do.

It's cause the people who have chosen to stay in the office are getting the workload. Management wants to see productive workers in office so they are dumping it all on them. Meanwhile those of us at home are kicking back and playing video games on the company dime.
            That might be the case for some people, but I absolutely know people collecting unemployment to just sit around lol.
                
Some things you may not understand

- the majority of people choose not to have their unemployment taxed. Resulting in high taxes at the beginning of the year. This ended up financially devastating many families after covid.

- in the modern workforce even three or six months of empty space in your work history is enough to remove you from most application pools

- most people who live off unemployment typically suffer from much much higher rates of depression, high blood pressure and anxiety due to their financial situation. 

If the people you know living off unemployment seem like they're happy they're lying to you. Or they're lying to themselves. It just hasn't caught up with them yet. 

But once the unemployment runs out, the taxes are due and jobs refuse to hire them you will see how quickly they spiraled down. It's going to hit them hard and the longer they're on unemployment the worse it's going to be.

We recently had 2 years of millions of Americans on unemployment to back this up. Your friends are screwing themselves lol
    The resources arent the problem 😂😂

No, you can build almost anywhere, palbox just allows you to pull from chest inside the area. All he must have had to do was keep the stone and wood on his person to build
    Idk about single player, but on MP servers you would have to have the decay rate set to 0 so buildings outside the pal box zone don't eventually disappear.
        Same with single player.  

I have it set to 0 on mine so I can build bridges.

Edit: https://i.imgur.com/IBDoX1l.jpg
            Wait, how do you build bridges? Wouldn't it complain about lack of support quite fast?
                Can't do very high birdges, only ones that's like 3-4 characters tall. 

I raise the foundation as high as possible and build up from there.  Once bridge is built across I delete every other foundation to skip so you can walk under it.
                    can you do this over water
            Omg that's a great idea 💡
            Updating settings now
            Haha is that why my one wooden gate blocking the bridge leading to my base keeps disappearing? Dang.
        this is possible? I have to check it because on my private server stuff decays
        You can turn that off
    WAIT so I can make myself a proper home instead of a shitty little 2x2 shack that fits perfectly on the inside of the edge of my pal box's border?
        Yes, just make sure to edit your world settings. When things are built outside of the palbox radius, they decay. After a few in game days, the structure collapses. The materials drop to the ground.

This helps reduce lag especially in MP servers. That way, the server does not have to calculate every building the players built all the time. Once the decay timer runs out, server destroys the building and that frees up memory.
            Well that explains why the walls around my base kept disappearing. I thought it was all the raids I just ignore XD
                Yup. Found this out the hard way too. I built a tall castle with one side outside the build radius. Then one time when I logged in, I noticed that part to be missing. My pals already collected the dropped materials and stored them away.

I built it up again, thinking it's wild pals intruding (I have raids disabled). Then it happened again after a few in game days.

I only figured it out while helping a friend edit their own world settings and saw the building decay option.
            What about height of your structure? If it's within the palbox radius, is there a height where decay may start? 
                The radius is a cylinder, not a sphere, so height doesn't matter.
        Look at this rich guy with 2x2s. When I was your age entire families with their pals lived in a 1x1.
    Im wondering, if i put things outsides of the blue circle, do my pal goes there ? For example if i put a berries field, will they auto harvest for example ?
        No
        No Pokémon’s only go in the blue circle
            It's Pals but thank you, i was curious
                Pokemon. You won't change my mind.
            *Palemons
                it's just pals
                Pokepals. They're pocket pals.
Rule, everyone needs to have a relaxosorus out at all times, so seeker can get hints of hiders by their pals clipping out of houses
watch attack on titan
A palworld custom game browser would be dope
You’re living in an age where people spend thousands of hours to place millions of blocks in Minecraft, just to make basic shapes that really big.
i was thinking Mitras 😭
Now I can't unsee it
Needs to be higher
Lol, not enough soviet style apartment complexes or homeless pals.
And No problems with decay?
    You can disable decay
    thats a toggable setting, you can build as much u want outside by change decay damage to zero
    Decay can be turned off in world settings.
Can you explain the significance of this post to someone who hasn’t played Pal? What’s with all the “op is insane” “how much free time do you have” comments?
    It would take a long time to collect the materials required and then build the whole city you see him show.  Most people build a small like 4x4 hut, not a giant sprawling walled city.
    That city they're flying over - the whole thing, both neighborhoods connected by a bridge - does not exist in-game. Including the floor. They built the ENTIRE thing - the stone streets, the stairs, the walls, the gates, EVERY house.... I can't recall if the castle is a pre-existing landmark or not, but EVERYTHING else made of stone in that video was built. Which means they also had to collect all of the resources to build them. And if cement is one of those resources, then bones are an ingredient, which means they farmed the shit out of certain Pals to gather that resource.
    I have like 70hrs in this game and I can't even begin to imagine how long this took. This project must have taken several dozen hours of irl time, and that's just to build it. To make it even worse, the building system in this game is awful (early access, so it should improve). I'm actually mindblown by this with everyone else

Also, the ingredients required to do this would be another couple dozen hours. However, based on their pal they are probably at end game, maybe max level, so they probably didn't have to actively farm any ingredients to build this and just had it lying around
    This is a ridiculous and unnecessary amount of building. And way outside what you can normally fit in a base, so he obviously turned off the setting that makes buildings get automatically destroyed over time if they arent inside a safe zone that you can build a limited amount of. 

Plus, theres no real function to what he built, since you can live out of like a 1x1 little house that has a bed in it and have everything else outside in the dirt.
Know pain
Problem is lack of tools and shapes. One roof gable type, no gambled corners, no pillars or archway, no butresses or trusses. You get the idea. People have been building in MC for years and could certainly build some great stuff right out of the box in Palworld. But without the freedom of voxels, we desperately need better building tools.
    I’ve seen people get creative with roofs and stairs already to make slanted rafter looking supports in bigger buildings. We just have to learn the secret techs
Yes the palworld shall know pain
Decay is off
Scenery. Castle needs to rule over something ig
That's the thing, they didn't use any slave work here. Housing structure pieces are build instantly, no pal needed. Unless you're referring to the gathering of the materials, then yea LOL
Yes
Decay is off
Decay is off
I do
Solo
There's a setting in game/server settings for deterioration
You can build most things outside the pal box circle. Only a handful of things have to be in the circle. The catch is the server setting for base deterioration needs to be turned off or they'll decay.
2x1? Extravagant. 

I have a 1-foundation, 1-wall (with window!), 1-roof platform for my bed.
Nvm it’s all stone. So it’s doable.
It's not within a base radius. Most things can be built outside of a base radius, but you'll want to make sure your server/game settings have building deterioration turned off.
It's one of the server/game settings - Deterioration rate i believe. if 0, then no decay outside base radius
Decay is off
Yes
150 hrs, quarter of the time is game is open for my pals to gather resources
You can set the decay setting to 0 in your World Settings
    Found it, it's called "BuildObjectDeteriorationDamageRate"
Bruh if he didnt the other half of the town would decay while hes working and he would be building nonstop for the rest of his life, in a circle trying to catch up to the decay rate
Just practice and trial and error.
No mods actually
Being addicted is playing the game as much as you want. Doesn't matter what you do in game so long as you're playing it.

Let people have their fun.
> Being addicted is more about to maxing out a Pal.

That's just part of it. You can still be addicted to the game, but to other aspects versus just getting max pals and best gear.
It's a video game. It's literally all useless. 

That's why you play for fun, and not usefulness.
You can technically put all 3 bases next to each other to functionally increase the size. 

That said, all this does is turn off structure decay so you can build outside the ring. Fairly certain the actual base ring can’t be increased and your pals will not use stations or path outside that ring; same goes for your base resources. It’s purely decorative so I don’t see how it’s cheating. I guess you can say he spawned in or bumped up numbers to get infinite resources, but I’d be shocked if the game doesn’t have a “creative mode” at some point anyway. Even with all the resources in the world it takes time and effort to make a build that looks good, especially with a building system as archaic and limited as this game.
It ain't cheap it's just made by a smaller team of developers. They went into mad debt tryna make a fun game. Looks like it paid off because it is fun.
    I need to give it another try. Idk what it is
        [deleted]
Need custom difficulty to turn off building degradation outside of a base or you'll have no where near enough space to build....
Nah those walls are just 3 stone a piece. A farm or two running 24/7 would get you enough stone in like a day, maybe two or three idk I didn't count, if you design it well and your pals don't path themselves to an early grave. I left mine running overnight and came back ~14 hours later to 9999 stone.
    ~~3~~ 10 stone + 1 cement.



That's a lot of bones. 👀
        How else do you build the empire?
        Stone walls are just 3 stone no cement tho. 

Are we talking defensive stone walls? I thought we were talking about the walls and foundations to make all the buildings if not my bad. 
            Oops, my bad, I thought we were talking about defensive walls (which are 10 stone + 1 cement.) 
^Corrected ^my ^original ^comment.



You are correct, those are only 3 stone. Which, there's A LOT here! 


This build really *rocks*... I'll see myself out...
                To be fair to you though there still are a TON of defensive walls in that bitch!
                You should be stoned for that one
        Easier to just buy bones from the merchant NPC.
I love this game but my god there are such better games for building. Building in this game feels really unfinished. I can't imagine spending this much time wrestling with the build system.
    It's been out for a month on early access. Ark was janky too. Just give it time. Building is easy when you know how the broken system works lol
        “That slanted wall doesn’t fit here. Maybe if I remove this wall and these stairs…. Oh, Oops. I guess we’re living in a bungalow now.”
            I had problems with slanted roofs, but if you put a piece down like making a ramp up to the where you need it, it clicks in. Then just delete what you don't want
                I think the slanted roofs are intended to be placed on top of the flat roof. It's the only way the snap point makes sense to me.
                    As someone who builds roofs. Yes, the slanted pieces go on top of the flat part.
                        As someone who roofs, the flat part that the slanted part goes on is in fact— also slanted.
                            That’s just semantics. Everything is slanted in one way of another.
                            As someone who roofies, a slan...where are you guys going?
                    For an early access with the potential of tons of expansion, and patches - it’s pretty damn good.  It’s an amazing foundation that could have a ton of possibilities.
            Multi-level stairs have been my major building annoyance. It seems like they just don't want to snap to the roof unless I'm standing at just the right angle
        Hasn’t it only been 2 weeks?
            Yes
        Honestly, Ark is jankier than this even after years. Still love it, though.
        I mean building in ark is still ass also.
            It is, but it got better. Hopefully this one improves
                Agreed it DID improve.
I’m hoping for more of a Conan level glow up on the building to be honest.

I understand that this is basically ARK were your dinosaurs can work.
But that’s kind of my issue right now.
They should be shooting for Conan with animals…. And less boobs.
                    Eh I think the gameplay to boob ratio is fine tbh
            Ascended really fixed up the building. I enjoy it a lot more now.
        I've been playing ark since the Xbox early access, the early early stages were so fucked sometimes. Couldn't place foundation because of terrain but it's on a flat surface.

Dinos wandering off never to return.

Accidentally using the wrong whistle and now all your dinos are a mile away.

Atleast pals stay in the base lol
            My biggest wish, is flying pals to land. I really wanna see my birbs hop around.
        Ark was janky until a mod came out that did it better then they just added it to the base game.
        Omg it was made by the guys who made ARK!?!? No wonder I had this familiar but unsettling feeling.
    It’s almost like it’s an early access game lmfao
    Give it some time, it barely hatched.
    It’s almost like this game has only been out a few weeks on early access
But then I spent so many nights, thinking how it did me wrong...
    And I grew my pals strong and learned how to ride along..
        Now I'm back, from an hour's sleep;

Just spawned in to find my Pals are all sick and weak;
            I should have never logged out 


I should have never went to sleep
                If I had know for just one second how long that it would take..  
to make those meds! those fucking meds!.
                    Don't lay around town, I just built you 15 beds!
                        and I got all these spheres to give and built a farm to raise your kids
                            I think I have the strongest foxparks, but then I meet Mammorest and he only barks
                        Go on now, go! Walk through the floor!

Just stand around now. 'Cause you're not working anymore.

        Your goal was to abuse an exploit that isn't going to be there on the full release? Weird flex but okay.
It incorporates a lot of different game elements that are not just Pokemon. As far as new games go it is an incredible value at $30.
    well, it's not really new either.  it's ark+ pokemon mainly, with a few elements from breath of the wild.  i dont think they're doing anything new other than combining already understood concepts.

that being said, it's definitely fun.  however if you've already extensively played ark then there you'll find much of the game to be almost the same.  i haven't so it seems fresher than it is to me.

agree it's pretty good value for $30 but you do end up having to work around many of the faults in the game too.  if this were a triple a studio it would be viewed much differently.
        If it were a AAA studio it'd be worse and there wouldn't have been any patches to address issues for three months, and they'd be selling us pals with good passives via microtransaction... or just have us random draw them.
            eh, this is definitely far buggier than my expectations and is riddled with obvious issues, such as a pretty stale gameplay loop and copy paste elements from other games.  this game can easily be monetized more so maybe that's the main difference you're seeing.

im only talking to talk.  it's the right use of the early access tag and the devs seem to be reasonable people atm.  everyone likes to support what they see as a good thing but let's be honest, gamers make bad decisions with their money and this can easily become another in a long line of games that did the exact same thing.
        Okay. But it is still a new game. Incorporating other games’ concepts doesn’t make it not a new game lol.
            As a percentage, how much of the game would you say is new?  And what are those new concepts?
                It’s arguing a moot point. Who cares. It is a new game that incorporates pieces of other games into it to create something fun. There’s no point arguing semantics of newness. It is a new game for $30 with known concepts.
                    this is a discussion.  but if you aren't able to answer the question then we do not have to continue
It's worth every penny imo. I'm a big fan of Minecraft, Pokemon, and a myriad of RPGs and this scratches all those sweet spots. Obviously it's buggy since it's still pre-release, but tbh I've seen "finished" games with more bugs. The headaches don't come anywhere near superseding the experience overall. I wasn't even planning on touching this game because same with money issues but I saw ibxtoycat trying it out and it just seemed so much more engaging and rich than I would've ever expected.

Edit: I have it on PC, from what I see console could have different issues for you to overcome so I can't speak to that experience. Just to be clear.
    Let’s be clear, about 30 hours into my world or so my entire save just disappeared gone bye bye. I’d still say this is the best 30$$ I’ve ever spent. (Hours down the rabbit hole lead to finding a way to get your save back.)
    > but tbh I've seen "finished" games with more bugs

Cyberpunk 2077 comes to mind for me. But CD Projekt Red did the right thing and fixed the myriad of issues. It's a great game now. Well, It was great at launch too if you just looked past the glitchyness.
If your budget is tight, it might be worth waiting a bit until you feel better about buying it. They put out a patch yesterday that helped a bunch with the AI, but it still needs plenty of work and there's little things that can get super frustrating with base management. So far, every patch they're putting out is getting all of that in order and they've been doing a good job with it.  


I have 60+ hours in the damn game already. If you enjoy survival crafters, and you like team building RPG elements, then you'll absolutely love this game. It really is a blast, but please don't stretch yourself to pick it up if it doesn't make sense. The game will always be here, and as time goes on they'll have more and more of the jank patched up.
So I backed this game when it was still a Kickstarter. I'm saying this so you understand I'm not just on a bandwagon, I've been excited for this game for a while.


Let me preface what I'm about to say with if you don't like survival games you're not going to like this game. If you like survival games, you'll like this. If you like building games you'll like this and it'll only get better over time. If you like creature taming games you like this. And if you like Pokemon you'll probably like this too. Honestly I really hate the Pokemon with guns comparison, but in some ways this is the Pokemon game we've always wanted Nintendo to make.


Now I have sank over 200 hours since the release of the game about 2 weeks ago. In those 200 hours I can safely say that for $30 this is probably one of the greatest values of the game you can get. I say this because this is just the beginning, there's a whole island that we can see that isn't in the game yet that will be, there's nowhere to go but up for this game. There are some weird buggy AI issues, which is par for the course for any game where you have creatures in your base; I.E. Ark. But every patch has had a ton of fixes, and the game's been out for 2 weeks and they've already patched it three times. This goes to show that they do care about the project they are working on it actively, which means a $30 investment for a game that will probably increase in price later down the road 100% worth.
The hype train isn't there just because it's pokemon, the hype train is there because they done the pokemon formula way better than official pokemon games

Also, just because a lot of people love the game doesn't mean you will, seeing as reddit commenters don't know you personally they can't recommend something based off your interests. Watch some reviews and gameplay on YouTube. If that's not enough to make your mind up, a random person on reddit telling you whether to buy it or not won't change that 😂
It's really good. (Never played/watched Pokémon, alwaus found it stupid. Soo...this is way better than that shit game. (~~You even get to kidnap humans~~)!
Do you have friends to play with? Get it. Do you not? Don't get it.

That's my 2c. It's a very fun game, but it's one of those games where you really need friends to truly enjoy.

Obviously please don't someone come at me with "I enjoy playing games solo" that's your prerogative my advice doesn't apply. The game's just better with friends.
    While i see the sentiment here, this might be the best crafting-survival game to play solo, since most of them feel very lonely but here you get your pals running around.
If Ark and Rust are any indication, this is one of those games that will have active players and support for years to come.
> Is it worth getting? 

No, it got bugs, enemies wont attack sometimes and theres lack of soul on it ~thats for me~  you can expend that money on something better for real.

Edit: you can try it out on steam and if you dont like it ask for a refund "remember you have to request before the 2 hours mark" or just play it on gamepass thats what i did.
It's either this or crafting benches in every other house
    I was gonna say if there isn't a crafting bench inside each house then they're just empty and the builds trash anyways lol
        They really should have been fully furnished before moving on IMO


unrelated note I have plans for when I no longer have anything else to do in game 😂
            I’m a builder and my long term game partner is a decorator. She can handle all the pretty plants and comfy beds, I’m gonna sit here swearing at the roofs and missing my sons of the forest system
Smart choice. The best subs have their own emojis. ![img](emote|t5_4jn9v4|49342)
I've been saying this every time I see one, it's a problem, my base is next to a Fuack'ing Fuack spawn ![img](emote|t5_4jn9v4|49350)
    me too lmao
    That bad huh? First time in a raid a certain incineram burns my wooden house down
        Luckily I only build out of rock and stone, not leaf and log like some kinda pointy eared leaf lovers.

Also, it's a blessing. I never need pal fluids, I just grab some from my Fuack'ing garden ![img](emote|t5_4jn9v4|49350)
            For Rock and Stone!
                For Carl
                    ROCK AND STONE TO THE BONE
                        If you don’t rock and stone, you ain’t coming home
                    Rock and Stone To The Bone
                    This comment has no where near enough up votes lol
            I am pissed that I chose to disassemble my base… nothing followed… have had to start over again because I chose the new place beside a beach… but good thing is, I finally caught grizzbolt and found a massand lux… though the not so good thing is I haven’t researched the saddle for the grizzlebolt. Welll I guess I will settle for the grenade launcher
                Grizzbolt harness comes decently later into the game lol, it's a long grind on default settings lol

I've relocated 3 times, and each time they've been better bases.

But until they get the base AI running properly, the best bases are as flat as possible, and as low as possible lol
                    Yeah I noticed that last night when my chubby electric mouse was hovering above my building making arrows for me and glitches all over the place like Freakazoid. Threw that yellow motherFuacker a million times before he stopped acting the micky.
                        A reset can help that if yeeting them at the job keeps saying "automatic work mode"

It sucks, but given the game is early, I'm happy to let them cook.
                        Hehehehe I am somewhat confused though it says grenade launcher in the description soooo why am I seeing rocket launchers when that skill activated? 😅
            never build with wood.  wood burns.
        Lmfao my first base and main base for a min is at a spot that isnt easy for the Pals to invade. Idk why, they just need to jump down lol only problem i had was when Pal "Freedom" fighters popped up. They dont play lol
Nah, a Tocotoco
I like the giant goofy looking dinosaurs they are just giant derps
Ah so if u disable decay, you can build anywhere?
    Yes.

You can build ANYTHING anywhere.

The Palbox is mainly a container for your pals and a designed area that they can roam in without being in your party.
        Some things can't be built like the pal condenser. Stuff that's tied to your palbox basically.
        you can't build most (or maybe all, i havent tested) things in the pal tab outside of a base
    No, if you disable decay, then the buildings that you can build everywhere dont decay anymore.
    Yeap.. Helpful if you want to cheese bosses.. Especially Frostallion. Build some walls and campfires. He walks over it and gets burn damage consistently. lol
Don't think any.mods spawn houses. I use mods to speed things up. This is still insane
    >Don't think any.mods spawn houses. 


No, just unlimited resources to build everything in a couple hours.
        I got enough stone and wood to do this if I so wanted and I don’t use mods my main base has over 30,000 stone and wood
            It’s not about having the resources, it’s about the added time/annoyance of transporting them around from/outside of your base. Even at my 1200 carry weight it’s a pain building anything sizable outside of my palbox zone carrying a few hundred stone at a time. And this area is huge
                I'm 48 with almost all points in weight and no way am I doing this even with 5 wumpos
            why wood?  wood burns.  one fire pal farts and the whole place goes up.
                The roofs in the video
            Your base Doesn't even extend that far and you would need the infinite carrying weight mod.
                You can build outside the radius though
                    that wasn't their point. If you go outside your base you can only use up to your own weight capacity, and then you'd have to run back in to grab more.
                        Running back to grab more isn't a big deal when you can hold like 2k stone or more which will last over 10 minutes probably lol. Everything costs 3 stone. If you place down something every second it would take 11 minutes run out. You can probably place faster then 1 a second though.

If you use a potion to respec and go hard into carry capacity could probably carry 4k.

Seems only slightly harder with limited carry capacity. 10 minutes to run out and 20 seconds to back and grab 2k more.
                        If you got a fast flying mount it wouldn’t be that bad than use pals to increase max load
                            going back and forth any distance is bad. Any time you run out of materials is an interruption to what you are currently building. You have to hold f for a few seconds, fly to storage, land, grab what you need, then fly back, hold f to get off mount, then resume building. That time going back adds up a lot.
                    Sure. But they did it with infinite carrying weight and resources Plus other mods. Hence the T-pose flying.
                        The t-pose flying is from a glitch that just got patched. Basically the glitch let you equip anything in any slot. If you equipped anything but a glider in the glider slot your glide would be replaced by a t pose
                You can also set building deterioration to zero so anything outside doesn’t go bye bye
                    Ok.  That still has absolutely nothing to do with the point I'm making. 




Cool. They built a base in a custom game with infinite resources... It doesn't take that much time when you have the resources customly jacked up to a million percent does it?
                        By that standard none of Minecraft builds are impressive because they made it in creative or with third party tools instead of mining cobblestone for months before the project even started. 

This city is impressive not because of resources or logistics, but because building system is wonky and requires lot of finese to get it allign properly like here.
                            That's not the point, nor is this Minecraft.  



>This city is impressive not because of resources or logistics, but because building system is wonky and requires lot of finese to get it allign properly like here.



No. It literally snaps to the foundation.
                        You can build quite a lot of stone structure on 250 stone and if there are stone nodes nearby even easier if you got a refined pick axe
        Even with unlimited resources and carry weight saying this took "a couple hours" is an understatement.
            No it's not.  It's not Even as cool as my Legit town with decorative interiors on normal settings.
                Agreed.
                Strong copium
                    Lol.  I actually have friends to build with and argue over the placement of Town hall.
                        You sound so much cooler than this guy
                            That's because I play without Mods.
        It's mods for snapping and clipping structures together. No way you get a seamless looking foundation build like this without it.

And if OP did it WITHOUT mods? Honestly even sadder.
        Even with unlimited resources and no weight concerns or anything that took way WAY more than a couple hours.
    No decay

Instant build time

Infinite resources

Flying mode.

They probably have some “creative” mod similar to minecraft too. Lol
Or unemployment checks cashing 😂
    Some of is are playing video games while we're "working" from home. 

It's crazy because I'm doing the exact same job I was doing in the office. But my workload has gone from being slammed all day to having about 2 hours of work to get done. Then not much else to do.

It's cause the people who have chosen to stay in the office are getting the workload. Management wants to see productive workers in office so they are dumping it all on them. Meanwhile those of us at home are kicking back and playing video games on the company dime.
        That might be the case for some people, but I absolutely know people collecting unemployment to just sit around lol.
            
Some things you may not understand

- the majority of people choose not to have their unemployment taxed. Resulting in high taxes at the beginning of the year. This ended up financially devastating many families after covid.

- in the modern workforce even three or six months of empty space in your work history is enough to remove you from most application pools

- most people who live off unemployment typically suffer from much much higher rates of depression, high blood pressure and anxiety due to their financial situation. 

If the people you know living off unemployment seem like they're happy they're lying to you. Or they're lying to themselves. It just hasn't caught up with them yet. 

But once the unemployment runs out, the taxes are due and jobs refuse to hire them you will see how quickly they spiraled down. It's going to hit them hard and the longer they're on unemployment the worse it's going to be.

We recently had 2 years of millions of Americans on unemployment to back this up. Your friends are screwing themselves lol

Idk about single player, but on MP servers you would have to have the decay rate set to 0 so buildings outside the pal box zone don't eventually disappear.
    Same with single player.  

I have it set to 0 on mine so I can build bridges.

Edit: https://i.imgur.com/IBDoX1l.jpg
        Wait, how do you build bridges? Wouldn't it complain about lack of support quite fast?
            Can't do very high birdges, only ones that's like 3-4 characters tall. 

I raise the foundation as high as possible and build up from there.  Once bridge is built across I delete every other foundation to skip so you can walk under it.
                can you do this over water
        Omg that's a great idea 💡
        Updating settings now
        Haha is that why my one wooden gate blocking the bridge leading to my base keeps disappearing? Dang.
    this is possible? I have to check it because on my private server stuff decays
    You can turn that off
WAIT so I can make myself a proper home instead of a shitty little 2x2 shack that fits perfectly on the inside of the edge of my pal box's border?
    Yes, just make sure to edit your world settings. When things are built outside of the palbox radius, they decay. After a few in game days, the structure collapses. The materials drop to the ground.

This helps reduce lag especially in MP servers. That way, the server does not have to calculate every building the players built all the time. Once the decay timer runs out, server destroys the building and that frees up memory.
        Well that explains why the walls around my base kept disappearing. I thought it was all the raids I just ignore XD
            Yup. Found this out the hard way too. I built a tall castle with one side outside the build radius. Then one time when I logged in, I noticed that part to be missing. My pals already collected the dropped materials and stored them away.

I built it up again, thinking it's wild pals intruding (I have raids disabled). Then it happened again after a few in game days.

I only figured it out while helping a friend edit their own world settings and saw the building decay option.
        What about height of your structure? If it's within the palbox radius, is there a height where decay may start? 
            The radius is a cylinder, not a sphere, so height doesn't matter.
    Look at this rich guy with 2x2s. When I was your age entire families with their pals lived in a 1x1.
Im wondering, if i put things outsides of the blue circle, do my pal goes there ? For example if i put a berries field, will they auto harvest for example ?
    No
    No Pokémon’s only go in the blue circle
        It's Pals but thank you, i was curious
            Pokemon. You won't change my mind.
        *Palemons
            it's just pals
            Pokepals. They're pocket pals.
You can disable decay
thats a toggable setting, you can build as much u want outside by change decay damage to zero
Decay can be turned off in world settings.
It would take a long time to collect the materials required and then build the whole city you see him show.  Most people build a small like 4x4 hut, not a giant sprawling walled city.
That city they're flying over - the whole thing, both neighborhoods connected by a bridge - does not exist in-game. Including the floor. They built the ENTIRE thing - the stone streets, the stairs, the walls, the gates, EVERY house.... I can't recall if the castle is a pre-existing landmark or not, but EVERYTHING else made of stone in that video was built. Which means they also had to collect all of the resources to build them. And if cement is one of those resources, then bones are an ingredient, which means they farmed the shit out of certain Pals to gather that resource.
I have like 70hrs in this game and I can't even begin to imagine how long this took. This project must have taken several dozen hours of irl time, and that's just to build it. To make it even worse, the building system in this game is awful (early access, so it should improve). I'm actually mindblown by this with everyone else

Also, the ingredients required to do this would be another couple dozen hours. However, based on their pal they are probably at end game, maybe max level, so they probably didn't have to actively farm any ingredients to build this and just had it lying around
This is a ridiculous and unnecessary amount of building. And way outside what you can normally fit in a base, so he obviously turned off the setting that makes buildings get automatically destroyed over time if they arent inside a safe zone that you can build a limited amount of. 

Plus, theres no real function to what he built, since you can live out of like a 1x1 little house that has a bed in it and have everything else outside in the dirt.
I’ve seen people get creative with roofs and stairs already to make slanted rafter looking supports in bigger buildings. We just have to learn the secret techs
Found it, it's called "BuildObjectDeteriorationDamageRate"
I need to give it another try. Idk what it is
    [deleted]
~~3~~ 10 stone + 1 cement.



That's a lot of bones. 👀
    How else do you build the empire?
    Stone walls are just 3 stone no cement tho. 

Are we talking defensive stone walls? I thought we were talking about the walls and foundations to make all the buildings if not my bad. 
        Oops, my bad, I thought we were talking about defensive walls (which are 10 stone + 1 cement.) 
^Corrected ^my ^original ^comment.



You are correct, those are only 3 stone. Which, there's A LOT here! 


This build really *rocks*... I'll see myself out...
            To be fair to you though there still are a TON of defensive walls in that bitch!
            You should be stoned for that one
    Easier to just buy bones from the merchant NPC.
It's been out for a month on early access. Ark was janky too. Just give it time. Building is easy when you know how the broken system works lol
    “That slanted wall doesn’t fit here. Maybe if I remove this wall and these stairs…. Oh, Oops. I guess we’re living in a bungalow now.”
        I had problems with slanted roofs, but if you put a piece down like making a ramp up to the where you need it, it clicks in. Then just delete what you don't want
            I think the slanted roofs are intended to be placed on top of the flat roof. It's the only way the snap point makes sense to me.
                As someone who builds roofs. Yes, the slanted pieces go on top of the flat part.
                    As someone who roofs, the flat part that the slanted part goes on is in fact— also slanted.
                        That’s just semantics. Everything is slanted in one way of another.
                        As someone who roofies, a slan...where are you guys going?
                For an early access with the potential of tons of expansion, and patches - it’s pretty damn good.  It’s an amazing foundation that could have a ton of possibilities.
        Multi-level stairs have been my major building annoyance. It seems like they just don't want to snap to the roof unless I'm standing at just the right angle
    Hasn’t it only been 2 weeks?
        Yes
    Honestly, Ark is jankier than this even after years. Still love it, though.
    I mean building in ark is still ass also.
        It is, but it got better. Hopefully this one improves
            Agreed it DID improve.
I’m hoping for more of a Conan level glow up on the building to be honest.

I understand that this is basically ARK were your dinosaurs can work.
But that’s kind of my issue right now.
They should be shooting for Conan with animals…. And less boobs.
                Eh I think the gameplay to boob ratio is fine tbh
        Ascended really fixed up the building. I enjoy it a lot more now.
    I've been playing ark since the Xbox early access, the early early stages were so fucked sometimes. Couldn't place foundation because of terrain but it's on a flat surface.

Dinos wandering off never to return.

Accidentally using the wrong whistle and now all your dinos are a mile away.

Atleast pals stay in the base lol
        My biggest wish, is flying pals to land. I really wanna see my birbs hop around.
    Ark was janky until a mod came out that did it better then they just added it to the base game.
    Omg it was made by the guys who made ARK!?!? No wonder I had this familiar but unsettling feeling.
It’s almost like it’s an early access game lmfao
Give it some time, it barely hatched.
It’s almost like this game has only been out a few weeks on early access
And I grew my pals strong and learned how to ride along..
    Now I'm back, from an hour's sleep;

Just spawned in to find my Pals are all sick and weak;
        I should have never logged out 


I should have never went to sleep
            If I had know for just one second how long that it would take..  
to make those meds! those fucking meds!.
                Don't lay around town, I just built you 15 beds!
                    and I got all these spheres to give and built a farm to raise your kids
                        I think I have the strongest foxparks, but then I meet Mammorest and he only barks
                    Go on now, go! Walk through the floor!

Just stand around now. 'Cause you're not working anymore.

    Your goal was to abuse an exploit that isn't going to be there on the full release? Weird flex but okay.
well, it's not really new either.  it's ark+ pokemon mainly, with a few elements from breath of the wild.  i dont think they're doing anything new other than combining already understood concepts.

that being said, it's definitely fun.  however if you've already extensively played ark then there you'll find much of the game to be almost the same.  i haven't so it seems fresher than it is to me.

agree it's pretty good value for $30 but you do end up having to work around many of the faults in the game too.  if this were a triple a studio it would be viewed much differently.
    If it were a AAA studio it'd be worse and there wouldn't have been any patches to address issues for three months, and they'd be selling us pals with good passives via microtransaction... or just have us random draw them.
        eh, this is definitely far buggier than my expectations and is riddled with obvious issues, such as a pretty stale gameplay loop and copy paste elements from other games.  this game can easily be monetized more so maybe that's the main difference you're seeing.

im only talking to talk.  it's the right use of the early access tag and the devs seem to be reasonable people atm.  everyone likes to support what they see as a good thing but let's be honest, gamers make bad decisions with their money and this can easily become another in a long line of games that did the exact same thing.
    Okay. But it is still a new game. Incorporating other games’ concepts doesn’t make it not a new game lol.
        As a percentage, how much of the game would you say is new?  And what are those new concepts?
            It’s arguing a moot point. Who cares. It is a new game that incorporates pieces of other games into it to create something fun. There’s no point arguing semantics of newness. It is a new game for $30 with known concepts.
                this is a discussion.  but if you aren't able to answer the question then we do not have to continue
Let’s be clear, about 30 hours into my world or so my entire save just disappeared gone bye bye. I’d still say this is the best 30$$ I’ve ever spent. (Hours down the rabbit hole lead to finding a way to get your save back.)
> but tbh I've seen "finished" games with more bugs

Cyberpunk 2077 comes to mind for me. But CD Projekt Red did the right thing and fixed the myriad of issues. It's a great game now. Well, It was great at launch too if you just looked past the glitchyness.
While i see the sentiment here, this might be the best crafting-survival game to play solo, since most of them feel very lonely but here you get your pals running around.
I was gonna say if there isn't a crafting bench inside each house then they're just empty and the builds trash anyways lol
    They really should have been fully furnished before moving on IMO


unrelated note I have plans for when I no longer have anything else to do in game 😂
        I’m a builder and my long term game partner is a decorator. She can handle all the pretty plants and comfy beds, I’m gonna sit here swearing at the roofs and missing my sons of the forest system
me too lmao
That bad huh? First time in a raid a certain incineram burns my wooden house down
    Luckily I only build out of rock and stone, not leaf and log like some kinda pointy eared leaf lovers.

Also, it's a blessing. I never need pal fluids, I just grab some from my Fuack'ing garden ![img](emote|t5_4jn9v4|49350)
        For Rock and Stone!
            For Carl

                This comment has no where near enough up votes lol
        I am pissed that I chose to disassemble my base… nothing followed… have had to start over again because I chose the new place beside a beach… but good thing is, I finally caught grizzbolt and found a massand lux… though the not so good thing is I haven’t researched the saddle for the grizzlebolt. Welll I guess I will settle for the grenade launcher
            Grizzbolt harness comes decently later into the game lol, it's a long grind on default settings lol

I've relocated 3 times, and each time they've been better bases.

But until they get the base AI running properly, the best bases are as flat as possible, and as low as possible lol
                Yeah I noticed that last night when my chubby electric mouse was hovering above my building making arrows for me and glitches all over the place like Freakazoid. Threw that yellow motherFuacker a million times before he stopped acting the micky.
                    A reset can help that if yeeting them at the job keeps saying "automatic work mode"

It sucks, but given the game is early, I'm happy to let them cook.
                    Hehehehe I am somewhat confused though it says grenade launcher in the description soooo why am I seeing rocket launchers when that skill activated? 😅
        never build with wood.  wood burns.
    Lmfao my first base and main base for a min is at a spot that isnt easy for the Pals to invade. Idk why, they just need to jump down lol only problem i had was when Pal "Freedom" fighters popped up. They dont play lol
Yes.

You can build ANYTHING anywhere.

The Palbox is mainly a container for your pals and a designed area that they can roam in without being in your party.
    Some things can't be built like the pal condenser. Stuff that's tied to your palbox basically.
    you can't build most (or maybe all, i havent tested) things in the pal tab outside of a base
No, if you disable decay, then the buildings that you can build everywhere dont decay anymore.
Yeap.. Helpful if you want to cheese bosses.. Especially Frostallion. Build some walls and campfires. He walks over it and gets burn damage consistently. lol
>Don't think any.mods spawn houses. 


No, just unlimited resources to build everything in a couple hours.
    I got enough stone and wood to do this if I so wanted and I don’t use mods my main base has over 30,000 stone and wood
        It’s not about having the resources, it’s about the added time/annoyance of transporting them around from/outside of your base. Even at my 1200 carry weight it’s a pain building anything sizable outside of my palbox zone carrying a few hundred stone at a time. And this area is huge
            I'm 48 with almost all points in weight and no way am I doing this even with 5 wumpos
        why wood?  wood burns.  one fire pal farts and the whole place goes up.
            The roofs in the video
        Your base Doesn't even extend that far and you would need the infinite carrying weight mod.
            You can build outside the radius though
                that wasn't their point. If you go outside your base you can only use up to your own weight capacity, and then you'd have to run back in to grab more.
                    Running back to grab more isn't a big deal when you can hold like 2k stone or more which will last over 10 minutes probably lol. Everything costs 3 stone. If you place down something every second it would take 11 minutes run out. You can probably place faster then 1 a second though.

If you use a potion to respec and go hard into carry capacity could probably carry 4k.

Seems only slightly harder with limited carry capacity. 10 minutes to run out and 20 seconds to back and grab 2k more.
                    If you got a fast flying mount it wouldn’t be that bad than use pals to increase max load
                        going back and forth any distance is bad. Any time you run out of materials is an interruption to what you are currently building. You have to hold f for a few seconds, fly to storage, land, grab what you need, then fly back, hold f to get off mount, then resume building. That time going back adds up a lot.
                Sure. But they did it with infinite carrying weight and resources Plus other mods. Hence the T-pose flying.
                    The t-pose flying is from a glitch that just got patched. Basically the glitch let you equip anything in any slot. If you equipped anything but a glider in the glider slot your glide would be replaced by a t pose
            You can also set building deterioration to zero so anything outside doesn’t go bye bye
                Ok.  That still has absolutely nothing to do with the point I'm making. 




Cool. They built a base in a custom game with infinite resources... It doesn't take that much time when you have the resources customly jacked up to a million percent does it?
                    By that standard none of Minecraft builds are impressive because they made it in creative or with third party tools instead of mining cobblestone for months before the project even started. 

This city is impressive not because of resources or logistics, but because building system is wonky and requires lot of finese to get it allign properly like here.

No. It literally snaps to the foundation.
                    You can build quite a lot of stone structure on 250 stone and if there are stone nodes nearby even easier if you got a refined pick axe

^Corrected ^my ^original ^comment.



You are correct, those are only 3 stone. Which, there's A LOT here! 


This build really *rocks*... I'll see myself out...
        To be fair to you though there still are a TON of defensive walls in that bitch!
        You should be stoned for that one
Easier to just buy bones from the merchant NPC.
“That slanted wall doesn’t fit here. Maybe if I remove this wall and these stairs…. Oh, Oops. I guess we’re living in a bungalow now.”
    I had problems with slanted roofs, but if you put a piece down like making a ramp up to the where you need it, it clicks in. Then just delete what you don't want
        I think the slanted roofs are intended to be placed on top of the flat roof. It's the only way the snap point makes sense to me.
            As someone who builds roofs. Yes, the slanted pieces go on top of the flat part.
                As someone who roofs, the flat part that the slanted part goes on is in fact— also slanted.
                    That’s just semantics. Everything is slanted in one way of another.
                    As someone who roofies, a slan...where are you guys going?
            For an early access with the potential of tons of expansion, and patches - it’s pretty damn good.  It’s an amazing foundation that could have a ton of possibilities.
    Multi-level stairs have been my major building annoyance. It seems like they just don't want to snap to the roof unless I'm standing at just the right angle
Hasn’t it only been 2 weeks?
    Yes
Honestly, Ark is jankier than this even after years. Still love it, though.
I mean building in ark is still ass also.
    It is, but it got better. Hopefully this one improves
        Agreed it DID improve.
I’m hoping for more of a Conan level glow up on the building to be honest.

I understand that this is basically ARK were your dinosaurs can work.
But that’s kind of my issue right now.
They should be shooting for Conan with animals…. And less boobs.
            Eh I think the gameplay to boob ratio is fine tbh
    Ascended really fixed up the building. I enjoy it a lot more now.
I've been playing ark since the Xbox early access, the early early stages were so fucked sometimes. Couldn't place foundation because of terrain but it's on a flat surface.

Dinos wandering off never to return.

Accidentally using the wrong whistle and now all your dinos are a mile away.

Atleast pals stay in the base lol
    My biggest wish, is flying pals to land. I really wanna see my birbs hop around.
Ark was janky until a mod came out that did it better then they just added it to the base game.
Omg it was made by the guys who made ARK!?!? No wonder I had this familiar but unsettling feeling.
Now I'm back, from an hour's sleep;

Just spawned in to find my Pals are all sick and weak;
    I should have never logged out 


I should have never went to sleep
        If I had know for just one second how long that it would take..  
to make those meds! those fucking meds!.
            Don't lay around town, I just built you 15 beds!
                and I got all these spheres to give and built a farm to raise your kids
                    I think I have the strongest foxparks, but then I meet Mammorest and he only barks
                Go on now, go! Walk through the floor!

Just stand around now. 'Cause you're not working anymore.
Your goal was to abuse an exploit that isn't going to be there on the full release? Weird flex but okay.
If it were a AAA studio it'd be worse and there wouldn't have been any patches to address issues for three months, and they'd be selling us pals with good passives via microtransaction... or just have us random draw them.
    eh, this is definitely far buggier than my expectations and is riddled with obvious issues, such as a pretty stale gameplay loop and copy paste elements from other games.  this game can easily be monetized more so maybe that's the main difference you're seeing.

im only talking to talk.  it's the right use of the early access tag and the devs seem to be reasonable people atm.  everyone likes to support what they see as a good thing but let's be honest, gamers make bad decisions with their money and this can easily become another in a long line of games that did the exact same thing.
Okay. But it is still a new game. Incorporating other games’ concepts doesn’t make it not a new game lol.
    As a percentage, how much of the game would you say is new?  And what are those new concepts?
        It’s arguing a moot point. Who cares. It is a new game that incorporates pieces of other games into it to create something fun. There’s no point arguing semantics of newness. It is a new game for $30 with known concepts.
            this is a discussion.  but if you aren't able to answer the question then we do not have to continue
They really should have been fully furnished before moving on IMO


unrelated note I have plans for when I no longer have anything else to do in game 😂
    I’m a builder and my long term game partner is a decorator. She can handle all the pretty plants and comfy beds, I’m gonna sit here swearing at the roofs and missing my sons of the forest system
Luckily I only build out of rock and stone, not leaf and log like some kinda pointy eared leaf lovers.

Also, it's a blessing. I never need pal fluids, I just grab some from my Fuack'ing garden ![img](emote|t5_4jn9v4|49350)

            This comment has no where near enough up votes lol
    I am pissed that I chose to disassemble my base… nothing followed… have had to start over again because I chose the new place beside a beach… but good thing is, I finally caught grizzbolt and found a massand lux… though the not so good thing is I haven’t researched the saddle for the grizzlebolt. Welll I guess I will settle for the grenade launcher
        Grizzbolt harness comes decently later into the game lol, it's a long grind on default settings lol

I've relocated 3 times, and each time they've been better bases.

But until they get the base AI running properly, the best bases are as flat as possible, and as low as possible lol
            Yeah I noticed that last night when my chubby electric mouse was hovering above my building making arrows for me and glitches all over the place like Freakazoid. Threw that yellow motherFuacker a million times before he stopped acting the micky.
                A reset can help that if yeeting them at the job keeps saying "automatic work mode"

It sucks, but given the game is early, I'm happy to let them cook.
                Hehehehe I am somewhat confused though it says grenade launcher in the description soooo why am I seeing rocket launchers when that skill activated? 😅
    never build with wood.  wood burns.
Lmfao my first base and main base for a min is at a spot that isnt easy for the Pals to invade. Idk why, they just need to jump down lol only problem i had was when Pal "Freedom" fighters popped up. They dont play lol
Some things can't be built like the pal condenser. Stuff that's tied to your palbox basically.
you can't build most (or maybe all, i havent tested) things in the pal tab outside of a base
I got enough stone and wood to do this if I so wanted and I don’t use mods my main base has over 30,000 stone and wood
    It’s not about having the resources, it’s about the added time/annoyance of transporting them around from/outside of your base. Even at my 1200 carry weight it’s a pain building anything sizable outside of my palbox zone carrying a few hundred stone at a time. And this area is huge
        I'm 48 with almost all points in weight and no way am I doing this even with 5 wumpos
    why wood?  wood burns.  one fire pal farts and the whole place goes up.
        The roofs in the video
    Your base Doesn't even extend that far and you would need the infinite carrying weight mod.
        You can build outside the radius though
            that wasn't their point. If you go outside your base you can only use up to your own weight capacity, and then you'd have to run back in to grab more.
                Running back to grab more isn't a big deal when you can hold like 2k stone or more which will last over 10 minutes probably lol. Everything costs 3 stone. If you place down something every second it would take 11 minutes run out. You can probably place faster then 1 a second though.

If you use a potion to respec and go hard into carry capacity could probably carry 4k.

Seems only slightly harder with limited carry capacity. 10 minutes to run out and 20 seconds to back and grab 2k more.
                If you got a fast flying mount it wouldn’t be that bad than use pals to increase max load
                    going back and forth any distance is bad. Any time you run out of materials is an interruption to what you are currently building. You have to hold f for a few seconds, fly to storage, land, grab what you need, then fly back, hold f to get off mount, then resume building. That time going back adds up a lot.
            Sure. But they did it with infinite carrying weight and resources Plus other mods. Hence the T-pose flying.
                The t-pose flying is from a glitch that just got patched. Basically the glitch let you equip anything in any slot. If you equipped anything but a glider in the glider slot your glide would be replaced by a t pose
        You can also set building deterioration to zero so anything outside doesn’t go bye bye
            Ok.  That still has absolutely nothing to do with the point I'm making. 




Cool. They built a base in a custom game with infinite resources... It doesn't take that much time when you have the resources customly jacked up to a million percent does it?
                By that standard none of Minecraft builds are impressive because they made it in creative or with third party tools instead of mining cobblestone for months before the project even started. 

This city is impressive not because of resources or logistics, but because building system is wonky and requires lot of finese to get it allign properly like here.
                    That's not the point, nor is this Minecraft.  



>This city is impressive not because of resources or logistics, but because building system is wonky and requires lot of finese to get it allign properly like here.



No. It literally snaps to the foundation.
                You can build quite a lot of stone structure on 250 stone and if there are stone nodes nearby even easier if you got a refined pick axe
Even with unlimited resources and carry weight saying this took "a couple hours" is an understatement.
    No it's not.  It's not Even as cool as my Legit town with decorative interiors on normal settings.
        Agreed.
        Strong copium
            Lol.  I actually have friends to build with and argue over the placement of Town hall.
                You sound so much cooler than this guy
                    That's because I play without Mods.
It's mods for snapping and clipping structures together. No way you get a seamless looking foundation build like this without it.

And if OP did it WITHOUT mods? Honestly even sadder.
Even with unlimited resources and no weight concerns or anything that took way WAY more than a couple hours.
That might be the case for some people, but I absolutely know people collecting unemployment to just sit around lol.
    
Some things you may not understand

- the majority of people choose not to have their unemployment taxed. Resulting in high taxes at the beginning of the year. This ended up financially devastating many families after covid.

- in the modern workforce even three or six months of empty space in your work history is enough to remove you from most application pools

- most people who live off unemployment typically suffer from much much higher rates of depression, high blood pressure and anxiety due to their financial situation. 

If the people you know living off unemployment seem like they're happy they're lying to you. Or they're lying to themselves. It just hasn't caught up with them yet. 

But once the unemployment runs out, the taxes are due and jobs refuse to hire them you will see how quickly they spiraled down. It's going to hit them hard and the longer they're on unemployment the worse it's going to be.

We recently had 2 years of millions of Americans on unemployment to back this up. Your friends are screwing themselves lol
Wait, how do you build bridges? Wouldn't it complain about lack of support quite fast?
    Can't do very high birdges, only ones that's like 3-4 characters tall. 

I raise the foundation as high as possible and build up from there.  Once bridge is built across I delete every other foundation to skip so you can walk under it.
        can you do this over water
Omg that's a great idea 💡
Updating settings now
Haha is that why my one wooden gate blocking the bridge leading to my base keeps disappearing? Dang.
Well that explains why the walls around my base kept disappearing. I thought it was all the raids I just ignore XD
    Yup. Found this out the hard way too. I built a tall castle with one side outside the build radius. Then one time when I logged in, I noticed that part to be missing. My pals already collected the dropped materials and stored them away.

I built it up again, thinking it's wild pals intruding (I have raids disabled). Then it happened again after a few in game days.

I only figured it out while helping a friend edit their own world settings and saw the building decay option.
What about height of your structure? If it's within the palbox radius, is there a height where decay may start? 
    The radius is a cylinder, not a sphere, so height doesn't matter.
It's Pals but thank you, i was curious
    Pokemon. You won't change my mind.
*Palemons
    it's just pals
    Pokepals. They're pocket pals.
Oops, my bad, I thought we were talking about defensive walls (which are 10 stone + 1 cement.)

Cool. They built a base in a custom game with infinite resources... It doesn't take that much time when you have the resources customly jacked up to a million percent does it?
        By that standard none of Minecraft builds are impressive because they made it in creative or with third party tools instead of mining cobblestone for months before the project even started. 

This city is impressive not because of resources or logistics, but because building system is wonky and requires lot of finese to get it allign properly like here.
            That's not the point, nor is this Minecraft.

No. It literally snaps to the foundation.
        You can build quite a lot of stone structure on 250 stone and if there are stone nodes nearby even easier if you got a refined pick axe
Agreed.
Strong copium
    Lol.  I actually have friends to build with and argue over the placement of Town hall.
        You sound so much cooler than this guy
            That's because I play without Mods.
can you do this over water
As someone who builds roofs. Yes, the slanted pieces go on top of the flat part.
    As someone who roofs, the flat part that the slanted part goes on is in fact— also slanted.
        That’s just semantics. Everything is slanted in one way of another.
        As someone who roofies, a slan...where are you guys going?
For an early access with the potential of tons of expansion, and patches - it’s pretty damn good.  It’s an amazing foundation that could have a ton of possibilities.
Eh I think the gameplay to boob ratio is fine tbh
Don't lay around town, I just built you 15 beds!
    and I got all these spheres to give and built a farm to raise your kids
        I think I have the strongest foxparks, but then I meet Mammorest and he only barks
    Go on now, go! Walk through the floor!

Just stand around now. 'Cause you're not working anymore.
this is a discussion.  but if you aren't able to answer the question then we do not have to continue
ROCK AND STONE TO THE BONE
    If you don’t rock and stone, you ain’t coming home
Rock and Stone To The Bone
This comment has no where near enough up votes lol
Yeah I noticed that last night when my chubby electric mouse was hovering above my building making arrows for me and glitches all over the place like Freakazoid. Threw that yellow motherFuacker a million times before he stopped acting the micky.
    A reset can help that if yeeting them at the job keeps saying "automatic work mode"

It sucks, but given the game is early, I'm happy to let them cook.
    Hehehehe I am somewhat confused though it says grenade launcher in the description soooo why am I seeing rocket launchers when that skill activated? 😅
that wasn't their point. If you go outside your base you can only use up to your own weight capacity, and then you'd have to run back in to grab more.
    Running back to grab more isn't a big deal when you can hold like 2k stone or more which will last over 10 minutes probably lol. Everything costs 3 stone. If you place down something every second it would take 11 minutes run out. You can probably place faster then 1 a second though.

If you use a potion to respec and go hard into carry capacity could probably carry 4k.

Seems only slightly harder with limited carry capacity. 10 minutes to run out and 20 seconds to back and grab 2k more.
    If you got a fast flying mount it wouldn’t be that bad than use pals to increase max load
        going back and forth any distance is bad. Any time you run out of materials is an interruption to what you are currently building. You have to hold f for a few seconds, fly to storage, land, grab what you need, then fly back, hold f to get off mount, then resume building. That time going back adds up a lot.
Sure. But they did it with infinite carrying weight and resources Plus other mods. Hence the T-pose flying.
    The t-pose flying is from a glitch that just got patched. Basically the glitch let you equip anything in any slot. If you equipped anything but a glider in the glider slot your glide would be replaced by a t pose
