[[Has your Smash main ever canonically been to Japan If so, in what way]]





Oddly enough Chrom has.

This concludes your emblem fact.
    Also Marth. Technically.
        Explain
            Tokyo Mirage Sessions. Game is set in Japan and Marth is a mirage in that game (I think that’s what they’re called)
                Is Marth there? Itsuki has Chrom
                    Marth is in the game in some capacity. Explaining anymore would be spoiling some stuff.
                They're called Mirages because Atlus and Nintendo didn't want to pay the money to call them what they actually are:  Stands!
                    Didn't realize Stands did J-pop.
                        Their names are based on music/bands and related stuff
                    Are you trying to bait a comparison to Persona? It's always weird to me that JoJo is as old as it is.

It's really funny because as someone who didn't know anything about JoJo until recently the whole thing with stans just seemed like a Persona or a Digimon with less of a personality... Until I found out it predates both by like a decade. (Actually a few months short for Persona 1 and over for the Digital Monster 1.)

Kinda makes sense why they feel like they're doing more interesting stuff with that angle when JoJo had literally already rocked that hard with the base idea.
                        It’s an SMT crossover
                            Correct. Which is why I thought they were baiting the Persona comparison.
    Explain
        Tokyo Mirage Sessions. Game is set in Japan and Chrom is a mirage in that game (I think that’s what they’re called)
Inklings live around what used to be Japan
    Wow really? I never thought about that before but that’s cool
        Yep. Marina states in Octo Expansion that she escaped the Octarian underground via Mount Nantai- a real mountain in Japan.
            But how does she know its name, they don't even speak the same language and I probably missed this dialogue
                Iirc, Octarian (both in the texts we can't see and speech weirdness) is based on Japanese, and it's in the text logs
                    But it's different enough that their language is basically gibberish to them, and it's probably the same other way around. Just like japanese Korean and modern Chinese have the same roots but are gibberish to each other, even kanji in japanese usually means something different from Chinese despite being mostly the same shape
                        It's very possible, but also remember that it's possible they standardized the names, seeing as it would make it easier to reference locations from human texts referring to their name, so they can call it the same thing.
                        Just checked the official map it does look similar when rotated sideways but the official map is 2d and octo canyon is next to inkopolis square instead of under which kinda not make sense but also does???

Also pearl's house is larger than inkopolis(square or not) which is ???
    The whole place is tokyo or sqokyo
Ryu is a Japanese man and his stage is a temple in Japan no?
    Yep, and Ken fights there also, so Ken counts here as well. 

Based purely on the sheer volume of games featuring Terry, I’m going to assume he’s been to Japan as well in at least one of them.
Link has driven in Japan in Mario Kart if that counts.
    Same for the Miis
        And some inklings, villagers, Isabelle, and all the members of the smash cast you’d expect to see in Mariokart normally (Mario, Luigi, Peach, Daisy, Bowser, Bowser Jr./Koopalings, Yoshi, Wario, Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong, Rosalina)
        Yayyy!!!!
    Not the smash link tho
        Breath of the Wild Link is in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, as is the Tokyo Blur course (as DLC)
            Also it's not like there's any canon in Zelda. Link is every iteration of himself and they are all him.
                Well there is canon and it’s all tied together by monopoly
                    A fellow BDG fan?
                        Glad to find some of my people arround here
                        Nice pfp
                    And cannons with superglue
            Yeah I forgot. I still remember how excited I was when that update came out
                Shoulda been Kirby tbh
Kirby is everywhere. You can never escape him…
    Kirby absorbed the universe which includes Japan. Japan has been to Kirby.
    There is literally a Kirby diner in Japan.
        Kirby may be small in stature, but he's HUGE in Japan.
            I’m sorry but my mind can’t handle the way you phrased it and I must let everyone who reads this suffer as I have
Well he lives there soooooo
Steve could just build Japan.
    Correct answer
    Alternate Answer: Minecraft Earth?
    Literally BTE (Build The Earth)
The first alternate universe Bayonetta visits in B3 is the one with her Tokyo variant/Shibuyanetta
    In Bayo 1 she flies from New York to Vigrid (northern Italy-ish)... via Japan.
        Oh yeah, the most ass-backward route possible.
            I assume it was either to throw people off her trail (that certainly worked 😅) or to stretch out the animation to be long enough for the narration.

Or they could just be bonkers. All of New England is Canadian in the Bayo universe, and this is never explained. So who knows what's real?
                It's the latter. You can find Hideki Kamiya's dev-log on Youtube where he plays through the whole first game and explains why her travel route is weird like that.
                    Oh yeah I think I remember that now. I've watched that so many times, but mostly the Maiko Uchida parts 😅
    Shibuyanetta lmao
Ganondorf is a no

Falcon I don’t know

Aegis depends on where >!The Land of Morytha!< is
    Based on my experience playing the game, it’s more in the >!Houston area somewhere in Texas!<.
        How would you know tho??? Its set in the future of our world
            A road sign
            >!this comment was edited instead of deleted but I was gonna say something about the locations being hinted at in game with road signs or the siren model kit iirc!<
        Pls explain
            >!I could be wrong since i learnt more of the lore through Luxin and Enel Videos, but the Klaus experiment, which takes place on Earth, had three towers that connects to an orbital ring around the planet. The one where Klaus was located I believe in Houston? Can't properly recall where the other two were, I think one of them was on an artifical island in the Pacific?!<
                That theory was proven wrong by the Siren Model Kit. In which it was stated >!the Beanstalks were all built on the Equator, which Houston is not. Judging by Future Redeemed, it’s probably actually Kenya in Africa!<
                    Ecuador, because funny.

(And better supply lines and land access to more resources.)
        I’m off to Houston to find some swords, who wants to join me?
        Huh??
    given the three >!Space elevators!< are meant to be on the equator, i doubt it
    Thank you. Don’t know their lore.
        Play Xenoblade 2.

Play Xenoblade 2.

Play Xenoblade 2.

Play Xenoblade 2.
Yeah I guess Mario Kart counts. You could also make a very Japanese town in AC and pretend it’s in Japan.
    what if i dress like a samurai and pretend i am in japan? that doesnt really mean im in japan but i mean the other one counts
    Happy Cake Day!
Plant
    Has been to Japan.
I'm 90% terry has been before
    If you count the Japan stage in King of fighters then definitely. If you don’t I’m not sure but it’s still possible.
Sora goes to Shibuya in the end of KHIII Re Mind and was also shown for the trailer for KHIV, but it's called Quadratum.
    EYY FELLOW SORA MAIN
WE LOVE KINGDOM HEARTS‼️‼️‼️
I don't believe Japan exists when Lucas is born.
    Lucas only exists in Japan though
        Hmm. Yeah, can't argue with that one.
        (Cries in mother 3 fan)
Joker is a Japanese guy in a Japanese game on a Japanese setting who was sent on probation to Tokyo. So no
    He miiiiiiiight be in Japan 🤷🏻‍♀️ who know
        Last time I checked I heard he was in Vatican city but that was a while ago, idk about now
As of the trailer for Kingdom Hearts 4, Sora has officially been to Japan

People even doxxed his apartment
He and Mario went together for te olympics
    I completely forgot about that game 💀
Jigglypuff originated from Japan, is in a region based on Japan, and is beloved in Japan
    There is also Pokémon go, with Jigglypuff (and all the other Pokémon I'm pretty sure) can appear all over real life Japan
        And that means Pikmins have also been to Japan because of Pikmin Bloom
    Technically you’re right for the wrong reason 

Kanto is an actual region in Japan and iirc so is Jhoto
    well i guess hero is from a game made by japanese developers 💀💀💀
        No, the Kanto region in Pokemon is based on the Kanto region of Japan. That's why Jigglypuff has been to Japan.
            There's also that Tecmo spinoff game where it took place in medieval Japan.
        Hero has been to a region inspired by Japan (at least Eleven has)
            Jipang lol
Hoshido is basically Japan.
    But is it actually Japan?
        Well it's separated from... Europe? By a mere bridge across a ravine, so... no...?
            They shrank the Silk Road, eliminated half the Eurasian Plate (or shifted it down/up), shifted the ocean separating Japan from mainland Asia southward towards the coastal areas, and boom, Fateslandia.
    Rare Corrin main spotted (I thought it was only me)
Depends if you consider Pokémon’s Kanto to be the same as Japan’s Kanto.
    I'd say yeah at least in the beginning of the series.  Surges nickname was the lightning American so real world nations are implied to exist.
        And Mew was written to be found in South America. And Indian/African elephants have been mentioned in the Pokedex.
            I forgot about that!
    There is also Pokémon go where all the Pokémon (I'm pretty sure) can appear all over real life Japan
One lives in japan, the other got isekai'd into japan
    Explain
        Joker lives in tokyo and kingdom hearts spoilers
        Joker lives in tokyo and kingdom hearts spoilers
            Dementia💀
            Ah yeah. Still waiting for more infos about Kingdom Hearts IV
Bowser in Mario Kart Tour, and the Tokyo Olympics.
Currently it's Mewtwo. Tchnically the Kanto region is an actual place in Japan, and back when it was introduced Pokémon still ran on the logic that the Pokémon games and anime took place in the real world with real animals. So, by a *huge* stretch of logic, yes.
    Mew was also discovered in Guyana, a real world country, but I think they retconned that since the lore of Pokémon was still in its infancy when Red/Blue came out.
I don’t think Lucas has. He has been to a silly little town, a goofy forest, ummm… that stupid fucking highway, and a city.
    Depressed kid with powers has not been to Japan.
        I agree
Mega Man, Yamato Man's stage
    And Tengu Man
Joker literally lives there, for one

And at the end of KH3, Sora ends up in Quadratum, which is very similar to Shibuya
Sonic has been to his world's equivalent of Asia but Chun-Nan is more China than Japan. You can count it if you want, but technically no.
    He also went to the Olympics in Japan.
        This is technically true, I forgot about that!
        Twice, possibly. First time was probably the mobile game, if its events are canon, and I think they could be because near the start of the adventure in that video game Bowser and Eggman used (and also got trapped in), Sonic tells Mario to “just ask if he has any questions”, because he’d be at Mario’s side the whole journey (personally see that as evidence that they’re good friends now as well).
I mean, maybe? There’s not really any evidence of where Mega Man takes place
    There actually is. 

Mega Man 8 has [a world map](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GF4Ws9uq8OA/maxresdefault.jpg) for all the stages when you pick them. According to this map Dr. Light’s lab is in Denver, Colorado.

Also according to this map, Tengu Man’s stage is in Japan, so Mega Man counts!
    [There's the OVA where he gets  isekaied to Japan.](https://youtu.be/AXBtQw23s50?feature=shared)
    There’s a special where Megaman gives a kid a tour of Japan so
    Yamato Man stage from Mega Man 6
Not my main, but Lucas has never been outside of Japan
    Isn't Lucas American? New Pork City?
        Mother 3 takes place in the Nowhere Islands (not based on anything specific).

New Pork City is a city made by the main villain.
            I always just figured the Nowhere Islands and New Pork City were both meant to be references to the US. They're both in the same location aren't they? Or am I misremembering?
                Only New Pork City is a reference and its supposed to be a recreation since the actual US and Eagleland are destroyed by the time Mother 3 happens.
        Lucas is a Nowhere Islander, when most of the world has been destroyed.

New Pork City isn't American. It's Porkynese.
            New Pork City is a satirical reference to New York City
        I just made a joke about mother 3 being Locked away in Japan. Idk about new pork city or anything sadly
            Bruh I'm so sorry idk how I completely missed that 💀
I don’t think Japan even exists in Hyrule
    I mean link has technically been to Japan in Mario Kart 8
        Touché.

Technically that was regular Link though.
            Yeah technically but as someone said every version of Link is still him
                So by that logic, pretty much every Mario character has cannonically been to my home country….

Fuck yeah, eh!
                    Same here lol not only that but in my home city 
Sydney
                    Same here! Sadly it was just the capital when we have a ton of better places but it's still cool
                        To be fair; I probably would have preferred Ottawa or Montreal to Vancouver. But I am glad they didn’t just pretend the only Canadian city is Toronto.
                            In my case it was Madrid over Barcelona, Segovia, Granada or whatever else when Madrid is just not as interesting of a city but I appreciate that Spain is in the game at all
                                You’re not wrong at all. 

From a foreigner’s perspective, I’d much rather visit Barcelona than Madrid from what I’ve heard. 

There’s a lot of cities that I’m surprised were snubbed even outside our own countries. 

You’d think Monte Carlo would be perfect for such a concept.
                Toon Link isn't actually Link's reincarnation iirc
                    Wat
                    ![gif](giphy|WhTC5v5qQP4yAUvGKz|downsized)
                Although Toon Link is one of few Links that isn’t a reincarnation since Ocarina of Time Link left that timeline.
    I mean, Kakariko village is heavily based off it?
He has only ever fought a Japanese dude, not been there sadly
Pikachu and Pichu literally live in japan
Yup. Joker be saving Shibuya daily bro
My main has a japanese-styled design but i dont think theyve ever been
He's from Japan so he's been to Japan by default
I’m pretty sure they have piranha plant urinals in Japan somewhere
Yeah, he lives there (Joker)
One of the DLC tracks in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is Tokyo Blur, and Piranha Plant is an item in that game so I guess it counts
Cloud: Nope. Wutai is basically an amalgamation of Japan and China.

Pokémon: Generation 1-4 are inspired by Japan but that’s closest. 

Roy: Nope
    Wasn't Roy in mirage sessions fe which is in japan?
        Roy was planned for TMS when the game was supposed to be an actual crossover but he wasn’t included in the final game. 

It’s just weird that the only direct references to SMT Human characters are DLC costumes in the final game.

https://youtube.com/watch?v=OK5-EIzDtKo
    Pokemon GO exists.
I don't think Icicle Mountain is in Japan, so no
I'm able to make Japan in Minecraft if I have enough time, patience, and skill so there's that
I’m not sure if link has but lucario has (Pokémon go)
    Link is in MK8 which has a Japan track
        For a second I thought you were talking about mortal kombat
            Mortal Kombat also has Japanese characters like Scorpion and Kenshi
rockman upon a star

a three episode ova that mostly takes place in japan
    There's also Yamato Man's stage
No but he’s part Japanese
I mean Ganondorf had Katanas in Wind Waker, right?
The earlier Pokemon regions are in Japan so Pichu is literally from Japan
Pikachu.... If Kanto and other Japan based regions count then yeah. If those not count and it has to actually be Japan then... I guess we got Pikachu in Japan during the last world championship? Idk
I don’t think she has been to earth much less japan
    She was born and raised by her parents on Earth Colony K-2L… but then one day Ridley showed up.
        Okay but was she actually on earth?
Most technically have because Nintendo is in Japan sooo✌🏻
I'm not entirely sure, but I believe that Terry has been to Japan for fights or some other stuff involving lore
Joker, he lives there
Bowser has visited Tokyo via Mario Kart Tour.
ofc the three kirby characters been to japan
Depends where the world of *The Legend of Zelda* takes place in.
Well, he’s been to Transylvania. Thats about it.
Japan doesn't exist on popstar
    Yea it's on shiver star
        (Or the Forgoten land)
In the way showed in your post I guess
Is greninja from japan?
    France since Kalos is based that country.
    I mean, greninja is in Pokémon scarlet and violet. Kitakami is basically Japan.
        He’s also able to be transferred to Hoenn, which is based on southern Japan
            And tbh you can count pokemon go too lol
Ryu’s nationality is Japanese. Same goes for Kazuya, sorta
…I mean… Mr game and watch was like only in Japan but idk about the game… but JOKER! Now HES been to Japan
Clearly
Closest Sonic has been is Chun-Nan, the Mobius equivalent of China. So no.
    He was on the Japan Olympics with Mario
        Oh yeah! Forgot about that.
Rosalina raced on Tokyo Blur,(this can apply to any Mario character that’s in Ultimate and 8DX)
Kazuya, literally from japan
Nope. None of Tellius ever had an eastern area.

We never had Japan - so to speak - until Fire Emblem Fates in 2016.
    Tokyo mirage sessions in 2015 crying in the corner
Inkopolis is in what used to be Japan in the world of Splatoon, specifically Tokyo I think. Splatlands and Octo Canyon are probably also Japan.
Kazuya is Japanese

Cloud could probably go to a fantasy version of Japan, but I'm not sure if he actually does.
    [Wutai](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Wutai) is inspired by Japan and China with elements of other asian countries.
Richter hasn't but his descendant, Julius, has.  So has Alucard.

(Aria of Sorrow takes place in Japan, the solar eclipse of 2035 where the castle is sealed occurs then).
I mean maybe? We dont really know where the circuit fights take place. Hes fought a japanese man tho
Pretty sure both Inkopolis and Splatlands are located in post-apocalyptic Japan, so, kinda yeah?
Toon Link, I don't think so but if you guys have info of Japan in Wind Waker or Minish Cap let me know
    I don't think inklings have either
Don’t know, never played tekken nor do I know any of the lore. I’m assuming kazuya is Japanese though
    I read a post that he was japanese but decided to not be one anymore and idk how that works
    He's Japanese and has indeed lived in Japan, along with the rest of his insane family that all want to kill each other.
Considering a lot of random things in Japan happens, yeah
I have no fucking clue lmao
Is Sheik inherently Japanese as a sheikah/shinini/ninja?
[deleted]
Why
Me who mains random button
Joker might’ve been, idk
Yes and no since I always choose random
Idk
I doubt cloud and seph have. Incin is a possibly
I don't have a main I play a fe characters some of which are from pokemon and I don't know if any regions take place in Japan so maybe
No
probably has
It depends on where the F-Zero tracks actually are geographically, but I guess not explicitly.
Ridley is just Godzilla, so yeah
I just make a Mii of Sakurai and bam
Terry is him in the US and Japan.

Thanks for comming to my Bogard talk.
I’ve had 5 mains over the course of my life.

-Ness lives in Eagleland, doubt Japan is in there.

-Zelda has likely never been to Japan.

-Wario has gone go-carting in Tokyo before.


-We know that PNF-404 is what used to be Earth, but have no clue what parts of Earth Olimar has set foot in.

-I don’t think that Samus has ever been to Earth. There’s more important planets to visit.
    Olimar is kinda arguable. Some items you can find point to him landing in a japan. Based on the version, some items in Pikmin were actually from some completely different manufacturers. For example, while you can find a Duracell battery in the European version of Pikmin 2, the Japanese version has one from a japanese brand.
        The area maps in 1 and 2 use stock photos of Hokkaido, take that as you will.
Steve: what is this place Japan you speak of? Is it some sort of biome they added in a new update?
Yes. Joker persona 5 was born and raised in Japan
Yes.
dont think midgar is japan
i think joker might’ve been to japan like once or twice (he lives there)
I could assume Olimar has landed somewhere in Japan at some point.
    In Japanese Pikmin 2 there's Japanese treasures so he probably landed in Japan then
Joker mains feasting
end of kh3, shibuya crossing
Doc has been in Japan it's just that people don't know why...
Joker, i mean, he lives there
Hero can go to a Japan adjacent, so I *guess*...?
Dubiously canon, pokemon only has a Japan equivalent and even then I don't think you can bring Incin there
Sora from Kingdom Hearts got kinda in Japan. His body and soul was sent to a similar dimension as Japan. In the KH universe, this place is called Quadratum and is somewhat an afterlife place.
If we’re counting Doc as the same character as Mario ya, if not ig the doc costume in odyssey in bowsers castle?
I don’t think so, I think it would have been in the news.
Wario and Luigi can race in Tokyo, I’m not so sure about Dedede.
My main lives in Japan
Falco.

He's not even from the Milky Way.
Fun fact: in the new Tekken you can actually see that Kazuya has no nationality because he relinquished his Japanese nationality

…so yeah he’s been to Japan of course
He’s only my secondary and I haven’t played any of his origin games, but I’m pretty sure Ken has been to Japan at least once since Ryu is from there

As for Greninja (my actual main) I think it’s safe to say he hasn’t, since none of the Pokémon games he’s available in are inspired by Japan iirc but I very much could be wrong so please correct me if so

Edit: Correction, Greninja has technically been to Japan as it is usable in ORAS, where the region of Hoenn is based on an island in Japan
    Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, while Greninja can’t be obtained natively, it can be traded in from X and Y.
        Oh yeah you’re right I completely forgot about those games, and they are based on an island in Japan so Greninja has technically been there
Probably not
Sora has, Steve Minecraft is tricky

Ganondorf nah
probably not 💀
The Suzaku Castle and Mishima Dojo stages are in Japan, which means every character has actually been there, or at least could go there.
Yes, he was kicked out of his Reality for breaking multiple nature taboos to the point his reality banned him.

Even has a 1.2 Millon dollar apartment in Aoyama which is in Tokyo that got [doxxed.](https://twitter.com/aitaikimochi/status/1513163361571143684?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1513198659021778948%7Ctwgr%5E4e134933fe6224f27f3a17692041ea86b49af44e%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fembed%2Finset%2Fiframe%3Fid%3Dtwitter-1513198659021778948autosize%3D1) Needless to say dude is living the highlife after saving his reality 3 times and being banished from it.
Mewtwo lives in an area based on Japan.

Byleth and Lucas don't, to my knowledge.
    Yamato Man stage
The Rockman anime (the one based on Mega Man 5) takes place in Japan.
Idk, the only fire emblem I've played was a little of the 1st game on the NSO thing, so IDK if Ike ever went to Japan or not, but the first comment I see on this post confirms that FE has Japan, so it's a possibility
    Ike wasn’t in the Japan FE game, but he can be summoned with his amiibo to FE Fates which has two main countries one of which being Hoshido and it is just bootleg Japan so sorta?
He lives there.
Yeah
Not Duck hunt
Ness is literally the universe so probably
Joker yes

Sephiroth Japan doesn’t exist

Claud Japan doesn’t exist

Banjo and kazooie 80% sure Japan doesn’t exist

Shulk spoilers no

Pyra/Mythra spoilers no

Byleth Japan doesn’t exist
Well..Kazuya is japanese..as well as cloud?? But Does Gaia even have japan? Or countries?
Im sure at least 1 pikmin area has been set in what used to be japan
Inkling lives in former Japan.

Sora has been to San Fransokyo, so kinda(?)
ROB is the only one to actually be in people's homes in his intended way.
Mega Man has been into Japan in that one Anime OVA
    And in Mega Man 6
Mewtwo is from Kanto, Kanto is a region in Japan

Joker is straight up from Japan

Bowser went to Japan in Mario Kart
I don't think so... Pretty sjre you never leave Greece
I haven’t played Persona But the setting is in Tokyo so I would assume joker went to Japan before
Mewtwo was created in Kanto, a real Japanese region. I doubt Japan is canon anymore, but Mewtwo has been in it’s universe’s equivalent.
At least a few of mine have
Considering how there’s almost no info on ice-climbers, I doubt it.
Ehh, probably...
Greninja is forever stuck in France
Yes and no, no
No idea
Has Samus ever actually been to earth?
Terry is fighting in japan
Does Sora count?
He lives there, so…
He lives there.
Any Smash character that's in Mario Kart automatically qualifies
Zelda: no
 
pokemon trainer: no (but kanto is based on japan)

Ike: no
In the final smash, Sephiroth destroys it
The setting of the Persona games is literally just Japan lol
Sora- Hard to say

Isabelle- Yes

Greninja- Yes

Bowser Jr.- Yes

Joker- Yes

Lucas- No

Marth- No

Lucina- No
i mean, that was Bowser’s planet.  i am not sure if that was Japan.
I think Terry Bogard has been to Japan in multiple instances, don't quote me on that because I'm not well-versed in SNK lore...
Has mii brawler been to Japan?
Little Mac beat up a Japanese dude twice so like idk if that counts

Joker lives in Japan

Ness didn’t do anything related to Japan

Apparently Mario’s been to Japan according to that art.

Mii Brawler really depends
sora's dead in qua- i mean, uh, shibuya
Just realized that with Pokemon go every pokemon can be in Japan (and most of the world for that matter)
Joker lives in Japan, Steve makes Japan.
I don’t need to explain why joker has been to Japan
My main is Ryu, sooo, I don't really know.
Fatal Fury/KOF has some stages in Japan.
Technically yes
He’s in Quadratum
I’m afraid joker has never been to Japan which is quite sad
Johto is in Japan, so I assume yes.
Mewtwo kinda has? Kanto is based off of a location within Japan, however it isn’t Japan itself. If we’re including commercials, then they absolutely have.

Joker, my secondary, quite literally lives in Japan so that’s an easy yes.
You could take Incineroar to the land of Kitakami in Pokémon S/V DLC, though I’m not sure if we’re counting places based off a region in Japan.
Diddy has never been to japan so 😭 guess there’s that
kiryu kazuma has had many unhinged violent street brawls there
Mario goes to Japan in MKT/MK8DX in the track Tokyo Blur (plus, he was in Japan in the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games ad)

Sonic goes to japan in the short of the Sonic Movies universes "Around The World In 80 Seconds" and in a episode in Sonic X.
    (oh, and there is a whole game that they go to the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games but that's the boring answer)
The Kanto region in Pokemon is technically part of Japan, right?
Daisy has because of Mario kart tour
Byleth hasn’t (not even a Japan inspired fictional place) 
Corrin has hoshido
Joker lives in Japan
I don't main anyone I play almost half the roster.

My most played is Banjo though and i'm pretty sure the closest he gets to a real world location is a ship that was made in Twycross England.
Problem with liking so many characters is idk who my main is.
I got absolutely nothing on Dr. Mario tbh
One of my Main's is Mega Man so... Yamato Man stage from Mega Man 6
yes
Uhhhh

I don't think so, unless the WVBA takes place in Japan
In bayonetta 3 she travels in the first universe of the game and she ends up in japan
Duck Hunt was first released in Japan.
Joker lives there
Hm... yeah, I guess? Quadratum is more than likely literally just Tokyo, not to mention the weirdness of BH6's San Fransokyo being a potential Japan location.
If Mario Kart Tour/8 Deluxe (Tour Tokyo Blur) counts, Daisy has been canonically to Japan
Idk if Ness was, Lucas deffinetly wasnt
My main is joker. He lives there.
Terry probably has been there for the KOF tournaments, Kazuya was born there but relinquished his citizenship, don’t know about Sora
Ryu.
Bit hard when cloud lives on a completely separate planet
he lives there
Mine literally lived in Tokyo for a year
My main is Joker…
Mario Kart Tokyo track.  
In the Super Mario series, the closest would be something like bowser's kingdom in Mario Odyssey (baloon world)
new york only baby

![gif](giphy|3oz8xMVX8XXwlOOmtO|downsized)
Yes and no.
Kanto, Johto, & Sinnoh are based on Japanese regions.
Well, I think Ken probably went to his boyfriend's country
Oddly enough he renounced his Japanese citizenship
Joker
Me who mains random
Yes. KH4 and KH3:remind
Pac-man probably haven't but I'm not sure about mr game-and-watch
Plant boi is in Super Nintendo World
sora is in real life shibuya, tokyo in kingdom hearts 4
Many warioware minigames take place in japan
weeb
I think Wario was in one of his games and mewto may have somehow.
He IS from japan.
I don't think so. He fought someone that's japanese.
you might not believe this but kazuya has been in japan before
I mean the Pikmin planet IS earth so maybe olimar went to what was japan
Joker lives there and the Inklings live on the remnants of it
He comes from a place inspired by Japan,so technically
Yes! 

Terry - has gone several times due to multiple stages being located in Japan (most notably fighting Mai Shiranui in Fatal Fury, or fighting Team Japan in King of Fighters) 

Ryu - IS from Japan

Ken - lived in Japan training with Ryu 

Kazuya - IS from Japan
Joker, he lives there
Joker Lives in japan (also he goes to multiple different places in japan in persona 5 strikers)
Joker lives in Japan 😭
Well… joker
Yep!

https://zeldauniverse.net/2023/11/20/nintendo-to-reveal-life-sized-ganondorf-statue-alongside-link-in-japan/
I don’t think Japan exists in Steve’s universe
Yes, he lives there
Rosalina’s raced in Japan. Sora hasn’t visited Japan, though the fact that many Disney movies take place on Earth means that he very well could visit Japan.
Marth: What the hell is Japan?
i don't know mega man lore

edit: i looked it up and found mega man went to japan in the cartoon "Mega Man: Wish Upon A Star" and i found it was canon so yes
Luigi has in some art I think
Has Rob?
The pokemon have got to count for this
Joker fucking LIVES in Japan.
I mean ROB was definitely sold in Japan so yeah
Uhh... Idk where Hyrule is...
If you think about it hard enough Midgar is basically Japan
He was banished to Japan for bringing everyone back from the dead
bayonetta has been to tokyo in bayonetta 3
Unless Hyrule is mysteriously in Japan, no
Sonic is the mascot of SEGA, a Japanese game company. So he's probably been to Japan. Also, him and Mario competing in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics (but that might not be canon, though. I'm not sure)
Snake’s technically a mashup of both Solid and Big Boss but I’m not sure either of them actually went to Japan.
Nope. Unless she did a random bounty hunt there offscreen.
She's in the picture attatched to this post so yeah. (Plus Tokyo Blur in MK:Tour)
Does San Fransokyo count as Japan?
steve can probably build it
Don't think so.
He'd be way too big to fit on the trains, anyway...

Now, don't quote me on this, but I've heard he's a die hard fan of a certain Minnesota boy band that were popular in the early 2010s....
If you know, you know.
MOSHI MOSH KIRBY, KIRBY TAYOOO
Dont think so, but NEW YORK CITY BAYBEEE (that movie was... a movie)
Bowser Jr. and all the koopalings are playable in MK8D and Tour Tokyo Blur is a track
Every single Persona 5 game takes place in Japan.
𝕂𝕚𝕣𝕓𝕪
Mine’s from there
I have 2 mains, so...

Joker just straight up lives there.

Pyra (and by extension, Mythra) lives in a world where Japan used to exist, but doesn't anymore... So they've likely never been.
As far as I know, only in the Olympic Games if those are canon. I might be wrong, though
Mine Depend on wether you Consider Kitakami Japan, Alonside Sinnoh,Jhoto and Kanto For Incen

How much you are Willing to Strech a Single Line Said by Papyrus about Sans Being in Fortnite, and If Mega City Counts as "Japan" or "Artemis" considering there are No Laws about What happens if a Country Suddenly Teleports to and Crushes another, because a Gay Knight Voiced by Joker/Anouncer Was Stalked by the Concept and Ruler of Nothing (Same goes for Slayer, just without the Papayrus shit)
bayonetta has in bayo 3, she did it when she was in an alternate universe but japan was basically the same more or less
Well I main Joker and well…the dude lives in Japan…
Piranha Plant is an item in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, which has a Japan racetrack, so yes
Persona 5 takes place in Japan
Canonically I would be worried if they didn’t
Im pretty sure at least one of the Game and Watch games took place in Japan...
Joker lives in Japan. :/
From the top of my head i know, sonic, ryu, ken, terry, kazuya, joker, Bayonetta and any pokemon have visited or have gone to a place very similar to japan
Steve makes Japan
Not to my knowledge
Sora went to China when he met Mulan, but I don’t recall him ever going to Japan.
I don't think Wii Fit Trainer has been anywhere outside of the studio
Corrin was born in Hoshido, which is highly inspired by Japan. So... maybe??
Min Min. She has to travel the whole world to win the ARMS tournament.
The area maps in Pikmin 1 and 2 use edited images of Hokkaido, and PNF-404 is Earth. Olimar has been to Japan, but not Alph.
Well does it HAVE to be called japan? If so no if not then yes the technically LIVE in japan
build the earth
Pyra and Mythra - Japan doesn't exist.

Red/Leaf - Kinda? Kanto (and Johto too) are based on japan
I think Kazuya Mishima might be a japanese man not sure tho
"World Circuit's all yours Mac!"
You can make mii brawler japanese
I main Ike so I have literally no idea, I've never played fire emblem but play like half the FE characters because I think they're cool.
Well yes
He lives there
Mine literally lives in Japan in all 3 games guess who
Bowser has been to Japan
Technically in Mario Odyssey, Bowser can be seen leaving from a Japanese influenced world.
Sephiroth, and he speaks fluent Japanese so I guess so?
Captain Olimar has gone to tropical wilds before, according to an official map, tropical wilds is the entire continent of Asia
I haven’t, so no
He lives there
bayonetta went to japan in bayonetta 3
Depends on who flew out to fight who when Little Mac fought Piston Honda
bayonetta with some multiverse shit
i don’t think pit has ever been to japan before. at least as far as i know
Ness hasn't, where ever poo is from would be the closest place
Eh,lil Mac has fought piston hondo. So maybe he has gone to Japan once.🤔🤷 maybe..idk.
No mucho, solo el EMPERADOR DE SU PROPIO MUNDO JAPONÉS (Bowser, Mario Odyssey)
Minecraft has a toyko pack (for bedrock users) sooo yea

Idk about pythra or palu tho
He fucking lives there
If Kirby is in the real world because of his cafe dedede is probably there in some form
I don’t think Game & watch has been to Japan 🧐
Pikachu has been to Japan.

There are a lot of pikachu plushies with Japanese themes, the series is supposed to originally take place in "japan", most of the pikachu dancers are in Japan with all the little skits they do.  Also, there's a day in Japan series of collectibles featuring Pikachu.

You _could_ conceivably argue that not _all_ Pikachu have been to Japan, but it's a fact that at least one has.

This brings to question which pikachu is the Smash Ultimate pikachu, and have they been to Japan?

One key thing we know about the Smash Ultimate pikachu: one of the skins is a female pika (pikachu libre), all the rest are male.  So, it's conceivably multiple pikas.  Said female could be Cosplay Pikachu from the games, or pikachu Libre from Pokkén (from Ferrum), or Pikachu Libre from the card games, or Libre from the series.

It's likely that one of them will have been to Japan.
Min-Min in her smash reveal trailer together with Captain Falcon eating ramen
I think captain falcon and dark pit did
This is probably a long shot but what about King Dedede?
I mean, Joker lives there
Yes both in canon and non. Sonic has multiple levels Japan inspired and straight up within them along with Mega Man with Yamato Man’s stage in Mega Man 6 although in an OVA he has been to Japan 3 separate times.
That's the entire point of Ryu...
He lives there
I believe Mega Man had to go to Japan to fight Yamato Man in Mega Man 6.
I don't know if you guys are gonna believe this....Joker has been to Japan
my main is kirby, and he went there to commit mass genocide
I think dasiy has in mario kart tour cause of her outfit
Greninja - pokemon is originally from Japan
Yes, in the M&S Olympic Games of Tokyo 2020.
in less japan is in hyrule then no
Also Marth. Technically.
    Explain
        Tokyo Mirage Sessions. Game is set in Japan and Marth is a mirage in that game (I think that’s what they’re called)
            Is Marth there? Itsuki has Chrom
                Marth is in the game in some capacity. Explaining anymore would be spoiling some stuff.
            They're called Mirages because Atlus and Nintendo didn't want to pay the money to call them what they actually are:  Stands!
                Didn't realize Stands did J-pop.
                    Their names are based on music/bands and related stuff
                Are you trying to bait a comparison to Persona? It's always weird to me that JoJo is as old as it is.

It's really funny because as someone who didn't know anything about JoJo until recently the whole thing with stans just seemed like a Persona or a Digimon with less of a personality... Until I found out it predates both by like a decade. (Actually a few months short for Persona 1 and over for the Digital Monster 1.)

Kinda makes sense why they feel like they're doing more interesting stuff with that angle when JoJo had literally already rocked that hard with the base idea.
                    It’s an SMT crossover
                        Correct. Which is why I thought they were baiting the Persona comparison.
Explain
    Tokyo Mirage Sessions. Game is set in Japan and Chrom is a mirage in that game (I think that’s what they’re called)
Wow really? I never thought about that before but that’s cool
    Yep. Marina states in Octo Expansion that she escaped the Octarian underground via Mount Nantai- a real mountain in Japan.
        But how does she know its name, they don't even speak the same language and I probably missed this dialogue
            Iirc, Octarian (both in the texts we can't see and speech weirdness) is based on Japanese, and it's in the text logs
                But it's different enough that their language is basically gibberish to them, and it's probably the same other way around. Just like japanese Korean and modern Chinese have the same roots but are gibberish to each other, even kanji in japanese usually means something different from Chinese despite being mostly the same shape
                    It's very possible, but also remember that it's possible they standardized the names, seeing as it would make it easier to reference locations from human texts referring to their name, so they can call it the same thing.
                    Just checked the official map it does look similar when rotated sideways but the official map is 2d and octo canyon is next to inkopolis square instead of under which kinda not make sense but also does???

Also pearl's house is larger than inkopolis(square or not) which is ???
The whole place is tokyo or sqokyo
Yep, and Ken fights there also, so Ken counts here as well. 

Based purely on the sheer volume of games featuring Terry, I’m going to assume he’s been to Japan as well in at least one of them.
Same for the Miis
    And some inklings, villagers, Isabelle, and all the members of the smash cast you’d expect to see in Mariokart normally (Mario, Luigi, Peach, Daisy, Bowser, Bowser Jr./Koopalings, Yoshi, Wario, Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong, Rosalina)
    Yayyy!!!!
Not the smash link tho
    Breath of the Wild Link is in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, as is the Tokyo Blur course (as DLC)
        Also it's not like there's any canon in Zelda. Link is every iteration of himself and they are all him.
            Well there is canon and it’s all tied together by monopoly
                A fellow BDG fan?
                    Glad to find some of my people arround here
                    Nice pfp
                And cannons with superglue
        Yeah I forgot. I still remember how excited I was when that update came out
            Shoulda been Kirby tbh
Kirby absorbed the universe which includes Japan. Japan has been to Kirby.
There is literally a Kirby diner in Japan.
    Kirby may be small in stature, but he's HUGE in Japan.
        I’m sorry but my mind can’t handle the way you phrased it and I must let everyone who reads this suffer as I have
Correct answer
Alternate Answer: Minecraft Earth?
Literally BTE (Build The Earth)
In Bayo 1 she flies from New York to Vigrid (northern Italy-ish)... via Japan.
    Oh yeah, the most ass-backward route possible.
        I assume it was either to throw people off her trail (that certainly worked 😅) or to stretch out the animation to be long enough for the narration.

Or they could just be bonkers. All of New England is Canadian in the Bayo universe, and this is never explained. So who knows what's real?
            It's the latter. You can find Hideki Kamiya's dev-log on Youtube where he plays through the whole first game and explains why her travel route is weird like that.
                Oh yeah I think I remember that now. I've watched that so many times, but mostly the Maiko Uchida parts 😅
Shibuyanetta lmao
Based on my experience playing the game, it’s more in the >!Houston area somewhere in Texas!<.
    How would you know tho??? Its set in the future of our world
        A road sign
        >!this comment was edited instead of deleted but I was gonna say something about the locations being hinted at in game with road signs or the siren model kit iirc!<
    Pls explain
        >!I could be wrong since i learnt more of the lore through Luxin and Enel Videos, but the Klaus experiment, which takes place on Earth, had three towers that connects to an orbital ring around the planet. The one where Klaus was located I believe in Houston? Can't properly recall where the other two were, I think one of them was on an artifical island in the Pacific?!<
            That theory was proven wrong by the Siren Model Kit. In which it was stated >!the Beanstalks were all built on the Equator, which Houston is not. Judging by Future Redeemed, it’s probably actually Kenya in Africa!<
                Ecuador, because funny.

(And better supply lines and land access to more resources.)
    I’m off to Houston to find some swords, who wants to join me?
    Huh??
given the three >!Space elevators!< are meant to be on the equator, i doubt it
Thank you. Don’t know their lore.
    Play Xenoblade 2.

Play Xenoblade 2.

Play Xenoblade 2.

Play Xenoblade 2.
what if i dress like a samurai and pretend i am in japan? that doesnt really mean im in japan but i mean the other one counts
Happy Cake Day!
Has been to Japan.
If you count the Japan stage in King of fighters then definitely. If you don’t I’m not sure but it’s still possible.
EYY FELLOW SORA MAIN
WE LOVE KINGDOM HEARTS‼️‼️‼️
Lucas only exists in Japan though
    Hmm. Yeah, can't argue with that one.
    (Cries in mother 3 fan)
He miiiiiiiight be in Japan 🤷🏻‍♀️ who know
    Last time I checked I heard he was in Vatican city but that was a while ago, idk about now
I completely forgot about that game 💀
There is also Pokémon go, with Jigglypuff (and all the other Pokémon I'm pretty sure) can appear all over real life Japan
    And that means Pikmins have also been to Japan because of Pikmin Bloom
Technically you’re right for the wrong reason 

Kanto is an actual region in Japan and iirc so is Jhoto
well i guess hero is from a game made by japanese developers 💀💀💀
    No, the Kanto region in Pokemon is based on the Kanto region of Japan. That's why Jigglypuff has been to Japan.
        There's also that Tecmo spinoff game where it took place in medieval Japan.
    Hero has been to a region inspired by Japan (at least Eleven has)
        Jipang lol
But is it actually Japan?
    Well it's separated from... Europe? By a mere bridge across a ravine, so... no...?
        They shrank the Silk Road, eliminated half the Eurasian Plate (or shifted it down/up), shifted the ocean separating Japan from mainland Asia southward towards the coastal areas, and boom, Fateslandia.
Rare Corrin main spotted (I thought it was only me)
I'd say yeah at least in the beginning of the series.  Surges nickname was the lightning American so real world nations are implied to exist.
    And Mew was written to be found in South America. And Indian/African elephants have been mentioned in the Pokedex.
        I forgot about that!
There is also Pokémon go where all the Pokémon (I'm pretty sure) can appear all over real life Japan
Explain
    Joker lives in tokyo and kingdom hearts spoilers
    Joker lives in tokyo and kingdom hearts spoilers
        Dementia💀
        Ah yeah. Still waiting for more infos about Kingdom Hearts IV
Mew was also discovered in Guyana, a real world country, but I think they retconned that since the lore of Pokémon was still in its infancy when Red/Blue came out.
Depressed kid with powers has not been to Japan.
    I agree
And Tengu Man
He also went to the Olympics in Japan.
    This is technically true, I forgot about that!
    Twice, possibly. First time was probably the mobile game, if its events are canon, and I think they could be because near the start of the adventure in that video game Bowser and Eggman used (and also got trapped in), Sonic tells Mario to “just ask if he has any questions”, because he’d be at Mario’s side the whole journey (personally see that as evidence that they’re good friends now as well).
There actually is. 

Mega Man 8 has [a world map](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GF4Ws9uq8OA/maxresdefault.jpg) for all the stages when you pick them. According to this map Dr. Light’s lab is in Denver, Colorado.

Also according to this map, Tengu Man’s stage is in Japan, so Mega Man counts!
[There's the OVA where he gets  isekaied to Japan.](https://youtu.be/AXBtQw23s50?feature=shared)
There’s a special where Megaman gives a kid a tour of Japan so
Yamato Man stage from Mega Man 6
Isn't Lucas American? New Pork City?
    Mother 3 takes place in the Nowhere Islands (not based on anything specific).

New Pork City is a city made by the main villain.
        I always just figured the Nowhere Islands and New Pork City were both meant to be references to the US. They're both in the same location aren't they? Or am I misremembering?
            Only New Pork City is a reference and its supposed to be a recreation since the actual US and Eagleland are destroyed by the time Mother 3 happens.
    Lucas is a Nowhere Islander, when most of the world has been destroyed.

New Pork City isn't American. It's Porkynese.
        New Pork City is a satirical reference to New York City
    I just made a joke about mother 3 being Locked away in Japan. Idk about new pork city or anything sadly
        Bruh I'm so sorry idk how I completely missed that 💀
I mean link has technically been to Japan in Mario Kart 8
    Touché.

Technically that was regular Link though.
        Yeah technically but as someone said every version of Link is still him
            So by that logic, pretty much every Mario character has cannonically been to my home country….

Fuck yeah, eh!
                Same here lol not only that but in my home city 
Sydney
                Same here! Sadly it was just the capital when we have a ton of better places but it's still cool
                    To be fair; I probably would have preferred Ottawa or Montreal to Vancouver. But I am glad they didn’t just pretend the only Canadian city is Toronto.
                        In my case it was Madrid over Barcelona, Segovia, Granada or whatever else when Madrid is just not as interesting of a city but I appreciate that Spain is in the game at all
                            You’re not wrong at all. 

From a foreigner’s perspective, I’d much rather visit Barcelona than Madrid from what I’ve heard. 

There’s a lot of cities that I’m surprised were snubbed even outside our own countries. 

You’d think Monte Carlo would be perfect for such a concept.
            Toon Link isn't actually Link's reincarnation iirc
                Wat
                ![gif](giphy|WhTC5v5qQP4yAUvGKz|downsized)
            Although Toon Link is one of few Links that isn’t a reincarnation since Ocarina of Time Link left that timeline.
I mean, Kakariko village is heavily based off it?
Wasn't Roy in mirage sessions fe which is in japan?
    Roy was planned for TMS when the game was supposed to be an actual crossover but he wasn’t included in the final game. 

It’s just weird that the only direct references to SMT Human characters are DLC costumes in the final game.

https://youtube.com/watch?v=OK5-EIzDtKo
Pokemon GO exists.
Link is in MK8 which has a Japan track
    For a second I thought you were talking about mortal kombat
        Mortal Kombat also has Japanese characters like Scorpion and Kenshi
There's also Yamato Man's stage
She was born and raised by her parents on Earth Colony K-2L… but then one day Ridley showed up.
    Okay but was she actually on earth?
Yea it's on shiver star
    (Or the Forgoten land)
France since Kalos is based that country.
I mean, greninja is in Pokémon scarlet and violet. Kitakami is basically Japan.
    He’s also able to be transferred to Hoenn, which is based on southern Japan
        And tbh you can count pokemon go too lol
He was on the Japan Olympics with Mario
    Oh yeah! Forgot about that.
Tokyo mirage sessions in 2015 crying in the corner
[Wutai](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Wutai) is inspired by Japan and China with elements of other asian countries.
I don't think inklings have either
I read a post that he was japanese but decided to not be one anymore and idk how that works
He's Japanese and has indeed lived in Japan, along with the rest of his insane family that all want to kill each other.
Olimar is kinda arguable. Some items you can find point to him landing in a japan. Based on the version, some items in Pikmin were actually from some completely different manufacturers. For example, while you can find a Duracell battery in the European version of Pikmin 2, the Japanese version has one from a japanese brand.
    The area maps in 1 and 2 use stock photos of Hokkaido, take that as you will.
In Japanese Pikmin 2 there's Japanese treasures so he probably landed in Japan then
Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, while Greninja can’t be obtained natively, it can be traded in from X and Y.
    Oh yeah you’re right I completely forgot about those games, and they are based on an island in Japan so Greninja has technically been there
Yamato Man stage
Ike wasn’t in the Japan FE game, but he can be summoned with his amiibo to FE Fates which has two main countries one of which being Hoshido and it is just bootleg Japan so sorta?
And in Mega Man 6
(oh, and there is a whole game that they go to the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games but that's the boring answer)
Explain
    Tokyo Mirage Sessions. Game is set in Japan and Marth is a mirage in that game (I think that’s what they’re called)
        Is Marth there? Itsuki has Chrom
            Marth is in the game in some capacity. Explaining anymore would be spoiling some stuff.
        They're called Mirages because Atlus and Nintendo didn't want to pay the money to call them what they actually are:  Stands!
            Didn't realize Stands did J-pop.
                Their names are based on music/bands and related stuff

                Just checked the official map it does look similar when rotated sideways but the official map is 2d and octo canyon is next to inkopolis square instead of under which kinda not make sense but also does???

Also pearl's house is larger than inkopolis(square or not) which is ???
And some inklings, villagers, Isabelle, and all the members of the smash cast you’d expect to see in Mariokart normally (Mario, Luigi, Peach, Daisy, Bowser, Bowser Jr./Koopalings, Yoshi, Wario, Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong, Rosalina)
Yayyy!!!!
Breath of the Wild Link is in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, as is the Tokyo Blur course (as DLC)
    Also it's not like there's any canon in Zelda. Link is every iteration of himself and they are all him.
        Well there is canon and it’s all tied together by monopoly
            A fellow BDG fan?
                Glad to find some of my people arround here
                Nice pfp
            And cannons with superglue
    Yeah I forgot. I still remember how excited I was when that update came out
        Shoulda been Kirby tbh
Kirby may be small in stature, but he's HUGE in Japan.
    I’m sorry but my mind can’t handle the way you phrased it and I must let everyone who reads this suffer as I have
Oh yeah, the most ass-backward route possible.
    I assume it was either to throw people off her trail (that certainly worked 😅) or to stretch out the animation to be long enough for the narration.

Or they could just be bonkers. All of New England is Canadian in the Bayo universe, and this is never explained. So who knows what's real?
        It's the latter. You can find Hideki Kamiya's dev-log on Youtube where he plays through the whole first game and explains why her travel route is weird like that.
            Oh yeah I think I remember that now. I've watched that so many times, but mostly the Maiko Uchida parts 😅
How would you know tho??? Its set in the future of our world
    A road sign
    >!this comment was edited instead of deleted but I was gonna say something about the locations being hinted at in game with road signs or the siren model kit iirc!<
Pls explain
    >!I could be wrong since i learnt more of the lore through Luxin and Enel Videos, but the Klaus experiment, which takes place on Earth, had three towers that connects to an orbital ring around the planet. The one where Klaus was located I believe in Houston? Can't properly recall where the other two were, I think one of them was on an artifical island in the Pacific?!<
        That theory was proven wrong by the Siren Model Kit. In which it was stated >!the Beanstalks were all built on the Equator, which Houston is not. Judging by Future Redeemed, it’s probably actually Kenya in Africa!<
            Ecuador, because funny.

(And better supply lines and land access to more resources.)
I’m off to Houston to find some swords, who wants to join me?
Huh??
Play Xenoblade 2.

Play Xenoblade 2.

Play Xenoblade 2.

Play Xenoblade 2.
Hmm. Yeah, can't argue with that one.
(Cries in mother 3 fan)
Last time I checked I heard he was in Vatican city but that was a while ago, idk about now
And that means Pikmins have also been to Japan because of Pikmin Bloom
No, the Kanto region in Pokemon is based on the Kanto region of Japan. That's why Jigglypuff has been to Japan.
    There's also that Tecmo spinoff game where it took place in medieval Japan.
Hero has been to a region inspired by Japan (at least Eleven has)
    Jipang lol
Well it's separated from... Europe? By a mere bridge across a ravine, so... no...?
    They shrank the Silk Road, eliminated half the Eurasian Plate (or shifted it down/up), shifted the ocean separating Japan from mainland Asia southward towards the coastal areas, and boom, Fateslandia.
And Mew was written to be found in South America. And Indian/African elephants have been mentioned in the Pokedex.
    I forgot about that!
Joker lives in tokyo and kingdom hearts spoilers
Joker lives in tokyo and kingdom hearts spoilers
    Dementia💀
    Ah yeah. Still waiting for more infos about Kingdom Hearts IV
I agree
This is technically true, I forgot about that!
Twice, possibly. First time was probably the mobile game, if its events are canon, and I think they could be because near the start of the adventure in that video game Bowser and Eggman used (and also got trapped in), Sonic tells Mario to “just ask if he has any questions”, because he’d be at Mario’s side the whole journey (personally see that as evidence that they’re good friends now as well).
Mother 3 takes place in the Nowhere Islands (not based on anything specific).

New Pork City is a city made by the main villain.
    I always just figured the Nowhere Islands and New Pork City were both meant to be references to the US. They're both in the same location aren't they? Or am I misremembering?
        Only New Pork City is a reference and its supposed to be a recreation since the actual US and Eagleland are destroyed by the time Mother 3 happens.
Lucas is a Nowhere Islander, when most of the world has been destroyed.

New Pork City isn't American. It's Porkynese.
    New Pork City is a satirical reference to New York City
I just made a joke about mother 3 being Locked away in Japan. Idk about new pork city or anything sadly
    Bruh I'm so sorry idk how I completely missed that 💀
Touché.

Technically that was regular Link though.
    Yeah technically but as someone said every version of Link is still him
        So by that logic, pretty much every Mario character has cannonically been to my home country….

Fuck yeah, eh!
            Same here lol not only that but in my home city 
Sydney
            Same here! Sadly it was just the capital when we have a ton of better places but it's still cool
                To be fair; I probably would have preferred Ottawa or Montreal to Vancouver. But I am glad they didn’t just pretend the only Canadian city is Toronto.
                    In my case it was Madrid over Barcelona, Segovia, Granada or whatever else when Madrid is just not as interesting of a city but I appreciate that Spain is in the game at all
                        You’re not wrong at all. 

From a foreigner’s perspective, I’d much rather visit Barcelona than Madrid from what I’ve heard. 

There’s a lot of cities that I’m surprised were snubbed even outside our own countries. 

You’d think Monte Carlo would be perfect for such a concept.
        Toon Link isn't actually Link's reincarnation iirc
            Wat
            ![gif](giphy|WhTC5v5qQP4yAUvGKz|downsized)
        Although Toon Link is one of few Links that isn’t a reincarnation since Ocarina of Time Link left that timeline.
Roy was planned for TMS when the game was supposed to be an actual crossover but he wasn’t included in the final game. 

It’s just weird that the only direct references to SMT Human characters are DLC costumes in the final game.

https://youtube.com/watch?v=OK5-EIzDtKo
For a second I thought you were talking about mortal kombat
    Mortal Kombat also has Japanese characters like Scorpion and Kenshi
Okay but was she actually on earth?
(Or the Forgoten land)
He’s also able to be transferred to Hoenn, which is based on southern Japan
    And tbh you can count pokemon go too lol
Oh yeah! Forgot about that.
The area maps in 1 and 2 use stock photos of Hokkaido, take that as you will.
Oh yeah you’re right I completely forgot about those games, and they are based on an island in Japan so Greninja has technically been there
Tokyo Mirage Sessions. Game is set in Japan and Marth is a mirage in that game (I think that’s what they’re called)
    Is Marth there? Itsuki has Chrom
        Marth is in the game in some capacity. Explaining anymore would be spoiling some stuff.
    They're called Mirages because Atlus and Nintendo didn't want to pay the money to call them what they actually are:  Stands!
        Didn't realize Stands did J-pop.
            Their names are based on music/bands and related stuff
        Are you trying to bait a comparison to Persona? It's always weird to me that JoJo is as old as it is.

It's really funny because as someone who didn't know anything about JoJo until recently the whole thing with stans just seemed like a Persona or a Digimon with less of a personality... Until I found out it predates both by like a decade. (Actually a few months short for Persona 1 and over for the Digital Monster 1.)

Kinda makes sense why they feel like they're doing more interesting stuff with that angle when JoJo had literally already rocked that hard with the base idea.
            It’s an SMT crossover
                Correct. Which is why I thought they were baiting the Persona comparison.
But how does she know its name, they don't even speak the same language and I probably missed this dialogue
    Iirc, Octarian (both in the texts we can't see and speech weirdness) is based on Japanese, and it's in the text logs
        But it's different enough that their language is basically gibberish to them, and it's probably the same other way around. Just like japanese Korean and modern Chinese have the same roots but are gibberish to each other, even kanji in japanese usually means something different from Chinese despite being mostly the same shape
            It's very possible, but also remember that it's possible they standardized the names, seeing as it would make it easier to reference locations from human texts referring to their name, so they can call it the same thing.
