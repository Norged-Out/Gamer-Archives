[[Is Stray actually a good game How many hours did you get out of it]]


Looks like I can get it fairly cheap, particularly second hand but heard very mixed reviews


It’s… fine. It’s probably around 10 hours tops. It’s quite simple but exploring as a cat has a charm to it.
    This is exactly it. I see some folks deride it as a shit game. Its definitely not shit, but I wouldn't call it great. I'm a cat person and I fucking love cats, but the people who called for it to be a GOTY were huffing the litterbox dust. It definitely has charm to it, and it's worth checking out on sale, but it's nothing that's gonna be remembered by gamers as a whole in a few years.
        When the cat gets the backpack though...
        I disagree in that its the best game ever made for RPing as a cat. 

Not that it has any competition 😅
            A Street Cat's Tale. You straight-up roleplay a cat's daily life. What I didn't expect was how easy it is to, er, "fail." I was expecting more of a cute RPG and less cat survival RPG.
                "Bury your poop before a predator finds it! You have 3 seconds!"
            Little Kitty Big City
                Itty Bitty Kitty City
            Cattails!
                Catrails works as well, yknow since the cats jumping is kinda on rails
            The Mithra race in FFXI and FFXIV would like a word...

If you're into MMOs and wanna play a cat girl, well, there you go. :)
                That's not playing as a cat. It's just being a weeb. It's still fun, but the wrong idea for this
            Cat Quest

Edit, The purring quest also, I liked that one
            But Khajit has wares if you have coin!
            Borgo the Cat
        I think some folks call it ‘shit’ because their expectations were way off from reality. They were expecting a full open-world Cyberpunk with cats from a studio with a couple dozen developers. Wasn’t gonna happen. But with expectations in check, it’s a great little game. 

I do agree though, absolutely not GOTY material, but again, it wasn’t supposed to be. It’s fine for what it was - a cute little story about a lost cat in a ‘cyber’-style world.
            I mean, even if all you were expecting was actual platforming, you'll be disappointed. It's cute, but it has little gameplay - a few puzzles and a little bit of blob dodging.
        Haven’t played the game but it did seem like the game earned its GOTY *nomination*. It definitely wasn’t GOTY but seems like it was an excellently executed game. I currently have it on my wishlist on my Series X, just waiting for a good sale on it.
            I don't think there's really enough *game* there to even nominate it for GOTY, honestly. It's a very well executed little oddity, but (even though I freaking love cats) imo there are many games that have done the 'limited gameplay to tell an immersive story' genre far better. But those games don't have the novelty or name recognition of Stray, so they're overlooked while this one is overexposed.
                I mean people in this thread are being harsh on Stray for limited gameplay but surely Stray’s more complex and longer than something like Limbo, which many people had the same fondness for when it came out.  Some of us are just fine with taking a certain amount of style as a substitute for substance.  A short game with low interactivity but a lot of cinematic beauty isn’t automatically bad.
                    I think you're deliberately missing my point. I said myself that Stray executes its concept well. I figured the implication was obvious but in case you missed it, *I like Stray and I think it's a good game*. I just don't think it's an *amazing* game. Regardless of the genre or scope, that ought to be the bar for a GOTY nomination, right?

>Some of us are just fine with taking a certain amount of style as a substitute for substance.

Again, I think you're mixing up meanings here. There's a difference between a game with low interactivity and a game with little substance.

I love games that function as storytelling devices rather than highly interactive gaming mechanisms. I simply think there are better examples of the genre than Stray. 

>A short game with low interactivity but a lot of cinematic beauty isn’t automatically bad.

I agree. But once again, I did not claim Stray was bad, merely that I think the scope of its ambition is stretched a little thin by the relatively bland gameplay. I'd rather it committed one way or the other.
                        It wasn’t that deep man I just disagree.
                            Don't do that. Don't write out a response but then when I bother to take the time to address what you said, act like you didn't actually care anyway. Why are you commenting on a discussion thread if not to have a discussion?
        I just don't call it a game because it isn't.
        its also a gorgeous game too
        But goats, they will be remembered.
        It'll be remembered. Not because of it's actual gameplay, but still remembered.
        People calling it to be GOTY were mostly trying the rile up  Elden Ring fans, which generally worked.
    What kinda car?
        I wanna say Honda Civic, but I am not a car guy. Can anyone confirm?
            It’s definitely high purrrformance whatever it is.
            Slaps hood this baby can fit so many hours in it
            [removed]
                Good taste.
                I'd hope most people would understand than six great hours is better than forty mediocre hours.  


3 hours of Shawshank redemption is better than 100 hours of QVC on loop.
            A car you can trust!
                Never mind the car, let's talk about the henge
                    What henge is that again?
            Nah it's a Mercury Cougar
        I feel bad that you’re getting downvoted because you happened to post that reply _just_ before you saw that I’d edited my original comment…
            Do the right thing, edit it back to car.
            This is why I always add this bit to the bottom of an edited comment

"Edit: cat, not car"
            😁

    Even though I have to say I didn't *feel* like a cat. Click X to jump here. And then click X to jump there. Those prompts really killed the immersion of swift and sneaky cat movement for me.

But world building and press key to meow were good!
        You can run around holding the jump button to make the transitions more seamless.
            True, but it's still not "free" movement. I would have wished for 100 % control over where to jump and crawl and explore.
                But then it wouldn't jump like a cat? I'm confused. Cat jumps are point A to point B in a very brief instant just like the game did, which is why it was restricted that way. I'm sure you don't mean it should jump like Mario but maybe you're thinking of Little Kitty Big City, where the jump has more freedom but is more floaty which kills some realism. Stray has more realistic environment so it would be jarring if the cat jumped like that.  
  
Cat is small enough to go under cars and if it crawled they'd have to add invisible walls because cats can virtually crawl anywhere. They let you explore roofs? I thought the cat feel was the thing they nailed compared to the rest
        You can also turn off the prompts in the settings. Still no free jumping but it’s less immersion breaking if you need it.
    Isn’t it also on game pass?
        It used to be on PS plus extra or premium, whichever one is basically Sony’s game pass. That may be what you’re thinking. Not sure if it is anymore however.
            yea thats what i was thinking
        No
    Ten hours? It's barely two for a full blind playthrough and about three maybe four to get 100% if you are slow.
    10 hours is a huge stretch, unless you're going to go for all achievements including a 2-hour speedrun.
    I took my time and played it calmly, still only took me 6 hours from start to finish.
    I have played and my opinion:

 - Story and atmosphere are really good (8.5/10)
 - Gameplay is okay (6/10)

The novelty of you being a cat is fun, but not for very long. The "parkour" is pretty railroaded, making it very easy and the opposite of frustrating (I personally see this as a plus).

Some puzzles are a bit tough to figure out, not because they're very hard, but because it's not always obvious what you need to do and the solution might require you to do something seemingly unrelated. Very little subtle hints as well.

Also a relatively short game, but honestly the perfect length. Any longer and it would have dragged on and have become boring.

Definitely experience the game as an exploration game. Just walk around, get a feel for the levels and atmosphere, talk to everyone and gather as much information as possible. Don't attempt to just rush the storyline.
It’s a fun game. Interesting story, cool environments, good amount of exploration, and even some light puzzles and combat. The game itself is fairly short. Probably less than or around 8 hours for a playthrough. If you’ve always wanted to play a game as a cat though it’s a must buy for sure.
    Do you think a 7 year old would be able to play? We just got a PS5 for the family, and my 7yo daughter is feeling left out.
        I'm sure they'd love it, but you might need to help them out in some of the trickier bits.
            When I was 7 and got stuck in a game I would just play the beginning over and over again. And I would like it. Kids these days have it so easy...
                Ugh the Tomb Raider game Undersea or w/e that one was, I dropped it at the start cuz it was too hard for my yet undeveloped brain
                    When I played Tomb Raider as a kid, I just ran around her house while that creepy old butler followed me. The main game was too difficult.
                        Woah flashbacks
                    Men in Black ps1 flashbacks....never did the 1st building jump just kept falling
                    Underworld. I wanna play it again but damn those giant spideys keep me away lol
                I remember just playing the hercules demo that came with my ps1 like 3000x.
                Yeah tutorials were amazing.
                I absolutely LOVED Majoras Mask as a kid but i swear I never got past like the second temple of the game. I think the bull was the furthest i got as a kid. I feel like i spent majority of the time just getting to the first skull kid fight on the final day .

I dont think ive ever completed a mario game. I dont think i finished Donkey Kong country until i was an adult getting into retro games.

Subzero Mythologies I never got past level 2 without cheat codes. I think i just replayed the first level over and over until i was over the game 


Theres something about just being entertained as a kid with games. Didnt have to jump through so many hoops for it to be a good game. You just had fun
            Ehh all the jumping just takes a hit off the bottom. No g real skill needed.
                The Zurk level can be challenging because you have to be fast (and is also a bit creepy for a 7 year old). The stealth levels are better but depending on the skill level they might be a bit tricky.

Keep in mind kids are usually way less coordinated than adults.
        💯.  It was the first game my 5yo nephew played (kinda) well without frustration. 

Altho they can sometimes get stuck in an area n u might need to help them out. 

Also some areas can be a bit creepy so there's that to consider. Nothing hectic though
        Check out untitled goose game.  That's a riot for kids
        Totally, very simple and linear. nothing super intense. Very hand holdy but the charm is in the exploration anyways
        The cute little Astro game that comes with the PS5 is GREAT for teaching about the controller and a basic rudimentary way games work.
            Thanks for the recommendation! Didn't realize that was a playable game, thought it was just a basic tutorial. Both my kids are loving it.
        Yeah it’s not too bad. There are enemies, but you mostly just run from them, and they’re only in a few spots. Mostly just puzzles, exploration, and vibing.
        Yeah I think she would be able to as long as she doesn’t have a tendency to get too frustrated if she has to retry certain parts multiple times. All the jumping is automatic with one button press so you can’t really mess that up. Some of the enemy encounters are challenging and the exploration to find all the collectibles and do the side quests could be difficult as well.
        Yes. There are some chase scenes that might be a bit much so be ready to step in.

Also there's a bambi opening so prep to tell them it'll all turn out fine.
        There’s some robots that can shoot lasers or something at you. Some weird blobs that chase you. So could be scary but depends on the kid
        My 5 year old loves it. There are a lot of good kids out there. Just find what she likes and look for games similar to her interests.
        my 10 year old loved it very much.
At $20 it is a good buy imo.  It's not hard, it's definitely not complex or deep in terms of gameplay, it's just a game where you play a cat in a strange world seeking friends and answers.  It has mild puzzle, stealth, and "combat," sections, but mostly about exploration.

&#x200B;

If you go in looking for some profound and challenging experience you will be disappointed.

&#x200B;

If you go in looking for a heartfelt game where you get to be a cat you will get you 8-10 hours of enjoyment and feel happy.
It has a very cool cyberpunkish vibe and if you like cats, its extra cozy imo. Not a long game, but still a good time.
    Yep, I played it this time last year in the week between Christmas and New years eve. Horrible weather outside and ate good holiday food. 10/10 comfy as fook.
        Exactly how I played too. 10/10
Its more like a visual novel to me. You talk to robots, you bring them things they need. It even got some tears out of me. There are also puzzles and stealth parts.
IMO a good quality game is not meassured by how many hours do you get out of it.

One of my personal favorite games is Fire Watch it's about 6 hours long but such a great game. Visuals, sound design, story, everything is really cool. Also the game does feel longer than it is actually
    Tbh I feel like a 120hr game will inevitably have a lot of repeated actions, there's more change you'll drop it. Short games are much better in this regards
        What games are 120 hours?
            Persona 5
                This is precisely the game I meant. I was so tired of ludicrous farming same types of mobs that act the same I quit the game just before the final boss.
                    When do you ever need to farm or grind in persona?
            Honestly like a fuckload of games but it’s not always quality
            Every mmo, a large portion of rpgs, any sandbox, any rogue like and lite.
            The persona games are crazy long. Dragon quest 11 also took me 100+ hours to 100%.
            Elden Ring took me about 140h to complete for the first time

Witcher 3, about 150h

Baldur's Gate 3, about 120h

Shadow of War, a bit over 100h

...the list goes on, but there's a couple that I can remember.

---

Online / live service games are obviously also up there (I literally have 30 000h in WoW), but I guess you're asking about singleplayer games.
            Games wtih good game mechanics (repeated actions are so fun that you don't mind pressing the same button for 100 hours) like Elden Ring (both visual and mechanical fun) or Enter the Gungeon (repetition is literally the game).
            Lots of games can have 120 hours of content. Or rather, there's games where you can (reasonably) sink 120 hours in.

Like ones with a lot of replayability. RPGs with lots of sidequests. MMOs/live service games. Fighting games.

(There's some overlap in those)
            I'd say oblivion, Skyrim, and Factorio, but those games are at *least* 200 hours.
            The Witcher 3 + DLC's
    They were separate, somewhat unrelated questions, but agree with your sentiment.
    I feel the same about Journey
        So you're saying it's not about the Destiny, but the Journey?
    Exactly how I feel about Edith Finch
    Fire Watch is an awesome game!
    Although I agree there is a limit to this. I can enjoy a 6  to 10 hour well crafted linear game for sure with good replay value but stray is barely 2 hours with no gameplay or replay value at all to speak of and the one mechanic it has is clunk and poorly handled.
        2 hours? Did you play it? Were you rushing?
It's a game that should be savored and played as a cat.
            There's literally an achievement to beat the game in under 2 hours. Casually it will take longer but it's not a long game if you play semi efficiently
        Stray is eight to ten hours long on a blind playthrough.  Are you sure you're not thinking of the speedrun?  Or another game entirely?
            8 to 10 hours is gigantic stretch. The game is not 2 hours like that other guy said but it's about 5h at most, if you take it slowly. You'd have to play the game twice and get all the trophies to get to 10 hours.
Stay IMO is exactly what it’s advertised as: a fun little cat game. The “mixed” reviews IMO mostly came from people thinking it was going to be some mind blowing game of the year epic or something, versus the reality that it was a cute little cat simulator. 

Hell, when it released it was only $30 because they knew it was a short and simple game. It took me around 10 hours or so and is well worth it. It’s not mind blowing but it’s a fun and pretty unique little game.
    Honestly the story was deeper and more emotional than I expected going in, I thought it would just be a cyberpunky cat simulator but I was pleasantly surprised!
    Well it was nominated for GOTY at the Geoff Awards
        Every awards show is bullshit
It's not super long but it's cute. My cat was super interested in the cat on screen, and kept trying to sneak up on it, but would bolt when I turned it to face him. 

If you like cats you will probably like the game, but if you are strictly a dog person you might not be as charmed.
I thought it was great, didn’t understand the hate. It was a cute, simple, straightforward game that had a satisfying finish and gorgeous graphics. Definitely no replayability, but it’s good to experience.
    It got hate? It seemed to me like it was very well loved.
        yeah there was some hate initially, because it was a cat game. People were like “you’re a cat wow so innovative” etc etc
            I don't think that's why there was hate (it was a while ago so maybe I forget). The problem was that it had so much hype surrounding it: the reveal trailer was one of the most interesting I've seen for ages, with such amazing atmosphere and tone. Combine that with Internet cat frenzy, some of the news that came out about how they'd been working on it for quite a while and spent a lot of time trying to replicate realistic cat movement, everyone's imagination went wild on a hugely innovative game.

The atmosphere and tone in the game itself is great, and the story behind it pretty cool, but the game behind it is very simple. Movement and platforming was fairly simplistic and there isn't much to it beyond following the story and the cool world they created. This was reflected in its price, and is clearly all it was ever really meant to be, but expectations are guided by hopes and dreams sometimes.

I thought it was a fun game. Great atmosphere and a nice story, chill to play.
            I think making a game where you play as a cat is innovative lol never understood the sarcasm sentiment behind those statements
                I could definitely understand it being a gimmick but they put a lot of effort into making a cat protagonist be a core mechanic to the game that it felt innovative. It was a pretty well made simulator.
>Novelty of playing a cat

That’s about it.
No, it’s pretty boring just moving forward and hitting x the entire game. People just liked it because “Kitty”. The environmental storytelling is good though
it's one of those games that absolutely wouldn't have gotten any attention, but it initially launched as an exclusive for the ps5 so it got a lot of praise and more of a spotlight for that simple fact (see death loops 10/10 reviews for another example). it's honestly nothing to write home about
    I don't know what you consider ps5 exclusive because Stray was available on PS4 too from day one.    
Agreed that it wouldn't get that much attention if not the circumstances, but it was more about good release date and hype because of cats
I really did not care for it.
I had a lot of fun with it.

I believe I spent about 6 hours on it. I'm not sure of the replayability, but I had a good time.
If it wasn't about a cat it would be dismissed by most people, so just ask yourself if that piece of it would bring you enjoyment.
It's just a walking simulator...
Overhyped

Its cute but boring
I bought it as a cat lover and the idea that I could play as a cat in the game. Had no idea at the time about the robot stuff. I was perfectly content being a cat seperated from my family trying to make it back home.

There was a certain level of endorphins released while playing. Brought my blood pressure down the little of it i played
Fantastic. Made me realise how I much I wanted to play as a cat in a video game.
It's decent, but it was waaay overhyped just because "lol u can be a cat, so random"
It's boring. The main thing that pushed it was twats going "omg kitties"
It’s the same thing over and over.
    Most games are
It's overrated, and boring.
The game is 5 hours long on average. People who say that it's 10 hours are probably expecting you to play it twice or something lol.
I thought it was great fun
6-10 but I loved every Nya-no second of it.
Good fun, not super long

It's not really an action game (a few action sequences), so just make sure you want an atmospheric exploration game with light puzzling.
Extremely overrated. 

First hour or so you should really enjoy, but then you realise there's not much about it unless you want to finish the story or just enjoy lazily exploring a city as a cat.
    Also the story feels incomplete, near the end you would expect to at least see certain characters that showed up at the beginning of the game but it never happens
I had to stop playing because my cat was getting too confused by the cat noises.
I loved it. It’s short. I think 8-12 hours. Being a cat is dope.
It’s charming but like if it wasn’t “OMG CAT ≽\^•⩊•\^≼”… people would be able to see it’s kind a meh game that takes 8 hours tops and it’s just… ok.

If you can get it cheap, it’s great. But I think the people that spent $30 overpaid
It's pretty good, nothing incredible but good. I'm just kinda unreasonably salty it won indie awards over say Tunic. Feel like it got weirdly high mileage out of you playing as a cat
If Stray didn’t have a cat as the protagonist, nobody would’ve played it.
    Exactly. I just started it last night, and you couldn't be more correct. It's a pretty weak platformer, and there's very little to interact with so far anyway.
It's kind of like Myst in a lot of ways.  I think you'll like it more than you'd think.
I found it boring, couldn’t play it beyond a few hours. The cat mechanics are clever and really well done, it’s just a shame they didn’t put the same effort into the world they built. 🤷🏻‍♂️
My wife and I both enjoyed it greatly
Very mid tbh
I got bored about 2 hours in but I can kinda see why people like it, esp if you're a cat person which I'm not lmao
I kinda hated it. I found it a mostly boring puzzle game that makes you waste your time. There are some fun Alan Wake style action sequences but not enough for my taste. It may be one of my least favorite games actually.
It's very okay.  Free was a fine price.
Stray is a short game but tells a cute little story without narration, it is a game to experience as a short experience and is touching in a heartwarming way.
I loved my time with it, and felt sad at the end that I was leaving. It’s like a point and click adventure really, full of charm though. The music is fantastic too, was plenty of times when i’d just vibe out with some bleep funk on the radio. I’d recommend if you like indie games, cyberpunk, robots or cats in any ratio.
I liked it. Not the most robust or challenging game you'll ever play, but it's got an interesting story and some good production value. The puzzles are clever, but short-lived. Pacing is a little random.

Overall it's a great game to get on sale, but don't be surprised if you're left feeling like your meal could have been a little larger.
Neat concept, but I got bored after about an hour
No, it's 5 hours. It's a walking simulator from a cats perspective with a press "A" to progress and nothing happens. It's atmospheric at least, but that's about it.
Maybe 9 to beat it. Was amazing.
There is nothing good about this game beyond the novelty of playing as a cat.
I was so excited for the game when it was frost announced. A puzzle/detective game where you play as a cat? Awesome.

What we got instead was a mediocre platformer with poor excuses for puzzles. It was about 4 hours of boredom for me.
I was glad I played it after I was done. It was adorable and my cat really enjoyed it also
One of my all time favorites to be honest. Visually the most gorgeous game I've ever seen (Im personally a sucker for the nature/cyberpunk aesthetic) and though simple, the story kept me really engaged
You’re asking the wrong question. It’s not about quantity of hours. It’s about the quality of those hours. As with any game ymmv in that regard. For some it was a monumental experience. For me it was a good time with a nice story that didn’t overstay its welcome, which was about ten hours.
    The first question was about quality. The second about quantity.
Very chill interactive experience tier puzzles. Like 10 hours as others stated. I played it in like 5 sessions and found it worth my time, though a bit unmemorable.
Its a fun game with cool aesthetics, but I couldn't help feeling like they could have done a lot more with the concept.
It has a good atmosphere, but the "story" and the gameplay will disappoint if you have big expectations... It's a fine game, but that's it.

You ask how many hours I got out of it, well, personally kind of wish the game would have been a bit shorter \^\^
Great game. I played it for 10 minutes.
I got 8 hours, it's a w.e. It's basically an auto scroller.
It’s surprisingly meh.
I think most of the hate stemmed from it having  meme energy on the internet, and that fueled the attention more than the quality of the game.  I remember it making top five lists for the year for a lot of categories.  While I think it's novel, and a good experience, it is not so great that I would consider it a must-play for that year it came out.  I could see that backfiring and attracting a more varied audience for a niche game - and as such - attracting more negative reviews.  

However, it has a unique feel - and so if you're looking for a pallet cleanser, it might scratch that itch.
I loved it, but I didn't play it to make it to the end as fast as possible.

Fundamentally it is a puzzle/walking/adventure game with not very difficult challenges, combined with moderately tricky action/escape sequences- a number of which I had to play multiple times before figuring out how to make it through.

The real joy of the game is not in the "figuring things out", it is allowing yourself to relish the world it presents (which is beautifully rendered) and slowly learn the story of what is going on.  The cat is rendered and behaves in a delightfully cat-like way.

If you enjoy the atmosphere, the cat-ness of it, and the emotional story, and give yourself time to take it in, then you'll enjoy the game.

I took it in a leisurely fashion, tried to complete as many of the side quests as possible, and reached the end in about 12 hours.   I found the end to be beautiful and moving.
I loved it. Didn't have any pre conceptions but it was one of the best games I played this year. As others have said it is pretty short but well worth getting.
As a video game doing video gamey things, it's not that special. But as a 'cat walking around for 10 hours' experience, it's amusing.
Very fun little game. I recommend it to every cat lover lmao. I've got a plat in less than 8h.
I really liked the game. I had about 10 hours playing it but was really in no rust to finish. I tried to see where I could nap and explore all of the corners. It’s a fun and enjoyable experience to hang out in, but if you are out to beat it the game would probably get thin quickly. 

As a side note, there’s not much replayability to it, but I really want to go back there. I would love them to release an update or DLC that’s just cat’n around the map with lots of stuff to knock over or looking for the best sunny spots to nap. Sometimes, an hour of chilling out as an orange cat is the sim I really want.
10 to 12 hours and I thought it was amazing. I want a Stray 2 open world game now. MOAR KITTAH!
I loved it. It's 10-15 hours or so. I enjoyed the story. It's simple gameplay. You're a cat after all.
Loved it. Ended up getting all the achievements in it too cause it was so fun.
For a cat person, Stray got such cute little detail that they can relate, and that amplify the experience they have playing it. its more like a one time experience game, with little to none replaybility. yet, the few hours spent in this game is worth it. 

Would highly recommend if you are a cat person OP. would also recommend if you like chill short games. wouldnt recommend if you have grudge against cats in general.
I found it touching
I really enjoyed it! As an adventure game it's nice and simple with an interesting investigation plot with a cool art style.

If you can get it cheap it's a worthwhile play.
i liked the game.Played it for around 10 hours.
It's pretty boring and I dropped it after an hour.
No. It's cute and charming but really shallow and over in about five hours.
The idea seemed cool at first but the novelty wore off after about 4 hours. I finished it once, won't be revisiting it. It's an ok adventure game with puzzle solving.
It’s a massive disappointment relative to the high reviews it got but a good time if you go in with realistic expectations. I’d say it’s a 7.5 with +/- 0.5 margin
It's a good game, I think it's worth the full price imo so if you get it discounted then definitely. I played through it once and got 12 hours out of it according to steam.
It looks nice but gameplay it a bit so so. It's basically a modern take on a point and click adventure game with ok game design. If that is something you'd be interested in and if you like cats you'll probably love the game. It has great atmosphere and good esthetic design.
It's a neat little 10-15 game depending on how good you are at puzzles and how often to stop to look at stuff. 

10/10 one of my all time favorite games.
It's barely a game. More of a walking simulator. If you're into that and cats then you might get something out of it, personally I would say go spend your money elsewhere.
No it's not it has no gameplay realy to speak off and it took me less than three hours to get the  platinum blind it was a joke this was a game of the year contender lol don't waste admittedly a very small amount of time on this.
I’ve played it a couple of times (probably more than 30 hours) for fun and speedrun practice. It’s a fun game with a neat story. I love playing it over and over. Do recommend giving it a try.
I didn’t love it as much as others seem to. I really enjoyed the first hour or so where it’s mostly about just being a cat - exploring, leaping about and so on. No game has let me do that before and I was really liking it.

But then as it goes on it introduces combat and stealth sections, and I lost huge amounts of interest at those points - I’ve played a thousand combat and stealth games before and those elements felt completely unnecessary in Stray. It just felt to me like the developers had a great angle for a unique experience, but then couldn’t help but make it as ‘videogamey’ as they could.

I’d rate it 6/10, because I did like it enough to finish it, but it just didn’t hit the spot for me that it seems to have for others.
    I stopped once all the "people" showed up and the town.  I have no idea how far that is into the game, but it was after many puzzles.
I think it’s a good game. I was invested in the world and was keen to uncover the story. 

Probably 8-12 hrs?
I enjoyed it. Never finished it, got to a more action oriented part and I suck at that stuff so I moved on.
It’s a great wind down at night game.  It’s pretty short though.
Yeah it’s good and short.
It's a very good game, probably 10hrs top to finish it. I played it over a weekend, and got all of the achievements except one. There's an achievement for completing the gangs in 2hrs, which after playing it I almost tried because if you know where to go and what to do it seemed like a very manageable achievement to get. Just never tried to get it. If you can get it on sale for less than $20 totally worth it.
It’s not very good.  It’s Uncharted with a cat and the whole gameplay is just pressing X
I have 7h of playtime and finished it while a exploring a good bit but I very much enjoyed it and don’t feel like it was a waste of money.
I loved it. It’s a short game, but a fun and entertaining ride.
I wasn't a fan personally.  The gameplay is kinda cool and they absolutely *nailed* the expressiveness of the cats (my cats literally would not leave the TV alone the whole time I played, they thought *real* cats were in the TV).

There's some cool environmental puzzles, some cool collection stuff, a lot of meaningless missables.  But the story... absolutely killed the experience for me.  Without spoiling anything, the game was very much teased as a sort of cozy "cat adventure" in a futuristic cyberpunk world but the story focuses way less on the *cozy cat adventure* and almost entirely on hamfistedly jamming political views down your throat with a cyberpunk backdrop.

I wanted to have fun in a futuristic adventure world as a sharpy animated cat.  Instead I got about 10 hours of "DAE think late stage capitalism will inevitably lead to fascism and the apocalyptic downfall of humanity??? Isn't capitalism *horrible????  Guys???  Guys??? Hey did you know capitalism is bad????  Guys????"*

I fucking get it, I don't care and I dont need to be reminded every single dialogue, I just want to get this cat back to his friends :(

The ending is also >!painfully sad.  Fair warning.!<
    Cyberpunk game...political? No way. How is that possible. It's almost like the setting is inherently political.
        I knew someone was gonna say this...

Yes, while Cyberpunk *as a genre* leans into specific themes, it's not always as ham-fisted about it and it doesn't *have to*.  You wouldn't normally expect a game about a cat trying to get back to his friends to actually just be 10 hours of completely unapologetic political commentary that just happens to have a cat in the background, even if set in a "cyberpunk" setting.

By all means, I'll take my downvotes for not jerking off that particular horse like the rest of reddit loves to.
            [removed]
                Sounds a whole lot more like you're the one "offended" here.  Learn to have a civil conversation.

I'm a big fan of cyberpunk as a genre, and Stray very much felt like a bait and switch with what it was actually about.  But please, insult me some more for acknowledging that you can try to tell a story about something and *kind of do a shitty job at it*.
I liked the aesthetic and the "people" quite a bit. I'm not a cat person whatsoever and I enjoyed the one playthrough.
I lost interest after an hour and never went back. I think the game is less than 5 hours long.
If I remember correctly it's like 8 hours. It was pleasant, a vibe, and I liked the story and world. 


Definitely worth I'd say like 30.


Certainly a novel gaming experience. Basically AC with a cat.

I don't really understand the outsized vitriol the game got. It's a solid made game with a fun twist. Wish there were more like it. 

The only gripe I had was the rat popping light minigame in the first major level. Felt unnecessary. Just being a cat running around was way more fun than that kind of action filler bullshit used to make idiots feel like something is exciting when the setting itself is evocative enough.
I finished it in 22.4 hours, which is much less than I expect to get out of most games, but it was worth it.  For this type of game, I would compare it to the cost of going to a movie theatre.
I put 29.2 hours into it. But I think a good chunk of thst might have been sitting/sleeping in various spots. Or my kid just panning the camera around the cat and making it meow. Did I mention there’s a dedicated meow button?!?!
It’s a very fun unique game. If it’s cheap on sale I say get it.
I love cats. I have owned many cats. My gf and I have 2 cats.

This game was boring af 😂

Still love cats. They're better irl
It was cute and fun. The puzzles weren't terribly difficult but still enough to make you scratch your head.

It felt good to finish, wasn't a long game by any means, but there's lots of unwritten side stuff you can do and explore.

Doesn't need a sequel but did really show off the cat controls
It was a pleasant experience that wasn't expected. Played it on psplus but never fished it (kid preferred to use it as a cat petting simulator) but it looked and played great.
Holds a special place in my heart as the first game i played after an unexpected hospital stay and emergency surgery where i was away from my wife and home for 3 weeks. Sure we completed it in like 10 hours, but i loved every second
Fun game. Took about 10 hours. Good exploring,  graphics and environments. Meow button is cool.
It's a fantastic 10/10 game in my opinion. Great atmosphere, great story, fun gameplay. Only problem is, it's short. I have, I think 20 hours in it, over two playthroughs. Once as a blind playthrough, and once as a guided playthrough to find all the secrets and get all the achievements.

If you like cats, it's absolutely 100% worth it.
It’s more of an experience than a game. Only took me 5 hours to beat it playing casually and focusing on story
It was fun to play with my wife, who doesn't normally like to play games with me.

I would let her play until things got a little dicey, then she'd pass me the controller to get through it.
If you go into it with the expectation of playing a cat as it wanders through a cyberpunk city, what I recall it being advertised as, you’ll get that for the first third of the game. It shifts to become something different for the rest of the playtime however. If you approach it as a weird dystopian story from an outsider’s perspective, it’s not bad.
I think it was a short game, I wanna say 4-6 hours? That's if you do everything like collectibles and trophies. 

It's even more fun if you have a cat. I spent a good 15 minutes making the cat in the game meow and confusing the hell out of my real cat lol.
There's a Meow button.
I finished it twice
One of the best indie games Ive ever played
Not bad. I got a good 20 minutes out of it before I returned it.
It’s a cute game. The environments are interesting and fun to explore (there isn’t much exploration to be had but still cool to look around) and the gameplay, while very barebones feels great. I don’t know what fairly cheap is but for $20 or less it’s definitely worth playing
I loved it. Everybody knows it as the cat game but it's actually one of the best entries in the cyberpunk genre in recent years.
I was pretty bored but it was cute at times.
I got it on PlayStation plus, it’s a good game but I wouldn’t spend more than 25-30 on it
I was disappointed by how short it was. Didn't find the ending satisfying either
What did Google/YouTube say?
I found it to be boring
It's objectivley bad gameplay. 

The biggest pro is "cat" and it really doesn't offer much more then the feeling. But if you really love cats it's probably a good game.

I say that as a person who likes cats.
I couldn't finish it.  I found it very boring.
Gameworld made me ponder what had happened in the past. If you are into environmental storytelling, I personally think the gameworld was wonderfully crafted.
Length 👏 doesn’t 👏 dictate 👏 quality
The game has amazing world building, fun mechanics that don't overstay their welcome, a solid "show don't tell" storyline. I'd rate it a 10/10. It's short, but you get a lot out of it. One of my favourite gaming experiences of all time.
Very short. It’s an enjoyable game and one of the few to get the waterworks going but my platinum was about 6 hours.
It's short, but was a decent exploration experience.
i found it enjoyable, but there's very little replay value
It's fine. It was maybe 6-8 hours. I certainly wouldn't want it to be any longer.
I beat in 9 hours total. it's a good game, can't say I didn't enjoy it
I have 5.5 hours on steam in 1 playthrough with 50% of the achievements but I think I actually saw everything in those hours, I just didnt scratch the carpets or walls enough to get more achievements. I would only buy on sale though for like 20 bucks
where are you getting it cheap second hand?
    CeX (UK)
It was fun for a bit. I got really bored halfway through and by the time I wanted to play again it was removed from the free games.
Played about 4 hours of it. Was fun for a bit just chillin catting around being a cat but haven't gone back. Glad it was free though.
yeah, it's a pretty basic twist on a traditional point and click adventure game. Fun, you won't get more than a day or two out of it, and there isn't much replayability.
I really enjoyed it, but it is fairly short.  About 7-9 hours.  If you have a PlayStation, you can just get a month of ps plus and play it.
Mixed reviews? You gotta stop paying attention to whoever you're paying attention to then.
Around 7. I enjoyed it, cool atmosphere, nice story, beautiful environment. Made me cry like a baby.
Got like 16 hours for the plat. It's a delight.
To know the shortness, I would say that you can speedrun it in under 2 hours by just playing the game again. I'm honestly surprised more people don't have the speedrun achievement.

I really enjoyed it. I thought it was a laid back game, but it is visually beautiful
It's good, around 6.5 hours.
It’s honestly a good time. They really nailed the cyberpunk dystopia atmosphere. Story is pretty decent also. Not very long, you can finish in under 10 hours
It was enjoyable. I platinumed it mainly because it was easy to do so. I had fun. Got it for free on a monthly games deal but something I would pay over $20 for.
Play it and then Watch Creator.
Took my 9yo son 8.5 hours to beat it.
I personally liked it but I can see that it wouldn't be for everybody.
Loved it - felt different, had an engaging world design. The only thing I didn’t do was the speed run trophy. It was a bit annoying.
I think my first play through was about 8-10 hours. To get all the trophies was about 20-24 hours.
It’s fun but trying to get the trophies pissed me off.  Overall a cute game, nothing amazing though.
Played the story in 5 hours. Didn't get all side things collected so could probably push 2-4 hours more trying to get them
It's a very short game. Cute, but short. I actually don't like short games though. I liked it, but it was over way too early.
Pretty sure it’s on game pass and psplus
If you get the platinum, probably 10-12 hours. If you do one playthrough it’s only about 4-6 hours, depending on how much you explore the details. It’s a great deal if you find it on discount
I liked it, it’s very cozy and bittersweet
I enjoyed it. A good looking puzzle style game that is non stressful and has a story. I enjoyed it but I'm the "100 percent when I play discovery games" guy so I got around 20 hours out of it.
If you enjoy a nice post-apocalyptic world to explore, you'll like it. I think it's a really specific niche. LIke in Horizon Zero Dawn my favorite part was just trying to explore and find little clues about what happened to cause the apocalypse. I'm just a sucker for post-apocalyptic worlds.
I got like 8hours out of it. It's pretty fun but very short. I'd wait for a discount.
I turned it off after half an hour.
It's amazing and I love it but it's way too short. Maybe 10 hours.
I got 7 hours out of it. I had an absolute blast with it. Puzzles were fun, being a cat is amazing, and the gameplay is fun. 

I played it for “free” on Ps plus.
I got bored about 3 hours in, and I was really excited for it to come out
Once the charm of playing as a cat wears off, it’s pretty standard platformer fare. I got bored a few hours in and stopped.
It’s not super long, but it’s enjoyable. At a discounted $20 on Steam that is fair
It’s an excellent game. I’m not even a cat person and I still think that it’s the best PS5 game that I’ve played so far.
It's fun. A bit above average in my opinion, so it's "good" but not "amazing". Gameplay was solid and I had no noticeable bugs (PS5). The novelty of playing as a cat was definitely fun. 

I think I played through it in about 10 hours. I only went back for the easier trophies, but didn't 100% the game.
I've played 5.4 hours. I really enjoy the world and exploring it. I didn't much care for the action sequences. I still have it installed, but IDK if I'll get around to finishing it.
It's essentially a walking simulator with a cat. The gameplay itself is very basic platforming with some simple combat. About 10 hours of gameplay depending on how much you explore.

For $20 I think it is a fine game. I enjoyed the art style and the cyberpunk/android environment. One of the few walking games I enjoyed. If you watch trailers and it looks interesting you will probably like it.
I had loads of fun with it mostly because I like cats it's fairly short
great little game that knows exactly what it is and doesn’t overstay it’s welcome. i actually would agree with it winning indie GOTY, the atmosphere, world building, and aesthetic are all amazing
found it boring
it's fun, cute, and pretty. it's very short for the money, and pretty simple with some super minor puzzles. i think if you can get it for $10 or less it's worth it
It's good but perhaps not for everyone, some people may think it's boring if the don't feel the atmosphere.
I liked it a lot! I think I finished it in a few hours. Maybe around 6hrs I wanna say?
It’s for cozy gamers. My girlfriend loved it, as did her best friend. They spent a lot of time just knocking shit over as a cat.  In my opinion, it’s a perfect game, in that it delivered exactly what it advertised and did so very well.  If you didn’t like it, that’s perfectly fine. It means you weren’t the target audience.
It’s just okay in my opinion. Nothing special, yet I really enjoyed playing it. It’s not too long and I found it a really chill/relaxing game to play. Other than that nothing special like I said.
My cats love watching me play but I get bored easily.
Great exploration game, I think about 12 hours. If you like cats or dystopian future, it’s amazing
If starfield can be considered a horrible game, then I'd say that Stray is below that in it's barely even a game. It barely has any sort of player input and you could change the whole cat aspect of it that isn't required by the setting and then what are you left with?

A linear exploration game.

It was somewhat fun uncovering the world and the perspective was cool, but I've played similar in a different where you transform into a smaller creature that's needed to get through puzzle/exploration areas but it had the added bonus of having combat.
It‘s an ok game, carried by graphics and the fact that you play as a cat.
It's relatively short, but it's fantastic...

I'd rank the experience higher than a handful of longer more "mainstream" AAA games easily...
It's cute, it's interesting, and meowing at security cameras who nod back never got old.

But it's short. I usually take a *really* long time finishing games, and I completed this one pretty fast. If you can get it for cheap, I'd say go for it - it's more fun than a drink at Starbucks (or even 3).
It's s lovely game, but GOTY candidate was a stretch.
Is it a good game? No

Does it have a cat in it? Yes so it’s 10/10
It was a great game for me and my wife to relax and play over a few hours together. It was fun, quirky and different to other stuff. Definitely worth playing.
Stray is most definitely a game. I can assure you, with a 100% guarantee, that it is one of the games I've played.
It’s a great game. It’s creative, fun and endearing. I spent 13 hours on it as a completionist. I did everything in-game and all but 2 hidden PS achievements. There is a varying degree of difficulty in the puzzles. I liked the storyline and if you love cats, it’s even better.
I loved it. If you don't want something too heavy and with simply game play, Stray is the go to.  It's kinda therapeutic.
Think this would be a great candidate for a switch port
It's a walking simulator with some very light puzzle elements and a few opportunities for very basic combat.

The atmosphere is cool. The NPC's you don't really develop a connection with. 

It's just....ok. If you like cats or have someone just getting into gaming, it's probably going to be worth it. 

If you are expecting a deep narrative experience with a rich story or riveting gameplay, that's not this game.
It's a walking simulator but you're a cat.
It's fine, it should not have won best indie last year lmao
I got maybe 5 hours, and then stopped playing.

Wasn’t bad, wasn’t great. It was available on PS plus extra, and I felt like there were other games I’d rather play more than it.

I’m sure it’s worth playing for cat people.
It's a good game that is overrated. While I love cats, I played almost 10h and I was bored most of the time.
Stray is a great game. 7-8 hours long or so. Deserving of a GOTY nomination to recognize its originality. Jealous you’re playing it for the first time!
It’s not spectacular or anything, but it’s still enjoyable.
i suggest watching rantons review about that game
It's a charming indie game with lovable characters and an atmospheric world.  However, not a terribly lot going on in terms of gameplay or challenge. It's pretty "on the rails" as a game, with just a few explorable hubs.
It was a cute, moderately fun game to explore. Pretty short, maybe 10 hours max, I beat it in maybe 6 or 7 hours doing some of the extra stuff but not a ton. It was fine, not super memorable, but if the idea of hopping around as a cat and talking to robots sounds like fun, it's worth a shot.

I mostly got a lot out of it because my dog was obsessed with it. Every meow had him staring at the TV, fully engrossed.
If you like cats you’ll like this game. I loved it. Short and sweet, interesting concept, and the ending made me teary eyed. I’d give it a go!

Edit: Also has a banger soundtrack
its okay for an idie game
I really enjoyed it, characters all had a nice charm too. If you like adventure games that aren't challenging, it's great.
I got bored about halfway through it and never finished it.
It's a good story wrapped around an okay game. It's also made being a cat feel very cat-like. Like you just want to get up high and knock shit off shelves and damn that's satisfying.

IMO it was worth the $30 price tag it originally had, so if you can get it on sale, even better. I'm gonna say 6 hours start to finish, but I'm not certain. I played with my kid so we spent a lot of time goofing around.
I love it, but be aware that there isn't much in the way of skill-driven gameplay, and not much replicability either. It's more about experiencing a charming and interesting world. I absolutely recommend it, but it's not the kind of game you should count the hours on.
I hit that meow button so many times
You have to go in knowing that most of the game is exploring as a cat.  That's it.
Meow... 🙂‍↔️
6 hour little point and click adventure game. Gameplay design is fairly simple but there's good variety, so it feels fresh the whole runtime. 

If you do not find the idea of embodying a literal house cat to explore and play interesting, you probably will not like it. It is very much about the central gimmick of being a cat.
stray is even better knowing that that one crazy pirate Empress girl went batshit over it in her message
I loved the game for the introductory missions and just being a cat. Once the actual game started it got real old real quick.
It's about 10 hours. 

It's a simple but very atmospheric and unique game. I enjoyed it thoroughly and pre-ordered the physical copy for ps5 for 30 dollars and didn't regret it. But I was very excited for it and enjoy those types of games to their fullest extent. I can't say I've played much that's *quite* like it. But I also like to take my time with some games. The story is, like the game, short, but also like the game, interesting. There's a small collectible component in one of the initial areas and some fun little achievements.

Given the length, I'd say it's worth 15 for quality. Otherwise wait for a sale for it to be 15-10.
Playing it at the moment and loving it. Isn't super long and you basically just jump around a cyberpunk city (small areas) as a cat. But the visuals are lit soundtrack is bangin and it's relaxing as fuck.
https://howlongtobeat.com/game/79790
Stray was my 2022 GOTY and made my personal top 50 games of all time list.  It doesn't hit for everyone, but when it hits, it *really* hits.  It's well worth the price tag, and it's eight to ten hours long.
I loved it, but I'm a major cat guy. I have 4 of them. So walking around as a cat exploring and solving basic puzzles was awesome.
I'm really glad I played it. It isn't the longest game (I have 10 hours on it), but it was an enjoyable one.
About 7 hours or more. I spent most of my time admiring the attention to details. The graphics are good and u don't need a tutorial to play it. Just know your key bindings and explore. Solve mysteries and exploration, that's the game
Enjoyable. It’s a 6-8hour game. It is a fairly simple game but looks great, has some decent enough puzzle aspects and is something a little different.
Its not just a good game; its a 10-15 hour work of art, in my opinion.
I was bored with it within the first couple hours.
Good experience, and it was around 5 hours for me and I was playing extremely slow.
Just play it, don't be a pussy
I got probably 15 hours out of it because I went for all of the trophies. It isn't a huge game but it is an interesting story and it is remarkably fun jumping around as a cat.
It's just long enough to be ineligible for a refund.
Don't pay more than like $20 for it, but it's absolutely worth playing. For what it's worth, I got it when it was free on PS5, loved it enough that I ended up buying it on Steam
Being a cute cat is fun, but the "combat" is rough. After several hours against the first enemies, I had to put it down
It’s a fun game. Not crazy difficult and relatively short. But it’s cool and has a dope style. Cyberpunk? Retrofuturism? Idk something inbetween those. If you can get it cheap go for it
I love cats , so yes for me
It's very short but it's a beautiful experience imo. Slightly biased as I'ma big lover of cats but it's full of charm and really captures the 'cat' experience.
Stray was really fun.
I loved it, but I also lost my 19yr old cat at the time so it really helped me at the time. I'd still recommend it, it's unique if nothing else.
I adored it. I spent maybe 8 hours on it but I’m not hugely experienced with this style of game so it took a minute for me to catch on to the objectives. If you like the cutesy idea of being a cat and listening to robot music for 8 hrs, then it’s def a good game. Not everyone’s cup of tea!
It’s a good game, and one that’s relaxing and chill. It’s not intense or frustrating. Just a nice kickback game.
Are there any sad moments?
    Intro and ending
It's fun. There are some moments that are a bit annoying, but it's fun. One of the main issues is how short it is
It's a great game. Got about 8hrs out of it. Mostly quiet platforming and world exploring and finding out the story through lore, punctuated by frenetic running away at moments. If you love cats you will love the game. Really moody and atmospheric, responsive controls. Loved it and definitely worth it if on sale.

The cat has a lot of character.
6
I loved the art and the story. I think I completed it in about 6.5 hours but I think it was definitely worth it.
It's a pretty chill, charming and easy game. If you want more, you may be disappointed. It is a good game for what it is trying to do. Playtime is probably around 6-10 hours.
Its nice fun little game that lasts probably around 10 hours.

Bonus: if you have a cat irl you can watch it circle around the tv confused about the cat talking on screen ;P
Personally, I think it’s ok.   

It’s a standard platformer with the main selling point being you are playing a cat and it’s atmospheric storytelling. The graphics are quite beautiful and the story is ok.   

It’s not a bad game, especially for indie standards but I didn’t understand the hype of why it got nominated for GotY. There is no DLC so getting it second hand won’t result in you “missing out” and it is a pretty easy plat if you are a trophy hunter. It’s a pretty glitch free and ok experience but got a lot of underserved hype because cat game imo.
It is an inexpensive games with a mix of both positive reviews and negative reviews among the community. I believe you are on the right path to finding out the answer. Good luck
Worth a 10 note no more
Platinumed it on ps5. Got it for free when it released.  

I played through a few times with my kids probably got about 12hrs out of it.
I think it's cos it might have gotten more hype than it really needed or deserved tbh. It's just the 'cat game'. But that year the hype and novelty of ''the cat game'' meant it was talked about in the same vein as GoW Ragnarok and Elden Ring so many people were probably disappointed
The best about the game: music, lighting, environments/levels, story
The worst about the game: often clunky contextual controls for jumping
Overall: great package, sweet story and definitely a game to remember
I loved it, one of my favorite games on PS5 and the graphics and art are fantastic
I thought it was phenomenal. Then again I don’t have much time to spend on video games but I personally liked it. Don’t know how much time I’ve put into it but pretty long
Yes. It's simple and enjoyable. I'd describe it as a quirky eye candy game. I played it with my Wife, we loved it. It's more of an experience and less of a hardcore gaming thing.
Story and mechanics are straight forward. Can finish it during daylight. That said, game is good. You can feel the atmosphere it sets.
I loved it. Wasn’t particularly fan of the first hour because I didn’t get the mood the game was going for. Then all of a sudden I felt very cosy playing this game and was actually sad when I got it over with. Definitely in my top 3 games played this year

It lasted 8h for me. You could probably get around 12h tops if you go for the platinum
Bought it and never played it
It's amazing. If you like cats that is. It's very good in letting you do cat things. 8-10 hours one playthrough. Max 20h platinum trophy. Totally worth it considering it's free or cheap. Had more actual 'fun'/entertainment than with Elden Ring, which I had played right before.
Not my style, so I did not enjoy. At first it seem unique, but when I entered the "large maze" - I gave up. Walked around for prob an hour until I gave up and had no idea where to go. Total playtime prob 2-3 hours of mine.
Well, beside playing a cute cat, it's a real basic exploration game with nothing more to do than wandering.
8.4 hours according to steam.  was a fun little game, def worth a try
Not much of a spoiler so just gonna say that you can idle in the game and I wish I could use the game as a screensaver sometimes to just hang out with a cat
6 or 7. It’s charming and has memorable visuals, but not much in a way of engaging gameplay or replayability.
It’s not complicated. It’s not hard. But it sticks to you. And like some other post-apocalyptic pieces, there’s a real emotional sticking point to the retrospectives on contemporary times. I found it very worth the price of my subscription but I wouldn’t buy it. And certainly not at full price.
It’s *solid*, but not particularly challenging or even really very engaging. It has everything a game needs, so to speak, and it’s real cute and well-crafted, but once you finish it you just feel a bit empty and disappointed. A lot of “is this it?”

But if it’s cheap, by all means buy it. It’s not a bad game at all, it’s just… not *a lot* of game. It’s a nice starter, not a main course.
It’s short but really fun and relaxing. Would never play it again but I’m glad I went through it once
I played through it once, I had a lot of fun. There is an achievement for completing it in under 2 hours, which I’d imagine is a targeted speed run, but it should give you an idea. Fun game, worth £20 or so.
I had fun with it, but it is very short
Boring af. 

Interesting world, boring gameplay. in only got praise cause people like to play as a cat..

A solid 4 or 5/10
It is a walking simulator but as a cat. Got some light puzzles and combat. Kinda liked it more than I guessed.
I found it fun but I got stuck at the end and haven't finished it yet
Ita a good game with a good story but it's short.  You can rush through it without exploring in 2-3 hours but if you look for memories, explore and do little side quests you would probably be looking at around 10 hours.

It's certainly worth playing at least once.
It's fun! It has an interesting story. You get to play as a cat too which it doesn't happen often. Definitely worth playing it
I think I played it for 5 hours? One regular playthrough and then another speedrun to clean up the leftover achievements. I enjoyed it both times, but I don’t think I’ll go back to it. Kinda done everything there is to do. Although I have a friend who’s done probably about 30 playthroughs, mainly trying to improve his PB, but he also downloads mods inbetween playthroughs to shake things up a bit.
From what I understand, it's more of an artwork than a game. Not much replay value or unique gameplay, but it has a pretty art style.
Just played for a few hours. Thought it was kind of boring and hoped for more interactions.
It was decent - can probably get 2 playthroughs out of it with the 2nd one on the highest difficulty or the trophy speedrun.

Was refreshing in how it was an original idea at the time.
i quite liked it, its realy coosy but its only around 5-6hours playtime.
I didn’t get too far before becoming bored and giving up but I wouldn’t say that makes it a bad game. The gameplay and graphics are great if you like that kind of game.
I got the platinum trophy which is rare for me to try and do. It took around ten hours. The game is pretty simple but really charming. The short length also works in the games favor. It always moves things along before a section gets boring. 

I get why some people who paid $40 were disappointed with the length. If it's on sale for like $20 that seems more than reasonable to me though.
Stray is a game targeting people who love cats. 

If you aren't into cats, it's probably going to be an okay game, done in about 20 hours.

If you love cats, you'll spend those 20 hours just scratching up the couch, all while meowing, simply because you can.

I'm a cat lover, so for me, Stray hit all the right paws, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who isn't a fan of cats.
It was ok, what was there was well done but not enough to it for me.
It's fun, it's creative. But it's also very short.

[https://howlongtobeat.com/game/79790](https://howlongtobeat.com/game/79790)

I wouldn't pay over $20 for it.
It is enjoyable. Not too long. It runs well on the Steam Deck.
Just a simple arcade runner, nothing more.
Though its not for me, my wife loved it. She is a cat lady who mostly enjoys retro adventure games.

Wasnt me, so i'm not sure on the hours of gameplay
I enjoyed the heck out of it. Got more then 10 hr, prob 15-20 but I play slow and flip a lot of stones. It wont be for everyone, its more about the story and setting then the action. Its kind of an interactive Miyazaki movie.
It didn't do much for me. The novelty wore off after about an hour for me.
It's about $34.99 worth of game
It's successful at what it sets out to do. If you can get it cheap and want to play Cute Cat Game then get it.
It was a nice experience, but I can’t see myself replaying it. The story was okay, but I wasn’t really into it
It's fun if you like cats. Don't expect too much from it. Running through robot legs and making them fall like nerds is still fun though.
Yes you play as a cat
I played it for a bit but lost interest for other games.Just like Baldur's Gate 3.But that one is another bag of cats(don't like the combat system,no hot chicks characters to play,etc).I was planning in resuming playing it but like i said.There was so many other games that were more interesting for me.
Will Check this one
I really like this game, took probably 10-15 hours to finish. However it’s a zero 0% replayability  factor for me. Definitely a one and done.
No, got bored after reaching second area and quit playing. Controls are clunky and the game is super easy.
Depends on how you play. It's an experience, an adventure with amazing atmosphere and storytelling. Take your time and you'll enjoy it.
It's peaceful if you want that type of game. I enjoyed but didn't complete.
It's nothing special, but it's not bad. It's just a very generic game
Okay yes the time span of the game sucks!!! I wish it was longer however the game is extremely detailed in my opinion and has so many features that bring the game together all together it's an awesome experience to play also emotional for some
This is exactly it. I see some folks deride it as a shit game. Its definitely not shit, but I wouldn't call it great. I'm a cat person and I fucking love cats, but the people who called for it to be a GOTY were huffing the litterbox dust. It definitely has charm to it, and it's worth checking out on sale, but it's nothing that's gonna be remembered by gamers as a whole in a few years.
    When the cat gets the backpack though...
    I disagree in that its the best game ever made for RPing as a cat. 

Not that it has any competition 😅
        A Street Cat's Tale. You straight-up roleplay a cat's daily life. What I didn't expect was how easy it is to, er, "fail." I was expecting more of a cute RPG and less cat survival RPG.
            "Bury your poop before a predator finds it! You have 3 seconds!"
        Little Kitty Big City
            Itty Bitty Kitty City
        Cattails!
            Catrails works as well, yknow since the cats jumping is kinda on rails
        The Mithra race in FFXI and FFXIV would like a word...

If you're into MMOs and wanna play a cat girl, well, there you go. :)
            That's not playing as a cat. It's just being a weeb. It's still fun, but the wrong idea for this
        Cat Quest

Edit, The purring quest also, I liked that one
        But Khajit has wares if you have coin!
        Borgo the Cat
    I think some folks call it ‘shit’ because their expectations were way off from reality. They were expecting a full open-world Cyberpunk with cats from a studio with a couple dozen developers. Wasn’t gonna happen. But with expectations in check, it’s a great little game. 

I do agree though, absolutely not GOTY material, but again, it wasn’t supposed to be. It’s fine for what it was - a cute little story about a lost cat in a ‘cyber’-style world.
        I mean, even if all you were expecting was actual platforming, you'll be disappointed. It's cute, but it has little gameplay - a few puzzles and a little bit of blob dodging.
    Haven’t played the game but it did seem like the game earned its GOTY *nomination*. It definitely wasn’t GOTY but seems like it was an excellently executed game. I currently have it on my wishlist on my Series X, just waiting for a good sale on it.
        I don't think there's really enough *game* there to even nominate it for GOTY, honestly. It's a very well executed little oddity, but (even though I freaking love cats) imo there are many games that have done the 'limited gameplay to tell an immersive story' genre far better. But those games don't have the novelty or name recognition of Stray, so they're overlooked while this one is overexposed.
            I mean people in this thread are being harsh on Stray for limited gameplay but surely Stray’s more complex and longer than something like Limbo, which many people had the same fondness for when it came out.  Some of us are just fine with taking a certain amount of style as a substitute for substance.  A short game with low interactivity but a lot of cinematic beauty isn’t automatically bad.
                I think you're deliberately missing my point. I said myself that Stray executes its concept well. I figured the implication was obvious but in case you missed it, *I like Stray and I think it's a good game*. I just don't think it's an *amazing* game. Regardless of the genre or scope, that ought to be the bar for a GOTY nomination, right?

>Some of us are just fine with taking a certain amount of style as a substitute for substance.

Again, I think you're mixing up meanings here. There's a difference between a game with low interactivity and a game with little substance.

I love games that function as storytelling devices rather than highly interactive gaming mechanisms. I simply think there are better examples of the genre than Stray. 

>A short game with low interactivity but a lot of cinematic beauty isn’t automatically bad.

I agree. But once again, I did not claim Stray was bad, merely that I think the scope of its ambition is stretched a little thin by the relatively bland gameplay. I'd rather it committed one way or the other.
                    It wasn’t that deep man I just disagree.
                        Don't do that. Don't write out a response but then when I bother to take the time to address what you said, act like you didn't actually care anyway. Why are you commenting on a discussion thread if not to have a discussion?
    I just don't call it a game because it isn't.
    its also a gorgeous game too
    But goats, they will be remembered.
    It'll be remembered. Not because of it's actual gameplay, but still remembered.
    People calling it to be GOTY were mostly trying the rile up  Elden Ring fans, which generally worked.
What kinda car?
    I wanna say Honda Civic, but I am not a car guy. Can anyone confirm?
        It’s definitely high purrrformance whatever it is.
        Slaps hood this baby can fit so many hours in it
        [removed]
            Good taste.
            I'd hope most people would understand than six great hours is better than forty mediocre hours.  


3 hours of Shawshank redemption is better than 100 hours of QVC on loop.
        A car you can trust!
            Never mind the car, let's talk about the henge
                What henge is that again?
        Nah it's a Mercury Cougar
    I feel bad that you’re getting downvoted because you happened to post that reply _just_ before you saw that I’d edited my original comment…
        Do the right thing, edit it back to car.
        This is why I always add this bit to the bottom of an edited comment

"Edit: cat, not car"

    Orange
Even though I have to say I didn't *feel* like a cat. Click X to jump here. And then click X to jump there. Those prompts really killed the immersion of swift and sneaky cat movement for me.

But world building and press key to meow were good!
    You can run around holding the jump button to make the transitions more seamless.
        True, but it's still not "free" movement. I would have wished for 100 % control over where to jump and crawl and explore.
            But then it wouldn't jump like a cat? I'm confused. Cat jumps are point A to point B in a very brief instant just like the game did, which is why it was restricted that way. I'm sure you don't mean it should jump like Mario but maybe you're thinking of Little Kitty Big City, where the jump has more freedom but is more floaty which kills some realism. Stray has more realistic environment so it would be jarring if the cat jumped like that.  
  
Cat is small enough to go under cars and if it crawled they'd have to add invisible walls because cats can virtually crawl anywhere. They let you explore roofs? I thought the cat feel was the thing they nailed compared to the rest
    You can also turn off the prompts in the settings. Still no free jumping but it’s less immersion breaking if you need it.
Isn’t it also on game pass?
    It used to be on PS plus extra or premium, whichever one is basically Sony’s game pass. That may be what you’re thinking. Not sure if it is anymore however.
        yea thats what i was thinking
    No
Ten hours? It's barely two for a full blind playthrough and about three maybe four to get 100% if you are slow.
10 hours is a huge stretch, unless you're going to go for all achievements including a 2-hour speedrun.
I took my time and played it calmly, still only took me 6 hours from start to finish.
I have played and my opinion:

 - Story and atmosphere are really good (8.5/10)
 - Gameplay is okay (6/10)

The novelty of you being a cat is fun, but not for very long. The "parkour" is pretty railroaded, making it very easy and the opposite of frustrating (I personally see this as a plus).

Some puzzles are a bit tough to figure out, not because they're very hard, but because it's not always obvious what you need to do and the solution might require you to do something seemingly unrelated. Very little subtle hints as well.

Also a relatively short game, but honestly the perfect length. Any longer and it would have dragged on and have become boring.

Definitely experience the game as an exploration game. Just walk around, get a feel for the levels and atmosphere, talk to everyone and gather as much information as possible. Don't attempt to just rush the storyline.
Do you think a 7 year old would be able to play? We just got a PS5 for the family, and my 7yo daughter is feeling left out.
    I'm sure they'd love it, but you might need to help them out in some of the trickier bits.
        When I was 7 and got stuck in a game I would just play the beginning over and over again. And I would like it. Kids these days have it so easy...
            Ugh the Tomb Raider game Undersea or w/e that one was, I dropped it at the start cuz it was too hard for my yet undeveloped brain
                When I played Tomb Raider as a kid, I just ran around her house while that creepy old butler followed me. The main game was too difficult.
                    Woah flashbacks
                Men in Black ps1 flashbacks....never did the 1st building jump just kept falling
                Underworld. I wanna play it again but damn those giant spideys keep me away lol
            I remember just playing the hercules demo that came with my ps1 like 3000x.
            Yeah tutorials were amazing.
            I absolutely LOVED Majoras Mask as a kid but i swear I never got past like the second temple of the game. I think the bull was the furthest i got as a kid. I feel like i spent majority of the time just getting to the first skull kid fight on the final day .

I dont think ive ever completed a mario game. I dont think i finished Donkey Kong country until i was an adult getting into retro games.

Subzero Mythologies I never got past level 2 without cheat codes. I think i just replayed the first level over and over until i was over the game 


Theres something about just being entertained as a kid with games. Didnt have to jump through so many hoops for it to be a good game. You just had fun
        Ehh all the jumping just takes a hit off the bottom. No g real skill needed.
            The Zurk level can be challenging because you have to be fast (and is also a bit creepy for a 7 year old). The stealth levels are better but depending on the skill level they might be a bit tricky.

Keep in mind kids are usually way less coordinated than adults.
    💯.  It was the first game my 5yo nephew played (kinda) well without frustration. 

Altho they can sometimes get stuck in an area n u might need to help them out. 

Also some areas can be a bit creepy so there's that to consider. Nothing hectic though
    Check out untitled goose game.  That's a riot for kids
    Totally, very simple and linear. nothing super intense. Very hand holdy but the charm is in the exploration anyways
    The cute little Astro game that comes with the PS5 is GREAT for teaching about the controller and a basic rudimentary way games work.
        Thanks for the recommendation! Didn't realize that was a playable game, thought it was just a basic tutorial. Both my kids are loving it.
    Yeah it’s not too bad. There are enemies, but you mostly just run from them, and they’re only in a few spots. Mostly just puzzles, exploration, and vibing.
    Yeah I think she would be able to as long as she doesn’t have a tendency to get too frustrated if she has to retry certain parts multiple times. All the jumping is automatic with one button press so you can’t really mess that up. Some of the enemy encounters are challenging and the exploration to find all the collectibles and do the side quests could be difficult as well.
    Yes. There are some chase scenes that might be a bit much so be ready to step in.

Also there's a bambi opening so prep to tell them it'll all turn out fine.
    There’s some robots that can shoot lasers or something at you. Some weird blobs that chase you. So could be scary but depends on the kid
    My 5 year old loves it. There are a lot of good kids out there. Just find what she likes and look for games similar to her interests.
    my 10 year old loved it very much.
Yep, I played it this time last year in the week between Christmas and New years eve. Horrible weather outside and ate good holiday food. 10/10 comfy as fook.
    Exactly how I played too. 10/10
Tbh I feel like a 120hr game will inevitably have a lot of repeated actions, there's more change you'll drop it. Short games are much better in this regards
    What games are 120 hours?
        Persona 5
            This is precisely the game I meant. I was so tired of ludicrous farming same types of mobs that act the same I quit the game just before the final boss.
                When do you ever need to farm or grind in persona?
        Honestly like a fuckload of games but it’s not always quality
        Every mmo, a large portion of rpgs, any sandbox, any rogue like and lite.
        The persona games are crazy long. Dragon quest 11 also took me 100+ hours to 100%.
        Elden Ring took me about 140h to complete for the first time

Witcher 3, about 150h

Baldur's Gate 3, about 120h

Shadow of War, a bit over 100h

...the list goes on, but there's a couple that I can remember.

---

Online / live service games are obviously also up there (I literally have 30 000h in WoW), but I guess you're asking about singleplayer games.
        Games wtih good game mechanics (repeated actions are so fun that you don't mind pressing the same button for 100 hours) like Elden Ring (both visual and mechanical fun) or Enter the Gungeon (repetition is literally the game).
        Lots of games can have 120 hours of content. Or rather, there's games where you can (reasonably) sink 120 hours in.

Like ones with a lot of replayability. RPGs with lots of sidequests. MMOs/live service games. Fighting games.

(There's some overlap in those)
        I'd say oblivion, Skyrim, and Factorio, but those games are at *least* 200 hours.
        The Witcher 3 + DLC's
They were separate, somewhat unrelated questions, but agree with your sentiment.
I feel the same about Journey
    So you're saying it's not about the Destiny, but the Journey?
Exactly how I feel about Edith Finch
Fire Watch is an awesome game!
Although I agree there is a limit to this. I can enjoy a 6  to 10 hour well crafted linear game for sure with good replay value but stray is barely 2 hours with no gameplay or replay value at all to speak of and the one mechanic it has is clunk and poorly handled.
    2 hours? Did you play it? Were you rushing?
It's a game that should be savored and played as a cat.
        There's literally an achievement to beat the game in under 2 hours. Casually it will take longer but it's not a long game if you play semi efficiently
    Stray is eight to ten hours long on a blind playthrough.  Are you sure you're not thinking of the speedrun?  Or another game entirely?
        8 to 10 hours is gigantic stretch. The game is not 2 hours like that other guy said but it's about 5h at most, if you take it slowly. You'd have to play the game twice and get all the trophies to get to 10 hours.
Honestly the story was deeper and more emotional than I expected going in, I thought it would just be a cyberpunky cat simulator but I was pleasantly surprised!
Well it was nominated for GOTY at the Geoff Awards
    Every awards show is bullshit
It got hate? It seemed to me like it was very well loved.
    yeah there was some hate initially, because it was a cat game. People were like “you’re a cat wow so innovative” etc etc
        I don't think that's why there was hate (it was a while ago so maybe I forget). The problem was that it had so much hype surrounding it: the reveal trailer was one of the most interesting I've seen for ages, with such amazing atmosphere and tone. Combine that with Internet cat frenzy, some of the news that came out about how they'd been working on it for quite a while and spent a lot of time trying to replicate realistic cat movement, everyone's imagination went wild on a hugely innovative game.

The atmosphere and tone in the game itself is great, and the story behind it pretty cool, but the game behind it is very simple. Movement and platforming was fairly simplistic and there isn't much to it beyond following the story and the cool world they created. This was reflected in its price, and is clearly all it was ever really meant to be, but expectations are guided by hopes and dreams sometimes.

I thought it was a fun game. Great atmosphere and a nice story, chill to play.
        I think making a game where you play as a cat is innovative lol never understood the sarcasm sentiment behind those statements
            I could definitely understand it being a gimmick but they put a lot of effort into making a cat protagonist be a core mechanic to the game that it felt innovative. It was a pretty well made simulator.
I don't know what you consider ps5 exclusive because Stray was available on PS4 too from day one.    
Agreed that it wouldn't get that much attention if not the circumstances, but it was more about good release date and hype because of cats
Most games are
Also the story feels incomplete, near the end you would expect to at least see certain characters that showed up at the beginning of the game but it never happens
Exactly. I just started it last night, and you couldn't be more correct. It's a pretty weak platformer, and there's very little to interact with so far anyway.
The first question was about quality. The second about quantity.
I stopped once all the "people" showed up and the town.  I have no idea how far that is into the game, but it was after many puzzles.
Cyberpunk game...political? No way. How is that possible. It's almost like the setting is inherently political.
    I knew someone was gonna say this...

Yes, while Cyberpunk *as a genre* leans into specific themes, it's not always as ham-fisted about it and it doesn't *have to*.  You wouldn't normally expect a game about a cat trying to get back to his friends to actually just be 10 hours of completely unapologetic political commentary that just happens to have a cat in the background, even if set in a "cyberpunk" setting.

By all means, I'll take my downvotes for not jerking off that particular horse like the rest of reddit loves to.
        [removed]
            Sounds a whole lot more like you're the one "offended" here.  Learn to have a civil conversation.

I'm a big fan of cyberpunk as a genre, and Stray very much felt like a bait and switch with what it was actually about.  But please, insult me some more for acknowledging that you can try to tell a story about something and *kind of do a shitty job at it*.

>Some of us are just fine with taking a certain amount of style as a substitute for substance.

Again, I think you're mixing up meanings here. There's a difference between a game with low interactivity and a game with little substance.

I love games that function as storytelling devices rather than highly interactive gaming mechanisms. I simply think there are better examples of the genre than Stray. 

>A short game with low interactivity but a lot of cinematic beauty isn’t automatically bad.

I agree. But once again, I did not claim Stray was bad, merely that I think the scope of its ambition is stretched a little thin by the relatively bland gameplay. I'd rather it committed one way or the other.
                It wasn’t that deep man I just disagree.
                    Don't do that. Don't write out a response but then when I bother to take the time to address what you said, act like you didn't actually care anyway. Why are you commenting on a discussion thread if not to have a discussion?
I just don't call it a game because it isn't.
its also a gorgeous game too
But goats, they will be remembered.
It'll be remembered. Not because of it's actual gameplay, but still remembered.
People calling it to be GOTY were mostly trying the rile up  Elden Ring fans, which generally worked.
I wanna say Honda Civic, but I am not a car guy. Can anyone confirm?
    It’s definitely high purrrformance whatever it is.

3 hours of Shawshank redemption is better than 100 hours of QVC on loop.
    A car you can trust!
        Never mind the car, let's talk about the henge
            What henge is that again?
    Nah it's a Mercury Cougar
I feel bad that you’re getting downvoted because you happened to post that reply _just_ before you saw that I’d edited my original comment…
    Do the right thing, edit it back to car.
    This is why I always add this bit to the bottom of an edited comment

"Edit: cat, not car"

You can run around holding the jump button to make the transitions more seamless.
    True, but it's still not "free" movement. I would have wished for 100 % control over where to jump and crawl and explore.
        But then it wouldn't jump like a cat? I'm confused. Cat jumps are point A to point B in a very brief instant just like the game did, which is why it was restricted that way. I'm sure you don't mean it should jump like Mario but maybe you're thinking of Little Kitty Big City, where the jump has more freedom but is more floaty which kills some realism. Stray has more realistic environment so it would be jarring if the cat jumped like that.  
  
Cat is small enough to go under cars and if it crawled they'd have to add invisible walls because cats can virtually crawl anywhere. They let you explore roofs? I thought the cat feel was the thing they nailed compared to the rest
You can also turn off the prompts in the settings. Still no free jumping but it’s less immersion breaking if you need it.
It used to be on PS plus extra or premium, whichever one is basically Sony’s game pass. That may be what you’re thinking. Not sure if it is anymore however.
    yea thats what i was thinking
No
I'm sure they'd love it, but you might need to help them out in some of the trickier bits.
    When I was 7 and got stuck in a game I would just play the beginning over and over again. And I would like it. Kids these days have it so easy...
        Ugh the Tomb Raider game Undersea or w/e that one was, I dropped it at the start cuz it was too hard for my yet undeveloped brain
            When I played Tomb Raider as a kid, I just ran around her house while that creepy old butler followed me. The main game was too difficult.
                Woah flashbacks
            Men in Black ps1 flashbacks....never did the 1st building jump just kept falling
            Underworld. I wanna play it again but damn those giant spideys keep me away lol
        I remember just playing the hercules demo that came with my ps1 like 3000x.
        Yeah tutorials were amazing.
        I absolutely LOVED Majoras Mask as a kid but i swear I never got past like the second temple of the game. I think the bull was the furthest i got as a kid. I feel like i spent majority of the time just getting to the first skull kid fight on the final day .

I dont think ive ever completed a mario game. I dont think i finished Donkey Kong country until i was an adult getting into retro games.

Subzero Mythologies I never got past level 2 without cheat codes. I think i just replayed the first level over and over until i was over the game 


Theres something about just being entertained as a kid with games. Didnt have to jump through so many hoops for it to be a good game. You just had fun
    Ehh all the jumping just takes a hit off the bottom. No g real skill needed.
        The Zurk level can be challenging because you have to be fast (and is also a bit creepy for a 7 year old). The stealth levels are better but depending on the skill level they might be a bit tricky.

Keep in mind kids are usually way less coordinated than adults.
💯.  It was the first game my 5yo nephew played (kinda) well without frustration. 

Altho they can sometimes get stuck in an area n u might need to help them out. 

Also some areas can be a bit creepy so there's that to consider. Nothing hectic though
Check out untitled goose game.  That's a riot for kids
Totally, very simple and linear. nothing super intense. Very hand holdy but the charm is in the exploration anyways
The cute little Astro game that comes with the PS5 is GREAT for teaching about the controller and a basic rudimentary way games work.
    Thanks for the recommendation! Didn't realize that was a playable game, thought it was just a basic tutorial. Both my kids are loving it.
Yeah it’s not too bad. There are enemies, but you mostly just run from them, and they’re only in a few spots. Mostly just puzzles, exploration, and vibing.
Yeah I think she would be able to as long as she doesn’t have a tendency to get too frustrated if she has to retry certain parts multiple times. All the jumping is automatic with one button press so you can’t really mess that up. Some of the enemy encounters are challenging and the exploration to find all the collectibles and do the side quests could be difficult as well.
Yes. There are some chase scenes that might be a bit much so be ready to step in.

Also there's a bambi opening so prep to tell them it'll all turn out fine.
There’s some robots that can shoot lasers or something at you. Some weird blobs that chase you. So could be scary but depends on the kid
My 5 year old loves it. There are a lot of good kids out there. Just find what she likes and look for games similar to her interests.
my 10 year old loved it very much.
Exactly how I played too. 10/10
What games are 120 hours?
    Persona 5
        This is precisely the game I meant. I was so tired of ludicrous farming same types of mobs that act the same I quit the game just before the final boss.
            When do you ever need to farm or grind in persona?
    Honestly like a fuckload of games but it’s not always quality
    Every mmo, a large portion of rpgs, any sandbox, any rogue like and lite.
    The persona games are crazy long. Dragon quest 11 also took me 100+ hours to 100%.
    Elden Ring took me about 140h to complete for the first time

Witcher 3, about 150h

Baldur's Gate 3, about 120h

Shadow of War, a bit over 100h

...the list goes on, but there's a couple that I can remember.

---

Online / live service games are obviously also up there (I literally have 30 000h in WoW), but I guess you're asking about singleplayer games.
    Games wtih good game mechanics (repeated actions are so fun that you don't mind pressing the same button for 100 hours) like Elden Ring (both visual and mechanical fun) or Enter the Gungeon (repetition is literally the game).
    Lots of games can have 120 hours of content. Or rather, there's games where you can (reasonably) sink 120 hours in.

Like ones with a lot of replayability. RPGs with lots of sidequests. MMOs/live service games. Fighting games.

(There's some overlap in those)
    I'd say oblivion, Skyrim, and Factorio, but those games are at *least* 200 hours.
    The Witcher 3 + DLC's
So you're saying it's not about the Destiny, but the Journey?
2 hours? Did you play it? Were you rushing?
It's a game that should be savored and played as a cat.
    There's literally an achievement to beat the game in under 2 hours. Casually it will take longer but it's not a long game if you play semi efficiently
Stray is eight to ten hours long on a blind playthrough.  Are you sure you're not thinking of the speedrun?  Or another game entirely?
    8 to 10 hours is gigantic stretch. The game is not 2 hours like that other guy said but it's about 5h at most, if you take it slowly. You'd have to play the game twice and get all the trophies to get to 10 hours.
Every awards show is bullshit
yeah there was some hate initially, because it was a cat game. People were like “you’re a cat wow so innovative” etc etc
    I don't think that's why there was hate (it was a while ago so maybe I forget). The problem was that it had so much hype surrounding it: the reveal trailer was one of the most interesting I've seen for ages, with such amazing atmosphere and tone. Combine that with Internet cat frenzy, some of the news that came out about how they'd been working on it for quite a while and spent a lot of time trying to replicate realistic cat movement, everyone's imagination went wild on a hugely innovative game.

The atmosphere and tone in the game itself is great, and the story behind it pretty cool, but the game behind it is very simple. Movement and platforming was fairly simplistic and there isn't much to it beyond following the story and the cool world they created. This was reflected in its price, and is clearly all it was ever really meant to be, but expectations are guided by hopes and dreams sometimes.

I thought it was a fun game. Great atmosphere and a nice story, chill to play.
    I think making a game where you play as a cat is innovative lol never understood the sarcasm sentiment behind those statements
        I could definitely understand it being a gimmick but they put a lot of effort into making a cat protagonist be a core mechanic to the game that it felt innovative. It was a pretty well made simulator.
I knew someone was gonna say this...

Yes, while Cyberpunk *as a genre* leans into specific themes, it's not always as ham-fisted about it and it doesn't *have to*.  You wouldn't normally expect a game about a cat trying to get back to his friends to actually just be 10 hours of completely unapologetic political commentary that just happens to have a cat in the background, even if set in a "cyberpunk" setting.

By all means, I'll take my downvotes for not jerking off that particular horse like the rest of reddit loves to.
    [removed]
        Sounds a whole lot more like you're the one "offended" here.  Learn to have a civil conversation.

I'm a big fan of cyberpunk as a genre, and Stray very much felt like a bait and switch with what it was actually about.  But please, insult me some more for acknowledging that you can try to tell a story about something and *kind of do a shitty job at it*.
A Street Cat's Tale. You straight-up roleplay a cat's daily life. What I didn't expect was how easy it is to, er, "fail." I was expecting more of a cute RPG and less cat survival RPG.
    "Bury your poop before a predator finds it! You have 3 seconds!"
Little Kitty Big City
    Itty Bitty Kitty City
Cattails!
    Catrails works as well, yknow since the cats jumping is kinda on rails
The Mithra race in FFXI and FFXIV would like a word...

If you're into MMOs and wanna play a cat girl, well, there you go. :)
    That's not playing as a cat. It's just being a weeb. It's still fun, but the wrong idea for this
Cat Quest

Edit, The purring quest also, I liked that one
But Khajit has wares if you have coin!
Borgo the Cat
I mean, even if all you were expecting was actual platforming, you'll be disappointed. It's cute, but it has little gameplay - a few puzzles and a little bit of blob dodging.
I don't think there's really enough *game* there to even nominate it for GOTY, honestly. It's a very well executed little oddity, but (even though I freaking love cats) imo there are many games that have done the 'limited gameplay to tell an immersive story' genre far better. But those games don't have the novelty or name recognition of Stray, so they're overlooked while this one is overexposed.
    I mean people in this thread are being harsh on Stray for limited gameplay but surely Stray’s more complex and longer than something like Limbo, which many people had the same fondness for when it came out.  Some of us are just fine with taking a certain amount of style as a substitute for substance.  A short game with low interactivity but a lot of cinematic beauty isn’t automatically bad.
        I think you're deliberately missing my point. I said myself that Stray executes its concept well.
