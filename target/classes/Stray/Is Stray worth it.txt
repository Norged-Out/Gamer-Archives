[[Is Stray worth it]]


I’ve been eyeing Stray for a while and it’s $10 off atm. I play on a laptop in my dorm and would most likely only be able to play on the lowest settings which might take away from the beauty of the game, which I heard was one of the biggest appeals. Is Stray worth the $20 price point for the length and gameplay and if I play on low graphics?


I personally loved Stray. The world is so unique and the story was really moving. It’s a special game to me. 
If you’re planning to buy it on Steam, here’s an idea: buy it, play for up to 2 hours, that’s plenty of time to get a feel for the game and judge if you’ll want to continue or not. If it’s not your cup of tea, just request a refund from steam.
I’m going to contradict and vote a strong yes. It’s a game you play for 10 hours or whatever but it’s incredibly moving. It’s one of the most moving game experiences I’ve played.
    Same here!! I’ve played it through a few times and I love the atmosphere
    Same I was going to be like yes yes 1000 times yes
    Would you say it’s somewhat similar to Gris where it’s mostly a short, story-based walking simulator?
        No - not really. It’s more like a mini action adventure. The storytelling style is also very different than Gris.
        I think it's fair to compare them since they are both a very specific experience crafted by the designer that you play through. They are not games so much as interactive stories. 

They both are fantastic.
Yes yes yes.

It's one of those games that sticks with you for a long time, well it was for me anyway.
I absolutely loved that game. I cried when I finished it. Definitely worth it. I want to play it again. I hope they make a sequel!
I loved Stray so much but I did get to play it for free because my girlfriend has PS Now or whatever the ps5 online subscription is called.

The fleeing from enemies parts are a little stressful which I understand not everyone wants in their cozy games, but for me the environments and the characters more than made up for it. It’s a cool world and I loved the story.
Stray is one of the best games I’ve ever played! 

The character gameplay, music, and storyline is all so well executed and I just fell in love with the vibe of the whole game! I plan on eventually replaying it, I love it that much! I just loved the atmosphere and world in Stray and loved learning about the robots backstories!

Even thought the entire play through is only about 8-10 hours total, it’s worth the full price imo! So def grab it on sale!
It’s an incredible game and i am absolutely shocked that people are saying no. It’s more of an experience than a game but it’s 100% worth it. It’s so unique and well-made, there’s not really anything else like it. $20 is a steal for it, especially if you love cats.
Its gonna go a sale again. No need to stress if you cant get it this time
I think it all depends on what you think is cozy. I think the art and the premise is cozy; However, the gameplay is definitely not cozy for me. Lots of sneaking, dodging, and you can die if you fail. 

I just wish I'm just a cat on this post-apocalyptic world, and just explore, talk to people, etc. 

Again, if you're okay with the gameplay, I say go for it!
    Little kitty big city is coming out soon which sounds like something you’d love!
        Aaah thank you! I’ll check that out :D
    100% same here
I personally think it is.  I did not find the enemies and having to do some stealth stressful.  You have to get used to the controls during those parts a bit because they aren't extremely smooth sometimes but I found it easy.  There are collectibles and some of the trophies are quite cute if you want to 100% the game.  The puzzles are very charming.  The story is fantastic and well told.  I enjoyed it and think it's worth a play.  Yes it is short but it's quite a unique game.
I loved stray! It did make me sad to see kitties in danger/harmed. There are some very exciting/stressful moments where you need to evade enemies. But in between there are moments where you walk your kitty around the retro-futuristic city, meet friendly robots, look for stuff. 

It’s not long but I was really sad when it was over. Nothing has ever really come close to the same vibe for me. After I finished it I took a break on gaming because I wanted something similar and just couldn’t find it!
    I haven’t made it far because that first moment of cat peril made my 12yo daughter so upset I had to turn the whole thing off.
        I was really on the fence at the first sight of cat distress I won’t lie. But it is worth it!
            Can your cat actually die in game? We’ve got a senior cat who’s having kidney issues - I may need to put this one on the back burner for quite awhile.
                Well kind of. You “die” in certain situations, like there are kind of mini-game situations where you have to evade the enemies (they’re like alien blobs) and if you don’t you “die” and restart from a checkpoint. I can’t recall if you see the body or not.
I'd say absolutely yes. It's gorgeous and totally worth it just to experience the incredible world they've created. I loved it so much.
100% yes, it's worth the full price and more
Stray is one of those absolute treasures that when you’re done, you compare the feeling of playing that game for the first time against any new games you start. And none of them come fucking close.
I'd say yes, worth it. It's not a long game, but I loved the story and the vibes.
No, not in my opinion. It’s light on content, short, and has more “dodging of enemies” and death from failure than I’d expected or wanted.
    Oh wow, I've had it on my wishlist but that will probably have me take it off. I don't need the stress. 😅
        Yeah, just chiming in to disagree as well. 🤭 98% of the game, you get to wander around these gorgeous, expansive dystopian cities, with absolutely zero enemies or stressors. The action scenes are very short and sweet, and not at all punishing, as they set you right back at the beginning of the scene to try again. I wouldn't write it off, it's an amazing game. It's worth it for the art alone.
        I heavily disagree. It’s a beautiful story, a very immersive world, and the “enemy” sequences are generally short and if you die you start over at a checkpoint and can try again. It’s really not that bad. It’s all a part of a really well told story imo. To me, it was a phenomenal game.
        Yeah, if it had been a feline walking sim I would have enjoyed it. Even as short as it is. But the enemies made it stressful and not very fun, dying via suffocation or whatever it is they do to you was not a good experience.
            Omg! 🙀 That does not sound fun. Poor kitty...
I love the game. It's emotional and had me thinking about it for a while after. If a game does that for me it's usually a win in my books regardless of the length.
I liked the game but I agree with others that it’s stressful dodging enemies at times. There were some parts that I had my husband do because it was either too hard for me or I got too stressed.  There’s a mod out there for PC though that you can download to make the game less stressful which is what I did on my second playthrough. Much more pleasant lol

But the story is great and I even cried at the end.  I enjoyed walking around as a cat.
    Oh what! Could you link me that mod?? I actually just got the game through Steam family share and would love to play it but was worried because so many people brought up the chase & dodge parts
        it took me a little bit to find cause it’s been so long but I used this one!

eta: you might need to pay for it? I don’t remember doing that but I vaguely remember there being an option to buy something
I’m stuck on an early bug that I can’t get past to even play past 2 hours
    That’s a late bug hahaha
It's a very cute game. I like some aspects of it like how you can REALLY get into "being a cat" like randomly scratching at stuff, meowing, napping, etc.. and I would say it's pretty cozy for the most part (except being chased by the mutant rat things) but I got bored quickly and didn't end up finishing it. You might feel differently.
It's a pleasant game, but kinda light on content. I think it's worth playing, but wait for a 50% discount or better, imo.
    Have you seen it on that much of a sale? I've had it on my wishlist since before Christmas and most I've seen is the 35% off that it's on for now
        No, but I haven't been looking. It's gotta be deeply discounted at some point in the future.
It's a cute game with nice graphics and a heartwarming story, although >!heartwarming could be controversial based on the game events!<. Just be mindful that it's a very short game.
I really liked the concept and played about an hour of the game but I got a little bit motion sick with the camera control.
You don’t play Stray for the gameplay. You play for the story
I didn’t end up enjoying it as much as I thought I would : ( 
The world isn’t super engaging and the gameplay can be frustrating. 
It has cute/fun moments though! And the animation is wonderful. I loved finding good napping spots for my cat and chilling while the camera zoomed away.

It might worth it for you though of course! Especially if you don’t mind not getting 100% completion and don’t mind chase sequences
I love that game a lot! I haven't played the game but I saw it's full gameplay on YouTube, it's got one of the best stories.
I loved every minute of it. I didn't rush the story and spent a lot of time just running around exploring. The story is really good and the gameplay was great. I will be playing it again sometime and no doubt work on getting the achievements I don't have.
I love Stray so much and had a lot of fun playing it.  It was so charming and really, I just love being the cat.
I wouldn't call it a "cozy" game but it's amazing. It's really fun and well done. The art direction is A+
The gameplay was a bit lacking but I loved the story. I enjoyed it for a weekend
I absolutely loved Stray. I waited for a physical copy (cause I like physical), and think I bought it for $45. It is a great game. The world is fantastic, gameplay is fun, soundtrack rules, but it is short and not really replayable. I think I platinumed it in maybe 14 hrs?

Was a great ride. Again, really loved it. Definitely worth at least $20 in my eyes for most gamers. One of thosr games I can see me sitting down to beat again one day. Would love to go back to that world if they ever do a follow up.

EDIT: (Forgot to comment on graphics) I don't think the graphics are a massive selling point, personally. It looks good, but it looks like an indie PS4 game. So your laptop might knock it out just fine. I played it on PS5 though, so I can't be 100% certain.
It was a 10/10 experience for me, even better if you're a cat person. Some of the things you can do in that game made me smile so much. And my kitties enjoyed watching me play it
You wouldn’t play stray if the main character wasn’t a cat and the main character being a cat has no bearing on the story or the game play. 

It’s an average game that really hinges on whether you can buy into the cat or not. I don’t think they did enough with the concept. You could swap the cat for a rat or a dog and it would make no difference.

It’s a short game, with good graphics and a decent loop of searching and climbing environments occasionally interjected with chase sections.
YES. Its an incredible game. Fun, adorable, beautiful, emotional… well worth $20.
Stray was hands down my game of the year last year. The story telling is amazing, the atmosphere is beautiful. It's a really unique experience. I want to go back and play it again in a few years.
i looooved it!! it was such a charming world they made, and the characters and stories were so fleshed out and engaging
I really enjoyed playing it, but i stopped after i learned how unforgiving some of the gameplay creatures could be, so i never went back to finish it. I personally didn't like some the stress I'd experienced up until i paused the game a bit.

I'm a bit 50/50 on the worth tbh 🫣
Yes I loved it! Was free on ps plus
Yes !!!! Its only flow is that it is too short imo, I took 7-8 hours to finish it
Yes, it’s a great game!!!
I played through it five times. Is worth it! Graphics won't be a problem.
I actually never considered this a "cozy game" when I was playing it at all, so if you are set on only playing that one genre of game, it might not be for you, but I think you should give it a shot anyway because it's great. I just finished the game like a week ago, and I'm still thinking about it, even though I beat the game in about 8 hours. In fact, I'm thinking of playing it again because I know I missed a few things, and I want to know everything that happens to the characters. Really cool, unique story and world. I'd make sure you have headphones in, the soundtrack is really really neat, helps you feel the atmosphere.
I thought it was short and ended a bit too abruptly but I still enjoyed it. Would probably play again if between other games.
I love the story but a lot of the game was stressful and scary to me so I didn't really progress that far past the first safe zone you find. I opted to just watch lets plays
Yes!!
I can only say I passed on buying it but I would watch a person on stream play it before I played it.  It is not bad.  It’s just any story I can write in two paragraphs is not a game I play for story.

I hope those who play it love it.  It’s a type of game that is hit or miss for me.
I think it’s a really good game, definitely a bit expensive at full price though. It’s a great story, amazing setting and atmosphere, it’s great if you like puzzle games and figuring out the story.

There are a few intense chase sections though, which will deter you if you can’t handle stress, but there’s only like 4 or 5 from what I can remember and like others have said, very moving story and ending so for me (I hate intense chasing or combat) it was worth it. I recommend it on sale!
I wanted to love the game, but unfortunately for me something about the motion of gameplay made me feel a bit sick so I had to stop. If you have similar sensitivities to motion sickness, it might not be for you either.
I’m going to go against what everyone’s saying lol. I actually didn’t like it and refunded it. The story may be great (which didn’t really develop much in the time I played it bc I had to keep it under 2 hrs for the refund lol), but it’s a pretty rigid platformer. I was so bored in all honesty. I was waiting for it to go somewhere, and it didn’t. There wasn’t anything really challenging or complex about it; it told you were to go and that’s where you went.
To me this game is not worth buying at any price. The gameplay is boring, there is very little to do, the commands to jump are only at set points (you really dont have free control of the cat), and I didnt really find any of it fun. Sure its "cute" but that doesnt give it a free pass on being boring.

If you cant play on max graphics settings with ray tracing on then this game has almost nothing to offer. The only part of the game I did enjoy was the good ray tracing and graphics, but even that is not worth paying for - as there are plenty of free or very cheap RTX demos out there.
Same here!! I’ve played it through a few times and I love the atmosphere
Same I was going to be like yes yes 1000 times yes

        Can your cat actually die in game? We’ve got a senior cat who’s having kidney issues - I may need to put this one on the back burner for quite awhile.
            Well kind of. You “die” in certain situations, like there are kind of mini-game situations where you have to evade the enemies (they’re like alien blobs) and if you don’t you “die” and restart from a checkpoint. I can’t recall if you see the body or not.
