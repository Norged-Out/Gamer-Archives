I would look at it in terms of the ability you want- but the lightning temple/divine beast was the hardest IMO, Thunderblight ganon seemed so much harder to beat than the others.

 I think mipha has the best power because she can revive you when you die in a fight so I'd start with the water temple, then air temple since revalis gale is SOOOOO useful for exploring. In my experience daruk was easier to get than urbosa, but an ability I used waaaay less since urbosas fury is great when you're fighting and I mostly used daruks protection for fall damage. 

I'd recommend:
Water 
Air 
Lightning (if you can beat it!)
Fire
    Wait a minute, you can negate fall damage with Daruk's protection ?
        You can! :)
            How do you use it to negate fall damage?
                Just activate it before you hit the ground?
                    I would just hold ZR the whole way. Well, I'll probably spam it too!
                    I think so, but I'd recommend googling since I gave BOTW to my sister when I got TOTK so I can't test it, sorry!
    You have an infinite use glider, why the fuck would you waste Daruk on fall damage?
        That's what I'm saying, I barely ever used daruk
            How? Do you never block?
                You can turn off the blessings in the key items menu.
                    But why
                        because it would get used up randomly and be on cool down whenever I actually need it. I'd rather just not use it, than get used to it and then die because i was expecting it to be there when it wasnt.
                            That’s just weird
                                I usually turn it on for a boss fight or for fighting a guardian. But if I'm just running around through Hyrule I'd rather control my parries.
    Seconded. This order is also great for navigating the difficulty curve in the game. Vah Ruta is challenging, but not impossible and tackling it first will prepare you well for the rest of the journey
    Personally I’d flip the first two. Revali’s Gale is just so, so helpful for getting around. Alternatives exist for Mipha’s Grace
        Agree 💯
        Yeah, priority 1A and 1B is getting Revali's Gale, and going to Faron to stock up on hearty durians and mighty bananas. Up to you if you'd rather have the temp hearts and attack buffs for Vah Medoh, or the Gale for getting around Faron, but either way, these two set the rest of the game on cruise control.

        Fair but now I'm playing TOTK with no miphas grace and feel like I'm constantly grinding for fairies. I prefer yunobos power to daruks still. But no way I'm getting the timing right to pause and scarf down some food
The order i did: vah medoh (the bird), vah ruta (the elephant), vah rudania (the lizard) and vah naboris (the camel)
I *think* the story wants you to do ruta (tons of npcs guiding you to it) -> rudania (keep heading to death mountain and there will be people with stuff to help you traverse the terrain) -> medoh -> naboris (hardest one for sure).

Though the order I see most suggested is ruta -> medoh -> rudania -> naboris bc medoh comes with easily the best ability for traversal.
I personally suggest this order

The elephant in east first because the power you get there is really good

Then the camel in south west second as the boss is hard and keeping it for later will make it worse (also practice parrying and dodging, or make some food)

Third is the eagle in north west

Then the lizard on north east last as its reward I'd say its the most disappointing as you never get to use it right and is on cooldown most of the time
    agree since the HP of blights go up each time you beat one, thunderblight is worth getting out of the way. the only one i’m struggling with on my first play through
        I didn't know that about the HP of blights going up with each one you kill.
            https://www.reddit.com/r/Breath_of_the_Wild/s/h1USMwpO8F this post explains better:))
        Thanks. I’m doing my first master mode play through and stumbled on this post. Didn’t know they were scaled and I have trouble with thunder blight so I’ll tackle that first.
            if you still struggle, i’d get miphas grace first then try again just because it might help even if it has a few hundred extra HP
[I go adventuring first](https://www.reddit.com/r/Breath_of_the_Wild/s/DZeu5GXuMH), and by the time I'm ready to kick some Blight ass, I always start with Ruta because I love the story progression. This is the one the game intends to be first, so it's got the beefiest story. Then Medoh, because Ravioli's Gale, and then Rudania because Naboris *has* to be last, always last, because once you free Horsey Fatback, you are unceasingly harassed by goddamn motherfucking Yiga, now and forever, amen and I ***hate*** that because Urbosa's Fury is a *hell* of a thing, and I would *love* to have it first; it would make a lot of early game shit a lot easier \*cough\* Eventide \*cough,\* but I want to explore in peace, goddamnit, and Keese and stalfux are enough of a fukken hassle as it is... trynna sneak up on a horse or a lizard or some such, and all of a sudden, FUCK YOU, skeleton monsters... now that TotK is out, I *loathe* that there's no Dazzlefruit in this game
    I usually do Medoh first because, yeah. I usually do Naboris next, so Thunderblight doesn't have as much hp. Yiga spawning out of the middle of nowhere is so annoying, but the Fury is so convenient for groups of monsters or mini boss fights. Luckily we have stasis+, so I just freeze Yigas and shoot them in the face with a Savage Bow. Foot soldiers dispatch in one shot. It may take three or four shots in the face for Blademasters, though. Tough bastards. They must like Ironshrooms with their bananas.

I always wait until after the Champion's Ballad to do Eventide. Vah Room and Urbosa plus make the island child's play.

For horses, I just shoot them with an ice arrow, using a low powered Bow.

I miss Puff Shrooms for guaranteed sneak strikes and throwing a Dazzlefruit at the ground near Stals is so OP.

Whenever I play Tears, all I can think about is Botw. After a few hours of Botw, I go back to Totk and vice versa.

In Botw, I miss Ascend, Ultrahand, Puff Shrooms, Dazzlefruit, and building vehicles.

In Tears, I miss Stasis+, unlimited bombs, Windbombing, my fully awakened Master Sword, the Master Cycle, most of the Ancient stuff (The horse gear, bow, shield, armor, shortsword, and arrows) Lynel swords, the original Satori Mountain where I would stock up on Beetles, Hearty, and Hightail Lizards, and not to mention...

HEARTY FUCKING DURIANS!!!
The divine power you get from the desert 🐪 is too powerful not to get it first. It makes the rest of the divine beast battles a lot smoother.
Vah Medoh, because you get Revali's gale.

Vah Ruta, much easier with Revali's Gale (otherwise , really hard to get to Zora's Domain)

Vah Rudania

Vah Naboris, definitely last.
My order was Ruta > Medoh > Rudania. I have yet to face Naboris ;_; Rudania was the easiest for me, but in terms of powers, Revali's Gale has been the most useful and made it possible for me to get all the towers. Mipha's Grace is close second.
Every shrine I beat I use to increase stamina. I get to Faron tower as soon as possible. Usually as soon as I arrive at the hateno ancient lab. I just make my way up the coast (the mountains not the beach) and hang a right before Lurelin. Faron Tower is clutch. Hearty durians  north for heart buff. Mighty bananas on the cliffs to the south for strength buff. Once I’ve collected 40 orbs, I go to Hateno to visit the cursed statue and trade for hearts. I go to the lost woods and get master sword. Then back to hateno to switch back to stamina.

*Then* I go Mipha, Revali, Daruk, Urbosa
1. Vah Ruta, promise this isn’t bc i’m a mipha fan, not only is it the closest to kakariko, it definetly provides the best power, which is being able to revive, it also has the second easiest blight gannon, and zoras domain is very useful for early game. (YOU ALSO DONT HAVE TO KILL THE LYNEL TO GET THE SHOCK ARROWS!!)

2. This one honestly depends what you’re looking for, Vah Rudania will require potions to keep you alive in death mountain until you get the flambreaker armor, but you do get daruks protection, which will completely block three hits, vah rudania itself is one of the harder dungeons (none of them are that hard) but fire blight gannon won’t cause you much issues. The other one i would recommend is Vah Medoh. it by far is the easiest divine beast and blight gannon, and gives you regalia gail which is the best power, but make sure you have the armor to withstand the wind, i would say these two are interchangable. 

3. Vah Naboris. definetly the best story quest out of all the divine beasts, and the dungeon itself isn’t hard, but holy shit thunderblight is not for the weak. my dumbass did it with four hearts and it took me three days to finally kill it, trust me it’s not worth all of that for urbosas fury, wait until later
Personally, if I were playing BOTW again I would tackle them from easiest to hardest. 

In my opinion this is:

1) Vah Rudania
2) Vah Medoh
3) Vah Ruta 
4) Vah Naboris
  
In order of puzzle difficulty of the beast themselves, I'd go Bird, Lizard, Elephant then Camel.  
But in order of what champion skills I want- Bird, Camel, Elephant, Lizard- this is the order that takes more practice and exploring (because you want the lightning proof armour and Ancient shields and weapons for the second beast to make it significantly easier)
My personal recommendation: water, lightning, fire, air

Based on best order in terms of difficulty scaling. When you beat a beast, the next bosses health gets raised. Since fire and air are the easiest, I do them last.

Based on best power obtained, I'd go water, air, fire, lightning

You can swap the first two, revali is amazing
If you die lots- Zora first, otherwise do Hebra first. Eldin after those and end with Gerudo. It’s the best overall gameplay experience based on which powers you get. 

I think the game wants Zora, Eldin, Hebra, and end with Gerudo though based on where shrines are placed to attract you.
I did Medoh, Ruta, Naboris, then Rudania. 

Medoh first because everyone was saying it was easiest and you get the best reward from it. Ruta second because it's also fairly easy. 

I was going to do Naboris last, but ended up doing it 3rd because the bosses get more health as you go and I didn't want to do the hardest boss when it had the highest amount of health. By that point in the game I had enough hearts, stamina, and general experience that I felt pretty confident going in (So even now that I know that the bosses get harder, I'd probably still do Naboris 3rd). 

And then I did Rudania last because it was all I had left at that point.
I think the way I did it was great for me honestly: the elephant, the bird, the lizard, the camel.
Honestly, only the thunderblight ganon was kinda hard but the rest were pretty easy the moment you get the momentum.
The natural order is vah ruta, vah rudania vah medoh vah naboris. Purely bc after u finish the impa main story part ur close enough to start vah ruta then rudania then medoh then naboris. Defo do naboris last, hardest by far. Defo do ruta first, ur gonna gain amazing combat skills from vah ruta if u do it right. Rudania and medoh are pretty much interchangeable. The skills I got from vah ruta allowed me to blaze thru the whole game. Also vah ruta easily has the best ability especially in the early/mid game.
I did water, fire, lightning, and air. So elephant, gecko, camel (?), birb. Mipha's power is super useful and Duruk' protection helps a lot against thunderblight Ganon who I found was the hardest of the 4.
Bird  easiet and best ability 
Elephant also east and cheeseable good enough ability
Lizard hard and ability is good if you suck
Camel toe hardest by far in everything best combat ability
Ruta, Rudania, Medoh, Nabooris

If you mean in terms of usefulness

Medoh, Ruta, Rudania, Nabooris
Naboris, , Medoh, Rudania, Ruta
I think the game wants you to do elephant -> volcano lizard -> bird -> camel (sorry I don’t remember the real names hahah). That’s my guess, since the early game story funnels you to the eastern village where you get divine beast quest, and the elephant is right next door. This is the order I did it in and no regrets. You get to explore contiguously without fast travel or backtracking (which to be clear I did do, but I’d only explore new areas where I last left off). You also get Mipha’s Grace first which is great because I’m garbage at combat in this game. 

If you’re trying to optimize for a particular thing, I think these are the advantages:

Elephant -> second wind that saves you from dying, good if you’re garbage at combat like me
Lizard -> invincibility that you need to actively trigger by blocking, same advantage as above but you’ll have to at least know to block on time
Bird -> makes exploration easier. I did enjoy the half of the game I played without this, and I imagine having this early on would have taken away a lot of the challenge of climbing some structures. 
Camel -> you get a big area attack and stun. I got this the last, and I didn’t start using it till way later because again like I said, I’m bad at combat. I think if combat is holding you back, this would be a good one to get early.
It's all about personal preference. It all depends on your style of play.

Medoh for exploring and that awesome Great Eagle Bow.
Naboris for offense.
Mipha for a quick and easy heart to pull that Master Sword and so you don't get one shot in early game.
Rudania for defense.
The game is as easy or difficult as you make it. Whatever you want to do at that moment. That's the beauty of Botw.

Hell, Tears too!
i did ruta, rudania, naboris, then medoh
The order I recommend:

Vah Rutah: as having a revive ability when you stumble upon a horde of enemies you are NOT ready for helps and when you get slapped off the side of a mountain and have to ragdoll all the way down.

Vah Rudania: this gets you a handy shield for when you get jumped by an enemy so you can have the time to switch out the Korok leaf for something a little more sporty...like a branch.

Vah Medoh: this helps you get to higher ground fast or faster travel in general, helps with escaping most enemies, but not so much with Guardians...they have some sick Skeet shooting skills. However this DOES help you get to the top of Towers faster and some of those are a right pain in the tail feathers.

Vah Naboris: This is a handy offensive attack, but you do have to beat the  Road Raging Road Runner on Meth in order to get it. Best go through the others as a bit of a practice first. We can't all be TheHumbleNoob and beat it first try.
I’d say wind fire water thunder
I recommend Lightning first. Now hear me out, the divine beasts scale up in difficulty the more progress in the game that you make so if you do Thunderblight at the start it should be easier. Then do Waterblight, you can use Urbosa's Fury to knock Waterblight into the water to incapacitate them and get Mipha's Grace. Go after Fireblight and beat them using bombs and Urbosa's Fury. Lastly, Go to Windblight and use Daruk's Protection as needed using  Urbosa's for damage and Mipha's as a safety net.
Wait a minute, you can negate fall damage with Daruk's protection ?
    You can! :)
        How do you use it to negate fall damage?
            Just activate it before you hit the ground?
                I would just hold ZR the whole way. Well, I'll probably spam it too!
