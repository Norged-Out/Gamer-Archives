Strange how the shrine wasn’t placed near the path
    I liked it this way. It was much more fun to paraglide into the town
        Completely agree, but I still think the path should be closer so that it’s an option people would at least sometimes take
            Isn’t there a korok on the bridge?
                there is yes.
                And it looks like OP already has it, from that one path across the bridge from north to south
                    I think that path looks like it goes under the bridge
                        Yep I think it’s at about the half-way mark.
                There's a bridge?
            Nah. I almost never used roads/paths until I had beaten the game and went for completionist with the seeds. First steps (after plateau) for me were all towers and shrines…unless I wanted a break and moved the plot forward.
                Wait, there was a plot?
                    Yeah, the yellow dots on the map…right?
                        Oh ya the side quests!
                    The plot is always “link wakes up to find the world in ruin/predestined to save the world from ruin, but it’s too late and Ganon has the triforce. Go save the day!”
        I just wish there was a cool “entry point” from the paraglide. Maybe a town park wi the a cool decorative arch. Instead I’m dodging buildings
            I hear you there. I wish there was a way to get to the intended path by paragliding. It seems like the town is just a bunch of shops and some random homes. Not much else. It could be a lot more tbh
                Always felt like Link's should have a house there too.  Start renting one of them out to NPCs
            I like the building dodging tbh. Makes me feel like I’m being sneaky
            If you come at it from the fairy fountain, there's somewhat of a landing runway.
                That’s just base jumping with extra steps lol
            Glide in someone’s window, I wonder if you can do that actually, hmm
                You don’t fit 😭 + it doesn’t work cuz it’s not loaded
        Paragliding is always fun, just think maybe the land bridge could’ve been revolved like 90 degrees down and keep the shrine up on a hill so you can paraglide if you want
        Add the benefit of visiting the great fairy on the way as well
    I think the point was to get you to not go the path
    Easier to see the fairy garden from the glide over I think
    It almost never is, and that seems intentional
    I agree, but it might be because it is a town that wasn’t…built into the history of the world. People didn’t settle around a shrine, but instead one dude just said “I’m gonna build a town and put it here” and then decided to go HARD on advertising

Also I always just assumed you were intended to put the travel medallion in town near the goddess statue
It's ok, that road conecting to the rest of the land is only for a korok, not an entrance at all 🙄.
    Hey I like to take my horse in to town
        The horse’s name was Friday
            For me it was Tuesday.
            Bowers!
                Bowser?
    There’s no warp point near it.
        I've got my teleportation spot set right at the bridge personally.
            I usually put mine right in front of the throne room, since I don’t feel like having to trek through hyrule castle all the time, lol
                I put mine in that collisseum type area
            [deleted]
                Master trials travel medallion
                    It's not master trials related, but it is a part of the DLC
                        Ahh
        There is, it's near the fairy fountain
            They mean near the bridge so you don’t have to glide over.
Restocking arrows ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|give_upvote)
    Exactly lmao

Even though they only sell me normal wooden arrows at this point
        Wait you guys buy arrows?
            Yeah

Going in all of the villages + korok forest gives you ≈160 normal wooden arrows
                Island next to Eventide and they are free.
                    Wait really?
                        Yes. I have maxed arrows at all times. And electric arrows are easy but time taking, you get them from Polymus Mountain. They are stuck in the trees. Fire and Ice are tougher. I’m using amiibos. I never get low enough that stores sell them.

Edit: https://youtu.be/-C088GFVq04
                            Free bomb arrows above skull lake when it rains.
                            Thank you!
                                No problem. Good luck.
            Wait how do you get arrows?
                There is an island off of the coast of Eventide. Put your medallion there. Every-time you leave and come back the chest reappears and you get more arrows. Keep doing it till you max. 

For bomb arrows go the tree by Akkala Wilds. Set a camp somewhere and sleep till there is rain. Run around whistling and the baddies will shoot bomb arrows that won’t explode. Pick them up. Repeat till max.
                    >Every-time you leave and come back

  


Also every time you save and load. Get the chest out, loot the arrows, save, load that save, and the chest will have respawned.

                I farm the lizalfo camps on the way to Zora's Domain. You can fly in from Ruta once he's done and it's pretty quick to get 80-99 arrows once you get a good path.
                Take a multishot bow (3x lynel bow or a 5x if you're lucky) and go to the torch at the entrance to the lost woods. Stand right in front of the torch and fire one arrow into it and pick up three. Free arrows, no farming, no cheats.
                    that is the definition of farming, doing something over and over again to get materials.
                        You're technically and pedantically correct, but hitting right trigger > A button > right trigger > A button for three minutes is a much faster farming loop than warping to the chest next to eventide over and over, or traveling to every vendor to buy arrows.
                            yes sorry, I meant pedantically not contextually.
                    You can do that in the cooking pot at the bizarre as well.
                ist, you can look it up online, it allows 12000 arrows of every kind in like 20 mins or so, really op
            You don't??
                Nope, keep reading and you’ll discover why bro.
            i just feel like at a certain point you have so much money it’s just easier to buy the arrows than farm them
Me in one night while finishing the town quests in one sitting… 😂
    I did that on my second playthrough and it was wild
        It was *wild*? Like... like breath of.. like the breath of the...
            Yes! Exactly like *"Tears of the Kingdom"*!
    This was me last night…hadn’t done it before and saw people saying it was the best quest in the game
Honestly I think the path is only there to give a plausible explanation for how people got there. Otherwise they would have left it an island.
    Yeah i think nobody uses it as the actual entrance
        I do sometimes, but it's more for the feel.
You missed the cutscene going across that bridge?
    Wait, what?
    There’s a cutscene?!
    There’s a cutscene?
    This is a joke, right?
    WHAT
    WHAT
I just have my medalion placed there
    Feels like a wasted spot if you can just warp to the shrine and glide in. 

I put mine in tough to reach places with goods needed when farming.
        I literally dont use mine... i need to.
Durians have a tower right there,
I use the desert fairy,
Yiga hideout has an urbosa dlc shrine,
Castle is a fun run for me,
Lynels & Guardians i just ride the bike,
And I Only use Tarrey Town and Korok Forest.
            I use mine constantly. If I’m doing some side thing I’ll place it to leave and get supplies and come right back where I was. 

It’s super useful for Koroks that have you throwing rocks. If you miss just warp back and the rocks are there again. 

It has many uses.
                just walk away slightly and they (rocks) come back too!
                    I was never sure how far you were to walk for it to happen. So never tried 😂 but I’ll use that next time.
                        You just have to walk far enough for them to fade out. Same goes for trees. Even if you cut them down, if you walk away to the point they fade out and you come back, they'll be all back to normal.
        [deleted]
            Nice!
        mmmm thats a good way of thinking. Ive had mine there for so long never reconsidered it
            It’s nice when Lynel hunting, I’ll place it in the north be the great skeleton.
    Slapped mine near the top of Polymus so I can warp, equip, and murder a Lynel after each blood moon.
    I have it placed right in the middle near the Hylia statue.
I did the same . It’s just faster lol
The Intended way isn’t why we still play 😄
I mean why did they build next to a perfectly glidable cliff then?
    "It makes no sense!"
    I am convinced gliding is intended, otherwise the fairy fountain wouldn’t be at the perfect height to allow you to glide shrine-> fountain-> T town.
jumping off stuff and paragliding is infinitely more fun than just running on the ground
That’s the intended way?
    It isn't. The stone bridge is the intended way
        …I always used it on the way out of town
            Nah man i always teleport out of town
                I literally don't think I ever left Tarrey Town on foot. Warp to the platform and paraglide down, buy your arrows and *zoop* warp right out. No need for the bridge.
Wow. I think the only time I took the land bridge was when I got the korok seed. Every other time I just used the glider from the shrine.
    Lmao i got that korok just after i took the screen
You can't tell me flying over from the shrine isn't the intended way lol. I did go on the bridge at least once to get the korok seeds.
    Yeah i got that seed right after taking this screenshot lmao
I mean, the tower is so much better!
I walked out once to check if there was stables or something like that outside. Never in.
That’s called a [desire path](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_path).
The only time I’ve been on the path was to get the korok
    Lmao yeah i got it right after taking this screenshot
Me too. Me too...
Mine probably looks the same haha Everyone else needs a way to get there 😂
I see nothing wrong with this picture.
I usually leave the "intended" way, but always float in to TTown
I did it several times during my 100% play through because I liked to Shield Surf down that hill
    Makes sense! 

This is my 100% and first playthrough lmao
I used the path a few times on my horse, but still this very true.
late in the game i made myself walk along the bridge way just to see what it was like. cleared some bokoblin
Why go the normal way when you can ⭐️fly⭐️
i didn’t even realize there was a land bridge until last week. i’m not the smartest sometimes.
Wait meaning the intended way isn’t to windbomb from the shrine???? /j
Literally the only time I've used that route is to get the korok there
    Which is exactly what i did right after taking this screenshot lmao
It takes SO LONG!
Sometimes I like to ride my horse into town and “park” it. But I can't say I do that often 😅
The most useless road in all of Hyrule
If you didn't paraglide over that great view you are a monster
I was sitting here thinking “isn’t gliding into the town from the cliff where the shrine is located the intended path to get to the Tarrey Town” and then took a whole minute to realise the road is actually the intended path😂
    Lmao i guess that's what the villagers used to get there
only time i ever went the intentional way was to get the korok on the bridge
    I did that right after i took this screenshot lmao
I put my travel medallion there
Gotta do it once to get that korok
    Yeah, i got it right after taking this screenshot lmao
Bruh never crossed that bridge *once*
The number of time you didn’t take the bridge.
What you can actually do that actually draw on the map in Buffalo wild I never done that
I always fall off that bridge trying to cross on the motorcycle
The only time I actually use the path is when I'm shield surfing down the hill 😂
Dah hesho for the win!
Not when theres a perfect shield surf route right there……. For me at least
Wait, I went there and there wasn't a town? I think just a shrine
    There's a long quest to do
Lol sometimes I take my motorcycle down that path or have some fun shield surfing
Same
Always from the giant fairy. Every time for me
Accurate
damn, you literally never touched the actual path
Just checked mine and it looks the same lol. Love it.
real
Yea after learning BLSS I also never went the intended way but just did an ultra short BLSS from Akkala tower. Don't ask me why
    Damn i can't even do that
        Yea it's kinda tricky, especially with double joycons. If you want to learn BLSS, first get a procon
            Nah all my money went into TotK
Yeah, I usually glide over
Yeah I usually windbomb over from the nearest shrine.
They should have put a shrine in the cliff side of the town and have a ladder going up.
I did a few times but that is when I thought the devs just put a random statue in the middle of an island for no reason
LOL. Right?!   I think I did once.
This is the way.
    This is the way.
        This is the way.
            This IS the way.
            This is the way.
Yeah
How do you view that?
    It's a function that comes with the DLC
        I see
You may have missed a Korok then!
    I got it exactly a second after i took this screenshot!
There’s a Korok over there … probably
    Got it right after taking this screenshot lmao
There's a koroks on the path that you can get
    I got it right after taking this screenshot thanks though
I only took that path before the town existed
This is the way
This is the way
There's a couple korok seeds you don't have then
I didn't buy furniture for my Hateno-home. And now I have completed tarrey Town, so the "gay-son" is not in Hateno anymore. Luckily, I have the 9 weapon displays. So it's only the furniture. Still a little annoying.
I always paraglide from the shrine to the fairy fountain, then paraglide to the bridge. That way, I can level up my armor before selling all of my useless stuff and buying arrows. Then I go buy ancient tech.
I do it for fun. Also sometimes id like to visit the town with my horse xD
How did you check this :0
Yeah that exact spot is we’re I got pretty good at wind bombing
that means you missed the korok there
*Good. Let the Octopus flow through you
This is the “only” way
Yeah I mean everyone just paraglides you only really need to do it once for a korok and that’s it
    Yea
I just stuck the Travel Medallion down once I got there and realised how many times I'd have to come back.
The hero's path is so useful for knowing where you haven't explored/finding Korok seeds.
    Yeah! Although i didn't use it for that
        Did you walk around the map making rude shapes?
            Lmao i did that on my third playthrough, although it came out horribly
I liked it this way. It was much more fun to paraglide into the town
    Completely agree, but I still think the path should be closer so that it’s an option people would at least sometimes take
        Isn’t there a korok on the bridge?
            there is yes.
            And it looks like OP already has it, from that one path across the bridge from north to south

    Add the benefit of visiting the great fairy on the way as well
I think the point was to get you to not go the path
Easier to see the fairy garden from the glide over I think
It almost never is, and that seems intentional

Exactly lmao

Even though they only sell me normal wooden arrows at this point

        Yeah

Going in all of the villages + korok forest gives you ≈160 normal wooden arrows

Got it right after taking this screenshot lmao
I got it right after taking this screenshot thanks though
Yea
Yeah! Although i didn't use it for that
    Did you walk around the map making rude shapes?
        Lmao i did that on my third playthrough, although it came out horribly
Completely agree, but I still think the path should be closer so that it’s an option people would at least sometimes take
    Isn’t there a korok on the bridge?
        there is yes.
        And it looks like OP already has it, from that one path across the bridge from north to south
            I think that path looks like it goes under the bridge
                Yep I think it’s at about the half-way mark.
        There's a bridge?
    Nah. I almost never used roads/paths until I had beaten the game and went for completionist with the seeds. First steps (after plateau) for me were all towers and shrines…unless I wanted a break and moved the plot forward.
        Wait, there was a plot?
            Yeah, the yellow dots on the map…right?
                Oh ya the side quests!
            The plot is always “link wakes up to find the world in ruin/predestined to save the world from ruin, but it’s too late and Ganon has the triforce. Go save the day!”
I just wish there was a cool “entry point” from the paraglide. Maybe a town park wi the a cool decorative arch. Instead I’m dodging buildings
    I hear you there. I wish there was a way to get to the intended path by paragliding. It seems like the town is just a bunch of shops and some random homes. Not much else. It could be a lot more tbh
        Always felt like Link's should have a house there too.  Start renting one of them out to NPCs
    I like the building dodging tbh. Makes me feel like I’m being sneaky
    If you come at it from the fairy fountain, there's somewhat of a landing runway.
        That’s just base jumping with extra steps lol
    Glide in someone’s window, I wonder if you can do that actually, hmm
        You don’t fit 😭 + it doesn’t work cuz it’s not loaded
Paragliding is always fun, just think maybe the land bridge could’ve been revolved like 90 degrees down and keep the shrine up on a hill so you can paraglide if you want
Add the benefit of visiting the great fairy on the way as well
The horse’s name was Friday
    For me it was Tuesday.
    Bowers!
        Bowser?
I've got my teleportation spot set right at the bridge personally.
    I usually put mine right in front of the throne room, since I don’t feel like having to trek through hyrule castle all the time, lol
        I put mine in that collisseum type area

        Master trials travel medallion
            It's not master trials related, but it is a part of the DLC
                Ahh
There is, it's near the fairy fountain
    They mean near the bridge so you don’t have to glide over.
Wait you guys buy arrows?
    Yeah

Going in all of the villages + korok forest gives you ≈160 normal wooden arrows
        Island next to Eventide and they are free.
            Wait really?
                Yes. I have maxed arrows at all times. And electric arrows are easy but time taking, you get them from Polymus Mountain. They are stuck in the trees. Fire and Ice are tougher. I’m using amiibos. I never get low enough that stores sell them.

Edit: https://youtu.be/-C088GFVq04
                    Free bomb arrows above skull lake when it rains.
                    Thank you!
                        No problem. Good luck.
    Wait how do you get arrows?
        There is an island off of the coast of Eventide. Put your medallion there. Every-time you leave and come back the chest reappears and you get more arrows. Keep doing it till you max. 

For bomb arrows go the tree by Akkala Wilds. Set a camp somewhere and sleep till there is rain. Run around whistling and the baddies will shoot bomb arrows that won’t explode. Pick them up. Repeat till max.
            >Every-time you leave and come back

  


Also every time you save and load. Get the chest out, loot the arrows, save, load that save, and the chest will have respawned.

        I farm the lizalfo camps on the way to Zora's Domain. You can fly in from Ruta once he's done and it's pretty quick to get 80-99 arrows once you get a good path.
        Take a multishot bow (3x lynel bow or a 5x if you're lucky) and go to the torch at the entrance to the lost woods. Stand right in front of the torch and fire one arrow into it and pick up three. Free arrows, no farming, no cheats.
            that is the definition of farming, doing something over and over again to get materials.
                You're technically and pedantically correct, but hitting right trigger > A button > right trigger > A button for three minutes is a much faster farming loop than warping to the chest next to eventide over and over, or traveling to every vendor to buy arrows.
                    yes sorry, I meant pedantically not contextually.
            You can do that in the cooking pot at the bizarre as well.
        ist, you can look it up online, it allows 12000 arrows of every kind in like 20 mins or so, really op
    You don't??
        Nope, keep reading and you’ll discover why bro.
    i just feel like at a certain point you have so much money it’s just easier to buy the arrows than farm them
It was *wild*? Like... like breath of.. like the breath of the...
    Yes! Exactly like *"Tears of the Kingdom"*!
I do sometimes, but it's more for the feel.
I literally dont use mine... i need to.
Durians have a tower right there,
I use the desert fairy,
Yiga hideout has an urbosa dlc shrine,
Castle is a fun run for me,
Lynels & Guardians i just ride the bike,
And I Only use Tarrey Town and Korok Forest.
    I use mine constantly. If I’m doing some side thing I’ll place it to leave and get supplies and come right back where I was. 

It’s super useful for Koroks that have you throwing rocks. If you miss just warp back and the rocks are there again. 

It has many uses.
        just walk away slightly and they (rocks) come back too!
            I was never sure how far you were to walk for it to happen. So never tried 😂 but I’ll use that next time.
                You just have to walk far enough for them to fade out. Same goes for trees. Even if you cut them down, if you walk away to the point they fade out and you come back, they'll be all back to normal.

    Nice!
mmmm thats a good way of thinking. Ive had mine there for so long never reconsidered it
    It’s nice when Lynel hunting, I’ll place it in the north be the great skeleton.
…I always used it on the way out of town
    Nah man i always teleport out of town
        I literally don't think I ever left Tarrey Town on foot. Warp to the platform and paraglide down, buy your arrows and *zoop* warp right out. No need for the bridge.
Yea it's kinda tricky, especially with double joycons. If you want to learn BLSS, first get a procon
    Nah all my money went into TotK
This is the way.
    This IS the way.
