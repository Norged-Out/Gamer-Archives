That’s bananas

        Yes.
        All of em'
Is this Zelda or Donkey Kong Country?
    DK is a Yiga Clan member confirmed.
        Master Donkey Kohga
            He's the leader of the bunch
                You know him well?
                    He’s finally back
                        To kick some tail!
                            Broke his funny car >:)
                            His coconut gun
            Donkey Koh-n-ga
        *Oooohh, ba-na-na* -DK 64
    Yes
    DK will unleash a shower of coconut cream pies if he sees this room.
Links inventory be like
    One slot of links inventory be like
I wonder if the workers have to wear a dosimeter
    Or a Geiger counter
        A dosimeter would be more important. Dosimeters measure how much radiation a worker has absorbed, which is more important than knowing how much radiation there is overall.

That said, this is kinda splitting hairs
            Oh
                Fair warning though, not an expert by any means. My diploma is from the University of 1AM Wikipedia Rabbit Holes
                    I think it's time for you to go to B.E.D.
            I think you meant splitting bananas. Or atoms.
Six foot, seven foot, eight foot BUNCH!
    Skills and charisma. Vodka with a spritzer
    daylight come and me want go home
Pretty sure this is king k rool storage
    King k tool is the banana supplier for the yiga.

            Bert be like… that’s bananas
                Bert looks like a banana.
                    How deep does the conspiracy go
                        I'm gonna say to the Hyrule Depths.
And Link could carry them all, piece of cake.
Waiting for the yiga clan to unmask and its the Kong family doing the N64 Monkey Rap.
A picture of a banana warehouse.  Human for scale.
    A picture of a Yiga member. Bananas for scale.
Someone went overboard showing the scale of that building and person.

"Ok! Ok! We get it already!"
Lol this made me laugh
Come mr tally man, tally me banana.
    Blood moon come, and me want nom nom.
Man in the photo is a "Researcher".
Should’ve known the Yiga would conspire with the UFC/Chiquita.
I'd find myself there in a random dream
Donkey Kong has entered the chat.
This is epic
They some hungry yigas
Thats alot of ripened bananas...shouldn't they be green?
I bet that room smells like banana.
    Probably of rotting ones too based on the amount of bananas that are already ripened
I see their time as Donkey Kong Country villains paid well
I imagine Donkey Kong dives into the bananas like Scrooge McDuck dives into money
    Sounds messy.

DKC flashbacks for real. Watch out for a giant flamingo
Did they steal the king horde
DK ain't gonna be happy about that.
Looks like donkey congs cave 🤣

I remember i ran into a Yiga when i still had 3 hearts. I was so confused why she was there at the very beginning. I died so fast and she had so much health my rusty broad sword was no use.

Real
That place is probably as radioactive as a nuclear reactor.
Your yiga hideout vs. the guy she told you not to worry about
POV: the math question of today
Yum
Yiga still using the duplication glitch.
Give it a couple of days and it'll be a banana bread warehouse.
Seems fitting, the Yiga are always going ape crazy on Link.
Stop underexaggerating
Banana for scale?
Heaven
Why does everyone love a clone of a clone of Skyrim???
Just wait until there is the peel mess
I'd probably slip on one and die
Would the game over text be yellow?
Donkey Kong's Banana Hoard
🍌
Calories estimate?
Donkey Kong Country looked like this once… until those damned Kremlings came along!
🎵Come Mister Tallyman, tally me banana🎵
What is the device that guy's holding in his hand?
    It's a device for tallying bananas.
