[[Cool detail I just ran across. You can see all 4 divine beasts from the top of the chimney on Link‚Äôs house.]]





This chimney always confused me there's no fire place?????????
    It's in the basement you get in that sidequest.... /s
        ah yes so BOTW2: Basement rennovation.
            The *real* From The Ground Up quest
                Wait doesnt make sense wont it be ‚ÄúFrom the Underground up‚Äù quest??
                    Or "From the ground *down*"
                        Plot twist: Ganondorf is under Link‚Äôs house
                            Ganondorf is Link‚Äòs house
                                Obligatory, "Ganondorf was the friends we made along the way."
                                    I need to look for new friends then preferably ones not trying to kill me.
                                Ganondorf is Hateno...

                Since when was there a basement option??
                    There isn't. That's a response to the poster above who joked it would be in BotW2.

What made you end up seeing this post?  Been 2 years!
                    I was just on the subreddit scrolling through the top of all time and had just gone in the well in totk so i replied. Thanks!

                                You discover new things in this game all the time. At this point there might as well be a basement I did not know about.
                                    we don‚Äôt talk about the kids I forgot about 100 years ago in there
            Sorry yes I'm joking. I would never lie like that to a fellow botw fan. Would be great though if Link had like a mancave basement with like a fishing hole and milk bar.
                Where he can crack open a few Nobel Pursuits and catch some Boom Bam Golf.

        I got so disappointed when I saw the ‚Äú/s‚Äù 	(‚ïØ_‚ï∞)
        Na you mean the shed, there is a smelting furnace in there....../s
            Oh yea, how did I forget! That's how you get the Biggoran sword!
        The one where you get the Triforce of course!
        Sshhh.  Don‚Äôt give Nintendo ideas for BoTW 2 DLC!
            Honestly when I hit send I hoped someone at Nintendo saw cuz that'd be great.
        Holy fucking shit your predicted the future
            Haha nice.
    it‚Äôs confusing bc there are other houses in hateno identical to links house, where you would see where the fireplace would be and even a small part with 3 windows... but link‚Äôs house has that part walled off and no fireplace. i tried remaking it in minecraft and was confused
        That's a great idea, remaking it in Minecraft. Now I have to try it!  Do you have a screenshot of yours?
    Houses have chimneys for the furnace, not only for fireplaces. The real question is, are there furnaces in the temperate climate of hyrule?
        Now I want to see a BotW/Stardew Valley mashup where Hyrule has seasons üò≠
        Not a chimney of that size
    You gotta get to the unicorn fountain first
    Well, the house was being taken down when you find it...maybe the previous interior had a fireplace...
    It's in Zelda's secret well

                            Don‚Äôt bother with her (yes, the user‚Äôs a girl). She‚Äôs kind of a troll. I tried reading about the stuff that she says. It just gave me a headache. It‚Äôs a lot of nonsense but at the same time, not really nonsense. I gave up in the end.
                                What‚Äôs she say?
                        Makes me wish I had read his comment

                        Good bot
        I also think it's a neat detail due to it being links house specifically
            That is the detail...
                And I'm saying that's neat
        What's cool is that you can *just barely* see a few of them.
        I want to actually throw up after reading that

Just seeing this sub makes me want to replay BOTW for the 10th time
    Same except it also makes me want to cry. Idk why, I just love this game so much
        The tones/notes of the music really evoke an emotional response from me.
            Same. Whether it be the newer tracks or the remixes of music from older games that take me back, it just works for me. In [the trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw47_q9wbBE), it was the music that sucked me in and I decided I had to have that game.  And while the music as a whole was a bit more subtle/understated than in the trailer (outside a few areas/battles) the game sure as hell didn't disappoint.
            The Hateno song is nothing short of beautiful
            Me too. Especially when you hear the slow piano overworld music and it just has those sudden minor chord drops that are just saying "everything is not all right", lol it gives me chills all the time.
Wait wait wait. There‚Äôs a chimney on Link‚Äôs house?
    Wait link has a house ?!
        Wait, who‚Äôs Link?
            The legend of link.
                The Link of Zelda.
            The person who owns the house Zelda is climbing on in this video.

            I'll do you one better: *why* is Link?
        Go and talk to the carpenters working on a house in Hateno. This will lead you to arguably the best side quest on the game, and you‚Äôll get a house too.
            Never knew this. Damn. Gonna try it out tomorrow.
                Hope you got wood ;)
                    üò≥
        Yes
            I thought he lived with Zelda?
                Pretty sure he did before because you buy this house during the game
    ‚Äú100 hours in and I didn‚Äôt know this. This game is always surprising me!‚Äù
        This sub in a nutshell
    also why? he doesn't have a fireplace
        Chimneys are not exclusively used to isolate smoke from a fireplace.
    L- link has a house in this game..?
The minimap was just trying it‚Äôs best lmao
    Lol I gave it some exercise
    Wtf, I've never noticed the minimap moves when you place trackers lol I guess I never needed it in my hundred plus hours of playing
        I never noticed either, but a lot of the time I have the minimap turned off

        Only since I bought the shield that auto-parries tho
    Maybe that's the way to finally take down Bolson who's sitting right there. Where's u/Numb3r3dDays?
        lol... If only I could get them all to fire at Bolson instead of Ganon.
This sparked my interest on where link lived before the calamity, he probably would‚Äôve lived wherever the soldiers lived before he was chosen a THE night, but after then, did he live somewhere important in the castle? Maybe close to Zelda since he was her appointed knight?

Edit: I had that question because I was thinking that it probably wasn‚Äôt an accident that those 4 areas are visible, maybe so link could see his fellow champions from his house. But that makes no sense because link got that house in botw ofc.

Edit 2: This sparked another question in me, which most likely has an answer. Do the knights in hyrule stay at their posts even in peacetime? If not this probably would‚Äôve been links house during peace time, then would‚Äôve moved somewhere closer to/in the castle so he could protect Zelda, right?
    Isn‚Äôt it hinted at that you‚Äôre buying your (links) old house?
        It is? That was a while ago so I wouldn‚Äôt know.
            Yes, but only hinted at. Someone in Bolson's crew mentions it belonged to a soldier a hundred years ago who left for service and never returned. Zelda's diary mentions Link is from the country, and Hetano is pretty remote as far as Hyrule goes.
                Ahhhhh I see
                    it was also said his hometown is hateno
                        Pretty sure that was never said. Source?
                            https://www.reddit.com/r/Breath_of_the_Wild/comments/a11rx7/creating_a_champion_links_from_hateno_and_hes_the/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share I misread, it says he's probably from there. my bad.
                            The only source I know of that actually says he might be from Hetano is a game companion book called Breath of the Wild--Creating a Champion that says Link is rumored to be from Hetano.
                        Who said this? Or where was it written?
                            https://www.reddit.com/r/Breath_of_the_Wild/comments/a11rx7/creating_a_champion_links_from_hateno_and_hes_the/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
                Not to mention the Kass side quest about the Hero's cache being at the beach outside of Hateno
                    Wasn't that from the hero 10,000 years ago?
                        Fair point! I hadn't even thought of that. A metal chest does to better underwater for 100 years opposed to 10 thousand but you may very well be right.
                Hateno is one of the largest settlements in Hyrule though...
                    Well I mean before the calamity it would have been somewhat small compared to the rest of the larger communities that were destroyed
                        I would suppose it would have been bigger, considering that they manned the wall?
                    Yeah but originally there was a major town surrounding the castle plus a series of ranches, soldier garrisons, and trading outposts in the hyrule field area. The ranches and trading outposts would have been hubs for travelers and merchants, so for a person from the castle, any settlement outside of the hyrule castle region would be more countryside.
            I‚Äôm pretty sure there was some dialogue that said the house was suddenly abandoned after the war/event (however they call it, haven‚Äôt played the game in a while) and it‚Äôs implied that Link was the previous owner
                I think it‚Äôs a conversation you can have with Bolson and crew that the house was abandoned after a boy left to be a knight 100 years ago and they‚Äôre about to tear it down if it wasn‚Äôt for Link buying it back.
                Wait, I thought Hateno was used as a safe haven for people during the Calamity? Someone (idr who, I think Impa?) said it was one of the most untouched towns in Hyrule and was used to stay safe from the Calamity's monsters while it went on?
                    Might‚Äôve been the most untouched area/region but i personally wouldn‚Äôt call it a safehaven, even then it‚Äôs not impossible for them to say that the house belongs to a soldier and they won‚Äôt sell it to newcomers for the small chance that the soldier would come back after a while. Given enough time people who had survived the calamity would‚Äôve already build new houses and that one stayed as a relic/reminder to the past
        I don't remember anything like that in BotW, but I feel like Age of Calamity probably hints at it being Link's own house during that era too
        Yes, very heavily hinted at.
    It's mentioned by the bolson crew that the home has been abandoned for some time, and that the previous owner left for military service and never returned. May or may not be link, but at least was a brother in arms that died during the great calamity.
    He probably still lived with the other royal guards even after becoming the champion.
    Link got the house before botw, too. It was sitting for 100 years bc the previous owner abandoned it. Since you can't, you know, occupy a house while you're in a coma.
    Idk much about Zelda lore but don‚Äôt link and Zelda share a bed in one game
        No. There is one where Link visits a prostitute though.
            Zelda 2 for NES? I think I remember that being where you heal, but it's loosely implied to be a prostitute.
                Bingo. And you could say heavily implied. The callback in BOTW with the spa treatment was not introduced as "please let me help you. Come inside."
                    Come inside you say?

Do they have the pill in Hyrule?
                        Well, how do you think the Hero genes get passed on? Zelda is from a continuous bloodline of royals, Link is from a continuous bloodline of...

Though you have to bring water in order for the lady to let you (sic) in so I guess she used the old timey way.
            And got the *deluxe* spa treatment...
        Not in game, but I'm sure it's pretty safe to say after the game in only SS. 

I mean, childhood friends, deep shared experiences, Link saved Zelda from Ghirahim and Demise, and lots of bonding time after on top of a preexisting close friendship? I'd be *highly* surprised if they relationship in that game didn't get much more personal after the end.
This is actually amazing
I would love it so much if in that cut scene, the Champions aim the Divine Beasts wrong and accidentally obliterate Link‚Äôs house and do zero damage to Ganon.
The distance render in this game is nuts
It still erks me that they put two beasts in the north east and none in the south east. Like come on, how you gonna have the largest open world (at the time) with 4 main landmarks and not put them in the 4 corners of the world?
    Wasn't there some talk about lurelin village having been a spot for a divine beast but that got scrapped for some reason..? I think..?
        I have no idea. My best guess is they were trying to remain semi-accurate regarding the geography relative to the older games. Back in oot death mountain and Zora's domain were both to the east of Hyrule castle (assuming facing the castle head on is north). Although, gerudo valley was north west so it kinda falls apart
            Hm that's interesting thats cool if it's even a little bit how they placed things haha
Exceptionally cool find!
The detail in this game never ceases to amaze.
I bet the guy who thought that up is in tears, glad that someone finally recognised their genius
Will the cool discoveries of this legendary game ever end?
Someone convince me to play this game for the first time, it seems overwhelming
    BoTW in no way is overwhelming, the huge world given to you is so peaceful and relaxing, and the only thing I find overwhelming is how the developers created such an expansive world, it almost sees unreal the amount of details compact into it. The game at its start gave me extreme cases of nostalgia looks back on it, it creates such an amazing atmosphere at the beginning, and exploring and learning how to survive and create your own methods of battle and exploration surely adds to the game. Almost every screenshot feels like it can be painted, and the story itself is immersive. If you like games for the battle, the bosses, main quests, and other monsters have you covered. It‚Äôs extremely well done to explore, and I 100% recommend it.
        Ok you convinced me to give it a shot lol. My favorite game growing up was ocarina of time, I‚Äôd just heard Botw was tedious
            Also, one of the few games where I feel the DLC is actually worth the money. It's almost cheap compared to what you actually get from it
                Also very true!
            Don't look anything up, just explore & try things. If you go in blind and get immersed in its world & the sense of adventure, it is truly a masterwork. It captures the same feel original LoZ did where you're plopped into a world and pushed off the edge into it - but with all the modern QoL fixins'
            I shot a Lynel with an ancient arrow
        Wish i could play it on my pc
    It is the truest form of ‚Äúat your own pace‚Äù. It is such a wonderfully executed game. I got the switch for this game. It was worth every penny, every hour, and every ‚ÄúWhoa‚Äù I had in my experience. Truly a gem.
    It does, not gonna lie, but at the same time, you take it at your pace. That‚Äôs the great thing about this game - you don‚Äôt have to spend hours playing, you can set goals for yourself and do as little or as much as you like in one sitting. The above is true too - the game is relaxing and peaceful and as you explore, you learn what works for you and what doesn‚Äôt. If you don‚Äôt want to take on every single enemy camp you find, you don‚Äôt have too. If you don‚Äôt feel ready to take on the sub bosses at a particular time, awesome, you don‚Äôt have to do that either - you can wait, practice and come back when you feel stronger. I was at 500ish hours when I finished the main storyline and this was the first Zelda game I actually did that with - I played Ocarina of Time and I had finished up to the Shadow Temple when my save data got corrupted. Twilight Princess I got to the palace of twilight and the stupid get the sols thing annoyed me so much I never finished. This game, because your not locked into a sense of you gotta do this thing for that thing (unless for a particular mission), if something doesn‚Äôt work for you, you can do other parts of the story or side quests or whatever and come back. It‚Äôs actually sort of freeing in a way. If that makes sense.
    I looked at this subreddit a lot before getting it and I felt the same but just forget about that, the game is so insanely open ended you can take everything at your own pace, hell you don't even have to do almost anything you don't want to do. I took my sweet ass time, by the time I beat the final boss it was a joke because I was so powerful lol
Hateno villages theme just makes me feel sum bro, like just an overall serene feeling.
    Hateno and Kakariko... Something about them and their themes makes them feel like home for me.
        Agree. I'm at 485 hours on my main save, not much more to do... but flying from the Hateno Lab to Link's house at night is the best. With all blue flame lanterns lit.

The music of Kakariko is outstanding. Flying down into town from the Fairy Fountain at night... wearing full stealth gear... picking up the Sneaky River Snails from the small pond by the water wheel...

The art direction of the game lends it nearly infinite replayability; I'll probably still fire it up when my kids have kids.
            I just started again after 300 hours :D totally didnt know how i could keep old save ...
                Yeah you just need to create another profile on your switch (or wii u)
            > With all blue flame lanterns lit.

Having just started a new save I saw this and instantly thought oh god fuck those stupid quests
            Why the hell do all the sneaky animals glow in the dark???
                Bioluminescence. Lots of animals have it irl. Or perhaps they absorb chemicals from Luminous Stones.

Man there's so much cool stuff that glows in the game.

Night time is the right time.
                    Yeah no I know why they glow but why do the sneaky animals make themselves not sneaky?
            Agreed - I've long since finished the story and sidequests, but I love booting up BotW just to ride around on my horse. It's just a game like no other, in my humble experience.
        https://youtu.be/alv1BKFjBvQ

There's a 10 hour video for each city/area
            Thanks mate. Think I'll be sleeping very soundly tonight.
        Probably very much on purpose.
        Lurelin, too! The music is so serene
    It‚Äôs the fact that Hateno is the last real central safe haven for most Hylians after their original capital got glassed.
    It‚Äôs gotta be the safety that comes with it. From a game standpoint, you can be absolutely sure that no Guardians or Bokobbles or whatever are hiding in the bushes. Sure, in the, and I am stealing the term from Pok√©mon cause it actually works better here, vast majority of the Wild area, you won‚Äôt run into them there either, but you can never feel so *sure*. Even in the Guardian Graveyard, where it tells us in a cutscene that, ‚ÄúHey, Zelda killed ALL of these dumbasses and they are DEAD dead.‚Äù You still feel as though one might spring to life as they have in so many other areas.

From a lore standpoint though, Hateno is a sort of bastion for the Hylians. A shield against the Calamity. It is safety, it is security. A lot of the survivors of the Calamity either went to Kakariko or Hateno, so for them it means peace.
    The whole game is a work of art
    Tarry town is my favorite
Worth getting a switch just to play this or what.? I keep hearing good things
    Yes.
    Depends on your disposable income lol but I will say it‚Äôs in the top 3 games I‚Äôve ever played.
    It‚Äôs a masterpiece, you won‚Äôt be disappointed ‚ò∫Ô∏è
        Yep. I got it. Took a few days to adjust as I‚Äôm coming off competitive FPS‚Ä¶aaand I love it. It‚Äôs awesome <3
            It‚Äôs taken over my life and ruined all other games for me lmao!
                The ability to just play for 5 minutes or 5 hours is so nice. I forgot you can play video games without being stressed out, and now I‚Äôm staring at digital sunsets and smiling. Hate to make such an easy pun, but it‚Äôs often breathtaking.
                    And if you need a bit of stress there‚Äôs always the Trial of the Sword üëçüèº
No, im not gonna play this game for a 4th time, stop showing up on my frontpage.
No wonder they‚Äôre taking this long on the sequel
    I say let em take their time, drop another banger on us
Every Beast, and therefore champion is taking watch/ aim at the castle/Ganon. Link from his house it‚Äôs the fifth.
Whenever I think every detail in BotW has been found I am proven wrong and *I love it*
This game is so ridiculously good for so many small reasons.
    Had no idea there was even a house you could buy. I want to beat this game so bad but the durability thing (and a few of those physics puzzles) just kills this game for me. Beaten every other zelda game. God I hope they adjust it remove it in the next one or I'm gonna be crushed.
        I'm surprised durability is such a big deal to people. I have way more weapons then I actually need; I can't break them fast enough.
        > the durability thing

Weapons are so easy to find though. I never really got this argument because keeping a constant stock is insanely easy. 

> physics puzzles

A couple of the motion control ones are a bit frustrating, yeah. Most have workarounds thankfully.
now where's that bitchass ganon

    good game

great game

incredible game

literally my favorite game of all time

#p l a y   i t
    Hi! Yes, I can actually say this was the first Zelda game I played start to finish. Got the same sensation as the first time I played Skyrim, and I would now firmly put this game above that.
    For sure. They entirely reinvented the whole game and knocked it out of the park. I play some zeldas, not all, this game is just so amazingly well done
Wow Nintendo must have been collecting ideas for years to dump them into BotW. The amount of hidden details is just out of this world wtf.
That‚Äôs fucking awesome!
that looks so cool!
Damn I gotta fight those?
    They're more like dungeons. You do have to fight things inside them tho
Even at home, Link can't forget. ;n;
No freaking way!
This game just continually amazes me
This is easily one of my favorite subreddits!
Man, I should finish this game
    Absolutely
Well, f*ck my ass and call me Revali
    Err, it‚Äôs actually Ravioli üòÇ
I think Calamity Ganon can see all 4 Devine beast from his house as well!
I was wondering if it's possible to see all four from one location, this answered.  Thanks!
I Just Love this far Vision sooo much
That‚Äôs awesome! Definitely doesn‚Äôt seem like an accident that hateno has that vantage points
Ok, this is a cool find
That‚Äôs amazing
That IS cool!
Noice
a perfect place to keep watch, as the hero of hyrule
Ahhh that is so cool! I‚Äôm still loving this game
The ultimate madlad, these Godzilla beast are within eyeshot. Let‚Äôs set up here.
Link has a house?
    It's in hateno you get it through the hylian homeowner quest
    It is implied that it is his original house from 100 years ago where Link's sister and father lived, before he became a Knight at Hyrule Castle
That‚Äôs awesome, but why do you have motion controls turned off, they‚Äôre an awesome addition personally.
Oh man. I miss this song.
Meanwhile me who noticed this in game and best it got out of me was "oh cool i see them all" and now im feeling some what jealous how much one can appreciate small detail like this and see it difrently :D
Does anyone know if there are any places you can see more than one dragon at once? Do their spawning times even overlap?
The violins in this village music always gets me! It's so beautiful.
Wow
Wow nice fuckin find!!
That's extremely cool. I had no idea!
[deleted]
     Such a good game.
Truly a place he can call home
I HAVE A HOUSE?
Link has a house!??
    Yeah through a side quest you can buy a house and then you can cause a new town to be built in the northeast. I think you start it by talking to construction dudes near hateno
Link has a house?
    You can buy one in one of the side quests!
        There‚Äôs so much in this game. Thank you.
Link has a house?? Where?
    You can buy one in one of the side quests in Hateno Village!
Where is this?
    Edge of Hateno village
no way‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶how did the devs plan/build this?!
Ganon can also see all the divine beasts targeting his ass from the castle
I love watching the minimap go crazy trying to catch up with the markers
oh man.. every time I see a post of this subreddit it always makes me want to play botw again.. this game truly was one of the best experiences I ever had in gaming!
Links minimap go brrrr
all these years and this game is still blowing me away.
BOTW is a legendary game
I can‚Äôt even find the 4 sprit things. Game is too hard!!
I really have to get this game back I traded mine for smash ultimate
    *I really have to*

*Get this game back I traded mine*

How do you record your gameplay
    Press and hold the capture button and it will save the last 30 seconds.
        Any way on how to make a full gameplay?
            No sorry, you‚Äôd need a capture card for that.
        Ah
Today I learned that Link has a house in this game.
I always clear Vah Rutah first because fuck rainstorms.
Nice.
You can actually see all four from hyrule castle!
Edit: /s
    Well yeah, how else would they shoot ganon
That's very cool! I'm going to try it. But I have a feeling they are usually not all visible at the same instant like this since I usually don't see either on Fire Mt. Only once in a while. But I didn't know you could see the other two locations from Link's house at all.
    This is after all 4 have been beaten and are in position.
        Ah! It's still cool. But I guess I won't be seeing them for a while, then...
            I shot a Lynel with an ancient arrow
        Had no idea there was even a house you could buy. I want to beat this game so bad but the durability thing (and a few of those physics puzzles) just kills this game for me. Beaten every other zelda game. God I hope they adjust it remove it in the next one or I'm gonna be crushed.
            Don't worry about the weapons, they come aplenty and it gets easier and easier. Don't even let it stress you, and the game is so worth it
The only thing I noticed is your perfectly-fine-controller with no drift whatsoever...
Lucky bastard...
    Electrical contact cleaner, spray some in your joycons move em around a bit and let dry. Perm fix to drift.
        If it's so permenant then why doesn't Nintendo just add that step to the assembly line?
            It's not permanent. That part of the statement is bullshit.
                I've had my og switch controllers since launch, drift happened after a year and they've been fine since. Never heard of anyone using this trick having to do it again.
                    And what is the cause of this drift? Dust right?
        Nope
            Yep. Don't know what to tell ya bud, but it works. Og switch controllers bought on day one work like new
                Yes and many more people tried this out and it doesn't work. Some drifts are more severe than others and can't be easily repaired like that
    I‚Äôve had 2 out of 5 joycons go out on me (yes I bought one of the single ones). üôÑ
    Can‚Äôt you just send them to a repair center for free?

I sent 4 in for repair and they were back in like a week
        I live in Egypt and Nintendo isn't really available here...
Even something as simple as the Nintendo eshop isn't available...
    We got a wired controller for this reason. /sigh
How come we don't see their lasers?
    the lasers are harder to see against the sky from far away at daytime. you can juust barely see them in this clip, the one that‚Äôs most visible is overlaid against the landscape.
Are you using Cemu?
How on earth did you figure this out?
    I had a stroke. 

Of genius.
Nice!
I feel like an idiot in that I never really had the realization that those were the chimneys of those houses.
    In your defense, I don't think link's house even has a fireplace..?
What‚Äôs Zelda doing on top of Links house anyway?üòÜ
Is the world really small or something?
    Not at all, it's huge, and idk why that guy said its flat lol, it's not. Hence why this post is notable
        Makes sense, those must be pretty big creatures if the games map is large!
    No, but it is flat
Ok but there‚Äôs many spots where you can do this.
I‚Äôm in the Southern East-coast USA

You can also se them all from the castle though they do look quite a bit more threatening
Tbh even the first time I watched the cutscene, I was laughing like "this fish lady thirsty asf" literally no sadness
    Wait wrong post nvm
I would like this game a lot more if it was on a more powerful system and could run upwards of 60fps.
    I‚Äôd like you a lot more if you posted interesting comments.
This is true for many places in Hyrule, not to be that guy.
to be fair that's not the only place...
you can see the same goddamn thing from any high place in hyrule...
    If only you‚Äôd been here two days ago to convince everyone this was boring, then you wouldn‚Äôt be so frustrated!
        It's not just boring, it's fucking stupid. I think you'd be able to see the whole solar system from a fucking telescope on pluto if you went there but nobody's making articles about that because it's FUCKING OBVIOUS. NO SHIT YOU CAN SEE ALL OF HYRULE FROM ONE OF THE HIGHEST POINTS ON THE CORNER OF THE GODDAMN MAP.
            It must be so maddening to know that so many other people found this interesting.
                Because everyone is stupid. Especially OP themself. This is uninteresting and completely fucking obvious. The fact that this got a fucking article written about it shows how stupid people are. Wow, who the fuck knew you could see more things if you went to a higher vantage point!!! NO FUCKING WAY!!!
                    lol this is the most Redditor comment I've ever seen in my life.
                        They don‚Äôt realize they‚Äôve been replying to the OP (me) this whole time, and they also apparently think this chimney is higher than the fucking volcano. üòÑ
                    Well you‚Äôve been talking to the OP (me) this whole time, and I‚Äôm just still not getting it. Maybe if you try a few more messages in all caps, I‚Äôll understand how stupid I am. üòÑ
                        no duh, shithole. gee, I wonder who OP is. Maybe it's the guy with the big OP logo right next to his name, and with his head shoved so far up his ass he can hurl double the uninteresting, mundane and boring bullshit from his fucking mouth.
                            Damn I wish I could be there to see your reaction to this second article. https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/04/random_links_breath_of_the_wild_house_is_set_in_a_surprisingly_divine_location
                                Is this supposed to prove something?
    oh my fucking god there's an article... this is fucking stupid. THIS IS NOT VERY INTERESTING OR COOL, YOU CAN SEE THE SAME GODDAMN FUCKING THING FROM ANY HIGH POINT ON THE FUCKING MAP ARE YOU DAFT?????
        Are you okay? Maybe take a few deep breaths...

SYMBOLISM IN STORYTELLING!!!

What game is this ( I‚Äôm sure there are different legend of Zelda games)
    Breath of the wild (sub name haha). Definitely recommend if you haven‚Äôt tried it!
There are no accidents.
map just casually having a seizure
Now the question is do the developers know this shot or do u get lucky noticing?  Either way it is amazing.
any way to play this on PC?

Am I the only noticing for the first time how the HUD map changes depending on the telescope thing? 

I turned it off within like an hour of playing so I never noticed.
4 years later and I just learned there's a scope
WOW
Probably easier to see when they're all completed.
Wow. That has to be a very well planned out easter egg...
Man I regret rushing this game. Something about playing games makes me anxious. Like I should be doing something more important like plying with my kids. The wonders of gaming gone... for now. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll get into games soon and I‚Äôll be able to play guilt free.
I constantly forget that Hateno Village and Zora‚Äôs Domain are so close together holy cow
I also realised and took a photo too
Ugh, I want a switch.

Been trying to wait out scammers to buy an Animal Crossing LE Switch and they keep swiping them before me, or I'm spent when I *can* catch one. BotW has been on my bucket list since AC got my hyped for the console.
    I got my AC switch using nowinstock.net and but it took a few days for one to become available. I wasnt looking for that particular model but I like owning unique things so since it didnt cost me a penny more I couldnt say no. Ordered it off gamestop

But yeah, try that site out.
        I sure will! Thank you
The fact that details KEEP emerging from this game is incredible
    *The fact that details*

Wait.... Link has a house? I played through the entire game and didn‚Äôt get Link a house?
    So you didn't make the village that you can get after buying the house?
        Nope. Guess I got to play again.
I‚Äôm sorry link has a house?!
    Yes haha you can buy one in a side quest in Hateno village
Which one do I go to first? Left or right?
Where is this?

actually very cool
You can see all 4 beasts from the top of hyrule castle

                            You discover new things in this game all the time. At this point there might as well be a basement I did not know about.
                                we don‚Äôt talk about the kids I forgot about 100 years ago in there
        Sorry yes I'm joking. I would never lie like that to a fellow botw fan. Would be great though if Link had like a mancave basement with like a fishing hole and milk bar.
            Where he can crack open a few Nobel Pursuits and catch some Boom Bam Golf.

    Sshhh.  Don‚Äôt give Nintendo ideas for BoTW 2 DLC!
        Honestly when I hit send I hoped someone at Nintendo saw cuz that'd be great.
    Holy fucking shit your predicted the future
        Haha nice.
it‚Äôs confusing bc there are other houses in hateno identical to links house, where you would see where the fireplace would be and even a small part with 3 windows... but link‚Äôs house has that part walled off and no fireplace. i tried remaking it in minecraft and was confused
    That's a great idea, remaking it in Minecraft. Now I have to try it!  Do you have a screenshot of yours?
Houses have chimneys for the furnace, not only for fireplaces. The real question is, are there furnaces in the temperate climate of hyrule?
    Now I want to see a BotW/Stardew Valley mashup where Hyrule has seasons üò≠
    Not a chimney of that size
You gotta get to the unicorn fountain first
Well, the house was being taken down when you find it...maybe the previous interior had a fireplace...
It's in Zelda's secret well

                        Don‚Äôt bother with her (yes, the user‚Äôs a girl). She‚Äôs kind of a troll. I tried reading about the stuff that she says. It just gave me a headache. It‚Äôs a lot of nonsense but at the same time, not really nonsense. I gave up in the end.
                            What‚Äôs she say?
                    Makes me wish I had read his comment
                Someone made her a subreddit. Check out r/shutupbrad if you want to go into that foxhole
                    Haha
                Seems to be a downvote farmer from recent comment history
                    Oh yeah , I never get how these people have so much karma
            Trolls man. Not very funny.
            I have no idea what you‚Äôre trying to say in the last half. Complete word salad
            please get a new joke
            Bad bot
                Are you sure about that? Because I am 99.99965% sure that YouSeeWhereBradAt is not a bot.

    I also think it's a neat detail due to it being links house specifically
        That is the detail...
            And I'm saying that's neat
    What's cool is that you can *just barely* see a few of them.
    I want to actually throw up after reading that
What‚Äôs really nice is being able to set multiple markers on a map
Same except it also makes me want to cry. Idk why, I just love this game so much
    The tones/notes of the music really evoke an emotional response from me.
        Same. Whether it be the newer tracks or the remixes of music from older games that take me back, it just works for me. In [the trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw47_q9wbBE), it was the music that sucked me in and I decided I had to have that game.  And while the music as a whole was a bit more subtle/understated than in the trailer (outside a few areas/battles) the game sure as hell didn't disappoint.
        The Hateno song is nothing short of beautiful
        Me too. Especially when you hear the slow piano overworld music and it just has those sudden minor chord drops that are just saying "everything is not all right", lol it gives me chills all the time.
Wait link has a house ?!
    Wait, who‚Äôs Link?
        The legend of link.
            The Link of Zelda.
        The person who owns the house Zelda is climbing on in this video.
            Wait, what's a house?!

        He‚Äôs Zelda
        I'll do you one better: *why* is Link?
    Go and talk to the carpenters working on a house in Hateno. This will lead you to arguably the best side quest on the game, and you‚Äôll get a house too.
        Never knew this. Damn. Gonna try it out tomorrow.
            Hope you got wood ;)
                üò≥
    Yes
        I thought he lived with Zelda?
            Pretty sure he did before because you buy this house during the game
‚Äú100 hours in and I didn‚Äôt know this. This game is always surprising me!‚Äù
    This sub in a nutshell
also why? he doesn't have a fireplace
    Chimneys are not exclusively used to isolate smoke from a fireplace.
L- link has a house in this game..?
Lol I gave it some exercise
Wtf, I've never noticed the minimap moves when you place trackers lol I guess I never needed it in my hundred plus hours of playing
    I never noticed either, but a lot of the time I have the minimap turned off
>trying it is best

    Only since I bought the shield that auto-parries tho
Maybe that's the way to finally take down Bolson who's sitting right there. Where's u/Numb3r3dDays?
    lol... If only I could get them all to fire at Bolson instead of Ganon.
Isn‚Äôt it hinted at that you‚Äôre buying your (links) old house?
    It is? That was a while ago so I wouldn‚Äôt know.
        Yes, but only hinted at. Someone in Bolson's crew mentions it belonged to a soldier a hundred years ago who left for service and never returned. Zelda's diary mentions Link is from the country, and Hetano is pretty remote as far as Hyrule goes.
            Ahhhhh I see
                it was also said his hometown is hateno
                    Pretty sure that was never said. Source?
                        https://www.reddit.com/r/Breath_of_the_Wild/comments/a11rx7/creating_a_champion_links_from_hateno_and_hes_the/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share I misread, it says he's probably from there. my bad.
                        The only source I know of that actually says he might be from Hetano is a game companion book called Breath of the Wild--Creating a Champion that says Link is rumored to be from Hetano.
                    Who said this? Or where was it written?
                        https://www.reddit.com/r/Breath_of_the_Wild/comments/a11rx7/creating_a_champion_links_from_hateno_and_hes_the/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
            Not to mention the Kass side quest about the Hero's cache being at the beach outside of Hateno
                Wasn't that from the hero 10,000 years ago?
                    Fair point! I hadn't even thought of that. A metal chest does to better underwater for 100 years opposed to 10 thousand but you may very well be right.
            Hateno is one of the largest settlements in Hyrule though...
                Well I mean before the calamity it would have been somewhat small compared to the rest of the larger communities that were destroyed
                    I would suppose it would have been bigger, considering that they manned the wall?
                Yeah but originally there was a major town surrounding the castle plus a series of ranches, soldier garrisons, and trading outposts in the hyrule field area. The ranches and trading outposts would have been hubs for travelers and merchants, so for a person from the castle, any settlement outside of the hyrule castle region would be more countryside.
        I‚Äôm pretty sure there was some dialogue that said the house was suddenly abandoned after the war/event (however they call it, haven‚Äôt played the game in a while) and it‚Äôs implied that Link was the previous owner
            I think it‚Äôs a conversation you can have with Bolson and crew that the house was abandoned after a boy left to be a knight 100 years ago and they‚Äôre about to tear it down if it wasn‚Äôt for Link buying it back.
            Wait, I thought Hateno was used as a safe haven for people during the Calamity? Someone (idr who, I think Impa?) said it was one of the most untouched towns in Hyrule and was used to stay safe from the Calamity's monsters while it went on?
                Might‚Äôve been the most untouched area/region but i personally wouldn‚Äôt call it a safehaven, even then it‚Äôs not impossible for them to say that the house belongs to a soldier and they won‚Äôt sell it to newcomers for the small chance that the soldier would come back after a while. Given enough time people who had survived the calamity would‚Äôve already build new houses and that one stayed as a relic/reminder to the past
    I don't remember anything like that in BotW, but I feel like Age of Calamity probably hints at it being Link's own house during that era too
    Yes, very heavily hinted at.
It's mentioned by the bolson crew that the home has been abandoned for some time, and that the previous owner left for military service and never returned. May or may not be link, but at least was a brother in arms that died during the great calamity.
He probably still lived with the other royal guards even after becoming the champion.
Link got the house before botw, too. It was sitting for 100 years bc the previous owner abandoned it. Since you can't, you know, occupy a house while you're in a coma.
Idk much about Zelda lore but don‚Äôt link and Zelda share a bed in one game
    No. There is one where Link visits a prostitute though.
        Zelda 2 for NES? I think I remember that being where you heal, but it's loosely implied to be a prostitute.
            Bingo. And you could say heavily implied. The callback in BOTW with the spa treatment was not introduced as "please let me help you. Come inside."
                Come inside you say?

Do they have the pill in Hyrule?
                    Well, how do you think the Hero genes get passed on? Zelda is from a continuous bloodline of royals, Link is from a continuous bloodline of...

Though you have to bring water in order for the lady to let you (sic) in so I guess she used the old timey way.
        And got the *deluxe* spa treatment...
    Not in game, but I'm sure it's pretty safe to say after the game in only SS. 

I mean, childhood friends, deep shared experiences, Link saved Zelda from Ghirahim and Demise, and lots of bonding time after on top of a preexisting close friendship? I'd be *highly* surprised if they relationship in that game didn't get much more personal after the end.
Wasn't there some talk about lurelin village having been a spot for a divine beast but that got scrapped for some reason..? I think..?
    I have no idea. My best guess is they were trying to remain semi-accurate regarding the geography relative to the older games. Back in oot death mountain and Zora's domain were both to the east of Hyrule castle (assuming facing the castle head on is north). Although, gerudo valley was north west so it kinda falls apart
        Hm that's interesting thats cool if it's even a little bit how they placed things haha
BoTW in no way is overwhelming, the huge world given to you is so peaceful and relaxing, and the only thing I find overwhelming is how the developers created such an expansive world, it almost sees unreal the amount of details compact into it. The game at its start gave me extreme cases of nostalgia looks back on it, it creates such an amazing atmosphere at the beginning, and exploring and learning how to survive and create your own methods of battle and exploration surely adds to the game. Almost every screenshot feels like it can be painted, and the story itself is immersive. If you like games for the battle, the bosses, main quests, and other monsters have you covered. It‚Äôs extremely well done to explore, and I 100% recommend it.
    Ok you convinced me to give it a shot lol. My favorite game growing up was ocarina of time, I‚Äôd just heard Botw was tedious
        Also, one of the few games where I feel the DLC is actually worth the money. It's almost cheap compared to what you actually get from it
            Also very true!
        Don't look anything up, just explore & try things. If you go in blind and get immersed in its world & the sense of adventure, it is truly a masterwork. It captures the same feel original LoZ did where you're plopped into a world and pushed off the edge into it - but with all the modern QoL fixins'
        I shot a Lynel with an ancient arrow
    Wish i could play it on my pc
It is the truest form of ‚Äúat your own pace‚Äù. It is such a wonderfully executed game. I got the switch for this game. It was worth every penny, every hour, and every ‚ÄúWhoa‚Äù I had in my experience. Truly a gem.
It does, not gonna lie, but at the same time, you take it at your pace. That‚Äôs the great thing about this game - you don‚Äôt have to spend hours playing, you can set goals for yourself and do as little or as much as you like in one sitting. The above is true too - the game is relaxing and peaceful and as you explore, you learn what works for you and what doesn‚Äôt. If you don‚Äôt want to take on every single enemy camp you find, you don‚Äôt have too. If you don‚Äôt feel ready to take on the sub bosses at a particular time, awesome, you don‚Äôt have to do that either - you can wait, practice and come back when you feel stronger. I was at 500ish hours when I finished the main storyline and this was the first Zelda game I actually did that with - I played Ocarina of Time and I had finished up to the Shadow Temple when my save data got corrupted. Twilight Princess I got to the palace of twilight and the stupid get the sols thing annoyed me so much I never finished. This game, because your not locked into a sense of you gotta do this thing for that thing (unless for a particular mission), if something doesn‚Äôt work for you, you can do other parts of the story or side quests or whatever and come back. It‚Äôs actually sort of freeing in a way. If that makes sense.
I looked at this subreddit a lot before getting it and I felt the same but just forget about that, the game is so insanely open ended you can take everything at your own pace, hell you don't even have to do almost anything you don't want to do. I took my sweet ass time, by the time I beat the final boss it was a joke because I was so powerful lol
Hateno and Kakariko... Something about them and their themes makes them feel like home for me.
    Agree. I'm at 485 hours on my main save, not much more to do... but flying from the Hateno Lab to Link's house at night is the best. With all blue flame lanterns lit.

The music of Kakariko is outstanding. Flying down into town from the Fairy Fountain at night... wearing full stealth gear... picking up the Sneaky River Snails from the small pond by the water wheel...

The art direction of the game lends it nearly infinite replayability; I'll probably still fire it up when my kids have kids.
        I just started again after 300 hours :D totally didnt know how i could keep old save ...
            Yeah you just need to create another profile on your switch (or wii u)
        > With all blue flame lanterns lit.

Having just started a new save I saw this and instantly thought oh god fuck those stupid quests
        Why the hell do all the sneaky animals glow in the dark???
            Bioluminescence. Lots of animals have it irl. Or perhaps they absorb chemicals from Luminous Stones.

Man there's so much cool stuff that glows in the game.

Night time is the right time.
                Yeah no I know why they glow but why do the sneaky animals make themselves not sneaky?
        Agreed - I've long since finished the story and sidequests, but I love booting up BotW just to ride around on my horse. It's just a game like no other, in my humble experience.
    https://youtu.be/alv1BKFjBvQ

There's a 10 hour video for each city/area
        Thanks mate. Think I'll be sleeping very soundly tonight.
    Probably very much on purpose.
    Lurelin, too! The music is so serene
It‚Äôs the fact that Hateno is the last real central safe haven for most Hylians after their original capital got glassed.
It‚Äôs gotta be the safety that comes with it. From a game standpoint, you can be absolutely sure that no Guardians or Bokobbles or whatever are hiding in the bushes. Sure, in the, and I am stealing the term from Pok√©mon cause it actually works better here, vast majority of the Wild area, you won‚Äôt run into them there either, but you can never feel so *sure*. Even in the Guardian Graveyard, where it tells us in a cutscene that, ‚ÄúHey, Zelda killed ALL of these dumbasses and they are DEAD dead.‚Äù You still feel as though one might spring to life as they have in so many other areas.

From a lore standpoint though, Hateno is a sort of bastion for the Hylians. A shield against the Calamity. It is safety, it is security. A lot of the survivors of the Calamity either went to Kakariko or Hateno, so for them it means peace.
The whole game is a work of art
Tarry town is my favorite
Yes.
Depends on your disposable income lol but I will say it‚Äôs in the top 3 games I‚Äôve ever played.
It‚Äôs a masterpiece, you won‚Äôt be disappointed ‚ò∫Ô∏è
    Yep. I got it. Took a few days to adjust as I‚Äôm coming off competitive FPS‚Ä¶aaand I love it. It‚Äôs awesome <3
        It‚Äôs taken over my life and ruined all other games for me lmao!
            The ability to just play for 5 minutes or 5 hours is so nice. I forgot you can play video games without being stressed out, and now I‚Äôm staring at digital sunsets and smiling. Hate to make such an easy pun, but it‚Äôs often breathtaking.
                And if you need a bit of stress there‚Äôs always the Trial of the Sword üëçüèº
I say let em take their time, drop another banger on us
Had no idea there was even a house you could buy. I want to beat this game so bad but the durability thing (and a few of those physics puzzles) just kills this game for me. Beaten every other zelda game. God I hope they adjust it remove it in the next one or I'm gonna be crushed.
    I'm surprised durability is such a big deal to people. I have way more weapons then I actually need; I can't break them fast enough.
    > the durability thing

Weapons are so easy to find though. I never really got this argument because keeping a constant stock is insanely easy. 

> physics puzzles

A couple of the motion control ones are a bit frustrating, yeah. Most have workarounds thankfully.
good game

great game

incredible game

literally my favorite game of all time

#p l a y   i t
Hi! Yes, I can actually say this was the first Zelda game I played start to finish. Got the same sensation as the first time I played Skyrim, and I would now firmly put this game above that.
For sure. They entirely reinvented the whole game and knocked it out of the park. I play some zeldas, not all, this game is just so amazingly well done
They're more like dungeons. You do have to fight things inside them tho
Absolutely
Err, it‚Äôs actually Ravioli üòÇ
It's in hateno you get it through the hylian homeowner quest
It is implied that it is his original house from 100 years ago where Link's sister and father lived, before he became a Knight at Hyrule Castle
 Such a good game.
Yeah through a side quest you can buy a house and then you can cause a new town to be built in the northeast. I think you start it by talking to construction dudes near hateno
You can buy one in one of the side quests!
    There‚Äôs so much in this game. Thank you.
You can buy one in one of the side quests in Hateno Village!

Electrical contact cleaner, spray some in your joycons move em around a bit and let dry. Perm fix to drift.
    If it's so permenant then why doesn't Nintendo just add that step to the assembly line?
        It's not permanent. That part of the statement is bullshit.
            I've had my og switch controllers since launch, drift happened after a year and they've been fine since. Never heard of anyone using this trick having to do it again.
                And what is the cause of this drift? Dust right?
    Nope
        Yep. Don't know what to tell ya bud, but it works. Og switch controllers bought on day one work like new
            Yes and many more people tried this out and it doesn't work. Some drifts are more severe than others and can't be easily repaired like that
I‚Äôve had 2 out of 5 joycons go out on me (yes I bought one of the single ones). üôÑ
Can‚Äôt you just send them to a repair center for free?

I sent 4 in for repair and they were back in like a week

Not at all, it's huge, and idk why that guy said its flat lol, it's not. Hence why this post is notable
    Makes sense, those must be pretty big creatures if the games map is large!
No, but it is flat
Wait wrong post nvm
I‚Äôd like you a lot more if you posted interesting comments.
If only you‚Äôd been here two days ago to convince everyone this was boring, then you wouldn‚Äôt be so frustrated!
    It's not just boring, it's fucking stupid. I think you'd be able to see the whole solar system from a fucking telescope on pluto if you went there but nobody's making articles about that because it's FUCKING OBVIOUS. NO SHIT YOU CAN SEE ALL OF HYRULE FROM ONE OF THE HIGHEST POINTS ON THE CORNER OF THE GODDAMN MAP.
        It must be so maddening to know that so many other people found this interesting.
            Because everyone is stupid. Especially OP themself. This is uninteresting and completely fucking obvious. The fact that this got a fucking article written about it shows how stupid people are. Wow, who the fuck knew you could see more things if you went to a higher vantage point!!! NO FUCKING WAY!!!
                lol this is the most Redditor comment I've ever seen in my life.
                    They don‚Äôt realize they‚Äôve been replying to the OP (me) this whole time, and they also apparently think this chimney is higher than the fucking volcano. üòÑ
                Well you‚Äôve been talking to the OP (me) this whole time, and I‚Äôm just still not getting it. Maybe if you try a few more messages in all caps, I‚Äôll understand how stupid I am. üòÑ
                    no duh, shithole. gee, I wonder who OP is. Maybe it's the guy with the big OP logo right next to his name, and with his head shoved so far up his ass he can hurl double the uninteresting, mundane and boring bullshit from his fucking mouth.
                        Damn I wish I could be there to see your reaction to this second article. https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/04/random_links_breath_of_the_wild_house_is_set_in_a_surprisingly_divine_location

oh my fucking god there's an article... this is fucking stupid. THIS IS NOT VERY INTERESTING OR COOL, YOU CAN SEE THE SAME GODDAMN FUCKING THING FROM ANY HIGH POINT ON THE FUCKING MAP ARE YOU DAFT?????

    Sorry yes I'm joking. I would never lie like that to a fellow botw fan. Would be great though if Link had like a mancave basement with like a fishing hole and milk bar.

What's cool is that you can *just barely* see a few of them.
I want to actually throw up after reading that
The tones/notes of the music really evoke an emotional response from me.
    Same. Whether it be the newer tracks or the remixes of music from older games that take me back, it just works for me. In [the trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw47_q9wbBE), it was the music that sucked me in and I decided I had to have that game.  And while the music as a whole was a bit more subtle/understated than in the trailer (outside a few areas/battles) the game sure as hell didn't disappoint.
    The Hateno song is nothing short of beautiful
    Me too. Especially when you hear the slow piano overworld music and it just has those sudden minor chord drops that are just saying "everything is not all right", lol it gives me chills all the time.
Wait, who‚Äôs Link?
    The legend of link.
        The Link of Zelda.

    I'll do you one better: *why* is Link?
Go and talk to the carpenters working on a house in Hateno. This will lead you to arguably the best side quest on the game, and you‚Äôll get a house too.
    Never knew this. Damn. Gonna try it out tomorrow.
        Hope you got wood ;)
            üò≥
Yes
    I thought he lived with Zelda?
        Pretty sure he did before because you buy this house during the game
This sub in a nutshell
Chimneys are not exclusively used to isolate smoke from a fireplace.
I never noticed either, but a lot of the time I have the minimap turned off
Ravioli is boiling
    r/ravioli
Only since I bought the shield that auto-parries tho
lol... If only I could get them all to fire at Bolson instead of Ganon.
It is? That was a while ago so I wouldn‚Äôt know.
    Yes, but only hinted at. Someone in Bolson's crew mentions it belonged to a soldier a hundred years ago who left for service and never returned. Zelda's diary mentions Link is from the country, and Hetano is pretty remote as far as Hyrule goes.
        Ahhhhh I see
            it was also said his hometown is hateno
                Pretty sure that was never said. Source?
                    https://www.reddit.com/r/Breath_of_the_Wild/comments/a11rx7/creating_a_champion_links_from_hateno_and_hes_the/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share I misread, it says he's probably from there. my bad.
                    The only source I know of that actually says he might be from Hetano is a game companion book called Breath of the Wild--Creating a Champion that says Link is rumored to be from Hetano.
                Who said this? Or where was it written?
                    https://www.reddit.com/r/Breath_of_the_Wild/comments/a11rx7/creating_a_champion_links_from_hateno_and_hes_the/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
        Not to mention the Kass side quest about the Hero's cache being at the beach outside of Hateno
            Wasn't that from the hero 10,000 years ago?
                Fair point! I hadn't even thought of that. A metal chest does to better underwater for 100 years opposed to 10 thousand but you may very well be right.
        Hateno is one of the largest settlements in Hyrule though...
            Well I mean before the calamity it would have been somewhat small compared to the rest of the larger communities that were destroyed
                I would suppose it would have been bigger, considering that they manned the wall?
            Yeah but originally there was a major town surrounding the castle plus a series of ranches, soldier garrisons, and trading outposts in the hyrule field area. The ranches and trading outposts would have been hubs for travelers and merchants, so for a person from the castle, any settlement outside of the hyrule castle region would be more countryside.
    I‚Äôm pretty sure there was some dialogue that said the house was suddenly abandoned after the war/event (however they call it, haven‚Äôt played the game in a while) and it‚Äôs implied that Link was the previous owner
        I think it‚Äôs a conversation you can have with Bolson and crew that the house was abandoned after a boy left to be a knight 100 years ago and they‚Äôre about to tear it down if it wasn‚Äôt for Link buying it back.
        Wait, I thought Hateno was used as a safe haven for people during the Calamity? Someone (idr who, I think Impa?) said it was one of the most untouched towns in Hyrule and was used to stay safe from the Calamity's monsters while it went on?
            Might‚Äôve been the most untouched area/region but i personally wouldn‚Äôt call it a safehaven, even then it‚Äôs not impossible for them to say that the house belongs to a soldier and they won‚Äôt sell it to newcomers for the small chance that the soldier would come back after a while. Given enough time people who had survived the calamity would‚Äôve already build new houses and that one stayed as a relic/reminder to the past
I don't remember anything like that in BotW, but I feel like Age of Calamity probably hints at it being Link's own house during that era too
Yes, very heavily hinted at.
No. There is one where Link visits a prostitute though.
    Zelda 2 for NES? I think I remember that being where you heal, but it's loosely implied to be a prostitute.
        Bingo. And you could say heavily implied. The callback in BOTW with the spa treatment was not introduced as "please let me help you. Come inside."
            Come inside you say?

Do they have the pill in Hyrule?
                Well, how do you think the Hero genes get passed on? Zelda is from a continuous bloodline of royals, Link is from a continuous bloodline of...

Though you have to bring water in order for the lady to let you (sic) in so I guess she used the old timey way.
    And got the *deluxe* spa treatment...
Not in game, but I'm sure it's pretty safe to say after the game in only SS. 

I mean, childhood friends, deep shared experiences, Link saved Zelda from Ghirahim and Demise, and lots of bonding time after on top of a preexisting close friendship? I'd be *highly* surprised if they relationship in that game didn't get much more personal after the end.
I have no idea. My best guess is they were trying to remain semi-accurate regarding the geography relative to the older games. Back in oot death mountain and Zora's domain were both to the east of Hyrule castle (assuming facing the castle head on is north). Although, gerudo valley was north west so it kinda falls apart
    Hm that's interesting thats cool if it's even a little bit how they placed things haha
Ok you convinced me to give it a shot lol. My favorite game growing up was ocarina of time, I‚Äôd just heard Botw was tedious
    Also, one of the few games where I feel the DLC is actually worth the money. It's almost cheap compared to what you actually get from it
        Also very true!
    Don't look anything up, just explore & try things. If you go in blind and get immersed in its world & the sense of adventure, it is truly a masterwork. It captures the same feel original LoZ did where you're plopped into a world and pushed off the edge into it - but with all the modern QoL fixins'
    I shot a Lynel with an ancient arrow
Wish i could play it on my pc
Agree. I'm at 485 hours on my main save, not much more to do... but flying from the Hateno Lab to Link's house at night is the best. With all blue flame lanterns lit.

The music of Kakariko is outstanding. Flying down into town from the Fairy Fountain at night... wearing full stealth gear... picking up the Sneaky River Snails from the small pond by the water wheel...

The art direction of the game lends it nearly infinite replayability; I'll probably still fire it up when my kids have kids.
    I just started again after 300 hours :D totally didnt know how i could keep old save ...
        Yeah you just need to create another profile on your switch (or wii u)
    > With all blue flame lanterns lit.

Having just started a new save I saw this and instantly thought oh god fuck those stupid quests
    Why the hell do all the sneaky animals glow in the dark???
        Bioluminescence. Lots of animals have it irl. Or perhaps they absorb chemicals from Luminous Stones.

Man there's so much cool stuff that glows in the game.

Night time is the right time.
            Yeah no I know why they glow but why do the sneaky animals make themselves not sneaky?
    Agreed - I've long since finished the story and sidequests, but I love booting up BotW just to ride around on my horse. It's just a game like no other, in my humble experience.

There's a 10 hour video for each city/area
    Thanks mate. Think I'll be sleeping very soundly tonight.
Probably very much on purpose.
Lurelin, too! The music is so serene
Yep. I got it. Took a few days to adjust as I‚Äôm coming off competitive FPS‚Ä¶aaand I love it. It‚Äôs awesome <3
    It‚Äôs taken over my life and ruined all other games for me lmao!
        The ability to just play for 5 minutes or 5 hours is so nice. I forgot you can play video games without being stressed out, and now I‚Äôm staring at digital sunsets and smiling. Hate to make such an easy pun, but it‚Äôs often breathtaking.
            And if you need a bit of stress there‚Äôs always the Trial of the Sword üëçüèº
I'm surprised durability is such a big deal to people. I have way more weapons then I actually need; I can't break them fast enough.
> the durability thing

Weapons are so easy to find though. I never really got this argument because keeping a constant stock is insanely easy. 

> physics puzzles

A couple of the motion control ones are a bit frustrating, yeah. Most have workarounds thankfully.
There‚Äôs so much in this game. Thank you.
Thats one too many syllables, bub.
    Oust haiku bot from the haiku club
Any way on how to make a full gameplay?
    No sorry, you‚Äôd need a capture card for that.
Ah
Ah! It's still cool. But I guess I won't be seeing them for a while, then...
    I shot a Lynel with an ancient arrow
Had no idea there was even a house you could buy. I want to beat this game so bad but the durability thing (and a few of those physics puzzles) just kills this game for me. Beaten every other zelda game. God I hope they adjust it remove it in the next one or I'm gonna be crushed.
    Don't worry about the weapons, they come aplenty and it gets easier and easier. Don't even let it stress you, and the game is so worth it
If it's so permenant then why doesn't Nintendo just add that step to the assembly line?
    It's not permanent. That part of the statement is bullshit.
        I've had my og switch controllers since launch, drift happened after a year and they've been fine since. Never heard of anyone using this trick having to do it again.
            And what is the cause of this drift? Dust right?
Nope
    Yep. Don't know what to tell ya bud, but it works. Og switch controllers bought on day one work like new
        Yes and many more people tried this out and it doesn't work. Some drifts are more severe than others and can't be easily repaired like that
I live in Egypt and Nintendo isn't really available here...
Even something as simple as the Nintendo eshop isn't available...
Makes sense, those must be pretty big creatures if the games map is large!
It's not just boring, it's fucking stupid. I think you'd be able to see the whole solar system from a fucking telescope on pluto if you went there but nobody's making articles about that because it's FUCKING OBVIOUS. NO SHIT YOU CAN SEE ALL OF HYRULE FROM ONE OF THE HIGHEST POINTS ON THE CORNER OF THE GODDAMN MAP.
    It must be so maddening to know that so many other people found this interesting.
        Because everyone is stupid. Especially OP themself. This is uninteresting and completely fucking obvious. The fact that this got a fucking article written about it shows how stupid people are. Wow, who the fuck knew you could see more things if you went to a higher vantage point!!! NO FUCKING WAY!!!
            lol this is the most Redditor comment I've ever seen in my life.
                They don‚Äôt realize they‚Äôve been replying to the OP (me) this whole time, and they also apparently think this chimney is higher than the fucking volcano. üòÑ
            Well you‚Äôve been talking to the OP (me) this whole time, and I‚Äôm just still not getting it. Maybe if you try a few more messages in all caps, I‚Äôll understand how stupid I am. üòÑ
                no duh, shithole. gee, I wonder who OP is. Maybe it's the guy with the big OP logo right next to his name, and with his head shoved so far up his ass he can hurl double the uninteresting, mundane and boring bullshit from his fucking mouth.
                    Damn I wish I could be there to see your reaction to this second article. https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/04/random_links_breath_of_the_wild_house_is_set_in_a_surprisingly_divine_location

That is the detail...
    And I'm saying that's neat
Same. Whether it be the newer tracks or the remixes of music from older games that take me back, it just works for me. In [the trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw47_q9wbBE), it was the music that sucked me in and I decided I had to have that game.  And while the music as a whole was a bit more subtle/understated than in the trailer (outside a few areas/battles) the game sure as hell didn't disappoint.
The Hateno song is nothing short of beautiful
Me too. Especially when you hear the slow piano overworld music and it just has those sudden minor chord drops that are just saying "everything is not all right", lol it gives me chills all the time.
The legend of link.
    The Link of Zelda.
The person who owns the house Zelda is climbing on in this video.
    Wait, what's a house?!
        What, what‚Äôs ‚Äúa?‚Äù
            Wait, what's wait!?
                Why is Gamora, I mean Zelda?
                    I'll do you one better, why is why?
                        ?
                        Because I said so
                Wait?
                    ?!
The princess, that Zelda tries to save in this game.
    Wait, there's a... a *game*??
        There is no Game
            Take off your clothes
        Wait, there‚Äôs a?

It's Neil, actually.
Hyah!
He‚Äôs Zelda
I'll do you one better: *why* is Link?
Never knew this. Damn. Gonna try it out tomorrow.
    Hope you got wood ;)
        üò≥
I thought he lived with Zelda?
    Pretty sure he did before because you buy this house during the game
r/ravioli
Yes, but only hinted at. Someone in Bolson's crew mentions it belonged to a soldier a hundred years ago who left for service and never returned. Zelda's diary mentions Link is from the country, and Hetano is pretty remote as far as Hyrule goes.
    Ahhhhh I see
        it was also said his hometown is hateno
            Pretty sure that was never said. Source?
                https://www.reddit.com/r/Breath_of_the_Wild/comments/a11rx7/creating_a_champion_links_from_hateno_and_hes_the/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share I misread, it says he's probably from there. my bad.
                The only source I know of that actually says he might be from Hetano is a game companion book called Breath of the Wild--Creating a Champion that says Link is rumored to be from Hetano.
            Who said this? Or where was it written?
                https://www.reddit.com/r/Breath_of_the_Wild/comments/a11rx7/creating_a_champion_links_from_hateno_and_hes_the/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
    Not to mention the Kass side quest about the Hero's cache being at the beach outside of Hateno
        Wasn't that from the hero 10,000 years ago?
            Fair point! I hadn't even thought of that. A metal chest does to better underwater for 100 years opposed to 10 thousand but you may very well be right.
    Hateno is one of the largest settlements in Hyrule though...
        Well I mean before the calamity it would have been somewhat small compared to the rest of the larger communities that were destroyed
            I would suppose it would have been bigger, considering that they manned the wall?
        Yeah but originally there was a major town surrounding the castle plus a series of ranches, soldier garrisons, and trading outposts in the hyrule field area. The ranches and trading outposts would have been hubs for travelers and merchants, so for a person from the castle, any settlement outside of the hyrule castle region would be more countryside.
I‚Äôm pretty sure there was some dialogue that said the house was suddenly abandoned after the war/event (however they call it, haven‚Äôt played the game in a while) and it‚Äôs implied that Link was the previous owner
    I think it‚Äôs a conversation you can have with Bolson and crew that the house was abandoned after a boy left to be a knight 100 years ago and they‚Äôre about to tear it down if it wasn‚Äôt for Link buying it back.
    Wait, I thought Hateno was used as a safe haven for people during the Calamity? Someone (idr who, I think Impa?) said it was one of the most untouched towns in Hyrule and was used to stay safe from the Calamity's monsters while it went on?
        Might‚Äôve been the most untouched area/region but i personally wouldn‚Äôt call it a safehaven, even then it‚Äôs not impossible for them to say that the house belongs to a soldier and they won‚Äôt sell it to newcomers for the small chance that the soldier would come back after a while. Given enough time people who had survived the calamity would‚Äôve already build new houses and that one stayed as a relic/reminder to the past
Zelda 2 for NES? I think I remember that being where you heal, but it's loosely implied to be a prostitute.
    Bingo. And you could say heavily implied. The callback in BOTW with the spa treatment was not introduced as "please let me help you. Come inside."
        Come inside you say?

Do they have the pill in Hyrule?
            Well, how do you think the Hero genes get passed on? Zelda is from a continuous bloodline of royals, Link is from a continuous bloodline of...

Though you have to bring water in order for the lady to let you (sic) in so I guess she used the old timey way.
And got the *deluxe* spa treatment...
Hm that's interesting thats cool if it's even a little bit how they placed things haha
Also, one of the few games where I feel the DLC is actually worth the money. It's almost cheap compared to what you actually get from it
    Also very true!
Don't look anything up, just explore & try things. If you go in blind and get immersed in its world & the sense of adventure, it is truly a masterwork. It captures the same feel original LoZ did where you're plopped into a world and pushed off the edge into it - but with all the modern QoL fixins'
I shot a Lynel with an ancient arrow
I just started again after 300 hours :D totally didnt know how i could keep old save ...
    Yeah you just need to create another profile on your switch (or wii u)

Having just started a new save I saw this and instantly thought oh god fuck those stupid quests
Why the hell do all the sneaky animals glow in the dark???
    Bioluminescence. Lots of animals have it irl. Or perhaps they absorb chemicals from Luminous Stones.

Man there's so much cool stuff that glows in the game.

Night time is the right time.
        Yeah no I know why they glow but why do the sneaky animals make themselves not sneaky?
Agreed - I've long since finished the story and sidequests, but I love booting up BotW just to ride around on my horse. It's just a game like no other, in my humble experience.
Thanks mate. Think I'll be sleeping very soundly tonight.
It‚Äôs taken over my life and ruined all other games for me lmao!
    The ability to just play for 5 minutes or 5 hours is so nice. I forgot you can play video games without being stressed out, and now I‚Äôm staring at digital sunsets and smiling. Hate to make such an easy pun, but it‚Äôs often breathtaking.
        And if you need a bit of stress there‚Äôs always the Trial of the Sword üëçüèº
Oust haiku bot from the haiku club
No sorry, you‚Äôd need a capture card for that.
I shot a Lynel with an ancient arrow
Don't worry about the weapons, they come aplenty and it gets easier and easier. Don't even let it stress you, and the game is so worth it
It's not permanent. That part of the statement is bullshit.
    I've had my og switch controllers since launch, drift happened after a year and they've been fine since. Never heard of anyone using this trick having to do it again.
        And what is the cause of this drift? Dust right?
Yep. Don't know what to tell ya bud, but it works. Og switch controllers bought on day one work like new
    Yes and many more people tried this out and it doesn't work. Some drifts are more severe than others and can't be easily repaired like that
It must be so maddening to know that so many other people found this interesting.
    Because everyone is stupid. Especially OP themself. This is uninteresting and completely fucking obvious. The fact that this got a fucking article written about it shows how stupid people are. Wow, who the fuck knew you could see more things if you went to a higher vantage point!!! NO FUCKING WAY!!!
        lol this is the most Redditor comment I've ever seen in my life.
            They don‚Äôt realize they‚Äôve been replying to the OP (me) this whole time, and they also apparently think this chimney is higher than the fucking volcano. üòÑ
        Well you‚Äôve been talking to the OP (me) this whole time, and I‚Äôm just still not getting it. Maybe if you try a few more messages in all caps, I‚Äôll understand how stupid I am. üòÑ
            no duh, shithole. gee, I wonder who OP is. Maybe it's the guy with the big OP logo right next to his name, and with his head shoved so far up his ass he can hurl double the uninteresting, mundane and boring bullshit from his fucking mouth.
                Damn I wish I could be there to see your reaction to this second article. https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/04/random_links_breath_of_the_wild_house_is_set_in_a_surprisingly_divine_location

Given enough time people who had survived the calamity would‚Äôve already build new houses and that one stayed as a relic/reminder to the past
Come inside you say?

Do they have the pill in Hyrule?
    Well, how do you think the Hero genes get passed on? Zelda is from a continuous bloodline of royals, Link is from a continuous bloodline of...

Though you have to bring water in order for the lady to let you (sic) in so I guess she used the old timey way.
Yeah no I know why they glow but why do the sneaky animals make themselves not sneaky?
And if you need a bit of stress there‚Äôs always the Trial of the Sword üëçüèº
And what is the cause of this drift? Dust right?
lol this is the most Redditor comment I've ever seen in my life.
    They don‚Äôt realize they‚Äôve been replying to the OP (me) this whole time, and they also apparently think this chimney is higher than the fucking volcano. üòÑ
Well you‚Äôve been talking to the OP (me) this whole time, and I‚Äôm just still not getting it. Maybe if you try a few more messages in all caps, I‚Äôll understand how stupid I am. üòÑ
    no duh, shithole. gee, I wonder who OP is. Maybe it's the guy with the big OP logo right next to his name, and with his head shoved so far up his ass he can hurl double the uninteresting, mundane and boring bullshit from his fucking mouth.
        Damn I wish I could be there to see your reaction to this second article. https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/04/random_links_breath_of_the_wild_house_is_set_in_a_surprisingly_divine_location
            Is this supposed to prove something?
Plot twist: Ganondorf is under Link‚Äôs house
    Ganondorf is Link‚Äòs house
        Obligatory, "Ganondorf was the friends we made along the way."
            I need to look for new friends then preferably ones not trying to kill me.
        Ganondorf is Hateno...

        You discover new things in this game all the time. At this point there might as well be a basement I did not know about.
            we don‚Äôt talk about the kids I forgot about 100 years ago in there
Yeah I think your right
    Don‚Äôt bother with her (yes, the user‚Äôs a girl). She‚Äôs kind of a troll. I tried reading about the stuff that she says. It just gave me a headache. It‚Äôs a lot of nonsense but at the same time, not really nonsense. I gave up in the end.
        What‚Äôs she say?
Makes me wish I had read his comment
Haha
Oh yeah , I never get how these people have so much karma
Good bot
Wait, what's wait!?

Pretty sure that was never said. Source?
    https://www.reddit.com/r/Breath_of_the_Wild/comments/a11rx7/creating_a_champion_links_from_hateno_and_hes_the/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share I misread, it says he's probably from there. my bad.
    The only source I know of that actually says he might be from Hetano is a game companion book called Breath of the Wild--Creating a Champion that says Link is rumored to be from Hetano.
Who said this? Or where was it written?

Fair point! I hadn't even thought of that. A metal chest does to better underwater for 100 years opposed to 10 thousand but you may very well be right.
I would suppose it would have been bigger, considering that they manned the wall?
