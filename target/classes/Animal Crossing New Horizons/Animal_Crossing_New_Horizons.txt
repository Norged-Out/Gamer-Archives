'''''Animal Crossing: New Horizons'''''{{efn|Known in Japan as {{Nihongo||あつまれ どうぶつの森|'''''Atsumare Dōbutsu no Mori'''''|{{lit}} ''Get Together: Animal Forest''|lead=yes}}}} is a [[social simulation game]] developed and published by [[Nintendo]] in 2020 for the [[Nintendo Switch]]; it is the fifth main entry in the [[Animal Crossing|''Animal Crossing'' series]]. In ''New Horizons'', the player controls a character who moves to a deserted island after purchasing a getaway package from [[Tom Nook]], accomplishes assigned tasks, and develops the island as they choose. They can gather and craft items, customize the island, and develop it into a community of [[anthropomorphic]] animals.
Development of ''New Horizons'' began in 2012, following the release of ''[[Animal Crossing: New Leaf]]''. The game director, [[Aya Kyogoku]], retained content from previous games to keep fans happy and also ensured that the game was simple enough to appeal to newcomers. With art and graphics, the developers used the concept of "trigger of play" and the "imagination gap", where the former kept the gameplay simplistic and easy to pick up while the latter kept the art style simple for the player to imagine the rest. The game was announced at [[E3 2019]] via a [[Nintendo Direct]] and after an extended development period, was released worldwide on March 20, 2020.
''New Horizons'' received acclaim from critics, who praised its gameplay and customization options and called it the best game in the ''Animal Crossing'' series. The game was nominated for over a dozen awards and was a major commercial success, selling over {{nowrap|44 million}} copies worldwide and breaking the console game record for most digital units sold in a single month. It is the best-selling game in the ''Animal Crossing'' series, the second [[best-selling game on the Nintendo Switch]], the best-selling game of all time in Japan, and the 14th [[List of best-selling video games|best-selling video game in history]]. Its commercial success has been attributed in part to its release amid global [[COVID-19 lockdowns|stay-at-home orders]] during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. The game has been used as a substitute for social interactions such as weddings and graduation ceremonies, as well as political campaigning and virtual protests. The game also inspired fan creations, such as [[Nookazon|a trading website]], [[Animal Talking with Gary Whitta|a talk show]], comics, and merchandise. It received major updates adding new content until November 2021.
==Gameplay==
As in previous ''Animal Crossing'' games, ''New Horizons'' is a [[life simulation game]] played in [[Real time (media)|real time]]. Weather also adjusts to the seasons of the [[Northern Hemisphere|Northern]] or [[Southern Hemisphere]], depending on the player's real-world location, a first for the ''Animal Crossing'' series. The game follows a villager customized by the player, who, after purchasing a getaway package from [[Tom Nook]], moves into a deserted island. After Tom Nook gives the player essentials, such as a tent, the game proceeds in a [[Nonlinear gameplay|non-linear]] fashion, allowing for the player to play the game as they choose with only a small amount of limitations which lessen as the player progresses.
[[File:Animal Crossing New Horizons Gameplay.jpg|thumb|right|Two players on one island via multiplayer. The player to the right is harvesting wood from a tree using an axe.]]
The player is given open access to natural resources such as fruit and wood, which can be collected and crafted into a variety of items and furniture known as [[D.I.Y.]] crafting. Alongside this, they can catch bugs and fish, plant and grow trees and flowers, extract natural resources such as rocks, and swim in the ocean. The island gives open space for placing items and decorating as the player chooses. Certain content available, such as organisms, are season-dependant and only appear for a limited time of the year. Doing simple tasks rewards the player with "Nook Miles", which in return can purchase premium rewards in Resident Services. The other currency "Bells", a staple in the ''Animal Crossing'' franchise, can be used to purchase other goods and services. Another feature offered early on is the "Dodo Airlines", an airport; through Dodo Airlines, and tickets purchased through Nook Miles, the player can visit other vacant islands to harvest resources and meet other villagers. The player can invite other villagers they meet to their island if they choose.
The player starts with two other random [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] villagers that also purchase the getaway package. These villagers will live alongside the player and can be interacted with, building relationships. eventually expanding to sell more items per day. That store is named ''Nook's Cranny''. However, more options for island customization are given to the player for further community growth, such as the ability to construct and destroy cliffs, bodies of water and paths, colloquially referred to as [[terraforming]].
The game supports one island per Switch system. ''Animal Crossing: New Horizons'' supports both local and online [[Cooperative video game|co-op gameplay]], with up to four players locally and eight players online able to occupy an island at any given time, an option available through the Dodo Airlines. Additional free content was added every few months via updates from Nintendo until the final version 2.0 update on November 3, 2021.
=== Updates ===
Since the game depends on seasonal changes, ''New Horizons'' received frequent updates, adding new seasonal items, events, and sometimes new gameplay features. Most updates are loosely based around national holidays, with the first update being themed around "Bunny Day" in April 2020 and based on [[Easter]]. Other seasonal updates followed, being "Nature Day" ([[Earth Day]]), [[May Day]], [[Halloween]], "Turkey Day" ([[Thanksgiving]]), and "Toy Day" ([[Christmas]]). Other popular seasonal events, such as summer, also came with new items. Each respective update also featured popular characters from past ''Animal Crossing'' games. With each update, the island changed in look, and the player's island is often decorated for the occasion. Alongside seasonal changes, Nintendo has also released themed items from other popular media, such as [[Mario (franchise)|''Mario'']] outfits and decor in celebration of the franchise's [[Super Mario Bros. 35th Anniversary|35th anniversary]].
In an October 2021 ''New Horizons''-focused [[Nintendo Direct]], Nintendo announced the version 2.0 update would be released the following month and would be the final major free content update for the game. The update added returning characters Kapp'n and Brewster, both bringing new activities and locations to the game, as well as the ability to fund permanent locations for the game's random visiting vendors. Alongside other quality-of-life improvements, it also included new purchasable items, such as furniture and music, new villagers, and the ability to cook food via farmed crops. The update released on November 3, 2021.
==== ''Happy Home Paradise'' ====
Announced alongside the final major update for ''New Horizons'' was paid [[downloadable content]], entitled '''''Happy Home Paradise'''''. Similar to the 2015 spinoff ''[[Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer]]'', the expansion allows players to visit a distant island and design vacation homes for villagers, and adds new customization options that can also be used on players' personal islands once learned. The ''Happy Home Paradise'' add-on was released on November 5, 2021.

Development of a new main series ''Animal Crossing'' game for the [[Nintendo Switch]] was confirmed in a [[Nintendo Direct]] on September 13, 2018, with an unspecified 2019 release date. she stated how concepts for the game were forming long before ideas for the Nintendo Switch had even existed. [[Hisashi Nogami]] and [[Katsuya Eguchi]] reprised their roles as the game's producers.
Nintendo released the game's title and first trailer at its [[E3 2019]] Nintendo Direct on June 11, 2019. The game was delayed until March 20, 2020, with [[Yoshiaki Koizumi]] stating that in order "to ensure [that] the game [was] the best it [could] be, [Nintendo had to] ask that [players] wait a little longer than [Nintendo itself] thought." Nintendo of America president [[Doug Bowser]] cited a desire to avoid [[Crunch (video games)|crunch]] and maintain a healthy [[work–life balance]] for Nintendo employees as the primary reason for the delay. Nintendo's stock market value posted a 3.5% loss in reaction to the delay, amounting to a total loss in value of more than US$1 billion.
Kyogoku stated that the success of the ''Animal Crossing'' series was due to the fact that the developers make each game different enough from the last, to bring appeal to newcomers yet keep the core concept for returning players. Kyogoku and Nogami stated that they selected a deserted island as the game's setting to differentiate it from previous ''Animal Crossing'' games, which are set in established villages, and to allow greater freedom to customize the game's world. Other concepts, such as the internet and multiplayer, were able to be implemented, unlike previous games due to advancing hardware. Kyogoku made sure to keep balance of introducing new and fresh ideas while retaining core elements to satisfy long-term fans of the series.
The developers were very disappointed when the game's release cycle overlapped with the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. Due to [[Travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic|quarantine]] during the pandemic, Kyogoku hoped that the game would be an "escape" for fans at the time. They emphasized a global release to allow for international connections between the players.
=== Game mechanics and concepts ===
The developers sought to make the game both welcoming to new players and to retain core concepts from the previous games to keep older fans of the series happy. A crafting system was implemented to allow the player to keep the player from running out of things to do after the in-game stores close. Kyogoku mentioned how the D.I.Y. crafting system would keep players in theme with the game by interacting and using the natural environment to their advantage. She took note of players who began playing ''Animal Crossing'' games via mobile apps, such as ''[[Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp]]'', by implementing the Nook Miles feature which would show the player what kinds of activities and concepts they can achieve by rewarding them to do so. The Nook Miles system also rewards the player for doing common tasks and collecting materials that would sell for cheap to keep the player from only tediously searching out expensive materials. Furniture and clothing accessibility and customization were emphasized for multiplayer so players could show pride in their islands.
Additionally, the developers noticed that players would repeatedly restart their save file in previous titles, in hopes of getting their desired island shape. Because of this, landscaping was implemented to allow for easy shaping of the island. Another issue they noticed was "time-traveling"; due to the game running in real-time, players would change the clock on the console to put themselves further into the future, so they don't have to wait in real-time. To help avoid this, they made sure landscaping and crafting did not have any wait-time restrictions. Although the developers intended no time-traveling to be the ideal way of playing, they did not shun the concept entirely.
=== Art and graphics ===
[[File:Retro Electric Fan Concept Art.jpeg|thumb|right|Concept artwork for the "Retro Electric Fan"; art designer Hiromi Sugimoto explained how the "imagination gap" leaves furniture designs broad so the player can envision it as a real-life counterpart.]]
The game's art director, Koji Takahashi, followed the philosophy of "trigger of play" to make sure there was something within the player's field of vision or grasp that they would want to explore. With this, the island was designed from a 45-degree angle similar to that of a cylinder, or a "curved" perspective, where the player could view other content occurring in the background that would "trigger" them to investigate further or interact. By making an everyday concept simple and easy to grasp, it would cause the player to explore it further and be able to easily pick up the new material. Takahashi believed that if the game's art was complicated and realistic, the player would possibly receive too much information and make progression difficult. The simple design allowed for a multiple of one object to be stacked close to each other, such as flowers, or allow for simplistic objects to compliment others.
By leaving empty space and with a simplistic design, with simple graphics and little nature complexity, Takahashi explains how it would have the player attempt to fill in that gap with their own perspectives and ideas, called the "imagination gap", and further motivation to create their own designs and space with the features available. In the game, the grass is designed to look like that of a checkerboard. Although this concept was only used in prior titles due to a lack of hardware complexity, it was retained because it could be used as a form of expression for the player and allow them to conceptualize ideas with the "imagination gap".
Art designer Hiromi Sugimoto made sure furniture would lead to motivation and hard work, and thus make the player want to connect with others to show off their achievements. She made sure the furniture could be customized by the player to ensure the difference between islands that would motivate visiting others and seeing unique ideas. Each furniture model was designed to have a "likeness" to it which would show exactly what to expect and what the player envisions; the pieces of furniture and items implemented various portions on how players view an object to look like and combine the commons ideas into one model. From there, using the "imagination gap", the player could fill in the smaller nitpicky info they would expect and further imagine how they could use the item.
===Release===
The March 20, 2020, release date for ''New Horizons'' coincided with that of [[id Software]]'s ''[[Doom Eternal]]''. Due to the demand expected for both games, and in light of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], [[GameStop]] decided to begin selling ''Doom Eternal'' one day earlier, on the 19th, to minimize crowding. The stark contrast in tone between both games, combined with them being released on the same day, prompted fans of both series to celebrate the coincidence by creating light-hearted crossover art featuring ''[[Doom (franchise)|Doom]]''{{'}}s [[Doomguy]] and Isabelle as "best friends". When ''New Horizons'' released on March 20, 2020, video game retailer [[EB Games]] attracted criticism for allowing fans who pre-ordered the game along with ''Doom Eternal'' to line up at its flagship Canadian location on [[Yonge Street]], [[Toronto]] amid a [[COVID-19 pandemic in Canada|COVID-19 pandemic in the country]], when all levels of government urged the public to close non-essential businesses and maintain [[social distancing]].
Touching on ''New Horizons'' in a December 2020 interview with ''Polygon'', Nintendo of America President [[Doug Bowser]] stated the game sold "well beyond expectations" and applauded the developers for their efforts. He noted the game would continue to see updates all throughout 2021.

''Animal Crossing: New Horizons'' received "universal acclaim" according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]], becoming the highest-rated game in the series on the website. However, the game has been subject to [[review bomb]]ing due to its handling of Switch profiles and multiplayer. The game was cited to be the best in the series, and was given a perfect score by ''[[Nintendo Life]]'' and ''[[Pocket Gamer]]''.
Most enjoyed the Nook Miles system, stating that it gave the player something to do and a goal to reach. ''[[Eurogamer]]'' Deputy Editor Martin Robinson stated that the game has some very impressive improvements which allowed for a much clearer and more defined structure overall that gave the game play a better feel and cohesion than ever before.
Critics from ''[[GameSpot]]'' and ''[[Game Informer]]'' praised the creative freedom and control offered by the game, such as being allowed to choose where buildings and bridges are placed. In particular, the Island Designer App was lauded with its ability to create natural structures, although there were minor complaints about how the player could not expand the island and could only reshape it. ''[[GamesRadar+]]'' appreciated the retaining of old characters and concepts with the addition of new gameplay mechanics.
[[Slant Magazine]]'s Steven Scaife was more critical of the game, arguing that "By consolidating so much power in the hands of an individual player, ''New Horizons'' threatens to upend the ''Animal Crossing'' vision of community living."
Many had complaints about time restrictions in the early phases of the game. Since the game runs in real-time, most of the resources available replenish the next day, and reviewers were left with little to do in the beginning. ''[[IGN]]''{{'}}s Samuel Claiborn refused to time travel in prior titles, but ultimately was tempted into putting the system's clock ahead 15 days in when more tools were unlocked and to begin what he believed was when the game had faster pacing. ''[[4Players]]'' enjoyed the lack of time-related pressure and the option to time travel if preferred.
Outside of gameplay itself, ''New Horizons'' received acclaim for the timing of the release, coming out just as [[COVID-19 lockdowns|stay-at-home orders]] were being fortified. Reviewer Louryne Strampe of ''[[Wired (magazine)|WIRED]]'' found that the game was exactly what she needed for her mental health and added that she and her colleagues find solace when visiting each other's respective islands. Due to online multiplayer options, it also gave critics the opportunity to play with friends during quarantine. The release of ''New Horizons'', has also sparked in popularity of the term [[cozy game]] which meant that the term was also adopted to various [[farm sim]]s such as ''[[Stardew Valley]]''.
The downloadable content expansion, ''Happy Home Paradise'', was well received. Lisa Segarra of ''Kotaku'' found the prompts for designing villager homes to be "exhilarating" and that it "sparked inspiration". She found that the update brought "so much new life into the game". Kate Gray of ''Nintendo Life'' described the new content in the expansion and the free update as being comparable to "a big lick of paint over the whole game". The depth and quantity of new content were praised, and minor improvements were deemed to "really make it worth sticking around", though the finality of the update was criticized.
=== Retrospective ===
Due to the seasonal and real-time connection in ''New Horizons'', the game saw multiple second opinions by critics and fans as new content was released, usually of positive to mixed reception. According to ''[[Vice Media]]'' and ''[[VentureBeat]]'' about 6 weeks after the release date, players who played the game for large amounts of time shortly after its release tended to suffer from [[Occupational burnout|burnout]] and play significantly less by the time the game had been released for six weeks. ''Vice Media'' noted how the game wasn't designed for people to be playing all the time and was rather intended for distraction, but "the pandemic isn't giving people much of a choice"; they reflected on the nature of the ''Animal Crossing'' series and how the game is better enjoyed at a slower pace of action. ''Venturebeat''{{'}}s Jeff Grubb was able to recognize smaller hindrances and slow-paced gameplay that became increasingly frustrating the more he had to use them. Despite this, both reviewers continued to play and looked on the game positively by April 2020.
A year later, past reviews were revisited by Andrew Webster and Brendan Lowry, writing for ''[[The Verge]]'' and ''[[iMore]]'' respectively, and both expressed similar thoughts of what the game had become; they both agreed the lack of island progression not continuing beyond a few months made returning difficult to enjoy, with ''iMore'' expressing concerns for the lack of upgrades to components such as buildings and shops,
===Sales===

It was the year's best-selling game in Japan, second best-selling game in the United Kingdom, and third best-selling game in the United States. The game grossed {{US$|654 million|long=no}} in global digital sales by the end of 2020, making it the year's seventh highest-grossing digital premium game worldwide. In January 2021, The NPD Group revealed the best-selling games of 2020 in the United States. ''New Horizons'' was ranked third behind ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops: Cold War]]'' and ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019 video game)|Call of Duty: Modern Warfare]]''. The publication revealed that ''New Horizons'' was the best-selling Nintendo game in terms of physical copies in the US since 2010's ''[[Wii Fit Plus]]''.

Reviewers and news organizations highlighted the game's sense of escapism, in contrast to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], as attributing to its success. An ''[[NBC News]]'' op-ed declared, "[''New Horizons''] is the coronavirus distraction we needed" at a time of widespread [[social distancing]] and [[Stay-at-home order|stay-at-home]] orders. Imad Khan of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the game a "phenomenon", and stated that "with the world in the grip of a pandemic, the wildly popular game is a conveniently timed piece of whimsy, particularly for millennials." Many people have utilized the game in different ways for business and/or socialization. Funerals, weddings, and graduations were held in the game, The [[Monterey Bay Aquarium]], California, during the COVID-19 pandemic, has regularly held live streams of animal feedings. Twitter revealed, in early January 2021, that ''Animal Crossing: New Horizons'' was the most [[Twitter|tweeted]]-about game in 2020.
The [[Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign]] released official digital [[Lawn sign|yard signs]] for use in the game that players could use to decorate their islands. The game was also used by democracy activists in [[Hong Kong]], including [[Joshua Wong]], as a platform to [[2019–20 Hong Kong protests|protest]] virtually. In reaction, the game was removed from online stores in China such as [[Taobao]] where it had been available on the [[grey market]]. Nintendo announced on November 19, 2020, a new set of guidelines for using the game, including the ban on using it for political activities.
In March 2021, the [[National Videogame Museum (United Kingdom)|National Videogame Museum]] kept a record of the game and its impact during the COVID-19 pandemic, titled the "''Animal Crossing'' Diaries". The records contain visuals, audio, interviews from players throughout 2020, who kept track of their progress and reflected on their experience and how it affected them. According to Lex Roberts, the curator, the goal was to encapture what made the game so popular, alongside its cultural impact, to players who enjoyed the game after COVID-19 restrictions settled. They were requested by the [[Esmée Fairbairn Foundation]] to "collect the history as it's happening", and they were funded by the charity to do so. The website containing the records opened in September 2021, and covered the 18 months after the game's release.
Two Japanese aquariums have hosted a special ''Animal Crossing: New Horizons'' themed event in collaboration with Nintendo. Hakkeijima Sea Paradise, located in [[Yokohama]], held this event during the months of July and August 2021. Umigatari [[Jōetsu, Niigata|Joetsu]] Aquarium, in Niigata Prefecture, held the second event for three months in the summer of 2023.
