[[This raises some questions]]





wait 
IT‚ÄôS MAY
    There's a distinct possibility
    Shit I never caught the blue marlin
        I managed to catch exactly one all month
             You‚Äôre lucky. I swear o almost caught one but it let go as soon as it grabbed onto the hook i didn‚Äôt even have time to press A
                Wait you‚Äôre all catching rare fish all I got is a sea bass and a lot of crawfish
                    Wait you caught crawfish and all I got was a lot of tires and cans
                        Gotta catch the fish before you can it baby just one step ahead
                            lol nice
                            lol nice
                    Sure am. Just going through lots of broken fishing poles and fish bait and inventories full of sea bass
                I found both the blue marlin and tuna so hard to catch, the same thing happened to me everytime I got anything I thought was either one. They're so fast! 

When I finally caught a tuna, I sat there chanting 'Tuna! Tuna! Tuna!'
                    I finally caught my first tuna last night after realizing they would be gone for months and frantically using bait after bait that when I did get it I got really excited and scared the poor dogs. :/  haha
            i caught a bunch. i fish a lot though
                Same, caught like 10 marlin and 7 tuna. The key was mystery islands I caught all on mystery islands
                    I only caught around 2 each on the mystery islands, probably because i mostly just catch bugs on them. my island has good fishing i think though. probably caught around 10 c-canths last month at least. Was always one short of a collectible when CJ pulled around though :/ 
However, on one island I caught five golden trout which was awesome

finally just today caught a freaking ranchu goldfish. Used like 50 bait trying to get one, and just randomly got one trying to get a frog this morning
                        I tried for 2 nights trying to catch a dang freshwater golby, wasted tons of bait & hours of my life. I visit my fiance's island & see him catch one for CJ. The he goes "try that one".

It was a dang freaking golby! I was so mad. But happy to be done with it lol
                            That‚Äôs just bad rng, there‚Äôre somewhat common
                                He gets them all the time, I still haven't got one on my own island. But I got 2 oarfish so far lmao
                    I thought you could only catch Marlins off the dock though?
                        The area where the plane lands is considered the pier on mystery islands.
                            Ohh okay gotcha!
        I farmed Manila clams for 3 days and built up a stockpile of bait just so I could farm for hours. Managed to get one on my 13th cast. Let me tell you. I was a little peeved at doing all that farming lol.
        blue marlin will be back in july
        Me tooo !! *Cries* I think imma just tt back lol
            Just make sure there's no turnips on your island!
        I got like 7 OOF
        Can you go back in time and get it then?
            I can but that‚Äôs just being extra. It‚Äôll come back in july
    Oh fuck
        my home is going to be filled with frogs and frog collectibles
    I said the same thing at 1 AM finding a new bug haha
        nicee what bug was it
            Rosalia batesi beetle. Mistook it for a citrus long-horned at first but it looked odd so I caught it xD

Edit: Aaaaand I just caught a violin beetle
    I found a ceolacanth but I accidentally released it
        That‚Äôs such a bad feeling. Has happened to me so many times with turantulas

i remember finally catching the neon tetra and accidentally selling it. terrible
This game is too meta.
    walker deadass tells me that he feels like he‚Äôs living inside of a game and i am frightened
        Cole told me some woman from a ‚Äúuser-research firm‚Äù approached him and said to him that his orange shirt raised audience interest by 12 percent
            Okay, now it's obvious some of our villagers are schizophrenics.
Guys it's fucking MAY oml I'm so excited to catch new stuff!!
Presumably the villagers are half human.

Let's not think too far into that one.
    Nah, if you check the evolution tree in the museum, the villagers all evolved separately from their respective genuses.
        Wow, what? In what section can that be found?
            Dino
            Walk in the museum fossil area. If you follow the patterns on the floor you they trace out an evolutionary tree. In the last room there is a moose like creature, a saber tooth cat, an early human, etc. Behind them and connected to them in the tree are frames that depict the villager types.

    That is amazing! Lol
I kept catching tadpoles and releasing them in my island ponds, in hope
My theory is that the non bipedal frogs are kind of like their equivalent of monkeys. Like they share a common ancestor and have similar genetic features but fill a different evolutionary niche that doesn‚Äôt require a strong frontal cortex or capacity for advanced sapience. So Frobert would be something like Beelzebufo sapiens whereas the ones you catch are like Lithobates catesbeianus or something
    Ohh talk smart to me again
    Unrelated Note: the octopus neighbor is missing from the sillhouettes in the museum
        That irks me as well, I want to see how that evolutionary tree works

The frog cage thing actually looks really cool.
Phrog
I was curious what would happen if I gifted a frog to one of the frog villagers [This is what happened](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/gbpg4g/jeremiah_what_i_gifted_him_a_frog_today_and_he/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
Can‚Äôt wait to gift this to Henry to see how he will handle it :D
So THAT‚ÄôS where Drift went when he moved off my island
This game raises a lot of questions. Why do they sell hamster cages and whats the difference between the hamster in the cages and the hamster villagers? Whats in a sandwich? Why are dog houses a thing?
    Don't forget the cat tree
Could someone explain as trying so hard to understand the frog comment/punüò≠
    Some villagers are literally frogs, just not the realistic kind
        Yes, thank you! üòÅ
        My Henry looks just like that!
    It's a game where the villagers are animals and you are catching animals.
Im gonna catch one and give it to my frog villager.
I feel like this is why they removed Tortimer from the game. Would make catching snapping turtles a lot weirder.
[deleted]
    Oh no
I feel bad bc I caught one in front of Henry üòÇ
I know. I have two Birds as neighbors and I gave them both birdbaths as gifts.
you can catch frogs??
This makes me so uncomfortable. 
Also the rabbit, or pig or normal animal decor is sketchy.  Like ‚Ä¶ why can I have a hamster in a cage and as a neighbor?
I just got huck and I think he‚Äôs a frog?
I finally caught one on a trip across the pond yesterday!
Yes!!!!
I just caught one too!!! I was so excited!
It's aware!
Oh my god
Henry!
Hi can I come to your island and do some fishing/visit? :)
YES
But hey that‚Äôs just a theory‚Ä¶
Funny cuz Frobert moved into my town, and I'm starting to think those legs would look good on my barbecue.
