[[how did my villager get this shirt]]


no one ever visits my island and it’s not in any of my custom designs????!!!!! There are no words 


However Is it just me or is he pulling that shirt off
    100% I have to give 10s where 10s are due
        This comment made me snort, bless you 😂
    omg hi 😂
    Just u
He looks like someone who would wear that shirt lol
    I’ve been wanting to get rid of him but….he’s earned his stay
        Took me months to get rid of him - now I sometimes miss him.
            It also took me months to get rid of him 😭😭😭😭
            He was my favourite villager !! One of my first ones (my passport picture is still a selfie with him hahah) but my island is pink themed and his house didn’t work </3 forever missing Harry lol
                Pink themed? Can I visit?
                    Very very pink 😂 I don’t have a switch membership at the moment :( but my dream address is >> DA-6207-0522-1124 
If you wanted to visit by dream! If you do let me know what you think! 🩷
                        Thanks! I’d love to check it out
        I'm trying to ditch him too
        🤣🤣🤣🤣
        Earned? How? 😏
    Yeah I think he earned that shirt by lovingly cherishing DILFS.
So, this is just a guess, but if the villager was wearing a shirt with custom design, the person that created the custom design updated it to what you see now.
    I didn't realize that was even a possibility!!
        I actually just learned that it might be a possibility the other day. I laid out an entire path, and then I went to go save some other custom designs and overwrote my path designs with a new design. I came back out and my whole island was so messed up because my path changed to the design I saved over where the path used to be… I don’t know why that never even occurred to me before. I just assumed that once you used a design, it was there until you changed it! So I started wondering what would happen to my island if the designers I used just decided to delete all of their designs. So… guess this confirms that haha
            No, the designs are saved on your island and switch. They don't get overwritten when the designer deletes or changes them.
            I use this property to change out signs at the villagers houses - when they turn over to a new one, I find a portrait and overwrite the old design’s save slot.
    Thanks haha I was shook
    Omg, I knew that could happen if I overwrite a save but had no idea it could still happen if the creator changed the design!!
    Found my new Animal Crossing prank 😏
    Omaigaaa…. That’s so funny (and inappropriate, I know)
    Omg the pranks you could do. That’s hilarious.
    That's hilarious
The look on your face is hilarious

        “are you seeing this shit rn”
            It's a Jim Halpert glance at the camera for sure
If you had gotten your villager from someone’s island sometimes they will wear custom design clothing from their old island
    that's what i was gonna say too.
    This is my thought. When I first got the game I wasn’t online & made outfits based on shows I’d worked on. Including the Jerk Shirt from the show Dan Vs. 

Fast forward & I get Nintendo online, have some friends on my island & swap out some of my villagers who had worn that shirt. 

Years later I get a letter from Nintendo saying that design was flagged for violating decency rule (or whatever it was, I forget now) even though there were plenty of jerk shirts on the custom store that aren’t mine. 

My friends’ theory is that one of my villagers ended up on someone’s island (outside our group) & reported it. Because one of my villagers that ended up on a friend’s island wore that shirt (but they didn’t report).
    This is the correct answer.
The person must have put it in your Abel’s did you check? You can remove it and I’m pretty sure I know who this person was since they did the same with me
    Ok im gonna look into this thanks!!!
        Should be under your custom clothing spot. Once you remove it they will no longer wear it or if they do just go to residential services once you removed it.
    What do you mean by this? I didn't even realize it was possible to customize a shirt to give to your villager. For example if I want to wear a custom shirt I have to go into my custom patterns either from the clothing store or from my nook phone and then just apply that vision pattern to myself, but it's not ever an actual physical item that sits in my storage. (If that makes any sense lol) Have I missed something really cool that I can do after playing this game for 2 years?????🤞🏽🤞🏽🤞🏽😁😁😁
        The row of clothes against the back wall at Able’s can be replaced with custom designs (either from you or a visitor). After you’ve placed a custom design there your villagers may start wearing it.
            Can I ask a really noob question...how do you replace the styles at the back? I've gotten some cool designs but don't know how to change the designs at the back of the shop. TIA
                Just face the clothes wall and press A! It’ll ask you if you want to wear the current design, save it, or replace it with your own design.
                    Nice! Thanks for advice. So simple,yet effective 😃
                        No problem. I had to figure this out recently after someone left juicy peach designs in my store!
                            I'm sorry for laughing but... 🤣 People are too creative for their own good. I can imagine your villager now 🍑
                                They were honestly really well done but my villagers don’t deserve that 😖
                            I got the juicy peaches too hahaha, I haven’t yet swapped it out 😅
This is one of the funniest posts I’ve ever seen… like ever
This is so funny omfg. YOU AND ME BOTH HARRY
He just loves Dilfs💀💀😭
That’s so funny!
Did u get him from someone else's village, by chance?
    Nope, he just popped up after I stopped playing the game for a while 😭😭
        Ohhhhh if you have visited someone's island, even for a trade or something simple and they lived in their island but they got booted, they will spawn in your island if you have a vacant villager home. So that person might have dressed em that way. Sometimes when you speak to them, they'll discuss their old island with you
harry, I feel you. I also love DILFS.
He bought it with his hard earned cash and he’s just trying something out. I’m proud of him for living his truth 🙌🥹
why does this look so crisp compared to my screen caps
I love it 😆😆 on mine, Henry has a pink and black shirt that says ✨bìtch pls✨ that he wears all the time. No idea where it came from
I cannot stop laughing 😆
Idk but I want it
I mean… same ❤️😍
Does anyone have the code for this pattern????

I want it.
i’m actually screaming 💀
God I freaking LOVE Harry. He is so criminally underrated!
😂😂😂
LMFAOOOOO I NEED IT 😂😂
Okay I have Harry too and I’m gonna need to make him this shirt myself, a serve is a serve.
He's just like me fr
One of my villagers randomly has a shirt that says “don’t fuck with me” literally out of nowhere so… same dude idk where these are coming from
Why does your character look like that one 2023 meme where the black guy in the purple suit is walking down the road and people are following him looking at his ass? Or is it just me
That shirt on OP looks like saggy tits.
    Utters even—
    LOL
HELP MEEEE
😂😂😂omg this is great
Funniest thing I’ve seen today!
Lmfaoooo
🤣
I need that shirt 😂😂
😂
me too Harry, me too.
If he doesn't want the shirt anymore, can I have it?
Hahahaha hahahaha omg I would die from laughter if this happened to me
He’s just like me
Able sisters
Idk but I want it
So basically if you have a custom shirt displayed in able sisters your viligers have a chance of wearing them.
Okay but he's right and he deserves to say it
Lmao same
Don’t shame him he has his tastes 😒
    💀.
he said what he said.
lmfaoooohbushusjzuh 💀💀✋✋
Carefully
LMFAOOOO??
I’m literally howling how did he get it 😭😭
😂😂😂😂 now wait a minute
Someone just stole your content!

    Ohhhhh if you have visited someone's island, even for a trade or something simple and they lived in their island but they got booted, they will spawn in your island if you have a vacant villager home. So that person might have dressed em that way. Sometimes when you speak to them, they'll discuss their old island with you
