[[My feelings.]]





I want Isabelle to tell us who the island visitor is that day instead of just â€˜no news todayâ€™
    Yes, so much this. The daily announcements feel like they are almost completely worthless save for when they tell you about a meteor shower. It makes absolutely zero sense that she doesn't tell you that someone is on the island. Even for someone like Redd she tells you like the first time, and then never tells you again.
    Ohh man, I love this idea. Would help avoid my concern of just... never being able to find CJ/Flick/Samarah/etc. I watched a vid the other day where someone just HAPPENED to come across CJ who was trapped behind a building with trees/items blocking him in. Yikes.
    She's pretty much useless on my island. I've have 5 meteor showers on my island and she's only told me once.
        Technically she only tells you when it is a full meteor shower, you can still have random shooting stars whenever the sky is clear, but in those cases there are typically fewer and they don't go the whole night. When she announces that there will be a meteor shower you get shooting stars all night long, celest will always show up, and you tend to get far more of them in a group and far more often.
            OK, thank you I didn't know it had to be a full shower. I always just saw Celeste and the stars and would be pissed she didn't tell me in announcements.
                Celeste can still appear other times, it seems she has at least a chance to appear any day there are shooting stars (I have had days where she didn't seem to appear) and I believe I have had her the day after as well. But on days that it is announced it is guaranteed that she is there.
                    Itâ€™s not always guaranteed. I had her consistently on May 14th with an announced shower, then she stopped spawning after time traveling a few times.
                        I haven't time traveled like that, only ever use it to get something I missed, so I can't really say whether that is specifically due to time travelling or not. I have just never seen it as of yet where the announcement is made and she doesn't show up.

Can't really say if it is just a really high chance I guess or if time travelling potentially messes it up (like perhaps the system keeps track of how many diys you have gotten, or something like that).
            Hasn't happened to me once.
                Having her announce a meteor shower? It isn't common that is for sure, I have had it twice and I feel like I have been incredibly lucky.
    I was thinking that too! In ACNL and possibly other games, there was a police station and you could ask about special visitors. They'd tell you who was visiting. It was awesome.

        I am guessing you mean flick, and I think he is a guy. Also he is a lizard. And ya it sucks having stuff left over, selling it all to then find out you could have gotten 50 percent more.
            I thought he was a dragon!
                No he is a chameleon according to the wiki. Which I mean kind of makes sense since lizards eat bugs, and they chose an otter for fish.
                    Isn't the fish guy a beaver?
                        Oh yes, my mistake, looked it up and he is a beaver. I thought otter originally because his tail doesn't look flat and wide enough, also couldn't see his teeth very well, but looking at a head on picture of him, he looks far more like a beaver. Which actually makes them picking a beaver interesting because beavers don't eat fish. Kind of odd.
            Nah she is definitely a bug buying alien.

Preach! Also manilla clams should stack.
    They should at least stack in our home storage. Between them and fossils my storage is almost full.
        The bait is stackable. You have to craft the class in order to save space, if you are saving them. But, they have no other use, so why are you storing them? They sell for 100 bells each, while the bait sells for 200.
        Why are you storing fossils?
            Not op but I store them because I've caught them all and am lazy. I usually let 20 or so stack up and then take em to get ID'd, then sell them for about 100k
    And not be required to be crafted into bait when they have no other use and unless they go unused are 100% chance bring crafted into bait
        what exactly do you mean
            Manila clams have no use other than for bait so why do we need to craft them into bait when itâ€™s their only function? Plus itâ€™s a 1:1 ratio so itâ€™s not like you need multiple to make 1 bait.
                This is exactly why you keep work benches in beaches
                the only thing thats in bait is the clams tho how else would u....make it?
                    I think the point is, why do we have to craft them at all? Why can't we just straight-up use the clams as bait
                        oh that makes a lot more sense! thank you, the way it was said originally was really confusing to me

                    >would be way too easy


I'd like to remind you we are talking about Animal Crossing. Challenge as never been the series' strong point.


>if you could just dig the bait up!


The point here is that you *can* just dig the bait up. There's just an arbitrary extra step between digging it up and being able to use it.


It's like if you couldn't mine iron, you could only mine ore. And you had to go back and individualy turn each ore you collect into an Iron. And also ore doesn't stack.
                    Too easy? What exactly is challenging about crafting manila clams into bait one by one?  Annoying is what it is.
    #stackmanillas2020
Yes! Or what if I could at least call them and ask what they're up to?
    Yep, that would be way more immersive while still being extremely useful. After calling them, they could appear temporarily on your map tho (because they couldn't really "explain" where they are if they are just roaming around on the island).
    Omg that's what I was saying too, we have a stupid phone, yet we can't text our villagers basic questions like "where are you?" or "do you need me to bring you anything?"
    I feel that just being on the map isn't in the spirit of the game. But the phone just makes sense.
    I like this idea way better! It doesn't seem quite right to know where they are at all times (not that I wouldn't appreciate that lol... but stalker much?). That would be such a cool feature of the nook phone though!!
They should make a Find My Friends for the Nookphone lol
    Yesssss!
And Celeste! One of my villagers tell me sheâ€™s on the island and I spend fifteen minutes trying to find her!
I think this meme is getting played out
    On every animal crossing subreddit I always see on of these formats
        Me too. This must be stopped
            Have you been on r/animalcrossing ? All you see are these kinda of memes and pictures of peopleâ€™s rooms.
                Yuuuuup. I donâ€™t know why it annoys me so much, but my eyes hurt from rolling them so often
                    Exactly.
    Seriously. Even if what the OP is asking for is a good idea they all just come off as whiny now.
        This.
Also, should be able to buy multiple things at once at Ables.
Also where any visitors to your island are
    THIS. If my friends are here I donâ€™t wanna have to search for them
We gotta get our islanders chipped so we can track 'em!
When I canâ€™t find them on the island I usually find them wandering around in the museum. It always kills me ðŸ˜‚
Talking about that yesterday with my fiancee: pretty frustrating to locate a villagers when you went to offer a simple gift.

And honestly, idk how the developers doesn't think about that. That's so obvious.
But ACNH is one of the worst optimized game. Really enjoyable but so much obvious ideas in EVERY games since 2000 was skipped (Crafting at home? No shortcuts for your materials. Crafting one by one. 2minutes when someone traveling to an island and quit, the little loading when you pass in terraforming mode on/off can get on your nerves if you forget one hole or anything, impossibly to do something when someone is on your island or if your doors are open etc)

Really, after more than 400 hours on the game, I'm half assed between getting used of all this stuff and depression. I don't ask anything, just little updates here and here to correct some things for making the game more comfortable. No big deal. And seriously, the game is a battery eater. Even Breath of the wild (another level if you ask me !) Is SO MUCH BETTER optimized in handled mode. I have a Gen 1 Switch and oof.
New to AC, Nook's Veterinary Services. Grand opening 50% off pet chipping!
Don't need villager radar but would like guest radar so I know where my friends are when they visit
 Didnâ€™t a New Leaf have a megaphone? I remember yelling my villagerâ€™s names through the 3DS mike. Good times.
And where visitors/hosts are! But that might not be good for hide and seek
villagers i dont mind so much, visitors, i wanna see where the player visitors are at
I think instead of then appearing on the map, we should have an app on the NookPhone to text or call villagers.
Donâ€™t want to play find the villagers? ðŸ˜‚ 

I get you. I always have 1 villager hiding.
All these updates are coming soon..

https://youtu.be/Qoo-cmQ20Tk











.....not.
I need a tracker on each and every little fucker, or at least tell me when theyâ€™re inside a building
In an earlier AC game, wasn't there a megaphone that could be used to call for villagers?
I miss the megaphone feature from new leaf
Maraudersâ€™ map style! It would be very useful when you have to return a lost object and you canâ€™t find the owner anywhere lol
And where daisy mae is
Or they should just add the megaphones back into the game. They were in new leaf and were pretty handy for finding villagers. Also gave you another way to annoy the villagers you donâ€™t like lmao.
I spent all day looking for audie to give her some dress I didn't like
True, I always have to run around the island trying to find Coach to see if he wants to leave already...
    Wow this really resonates with me
*implants microchips in my villagers to track their location*
No i dont think you should like why would you need to do that it just sounds creepy but i do agree that gish bait should be sold in the nook shop
Yes I agree
And you should be able to see your friends on the map when you're playing together ðŸ“¢
Also visitors. And ask Isabelle what your rating is over your phone.
And players on your island
Maybe but the one thing I really need is that you can see another players cursor like yours on the map similar to Minecraft.
Yes letâ€™s put the Patriot Act into the game

/s
Same with visitors!
Yes! I also want to know where visitors are when they come! Instead of having to constantly ask "Uhh where are you?" Lol
and visitors on your island/other players!!
True or a map of where visitors are!!
I've been saying that about about the guest characters. Like make a turnip for Daisy Mae, a bug for Flick, a fish for C.J., etc. to let us know where they are. One day I happened to find C.J. on my 3rd level incline in the woods (behind all my cedar trees) as I was visiting camper at my campsite. Had I not gone for that specific purpose I would have never known he was there.
and where your visitors are
Yes! And see other players on your island!!
And visitors
And guest/friends !
my dumbass thought you were talking about minecraft and forgot i was in the acnh sub
I also feel this way about visitors.
And people who visit
Nah, then people will not walk around their island to seek them.  Thatâ€™s part of the fun is the hide and seek game this game unintentionally force you to play.
    It should be an upgrade. Anything that can make play slightly more fluid should be an upgrade
        There should definitely be a lot of upgrade. I magazine going outside of your house and being able to use the right analog stick to move the camera like in your house.
There should be mini games to earn bells!
I'd love to battle against other villagers for bells
Nintendo addressed this and said that they couldnâ€™t because they believed it would take up too much of the map room. The directors of the game wanted the game to seem uncluttered in every area including the map
They did have a function in New Leaf for this, using the microphone you could call out and they'd answer with a visable text bubble. I really hope they add back this function or something similiar.
Honestly, I just want the Megaphone back, damn.. and the Piko hammer too. ðŸ˜”
Almost right. You should be able to phone them to get a ping on the map.
What are we, the gestapo?
Im sure the government wants the same thing for its residents too
Word!
Itâ€™s always been the down side of every version
And friends on your island.
I thought about this too, but my thought/prediction was that they wanted to make the game a bit realistic (yeah, I know. Nothing about the game is really realistic). Because Iâ€™m real life you canâ€™t pull up a map and see where your friends are.

Edit: WAIT THE MAP IS AN APP! ðŸ¤¦
Game needs a huge QOL update
Pls
I mean they wonâ€™t implement things like this. Those things will be set in stone. Same goes for why I have to put all items each away and not all together.
This has been an issue since the original and it doesnâ€™t bother me anymore
I think its because Nintendo doesn't want nookphones to be too convenient, otherwise it'd just turn into even more excuses to make those boomer comics, only in the style of animal crossing, because that would kind of ruin the style. Just my theory.
don't think so. that will just make them more like robots instead of real villagers in the small island.
I like having to look for them. Too much time is spent staring at mini maps and waypoints nowadays.
omg yes, i totally need this ; n ; sometimes i just want to gift nice clothes but they are just hidden somewhere!
It's such an easy going game, why does EVERYTHING need to be so easy? It isn't that hard finding villagers.
i like it the way it is, the older games didn't have it this one shouldn't either.
They have this in rune factory 4 and itâ€™s hella useful!
Yes microchip all the animals and know where they are at all times lol
Yes, I was in a panic when I couldnâ€™t find Antonio
They could even justify it in canon. Maybe when you become good friends with a villager, they offer to share their gps coordinates with you via their nook phone
 A Marauderâ€™s Map for ACNH? Iâ€™m in.
Guys, you do realize that animal crossing is not sims and itâ€™s not supposed to be convenient
hi everyone! I'm brand new and would love friends to visit my island. :) My friend code is: SW-0085-8459-0122. Welcome to Biggie Boy Island, named after my dog. :)
Especially when they are visiting the museum... there is no way to figure out where they are lol
THANK YOU!
Haha facts right here .
rip megaphone from acnl
THIS
Say it louder for the people in the back!!

I'd like to remind you we are talking about Animal Crossing. Challenge as never been the series' strong point.


>if you could just dig the bait up!


The point here is that you *can* just dig the bait up. There's just an arbitrary extra step between digging it up and being able to use it.


It's like if you couldn't mine iron, you could only mine ore. And you had to go back and individualy turn each ore you collect into an Iron. And also ore doesn't stack.
        Too easy? What exactly is challenging about crafting manila clams into bait one by one?  Annoying is what it is.
Have you been on r/animalcrossing ? All you see are these kinda of memes and pictures of peopleâ€™s rooms.
    Yuuuuup. I donâ€™t know why it annoys me so much, but my eyes hurt from rolling them so often
        Exactly.
Celeste can still appear other times, it seems she has at least a chance to appear any day there are shooting stars (I have had days where she didn't seem to appear) and I believe I have had her the day after as well. But on days that it is announced it is guaranteed that she is there.
    Itâ€™s not always guaranteed. I had her consistently on May 14th with an announced shower, then she stopped spawning after time traveling a few times.
        I haven't time traveled like that, only ever use it to get something I missed, so I can't really say whether that is specifically due to time travelling or not. I have just never seen it as of yet where the announcement is made and she doesn't show up.

Can't really say if it is just a really high chance I guess or if time travelling potentially messes it up (like perhaps the system keeps track of how many diys you have gotten, or something like that).
Having her announce a meteor shower? It isn't common that is for sure, I have had it twice and I feel like I have been incredibly lucky.
No he is a chameleon according to the wiki. Which I mean kind of makes sense since lizards eat bugs, and they chose an otter for fish.
    Isn't the fish guy a beaver?
        Oh yes, my mistake, looked it up and he is a beaver. I thought otter originally because his tail doesn't look flat and wide enough, also couldn't see his teeth very well, but looking at a head on picture of him, he looks far more like a beaver. Which actually makes them picking a beaver interesting because beavers don't eat fish. Kind of odd.
This is exactly why you keep work benches in beaches
the only thing thats in bait is the clams tho how else would u....make it?
    I think the point is, why do we have to craft them at all? Why can't we just straight-up use the clams as bait
