[[Bagging ain’t dead!!]]


Proof


I mean there’s no way for the game to differentiate between somebody actually being bad and is therefore in the back and somebody purposefully driving bad to get the food items. Stuff like this will never fully be gone but the devs tried at least…
    I think it’s actually much better and the packs are tighter, this was just very lucky
        Yeah definitely a lucky clip, you only get double bullet with boo or bad lag
            and there was a well timed blue shell to top it off
        Go in versus mode and turn on only the good powerups and then you get infinite bagging
    Yea. Game is simply set to not be competitive in an appropriate way.
        Finally some people are coming to terms with this about their Nintendo games
            Nintendo is just like that. It’s so strange but I kind of get it at the same time.
    Just curious what did they change to address it?
Double bills wtf??
    I had one and stole the other with a boo 👻
        That’s incredibly lucky. As well as the last minute blue shell to get u into first lol
    Yeah, it's possible with a boo. I've seen it before.
Granted I don’t play at meta level myself but from an appreciator perspective I actually like the change. It forces you to be more creative/dynamic about how you scum for good items lol
You can still bag by dropping down to 12th and then getting the next set of items. Especially considering the 2nd set usually always has a double box
Sadly
Nice double bills, but I'd like to ask you something, do you find it harder to get past the pack in the new update? Because even though I might dislike bagging, when it worked out for me I liked that it really helped me get through the annoying onslaught of shells and boomerangs and shit.
Great finish great luck. Glad you finished first after first tried to leave a bomb behind.

    I think you'll see a strategy similar to bagging develop now - intentionally driving horribly and then actually trying when they find a bullet bill.
        That strategy is as old as Nintendo.
            Well, yeah. But people are going to be doing it a lot more often with the recent rule changes.
        I would still call this bagging. Any intentionally bad play for items is bagging
    I slowed down earlier in the clip and had a shock dodge. Capture is only 30 sec on the switch though. I’m qualifying it as a bag because I did hang back on purpose for better gems and this is what I got
        play the game
            I don't have much skin in this game, but they literally are. Do you mean they should play the game as you want them to?
                Exactly what he means. They all say the same two things…one is bagging bad. Two is don’t play whatever the current meta is. Gets annoying
Got Blessed‼️
Killing it probably wasn't the goal, but making it more difficult and less viable than what it was. It will take some time before the verdict is in, but the results look promising so far.
    I actually like  the update better, less lightnings and everyone stays closer together. I’m just showing that it takes one solid push forwards I. Order to “bag”. No stopping or slowing down, just hanging back and then making your push at the right time
that Blue Shell was in on the whole thing too
…and this is why I advocate for skill only lobbies
Hooray…
Get a life
BAGGING IS JUST A CHEAP TACTIC TO MAKE WEAK RACERS STRONGER!!!
play the game
    this is the game, it is being played
    ...however you like. Louder for those in the back!

        im not doing another chain of me just saying play the game and you just posting salt emojis
            Ok, champ. It's fine for me.
What does bagging mean
    Its when you purposely drop down to a bad placement to get good items.

Before wave 6 came bagging was heavily used on some tracks.

Now Nintendo nerfed it to if you go through the same item set for too long you will just start getting weaker items
    as someone who has not played this game almost at all, i can tell it means sand bagging to get better items and then using them all at the last second to catch up and in this case win.
Baggers are in total denial mode. Bagging is definitely dead, just not worth it anymore.
    I smell copium
Is it just me but what’s bagging?
Told y'all
Mario kart is WoN by sKiLL!!
    it is.
    This is a lucky pull. Bagging does require skill. You know, you won't always get the items you need at the right moment. Same thing goes for frontrunning: you won't always get proper defensive items for red shells and blue shells.
        Yes dude you are proving my point.  Being the best racer gets you a position between 7th and first, depending on the items at play..... and being the worst racer gets you a place between last and 5th, again, depending on the items at play.  The average skill racer gets a range from last to first.  Luck is more influential than anything else in this game.  Why do tournament smash players play on a flat stage with no items??
Play the game
    🧂🧂🧂
Your sayin this like it takes skills and not ruining the game
    This is a lucky pull. Bagging does require skill. You won't always get crazy pulls so you have to manage your items properly.
i don’t think bagging will every be dead if you can pull 2 bullet bills
    Bro got second bullet bill with a Boo
Do you know what the latest version number is?
BAG AIN'T DEAD BAG AINT DEAD BAG AIN'T DEAD lol

That was so clean though
