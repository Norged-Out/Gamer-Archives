[[I have no words to describe how angry I am right now.]]





Honestly second place with that build in coconut mall is very impressive. I‚Äôd be taking a huge L
If you had looked at the map before you threw the red shell you could have seen the blue coming‚Ä¶ the timing was so tight though. Probably best would have been to red him right before the finish, just after the blue targeted him for being in first. Maybe just an impossible scenario
    With how close OP was to the finish line, i'm pretty positive the other player would have barely crossed the line before the blue shell detonates. Fab boosted right before being hit by OP's red shell, that alone should have been enough to beat the blue shell, albeit barely. Since OP was behind, those milliseconds were enough for the blue shell to catch them before the line.

All honesty, I don't know what should have been done here. Maybe charging a stronger turbo at that corner might have done it since OP is a kart, but honestly the timing is so tight here it might have been doomed to start.
    I know but it was still very frustrating lol

Welcome to mk8(dx) online
    Indeed lol
based name, fifa does suck
    Haha yeah did that ages ago as a joke. Just stuck.
You just got boned. Pun entirely intended
Think he could‚Äôve drifted a bit longer to get the boost and use that to cross before the blue shell hit him
    What I was gonna say, started the final drifted too late, could have got an orange mini turbo and maybe reached the line
Start a fire
    I considered it.
It could have been worse. A lot worse.
    I know but still! I WAS ABOUT TO FINISH!!
Welcome to Mario Kart kid üòÜ
    Indeed haha
Name is perfect
    Ty lmao
It's counter intuitive (and kinda difficult) but if you can hit yourself with another item, you can use the I-frames to tank the blue shell. The recovery animation is shorter.
Happens to the best of us lol

Oh mannnnnnnn üë®
You just got, DRY BONER'D üó£
Nah from 1 to 2 is ok!

Today I was 2nd and chose to try to red shell #1, guess what as soon as I sent out my shell I ended up Mario karted to #9 üò≠
    Damn that's rough lmao
Skill issue. /s
your lucky you still got second my guy
    Yeah but gahh. I was like 1 cm off the finish line! Lmao
        your feelings are definitely justified, but in Mario Kart you take what you can get haha the game is so ruthless sometimes
I would've thundercunted my fucking controller that's sum bullshit
Ouch, we've all been there it sucks.

Bro it's your fault, look at the minimap next time before catching up to first.
    In a normal scenario, yes, but the blue came out just one second ahead and he wouldn‚Äôt have had time to react
        No the blue was already out when he was second, just look at the minimap how much time he to slow down
            Wario covered the shell icon before he used the red shell. He wouldn‚Äôt have had much time even if the blue did come out 0.5 secs earlier
                No, blue was out before the red
                    That‚Äôs literally what I said.

I‚Äôm saying that the moment before he launched his red, the blue was covered by Wario so he couldn‚Äôt notice it.
                        He could see it when Mario throwed it
                            Nobody‚Äôs gonna look at the map 24/7 lmao
Could‚Äôve been worse
I can think of several words to describe it.
Why did you hit your blue shell defence?
    Because if you‚Äôre holding defense or triple defense spinning around your kart, then the Blue will ‚Äútake it out‚Äù.
        No like the dude in front of them was gonna take it, but they threw the red shell and took it instead
            Idk
2nd place isnt bad considering the cup is awarded for average.   
Even if online youll still get a good rank.   


That being said, 1st place is the worst place for 2nd place to be, if you get hit while you are in 3rd place you might even end up 7th
    It was online
Real
Bad Karma 101
Skill issue
Oof
Bros switch is not living to see another day
Rest in Peace OP. This happens to me too many times to count.
