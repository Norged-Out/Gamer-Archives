[[The Mario Kart 8 Deluxe roster and their respective system of origin!]]





Luigi should be under arcade because Mario Bros. arcade
    Ah you're right. I forgot lol.
        If you wanna go back even further, the Mario Bros. Game & Watch game actually came out earlier than that.
Now that I think about it, this is probably why Peachette was added: She's the only character on the roster that originates from a Switch title.
    I definitely didn’t think about it until now either. Kinda weird to think she’s the only character younger than the game. Like she couldn’t have been on the original roster lol
    I tought it was wiiu?
        Peachette's first appearance is in New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe on the Switch
Donkey Kong would technically not be in arcade since Cranky Kong is the original DK.
Put DK to the SNES era since he did originate from the DKC games. The “DK” from the arcade era was actually Cranky Kong
    tbh i think that’s getting a bit too technical, not saying you’re wrong but i think it’s much simpler to just say he’s from arcade
Donkey Kong is SNES, you're thinking of Cranky Kong in the arcade who admittedly would be a great MK character
Peachette was in tour as well
    True but she first appeared in Bros U Deluxe on Switch as the exclusive Toadette form via the crown.
        I forgot that game existed
            As it stands, Peachette is the sole character from a Switch game in Mario Kart.
