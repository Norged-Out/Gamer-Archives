[[New Corrupted Weapons]]





Wow!!!! Cube gun looking bad asf 😳😳😳🔥 look at that damage and magazine
    I already theorized before this corrupted version of doing a overheat build(because ive gotten a bunch of gear to synergize) using cube gun and probably the lmg as they are the only overheat weapons ive found. So it is technically a continuous fire build also with focusing shard ring and maybe that mutator too.
        There's a laser in nerud that overheats. Plasma cutter I think
Awesome!

Now how on earth did you get all 5 so fast?
    In the video it shows he has over 80 million money... so safe to assume they modded in the currency to buy everything
    Beats me too 😂 I found this video on Youtube literally a couple of minutes after the patch dropped.
    With a friend, you can just save scum pretty easily I believe.

Sell them to Cass, buy, quit game, etc
        *could

The ability to sell them was patched out some time ago, meaning that strat is impossible without mods
            Ooooh. I'm a bit outdated then.

Then most likely modded.
            Gladly i left 10 on cassie, 9 on my char and today already got 2 weapons in 30min


But farm the remaining ones isnt fun, even on apocalipse is hard spawn aberrations


I really hate this event and will be a lot worse after event end if i dont get the remaining shards now...
        No more
    By playing the game for 500 hours and just having the materials laying around probably.
        Corrupted shards stop stacking at 10
            Then just modding.
            Oh really? Wow ok huh i didnt know that and been holding 10 for a while. Why in the world would they cap so low?
Does anyone know if you buy corrupted savior can you re-purchase the normal version again?
    You can purchase it again. You don't need to do another campaign run.
        Oh that’s awesome was worried I’d have to do another HC run
Corrupted savior is my new favorite weapon. Damn that I missed that thing haha
    Same
Nice 👌🏻
Sexy
Outside of mods, only legit way would be to sell to multiple vendors prior to it being patched to not be possible, then buying them all back for this occasion.
    Multiple vendors worked? Damm....i only left 10 on cassie


I wont sure if reggie etc could store them, during that time someone posted that mcgabe could reset inventory when close game so i avoided...
        I mean in theory. I never tested it either
is it corrupted shard event also?
    Yes indeed until March 5th.
        awesome, thank you
But does anyone know if they added any new mutators?
    Not yet. This is just a balance patch I have herd. Most likely the next dlc will have new mutators.
        Last event featured new mutators/enemy modifiers, so it's possible. But probably unlikely
    killed 1 so far, no mutator drop.
        update. killed 11 so far still no mutator.
    i just want shocker so bad. i know it’s not great but it looks cool as shit when it hits on worlds edge and it refuses to drop on my main character.
        It's great on words edge for add control! Who told ya it wasn't good on that weapon?
            i think it’s just the krell axe meta in this sub. because it doesn’t do the same broken shock damage, but all i need it to do is proc shock, and worlds edge hits the stack limit by touching anything and it goes through walls. 

unfortunately on my main character shocker and stone of malevolence are at the bottom of my loot pool so it’s been hard going rarely running into aberrations. on my hard core attempts i got it almost immediately.
Corrupted Weapons in a list:

Arbalest

Cube Gun

Aphelion

Savior

Nebula

Sorrow
I got 3 new mutataors. Don't know if they are ones I missed last time, but I don't think so.
I got all 5 weapons in 2 days playing adventure on veteran, and N'erud drops loads more than the other planets.
6 aberrations per run at least.
Maybe I'm just lucky.
Does anyone know if you get the corrupted Cube Gun, if you will still be able to get the Archon archetype? Or does it have to be the standard Cube Gun? I have enough to buy it, but I am still working on getting Archon
    You can always have somebody else open up the door for you, but even if you did convert it you would be able to generate a new labyrinth (or join somebody else's) and grab the base gun again anyhow.
        Thank you!

You're welcome!
