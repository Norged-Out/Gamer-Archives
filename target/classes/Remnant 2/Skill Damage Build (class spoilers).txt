[[Skill Damage Build (class spoilers)]]


I am a Engineer/Archon  popping the turret down, setting it to overdrive and either huddling in the bubble for bosses I need to dodge or going full ham on the ones I can burst down. Are there any rings or necklaces you would suggest. I like the class combo even if Summoner would give more skill damage while even just the turret is out (it counts as a summon for summoner as I was explained to) 

Anyways I was wondering if there were any items in particular that I should have a focus on grabbing? I'm doing just adventure atm.


The hyperconductor amulet is a good option. Im looking for it myself. Gives you two charges for havoc form and doubles your turret ammo. But it increases cooldown by 50% and reduces max power gen by 15%. Might be worth it still.
    So gives more bursts I see. 

Sounds like a N'erud item, is it a random or is it an event thing? If it's that friggin water rush puzzle I'm going to cry.
        N’erud. Gotta roll the train station side dungeon. Apparently theres a hidden crawl space you can get into by breaking something at the end of the event. Rolled it twice before and completely missed it cuz i didn’t know about the amulet. Havnt rolled it again yet.
            Yeah I found it on a run last night, the grate is on the left before you go up the ladder when doing the train segment at the end of the dungeon.
                Importantly you have to go through the grate DURING the timed event. If you finish the event without grabbing it, you can't go back after.
                    Oh really?? Makes sense why i miss it then
                    Yeah that's my bad for not clarifying, thanks dude!
            The murder train or a wreckage of train carts? Because I have a wreckage of train carts in my Hatchery and I roll the murder train kinda often.
                Its the side dungeon called terminus station. Moving death train i guess lol
    Do you know what happens with hyperconductor and the summoner minions?
        I saw video where you get 2 or 4 charges to summo  but you won’t be able to summon more than the usual 2 or 1.
            Lame. Thank you.
Eng + Archon seems to be focused on the Archon side if anything 

Because turrets gives insane amount of mod power (unless your entire focus is to be in Havoc form?)

I think Handler will be better for you if you want total skill damage
    So I've either dropped Gatling gun and set it to overdrive while rocking explosives/chain lightning so it hard focused the boss and dome up to just no brain, or repeat step one and two then hop into Havoc form because GOOD LORD THAT'S A LOT OF DAMAGE. I ONE PHASE WORLD BOSSES LIKE THIS AT GEAR SCORE ZERO. 

the only one I didn't one phase was Progenitor because my lightning wasn't hitting it for whatever reason. But the time before it did?

Edit: I totally forgot to mention this: the turrets give mod gen?! I should try that out, just spam mods with it second class some time. Any kids you suggest?

All turrets give mod power, the flamer especially more if paired with the ring of malevolence

I'm personally playing with prismatic driver and starshot
        Understandable
            I don't know what mods are fun to spam. I'm ADHD and forgot to fully type out my message... 

Still, rocking a mod focus rather than a skill focus would mean I can be adaptable for playstyle and keep my friend feeling like they're not just set to one style of they play alone.
