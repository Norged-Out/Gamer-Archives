[[Does ghost ship health scale per crew size]]


Just an honest little question bc I'd like to grind for the ghost captain sails but I'm mostly solo slooping and I wonder if it'd be more efficient to just wait for people to crew a ship. I've never attempted a ghost ship voyage/ sea of the damned solo lol.


As a solo slooper here, I can confirm that the ghost ships take 1-3 shots each, the intermediate boss ships take 9-10 shots, and the Burning Blade is roughly twice that. Whether it scales with crew size, I'm not sure, but it seems this may be the information you're looking for.

It's totally doable as a solo grind, but you really do need to be on top of your bailing and repairs, especially if you make the mistake of letting one of the ships pass through you. I recommend picking a single spot in their orbit and just rotating for shot angle as the ships approach.

Religious cannonball counter here. 

Intermediate bosses are 10 shots always. Flameheart is actually only 15
        Thank you
    Yep first time soloing this voyage I didn’t think it’d be a big deal to let one “ram” me since they’re ghosts and all

Oops
It's the only world event that doesn't scale to ship and crew size. It's totally doable solo, but more fun with at least one crew mate.
    i believe (feel free to correct me, this is baszd on limited experience) that it scales in term of firepower: sloops will hardly get hit, while galleons better sail properly if they don't want 10 holes in a handful of seconds.

also for some reason they have sniper accueacy against cannon rowboats
        It really depends on placement and rotation of the ghost ships tbh. I had Gally encounters where we hardly had to move, but also some that were incredibly difficult. A Gally is also a bigger target and therefore gets hit more often than a sloop (those damn fireballs are so annoying on a Gally).

Best tip for solo: Stay outside of the ships circles and you will have an easier time.
    This ^ . I solo sloop the world event but not being able to shoot and maintain your angles at the same time makes it take a LOT longer, especially with the captains that will take at least two, if not three, passes for you to down solo.  You can stay stationary and get them in one pass, but make sure you don’t get pinched by two captains n friends going opposite directions. You’ll sink fast.
Also do the oos voyage not the world event. Oos voyage is 2 waves and once you know what's happening can be done really quick. 15 minutes tops
    Did they change that with the update? It used to be the same as world events.
        Did it? I thought the regular oos ghost fleet was always 2 waves but i could be wrong. Haven't played one since the update but did 3 in one session before season 11 and each was 2 waves.
            Unless my mind is hopelessly fried 😂

I did a couple before it returned as an event, so it's a while ago. Could be I totally mix it up... it's one of them days 😝
Ghost ships take 3 shots (unless they just pop out of a portal on you, then just 1 shot) no matter the crew size. However, even if the rate at which they fire, and the quantity of the ghost ships doesn’t change, just the fact that you can turn your sloop faster than a gally makes it easier to get angle faster, and therefore allows you to knock out more ghost ships in a shorter amount of time.
    >Ghost ships take 3 shots (unless they just pop out of a portal on you, then just 1 shot

Its just randomly either 1 or 3 shots. I've had plenty insta die after being active for ages.
Fyi, if you are high enough athena lvl to do the raid voyage of a skeleton fort, do those. You'll find 2 ghost captain skulls in them. That's faster then doing 2 ghost voyages.

No idea when the rework of the loot comes for raid voyages so this might change in the near future.
Ghost fleet, unlike other world events, scales based on crew size via accuracy alone, meaning a solo is much less likely to take on severe flak than say a brigantine would. It won’t save you from sailing bow first into the broadside of an entire formation, but may make it a bit less deadly to compensate for a smaller crew.
It should scale to crew or ship size i forgot which but that might just be the world event version not sure about the voyage
It does not scale, they always go down randomly in either one or three hits. Both variants of the event are quite easy as a solo slooper.
