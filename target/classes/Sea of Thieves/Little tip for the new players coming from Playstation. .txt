[[Little tip for the new players coming from Playstation. ]]


Just in case you want to fight newbies like yourself and not tryhard veterans who wants to bully you.


Jokes on the PS5 players I’m shit even with keyboard and mouse lol
    Same. I'm very much a pve person but i love sot and playing with my friends who can carry my potato butt.
        Permanent helmsman reporting for duty
            Remember maities! Cannons sink ships but repairs win battles!
            I mean I'm our fisher person, cannon person, occasional helmsman, and repair person. Mostly fishing though. As I'm currently in safer seas farming my battlegills for commendations......
        I feel this.
    Keeps them clear of hackers though
        I mean TBH I know I suck but I don’t think there are that many hackers just free roaming in adventure/high seas mode, seems like they mostly focus on hourglass.

But either way, next update will have Easy Anti Cheat enabled instead of Rare’s janky in house anti cheat so I’m hopeful that the majority of what few hackers there are will be banished
            Easy anti cheat EAC is a bit of a joke there's loads of ways around it just look at games like Rust still tons of hackers
                The only thing that saves Rust is it's community servers with active admins if you go on Facepunch servers  where unless there's a dev playing there's no admins everyone and their dog has some sort of aimbot or esp if Rares taking the cheap option and getting EAC the cheater problem isn't gonna stop.
    I’m generally terrible at pvp in general…
    I’m so excited to have a player base that is just as unskilled at pvp as I am, however short-lived that will be 😂🤣
    Atleast you have those im stuck with the controller
What have you done, now the xbox sweats are gonna invade the PS5 only servers YOU HAVE DOOMED US ALL
    xbox sweats?

        Yeah, some in the younger generations use an Xbox controller better than a mouse. Their lives have been touch screens and joysticks. I am so old I had to often take the track ball out of my mouse to clean gunk off the rollers. ... I exclusively play on my Asus Rog ally now and am absolutely terrible at the game. It's fun using the gyro for aiming tho. I recommend not leveling up your company commendations as quickly as you're able to unless you're ready for more challenge from PvE as well as PvP. I don't know for sure if it's true, but when I have leveled up commendations more than one level at a time; I found the PvP to also get more difficult.
            Leveling up trading companies doesn’t increase difficulty in any way. It’s the same game whether you’re brand new or PL. there’s just new quests available and cosmetic rewards available at higher levels. It does nothing to difficulty whatsoever.
                It used to.  Season 11 'fixed' that.  But before, getting trade company promotions meant they offer harder, more lucrative voyages and you couldn't get access to the easy ones unless a new player was on your crew and bought them.
                    It increases difficulty of the quests themselves sure. But that was not his concern. He thought that increasing your level made the game match make you with people of higher skill/level which is not the case.
                        In fairness, I did preface that statement with the words "I don't know for sure". Meaning, I didn't know... for sure. I am being told that I am incorrect, which I accept.
                            No hate! It’s a common thing nowadays so it’s better to assume it does than to be surprised by it. One of the many reasons I love the game is the insane range of people you can meet and the interactions you can have due to the lack of a matchmaking system. I have a fond memory of holding a newer player “hostage” (we never planned on sinking him just wanted to troll him a bit). We told him that we would let him go if he sang the Barbie theme song for us. And he agreed! It was awful but I expect nothing less. He gave him some of the loot we had on us and sent him on his way, definitely my favorite friendly encounter
                                For sure, all good.
                    No it didn’t. You have higher level quests available but even at that the games difficulty didn’t change. You just have the OPTION to buy and play more worthwhile quests.
                        What?  You do an X-marks-the-spot Gold Hoarder voyage with a new pirate on the old system and you kill the skeletons that spawn in 2 hits.  Once you started them at Gold Hoarder 50 they moved faster, hit harder and took several hits to kill.  And you couldn't buy the lower level voyages once you take a promotion.
                            Skelleys take 3 hits unless you power hit them. It’s never changed. If it looked like 2 for you you were experiencing lag or playing a different game. You have 0 clue how the game actually works or ever worked. Have you even played it?
                                Since day 1.  Skeleton health varied with your trade company reputation from day 1 right up until the voyage overhaul.  Were you there?  Did you play through Athena Voyages before they had seasons?
                                    I’ve been playing since before release. Yes. I’ve been there and you’re wrong.
                                I can safely say, as someone who makes new accounts and new pirates very often, that before season 11 skeletons in voyages took 2 hits to kill in lower level voyages.
                                    Okay buddy 👍 go ahead and believe your own bullshit. The rest of the world will go ahead with reality.
                                    It's well documented all over the internet as well.  Varying health based on voyage.  It's even in some of phuzzybond's older videos.  But that redditor you're replying to has invested too many insults to admit he's wrong.
            I feel directly attacked. Although I didn't grow up on touchscreens, I just had a console because I was poor.....

Fuck you I'm still cracked!
                I'm sorry to hear that you're cracked. Try and rub some burts beeswax on affected areas. 
I want to get good at using joysticks, like you, but it just isn't in the cards.
                    Burt’s?! Oh nooooo. The hits keep coming
                    Lmao this guy has humor. I love it😂
            First of all, idk why you have to attack me like that with words like “so old” and “track ball.” I’m still processing that’s considered outdated. I would cry, but we weren’t allowed to do that before chores were done. What happened? Why is time so fast?
            I forget which game it was, I think it was one of the first cross play CoD games, but after a few months of release, it came out that Xbox players were murder stomping PS players overall lmao
                PUBG was like that for a while, but the PS version came out like a year later then the Xbox version
            [deleted]
                Did you miss the Fortnite comp where the controller player shat on mkb players?
                    Now have em turn off all aim assists and try it again.
                        You don't need aim assist to box someone like a fish homie
            >Yeah, some in the younger generations use an Xbox controller better than a mouse. 

Okay, so they're bad at aiming with two different control layouts... ?
                Are you saying that you can't be good at aiming with a controller?
                    I'm saying you can't be as good at aiming with a controller as you can be with a mouse. The best mouse player with always ridicule the best controller player. If you're unsure about that, remember console esports use aim assist.
                        What about that excludes one group from just not being good at the game? Some people weight train professionally, that doesn't make the buff guy at the gym unable to bench press 200 pounds. You're confusing two different things.
                            No no, they're surely decent at the game. They're just not great.
                        What do you mean when you say "always ridicule them"? I think you don't understand what that means regardless I think your getting theyll always be better than the controller player. Which couldn't be more wrong game sense and brain is more important than accuracy. By far. So yea a controller player can easily be better than an all aim no brain mouse user. Just depends on the person
                            Thank you for your worthless input. Indeed, when you don't take accuracy into account, mouse/controller is suddenly not very important.
                        "The best mouse player will always ridicule the best controller player" ridicule me as im dunking you with my controller and taking your loot. Any game. No problem Mr.AimBrain
            I got a message from a kid the other day on sea of thieves asking if I was 30 cause I play like an old man
                Are you? I would have taken that as a compliment because I play like I am 40+.
                    I mean technically I'm older than 30 but I didn't realize since the Atari that I had strayed into the old man territory just yet lol
            >. I am so old I had to often take the track ball out of my mouse to clean gunk off the rollers

I still do this 

Though obviously now they're laser mice and this just breaks them.

I get through a lot of mice.
                Improving performance and breaking something can be a fine line sometimes. I hear you.
            It doesn’t matter how fast you level up emissaries. You can still keep doing them over and over again till you don’t want to doesn’t increase diffculty
            best sot players are all pc players
            Your Rog runs SoT? I'm struggling to get mine to. Did you do anything to help it?
                Yes, it runs very well. Before the previous big update it ran at almost 30fps on performance mode. Now I have to run it on turbo and I get 35fps steady on battery and 40 plugged in. Try and lower your resolution from 1080
            “Younger generation” 

I’m sure people if your generation are goated on a controller too, sounds like a skill issue
                Pshaw, what part of my comment made you think I was lacking skill at this game? Was it when I said that I was terrible at this game? Great apprehension Perry Mason. 

Kidding aside, skills at gaming and athletics depreciate as we get older. Quick twitch and reaction decrease quicker than we want. Plus, starting families and focus on work translates to a lot less time for gaming. However: the really cool thing is, you get to come home to a family that loves you and you get to spend the money you earn on vacations and doing other really fun stuff. 

To be a goat at your level at a video game would mean playing more than 2-6 hours a week. Unfortunately, that's all people in their mid 40's can manage. 

Enjoy it while you can and I hope you are super successful and start a great family in the future.
        I have a turtle beach recon gaming controller. Sea of thieves go so much easier with 2 more buttons on the back of my controller. Now I can easily double gun with the pistol and eor👍
    Alright, buuuut consider this: if a number of sea of thieves veterans spawn in default ships during ps5 launch day - we have a golden opportunity to spread Pirate Traumatic Stress Disorder (commonly known as PTSD) accross the seas at a rate never before seen!

Whenever a default ship is sighted, it's either A) someone on their very first voyage, or B) a sweatlord just waiting for you to mistake him for an easy kill. We all have the power to make each encounter option B) 😈.... it will be funni to flatten some poor unsuspecting griefers and sloop chasers.

(For the record, this operation shall be known as "Plan B")
        What I'm hearing is that if I want to mess with gank happy folks, I should log in to a default sloop on launch day.
            EXACTLY
    Shit, I call that play “private game” so the ps players can learn the game before getting into the craziness of pvp lol.
    Well I planned on that to show you all the ropes, not slaughter you all.
Im gonna hunt for newbies to take under my wing. The more people learn to love this game the better.
    Me to ,,I want to hunt for newbies,,you know to help them and stuff,.
        By making their boats lighter
    that’s how i feel too. give em a month or two and they’ll be fresh targets
    …. I don’t believe You. I want to… but I don’t.
    I call dibs to be under your wing when it comes out
    That is the true way to play this game. Teach em kids, help them get some loot, and at the end, after selling everything, invite them to a naval fight to the death so they get some friendly practice as a farewell :) 
I'll just play safer seas to start me off, as I'm planning on doing all tale tails accommodations
    Now you can activate the tall tales from your ship.
        Can you? I haven't played since I had xbox tbh, I'm worried I'll play them in the wrong order, tbh but I'll be fine lol
            They made it to where you can activate tall tales from your quest table. All of the tall tales are in order from first to last. 
How long since you played last?
                Wait that’s crazy. Maybe I’ll go back to the grind
            Let me rephrase, you can activate any tall tale and you can dive and emerge at the island that you need to start it.
                Ah, ok, no problem, thanks for letting me know
            And that is the exact reason why a recent change where they made it so you can play them in any order was dumb.
            > I'm worried I'll play them in the wrong order

Nah they're laid out chronologically in the menu for you now, and while you can play the different series in any order (it doesn't actually affect you much) you do have to play through each chapter within a series to unlock the next.
    Completing all tall tale commendations is a **bit** more than something to start off with

(I’m talking days of work)
        Yeah, I'll probably do the ones that have the cooler cosmetics and do complete the ones whenever I have free time
            Heart of fire is probably the best tall tale to complete. Relatively short and gives two of the best free cosmetics (ashen hull and ashen curse)
                Thank you
    Smart
As a soon to be PlayStation player... No. I will learn this game through trial by fire.
    Based?
    "Death can have me... When it earns me" 🔥🤣
    For what its worth, cross-play servers usually offer a wide range of skill and you are even more likely to find other new players on them compared to controller-only servers

    The mean messages I got the other night after dropping gunpowder barrels 2 pirates left in the crows nest down onto their ship says otherwise
        [deleted]
            It was a poorly worded joke. I found a crew that had gunpowder barrels in their crows nest. I dropped them, sunk their ship, and received some very angry messages shortly after about how I’m ruining the game. Ruining a pirate game, by being a fucking pirate. These kids are just soft.

                                    What has been proven wrong lol? That your enviroment doesn't affect you while you're growing up? That's just blatantly false on every possible metric. There's not even a concrete way of testing nature vs. nurture because you can't isolate variables that are always interacting and present. As a parent you control their access to the internet just as you'd control their access to certain people. No good parent believes that kids should have unbridled internet access.
                                    ![gif](giphy|tQQN3jaGnJdDljVTAZ|downsized)
                            Your personality and identity are molded by your experiences AND your nature. Anyone claiming its only one way or the other are full of it. You can't even really separate the two to even begin to figure out which is which on an individual scale.
    Targeting new players *because* they’re new and easy targets is still shitty though

            They need a minecraft mode where anyone can pop in and destroy another players realm and just laugh at them and scream "pirate game!!!!
                You mean other than factions servers?
        IDK it's funny as hell to listen to their crying
    You can play however you like, but sinking players just because you want to even when it doesn't benefit you in the slightest still makes you an a-hole.
        And who decides if it benefits me or not? You or me? It has benefitted me 100% of the time I've sunk other players.

            SoT is PvPvE.

If new players are attacking you and yelling slurs then show no mercy.
But steamrolling new players who don't want to fight and have no loot gives you no PvP benefits. They don't learn anything from getting steamrolled and you don't get any better because you just steamrolled a bunch of noobs.
                [deleted]
                    Just admit you want to powertrip on sinking newer players who won’t know how to fight back and move on

    I’m like 100% positive that the option to pick controller or KBM, or any crossplay options don’t work on Sea of Thieves.
    You being offended doesn't mean you are right.
    I’m sure there will be a specific cross-play setting implemented before the PS5 launch. Sony does not let developers have their games force us to play on other platforms, it has to be an option we can toggle.

EDIT: I’m not condoning this, I am just stating what PlayStation allows the developers to do. I don’t know why I am getting downvoted for it lol. Go downvote Sony
        [deleted]
            I know there is no setting for it now, but that’s because there never needed to be. There isn’t a single game on PlayStation that forces you to play with players on other platforms. 

I do hope they keep the option for controller only there too though. I’d personally like to play with both consoles, just not the mouse and keyboard players.
                It may try to match with ps users,,,,but it won't most of the time,,,it will be a preference setting probably.
        IDK man. I remember PS5 players whining about forced cross play in Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
            It’s a toggle option in Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but the wait times without it are so unbearable that it makes it unreasonable not to have cross-play on. I think that’s what they must’ve been whining about.
                It was forced crossplay at launch. The subreddit was full of PS5 players crying about it. 

I stopped playing TCM when Gun prevented PC players from playing with consoles. I don't know what's happened with the game since then. If it's an option now, that came after launch.
                    I think that may have been a bug because there are articles from launch week describing how to enable/disable cross-play. Or at the very least an oversight they were forced to correct. 

Why did they stop PC players from playing with consoles? That’s a game I don’t see mouse and keyboard having much of an advantage on. 

I read that Gun is passing over the development to another studio to keep the live service going. Weird how short they worked on it directly after launch.
                        > Why did they stop PC players from playing with consoles? 

It released without an anti-cheat and it didn't take long for people to start using cheats. About a month after launch, Gun took PC out of the cross play mix. Current gen consoles still played together. PS4 and Xbox One were never cross play. 

The combination of so many Dead by Daylight players (not the most toxic gaming community, but its toxic enough that i want no part of it) and whining PS5 players afraid of games outside of their walled garden took away a lot of the enjoyment I had in the game and interacting with other players outside of the game (such as the subreddit). We complain about this subreddit but compared with the TCM subreddit, this place is downright cordial and professional.

>That’s a game I don’t see mouse and keyboard having much of an advantage on.

I'd say mouse and keyboard were a disadvantage in that game. It's a whole lot easier to kite killers when you can turn your thumbstick in a full circle than it is for a killer to turn their whole forearm in a full circle to match the movement with a mouse.
                            Cheaters are the worst. Gotta ruin it for the rest of us. 

DBD is a toxic ( and thirsty ) community for sure lol. It’s a shame TCM was plagued by these things.. I’m worried Killer Klowns from Outer Space will end up in the same boat. 

I love the SoT subreddit, even if it can sometimes be aggressive. Makes sense for pirates at least.
    There’s nothing wrong with fighting in a PvP game. Chasing and gunning down anything with a sail like a rabid Chihuahua, then server-hopping to do the same thing again would suggest otherwise.

        What is this the sea of grammar
As a new player on xbox .. it's kinda fun getting in a fight with people that are way better.. I'm a few weeks in and a fairly competent solo slooper because of it.  Those boys and girls that have been playing for years may sink you.. but it will also show you how effective some strategies can be.
    Solo slooping is the best practice you can get.
        I disagree. 

Whats better for practice, a 2 minute fight when youre 1v3 against a brig, or a 20 minute fight 2v3 against a brig? Sure doesnt seem youd get much good practice in solo when you either get destroyed quickly by any competent crew, or you have to evade and run. Remember, Im not talking about *you*, Im talking about for a **new player**

Learning to work with a crew is better practice, and you benefit from actually learning from other players, and having fights last longer.  Solo youre limited in what you can accomplish, so you dont experience everything. Youre less likely to take a fight since youre solo and likely almost always at a disadvantage. So, I dont really think I can understand why someone would think its objectively better practice. Is it because you think you 'dont do everything' when youre with a crew so you dont learn how to do stuff?

Do people really think that when youre with a crew, you have rigid roles and no one ever does anything outside of that role? Because thats really not how most crews work. If Im playing with a crew, I still do everything. I still learn everything. 

Solo slooping is hard mode, sure you learn well because its a trial by fire. But having someone help you learn is infinitely better, and Im always interested why people who *only* solo sloop actually think its the best way to learn for any new player. It might work for you, but that doesnt mean its *best*.

 This is coming from a Day 1 player who has played countless hours solo.
            Its crazy that people are downvoting this, im also a day 1 player with countless hours solo and i could not agree with you more. Solo is definitely the worst way to learn the game. Its too hard to get decent practice in when all it takes is 1 unlucky cannonball to the face and your practice is over.
                Ya its just the crowd, there are a ton of solo sloopers who are really active on this site and will swear up and down its the best way to play the game, the best way to learn the game, etc. They think that if you play with a crew, you dont learn to do everything. Which is wild to me. Kinda tells me theyve just never really played with a crew.

And I believe they intrepet me saying that 'playing with a crew is the best way to learn' as Im saying they were somehow 'wrong' by learning that way.  Which isnt what I meant.
            Just gotta go against the wind as a solo slooper lol
            Some of us just take a good knock in the head to learn.
                And that can only happen when you're solo?
                    Not at all... I think both ways of playing can teach alot.. solo just worked better for me.
    The real thieves are the pirates we make along the way ❤️
Won't learn much from sinking swabbies. You'll never get better if you don't challenge yourself
Also: *Closed Crew*
I’m friendly as long as you’re friendly, so if you get into a server with XBOX players (and it’s one of the few times I’m on), you might find a friendly Master Chief… if you’re lucky enough.
bunch of noobs playing with each other ain’t gonna teach the code m8y
Just a reminder that getting killed in a game with PvP is never bullying.
    And you should also always have the skull with an eyepatch flag on 24/7. It’s called the “Flag of the reapers mark” and gives you a x2 level and gold bonus.
    It’s fucking hilarious that if someone is better at video games it’s only because “they want to bully me”. It’s such a pathetic mindset and backwards from where we were 5-10 years ago. 

People used to acknowledge that if you wanted to not be trash you have to practice. Now people expect the game to coddle them
As a pc player who came from Xbox, I find WAY MORE peaceful players on pc, dads cross playing with their kids or wives. A lot of new people on pc who just need help. Xbox was a constant stream of screeching 12 year olds spam killing
Xbox only servers are way more aggressive for me, I prefer crossplay you find more friendly and casual players in crossplay. Maybe it's just an EU thing but yeah, they're all sweaty and bloodthirsty.
    I find that in a lot of games even on eu servers. The common enemy seems to be the french aswell lmao and idk why
    > Xbox only servers are way more aggressive for me, I prefer crossplay you find more friendly and casual players in crossplay.

Really? I find the opposite on NA servers. Most other ships on Xbox servers just do their own thing.
Also put your fucking legs in the crows nest
    Kegs
        But also legs, i have spotted sneaky pirates in the crows nest a few times because of their legs. They use an emote to stay low but their legs stick out the side of the crows nest.
Nah, let them get trounced by PC players for a bit, it'll make for some delicious salt harvesting
I tend to encounter way more try hard players on Xbox only severs.
PlayStation players should be X-Play only. COD forces Xbox to be X-Play while PS users can hide away on their own servers  Xbox should take a stand here and give them similar treatment. I say this as an Xbox player who still on plays on crossplay servers, it would honestly help balance the skill levels.
No! let them suffer like we all did!
Ez HG lvl up
Fresh blood
Will the playstation players play in an only-playstation server? Or will they be able to play with all other platforms?
    I watched the update today and saw no mention of that, just that it would have crossplay.

So I assume it will be just like on xbox. You can select 'prefer to sail with controller players' but you cant just opt out of crossplay entirely. So idk what this post is talking about or why no one is pointing this out...
If they opt out of cross play there's still all the Xbox console vets out there. But yeah, probably less brutal at least.
    To my knowledge they haven't said how opting out of crossplay will work, have they? I hope this is how it works and there is "mixed" servers and "console only" servers, but it very well could work so that opting out of crossplay puts them in "Playstation only" servers like we now have "Xbox only" servers. This is how most games do it ...which is dumb, because people opting out of crossplay are trying to avoid m/kb and hackers, not other console players.
So from my understanding, you can select to **prefer** to play against people with controllers, or no preference. Doesnt seem like turning off crossplay entirely, but the game just tries to put you into controller only lobbies if possible. 

Am I mistaken? I dont think PS5 players can turn off crossplay with Xbox players, can they?
    > the game just tries to put you into controller only lobbies if possible.

Have thousands of hours in the game and I've never been put in a crossplay Adventure lobby when I had selected controller only. As long as you are in a populated region or the game doesn't die off all of a sudden in the near future, this is a non-issue in my experience. If you select controller only, you get controller only.

> Am I mistaken? I dont think PS5 players can turn off crossplay with Xbox players, can they?

We don't know yet. At least I haven't heard any announcements on how it will work. Hopefully opting Xbox/Playstation players opting out of crossplay are put together. That will be the best thing for the player population; dividing the playerbase into three would not be good long term, especially for hourglass.
        Well I just noticed that the option *specifically* says "prefers" when selecting between controller lobbies or not. I dont think theres any world where that choice of words was a mistake or an oversight.

I would be willing to bet that people on playstation will simply have the same option people on xbox have for selecting controller lobbies. It would make no sense to give them an option to only play with playstation servers, considering as you said how splitting that playerbase wouldnt make sense.

So I really dont know why people are just assuming that they will be able to do that, and essentially just spreading misinformation. We dont know yet, but we have a precedent thats been set with xbox/pc crossplay and no indication it will be different.
            > I dont think theres any world where that choice of words was a mistake or an oversight.

Yes, it says it's a "preference" in the same way the medication you take says a possible side effect is death. Very unlikely to happen, but technically possible. And I specified as long as you are in a *populated region*. If you're playing in Australia (a lower populated region) at 4AM, yeah, you might not get your preference. But if you're NA for example, it's a non-issue no matter when you play. At least in 2024. 5 years from now if the game's playerbase has died off, things could change.

> It would make no sense to give them an option to only play with playstation servers, considering as you said how splitting that playerbase wouldnt make sense.


You're right, it would make no sense. But despite this, game after game does their crossplay opt out this way (separating by platform rather than just pulling console/controller players away from PC/mouse and keyboard). I don't know why because all it does is make the game unplayable if you opt out of crossplay since servers will be dead. I wonder if it's for privacy or legal reasons or something so they technically give you the option to play on a closed platform? It could also be something that Sony advocates for since they were against allowing crossplay in the first place. I don't know, I just know most games do it the "wrong way," but I'm hoping SoT does it right.
                > Yes, it says it's a "preference" in the same way the medication you take says a possible side effect is death.

What a terrible, absolutely random, comparison. 

>But despite this, game after game does their crossplay opt out this way

Do they? Many games also dont do that. So you seem to be just randomly saying things at this point.

Were not talking about other games and what they do, but what SoT is doing. And we are certainly not talking about medications.
                    > What a terrible, absolutely random, comparison.

What are you talking about? It's an analogy and a perfectly fitting one. It's just a disclaimer man. Lots of things you do in life have disclaimers just so the company covers their ass. There is nothing random about it in the context of our conversation. Google "analogy" if you're still confused.

> Do they? Many games also dont do that. So you seem to be just randomly saying things at this point. Were not talking about other games and what they do, but what SoT is doing. And we are certainly not talking about medications.

Well, you're wrong. Please list the "many" games that have "console only" crossplay opt out where Xbox/PS/Nintendo can play together without PC. The list is exceedingly small (off the top of my head I can only think of Apex and Destiny 2). Most games if you opt out, you are with your platform only.

Me saying this is not random in the slightest. If we're trying to predict what will happen with SoT, we can look to past examples to see what happened with other games. And looking at past evidence, *the vast majority of games* don't give a "console only" option like we're talking about here (and if they do, it's only for a "ranked" mode which SoT does not have). I hope SoT is different than that trend, but you saying we shouldn't look at current trends to predict what will happen in this case is a very bizarre take.

There are some factors that make SoT different which is why I'm hoping Rare does the sensible thing here. Namely that the game is going cross platform many years after launch and it's Microsoft rather than a 3rd party studio. So I'm hoping for the best, but we cannot say one way or the other right now.
Is there anyway I’ll be able to link my Xbox account to my PlayStation account? I’ve been playing the game since year one and no longer have an Xbox but don’t want to restart on PlayStation
I'm just looking forward to getting back to the game. I played on PC previously, but my laptop is starting to show its age, and Sea of Thieves now just tanks the framerate until its like trying to play a slideshow. I loved playing SoT as my go-to relaxation game, where I would sail aimlessly around the map while listening to podcasts.
The skill curve is pretty sharp, you either know the mechanics or you don’t lol so yeah fighting veterans is impossible
Quick tip: put gunpowder barrels on your ship, they sell for alot and are very fun to use on your friends
about to get WIPED
Just remember if you don’t have about 1500 don’t even bother joining the discord because you won’t be able to find a group oh and you probably need a PVP curse
We might not even be able to differentiate platforms in game
Is our first ship at least better than the driftwood Skull and Bones gave new players?
Bro i'm just gonna play on safer seas till i'm ready to fight back
I'm just glad there will be others who need to grind hour glass
learning experience imo there's always someone better
Little tip for those that think crossplay matchmaking is able to be toggled. It's not. Read the settings it tells you!!!!!! It is A PREFERENCE NOT GUARANTEED
Doesn't matter PC players will just have their client crash while standing on an island.
Don't worry, I've been playing sot with my laptop/ps controller long enough to not be completely useless! (I'm so glad I don't have to suffer through that anymore)
I just want my progress from PC to be transferable to PlayStation
    As far as I know it will be. I play on xbox, and will jump to ps because of it. As long as you have played on a microsoft account, youre good! Use that account to sign in on the ps version
The majority of the newer players will be on crossplay servers, because they don’t know about the setting. Telling more people about that setting is an honorable attempt at saving them some heartache for sure but in reality, you’re feeding them to the wolves.
bro you need to add eye patch to be a real game

0/10
Now OP, you think you're doing these PS5 boys a favor taking them aside every time PC players come down on them, protecting them from big bad scary PVP. You're cutting their legs from under them.

The world don't give a damn about how sensitive these kids are, especially the young PS5 kids. You ain't doin' these kids a favor by putting them in those lower waters. You patronizing them; You crippling them; You crippling them for life.
    Exactly. Its called Sea of Thieves, not Sea of Friends XD
Follow up tip:don’t put fun powder barrels in your crows nest. It’ll be easily shot at and take down your mast. Put it down below or at the very front of your ship.
Well don't tell them.
Can you keep quiet? I will finally sink some ships
As an Xbox player… my time has finally come to be considered the sweat on a server…

May the reaper flag being me bountiful loot hauls.
Proud steam deck User ready to stomp fortnite kids daring to play sot.
All the "salty veterans" left. You PvE lot are just bullying each other at this point, blaming the PvP side.
If you don’t make it clear to me your a PS player, you will suffer my wrath
Barely such thing as an Xbox sweat but Ight.
But what if i just want to explore? And not do any PvP at all?
    Choose Safe Seas then...
        Oh, i thought we would still meet others!

PvP isn't my thing, might consider it bu waaaayyyy after i explore everything. Not a competitive guy.
            Sadly the sea of thieves community love the “it’s sea of THIEVES” argument. And love pvp a bit too much, even when you have nothing.
Thanks for clarifying. I wasn't sure it is was all in my head of not.

It’s not a disable, it’s only a preference. You will be paired with the PC players
    No, that's not how it works in practice. I know "technically" it's a preference in the settings, but as long as you are in a populated region, you will be put in the preference you choose.
        If you play HG you will be out with PC players all the time. You can easily tell by how fast they move. 

As even with your sensitivity maxed on Xbox you turn like an old boat. 

Love getting down voted for being completely correct as well.
            I assume people downvoted you because you are wrong. No, if you select Xbox only (again, as long as you’re in a populated region), you will not get put with PC players. And no, you definitely did not get matched with PC players in hourglass from an Xbox only server. The game is not even capable of doing that. You can sit under water for an hour waiting and you’ll never get put with PC.

Controller at max sensitivity is still not as good as a mouse, but it is pretty fast. Definitely not like an “old boat.” Have you played controller on 10 sensitivity? Alternatively, it’s possible you were up against cheaters using XIM to use mouse and keyboard on controller only servers. Very common in the console “tdm” community.
People in the comments clearly butthurt about being called "bullies" for spawn-camping a solo slooper with no loot on board while spamming slurs in the chat, and then hunting them down to do it again after they scuttle.

(That's called bullying, btw)
Actually, that's genius and I think it a great thing for PS5 players to do. I play on PC, and the odds of fighting aren't SUPER high. But I have found the vast majority of people either hard avoid me or shoot immediately. I don't think I've had a single peaceful encounter in the month of playing outside of people running at the sight of me.
I’m a player who went from Xbone to PS5. Had to say good bye to SOT. But now we’re so back baby!!!
Same. I'm very much a pve person but i love sot and playing with my friends who can carry my potato butt.
    Permanent helmsman reporting for duty
        Remember maities! Cannons sink ships but repairs win battles!
        I mean I'm our fisher person, cannon person, occasional helmsman, and repair person. Mostly fishing though. As I'm currently in safer seas farming my battlegills for commendations......
    I feel this.
Keeps them clear of hackers though
    I mean TBH I know I suck but I don’t think there are that many hackers just free roaming in adventure/high seas mode, seems like they mostly focus on hourglass.

But either way, next update will have Easy Anti Cheat enabled instead of Rare’s janky in house anti cheat so I’m hopeful that the majority of what few hackers there are will be banished
        Easy anti cheat EAC is a bit of a joke there's loads of ways around it just look at games like Rust still tons of hackers
            The only thing that saves Rust is it's community servers with active admins if you go on Facepunch servers  where unless there's a dev playing there's no admins everyone and their dog has some sort of aimbot or esp if Rares taking the cheap option and getting EAC the cheater problem isn't gonna stop.
I’m generally terrible at pvp in general…
I’m so excited to have a player base that is just as unskilled at pvp as I am, however short-lived that will be 😂🤣
Atleast you have those im stuck with the controller
xbox sweats?

    Yeah, some in the younger generations use an Xbox controller better than a mouse. Their lives have been touch screens and joysticks. I am so old I had to often take the track ball out of my mouse to clean gunk off the rollers. ... I exclusively play on my Asus Rog ally now and am absolutely terrible at the game. It's fun using the gyro for aiming tho. I recommend not leveling up your company commendations as quickly as you're able to unless you're ready for more challenge from PvE as well as PvP. I don't know for sure if it's true, but when I have leveled up commendations more than one level at a time; I found the PvP to also get more difficult.
        Leveling up trading companies doesn’t increase difficulty in any way. It’s the same game whether you’re brand new or PL. there’s just new quests available and cosmetic rewards available at higher levels. It does nothing to difficulty whatsoever.
            It used to.  Season 11 'fixed' that.  But before, getting trade company promotions meant they offer harder, more lucrative voyages and you couldn't get access to the easy ones unless a new player was on your crew and bought them.
                It increases difficulty of the quests themselves sure. But that was not his concern. He thought that increasing your level made the game match make you with people of higher skill/level which is not the case.
                    In fairness, I did preface that statement with the words "I don't know for sure". Meaning, I didn't know... for sure. I am being told that I am incorrect, which I accept.
                        No hate! It’s a common thing nowadays so it’s better to assume it does than to be surprised by it. One of the many reasons I love the game is the insane range of people you can meet and the interactions you can have due to the lack of a matchmaking system. I have a fond memory of holding a newer player “hostage” (we never planned on sinking him just wanted to troll him a bit). We told him that we would let him go if he sang the Barbie theme song for us. And he agreed! It was awful but I expect nothing less. He gave him some of the loot we had on us and sent him on his way, definitely my favorite friendly encounter
                            For sure, all good.
                No it didn’t. You have higher level quests available but even at that the games difficulty didn’t change. You just have the OPTION to buy and play more worthwhile quests.
                    What?  You do an X-marks-the-spot Gold Hoarder voyage with a new pirate on the old system and you kill the skeletons that spawn in 2 hits.  Once you started them at Gold Hoarder 50 they moved faster, hit harder and took several hits to kill.  And you couldn't buy the lower level voyages once you take a promotion.
                        Skelleys take 3 hits unless you power hit them. It’s never changed. If it looked like 2 for you you were experiencing lag or playing a different game. You have 0 clue how the game actually works or ever worked. Have you even played it?
                            Since day 1.  Skeleton health varied with your trade company reputation from day 1 right up until the voyage overhaul.  Were you there?  Did you play through Athena Voyages before they had seasons?
                                I’ve been playing since before release. Yes. I’ve been there and you’re wrong.
                            I can safely say, as someone who makes new accounts and new pirates very often, that before season 11 skeletons in voyages took 2 hits to kill in lower level voyages.
                                Okay buddy 👍 go ahead and believe your own bullshit. The rest of the world will go ahead with reality.
                                It's well documented all over the internet as well.  Varying health based on voyage.  It's even in some of phuzzybond's older videos.  But that redditor you're replying to has invested too many insults to admit he's wrong.
        I feel directly attacked. Although I didn't grow up on touchscreens, I just had a console because I was poor.....

Fuck you I'm still cracked!
            I'm sorry to hear that you're cracked. Try and rub some burts beeswax on affected areas. 
I want to get good at using joysticks, like you, but it just isn't in the cards.
                Burt’s?! Oh nooooo. The hits keep coming
                Lmao this guy has humor. I love it😂
        First of all, idk why you have to attack me like that with words like “so old” and “track ball.” I’m still processing that’s considered outdated. I would cry, but we weren’t allowed to do that before chores were done. What happened? Why is time so fast?
        I forget which game it was, I think it was one of the first cross play CoD games, but after a few months of release, it came out that Xbox players were murder stomping PS players overall lmao
            PUBG was like that for a while, but the PS version came out like a year later then the Xbox version

            Did you miss the Fortnite comp where the controller player shat on mkb players?
                Now have em turn off all aim assists and try it again.
                    You don't need aim assist to box someone like a fish homie
        >Yeah, some in the younger generations use an Xbox controller better than a mouse. 

Okay, so they're bad at aiming with two different control layouts... ?
            Are you saying that you can't be good at aiming with a controller?
                I'm saying you can't be as good at aiming with a controller as you can be with a mouse. The best mouse player with always ridicule the best controller player. If you're unsure about that, remember console esports use aim assist.
                    What about that excludes one group from just not being good at the game? Some people weight train professionally, that doesn't make the buff guy at the gym unable to bench press 200 pounds. You're confusing two different things.
                        No no, they're surely decent at the game. They're just not great.
                    What do you mean when you say "always ridicule them"? I think you don't understand what that means regardless I think your getting theyll always be better than the controller player. Which couldn't be more wrong game sense and brain is more important than accuracy. By far. So yea a controller player can easily be better than an all aim no brain mouse user. Just depends on the person
                        Thank you for your worthless input. Indeed, when you don't take accuracy into account, mouse/controller is suddenly not very important.
                    "The best mouse player will always ridicule the best controller player" ridicule me as im dunking you with my controller and taking your loot. Any game. No problem Mr.AimBrain
        I got a message from a kid the other day on sea of thieves asking if I was 30 cause I play like an old man
            Are you? I would have taken that as a compliment because I play like I am 40+.
                I mean technically I'm older than 30 but I didn't realize since the Atari that I had strayed into the old man territory just yet lol
        >. I am so old I had to often take the track ball out of my mouse to clean gunk off the rollers

I still do this 

Though obviously now they're laser mice and this just breaks them.

I get through a lot of mice.
            Improving performance and breaking something can be a fine line sometimes. I hear you.
        It doesn’t matter how fast you level up emissaries. You can still keep doing them over and over again till you don’t want to doesn’t increase diffculty
        best sot players are all pc players
        Your Rog runs SoT? I'm struggling to get mine to. Did you do anything to help it?
            Yes, it runs very well. Before the previous big update it ran at almost 30fps on performance mode. Now I have to run it on turbo and I get 35fps steady on battery and 40 plugged in. Try and lower your resolution from 1080
        “Younger generation” 

I’m sure people if your generation are goated on a controller too, sounds like a skill issue
            Pshaw, what part of my comment made you think I was lacking skill at this game? Was it when I said that I was terrible at this game? Great apprehension Perry Mason. 

Kidding aside, skills at gaming and athletics depreciate as we get older. Quick twitch and reaction decrease quicker than we want. Plus, starting families and focus on work translates to a lot less time for gaming. However: the really cool thing is, you get to come home to a family that loves you and you get to spend the money you earn on vacations and doing other really fun stuff. 

To be a goat at your level at a video game would mean playing more than 2-6 hours a week. Unfortunately, that's all people in their mid 40's can manage. 

Enjoy it while you can and I hope you are super successful and start a great family in the future.
    I have a turtle beach recon gaming controller. Sea of thieves go so much easier with 2 more buttons on the back of my controller. Now I can easily double gun with the pistol and eor👍
Alright, buuuut consider this: if a number of sea of thieves veterans spawn in default ships during ps5 launch day - we have a golden opportunity to spread Pirate Traumatic Stress Disorder (commonly known as PTSD) accross the seas at a rate never before seen!

Whenever a default ship is sighted, it's either A) someone on their very first voyage, or B) a sweatlord just waiting for you to mistake him for an easy kill. We all have the power to make each encounter option B) 😈.... it will be funni to flatten some poor unsuspecting griefers and sloop chasers.

(For the record, this operation shall be known as "Plan B")
    What I'm hearing is that if I want to mess with gank happy folks, I should log in to a default sloop on launch day.
        EXACTLY
Shit, I call that play “private game” so the ps players can learn the game before getting into the craziness of pvp lol.
Well I planned on that to show you all the ropes, not slaughter you all.

that’s how i feel too. give em a month or two and they’ll be fresh targets

I call dibs to be under your wing when it comes out
That is the true way to play this game. Teach em kids, help them get some loot, and at the end, after selling everything, invite them to a naval fight to the death so they get some friendly practice as a farewell :) 
Now you can activate the tall tales from your ship.
    Can you? I haven't played since I had xbox tbh, I'm worried I'll play them in the wrong order, tbh but I'll be fine lol
        They made it to where you can activate tall tales from your quest table. All of the tall tales are in order from first to last. 
How long since you played last?
            Wait that’s crazy. Maybe I’ll go back to the grind
        Let me rephrase, you can activate any tall tale and you can dive and emerge at the island that you need to start it.
            Ah, ok, no problem, thanks for letting me know
        And that is the exact reason why a recent change where they made it so you can play them in any order was dumb.
        > I'm worried I'll play them in the wrong order

Nah they're laid out chronologically in the menu for you now, and while you can play the different series in any order (it doesn't actually affect you much) you do have to play through each chapter within a series to unlock the next.
Completing all tall tale commendations is a **bit** more than something to start off with

(I’m talking days of work)
    Yeah, I'll probably do the ones that have the cooler cosmetics and do complete the ones whenever I have free time
        Heart of fire is probably the best tall tale to complete. Relatively short and gives two of the best free cosmetics (ashen hull and ashen curse)
            Thank you

For what its worth, cross-play servers usually offer a wide range of skill and you are even more likely to find other new players on them compared to controller-only servers

        It was a poorly worded joke. I found a crew that had gunpowder barrels in their crows nest. I dropped them, sunk their ship, and received some very angry messages shortly after about how I’m ruining the game. Ruining a pirate game, by being a fucking pirate. These kids are just soft.

There's not even a concrete way of testing nature vs. nurture because you can't isolate variables that are always interacting and present. As a parent you control their access to the internet just as you'd control their access to certain people. No good parent believes that kids should have unbridled internet access.

                        Your personality and identity are molded by your experiences AND your nature. Anyone claiming its only one way or the other are full of it. You can't even really separate the two to even begin to figure out which is which on an individual scale.

You can play however you like, but sinking players just because you want to even when it doesn't benefit you in the slightest still makes you an a-hole.
    And who decides if it benefits me or not? You or me? It has benefitted me 100% of the time I've sunk other players.

But steamrolling new players who don't want to fight and have no loot gives you no PvP benefits. They don't learn anything from getting steamrolled and you don't get any better because you just steamrolled a bunch of noobs.

I’m like 100% positive that the option to pick controller or KBM, or any crossplay options don’t work on Sea of Thieves.
You being offended doesn't mean you are right.
I’m sure there will be a specific cross-play setting implemented before the PS5 launch. Sony does not let developers have their games force us to play on other platforms, it has to be an option we can toggle.

EDIT: I’m not condoning this, I am just stating what PlayStation allows the developers to do. I don’t know why I am getting downvoted for it lol. Go downvote Sony
    [deleted]
        I know there is no setting for it now, but that’s because there never needed to be. There isn’t a single game on PlayStation that forces you to play with players on other platforms. 

I do hope they keep the option for controller only there too though. I’d personally like to play with both consoles, just not the mouse and keyboard players.
            It may try to match with ps users,,,,but it won't most of the time,,,it will be a preference setting probably.
    IDK man. I remember PS5 players whining about forced cross play in Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
        It’s a toggle option in Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but the wait times without it are so unbearable that it makes it unreasonable not to have cross-play on. I think that’s what they must’ve been whining about.
            It was forced crossplay at launch. The subreddit was full of PS5 players crying about it. 

I stopped playing TCM when Gun prevented PC players from playing with consoles. I don't know what's happened with the game since then. If it's an option now, that came after launch.
                I think that may have been a bug because there are articles from launch week describing how to enable/disable cross-play. Or at the very least an oversight they were forced to correct. 

Why did they stop PC players from playing with consoles? That’s a game I don’t see mouse and keyboard having much of an advantage on. 

I read that Gun is passing over the development to another studio to keep the live service going. Weird how short they worked on it directly after launch.
                    > Why did they stop PC players from playing with consoles? 

It released without an anti-cheat and it didn't take long for people to start using cheats. About a month after launch, Gun took PC out of the cross play mix. Current gen consoles still played together. PS4 and Xbox One were never cross play. 

The combination of so many Dead by Daylight players (not the most toxic gaming community, but its toxic enough that i want no part of it) and whining PS5 players afraid of games outside of their walled garden took away a lot of the enjoyment I had in the game and interacting with other players outside of the game (such as the subreddit). We complain about this subreddit but compared with the TCM subreddit, this place is downright cordial and professional.

>That’s a game I don’t see mouse and keyboard having much of an advantage on.

I'd say mouse and keyboard were a disadvantage in that game. It's a whole lot easier to kite killers when you can turn your thumbstick in a full circle than it is for a killer to turn their whole forearm in a full circle to match the movement with a mouse.
                        Cheaters are the worst. Gotta ruin it for the rest of us. 

DBD is a toxic ( and thirsty ) community for sure lol. It’s a shame TCM was plagued by these things.. I’m worried Killer Klowns from Outer Space will end up in the same boat. 

I love the SoT subreddit, even if it can sometimes be aggressive. Makes sense for pirates at least.
There’s nothing wrong with fighting in a PvP game. Chasing and gunning down anything with a sail like a rabid Chihuahua, then server-hopping to do the same thing again would suggest otherwise.

    What is this the sea of grammar
Solo slooping is the best practice you can get.
    I disagree. 

Whats better for practice, a 2 minute fight when youre 1v3 against a brig, or a 20 minute fight 2v3 against a brig? Sure doesnt seem youd get much good practice in solo when you either get destroyed quickly by any competent crew, or you have to evade and run. Remember, Im not talking about *you*, Im talking about for a **new player**

Learning to work with a crew is better practice, and you benefit from actually learning from other players, and having fights last longer.  Solo youre limited in what you can accomplish, so you dont experience everything. Youre less likely to take a fight since youre solo and likely almost always at a disadvantage. So, I dont really think I can understand why someone would think its objectively better practice. Is it because you think you 'dont do everything' when youre with a crew so you dont learn how to do stuff?

Do people really think that when youre with a crew, you have rigid roles and no one ever does anything outside of that role? Because thats really not how most crews work. If Im playing with a crew, I still do everything. I still learn everything. 

Solo slooping is hard mode, sure you learn well because its a trial by fire. But having someone help you learn is infinitely better, and Im always interested why people who *only* solo sloop actually think its the best way to learn for any new player. It might work for you, but that doesnt mean its *best*.

 This is coming from a Day 1 player who has played countless hours solo.
        Its crazy that people are downvoting this, im also a day 1 player with countless hours solo and i could not agree with you more. Solo is definitely the worst way to learn the game. Its too hard to get decent practice in when all it takes is 1 unlucky cannonball to the face and your practice is over.
            Ya its just the crowd, there are a ton of solo sloopers who are really active on this site and will swear up and down its the best way to play the game, the best way to learn the game, etc. They think that if you play with a crew, you dont learn to do everything. Which is wild to me. Kinda tells me theyve just never really played with a crew.

And I believe they intrepet me saying that 'playing with a crew is the best way to learn' as Im saying they were somehow 'wrong' by learning that way.  Which isnt what I meant.
        Just gotta go against the wind as a solo slooper lol
        Some of us just take a good knock in the head to learn.
            And that can only happen when you're solo?
                Not at all... I think both ways of playing can teach alot.. solo just worked better for me.
The real thieves are the pirates we make along the way ❤️
And you should also always have the skull with an eyepatch flag on 24/7. It’s called the “Flag of the reapers mark” and gives you a x2 level and gold bonus.
It’s fucking hilarious that if someone is better at video games it’s only because “they want to bully me”. It’s such a pathetic mindset and backwards from where we were 5-10 years ago. 

People used to acknowledge that if you wanted to not be trash you have to practice. Now people expect the game to coddle them
I find that in a lot of games even on eu servers. The common enemy seems to be the french aswell lmao and idk why
> Xbox only servers are way more aggressive for me, I prefer crossplay you find more friendly and casual players in crossplay.

Really? I find the opposite on NA servers. Most other ships on Xbox servers just do their own thing.
Kegs
    But also legs, i have spotted sneaky pirates in the crows nest a few times because of their legs. They use an emote to stay low but their legs stick out the side of the crows nest.
I watched the update today and saw no mention of that, just that it would have crossplay.

So I assume it will be just like on xbox. You can select 'prefer to sail with controller players' but you cant just opt out of crossplay entirely. So idk what this post is talking about or why no one is pointing this out...
To my knowledge they haven't said how opting out of crossplay will work, have they? I hope this is how it works and there is "mixed" servers and "console only" servers, but it very well could work so that opting out of crossplay puts them in "Playstation only" servers like we now have "Xbox only" servers. This is how most games do it ...which is dumb, because people opting out of crossplay are trying to avoid m/kb and hackers, not other console players.
> the game just tries to put you into controller only lobbies if possible.

Have thousands of hours in the game and I've never been put in a crossplay Adventure lobby when I had selected controller only. As long as you are in a populated region or the game doesn't die off all of a sudden in the near future, this is a non-issue in my experience. If you select controller only, you get controller only.

> Am I mistaken? I dont think PS5 players can turn off crossplay with Xbox players, can they?

We don't know yet. At least I haven't heard any announcements on how it will work. Hopefully opting Xbox/Playstation players opting out of crossplay are put together. That will be the best thing for the player population; dividing the playerbase into three would not be good long term, especially for hourglass.
    Well I just noticed that the option *specifically* says "prefers" when selecting between controller lobbies or not. I dont think theres any world where that choice of words was a mistake or an oversight.

I would be willing to bet that people on playstation will simply have the same option people on xbox have for selecting controller lobbies. It would make no sense to give them an option to only play with playstation servers, considering as you said how splitting that playerbase wouldnt make sense.

So I really dont know why people are just assuming that they will be able to do that, and essentially just spreading misinformation. We dont know yet, but we have a precedent thats been set with xbox/pc crossplay and no indication it will be different.
        > I dont think theres any world where that choice of words was a mistake or an oversight.

Yes, it says it's a "preference" in the same way the medication you take says a possible side effect is death. Very unlikely to happen, but technically possible. And I specified as long as you are in a *populated region*. If you're playing in Australia (a lower populated region) at 4AM, yeah, you might not get your preference. But if you're NA for example, it's a non-issue no matter when you play. At least in 2024. 5 years from now if the game's playerbase has died off, things could change.

> It would make no sense to give them an option to only play with playstation servers, considering as you said how splitting that playerbase wouldnt make sense.


You're right, it would make no sense. But despite this, game after game does their crossplay opt out this way (separating by platform rather than just pulling console/controller players away from PC/mouse and keyboard). I don't know why because all it does is make the game unplayable if you opt out of crossplay since servers will be dead. I wonder if it's for privacy or legal reasons or something so they technically give you the option to play on a closed platform? It could also be something that Sony advocates for since they were against allowing crossplay in the first place. I don't know, I just know most games do it the "wrong way," but I'm hoping SoT does it right.
            > Yes, it says it's a "preference" in the same way the medication you take says a possible side effect is death.

What a terrible, absolutely random, comparison. 

>But despite this, game after game does their crossplay opt out this way

Do they? Many games also dont do that. So you seem to be just randomly saying things at this point.

Were not talking about other games and what they do, but what SoT is doing. And we are certainly not talking about medications.
                > What a terrible, absolutely random, comparison.

What are you talking about? It's an analogy and a perfectly fitting one. It's just a disclaimer man. Lots of things you do in life have disclaimers just so the company covers their ass. There is nothing random about it in the context of our conversation. Google "analogy" if you're still confused.

> Do they? Many games also dont do that. So you seem to be just randomly saying things at this point. Were not talking about other games and what they do, but what SoT is doing. And we are certainly not talking about medications.

Well, you're wrong. Please list the "many" games that have "console only" crossplay opt out where Xbox/PS/Nintendo can play together without PC. The list is exceedingly small (off the top of my head I can only think of Apex and Destiny 2). Most games if you opt out, you are with your platform only.

Me saying this is not random in the slightest. If we're trying to predict what will happen with SoT, we can look to past examples to see what happened with other games. And looking at past evidence, *the vast majority of games* don't give a "console only" option like we're talking about here (and if they do, it's only for a "ranked" mode which SoT does not have). I hope SoT is different than that trend, but you saying we shouldn't look at current trends to predict what will happen in this case is a very bizarre take.

There are some factors that make SoT different which is why I'm hoping Rare does the sensible thing here. Namely that the game is going cross platform many years after launch and it's Microsoft rather than a 3rd party studio. So I'm hoping for the best, but we cannot say one way or the other right now.
As far as I know it will be. I play on xbox, and will jump to ps because of it. As long as you have played on a microsoft account, youre good! Use that account to sign in on the ps version
Exactly. Its called Sea of Thieves, not Sea of Friends XD
Choose Safe Seas then...
    Oh, i thought we would still meet others!

PvP isn't my thing, might consider it bu waaaayyyy after i explore everything. Not a competitive guy.
        Sadly the sea of thieves community love the “it’s sea of THIEVES” argument. And love pvp a bit too much, even when you have nothing.
No, that's not how it works in practice. I know "technically" it's a preference in the settings, but as long as you are in a populated region, you will be put in the preference you choose.
    If you play HG you will be out with PC players all the time. You can easily tell by how fast they move. 

As even with your sensitivity maxed on Xbox you turn like an old boat. 

Love getting down voted for being completely correct as well.
        I assume people downvoted you because you are wrong. No, if you select Xbox only (again, as long as you’re in a populated region), you will not get put with PC players. And no, you definitely did not get matched with PC players in hourglass from an Xbox only server. The game is not even capable of doing that. You can sit under water for an hour waiting and you’ll never get put with PC.

Controller at max sensitivity is still not as good as a mouse, but it is pretty fast. Definitely not like an “old boat.” Have you played controller on 10 sensitivity? Alternatively, it’s possible you were up against cheaters using XIM to use mouse and keyboard on controller only servers. Very common in the console “tdm” community.

    I mean I'm our fisher person, cannon person, occasional helmsman, and repair person. Mostly fishing though. As I'm currently in safer seas farming my battlegills for commendations......
I feel this.
I mean TBH I know I suck but I don’t think there are that many hackers just free roaming in adventure/high seas mode, seems like they mostly focus on hourglass.

But either way, next update will have Easy Anti Cheat enabled instead of Rare’s janky in house anti cheat so I’m hopeful that the majority of what few hackers there are will be banished
    Easy anti cheat EAC is a bit of a joke there's loads of ways around it just look at games like Rust still tons of hackers
        The only thing that saves Rust is it's community servers with active admins if you go on Facepunch servers  where unless there's a dev playing there's no admins everyone and their dog has some sort of aimbot or esp if Rares taking the cheap option and getting EAC the cheater problem isn't gonna stop.

Yeah, some in the younger generations use an Xbox controller better than a mouse. Their lives have been touch screens and joysticks. I am so old I had to often take the track ball out of my mouse to clean gunk off the rollers. ... I exclusively play on my Asus Rog ally now and am absolutely terrible at the game. It's fun using the gyro for aiming tho. I recommend not leveling up your company commendations as quickly as you're able to unless you're ready for more challenge from PvE as well as PvP. I don't know for sure if it's true, but when I have leveled up commendations more than one level at a time; I found the PvP to also get more difficult.
    Leveling up trading companies doesn’t increase difficulty in any way. It’s the same game whether you’re brand new or PL. there’s just new quests available and cosmetic rewards available at higher levels. It does nothing to difficulty whatsoever.
        It used to.  Season 11 'fixed' that.  But before, getting trade company promotions meant they offer harder, more lucrative voyages and you couldn't get access to the easy ones unless a new player was on your crew and bought them.
            It increases difficulty of the quests themselves sure. But that was not his concern. He thought that increasing your level made the game match make you with people of higher skill/level which is not the case.
                In fairness, I did preface that statement with the words "I don't know for sure". Meaning, I didn't know... for sure. I am being told that I am incorrect, which I accept.
                    No hate! It’s a common thing nowadays so it’s better to assume it does than to be surprised by it. One of the many reasons I love the game is the insane range of people you can meet and the interactions you can have due to the lack of a matchmaking system. I have a fond memory of holding a newer player “hostage” (we never planned on sinking him just wanted to troll him a bit). We told him that we would let him go if he sang the Barbie theme song for us. And he agreed! It was awful but I expect nothing less. He gave him some of the loot we had on us and sent him on his way, definitely my favorite friendly encounter
                        For sure, all good.
            No it didn’t. You have higher level quests available but even at that the games difficulty didn’t change. You just have the OPTION to buy and play more worthwhile quests.
                What?  You do an X-marks-the-spot Gold Hoarder voyage with a new pirate on the old system and you kill the skeletons that spawn in 2 hits.  Once you started them at Gold Hoarder 50 they moved faster, hit harder and took several hits to kill.  And you couldn't buy the lower level voyages once you take a promotion.
                    Skelleys take 3 hits unless you power hit them. It’s never changed. If it looked like 2 for you you were experiencing lag or playing a different game. You have 0 clue how the game actually works or ever worked. Have you even played it?
                        Since day 1.  Skeleton health varied with your trade company reputation from day 1 right up until the voyage overhaul.  Were you there?  Did you play through Athena Voyages before they had seasons?
                            I’ve been playing since before release. Yes. I’ve been there and you’re wrong.
                        I can safely say, as someone who makes new accounts and new pirates very often, that before season 11 skeletons in voyages took 2 hits to kill in lower level voyages.
                            Okay buddy 👍 go ahead and believe your own bullshit. The rest of the world will go ahead with reality.
                            It's well documented all over the internet as well.  Varying health based on voyage.  It's even in some of phuzzybond's older videos.  But that redditor you're replying to has invested too many insults to admit he's wrong.
    I feel directly attacked. Although I didn't grow up on touchscreens, I just had a console because I was poor.....

Fuck you I'm still cracked!
        I'm sorry to hear that you're cracked. Try and rub some burts beeswax on affected areas. 
I want to get good at using joysticks, like you, but it just isn't in the cards.
            Burt’s?! Oh nooooo. The hits keep coming
            Lmao this guy has humor. I love it😂
    First of all, idk why you have to attack me like that with words like “so old” and “track ball.” I’m still processing that’s considered outdated. I would cry, but we weren’t allowed to do that before chores were done. What happened? Why is time so fast?
    I forget which game it was, I think it was one of the first cross play CoD games, but after a few months of release, it came out that Xbox players were murder stomping PS players overall lmao
        PUBG was like that for a while, but the PS version came out like a year later then the Xbox version

    >Yeah, some in the younger generations use an Xbox controller better than a mouse. 

Okay, so they're bad at aiming with two different control layouts... ?
        Are you saying that you can't be good at aiming with a controller?
            I'm saying you can't be as good at aiming with a controller as you can be with a mouse. The best mouse player with always ridicule the best controller player. If you're unsure about that, remember console esports use aim assist.
                What about that excludes one group from just not being good at the game? Some people weight train professionally, that doesn't make the buff guy at the gym unable to bench press 200 pounds. You're confusing two different things.
                    No no, they're surely decent at the game. They're just not great.
                What do you mean when you say "always ridicule them"? I think you don't understand what that means regardless I think your getting theyll always be better than the controller player. Which couldn't be more wrong game sense and brain is more important than accuracy. By far. So yea a controller player can easily be better than an all aim no brain mouse user. Just depends on the person
                    Thank you for your worthless input. Indeed, when you don't take accuracy into account, mouse/controller is suddenly not very important.
                "The best mouse player will always ridicule the best controller player" ridicule me as im dunking you with my controller and taking your loot. Any game. No problem Mr.AimBrain
    I got a message from a kid the other day on sea of thieves asking if I was 30 cause I play like an old man
        Are you? I would have taken that as a compliment because I play like I am 40+.
            I mean technically I'm older than 30 but I didn't realize since the Atari that I had strayed into the old man territory just yet lol
    >. I am so old I had to often take the track ball out of my mouse to clean gunk off the rollers

I still do this 

Though obviously now they're laser mice and this just breaks them.

I get through a lot of mice.
        Improving performance and breaking something can be a fine line sometimes. I hear you.

        Yes, it runs very well. Before the previous big update it ran at almost 30fps on performance mode. Now I have to run it on turbo and I get 35fps steady on battery and 40 plugged in. Try and lower your resolution from 1080
    “Younger generation” 

I’m sure people if your generation are goated on a controller too, sounds like a skill issue
        Pshaw, what part of my comment made you think I was lacking skill at this game? Was it when I said that I was terrible at this game? Great apprehension Perry Mason. 

Kidding aside, skills at gaming and athletics depreciate as we get older. Quick twitch and reaction decrease quicker than we want. Plus, starting families and focus on work translates to a lot less time for gaming. However: the really cool thing is, you get to come home to a family that loves you and you get to spend the money you earn on vacations and doing other really fun stuff. 

To be a goat at your level at a video game would mean playing more than 2-6 hours a week. Unfortunately, that's all people in their mid 40's can manage. 

Enjoy it while you can and I hope you are super successful and start a great family in the future.

    They made it to where you can activate tall tales from your quest table. All of the tall tales are in order from first to last. 
How long since you played last?
        Wait that’s crazy. Maybe I’ll go back to the grind
    Let me rephrase, you can activate any tall tale and you can dive and emerge at the island that you need to start it.
        Ah, ok, no problem, thanks for letting me know
    And that is the exact reason why a recent change where they made it so you can play them in any order was dumb.
    > I'm worried I'll play them in the wrong order

Nah they're laid out chronologically in the menu for you now, and while you can play the different series in any order (it doesn't actually affect you much) you do have to play through each chapter within a series to unlock the next.
Yeah, I'll probably do the ones that have the cooler cosmetics and do complete the ones whenever I have free time
    Heart of fire is probably the best tall tale to complete. Relatively short and gives two of the best free cosmetics (ashen hull and ashen curse)

    It was a poorly worded joke. I found a crew that had gunpowder barrels in their crows nest. I dropped them, sunk their ship, and received some very angry messages shortly after about how I’m ruining the game. Ruining a pirate game, by being a fucking pirate. These kids are just soft.

If new players are attacking you and yelling slurs then show no mercy.
But steamrolling new players who don't want to fight and have no loot gives you no PvP benefits. They don't learn anything from getting steamrolled and you don't get any better because you just steamrolled a bunch of noobs.

    I know there is no setting for it now, but that’s because there never needed to be. There isn’t a single game on PlayStation that forces you to play with players on other platforms. 

I do hope they keep the option for controller only there too though. I’d personally like to play with both consoles, just not the mouse and keyboard players.
        It may try to match with ps users,,,,but it won't most of the time,,,it will be a preference setting probably.
IDK man. I remember PS5 players whining about forced cross play in Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
    It’s a toggle option in Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but the wait times without it are so unbearable that it makes it unreasonable not to have cross-play on. I think that’s what they must’ve been whining about.
        It was forced crossplay at launch. The subreddit was full of PS5 players crying about it. 

I stopped playing TCM when Gun prevented PC players from playing with consoles. I don't know what's happened with the game since then. If it's an option now, that came after launch.
            I think that may have been a bug because there are articles from launch week describing how to enable/disable cross-play. Or at the very least an oversight they were forced to correct. 

Why did they stop PC players from playing with consoles? That’s a game I don’t see mouse and keyboard having much of an advantage on. 

I read that Gun is passing over the development to another studio to keep the live service going. Weird how short they worked on it directly after launch.
                > Why did they stop PC players from playing with consoles? 

It released without an anti-cheat and it didn't take long for people to start using cheats. About a month after launch, Gun took PC out of the cross play mix. Current gen consoles still played together. PS4 and Xbox One were never cross play. 

The combination of so many Dead by Daylight players (not the most toxic gaming community, but its toxic enough that i want no part of it) and whining PS5 players afraid of games outside of their walled garden took away a lot of the enjoyment I had in the game and interacting with other players outside of the game (such as the subreddit). We complain about this subreddit but compared with the TCM subreddit, this place is downright cordial and professional.

>That’s a game I don’t see mouse and keyboard having much of an advantage on.

I'd say mouse and keyboard were a disadvantage in that game. It's a whole lot easier to kite killers when you can turn your thumbstick in a full circle than it is for a killer to turn their whole forearm in a full circle to match the movement with a mouse.
                    Cheaters are the worst. Gotta ruin it for the rest of us. 

DBD is a toxic ( and thirsty ) community for sure lol. It’s a shame TCM was plagued by these things.. I’m worried Killer Klowns from Outer Space will end up in the same boat. 

I love the SoT subreddit, even if it can sometimes be aggressive. Makes sense for pirates at least.
I already got my 300, normally I give out if ppl ask
    Can I have 180 mister? 😢
What is this the sea of grammar
I disagree. 

Whats better for practice, a 2 minute fight when youre 1v3 against a brig, or a 20 minute fight 2v3 against a brig? Sure doesnt seem youd get much good practice in solo when you either get destroyed quickly by any competent crew, or you have to evade and run. Remember, Im not talking about *you*, Im talking about for a **new player**

Learning to work with a crew is better practice, and you benefit from actually learning from other players, and having fights last longer.  Solo youre limited in what you can accomplish, so you dont experience everything. Youre less likely to take a fight since youre solo and likely almost always at a disadvantage. So, I dont really think I can understand why someone would think its objectively better practice. Is it because you think you 'dont do everything' when youre with a crew so you dont learn how to do stuff?

Do people really think that when youre with a crew, you have rigid roles and no one ever does anything outside of that role? Because thats really not how most crews work. If Im playing with a crew, I still do everything. I still learn everything. 

Solo slooping is hard mode, sure you learn well because its a trial by fire. But having someone help you learn is infinitely better, and Im always interested why people who *only* solo sloop actually think its the best way to learn for any new player. It might work for you, but that doesnt mean its *best*.

 This is coming from a Day 1 player who has played countless hours solo.
    Its crazy that people are downvoting this, im also a day 1 player with countless hours solo and i could not agree with you more. Solo is definitely the worst way to learn the game. Its too hard to get decent practice in when all it takes is 1 unlucky cannonball to the face and your practice is over.
        Ya its just the crowd, there are a ton of solo sloopers who are really active on this site and will swear up and down its the best way to play the game, the best way to learn the game, etc. They think that if you play with a crew, you dont learn to do everything. Which is wild to me. Kinda tells me theyve just never really played with a crew.

And I believe they intrepet me saying that 'playing with a crew is the best way to learn' as Im saying they were somehow 'wrong' by learning that way.  Which isnt what I meant.
    Just gotta go against the wind as a solo slooper lol
    Some of us just take a good knock in the head to learn.
        And that can only happen when you're solo?
            Not at all... I think both ways of playing can teach alot.. solo just worked better for me.
But also legs, i have spotted sneaky pirates in the crows nest a few times because of their legs. They use an emote to stay low but their legs stick out the side of the crows nest.
Well I just noticed that the option *specifically* says "prefers" when selecting between controller lobbies or not. I dont think theres any world where that choice of words was a mistake or an oversight.

I would be willing to bet that people on playstation will simply have the same option people on xbox have for selecting controller lobbies. It would make no sense to give them an option to only play with playstation servers, considering as you said how splitting that playerbase wouldnt make sense.

So I really dont know why people are just assuming that they will be able to do that, and essentially just spreading misinformation. We dont know yet, but we have a precedent thats been set with xbox/pc crossplay and no indication it will be different.
    > I dont think theres any world where that choice of words was a mistake or an oversight.

Yes, it says it's a "preference" in the same way the medication you take says a possible side effect is death. Very unlikely to happen, but technically possible. And I specified as long as you are in a *populated region*. If you're playing in Australia (a lower populated region) at 4AM, yeah, you might not get your preference. But if you're NA for example, it's a non-issue no matter when you play. At least in 2024. 5 years from now if the game's playerbase has died off, things could change.

> It would make no sense to give them an option to only play with playstation servers, considering as you said how splitting that playerbase wouldnt make sense.


You're right, it would make no sense. But despite this, game after game does their crossplay opt out this way (separating by platform rather than just pulling console/controller players away from PC/mouse and keyboard). I don't know why because all it does is make the game unplayable if you opt out of crossplay since servers will be dead. I wonder if it's for privacy or legal reasons or something so they technically give you the option to play on a closed platform? It could also be something that Sony advocates for since they were against allowing crossplay in the first place. I don't know, I just know most games do it the "wrong way," but I'm hoping SoT does it right.
        > Yes, it says it's a "preference" in the same way the medication you take says a possible side effect is death.

What a terrible, absolutely random, comparison. 

>But despite this, game after game does their crossplay opt out this way

Do they? Many games also dont do that. So you seem to be just randomly saying things at this point.

Were not talking about other games and what they do, but what SoT is doing. And we are certainly not talking about medications.
            > What a terrible, absolutely random, comparison.

What are you talking about? It's an analogy and a perfectly fitting one. It's just a disclaimer man. Lots of things you do in life have disclaimers just so the company covers their ass. There is nothing random about it in the context of our conversation. Google "analogy" if you're still confused.

> Do they? Many games also dont do that. So you seem to be just randomly saying things at this point. Were not talking about other games and what they do, but what SoT is doing. And we are certainly not talking about medications.

Well, you're wrong. Please list the "many" games that have "console only" crossplay opt out where Xbox/PS/Nintendo can play together without PC. The list is exceedingly small (off the top of my head I can only think of Apex and Destiny 2). Most games if you opt out, you are with your platform only.

Me saying this is not random in the slightest. If we're trying to predict what will happen with SoT, we can look to past examples to see what happened with other games. And looking at past evidence, *the vast majority of games* don't give a "console only" option like we're talking about here (and if they do, it's only for a "ranked" mode which SoT does not have). I hope SoT is different than that trend, but you saying we shouldn't look at current trends to predict what will happen in this case is a very bizarre take.

There are some factors that make SoT different which is why I'm hoping Rare does the sensible thing here. Namely that the game is going cross platform many years after launch and it's Microsoft rather than a 3rd party studio. So I'm hoping for the best, but we cannot say one way or the other right now.
Oh, i thought we would still meet others!

PvP isn't my thing, might consider it bu waaaayyyy after i explore everything. Not a competitive guy.
    Sadly the sea of thieves community love the “it’s sea of THIEVES” argument. And love pvp a bit too much, even when you have nothing.
If you play HG you will be out with PC players all the time. You can easily tell by how fast they move. 

As even with your sensitivity maxed on Xbox you turn like an old boat. 

Love getting down voted for being completely correct as well.
    I assume people downvoted you because you are wrong. No, if you select Xbox only (again, as long as you’re in a populated region), you will not get put with PC players. And no, you definitely did not get matched with PC players in hourglass from an Xbox only server. The game is not even capable of doing that. You can sit under water for an hour waiting and you’ll never get put with PC.

Controller at max sensitivity is still not as good as a mouse, but it is pretty fast. Definitely not like an “old boat.” Have you played controller on 10 sensitivity? Alternatively, it’s possible you were up against cheaters using XIM to use mouse and keyboard on controller only servers. Very common in the console “tdm” community.
Remember maities! Cannons sink ships but repairs win battles!
I mean I'm our fisher person, cannon person, occasional helmsman, and repair person. Mostly fishing though. As I'm currently in safer seas farming my battlegills for commendations......
Easy anti cheat EAC is a bit of a joke there's loads of ways around it just look at games like Rust still tons of hackers
    The only thing that saves Rust is it's community servers with active admins if you go on Facepunch servers  where unless there's a dev playing there's no admins everyone and their dog has some sort of aimbot or esp if Rares taking the cheap option and getting EAC the cheater problem isn't gonna stop.

Leveling up trading companies doesn’t increase difficulty in any way. It’s the same game whether you’re brand new or PL. there’s just new quests available and cosmetic rewards available at higher levels. It does nothing to difficulty whatsoever.
    It used to.  Season 11 'fixed' that.  But before, getting trade company promotions meant they offer harder, more lucrative voyages and you couldn't get access to the easy ones unless a new player was on your crew and bought them.
        It increases difficulty of the quests themselves sure. But that was not his concern. He thought that increasing your level made the game match make you with people of higher skill/level which is not the case.
            In fairness, I did preface that statement with the words "I don't know for sure". Meaning, I didn't know... for sure. I am being told that I am incorrect, which I accept.
                No hate! It’s a common thing nowadays so it’s better to assume it does than to be surprised by it. One of the many reasons I love the game is the insane range of people you can meet and the interactions you can have due to the lack of a matchmaking system. I have a fond memory of holding a newer player “hostage” (we never planned on sinking him just wanted to troll him a bit). We told him that we would let him go if he sang the Barbie theme song for us. And he agreed! It was awful but I expect nothing less. He gave him some of the loot we had on us and sent him on his way, definitely my favorite friendly encounter
                    For sure, all good.
        No it didn’t. You have higher level quests available but even at that the games difficulty didn’t change. You just have the OPTION to buy and play more worthwhile quests.
            What?  You do an X-marks-the-spot Gold Hoarder voyage with a new pirate on the old system and you kill the skeletons that spawn in 2 hits.  Once you started them at Gold Hoarder 50 they moved faster, hit harder and took several hits to kill.  And you couldn't buy the lower level voyages once you take a promotion.
                Skelleys take 3 hits unless you power hit them. It’s never changed. If it looked like 2 for you you were experiencing lag or playing a different game. You have 0 clue how the game actually works or ever worked. Have you even played it?
                    Since day 1.  Skeleton health varied with your trade company reputation from day 1 right up until the voyage overhaul.  Were you there?  Did you play through Athena Voyages before they had seasons?
                        I’ve been playing since before release. Yes. I’ve been there and you’re wrong.
                    I can safely say, as someone who makes new accounts and new pirates very often, that before season 11 skeletons in voyages took 2 hits to kill in lower level voyages.
                        Okay buddy 👍 go ahead and believe your own bullshit. The rest of the world will go ahead with reality.
                        It's well documented all over the internet as well.  Varying health based on voyage.  It's even in some of phuzzybond's older videos.  But that redditor you're replying to has invested too many insults to admit he's wrong.
I feel directly attacked. Although I didn't grow up on touchscreens, I just had a console because I was poor.....

Fuck you I'm still cracked!
    I'm sorry to hear that you're cracked. Try and rub some burts beeswax on affected areas. 
I want to get good at using joysticks, like you, but it just isn't in the cards.
        Burt’s?! Oh nooooo. The hits keep coming
        Lmao this guy has humor. I love it😂
First of all, idk why you have to attack me like that with words like “so old” and “track ball.” I’m still processing that’s considered outdated. I would cry, but we weren’t allowed to do that before chores were done. What happened? Why is time so fast?
I forget which game it was, I think it was one of the first cross play CoD games, but after a few months of release, it came out that Xbox players were murder stomping PS players overall lmao
    PUBG was like that for a while, but the PS version came out like a year later then the Xbox version

    Did you miss the Fortnite comp where the controller player shat on mkb players?
        Now have em turn off all aim assists and try it again.
            You don't need aim assist to box someone like a fish homie
>Yeah, some in the younger generations use an Xbox controller better than a mouse. 

Okay, so they're bad at aiming with two different control layouts... ?
    Are you saying that you can't be good at aiming with a controller?
        I'm saying you can't be as good at aiming with a controller as you can be with a mouse. The best mouse player with always ridicule the best controller player. If you're unsure about that, remember console esports use aim assist.
            What about that excludes one group from just not being good at the game? Some people weight train professionally, that doesn't make the buff guy at the gym unable to bench press 200 pounds. You're confusing two different things.
                No no, they're surely decent at the game. They're just not great.
            What do you mean when you say "always ridicule them"? I think you don't understand what that means regardless I think your getting theyll always be better than the controller player. Which couldn't be more wrong game sense and brain is more important than accuracy. By far. So yea a controller player can easily be better than an all aim no brain mouse user. Just depends on the person
                Thank you for your worthless input. Indeed, when you don't take accuracy into account, mouse/controller is suddenly not very important.
            "The best mouse player will always ridicule the best controller player" ridicule me as im dunking you with my controller and taking your loot. Any game. No problem Mr.AimBrain
I got a message from a kid the other day on sea of thieves asking if I was 30 cause I play like an old man
    Are you? I would have taken that as a compliment because I play like I am 40+.
        I mean technically I'm older than 30 but I didn't realize since the Atari that I had strayed into the old man territory just yet lol
>. I am so old I had to often take the track ball out of my mouse to clean gunk off the rollers

I still do this 

Though obviously now they're laser mice and this just breaks them.

I get through a lot of mice.
    Improving performance and breaking something can be a fine line sometimes. I hear you.
It doesn’t matter how fast you level up emissaries. You can still keep doing them over and over again till you don’t want to doesn’t increase diffculty
best sot players are all pc players
Your Rog runs SoT? I'm struggling to get mine to. Did you do anything to help it?
    Yes, it runs very well. Before the previous big update it ran at almost 30fps on performance mode. Now I have to run it on turbo and I get 35fps steady on battery and 40 plugged in. Try and lower your resolution from 1080
“Younger generation” 

I’m sure people if your generation are goated on a controller too, sounds like a skill issue
    Pshaw, what part of my comment made you think I was lacking skill at this game? Was it when I said that I was terrible at this game? Great apprehension Perry Mason. 

Kidding aside, skills at gaming and athletics depreciate as we get older. Quick twitch and reaction decrease quicker than we want. Plus, starting families and focus on work translates to a lot less time for gaming. However: the really cool thing is, you get to come home to a family that loves you and you get to spend the money you earn on vacations and doing other really fun stuff. 

To be a goat at your level at a video game would mean playing more than 2-6 hours a week. Unfortunately, that's all people in their mid 40's can manage. 

Enjoy it while you can and I hope you are super successful and start a great family in the future.
EXACTLY
They made it to where you can activate tall tales from your quest table. All of the tall tales are in order from first to last. 
How long since you played last?
    Wait that’s crazy. Maybe I’ll go back to the grind
Let me rephrase, you can activate any tall tale and you can dive and emerge at the island that you need to start it.
    Ah, ok, no problem, thanks for letting me know
And that is the exact reason why a recent change where they made it so you can play them in any order was dumb.
> I'm worried I'll play them in the wrong order

Nah they're laid out chronologically in the menu for you now, and while you can play the different series in any order (it doesn't actually affect you much) you do have to play through each chapter within a series to unlock the next.
Heart of fire is probably the best tall tale to complete. Relatively short and gives two of the best free cosmetics (ashen hull and ashen curse)
    Thank you
It was a poorly worded joke. I found a crew that had gunpowder barrels in their crows nest. I dropped them, sunk their ship, and received some very angry messages shortly after about how I’m ruining the game. Ruining a pirate game, by being a fucking pirate. These kids are just soft.

As a parent you control their access to the internet just as you'd control their access to certain people. No good parent believes that kids should have unbridled internet access.

They need a minecraft mode where anyone can pop in and destroy another players realm and just laugh at them and scream "pirate game!!!!
    You mean other than factions servers?
SoT is PvPvE.

If new players are attacking you and yelling slurs then show no mercy.
But steamrolling new players who don't want to fight and have no loot gives you no PvP benefits. They don't learn anything from getting steamrolled and you don't get any better because you just steamrolled a bunch of noobs.

I assume people downvoted you because you are wrong. No, if you select Xbox only (again, as long as you’re in a populated region), you will not get put with PC players. And no, you definitely did not get matched with PC players in hourglass from an Xbox only server. The game is not even capable of doing that. You can sit under water for an hour waiting and you’ll never get put with PC.

Controller at max sensitivity is still not as good as a mouse, but it is pretty fast. Definitely not like an “old boat.” Have you played controller on 10 sensitivity? Alternatively, it’s possible you were up against cheaters using XIM to use mouse and keyboard on controller only servers. Very common in the console “tdm” community.
The only thing that saves Rust is it's community servers with active admins if you go on Facepunch servers  where unless there's a dev playing there's no admins everyone and their dog has some sort of aimbot or esp if Rares taking the cheap option and getting EAC the cheater problem isn't gonna stop.
It used to.  Season 11 'fixed' that.  But before, getting trade company promotions meant they offer harder, more lucrative voyages and you couldn't get access to the easy ones unless a new player was on your crew and bought them.
    It increases difficulty of the quests themselves sure. But that was not his concern. He thought that increasing your level made the game match make you with people of higher skill/level which is not the case.
        In fairness, I did preface that statement with the words "I don't know for sure". Meaning, I didn't know... for sure. I am being told that I am incorrect, which I accept.
            No hate! It’s a common thing nowadays so it’s better to assume it does than to be surprised by it. One of the many reasons I love the game is the insane range of people you can meet and the interactions you can have due to the lack of a matchmaking system. I have a fond memory of holding a newer player “hostage” (we never planned on sinking him just wanted to troll him a bit). We told him that we would let him go if he sang the Barbie theme song for us. And he agreed! It was awful but I expect nothing less. He gave him some of the loot we had on us and sent him on his way, definitely my favorite friendly encounter
                For sure, all good.
    No it didn’t. You have higher level quests available but even at that the games difficulty didn’t change. You just have the OPTION to buy and play more worthwhile quests.
        What?  You do an X-marks-the-spot Gold Hoarder voyage with a new pirate on the old system and you kill the skeletons that spawn in 2 hits.  Once you started them at Gold Hoarder 50 they moved faster, hit harder and took several hits to kill.  And you couldn't buy the lower level voyages once you take a promotion.
            Skelleys take 3 hits unless you power hit them. It’s never changed. If it looked like 2 for you you were experiencing lag or playing a different game. You have 0 clue how the game actually works or ever worked. Have you even played it?
                Since day 1.  Skeleton health varied with your trade company reputation from day 1 right up until the voyage overhaul.  Were you there?  Did you play through Athena Voyages before they had seasons?
                    I’ve been playing since before release. Yes. I’ve been there and you’re wrong.
                I can safely say, as someone who makes new accounts and new pirates very often, that before season 11 skeletons in voyages took 2 hits to kill in lower level voyages.
                    Okay buddy 👍 go ahead and believe your own bullshit. The rest of the world will go ahead with reality.
                    It's well documented all over the internet as well.  Varying health based on voyage.  It's even in some of phuzzybond's older videos.  But that redditor you're replying to has invested too many insults to admit he's wrong.
I'm sorry to hear that you're cracked. Try and rub some burts beeswax on affected areas. 
I want to get good at using joysticks, like you, but it just isn't in the cards.
    Burt’s?! Oh nooooo. The hits keep coming
    Lmao this guy has humor. I love it😂
PUBG was like that for a while, but the PS version came out like a year later then the Xbox version
Did you miss the Fortnite comp where the controller player shat on mkb players?
    Now have em turn off all aim assists and try it again.
        You don't need aim assist to box someone like a fish homie
Are you saying that you can't be good at aiming with a controller?
    I'm saying you can't be as good at aiming with a controller as you can be with a mouse. The best mouse player with always ridicule the best controller player. If you're unsure about that, remember console esports use aim assist.
        What about that excludes one group from just not being good at the game? Some people weight train professionally, that doesn't make the buff guy at the gym unable to bench press 200 pounds. You're confusing two different things.
            No no, they're surely decent at the game. They're just not great.
        What do you mean when you say "always ridicule them"? I think you don't understand what that means regardless I think your getting theyll always be better than the controller player. Which couldn't be more wrong game sense and brain is more important than accuracy. By far. So yea a controller player can easily be better than an all aim no brain mouse user. Just depends on the person
            Thank you for your worthless input. Indeed, when you don't take accuracy into account, mouse/controller is suddenly not very important.
        "The best mouse player will always ridicule the best controller player" ridicule me as im dunking you with my controller and taking your loot. Any game. No problem Mr.AimBrain
Are you? I would have taken that as a compliment because I play like I am 40+.
    I mean technically I'm older than 30 but I didn't realize since the Atari that I had strayed into the old man territory just yet lol
Improving performance and breaking something can be a fine line sometimes. I hear you.
Yes, it runs very well. Before the previous big update it ran at almost 30fps on performance mode. Now I have to run it on turbo and I get 35fps steady on battery and 40 plugged in. Try and lower your resolution from 1080
Pshaw, what part of my comment made you think I was lacking skill at this game? Was it when I said that I was terrible at this game? Great apprehension Perry Mason. 

Kidding aside, skills at gaming and athletics depreciate as we get older. Quick twitch and reaction decrease quicker than we want. Plus, starting families and focus on work translates to a lot less time for gaming. However: the really cool thing is, you get to come home to a family that loves you and you get to spend the money you earn on vacations and doing other really fun stuff. 

To be a goat at your level at a video game would mean playing more than 2-6 hours a week. Unfortunately, that's all people in their mid 40's can manage. 

Enjoy it while you can and I hope you are super successful and start a great family in the future.
Wait that’s crazy. Maybe I’ll go back to the grind
Ah, ok, no problem, thanks for letting me know
Thank you

It may try to match with ps users,,,,but it won't most of the time,,,it will be a preference setting probably.
It was forced crossplay at launch. The subreddit was full of PS5 players crying about it. 

I stopped playing TCM when Gun prevented PC players from playing with consoles. I don't know what's happened with the game since then. If it's an option now, that came after launch.
    I think that may have been a bug because there are articles from launch week describing how to enable/disable cross-play. Or at the very least an oversight they were forced to correct. 

Why did they stop PC players from playing with consoles? That’s a game I don’t see mouse and keyboard having much of an advantage on. 

I read that Gun is passing over the development to another studio to keep the live service going. Weird how short they worked on it directly after launch.
        > Why did they stop PC players from playing with consoles? 

It released without an anti-cheat and it didn't take long for people to start using cheats. About a month after launch, Gun took PC out of the cross play mix. Current gen consoles still played together. PS4 and Xbox One were never cross play. 

The combination of so many Dead by Daylight players (not the most toxic gaming community, but its toxic enough that i want no part of it) and whining PS5 players afraid of games outside of their walled garden took away a lot of the enjoyment I had in the game and interacting with other players outside of the game (such as the subreddit). We complain about this subreddit but compared with the TCM subreddit, this place is downright cordial and professional.

>That’s a game I don’t see mouse and keyboard having much of an advantage on.

I'd say mouse and keyboard were a disadvantage in that game. It's a whole lot easier to kite killers when you can turn your thumbstick in a full circle than it is for a killer to turn their whole forearm in a full circle to match the movement with a mouse.
            Cheaters are the worst. Gotta ruin it for the rest of us. 

DBD is a toxic ( and thirsty ) community for sure lol. It’s a shame TCM was plagued by these things.. I’m worried Killer Klowns from Outer Space will end up in the same boat. 

I love the SoT subreddit, even if it can sometimes be aggressive. Makes sense for pirates at least.
Ya its just the crowd, there are a ton of solo sloopers who are really active on this site and will swear up and down its the best way to play the game, the best way to learn the game, etc. They think that if you play with a crew, you dont learn to do everything. Which is wild to me. Kinda tells me theyve just never really played with a crew.

And I believe they intrepet me saying that 'playing with a crew is the best way to learn' as Im saying they were somehow 'wrong' by learning that way.  Which isnt what I meant.
And that can only happen when you're solo?
    Not at all... I think both ways of playing can teach alot.. solo just worked better for me.
> Yes, it says it's a "preference" in the same way the medication you take says a possible side effect is death.

What a terrible, absolutely random, comparison. 

>But despite this, game after game does their crossplay opt out this way

Do they? Many games also dont do that. So you seem to be just randomly saying things at this point.

Were not talking about other games and what they do, but what SoT is doing. And we are certainly not talking about medications.
    > What a terrible, absolutely random, comparison.

What are you talking about? It's an analogy and a perfectly fitting one. It's just a disclaimer man. Lots of things you do in life have disclaimers just so the company covers their ass. There is nothing random about it in the context of our conversation. Google "analogy" if you're still confused.

> Do they? Many games also dont do that. So you seem to be just randomly saying things at this point. Were not talking about other games and what they do, but what SoT is doing. And we are certainly not talking about medications.

Well, you're wrong. Please list the "many" games that have "console only" crossplay opt out where Xbox/PS/Nintendo can play together without PC. The list is exceedingly small (off the top of my head I can only think of Apex and Destiny 2). Most games if you opt out, you are with your platform only.

Me saying this is not random in the slightest. If we're trying to predict what will happen with SoT, we can look to past examples to see what happened with other games. And looking at past evidence, *the vast majority of games* don't give a "console only" option like we're talking about here (and if they do, it's only for a "ranked" mode which SoT does not have). I hope SoT is different than that trend, but you saying we shouldn't look at current trends to predict what will happen in this case is a very bizarre take.

There are some factors that make SoT different which is why I'm hoping Rare does the sensible thing here. Namely that the game is going cross platform many years after launch and it's Microsoft rather than a 3rd party studio. So I'm hoping for the best, but we cannot say one way or the other right now.

Your personality and identity are molded by your experiences AND your nature. Anyone claiming its only one way or the other are full of it. You can't even really separate the two to even begin to figure out which is which on an individual scale.

Cheaters are the worst. Gotta ruin it for the rest of us. 

DBD is a toxic ( and thirsty ) community for sure lol. It’s a shame TCM was plagued by these things.. I’m worried Killer Klowns from Outer Space will end up in the same boat. 

I love the SoT subreddit, even if it can sometimes be aggressive. Makes sense for pirates at least.
For sure, all good.
Since day 1.  Skeleton health varied with your trade company reputation from day 1 right up until the voyage overhaul.  Were you there?  Did you play through Athena Voyages before they had seasons?
    I’ve been playing since before release. Yes. I’ve been there and you’re wrong.
I can safely say, as someone who makes new accounts and new pirates very often, that before season 11 skeletons in voyages took 2 hits to kill in lower level voyages.
    Okay buddy 👍 go ahead and believe your own bullshit. The rest of the world will go ahead with reality.
    It's well documented all over the internet as well.  Varying health based on voyage.  It's even in some of phuzzybond's older videos.  But that redditor you're replying to has invested too many insults to admit he's wrong.

    What has been proven wrong lol? That your enviroment doesn't affect you while you're growing up? That's just blatantly false on every possible metric. There's not even a concrete way of testing nature vs. nurture because you can't isolate variables that are always interacting and present. As a parent you control their access to the internet just as you'd control their access to certain people. No good parent believes that kids should have unbridled internet access.
