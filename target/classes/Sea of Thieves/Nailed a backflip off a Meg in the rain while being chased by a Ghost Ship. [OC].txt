[[Nailed a backflip off a Meg in the rain while being chased by a Ghost Ship. [OC]]]





I posted this awhile ago but it got deleted. Btw this was completely on purpose. Trust me I‚Äôm a professional

Edit: Y‚Äôall gotta relax with the skeleton/ghost ship thing. Day one players all know that skelly ships were called both before the actual ghosts ships came about. Either way I‚Äôm wrong cuz it was a galleon üòÖ I wish I coulda seen the look on their faces after that tho.
    Can you teach me your ways master?
        If ye find me on the open seas I‚Äôll show ya a thing or two. Not the backflip though I‚Äôll never be able to pull that shit off again
            Okay  But what if you find me first?
                Yer booty is mine üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è
                    This guy pirates
                You wouldn‚Äôt know I‚Äôm a ninja on these here waters
You win, I‚Äôm deleting the game.
    Nah just give it a few tries you‚Äôll nail it üòÖ
That wasn't a ghost ship chasing you. That was a player galleon.
    Op might want to get their eyes check. I mean they also hit-n-ran that poor Meg!
        To be fair that Meg had a death wish I swear
            Maybe it had the right of way, clearly op didn‚Äôt look before he turned.
                Shit you‚Äôre right. I‚Äôll write a nice letter to his family
                    Just set up a go fund me at this point, they could probably use the doubloons for medical expenses!
                    Send them a ham
    Even better to back flip over.

    Huh. I feel slightly more badass. I couldn‚Äôt tell if it was a galleon or not cuz I was uhhhh..upside down. I wish I could have seen their POV lmao
        Ghost ships only spawn with Flameheart or OoS voyages. Plus they don't really chase players.
            Notice new players tend to use ghost ship and skeleton ship interchangeable my guess is OP meant skeleton ship.
                It‚Äôs because ghost ship is an already coined and somewhat familiar term (a ship that has no crew on it, an empty ship on the seas) whereas skeleton ship is a bit more of new territory. When I would accidentally say ‚Äúghost ship‚Äù, it‚Äôs because it was a ship without a player crew, not even thinking about there being *actual* ships that were ghosts. 

Also, PotC is to blame. They call the Black Pearl a ghost ship, and the crew is all skeletons.

That‚Äôs how I pissed off the PL teaching me how to play at least. I still have to catch myself from saying ghost ship.
                They are interchangeable. You understood what they meant, didn't you? And it's not just new players. I've been here over a year and I call it a ghost ship because it sounds cooler and rolls off the tongue easier. I don't get why people insist on calling them skeleton ships when ghost ship is an already existing term that covers the same thing.
                    Me personally it doesn‚Äôt bother me if people use them that way. But in reality they aren‚Äôt interchangeable they are two separating thing in the game. But if people want to use it that way fine by me!
                        They're all various boats full of various undead at the end of the day!
                            Honestly it‚Äôs a game to be enjoyed but that‚Äôs like saying a sloop is a galleon. Information does matter, just not worth getting mad at new players or players who are learning.

                    No one is getting butthurt, except apparently you. I‚Äôm just pointing out some people use them interchangeably and some call them skeleton and ghost ships. Even the game calls them skeleton and ghost ships, they are different things but honestly both ways are fine. 

If your theory was right we wouldn‚Äôt have different missions to kill skeleton and ghost ships‚Ä¶

Edit: Since the poster above removed his ‚Äúbutthurt‚Äù comment I‚Äôll add some clarity. In reality they are different assets, in practicality they are the same thing. Call them what you want, enjoy the game it‚Äôs a game after all.
                        I think he‚Äôs just trying to say that before ghost ships were a thing both terms were used interchangeably for some reason. Which they def were cuz I literally always called out ghost ship when I saw a skelly. Not sure why üßê
                            The guy edited his comment. My original point was some people use them interchangeably. His original comment said ‚Äúold players use to call everything ghost ships and only new players get  butthurt about it‚Äù 

My whole original point is people use both‚Ä¶
                                Ohhhhhhh my mistake. I agree with you me matey ![img](emote|t5_38oz1|2295)
                Yep sure did. I played day one when this dropped its just been a hot minute since I‚Äôve been on
                True. I try to educate the playerbase ;)
        You were‚Ä¶. *inverted*
            [(top gun)](https://youtu.be/wUZxSf_P2r0)
    Pretty lame of the galleon. They're chasing an (empty looking) sloop into the coral fortress, which is presumably just doing the tall tale. Glad they got rare'd like that.
        You can't assume that. For all you know the sloop could've been running away **because** they had loot.
            I can neither confirm nor deny that I had millions worth of gold below deck.
        It‚Äôs a pirate game man. You can follow and fight whoever the hell you feel like. If people think you‚Äôre being a dick then you‚Äôre probably fitting the roll pretty well
            Careful, opinions aren't welcome in reddit, especially when you're right
    Yep My bad its an older video and I just glanced at the ship once before posting üòï
    Imagine being on that galleon and seeing the sloop backflip and now they‚Äôre behind them
        You're already sunk. Nani!?
No one expects the 360 nose flip reversal

![gif](giphy|Wt6kNaMjofj1jHkF7t)
    Exactly my thoughts
lol the Jack Sparrow quote at the end
    The best
    It's such a pro Jack Sparrow move, and then the quote. I'm thinking this was a deleted scene from POTC and not gameplay footage now ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thinking_face_hmm)
Dude that is fucking awesome, those waves by the coral fortress are insane lmao
Hahaha if I was the one chasing you, I would have to surrender out of respect for that move
Wow, what the... 

So, the rain is... idk. The "storm" around the Coral Fortress only causes large waves. It doesn't fill your ship with water or damage the ship. My crew refers to it as "the fake storm". 

Secondly, that's not a ghost ship. It's not even a skeleton ship. It's another player ship. 

Thirdly, it's nice to see that megs are still super bugged. Not like them launching ships is potentially sinking them or anything... 

Still, I bet those players had a laugh!

So how *did* Jack get that hat?
    probably did a sick backflip
Imagine if your crewmate had dropped off right as you were over the galleon and anchored/killed them as you turned the wheel and got on cannons when you fell.
    I now need to see a pirates of the Caribbean movie done in the style of recent fast and furious movies.

Directed by Michal bay of course.
"Did everyone see that? Because I will NOT be doing it again"
Impressive
Bro this is so unbelievably insane!!!
    Thanks bro üòé
Tony Hawk Pro Pirate II
it‚Äôs a player ship lmao. no wonder people call hacks when someone kills them
that was clean SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEESH
What? & Awesome!
Excellent form, 10/10
"That's enough adventure for one day, thank you."
Bro you have my sides in orbit, much like your ship! XD That may have been the best/flashiest outplay I've ever seen. Superhero backflip, while the enemy careens into a rock and you get away scott free.
    The Jack Sparrow way
        Like if I were that galleon, and we just got absolutely dumpstered that smoothly I legit wouldn't even be mad. I'd salute you and just let my ship sink lmao.
Nice one üôÇ
‚Ä¢0‚Ä¢
Parkour!
Dam nice
10/10
‚ÄúNOT NOW JACK!‚Äù
parkour! that was great
You've jumped the shark.  It's all gg from here!
"I'll hit the brakes, he'll fly right by!"
    Exactly what I was thinking! Lol
Classic StarFox maneuver!
Nailed it!
what sails are those?
    Uhhh Blue Horizon I think? They came with the pass a season or two ago I think
        thanks! i took a hiatus around that time. a shame.
A feet only previously accomplished by Tech Decks
    \*feat
That's pretty awrsome

Unrelated, why do videos on Reddit look worse now. And why are they worse to interact with. Why did Reddit do this.
That was a player galleon, so some real players stood dumbstruck like, ‚Äúdid that fuck I was chasing just do a flip over me ‚Äú?
That looked so fun.
    It really was
"Do a barrel roll!"
The Meg sequel is coming along nicely.
Jack sparrow saying to remind him to tell you how he got his hat was the icing on the cake for me haha
+(1e+9999) style points
That‚Äôs got to be the best pirate I have ever seen
I read the title and thought that surely, there was no way it was actually that good. But the video delivered.
    Glad I could be of assistance üôÇ
        What pistol is that?
![gif](giphy|Vg5wkw9CxnMZCbcGWh)

The kraken approves
    I will‚Ä¶accept that.
*that‚Äôs go to be the best pirate I‚Äôve ever seen*

**so it may seem**
I‚Äôd be so mad if i were that other ship
    If I saw someone do this I‚Äôd just applaud üòÇ
Swear the skelly ships have twin engines with how fast they are.
If I was old enough to have a credit card I‚Äôd give you all the awards I have Jesus Christ that was awesome
that's gotta be the best pirate i've ever seen \*earrapes pirates of the Caribbean soundtrack\*
Not a ghost ship lad
Ghost ship?
Reminding you to tell me how you got that hat? #BeMorePirate
How do you summon the meg?
u/savevideobot
What ghost ship?
    My bad! It‚Äôs a Galleon. Doesn‚Äôt really matter tho? Did ya see the perfect backflip? Cuz I will never be able to pull that off everrrrr again
The one scene from cars
ghost ships dont chase you, they circle an island.
    Yeah that‚Äôs my bad it was a typo. Wasn‚Äôt even a skelly ship either it was a 4 player galleon
Advanced evasive maneuvers
CAPTAIN


Yeh- Yeah?


........LOOOOOOOOOOOOOK!
What gun is that??
So thats how you beat the game‚ÄΩ

My ni
Would have been hilarious if you killed the pursuing ship (idk, haven‚Äôt ever played this game but firing cannons would have been the cherry on top)
    That flip sent my mate that was with me to the moon! Only reason I didn‚Äôt fly off is the grip I had on that wheel lol
        Lmfaoooo, that‚Äôs hilarious as hell. Is there fall damage in this game?
            Oh yeah i fall and die all the time lol but ur usually perfectly fine when you land in water

Oh wow.
Can Reddit collectively find a clip from the galleon? No way they didn‚Äôt clip it
Hang on‚Ä¶ Black Pearl ship set chasing you‚Ä¶ was this after a fort of fortune? If so that was probably me as I remember chasing a sloop with those sails back and forth eventually nearing the coral temple and I vaguely remember a meg
Can you teach me your ways master?

Maybe it had the right of way, clearly op didn‚Äôt look before he turned.
    Shit you‚Äôre right. I‚Äôll write a nice letter to his family
        Just set up a go fund me at this point, they could probably use the doubloons for medical expenses!
        Send them a ham
Notice new players tend to use ghost ship and skeleton ship interchangeable my guess is OP meant skeleton ship.
    It‚Äôs because ghost ship is an already coined and somewhat familiar term (a ship that has no crew on it, an empty ship on the seas) whereas skeleton ship is a bit more of new territory. When I would accidentally say ‚Äúghost ship‚Äù, it‚Äôs because it was a ship without a player crew, not even thinking about there being *actual* ships that were ghosts. 

Also, PotC is to blame. They call the Black Pearl a ghost ship, and the crew is all skeletons.

That‚Äôs how I pissed off the PL teaching me how to play at least. I still have to catch myself from saying ghost ship.
    They are interchangeable. You understood what they meant, didn't you? And it's not just new players. I've been here over a year and I call it a ghost ship because it sounds cooler and rolls off the tongue easier. I don't get why people insist on calling them skeleton ships when ghost ship is an already existing term that covers the same thing.
        Me personally it doesn‚Äôt bother me if people use them that way. But in reality they aren‚Äôt interchangeable they are two separating thing in the game. But if people want to use it that way fine by me!
            They're all various boats full of various undead at the end of the day!
                Honestly it‚Äôs a game to be enjoyed but that‚Äôs like saying a sloop is a galleon. Information does matter, just not worth getting mad at new players or players who are learning.

        No one is getting butthurt, except apparently you. I‚Äôm just pointing out some people use them interchangeably and some call them skeleton and ghost ships. Even the game calls them skeleton and ghost ships, they are different things but honestly both ways are fine. 

If your theory was right we wouldn‚Äôt have different missions to kill skeleton and ghost ships‚Ä¶

Edit: Since the poster above removed his ‚Äúbutthurt‚Äù comment I‚Äôll add some clarity. In reality they are different assets, in practicality they are the same thing. Call them what you want, enjoy the game it‚Äôs a game after all.
            I think he‚Äôs just trying to say that before ghost ships were a thing both terms were used interchangeably for some reason. Which they def were cuz I literally always called out ghost ship when I saw a skelly. Not sure why üßê
                The guy edited his comment. My original point was some people use them interchangeably. His original comment said ‚Äúold players use to call everything ghost ships and only new players get  butthurt about it‚Äù 

My whole original point is people use both‚Ä¶
