[[just wanted to cook bananas for the boys (]]





Lol my crew is so chaotic it's not even asked why the ship is on fire it's just accepted
    It would be weird if it was _not_ on fire
        Or often most times exploding.
            I have a friend that like to try to sneak kegs on board lmfao he will light them and drop them at ur feet to
    “Frank, the ship’s on fire again”

“Ahh don’t worry about it, it’s gonna sink to the Kraken we’re fighting anyways”
        subsequent weary one correct steep panicky jobless ripe price squealing

    Lmao not even questioning how just everyone yelling “BUCKETS NOWWWW”
    “Hey the cabin is on fire again go bail it out and check the stove”
My very first time playing with friends on a 4 man galleon (last weekend), and one of my buddies was very excited about fishing and killing animals to cook their meat when he found out you could. Eventually we go to an island with 3 X's on it for a Gold Hoarders quest. When we get back to the ship which is now on fire near the helm already, my friend goes "Dammit, my porkchop!". He's not allowed to cook anymore.
    xD he shares my gold fish like attention span.
    I wasn’t allowed to cook until the new designated cook almost burned the ship down a few times before getting to our destination. Im allowed to cook again
My favorite thing to do on other people's ships if they've just been chasing me all game
    That is actually very clever
        I also eat all my fishing bait before being boarded, I've usually got nothing on my ship worth taking so might as well waste their time if they insist on bothering me
            That's also a fast way to get a bucket of sick, without even loosing control of your pirate (being drunk). Haven't gotten the opportunity to use this on other players yet though...
                It expedites the process, I don't even need to catch it, just sword lunge into range
                    When my crew ends up in combat usually a couple of us will eat bait and catch some sick in a bucket. The tactical puke throw has saved us a few times.
                        What does a tactical puke throw accomplish?
                            You can block enough of the opponent's vision for about 3 seconds that they can't block an attack or shoot accurately. It's a blind that buys a short tactical advantage.
                                Oh that's awesome, I'm still learning the basics of combat so I think it'll be a while before I'm throwing tactical vomit
                                    If you can get a crew mate to eat bait and puke on you you'll see how it blocks your vision.
                    That's true. Mostly you are going to vomit multiple times, so you can just run around and hopefully hit someone I guess xD
            So you're basically like this one left 4 dead zombie called the Spitter who spits acid on them ! :D
                I remember that one but yeah,pretty much that
            Omg I’m going to do this now ty!!

                    Yea, guess that's gotta be frustrating... It does sound funny though to slowly burn down another ship with a banana, and they can't do anything about it lol
    I leave a banana on the stove of every unattended ship I find
        It would be weird if you didn't
    "Those guys are gods. They put a banana on our oven."

—A twitch streamer that chased us once, whose ship caught fire 3 times before anyone noticed what we'd done
        Once had a player do it to me in Arena, which is funny, because there's not even really enough time for it to catch on fire. But I still respected his attempt to play the long game!
    It's sometimes a pain to pull from the inventory, but I like to throw leeches on the pan. Blends into the skillet nicely, and they burn 5s quicker than fruit. Plant a powder keg next to it for a 10s time-bomb (but that's a rare occurance)
Once I was on a sloop by myself and started cooking some pork for some reason as I was coming into an outpost. I immediately forgot about it and started unloading loot. I think I was low on supplies so I went around checking barrels. Came back to half the ship on fire. I assumed someone was hiding or came up on a rowboat bc there were no ships around. As I'm putting out the fire I realize it keeps starting up and finally realized what was happening.
    I love that story xD I'm imagining you having the hardest adrenaline rush when you see your ship burning, prepared for the fight of your life, but then you remember it was just the short attention span and a kitchen accident that led to absolute chaos 😂

I can relate so much and I'm glad to know that I'm not the only one with a short memory 😁
        Hahaha yeah. It took me waaay too long to understand so for awhile I thought someone was messing with me. I only understood when I decided to just jump in the ocean and throw water on the deck like a madman and it still kept flaring up.
    I, too, learned that unattended meat catches fire from forgetting the pork.
My buddy did this once. Our team now has a policy. If you start a food fire:

1. We will lock you in the brig. 
2. We will eat worms. 
3. We will puke into a bucket. 
4. We will throw the puke on you.
    This should be one of the written rules in the tavern xD
Damn Tuckers
    :(
u/Ceebizzle97 100% you
    HahahahHhaha 😂😂😂
        Literally the other night 😂😂😂
            Someone’s been exposed:0
                It happened on our first voyage out that I posted the loot haul on here 🤣
Bruhh banana bread isn't in the game yet. Take it off the stove
    Gotta get those Season 1 points for burning food
All for a banana
Place keg. 

Cook banana.

????

Profit
Just here for Linus!
    All hail Linus !
There is a well documented rule that there should never be bananas on boats.
Soon may the Linus man come  
To bring us tips, guides and ram   
One day when the building is done  
We'll take our PC and gooooo....
Replace banana with coconut and that's my crew last night
    I like your crew ;)
        The fire really started spreading after we were stopped by a kraken mere moments after a skeleton ship

"Someone grab the cannonball crate!"

"WHY IS THE SHIP ON FIRE?"

"WHO PUT A FUCKING COCONUT ON THE STOVE?!"

"I DON'T KNOW"

"WHY IS HE STILL FISHING??? THE SHIP'S ON FIRE AND THERE'S A KRAKEN AND HE'S FISHING?!"
            " why is he still fishing " 😂 that honestly is even more epic than forgetting you had food on the stove
                On that night I heard my friend yell like I've never heard before
Cook coconuts they burn faster
    Ooh thanks for the advise, now my friends are gonna hate me even more
        [removed]
So recently I've gotten into the trend where we leave our storage crate at the end of our session, but I burn all the bananas before I put them in
    That was YOU! 😂
        Probably, I've done it everytime since ancient vaults 🤣
Just cook pineapples if they piss u off.
I legit had to put out a fire on an allied ship during the Fort of the Damned for this exact reason. Hilarious in the moment, hilarious months later.
Not going to lie I have a bad habit of leaving fish on the stove and setting the boat on fire 🤣

But I've also taken that habit and used it to troll enemy boats by launching on to them and slapping a banana on the stove between attacking them. By the time I kill them, or them killing me they forget about the banana until it sets their boat on fire rofl.

I'm in the triple digits now for lighting up enemy boats that way.
Nice edit!
Lmfao
I still think they should have caramelized bananas when cooked for a short amount of time
This can be a good way if you need to set the enemy ship on fire but you dont have grenades or you want to make a time bomb.
u/iamsufferingalot Sound like someone?
LMFAO
i can relate to that
"forgot"
    ;))
I was preparing a beautiful Bananas foster dish for the crew until some bloke yelled at me to “man the sails” 
His fault really.
    I know right ! You can't distract the chef if you want your ship to stay intact 😁
Who eats cooked bananas cooked coconut's is real cuisine
Sometimes when we fly the dealers embisary we light the bowsprit on fire for effect. It does not spread and it looks awesome
This happened to me
No bananas on boats!
This exact thing happened with my friend while we were on a sloop. Banana and all
Burn banana is new meta, change my mind.
u/jetmonty720 we all know who this is
    Even I sometimes fall victim to a little banana 😩
Me and my friends were doing a tall tale and when we came back up from a cave i screamed "WHY IS THE SHIP ON FIRE" and one of my crewmates forgot he put a banana on the stove before we went into the cave
The old banana on the stove trick lmao
Those are the exact moments that make me appreciate the game is PvP and there are no safezones.

"What? Our ship is on fire? ... ... Hm, them pesky Reaper tuckers, huh?!"
i giggled at this. 10/10 meme <3
Lol, one time i left a shark meat on the stove, and wen my brother was going to play, the ship was on fire
Me everytime my friend catches a fish and lets me cook it
Lmao
First time i did this litteraly went up forgot about it and walked back just as it started freaked out my friend put it out and said you cant cook bannas did it a few more times to see if i could get that sweet spot never found it
where banana
thats a thing that can happen?? i am big noob to pirate game
Im so happy im not the only one.
I once got put in the brig by my friends because I cooked all the bananas
Leeches on the pan
Its called we do a little trolling
Tried cooking fish bait just for it to look like shit.
Lost 7 skulls and 4 chests this way. I laughed and cried at the same time
Guilty
So thaaats why out ship suddenly burned down!!!
    Sorry :')
        *cronch*
reminds me of call me kevin
    xD he always causing chaos
You know I'm on the internet enough to know that this dude is a streamer but I still have yet to find out who and it's killing me.
    He's a Youtuber. His channel is Linus Tech Tips. He does a lot of PC building and whatnot, if that helps.
        My man.
You can't cook bananas
    Found that out too :(
        No fruit can be cooked
