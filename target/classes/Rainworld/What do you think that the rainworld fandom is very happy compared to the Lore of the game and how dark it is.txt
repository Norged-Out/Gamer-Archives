[[What do you think that the rainworld fandom is very happy compared to the Lore of the game and how dark it is]]





we small scug, small scug concerned with surviving  
lore too complicated for small scug  
scug is happy just surviving and taking care of pups
    I think Hunter and other scugs are adults, but survivor and Monk are literally puppies who got lost
        i dont think they are slugpups since they are much taller than an actual slugpup (and also take care of slugpups)
            I think they're young adults. A little taller than slugpups, but not fully grown. I also think this is why they can't eat from corpses, which makes Hunter, Arti, and Gourmand adults, whereas Riv, Survivor and Monk are younger. Saint and Spearmaster are edge cases.
                Saint is just either vegetarian or allergic to meat, probably an adult. Spearmaster is an edge case since you don't see them eat anything, just siphoning nutrients
            They grew up after getting lost

We‚Äôre incredibly silly and wholesome, contrasting the tone of the game we‚Äôre all fans of.
From what I've seen, it's like that with all fandoms. The more serious the source media is, the sillier the fandom, and vice versa. Look at the Omori fandom, it's all stair jokes and "burgers on my mind". On the other hand, you would not believe how bronies just talk about MLP with a straight face and the most serious tone.
    i do wonder, is there a psychological explanation for this?
    r/stunfisk and r/anarchychess can attest to that
    Shaw
    Warhammer 40k fandom is also great example
I always had a weakness for tiny white creatures, they look so cute, yet mysterious.
Slugcat is you
    Slugcat is cute so you too
        What
            So if slugcat is you and slugcat is cute that's mining you have to be cute too because slugcat is you
                But baba is you
                    And you is unmove
I played all 4 of these, love all 4

Why is the cute lil white animal thing so common in indie games lol
My theory is that Ori series takes place millennia after Rain World. Nearly all superstructures have decayed, but purposed organisms continued to evolve. Underground powered structures seen in Ori could be remnants of iterators' infrastructure.
    My theory is that Hollow Knight is a prequel to Rain World, and >!Gorb is an ancient that tried to ascend, but became an echo instead. !<
        And the reason why cycles exist in Rain World is simply because Baba accidentally created an infinite loop.

    Maybe the Gumon are ancestors or creations of the Overseers?
    There‚Äôs no metal or modified metal in Ori tho? Most structures are made by (I lost their name, the four armed desert guys from Will of the Wisps) and some other beings like the Gumon I guess. No signs of iterator structure or old ones
    Hold on a second. [Does this boss not look familiar? Like the rot, maybe](https://youtu.be/lykAm-lJVss)
    gorb is like plant mom, plant mom is tree, ori is leaf of tree, ori is like scug, scug is small baba is you and baby, baby is scug
Evolution at work

The Knight: *"A harsh, dark, and dangerous environment led to this species of BABA developing a hard exoskeleton and the ability to use tools to survive against the predators and threats in the wastes."*

Ori: *"This species of BABA found itself in a forested and highly vertical ecosystem. This led to the strengthening of the limbs to better climb trees, along with larger ears to hear predators hiding in the underbrush."*

Scug: *"Interestingly, this species of BABA appears to have been genetically modified by advanced technology. It has developed thick, self-cleaning fur to clean metallic surfaces when rubbed against. After the fall of the civilization that created them, this species of BABA developed social behaviors to help survival"*

There is something about shared trauma that always brings a community together.
    With Baba the trauma is puzzle hell, with the others it's varying degrees of platform hell.
So baba is purposed organism?
    Baba is prototype for purpose algorithms
whats the middle one?
    A cyan arrow
        bro you know what i mean
            Ori from Ori and the blind forest/Ori and the will of the whisps
                thanks
I think it‚Äôs an evolution starting at baba is you, scug, CREATURE OF LIGHT (Ori), and vessel
probably every fandom is sillier than source material lol
    Juice galaxy fandom is probably more serious than juice galaxy
WHOA
baba is scug
sir you just described the omori fandom
Scugs are very cute and very funny little guys. Being compared to Ori should be am honor.
Basically all the serious games with dark lore I like have a very silly fandom.
Maybe it's to cope with all the trauma/bad things happens in it.
    shaw
        Git gud
Fandoms of serious IPs love to cute-ify and happify the source material. A good story is what grips you and stays with you for months, but a happy meme is what gets you the most likes on a post.

It's hard to grip someone with an emotional post out of context. It's easy to make them grin with Yippee Rivulet.
baba scug ori vessel
I like it. Both mossbag and Daszombes is funny guys telling stories about some grim games.
(Bro I can't believe that nonsense ended in a theory about the evolution and connection of these games üíÄ )
I approve of this
Couldn't crosspost to r/BabaIsYou because it was read-only after the 3rd-party app removal, although i did crosspost it to r/HollowKnight .
I'm a little shook now.  These are my 3 favorite games... Apparently I have a type.
What is the "common ancestor" from?
    Baba is you, a puzzle game where you can bend the rules by moving blocks around with words on them. It's one of those games that really makes you think as you start breaking the world around you.
The 3 greatest metroidvania
We love explosions
Oh hey it‚Äôs baba!
BaBa is All
The darkest of times tend to spark up the brightest of hopes.
It goes from baba -> scug -> Knight -> Ori
    Wouldn't it go baba > scug > ori > knight? I feel like knight would be the most developed one
        Im going off on design here baba being the least humanoid and ori being the most
            ori literally looks like a monkey bro
                The knight looks like a humunculus
                    Yeah exactly
Rain World is just a 3 for 1 deal: adorable innocent animals + terrifying monsters + pseudo religious themes.

Personally I think the juxtaposition of cute vs dark makes for good stories/settings.
CUTE SLUG CAT IS CUTE
Have i seen this before?
When things have things in common with other things
"a helpless but smart little creature living and surviving a big and dangerous world" is one of my favorite concepts
you mean...everything is just Baba?!
Funny how Baba is from a puzzle game, but the divergent are each from a different flavor of Metroidvania platformer. The top adheres to the genre's formula the strongest, and the bottom the least.
So you are telling me that a bug (or ghost thing sorry I don‚Äôt play Hollow Knight correct me if I‚Äôm wrong), a plant and a scug has a common ancestor?

Okay üòâüëç
How did I miss it, they are all part of the goober-verse
Minos prime should be the final evolution of one of these lmao
I love Ori's creature design so much, and seeing this makes my brain explode in happiness. 

I'm concerned with the lore as far as the iterators and environments. But when I take the control of a scug. I have no worries. I just wanna be stronk and rotund. Happy in my lane. Playing gourmand.
actually, there's no such thing as "code" or "game engines"

It's just a little Baba moving blocks around according to your commands
Is that.. a sheep?
Omg that‚Äôs baba
The rain world community is happy because the game is f**king amazing, and probably the most emotional experience I'll ever have
    you are right rainworld is unique
    Not saying Hollow knight wasn't like that, hollow knight was just a little more lacking in the lore, and vastness of the game
        I only put the image to fill in and it causes a lot of stir
At first there was only baba. Baba was a simple minded creature, only being able to move left, right, up, and down.
In baba's world, the rules of the universe were constantly rewritten, and so they eventually settled. One being evolved to be plagued by immortality, another riddled with sorrow and loss, and one born forth from abyss itself.
is that first one baba from that one baba is you game?
I think Hunter and other scugs are adults, but survivor and Monk are literally puppies who got lost
    i dont think they are slugpups since they are much taller than an actual slugpup (and also take care of slugpups)
        I think they're young adults. A little taller than slugpups, but not fully grown. I also think this is why they can't eat from corpses, which makes Hunter, Arti, and Gourmand adults, whereas Riv, Survivor and Monk are younger. Saint and Spearmaster are edge cases.
            Saint is just either vegetarian or allergic to meat, probably an adult. Spearmaster is an edge case since you don't see them eat anything, just siphoning nutrients
