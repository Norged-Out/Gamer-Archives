[[These weapons don't get enough attentionpraise.]]


Yea they're used and all but I'm talking about their unique designs. Every other weapon in the game works as an effective weapon of the archetype. But these guy's no!

Grab your nearest pipe and go beat a treasure holder. Taking a stroll and a fatui agent shows up? Wack him with an umbrella. Go fend off eremites with a fish!

I cant overstat how much I love games that let you use non weapons as such. I'm just waiting for the day we get a shovel for a polearm. Or a half eaten golden apple for a catalyst. 

I want to go toe-to-toe with the heavily principles with nothing but a random tree branch I snagged on the way there.


my eula likes her giant frozen tuna (im broke and cannot pull her weapon so Im forcing her to use a fish as a weapon against her will)
    If you explore dragonspine there's a craftable physical dmg weapon you can get.
        It's free if you light up the torches
            [removed]
                No one mentioned swords
                    They're a bot
        Where?
            It's actually very hard to find if you don't already know where to look. I love it when games add very esoteric secrets with actually interesting rewards - and the Dragonspine weapons aren't the best but its still really cool to get them as rewards for exploring the nooks and crannies of the zone. I would just follow the wiki or a youtube guide like [right here.](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Snow-Tombed_Starsilver#Availability) It might take you ages to find otherwise
                The Dragonspine weapons are quite usable on cryo characters, specially the Snowtomb Starsilver for Eula. It matches her kit (physical dmg bonus% and extra instance of dmg from the icicle when the enemy has cryo aplied) and design.
                    If by "especially" you mean "only" then sure.

Dragonspine Spear is total ass, and even cryo characters prefer Crescent Pike for a physical build. They both cost the same billets, and R1 Crescent Pike is still better than R5 Dragonspine.

Frostbearer was and will still be ass once we finally get our first ever cryo catalyst(s).
                Is it the one where you need 7 artifacts to open some door?
            Don't bother. It's ass. Sea lord is better in an r5 to r5 comparison.
                But sealord is event limited.
                    The question is the weapon comparison, not about availability. If you have Sealord good for you but if not than use that Dragonspine claymore for Eula.
                        Yeah, but im assuming that the dude doesnt have sealord or r5 based on their comments, so this comment serves no purpose to him.
                            I don't think they're trying to be relevant to someone else, it's just pure comparison
                    [deleted]
                        And the person you replied to asked "Where" and "But it's event limited"

It's easier to assume that they don't have it and answer the question than to outright deny it. They just wanted to know how to get it, not if it's better or not.
                            Then why the downvotes before the mention of event limited? The comment chain was making it sound like the one from dragonspine was better and should replace the tuna, so "don't bother, sea lord is better" is a very reasonable thing to say at that moment.
                                Yeah, but the question is "Where is the Craftable Phys Weapon?"

Not "Is it better than Tuna?"

So those who deemed the response as irrelevant, downvoted. Simple as that.
                                    And the answer is it doesn't matter where, just keep using the tuna. Totally relevant. Maybe they thought it was the same user with Eula, or at least also letting them know too.

If anything, the OP has the irrelevant response, yet they have 200 upvotes on their reply.
                Wait, how is the sealors better?
                    More burst damage
                    The Starsilver passive is too bad. Sealord has less base damage but it's bonuses more than make up for it. Especially with refinement, since r5 Starsilver is equally useless.
        The fish is better on Eula than that weapon.
        Said weapon isn’t even better than prototype archaic
        Some random coop Spanish player helped me get the sword, solve puzzles for some cheats and cleared up the mobs for new me.. despite the language barrier he/she played like a live quest for me even when I dint stepped at dragonspine at the time
    I remember once I joined a low AR random co op with the fish claymore.

And the dude kicked me thinking I was hacking.
    Its not frozen. It pretends to be dead until it finds a worthy opponent.
    B-b-big fish???
    The new crafted claymore, Tidal Shadow, is also not too bad on her. And it fits her quite well imo.
    That tuna is one lucky guy.
Great time to add a baguette greatsword
    If that baguette is a sword, you can damn well expect that my Furina would be running around with it.
        imagine we get a cake themed 4☆ weapon in an event being perfect for Furina
        Or Polearm for Arle 😳
            no leaks pls
    If it's an event item, I will make damn sure that I make time to get the item and max it. Baguette sword or Claymore let's gooooo
    A croissant bow too
    I would rip my redhorn off Itto just to use a baguette claymore on him. Even if it’s EM or HP scaling, idc - I will make it work.
    And a Quaso Catalyst
My Kuki loves her umbrella!
    I use it on kazuha. Perfectly matches his colors!
        It really does look amazing on kazuha!
            [removed]
                Cinnabar kazuha meta
                I think you might have replied to the wrong comment, as I am very confused lol
        This. I used to put the umbrella on Kuki. But when I got Kazuha, I switched. Though it's ironic that he uses an umbrella as a sword, for being a descendant of Kaedehara clan, famous for their bladesmithing lol. He's a bit silly this way.
            Kazuha would use Touka if I didn't have Kuki And a Xiphos Moonlight.  Touka is too beautiful on Kuki, and Xiphos just looks right on him somehow.
                Xiphos passive has way more use on him too as he frequently plays with energy-hungry teams
                    Well, he is quite energy hungry himself at c0 so it fits him perfectly
            [removed]
            Any Gintama fan would find it funny to see a samurai use an Amanto weapon.
            Black Iron Sword isn't her best weapon, but it looks really good on Kuki
        Same, it works quite well!
        I’m so pissed I missed this event (was taking a break). Now my Kazuha is stuck with his story quest weapon
    Same!
        Same
            Same
    I use mine on Alhaitham since his sig avoided me like the plague and I didn't have an iron sting for him at the time. I do now but I'm almost too attached to my umbrella to give it up lol
        I do too! I think it works rather well with him.
        My Alhaitham has the umbrella too and it works amazing tbh
        [removed]
        Same and it physically hurts me how bad it looks on him lol
    Same
    If you got the new HP sword, she loves it even more. Especially if yours does the job of healing.
        Only works on second rotation though, so I'll keep my Kaj-nisut
            Khaj just is better as a whole because the team buffs are much superior.
                True but not everyone pulls on weapon banner. New sword is good if you don't have Khaj.
                    New sword is also a weapon banner exclusive weapon. And is a 4*, which is arguably harder to confirm. 🤨
                        Forgot about that part. Equally true. Somehow I decided to get it for my guaranteed Furina (in case I fail to get signature), and got it on my 13th single pull on weapon banner. Got another Favonius in between, so it was good pull.
                            Fav sword is the hardest weapon for me to get. I swear. I had one at R5, but I lost it. Might have "accidentally" fed it to something when I was high. 🤒🤒

But getting the sword on your 13th pull is crazy lucky. It took me 30 or 40 lmao.
                                Yeah. I had 50 pulls saved & ready to waste 30 of them before I hit soft pity on weapon banner (right now at 40 something). I have all my Favonius weapons (claymore, sword, catalyst & bow) at R4. They kind of come in rotation from standard banner & occasional weapon banner pulls (I do at least a 10 pull per patch on weapon banner).
                                    I've noticed that a big reason I don't get many Fav swords is cuz the weapon banners it usually pops up in, I have no interest in. 😒😒
                            Just an FYI, unless her signature is buffed in beta it is pretty bad. You're better of using Festering Desire (if you have it) or PJC. It really isn't worth pulling for her Sword atm.

Unless you just want it for the aesthetics.
                                The whole reason I pulled on the current banner was this one. The leaks pointed out that signature is bad & so rather than getting a bad 5* later, I tried to get a good 4* now.
                        Decided to try to snag it avoiding the 5* and got 2 of this new HP% sword on my 2nd 10-pull. My Furina and my Kirara will be eating well
        yeah, probably a Dockhand Assistant would be BIS on her not only with HP substats, she will get an elemental and energy after consuming the stack.
            Sounds good. That way I can keep Xiphos for Kazuha and Khaj for Nilou.
            Better than Key and Freedom Sworn? I got R2 from this banner, but not sure what to make of it yet. My Shinobu and Layala run with Freedom Sworn and Key of Khaj Nisut respectively.
                man, DHA is nothing compared to the utility of your 5-star weapon. Since I don't have any premium weapon, I'm using DHA and considered as BIS for my Kuki since she can support my Neuvi for buffing his EM and act as little battery.
    Saaame
    Not only do the colors go well with Kuki, but also the goofy face of the umbrella probably reminds Kuki of Itto which can trigger her to start whacking things harder than before.
    I gave the umbrella weapon to Alhaitham over Iron Sting for the sole reason that it looks funny on him
    Honestly very sad I was on a break during that. I've gotten every event weapon since dodoco tales aside from that one
    Umbrella got the drip but it's strictly worse than Xiphos
    As soon as I got Touka, onto Kuki it went.  It will never leave her.  It is too perfect for her Aesthetically.
    I did put this on Kuki as well
    Same. And Lynette likes it too, but Kuki likes it more.
New players realizing they'll never be able to get albedo's weapon  cinnabar spindle 🥲
    The problem is that Cinnabar is the only 4* sword that scales with DEF%, and it's also his Signature weapons. And for some reasons is not obtainable during the weapon banner alongside with Albedo's one. 

Just why? Make it a pullable sword at least, pls Hoyo!
        And it’s also the weapon they use in his trial. Like they literally let you try him with a weapon a new player will never possibly obtain!
            Exactly this.  Whenever I see people argue that event weapons should stay limited, I always bring up Cinnabar Spindle.  There's no good reason why they would make Cinnabar Spindle a limited weapon you can never get again, and then give it to Albedo in trials.

I still consider myself to be *insanely* lucky that I started playing Genshin when I did.  I started playing in late 2.2, just before pre-install for 2.3 and just in time to pick up Aloy late.

That event was my first event, and I was thankfully able to get both Cinnabar Spindle and R5 it...even though that poor sword has to live with the trauma of my very, very dumb self planning to run it on Xingqiu cause I had zero idea what I was doing back then (plan was abandoned as swiftly as the character).  It's with Albedo now, so it's being properly being taken care of, as it should be.
                > Whenever I see people argue that event weapons should stay limited

It's such a stupid decision. I have friends that refuse to ever return to the game because of that bs. There's a point where the FOMO keeps players from returning rather than retaining them. 

At the very least (if they cared about player retention), they should have time limited runs where the weapon returns. 

If they were kinder, they would have the weapons become purchasable in the shops and stuff after a certain amount of time (but that's just wishful thinking.
                    See that just makes sense to make them purchasable blueprints or something. As much as they do right, exclusive weapons, story quests, and whole areas/maps are just not fun. Just take a year to return it, you get the same experience of some degree of exclusivity without being permanently unable to get Dodoco Tales just bc you discovered Genshin after it was released :(
            That is one of the biggest reasons I keep feedbacking Hoyo as to why I'll never care for Albedo and Fischl and pull/play for them. They've locked their content (weapon and/or stories) behind the past so I'll never experience it. Why would I care about someone who's best build (or equivalent) is impossible to get especially when to me, they have no story for me? Albedo's worried they'll destroy Mondstadt one day? He's just a weirdo. Why would I care about this one weird girl who pretends to be friends with us the day we met her while playing TCG? Fischl is a schizophrenic girl in my eye. Hoyo please bring access to their story and/or weapon back you're literally losing money now without them.

Atleast they learned their lesson in Sumeru with Kaveh and let you know his backstory (albeit in a condensed version) in his hangout quest too besides the limited event.
                [deleted]
                    > They've locked their content (weapon and**/or stories)**
                        Okay, but the sentence immediately after that one makes it pretty clear that they think it's an optimal weapon for her
                            no it doesnt? what sentence are u talking about 😭
                    Yep. Fischl is perfectly fine using Stringless or even a worse bow.

Albedo was using Harbinger of Dawn for a YEAR and doing pretty great without his even better sword.
                Isn’t fischl’s weapon on banner rn? Or did she have another one?
                    Tbh Mitternacht Waltz isn’t even her best 4* weapon. It’s decent for on-field physical Fischl, but for any other Fischl build you’d much rather run Stringless.

Of course if you want to talk true bis weapon it’s Polar Star.
                        Meanwhile I run her with Alley Hunter (her BIS off-field DPS), which also meshes perfectly with her alt outfit.
                        Surely stringless is, at least for aggravate teams?
                            Stringless is definitely her best 4 star in aggravate.
                    They meant her story which was a limited time event.
                        Are they referring to the 2.8 GAA Fischl story?
                            Probably 1.1 Unreconciled Stars (Scaramouche was also introduced there, and it's where Fischl and Mona first became friends). But Fischl's mind palace story has the same issue.
                                Ooohh I’ll have to YouTube then lmao
                    Fischls weapon is Alley Hunter wdym
                I don't get why they don't rerun events. It's extra content for (almost) no effort.
                    Apparently HSR allows you to play certain older events from a menu after they're done running. So they definitely know it's something players want.
                        I think just the ones rhat unlock new areas, though (at least so far).  Genshin just doesn't have nee area events be limited time at all.
                            Golden Apple Archipelago and the Veluriyam Mirage which were designed to be specifically limited. (There was also a separate Enkanomiya for the Bokosu Box due to slightly altered environments and event mechanics despite being the same map that the user can swap between the original and the event version.)
                                Yes, absolutely.  (I've been playing since 2.0 so I played all that except gaa ).  But those were temporary locations, not permanent map spots with quests wired up to thm,, like the museum and market.

Genshin has locationa that open uo with non-archon quests too -- ekanomia, chasm, dragonspine,  But the quests involved are officially permanent, woth the extra event quest/rewards associated taked on (and including story that's l9st after the event ends).  HSR still has the extra rewards, but the story for the location quest ends up all inside the premanent event, not half and half. (the ekanomia event location is a weird outlier there).
                Fischl’s weapon is literally on the banner right now (and it’s useless of her anyways).
                    Stringless is best for her, right?
                        Yeah for aggravate it's good, still think any crit 5 star bow is better though
                        Not necessarily since she has a lot of good options but it's pretty good on her.
                        For Aggravate it’s her best 4*, generic Crit bows are better for Taser or other teams.
                            I see. I guess my perspective was skewed since I play her with Keqing.
                            Doesn't she also really like Alley Hunter?
                                Alley hunter is technically better, though the difference is small in aggravate teams.

People just suggest stringless more frequently because it's on banners more and more more likely you have refines on it.
                    I guess you never heard about physical fischl
                        Yeah but she wants Rust.
                Trust in N. I really hope she appears in person in the future so that we can go back and play lost events, and/or buy weapons supposedly lost to new players. Klee's signature Dodoco Tales is also event-locked, IIRC.
                They need to add event quests to a playable archive. I don't care about the primos or mora or rewards, obviously those would be limited. They made the game so heavily centered around story and lore, and then just make some of their best content evaporate after a few weeks.

I mean jeezus, you can't even play through permanent quests again and get the full experience of the story, see the cutscenes, or even see the characters interacting visually while they give their lines. (I'd love to be able to re-play world quests again too, like the quest line with Jeht was so good). They're not afraid of re-played content in general, the weekly bosses are a major event we re-experience and somehow that didn't ruin the game.

(Side gripe I wish they'd make character gameplay trials permanent in the character archive. I mean you DO want me to spend several months jonesing for a 5-star, right? How would I care if I've never played them and don't remember the 4 seconds of play from their story quest I completed 7 months ago and can never re-play? Also side side gripe why can we view characters we don't own in the character archive--which is a good thing--but can't view weapons we don't own in the weapon archive? It's such a basic thing to make known what weapons exist in the game so you can plan your account.)
                Yikes
                This is such weird logic to me, I can agree having Albedo's weapon locked behind FOMO is stupid af but if you're curious enough about the characters why not just go on YT and watch some playthroughs of the events they were relevant in? It sucks you have to resort to watching old content on YT but at least you have that available to you, if you're going to tell me you don't want to do that (my words, not yours) JUST because you have to goto YT to watch past stuff that's on you but you can't entirely complain you don't have access to any story or background for them.

This reply is also longer than I even intended for it to be or else i'd actually tell you why you're wrong about Albedo and Fischl but you're entitled to your own opinion on a character but it's weird to me to just dismiss them if you won't even attempt to look anything up about their character (if you even care to) instead of just complaining about it.
                    roast their ass hell yeah
            Albedo has been gone for 1 year so far. Been waiting for him since 3.1 . Hoyo is just trolling with everything regarding that character
                Hasn’t *quite* been a year yet (5 days until it is… same amount of time since the last limited 5 star waifu was released…)

I don’t know why Hoyoverse is so insistent on making Mond characters wait a long time for reruns.
        Personally, I'm of the opinion that they should put event four-star weapons in the starglitter shop like the Royal and Blackcliff weapons, and have them at 24 starglitter like the rest.
            Why they dont do that yet is beyond me
                FOMO. If there are weapons you'll never gain access to in game if you don't play, then you will always play so you don't miss out. If they make it available in any other format, the strategy isn't effective.
                    Having to check back in each month or two and pull for more glitter locks people in to keep playing, and is still a huge incentive to actually be there for the event to skip all that.
        Same with dodoco tales being the real signature for Klee. Plus festering desire being actually good on a few characters.
        they could just add it to the mondstadt fishing vendor if nothing else
    Festring desires is same.
        Yeah but festering is no one's bis compared to cinnabar.So if u don't have festering,its not that big of a loss compared to not having cinnabar
            Festering is going to be F2P BiS for Furina.
                Isn't pipe better?
                    No
                        Ah, you're right. I'll better give Festering Desire to her and leave the pipe for DMC.
            yeah well festering desires bis character isn't out yet so...
                She will be out next patch i meant bis 4star
                I doubt it will be her BiS, they will prob tweak the beta stats on the new weapon

What is this copium downvotes, you really think festering desire will be better than the gacha weapon? Are you dumb?
                    It's BiS aside from her signature.

The signature is still best, but Festering Desire is significantly above every other option, even other 5 star weapons.
            Festering is a really good F2P on a lot of characters, and is Furina's BIS 4*. Lmao. The slander is real. Also, Festering is better than every weapon OP posted. 💀
                You're not getting my point,first of all furina's kit isn't finalized yet so her 4 star bis can change and u yourself said that it's good(not the best) on a lot of characters but cinnabar is bis so missing cinnabar is a bigger loss than festering unless u never plan on pulling albedo
                    It's not going to change that drastically. Festering _will_ be the BIS 4* on Furina. 😅
                        The best part is it will not only be her 4star bis but might as well be overall 2nd bis wep or... Even the 1st bis itself over her Sig(depending cases/situation)
                            With characters like Furina and Yelan, I just typically prefer ER weapons. It's easy to gain plenty of HP in substats, but ER is always harder to get.
                        She's an archon so we never know.Also still festering isn't bis for furina,her 5 star weapon will be her real bis.Meanwhile for albedo,cinnabar is his bis even compared to other 5 stars
                            Lmao. Nobody else in beta ever had their beta best in slot options change completely. So, there's that. And, sure, her 5* will be really good. But Furina is also still one of the most energy hungry characters in the game, who also has a skill that doesn't produce many particles through the duration, which is why ER weapons like Fav and Festering will likely just be easier, and better, to use in practice. Part of why Baizhu's weapon, while technically being his BIS, is so fucking mid. Favonius Codex is just better in actual gameplay. Kind of similar to Yelan, too. Sure, Aqua is good, but ER weapons are so much better.
                                ER is not the reason why Baizhu’s weapon isn’t worth it (it’s not even “just mid” in him since it is literally his BiS).

Jadefall’s passive at R1 *actually restores more energy and heals more than R5 Prototype Amber for Baizhu because of the way the passive works*. R5 PAmber gives 18 energy in one burst, R1 Jadefall gives 22.5 energy in one burst. In practice and on paper, no weapon is better than Jadefall on Baizhu specifically, unless you want to battery the team (then you use Favonius but even then Jadefall is still better for Baizhu’s personal energy gain).

Jadefall is literally a better PAmber on Baizhu; no arguments whatsoever because it’s literally the same passive and stats but higher.

You can’t really say Fav is better in this case since that’s a team dependent thing instead of being a Baizhu dependent thing; if the rest of your team has no energy issues then Jadefall is still best.

The real reason Jadefall is “mid” in general is that it’s *ONLY* BiS for Baizhu. Nobody else gets good mileage out of it.
                                    Fav is just better lmao.
                                Still my point stands that her bis is her 5 star weapon.
                                    If you have over 200% ER on her without an ER weapon, sure! But you probably won't have 40k HP. 😅 Her weapon is one of the biggest baits for whales/simps that I've ever seen.
                            Honestly Festering is looking stronger than her Sig rn

Sure unless further changes turn tides that's not in our hands,but as of now Festering is in the favor
                            I mean, of course Furina's BiS will be her signature weapon. Albedo's 5* signature doesn't even exist.


If you made it so Furina's 5* sig also didn't exist, then that means (at her current stats in double Hydro), Festering IS her BiS.


Hoyo can still release Albedo's sig just like they did with Venti's though/copium
                        Isnt the new battle pass sword better at R5? Gives the same damage percent ( 32) and gives 4 more crit rate and has crit rate substat. Oh and it buffs burst as well. Its not f2p though
                            Maybe, but the sword is third on my list of new Battle Pass weapons to get to R5. First is the Spear, then the Jade, and then the sword. My EM Raiden wants that 240 EM.
            >!its very good for furina only 20% worse than her own 5 star weapon!<
                >!I'd say it's better than her sig if she's a solo hydro!<
            Very understandable, we don't have hp sword too which is a bummer, hoyo fear nilou.
                Check current weapon banner.
                    Event/fishing weapons.
            Sadly, but Festering is no one’s bis only in current version.
    Cinnabar Spindle is half the reason imma pull for Albedo sooner or later. Have always loved everything about him but never had a reason to pull until I got Cinnabar
        I mean, yeah! I have a decent artefact set and Cinnabar ready for him, but he's nowhere to be seen.
    Honestly, doesn't beat new and a lot of semi-old players realizing they'll never get Festering Desire, Furina's 4 star BiS
        Eh I mean I think fleuve cendre is decent as well and favonious sword is also as good imo as she has er problems as far as im aware
            Fav is always good but fleuve is literally festering desire cope, I think it's strictly worse
            Fleuve is copium
    I wish they added the event weapons to Paimon's Shop. Let us buy them with Starglitter at least.
    They should update the starglitter shop and put it there with it's refinement materials.
    I’ve got that but no Albedo! None else uses it
    At least Harbinger is still solid on him
    I hate stuff like that, its just plain stupid. Its not even about collecting stuff, its about actual gameplay
Metal pipe ftw
Op is talking about how goofy and funny these weapons look and people are complaining the stats are shit.


Truly a genshin experience.
    your telling me a pipe or a frozen fish are not the strongest weapons in the game? Time to file several complaints until every meta player is forced to use them!!
    Stats shit? If people on this sub, full of 2-3 year old veterans, knew that tons of casual players are using these weapons because they are F2P and these weapons are quite good because Genshin does not require the best stuff to have a great time.
I literally cant obtain half of these
I use that umbrella on kazuha I love it so much
use kaveh, put the luxurious sea lord on him and use your charge attack

its hilarious how it looks
    I always end up thinking of this. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=T8XeDvKqI4E
    Kaveh is the only 4 star I don't have
Ever since the pipe got added, my immediate thought was "Welcome to Silent Hill" lol.
Hitting people with a rusty pipe is peak gameplay, no matter the game
the crackpipe is really underrated the ER it gives on r5 is so insane
Kinda cheating to use event weapons for this list. Obviously there will be people who can't appreciate them because they don't even have them.
    I get that. I love festering desire's design. I want it, but my desire will be left... festering... but agreed. Event weapons should be sold at the specialty shops you spend sigils at, even if it costs primos.
I only started playing this year and missed the fish claymore and the umbrella so, even if someone recommended it to me, I can not test it for myself (ever). In turn, if someone else asked me for advice, I would recommend different weapons I have access to.
I love the pipe "sword". It makes me want to join the revolutionary army and obtain fire powers.
I love how angry my Alhaitham looks holding the umbrella lol. I like to think Kaveh got it for him as a gift and he uses it just to be spiteful ahaha
God I wish we could play old events for reduced rewards. I want the funny fish so bad
Wdym umbrella doesnt get attention? Its literally the only weapon that has a moving eye on it besides the fact its a literal umbrella and its amazing on Kuki but even cooler on Kazuha cuz colors matching.


Also, pipe is kinda meh for old players cuz Festering desire is just better.
    You only get one festering desire. I personally think the pipe was supposed to be a post 1.2 festering desire. Not a day goes by where I wish they'd put them somewhere in game, maybe add an event shop or banner for Weapons and Aloy
    For many people the umbrella and the other event weapons don’t exist. I know I was pissed to find out I can never get it, cuz I would love a yokai sword.
        Im an 1.0 player and for a long time I didnt wanted newer players to get these weapons but after some time (and also cuz I started playing Arknights and missing a collab unit forever) I changed my mind, hoyo is just cringe with Genshin, Honkai impact that is older has a special shop for these types of items.

But then again, that game also has artifact loadouts and some skill effects can be turned off(like we want for constellations), Genshin devs either dont habe time to add more QoLs or just dont care.
            I think Genshin is the samsara spin-off of Impact that got more popular than they expected and so doesn’t get the same resources, sadly. :/ I could be wrong, but considering the differences between Genshin and both Honkai games, it’s the impression I get.
                Bruh, its simple; Genshin gets the money, Honkai gets the love.
For Sabo from One Piec
well i've been advocating how good this fishing weapon is before it even came out, considering it's totally f2p even. Look at them stats, its so good for building a well balanced character tbh. so good.

oh, wait a minute..  we are just discussing about it's aethetics?

*^(Radiant-Yam-1285 has left the chat)*
    Get yo ass back in the chat. This is even more of a win for this weapon that it looks goofy/funny AND has decent stats
love silly weapons, also in Soul calibur and Monster hunter.

i know most people rate quality on weather or not one can pet a dog in the game. but i say if there is fishing or any mini-games within the main game, thats quality fo sho.
    Monster hunter world. My character wears a cat mask and has floppy dual sword fish. When I enter demon mode, the eyes go from blue to red. It's like they go into a blind rage.
i love the stupid fish claymore, wish i could've gotten it Q AQ/ it looks absolutely ridiculous and it's perfect lmao
Gonna be real honest, I've been with that fucking tuna on my Eula for so long without any improvement in sight, I can't stand the sight of that weapon anymore. The umbrella though, looks really nice on Kazuha and also far from terrible on Kuki.
SO we have the Kneecap Breaker, Fish slapper and pointy umbrella?
How about a joke weapon of a broom that could be used as a Polearm, Claymore or a Sword?
    I can imagine xiao slaying literal demons with a broom 💀
Trust me flueve cendre ferryman will have a lot of praise once furina is out
That bow is garbage, the other weapons are really useful.
    Not if you don't care and just want er, im running the fish bow on my c6 faruzan and she running very well.
        Sure, but Favonious Bow exist and everyone get that one for free plus it has a better passive, but you can use the fish as well if you want.
            >but Favonious Bow exist and everyone get that one for free plus

You get 1 Fav bow for free.

There's quite a few Bow Users in the game who want an ER bow.

If You're not a long time player, then you probably don't have heaps of sacs/favs to spare.      
Even then, being a long time player doesn't prevent you from getting screwed by RNG (I've been playing since 1.2 and I have 1 singular R3 Fav bow, bruh.
                Me with my ONE crescent pike, playing since sept 2021.
                    Crescent pike is a craftable Weapon thought.

You also get at least one guaranteed billet of each weapon type per Nation
                        Not gonna lie, I prioritized the dragon spine spear because I’m vain and wanted rosaria to be a e s t h e t I c
                I’ve been playing since 1.3 and I’ve only gotten one Stringless. Plenty of Bells though lol.
            People usually dont have bucket loads of sac and fav weapons, some cant be bothered to swap everytime, so i think some of teh lesser weapons are useable and comes with the bonus of looking cool/ridicoulus ;)
What makes End of the Line worth using, tho?
    I personally don't care if it's worth using. To be honest, I don't even have it yet. I just think it looks neat, probably the worse in design and gameplay out of the 3.
        I mean... all it had to be was a bow version of Lux Sealord and it would've been great.
    It's a guaranteed ER% Weapon.

Even if the passive is dead, it's still useful if you have a support who needs ER and you can't spare a sac/fav (either because they're occupied or because rng hates you)
    Faruzan can kinda use it... but yeah, just use a Favonius Warbow instead.
Im not a big fan of the "goofy" aesthetic myself but too each his own I guess.
Literally everyone talks about how wild the designs are..... seems you can just say "x thing is slept on!!!!" and everybody automatically agrees
I love the big giant fish on my tiny little Sayu
Furina using a metal pipe as a weapon is just so funny to me I might just do it. I'm hearing it's not that bad on her so I'm extra excited lol.
Dont like "joke" weapons
    Agree, I'd rather have Eula's F2P BiS to be a good looking sword rather than this stupid fish. I'm never using it unless we'll get a transmog feature.
Event exclusive weapons will never get praised because Mihoyo is a greedy company that will never rerun past events so if you feel burnt out and you skip an event, that weapon is lost forever.
    When I got back into playing it was during the Festering Desire event. I kid you not. I looked the weapon in the eye, thought "oh cool, you get free weapons for playing through the story" then proceeded to ignore the event thinking I could do later.

I have since vowed to never skip an event. No matter how small or irrelevant it seems.
    I don't understand why they're not added to the Souvenir vendor or something like the gadgets.
    Agreed. They could have reused the event (like literally rerun the quests) and slapped a new weapon to farm but nope.
    I agree with you 100%. That's also the reason why I believe Albedo, as a new player, is the most insignificant character in the game. His BiS weapon? locked behind an event. His story? 90% of it locked behind events hoyo said they'll never rerun. Albedo, at this point, is nothing but a character with no story.
I think most people agree that their designs are really cool, it’s just such a shame they aren’t that good. The Umbrella does have some use cases (being an EM sword that’s generally better than Iron Sting) but past that Luxurious Sea-Lord is basically only good on Beidou. End of the Line is basically garbage tier and Fleuve is just a discount Fav, which is just always worse than Fav. (And yes, a new sword wielding 5 star characters whose damage comes from skill *may* be released, but even then this would still have to compete with Fav on them if their ER requirement was too high.)
End of the Line I got it for pure collection but it is super trash, definitely the worst free 4* weapon they have ever released. 
And it fact, it will be the only one to stay at level 1 forever probably.

I still need to get the new pipe weapon. I guess I will work on in after the Archon story so be once with the next patch.
    >definitely the worst free 4* weapon they have ever released.

End of the Line is an ER% weapon. Meaning it still has decent value as a simple *guaranteed* stat stick.

Not every player has a dozen max refined Sacs/favs and not everyone bothers with swapping weapons.

The worst free 4 star weapon is the Fontaine craftable polearm. Outclassed in every way it could be used in and not even valuable as a stat stick.
End of the line doesnt get attention for a reason
    Yea... both design and gameplay wise it's unremarkable. But still childe's autos look goofy with it
Many ogs got festring desires which is basically the same but with better stats, currently my layla hold this sword, im waiting patiently to give it to furina.
The fish is too cringe for me.
    christ
    Fish bow and fish claymore substas are cringe
        Fish bow is just worse fav bow which you already get for free so fair but the claymore isn't completely terrible. It's essentially a more burst oriented prototype archaic which while nothing special it can be decentish for the f2p players that got it. Attack% while dendro reactions generally make it less useful, it's not that bad of a stat to have. Bigger thing is more so claymore characters arguably being the weakest weapon type in terms of the units.
            Fav bow is just so contested.. half the bow users want one, lol. I gave the Fish bow to Faruzan. It's alright. And there's also the Twilight something bow that was an event reward.. i gave that to Yelan. Works decently enough as well. I'm not playing the numbers game so whether it's 2% better or worse, i don't care. If the sub stat is right i can dig it.
                It's a lot more than just 2% worse to fav lol. Fav naturally has more er for the substat but the passive further reduces er requirements for the entire team. Meanwhile the passive for the fish bow is near useless. 

Fading twilight on Yelan really isn't great even if you aren't able to give Yelan fav for whatever reason, 3 star bows like recurve bow or slingshot are both better and if you need the er you just run er sands. High refine stringless/mouuns moon can be viable and technically don't even need to be levelled to be used. 

Also there is sac bow which depending on the team and refine can get you an extra skill use every rotation which is quite good. 

The actual niche for getting the fish bow especially having to grind for it with fishing is just so small. You are better off just keeping extra copies of fav bow without refining if you need that many of them.
                    The catch is the only fishing weapon were getting it is an actual grind.

Both the fish bow and the pipe have absolutely trivial fish costs.
End of the Line I got it for pure collection but it is super trash, definitely the worst free 4* weapon they have ever released.

I still need to get the new pipe weapon. I guess I will work on in after the Archon story so be once with the next patch.
fish bow's kinda meh. other than it looking funny, who's it even good for?
    If you need ER% and don't have w sac or fav to spare
Not everyone likes goofy designs like this, and their bad passives aren't helping either.
Toukabou Shigure is just Pallysol from YoKai Watch 2
because there are craftable and event weapons that are better.
Because they have nothing special. They are F2P to help new players that don't have enough options. All of those weapons are replaceable by craftable weapons, or simply don't synergize so well with the characters we currently have, that's why they don't get enough praise. 

Plus, event weapons usually aren't recommended in guides because people who didn't get them can't get anymore. The only event weapon I see being recommended is Cinnabar Spindle, because that absolutely BiS for Albedo.
They're all pretty mid gameplay-wise. The umbrella is only good, because the only actual good EM 4* alternative is a gacha weapon - Xiphos'.
    Not really, there's Iron Sting that has the exact same stats, only a different passive, and it's craftable.
        Iron Sting and the Umbrella are only used as EM stat sticks lmao. Their passives don't do jack shit on the characters using them. 😅 Xiphos' actually has a passive used in combat, and is arguably better on Kazuha than Freedom-Sworn.
            Just saying cause you wrote that the only good alternative to umbrella is Xiphos. It's not, Iron Sting is on par with umbrella. Xiphos is for sure the only one with a useful passive tho.
                I said _actual_ good. Iron Sting is one of the most mid weapons in the game, and was only ever used due to being the only EM sword, other than Freedom-Sworn, for almost 2 years. Iron Sting is passable at best. If we had other EM swords as alternatives, nobody would use it.
            Alhaitham can use both the EM substat and the passive of those two weapons well. They are his top F2P 4-star options. Same for Keqing aggravate.
                I mean. Most event 4* and craftable are a character's BIS "F2P" option because F2P players always have mid options available to them. 🤭 neither weapon are in the top3 best 4* weapons as a whole.
                    For those characters, they are, actually. I only said F2P to exclude Wolf-Fang.
            >Iron Sting and the Umbrella are only used as EM stat sticks lmao. Their passives don't do jack shit on the characters using them.

Aggravate Keqing and Spread Al haitham
                Alhaitham would rather have Xiphos' there. Even the new BP sword blows both Umbrella and ISting out of the water. They're still only EM stat sticks in both cases.
                    Irrelevant to the point that is being refuted.
                        Not really. They're still only being used as EM statsticks.
                            Except they're not just EM stat sticks.

Iron sting

> Dealing Elemental DMG increases all DMG by 6%-12% for 6s. Max 2 stacks. Can only occur once every 1s.

Toukabou Shigure

> After an attack hits opponents, it will inflict an instance of Cursed Parasol upon one of them for 10s. This effect can be triggered once every 15s. If this opponent is defeated during Cursed Parasol's duration, Cursed Parasol's CD will be refreshed immediately. The character wielding this weapon will deal 16-32% more DMG to the opponent affected by Cursed Parasol.

Both weapons provide a DMG bonus buff to the user.

Since both Keqing and Al haitham are Talent multiplier based DPS, they actually can make use of DMG bonuses, thus both characters actually fully utilize the weapon passive.
                                They're pretty much just EM statsticks.
                                    No way in hell you actually read and acknowledged the information presented in my reply.
ER weapons get overshadowed by Favonius series, and where it comes to damage focused Claymores, it's hard to compete with serpent spine.

The one I agree doesn't get much attention (but which I don't see many people "underrating") is the umbrella. It's very close in performance to the Iron Sting (even surpassing in some scenarios), but it didn't cost any prototypes. It also looks really cool on Kuki.
I still don't have any fishing weapons haha 😂 too lazy to fish...
I'm so sad that I will never obtain event weapons like Festering Desire (Furina), Fading Twilight (Sara), Windspear (Cyno) or Cinnabar Spindle (Albedo) just because I haven't playing the game back then :(
I use that umbrella sword on Nilou and I don’t know why I don’t want to change it
    If I had her, I'd use it on her too. I don't think I'd feel right handing her a sword when I can imagine her incorporating an umbrella into her dances.
Ugh where can i get this weapons?
    Unfortunately the fish claymore and umbrella sword were event weapons and are no longer obtainable. 

The pipe sword is from fontaine's fishing association and the fish bow is from sumeru's fishing association

Inazuma fishing association also has "The Catch" an er polearm that increase burst dmg and burst crit rate.
        I have the catch got it back when it first came out  umbrella sword looks really good hope they sell it in the jewellery shop there 3 jewellery shop that are totally useless have nothing to sell
            Which shops? If you can't buy from them it means you haven't maxed out that region's sigil tree yet.
Inazuma has the Sakura tree at the shrine, Sumeru's is locked behind the aranara quest and fontaine's is the fountain  in front of the opera house. Once those are maxed out, then you can buy from that region's shop.
                Ohh I haven't sumeru tree and fountain  not planing to max them same with the status of the 7  

I would level the status if they give stamina or 5star weapon  but the current reward worthless to me
What does "%16 extra ER for 5s after casting skill" do though? Does it also increase the ammount of particules you got in the first skill that casted the effect or does it only increase the ones that happens during the next 5 seconds?


İf its the second one its somewhat useless
    It increase the weilder's er for 5 seconds after using a skill so any particules/energy obtained in those 5 second are increased also this is r1 (at r5 it's 32% er) with the substate it's grand total of 77.9 er
> golden apple for a catalyst

Ringo-chan, kyou mo yoroshiku ne!
Kinda off topic, but who would the fish bow & the pipe sword be good for? I can’t think of anyone currently.
    I use the pipe sword for lynette. while I could use sac sword or favonius sword for team er, my team already has pretty good er so the personal er the pipe gives lynette is pretty good. plus it looks funny
    The pipe can be used on lynette and benette ( if you have no better base atk options) and supposedly was made for Furina, coming in 4.2

The bow is actually trash and isn't better than any other Ftp option for any character. If you absolutely, must use it then Fishel might work with it, there's just a plethora of better bows.
    They're both ER stat sticks.

The pipe sword is Useful on any character who needs a lot of ER and produces energy particles on the initial skill use (Lynette/dendro mc/Xingqiu for example)

The bow is just so so. Useful if you can't spare a sac or fav
Bow seems kinda mid tbh

Umbrella is good but Iron sting exists already and only few characters use them.

Shark is good for Diluc, Eula and Beidou

Pipe is great
Fish(fiş)
my Keqing loves her Electro infused umbrella, and I also plan to equipped my future Hydro archon with a pipe too.
ahh, i remember the days that claymore fish was leaked and literally no one believed it
Sigh...  A shame Lyney isn't a sword user or blue.
    I dream of the day lynette becomes a red bow user. Such a sad world.
My Kirara has the Umbrella, but I don't have the other 3. Although I think I have some enhancement material for the fish claymore (some yellow stuff in a bottle) - must have been from an event that was running when I had just started playing.
Can I still get the metal pipe? Or was it an event weapon too?
    Fontaine fishermen.  
Those weps like The Catch are permanent.
        So there's a catch to it
    You can still fish for it. Fishing weapons do not end like event weapons.
        I knew something smelt fishy Didn't even it was a fishing weapon, thx for letting me know.
this is where id talk about the fish


IF I HAD ONE
Did ‘The Bell’ actually become useful in Fontaine I have it at like R5
    No. Looks cool, though.
        Hopefully when the Hydro Claymore user comes it’ll be useable
Mostly because they’re all a bitch to obtain
I haven't fish enough for the bow but the rest i use them a lot excep for the pipe i didn't get it yet 🤣
what characters are the metal pipe and umbrella good for? i wanna use them but i’m bad at building characters lol
    Pipe works on Lynette, Hydro MC, maybe in the future with Furina.  
Umbrella works *and* is stylish on Kuki and Kazuha.
    Umbrella is for Kuki and Kazuha. Fleuve is for any burst-using support who does not have access to Favonius sword.
I gave the kasa to Kazuha because the sword from his Story Quest is stated to not be a good enough match compared to other available swords out there. I did think of giving the pipe to Lynette (for reasons concerning how she's that vehemently emotionless that she's compared to a robot), and once gave the tuna to Diluc until I got a Wolf's Gravestone refined for me.
I'm thinking about farming for that pipe for Clorinde, it would be comical lol.
I like using the Youkai sword for the Youkai cat.
Design alone is not enough for me to spend my resins on. They have to be useful, that's why I leveled the umbrella for Alhaitham, Kazuha and Kuki.
I wish there was a shop for the event limited ones 😔 I would legit pay primos for some of them i don’t care how "bad" they are I want to hit people with fish
And I have them all, except the best but I'm working on that
I'm quite satisfied with Festering Desire tbh.
I’m just tired of fishing.
How to get no 2 & 3?
1. Rng
2. Fomo
3. Fomo
4. Fish
The Fleuve Cendre Ferryman looks like the weapon of Sabo from One Piece lol. And Tokabou Shigure is very good too. That’s the weapon for my Kuki.
End of the line is ass gameplay wise but it reminds me of the defect swordfish bow I’ve used a ton in Monster Hunter Freedom Unite lmao
Salty tuna, my fave! ❤️
you should play guilty gear, where the characters beat each other up with among others: a giant lighter, a pool queue, a bed, yo-yo's, a folding fan, their own shadow and a coffin with an alien in it.
i am endlessly disappointed that the one time i took a break from genshin, i missed out on luxurious sea lord
I love how there's all of these gorgeous swords and then we can slap people with a fish or beat them with a lead pipe.
As a Kuki main, umbrella looks amazing on her

I would have used it on Kazu, but he has Xyphos
My furina will enjoy her copper pipe
Cool designs, meh to okay/good weapons. Too bad we can't use them as skins for other weapons.
I adore the umbrella yokai. Using it on Kazuha makes me imagine a story about a chill ronin wandering with his rude parasol.
My Beidou loves her giant tuna. That was my first event-limited weapon and I will never forget how happy I was to get it.
Isn't the pipe gonna be good for Furina?
    It might be her best in slot, but it's contending with favonius
        I see. What would you say is better for her, fav, this thing or the new BP sword?
            I'd say battle pass sword, but it depends on your artifacts. If your sitting pretty at 70 crit rate and good crit dmg then use the pipe or fav for the extra er.

An r1 bp sword grants 16% dmg and 35% crit rate to your skill and burst.

An r5 fav offers offers 61% er and a universal elemental particule on crit (must be on-feild)

An r5 pipe offers 16% skill crit rate, 45.9% er which increases to 77.9% for 5 seconds after a skill. (45.9% substat + 35% from passive)

If your heavily struggling with crit bp weapon, no crit problems the fav, just shy of the crit goal then pipe
After a year of crit kazuha the umbrella made his EM build greatconsidering i felt to lazy to farm for the sword materials for ironsting xD
What about nahidas weapon!? I love that she can channel magic from a gravy boat lmao
I use that parsol with Benny! I love the idea that he uses a cursed sword and doesn't notice because of his own bad luck.
I don't like these weapons. They look stupid. But I do use the umbrella because I don't have enough em swords. Also isn't the lead pipe an easter egg for nier automata?
Imo only the 2 swords are worth. But you could also get their counterparts in festering and that craftable
I love the Sea-Lord’s design. Shame I’ll never have it.
I wish we had a character that really wanted the Sea Lord claymore. Might end up running it on Chongyun
My kuki has the EM sword bro
That looks like a good metal pipe
speak softly and carry a large fish
Who is the bow good for?
Toukabou is the only 4 stars weapon have sound and icon effect like 5 stars weapon
Oh I love it! The kasa-obake is my favorite and matches so well with Kazuha hahaha and the animations are great, really.

The sea lord I initially let it with Diluc (I love to ruin serious looks, "time for retribution" with a enormous fish is amazing) till I got WGS and now it's in Sayu hands (she's cute and gets cuter with a silly weapon), but I'm tempted to give it to Beidou.

The fish bow belongs to Diona, don't care if it's not her best weapon, cat gets the fish, it's the law.

The pipe one is on Lynette hands for now (if one day we get a fish sword Lynette and Kirara will share it) but I need a baguette weapon too, please Hoyo!

What you guys think could be a good design for a non-weapon weapon from Sumeru? We already have books as catalists (we need a physical catalist user to punch someone with the book, like Fugo did with that disgusting teacher in jjba part 5).
"End of the line" is unironically an amazing pun
That Tuna is my Diluc's lifeline. He roasts it on his back and uses it to beat mages 💪
Where are you pulling up the weapon info from? Is it an app?
    I just used the genshin [wiki](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Genshin_Impact_Wiki) fot the images but I'd recommend [project amber](https://ambr.top/en). It shows character kits, weapons, but it also has a setting to turn on and off leaks if your concerned about that too.
I wish the pipe was better because it's a hilarious weapon lmao
    Good for Furina if you don't have Festering Desire.
        Better than Favge for teamwide utility/more funneling for your main DPS?
            If you need the ER, Fav but for more DMG/Crt then Festering/pipe is what the theory crafters are recommending.
I'm gonna be completely honest I think the umbrella just looks dumb, not because it's an umbrella, but because of how damn goofy the face on it looks. 

Like, there's a number of ways they could do a mischievous yokai face on it, but they went with such a lame design imo.
    Yea. I kind of wish it was a plain old umbrella, or had a better looking face. 
It kinda of looks like a snot nosed kid with a missing tooth.
That pipe is, without a doubt, Bennett's best drip weapon!
How do you get the pipe
    Fontaine fishing association
        Thank you!
Now we need a tree trunk claymore
Prank em with the lead pipe
I love the Cinnabar on my first 5* Albedo!
    My albedo is missing about 5% crit rate for me to feel comfortable with his stats. But I'd sooner lose him than take his sword from him.
Is there any way to get that tuna claymore ever again?
    Unfortunately not it was an event ran way back in 2.1. Praying that one day, they add an event shop.
i thought this was an announcement saying that these were coming back and now i’m sad🥲
    I'm sorry for your pain. I feel it too... I looked festering desire in the eye... and forgot to do it's event 😮‍💨
I want one!
    You can still get the pipe from fontaine fishing association, and the bow from sumeru fishing association (tho it's bad unless you have no better options)
        Sweet, thank you. I’ll just rely on my artifacts for damage. Lol.
I use the toukabou with Alhaitham
To be fair, two of them aren't even possible to obtain anymore, no use praising a weapon you don't have when iron sting exists
whats the umbrella sword?
I'm upgrading the Metal Pipe for my Furina
I FORGOT ABOUT THE FISH BOW AHHH SO MUCH FISHING TO DO
None of them are anything special, especially for a long time player who’s picked up other event weapons + some 5*s. I have a LOT of characters and I basically have no reason to ever use any of these
My Lynette is currently using the pipe
Where you get the pipe from
    Fontaine fishing association.
Well besides Fish Claymore they are either power crept on their release already by a craftable or fishable weapon or kinda mid.
The 3rd one is so ugly and I hate it 😭
But I gotta use it on lumine for the EM
I'm a huge fish claymore enthusiast. My Sayu has it even tho I have 2 5stars I could give her

The others are super neat too. Kazuha has the umbrella, Diona has the bow and I'll give Kirara the pipe when I get her. The courier chose violence
I only got the fish claymore. I really want to get the others, but I doubt there will be reruns of those events
Meanwhile I think they have one thing in common: Every one of these weapons is ugly af and instantly ruins every character's drip you put them on (yes, the umbrella too... it may match the colors on characters it's good on like Shinobu, but it just looks so stupid on her, I honestly prefer Iron Sting on her, because of it). "But they're dorky/funny on purpose!" - that argument doesn't help if I absolutely hate how they look on a character.
    Well to each their own, but I think the umbrella works well with Kazuha's wandering samurai trope (I personally prefer a katana on her), and Bennette with nothing but a pipe seems pretty lore-accurate. I think the pipe looks pretty cool and minus the face, the umbrella is neat.
        The pipe may work on someone like Bennett, yeah, but on anyone else? Not really. And I disagree - I think the pipe looks really ugly too. I'll probably (have to) use it on Furina when she comes out, because I don't have Festering Desire (thanks mihoyo for refusing to bring it back...) and I already hate how it will ruin her drip, because it looks so ugly/stupid. And before anybody says anything about it: Yes, I'm well aware of the yokai reference the umbrella has with the eye and tongue, but it still doesn't change the fact that I think that face is really ugly and while an umbrella as a weapon may work in certain stories/games/etc., it doesn't work for me in Genshin IMO. Seeing Shinobu putting that thing away in her Inazuma-style sheath just looks stupid as hell and I just don't like it. Therefore I use/prefer Iron Sting on her, despite it not matching her colors that well.
            If you're concerned about Furina drip then Fav doesn't look too bad on her. Shinobu also works just fine with the dark iron sword (If you didn't feed it into something) Its colors fit her very well and it's only a 24 em decrease.
                "Unfortunately" the elemental skill CR bonus the pipe gives is just too good to ignore for her, so I'll probably stick with the pipe for her. And thanks, I know of the dark iron sword, but I'm fine with Iron Sting on Shinobu.
Two fishes an umbrella and pipes with incoveniently placed connectors. Neat :D
I put the tuna on Sayu. No regrets.
I haven't seen either of those swords💀
    one is from the event (The umbrella) the other was added in 4.0. You can find it at the Fountaine fishing association
Awh yes make me feel bad for missing event weapons :(
I’m just sad I can’t get some
Of them
How does one get the pipe sword again?
    Fontaine Fishing Association.
        Oh no...  Is it as much of a time-sink to get as the Catch?
            Not at all. it took me 2 weeks to get the catch. This took me 3 days. If the fish you want aren't showing up, try fast-forwarding time from day to night (and vice versa). If they still aren't there, then just wait a day, or join somebody's world.
where the fuck can I get the pipe one 😭😭😭😭
I still haven't forgiven MHY for Luxurious Sea Lord's original description.

>Old description: Increases Elemental Burst DMG by (12/15/18/21/24)%. When Elemental Burst hits opponents, there is a 100% chance of summoning a **titanic tuna** that charges and deals (100/125/150/175/200)% ATK as AoE DMG. This effect can occur once every 15s.

(Emphasis mine)

And then you use the weapon and then it's this swarm of tiny tuna. :(

I was so ready to drop a giant tuna on enemies like Childe weekly boss drops a whale on us but I was denied. :(
Ehhhhh still have to do Fontaine fishing. Uggggh fishing. 


I do love the fishing reward weapons though.
They’d get more praise if half of those thing not time locked
i use the 3rd weapon on kuki
I havent found the sumeru fish for that and im not exactly ready to fish in fontaine.
Lmao a lot of people don't even know that the fish bow exist 💀
I don't care for the pipe, but the other 3 are fantastic.

I just wish they had been made better. Using a claymore with atk% main stat just feels bleh when something like Serpent Spine exists (even if its a BP weapon).
Pipe will get a lot of attention once furina is released, don't have that fish claymore, umbrella is good but i generally prefer xiphos over it, fish bow is kinda meh
Wait is that Sabo's pipe?
I never want to think about the ferryman again. I just finished r5ing it. I am so sick of fishing
well thats prob cuz they're limited weapons, some ppl who started later dont even know they exist😭
I'll always have my gratitude to Tokabou for letting me enjoy Hyperbloom before getting Xiphos. She was with Kuki before but now is wielded by my Dendro MC. 

Such a goofy umbrella yokai "sword"~
I use the red devil eye sword on kazuha..fits him really well
Sadly the game is oversaturated with ER stat weapons in the 4 star category,

&#x200B;

i just wish they would add another stats in 4 stars heck we got our first HP 4 star now
I didn't even knew it existed
Well the pipe is a really strong onehanded sword, the claymore is pretty decent and the umbrella is also really good. It's only the bow that's standing out, it's increadibly mid and if you don't wanna fish for it, don't do it. It is not worth the time.
Sorry, but I have Festering Desire.

And pretty Sure that Toukabou Shigure is somewhat popular in Kazuha Builds (not any better than iron Sting stat-wise, but a feast for the eyes)... If you don't have Xiphos Moonlight, that is.
I love that umbrella sword, it looks good on Kazuha and it has em and it looks goofy as hell so I like to wack enemies with it. Heheh it’s perfect
I am working towards that pipe rn, I think it's going to look great on Bennett with his scruffy adventurepunk aesthetic. I'm less excited about a true BiS weapon than I am for a functional weapon that looks awesome with the character.
Still waiting for a cane (sword) and no Neuvilette doesnt count.
This is why I wish HoYo would release weapon skins and more joke weapons. I don't use claymore much, but if we had skins, I'd definitely give them that pipe or fish.
There’s nothing more satisfying than smacking someone with a giant fish or an umbrella
If you explore dragonspine there's a craftable physical dmg weapon you can get.
    It's free if you light up the torches
        [removed]
            No one mentioned swords
                They're a bot
    Where?
        It's actually very hard to find if you don't already know where to look. I love it when games add very esoteric secrets with actually interesting rewards - and the Dragonspine weapons aren't the best but its still really cool to get them as rewards for exploring the nooks and crannies of the zone. I would just follow the wiki or a youtube guide like [right here.](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Snow-Tombed_Starsilver#Availability) It might take you ages to find otherwise
            The Dragonspine weapons are quite usable on cryo characters, specially the Snowtomb Starsilver for Eula. It matches her kit (physical dmg bonus% and extra instance of dmg from the icicle when the enemy has cryo aplied) and design.
                If by "especially" you mean "only" then sure.

Dragonspine Spear is total ass, and even cryo characters prefer Crescent Pike for a physical build. They both cost the same billets, and R1 Crescent Pike is still better than R5 Dragonspine.

Frostbearer was and will still be ass once we finally get our first ever cryo catalyst(s).
            Is it the one where you need 7 artifacts to open some door?
        Don't bother. It's ass. Sea lord is better in an r5 to r5 comparison.
            But sealord is event limited.
                The question is the weapon comparison, not about availability. If you have Sealord good for you but if not than use that Dragonspine claymore for Eula.
                    Yeah, but im assuming that the dude doesnt have sealord or r5 based on their comments, so this comment serves no purpose to him.
                        I don't think they're trying to be relevant to someone else, it's just pure comparison
                [deleted]
                    And the person you replied to asked "Where" and "But it's event limited"

It's easier to assume that they don't have it and answer the question than to outright deny it. They just wanted to know how to get it, not if it's better or not.
                        Then why the downvotes before the mention of event limited? The comment chain was making it sound like the one from dragonspine was better and should replace the tuna, so "don't bother, sea lord is better" is a very reasonable thing to say at that moment.
                            Yeah, but the question is "Where is the Craftable Phys Weapon?"

Not "Is it better than Tuna?"

So those who deemed the response as irrelevant, downvoted. Simple as that.
                                And the answer is it doesn't matter where, just keep using the tuna. Totally relevant. Maybe they thought it was the same user with Eula, or at least also letting them know too.

If anything, the OP has the irrelevant response, yet they have 200 upvotes on their reply.
            Wait, how is the sealors better?
                More burst damage
                The Starsilver passive is too bad. Sealord has less base damage but it's bonuses more than make up for it. Especially with refinement, since r5 Starsilver is equally useless.
    The fish is better on Eula than that weapon.
    Said weapon isn’t even better than prototype archaic
    Some random coop Spanish player helped me get the sword, solve puzzles for some cheats and cleared up the mobs for new me.. despite the language barrier he/she played like a live quest for me even when I dint stepped at dragonspine at the time
I remember once I joined a low AR random co op with the fish claymore.

And the dude kicked me thinking I was hacking.
Its not frozen. It pretends to be dead until it finds a worthy opponent.
B-b-big fish???
The new crafted claymore, Tidal Shadow, is also not too bad on her. And it fits her quite well imo.
That tuna is one lucky guy.
If that baguette is a sword, you can damn well expect that my Furina would be running around with it.
    imagine we get a cake themed 4☆ weapon in an event being perfect for Furina
    Or Polearm for Arle 😳
        no leaks pls
If it's an event item, I will make damn sure that I make time to get the item and max it. Baguette sword or Claymore let's gooooo
A croissant bow too
I would rip my redhorn off Itto just to use a baguette claymore on him. Even if it’s EM or HP scaling, idc - I will make it work.
And a Quaso Catalyst
I use it on kazuha. Perfectly matches his colors!
    It really does look amazing on kazuha!
        [removed]
            Cinnabar kazuha meta
            I think you might have replied to the wrong comment, as I am very confused lol
    This. I used to put the umbrella on Kuki. But when I got Kazuha, I switched. Though it's ironic that he uses an umbrella as a sword, for being a descendant of Kaedehara clan, famous for their bladesmithing lol. He's a bit silly this way.
        Kazuha would use Touka if I didn't have Kuki And a Xiphos Moonlight.  Touka is too beautiful on Kuki, and Xiphos just looks right on him somehow.
            Xiphos passive has way more use on him too as he frequently plays with energy-hungry teams
                Well, he is quite energy hungry himself at c0 so it fits him perfectly
        [removed]
        Any Gintama fan would find it funny to see a samurai use an Amanto weapon.
        Black Iron Sword isn't her best weapon, but it looks really good on Kuki
    Same, it works quite well!
    I’m so pissed I missed this event (was taking a break). Now my Kazuha is stuck with his story quest weapon
Same!
    Same
        Same
I use mine on Alhaitham since his sig avoided me like the plague and I didn't have an iron sting for him at the time. I do now but I'm almost too attached to my umbrella to give it up lol
    I do too! I think it works rather well with him.
    My Alhaitham has the umbrella too and it works amazing tbh
    [removed]
    Same and it physically hurts me how bad it looks on him lol
Same
If you got the new HP sword, she loves it even more. Especially if yours does the job of healing.
    Only works on second rotation though, so I'll keep my Kaj-nisut
        Khaj just is better as a whole because the team buffs are much superior.
            True but not everyone pulls on weapon banner. New sword is good if you don't have Khaj.
                New sword is also a weapon banner exclusive weapon. And is a 4*, which is arguably harder to confirm. 🤨
                    Forgot about that part. Equally true. Somehow I decided to get it for my guaranteed Furina (in case I fail to get signature), and got it on my 13th single pull on weapon banner. Got another Favonius in between, so it was good pull.
                        Fav sword is the hardest weapon for me to get. I swear. I had one at R5, but I lost it. Might have "accidentally" fed it to something when I was high. 🤒🤒

But getting the sword on your 13th pull is crazy lucky. It took me 30 or 40 lmao.
                            Yeah. I had 50 pulls saved & ready to waste 30 of them before I hit soft pity on weapon banner (right now at 40 something). I have all my Favonius weapons (claymore, sword, catalyst & bow) at R4. They kind of come in rotation from standard banner & occasional weapon banner pulls (I do at least a 10 pull per patch on weapon banner).
                                I've noticed that a big reason I don't get many Fav swords is cuz the weapon banners it usually pops up in, I have no interest in. 😒😒
                        Just an FYI, unless her signature is buffed in beta it is pretty bad. You're better of using Festering Desire (if you have it) or PJC. It really isn't worth pulling for her Sword atm.

Unless you just want it for the aesthetics.
                            The whole reason I pulled on the current banner was this one. The leaks pointed out that signature is bad & so rather than getting a bad 5* later, I tried to get a good 4* now.
                    Decided to try to snag it avoiding the 5* and got 2 of this new HP% sword on my 2nd 10-pull. My Furina and my Kirara will be eating well
    yeah, probably a Dockhand Assistant would be BIS on her not only with HP substats, she will get an elemental and energy after consuming the stack.
        Sounds good. That way I can keep Xiphos for Kazuha and Khaj for Nilou.
        Better than Key and Freedom Sworn? I got R2 from this banner, but not sure what to make of it yet. My Shinobu and Layala run with Freedom Sworn and Key of Khaj Nisut respectively.
            man, DHA is nothing compared to the utility of your 5-star weapon. Since I don't have any premium weapon, I'm using DHA and considered as BIS for my Kuki since she can support my Neuvi for buffing his EM and act as little battery.
Saaame
Not only do the colors go well with Kuki, but also the goofy face of the umbrella probably reminds Kuki of Itto which can trigger her to start whacking things harder than before.
I gave the umbrella weapon to Alhaitham over Iron Sting for the sole reason that it looks funny on him
Honestly very sad I was on a break during that. I've gotten every event weapon since dodoco tales aside from that one
Umbrella got the drip but it's strictly worse than Xiphos
As soon as I got Touka, onto Kuki it went.  It will never leave her.  It is too perfect for her Aesthetically.
I did put this on Kuki as well
Same. And Lynette likes it too, but Kuki likes it more.
The problem is that Cinnabar is the only 4* sword that scales with DEF%, and it's also his Signature weapons. And for some reasons is not obtainable during the weapon banner alongside with Albedo's one. 

Just why? Make it a pullable sword at least, pls Hoyo!
    And it’s also the weapon they use in his trial. Like they literally let you try him with a weapon a new player will never possibly obtain!
        Exactly this.  Whenever I see people argue that event weapons should stay limited, I always bring up Cinnabar Spindle.  There's no good reason why they would make Cinnabar Spindle a limited weapon you can never get again, and then give it to Albedo in trials.

I still consider myself to be *insanely* lucky that I started playing Genshin when I did.  I started playing in late 2.2, just before pre-install for 2.3 and just in time to pick up Aloy late.

That event was my first event, and I was thankfully able to get both Cinnabar Spindle and R5 it...even though that poor sword has to live with the trauma of my very, very dumb self planning to run it on Xingqiu cause I had zero idea what I was doing back then (plan was abandoned as swiftly as the character).  It's with Albedo now, so it's being properly being taken care of, as it should be.
            > Whenever I see people argue that event weapons should stay limited

It's such a stupid decision. I have friends that refuse to ever return to the game because of that bs. There's a point where the FOMO keeps players from returning rather than retaining them. 

At the very least (if they cared about player retention), they should have time limited runs where the weapon returns. 

If they were kinder, they would have the weapons become purchasable in the shops and stuff after a certain amount of time (but that's just wishful thinking.
                See that just makes sense to make them purchasable blueprints or something. As much as they do right, exclusive weapons, story quests, and whole areas/maps are just not fun. Just take a year to return it, you get the same experience of some degree of exclusivity without being permanently unable to get Dodoco Tales just bc you discovered Genshin after it was released :(
        That is one of the biggest reasons I keep feedbacking Hoyo as to why I'll never care for Albedo and Fischl and pull/play for them. They've locked their content (weapon and/or stories) behind the past so I'll never experience it. Why would I care about someone who's best build (or equivalent) is impossible to get especially when to me, they have no story for me? Albedo's worried they'll destroy Mondstadt one day? He's just a weirdo. Why would I care about this one weird girl who pretends to be friends with us the day we met her while playing TCG? Fischl is a schizophrenic girl in my eye. Hoyo please bring access to their story and/or weapon back you're literally losing money now without them.

Atleast they learned their lesson in Sumeru with Kaveh and let you know his backstory (albeit in a condensed version) in his hangout quest too besides the limited event.
            [deleted]
                > They've locked their content (weapon and**/or stories)**
                    Okay, but the sentence immediately after that one makes it pretty clear that they think it's an optimal weapon for her
                        no it doesnt? what sentence are u talking about 😭
                Yep. Fischl is perfectly fine using Stringless or even a worse bow.

Albedo was using Harbinger of Dawn for a YEAR and doing pretty great without his even better sword.
            Isn’t fischl’s weapon on banner rn? Or did she have another one?
                Tbh Mitternacht Waltz isn’t even her best 4* weapon. It’s decent for on-field physical Fischl, but for any other Fischl build you’d much rather run Stringless.

Of course if you want to talk true bis weapon it’s Polar Star.
                    Meanwhile I run her with Alley Hunter (her BIS off-field DPS), which also meshes perfectly with her alt outfit.
                    Surely stringless is, at least for aggravate teams?
                        Stringless is definitely her best 4 star in aggravate.
                They meant her story which was a limited time event.
                    Are they referring to the 2.8 GAA Fischl story?
                        Probably 1.1 Unreconciled Stars (Scaramouche was also introduced there, and it's where Fischl and Mona first became friends). But Fischl's mind palace story has the same issue.
                            Ooohh I’ll have to YouTube then lmao
                Fischls weapon is Alley Hunter wdym
            I don't get why they don't rerun events. It's extra content for (almost) no effort.
                Apparently HSR allows you to play certain older events from a menu after they're done running. So they definitely know it's something players want.
                    I think just the ones rhat unlock new areas, though (at least so far).  Genshin just doesn't have nee area events be limited time at all.
                        Golden Apple Archipelago and the Veluriyam Mirage which were designed to be specifically limited. (There was also a separate Enkanomiya for the Bokosu Box due to slightly altered environments and event mechanics despite being the same map that the user can swap between the original and the event version.)
                            Yes, absolutely.  (I've been playing since 2.0 so I played all that except gaa ).  But those were temporary locations, not permanent map spots with quests wired up to thm,, like the museum and market.

Genshin has locationa that open uo with non-archon quests too -- ekanomia, chasm, dragonspine,  But the quests involved are officially permanent, woth the extra event quest/rewards associated taked on (and including story that's l9st after the event ends).  HSR still has the extra rewards, but the story for the location quest ends up all inside the premanent event, not half and half. (the ekanomia event location is a weird outlier there).
            Fischl’s weapon is literally on the banner right now (and it’s useless of her anyways).
                Stringless is best for her, right?
                    Yeah for aggravate it's good, still think any crit 5 star bow is better though
                    Not necessarily since she has a lot of good options but it's pretty good on her.
                    For Aggravate it’s her best 4*, generic Crit bows are better for Taser or other teams.
                        I see. I guess my perspective was skewed since I play her with Keqing.
                        Doesn't she also really like Alley Hunter?
                            Alley hunter is technically better, though the difference is small in aggravate teams.

People just suggest stringless more frequently because it's on banners more and more more likely you have refines on it.
                I guess you never heard about physical fischl
                    Yeah but she wants Rust.
            Trust in N. I really hope she appears in person in the future so that we can go back and play lost events, and/or buy weapons supposedly lost to new players. Klee's signature Dodoco Tales is also event-locked, IIRC.
            They need to add event quests to a playable archive. I don't care about the primos or mora or rewards, obviously those would be limited. They made the game so heavily centered around story and lore, and then just make some of their best content evaporate after a few weeks.

I mean jeezus, you can't even play through permanent quests again and get the full experience of the story, see the cutscenes, or even see the characters interacting visually while they give their lines. (I'd love to be able to re-play world quests again too, like the quest line with Jeht was so good). They're not afraid of re-played content in general, the weekly bosses are a major event we re-experience and somehow that didn't ruin the game.

(Side gripe I wish they'd make character gameplay trials permanent in the character archive. I mean you DO want me to spend several months jonesing for a 5-star, right? How would I care if I've never played them and don't remember the 4 seconds of play from their story quest I completed 7 months ago and can never re-play? Also side side gripe why can we view characters we don't own in the character archive--which is a good thing--but can't view weapons we don't own in the weapon archive? It's such a basic thing to make known what weapons exist in the game so you can plan your account.)
            Yikes
            This is such weird logic to me, I can agree having Albedo's weapon locked behind FOMO is stupid af but if you're curious enough about the characters why not just go on YT and watch some playthroughs of the events they were relevant in? It sucks you have to resort to watching old content on YT but at least you have that available to you, if you're going to tell me you don't want to do that (my words, not yours) JUST because you have to goto YT to watch past stuff that's on you but you can't entirely complain you don't have access to any story or background for them.

This reply is also longer than I even intended for it to be or else i'd actually tell you why you're wrong about Albedo and Fischl but you're entitled to your own opinion on a character but it's weird to me to just dismiss them if you won't even attempt to look anything up about their character (if you even care to) instead of just complaining about it.
                roast their ass hell yeah
        Albedo has been gone for 1 year so far. Been waiting for him since 3.1 . Hoyo is just trolling with everything regarding that character
            Hasn’t *quite* been a year yet (5 days until it is… same amount of time since the last limited 5 star waifu was released…)

I don’t know why Hoyoverse is so insistent on making Mond characters wait a long time for reruns.
    Personally, I'm of the opinion that they should put event four-star weapons in the starglitter shop like the Royal and Blackcliff weapons, and have them at 24 starglitter like the rest.
        Why they dont do that yet is beyond me
            FOMO. If there are weapons you'll never gain access to in game if you don't play, then you will always play so you don't miss out. If they make it available in any other format, the strategy isn't effective.
                Having to check back in each month or two and pull for more glitter locks people in to keep playing, and is still a huge incentive to actually be there for the event to skip all that.
    Same with dodoco tales being the real signature for Klee. Plus festering desire being actually good on a few characters.
    they could just add it to the mondstadt fishing vendor if nothing else
Festring desires is same.
    Yeah but festering is no one's bis compared to cinnabar.So if u don't have festering,its not that big of a loss compared to not having cinnabar
        Festering is going to be F2P BiS for Furina.
            Isn't pipe better?
                No
                    Ah, you're right. I'll better give Festering Desire to her and leave the pipe for DMC.
        yeah well festering desires bis character isn't out yet so...
            She will be out next patch i meant bis 4star
            I doubt it will be her BiS, they will prob tweak the beta stats on the new weapon

What is this copium downvotes, you really think festering desire will be better than the gacha weapon? Are you dumb?
                It's BiS aside from her signature.

The signature is still best, but Festering Desire is significantly above every other option, even other 5 star weapons.
        Festering is a really good F2P on a lot of characters, and is Furina's BIS 4*. Lmao. The slander is real. Also, Festering is better than every weapon OP posted. 💀
            You're not getting my point,first of all furina's kit isn't finalized yet so her 4 star bis can change and u yourself said that it's good(not the best) on a lot of characters but cinnabar is bis so missing cinnabar is a bigger loss than festering unless u never plan on pulling albedo
                It's not going to change that drastically. Festering _will_ be the BIS 4* on Furina. 😅
                    The best part is it will not only be her 4star bis but might as well be overall 2nd bis wep or... Even the 1st bis itself over her Sig(depending cases/situation)
                        With characters like Furina and Yelan, I just typically prefer ER weapons. It's easy to gain plenty of HP in substats, but ER is always harder to get.
                    She's an archon so we never know.Also still festering isn't bis for furina,her 5 star weapon will be her real bis.Meanwhile for albedo,cinnabar is his bis even compared to other 5 stars
                        Lmao. Nobody else in beta ever had their beta best in slot options change completely. So, there's that. And, sure, her 5* will be really good. But Furina is also still one of the most energy hungry characters in the game, who also has a skill that doesn't produce many particles through the duration, which is why ER weapons like Fav and Festering will likely just be easier, and better, to use in practice. Part of why Baizhu's weapon, while technically being his BIS, is so fucking mid. Favonius Codex is just better in actual gameplay. Kind of similar to Yelan, too. Sure, Aqua is good, but ER weapons are so much better.
                            ER is not the reason why Baizhu’s weapon isn’t worth it (it’s not even “just mid” in him since it is literally his BiS).

Jadefall’s passive at R1 *actually restores more energy and heals more than R5 Prototype Amber for Baizhu because of the way the passive works*. R5 PAmber gives 18 energy in one burst, R1 Jadefall gives 22.5 energy in one burst. In practice and on paper, no weapon is better than Jadefall on Baizhu specifically, unless you want to battery the team (then you use Favonius but even then Jadefall is still better for Baizhu’s personal energy gain).

Jadefall is literally a better PAmber on Baizhu; no arguments whatsoever because it’s literally the same passive and stats but higher.

You can’t really say Fav is better in this case since that’s a team dependent thing instead of being a Baizhu dependent thing; if the rest of your team has no energy issues then Jadefall is still best.

The real reason Jadefall is “mid” in general is that it’s *ONLY* BiS for Baizhu. Nobody else gets good mileage out of it.
                                Fav is just better lmao.
                            Still my point stands that her bis is her 5 star weapon.
                                If you have over 200% ER on her without an ER weapon, sure! But you probably won't have 40k HP. 😅 Her weapon is one of the biggest baits for whales/simps that I've ever seen.
                        Honestly Festering is looking stronger than her Sig rn

Sure unless further changes turn tides that's not in our hands,but as of now Festering is in the favor
                        I mean, of course Furina's BiS will be her signature weapon. Albedo's 5* signature doesn't even exist.


If you made it so Furina's 5* sig also didn't exist, then that means (at her current stats in double Hydro), Festering IS her BiS.


Hoyo can still release Albedo's sig just like they did with Venti's though/copium
                    Isnt the new battle pass sword better at R5? Gives the same damage percent ( 32) and gives 4 more crit rate and has crit rate substat. Oh and it buffs burst as well. Its not f2p though
                        Maybe, but the sword is third on my list of new Battle Pass weapons to get to R5. First is the Spear, then the Jade, and then the sword. My EM Raiden wants that 240 EM.
        >!its very good for furina only 20% worse than her own 5 star weapon!<
            >!I'd say it's better than her sig if she's a solo hydro!<
        Very understandable, we don't have hp sword too which is a bummer, hoyo fear nilou.
            Check current weapon banner.
                Event/fishing weapons.
        Sadly, but Festering is no one’s bis only in current version.
Cinnabar Spindle is half the reason imma pull for Albedo sooner or later. Have always loved everything about him but never had a reason to pull until I got Cinnabar
    I mean, yeah! I have a decent artefact set and Cinnabar ready for him, but he's nowhere to be seen.
Honestly, doesn't beat new and a lot of semi-old players realizing they'll never get Festering Desire, Furina's 4 star BiS
    Eh I mean I think fleuve cendre is decent as well and favonious sword is also as good imo as she has er problems as far as im aware
        Fav is always good but fleuve is literally festering desire cope, I think it's strictly worse
        Fleuve is copium
I wish they added the event weapons to Paimon's Shop. Let us buy them with Starglitter at least.
They should update the starglitter shop and put it there with it's refinement materials.
I’ve got that but no Albedo! None else uses it
At least Harbinger is still solid on him
I hate stuff like that, its just plain stupid. Its not even about collecting stuff, its about actual gameplay
your telling me a pipe or a frozen fish are not the strongest weapons in the game? Time to file several complaints until every meta player is forced to use them!!
Stats shit? If people on this sub, full of 2-3 year old veterans, knew that tons of casual players are using these weapons because they are F2P and these weapons are quite good because Genshin does not require the best stuff to have a great time.
I always end up thinking of this. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=T8XeDvKqI4E
Kaveh is the only 4 star I don't have
I get that. I love festering desire's design. I want it, but my desire will be left... festering... but agreed. Event weapons should be sold at the specialty shops you spend sigils at, even if it costs primos.
You only get one festering desire. I personally think the pipe was supposed to be a post 1.2 festering desire. Not a day goes by where I wish they'd put them somewhere in game, maybe add an event shop or banner for Weapons and Aloy
For many people the umbrella and the other event weapons don’t exist. I know I was pissed to find out I can never get it, cuz I would love a yokai sword.
    Im an 1.0 player and for a long time I didnt wanted newer players to get these weapons but after some time (and also cuz I started playing Arknights and missing a collab unit forever) I changed my mind, hoyo is just cringe with Genshin, Honkai impact that is older has a special shop for these types of items.

But then again, that game also has artifact loadouts and some skill effects can be turned off(like we want for constellations), Genshin devs either dont habe time to add more QoLs or just dont care.
        I think Genshin is the samsara spin-off of Impact that got more popular than they expected and so doesn’t get the same resources, sadly. :/ I could be wrong, but considering the differences between Genshin and both Honkai games, it’s the impression I get.
            Bruh, its simple; Genshin gets the money, Honkai gets the love.
Get yo ass back in the chat. This is even more of a win for this weapon that it looks goofy/funny AND has decent stats
Monster hunter world. My character wears a cat mask and has floppy dual sword fish. When I enter demon mode, the eyes go from blue to red. It's like they go into a blind rage.
I can imagine xiao slaying literal demons with a broom 💀
Not if you don't care and just want er, im running the fish bow on my c6 faruzan and she running very well.
    Sure, but Favonious Bow exist and everyone get that one for free plus it has a better passive, but you can use the fish as well if you want.
        >but Favonious Bow exist and everyone get that one for free plus

You get 1 Fav bow for free.

There's quite a few Bow Users in the game who want an ER bow.

If You're not a long time player, then you probably don't have heaps of sacs/favs to spare.      
Even then, being a long time player doesn't prevent you from getting screwed by RNG (I've been playing since 1.2 and I have 1 singular R3 Fav bow, bruh.
            Me with my ONE crescent pike, playing since sept 2021.
                Crescent pike is a craftable Weapon thought.

You also get at least one guaranteed billet of each weapon type per Nation
                    Not gonna lie, I prioritized the dragon spine spear because I’m vain and wanted rosaria to be a e s t h e t I c
            I’ve been playing since 1.3 and I’ve only gotten one Stringless. Plenty of Bells though lol.
        People usually dont have bucket loads of sac and fav weapons, some cant be bothered to swap everytime, so i think some of teh lesser weapons are useable and comes with the bonus of looking cool/ridicoulus ;)
I personally don't care if it's worth using. To be honest, I don't even have it yet. I just think it looks neat, probably the worse in design and gameplay out of the 3.
    I mean... all it had to be was a bow version of Lux Sealord and it would've been great.
It's a guaranteed ER% Weapon.

Even if the passive is dead, it's still useful if you have a support who needs ER and you can't spare a sac/fav (either because they're occupied or because rng hates you)
Faruzan can kinda use it... but yeah, just use a Favonius Warbow instead.
Agree, I'd rather have Eula's F2P BiS to be a good looking sword rather than this stupid fish. I'm never using it unless we'll get a transmog feature.
When I got back into playing it was during the Festering Desire event. I kid you not. I looked the weapon in the eye, thought "oh cool, you get free weapons for playing through the story" then proceeded to ignore the event thinking I could do later.

I have since vowed to never skip an event. No matter how small or irrelevant it seems.
I don't understand why they're not added to the Souvenir vendor or something like the gadgets.
Agreed. They could have reused the event (like literally rerun the quests) and slapped a new weapon to farm but nope.
I agree with you 100%. That's also the reason why I believe Albedo, as a new player, is the most insignificant character in the game. His BiS weapon? locked behind an event. His story? 90% of it locked behind events hoyo said they'll never rerun. Albedo, at this point, is nothing but a character with no story.
>definitely the worst free 4* weapon they have ever released.

End of the Line is an ER% weapon. Meaning it still has decent value as a simple *guaranteed* stat stick.

Not every player has a dozen max refined Sacs/favs and not everyone bothers with swapping weapons.

The worst free 4 star weapon is the Fontaine craftable polearm. Outclassed in every way it could be used in and not even valuable as a stat stick.
Yea... both design and gameplay wise it's unremarkable. But still childe's autos look goofy with it
christ
Fish bow and fish claymore substas are cringe
    Fish bow is just worse fav bow which you already get for free so fair but the claymore isn't completely terrible. It's essentially a more burst oriented prototype archaic which while nothing special it can be decentish for the f2p players that got it. Attack% while dendro reactions generally make it less useful, it's not that bad of a stat to have. Bigger thing is more so claymore characters arguably being the weakest weapon type in terms of the units.
        Fav bow is just so contested.. half the bow users want one, lol. I gave the Fish bow to Faruzan. It's alright. And there's also the Twilight something bow that was an event reward.. i gave that to Yelan. Works decently enough as well. I'm not playing the numbers game so whether it's 2% better or worse, i don't care. If the sub stat is right i can dig it.
            It's a lot more than just 2% worse to fav lol. Fav naturally has more er for the substat but the passive further reduces er requirements for the entire team. Meanwhile the passive for the fish bow is near useless. 

Fading twilight on Yelan really isn't great even if you aren't able to give Yelan fav for whatever reason, 3 star bows like recurve bow or slingshot are both better and if you need the er you just run er sands. High refine stringless/mouuns moon can be viable and technically don't even need to be levelled to be used. 

Also there is sac bow which depending on the team and refine can get you an extra skill use every rotation which is quite good. 

The actual niche for getting the fish bow especially having to grind for it with fishing is just so small. You are better off just keeping extra copies of fav bow without refining if you need that many of them.
                The catch is the only fishing weapon were getting it is an actual grind.

Both the fish bow and the pipe have absolutely trivial fish costs.
If you need ER% and don't have w sac or fav to spare
Not really, there's Iron Sting that has the exact same stats, only a different passive, and it's craftable.
    Iron Sting and the Umbrella are only used as EM stat sticks lmao. Their passives don't do jack shit on the characters using them. 😅 Xiphos' actually has a passive used in combat, and is arguably better on Kazuha than Freedom-Sworn.
        Just saying cause you wrote that the only good alternative to umbrella is Xiphos. It's not, Iron Sting is on par with umbrella. Xiphos is for sure the only one with a useful passive tho.
            I said _actual_ good. Iron Sting is one of the most mid weapons in the game, and was only ever used due to being the only EM sword, other than Freedom-Sworn, for almost 2 years. Iron Sting is passable at best. If we had other EM swords as alternatives, nobody would use it.
        Alhaitham can use both the EM substat and the passive of those two weapons well. They are his top F2P 4-star options. Same for Keqing aggravate.
            I mean. Most event 4* and craftable are a character's BIS "F2P" option because F2P players always have mid options available to them. 🤭 neither weapon are in the top3 best 4* weapons as a whole.
                For those characters, they are, actually. I only said F2P to exclude Wolf-Fang.
        >Iron Sting and the Umbrella are only used as EM stat sticks lmao. Their passives don't do jack shit on the characters using them.

Aggravate Keqing and Spread Al haitham
            Alhaitham would rather have Xiphos' there. Even the new BP sword blows both Umbrella and ISting out of the water. They're still only EM stat sticks in both cases.
                Irrelevant to the point that is being refuted.
                    Not really. They're still only being used as EM statsticks.
                        Except they're not just EM stat sticks.

Iron sting

> Dealing Elemental DMG increases all DMG by 6%-12% for 6s. Max 2 stacks. Can only occur once every 1s.

Toukabou Shigure

> After an attack hits opponents, it will inflict an instance of Cursed Parasol upon one of them for 10s. This effect can be triggered once every 15s. If this opponent is defeated during Cursed Parasol's duration, Cursed Parasol's CD will be refreshed immediately. The character wielding this weapon will deal 16-32% more DMG to the opponent affected by Cursed Parasol.

Both weapons provide a DMG bonus buff to the user.

Since both Keqing and Al haitham are Talent multiplier based DPS, they actually can make use of DMG bonuses, thus both characters actually fully utilize the weapon passive.
                            They're pretty much just EM statsticks.
                                No way in hell you actually read and acknowledged the information presented in my reply.
If I had her, I'd use it on her too. I don't think I'd feel right handing her a sword when I can imagine her incorporating an umbrella into her dances.
Unfortunately the fish claymore and umbrella sword were event weapons and are no longer obtainable. 

The pipe sword is from fontaine's fishing association and the fish bow is from sumeru's fishing association

Inazuma fishing association also has "The Catch" an er polearm that increase burst dmg and burst crit rate.
    I have the catch got it back when it first came out  umbrella sword looks really good hope they sell it in the jewellery shop there 3 jewellery shop that are totally useless have nothing to sell
        Which shops? If you can't buy from them it means you haven't maxed out that region's sigil tree yet.
Inazuma has the Sakura tree at the shrine, Sumeru's is locked behind the aranara quest and fontaine's is the fountain  in front of the opera house. Once those are maxed out, then you can buy from that region's shop.
            Ohh I haven't sumeru tree and fountain  not planing to max them same with the status of the 7  

I would level the status if they give stamina or 5star weapon  but the current reward worthless to me
It increase the weilder's er for 5 seconds after using a skill so any particules/energy obtained in those 5 second are increased also this is r1 (at r5 it's 32% er) with the substate it's grand total of 77.9 er
I use the pipe sword for lynette. while I could use sac sword or favonius sword for team er, my team already has pretty good er so the personal er the pipe gives lynette is pretty good. plus it looks funny
The pipe can be used on lynette and benette ( if you have no better base atk options) and supposedly was made for Furina, coming in 4.2

The bow is actually trash and isn't better than any other Ftp option for any character. If you absolutely, must use it then Fishel might work with it, there's just a plethora of better bows.
They're both ER stat sticks.

The pipe sword is Useful on any character who needs a lot of ER and produces energy particles on the initial skill use (Lynette/dendro mc/Xingqiu for example)

The bow is just so so. Useful if you can't spare a sac or fav
I dream of the day lynette becomes a red bow user. Such a sad world.
Fontaine fishermen.  
Those weps like The Catch are permanent.
    So there's a catch to it
You can still fish for it. Fishing weapons do not end like event weapons.
    I knew something smelt fishy Didn't even it was a fishing weapon, thx for letting me know.
No. Looks cool, though.
    Hopefully when the Hydro Claymore user comes it’ll be useable
Pipe works on Lynette, Hydro MC, maybe in the future with Furina.  
Umbrella works *and* is stylish on Kuki and Kazuha.
Umbrella is for Kuki and Kazuha. Fleuve is for any burst-using support who does not have access to Favonius sword.
It might be her best in slot, but it's contending with favonius
    I see. What would you say is better for her, fav, this thing or the new BP sword?
        I'd say battle pass sword, but it depends on your artifacts. If your sitting pretty at 70 crit rate and good crit dmg then use the pipe or fav for the extra er.

An r1 bp sword grants 16% dmg and 35% crit rate to your skill and burst.

An r5 fav offers offers 61% er and a universal elemental particule on crit (must be on-feild)

An r5 pipe offers 16% skill crit rate, 45.9% er which increases to 77.9% for 5 seconds after a skill. (45.9% substat + 35% from passive)

If your heavily struggling with crit bp weapon, no crit problems the fav, just shy of the crit goal then pipe
I just used the genshin [wiki](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Genshin_Impact_Wiki) fot the images but I'd recommend [project amber](https://ambr.top/en). It shows character kits, weapons, but it also has a setting to turn on and off leaks if your concerned about that too.
Good for Furina if you don't have Festering Desire.
    Better than Favge for teamwide utility/more funneling for your main DPS?
        If you need the ER, Fav but for more DMG/Crt then Festering/pipe is what the theory crafters are recommending.
Yea. I kind of wish it was a plain old umbrella, or had a better looking face. 
It kinda of looks like a snot nosed kid with a missing tooth.
Fontaine fishing association
    Thank you!
My albedo is missing about 5% crit rate for me to feel comfortable with his stats. But I'd sooner lose him than take his sword from him.
Unfortunately not it was an event ran way back in 2.1. Praying that one day, they add an event shop.
I'm sorry for your pain. I feel it too... I looked festering desire in the eye... and forgot to do it's event 😮‍💨
You can still get the pipe from fontaine fishing association, and the bow from sumeru fishing association (tho it's bad unless you have no better options)
    Sweet, thank you. I’ll just rely on my artifacts for damage. Lol.
Fontaine fishing association.
Well to each their own, but I think the umbrella works well with Kazuha's wandering samurai trope (I personally prefer a katana on her), and Bennette with nothing but a pipe seems pretty lore-accurate. I think the pipe looks pretty cool and minus the face, the umbrella is neat.
    The pipe may work on someone like Bennett, yeah, but on anyone else? Not really. And I disagree - I think the pipe looks really ugly too. I'll probably (have to) use it on Furina when she comes out, because I don't have Festering Desire (thanks mihoyo for refusing to bring it back...) and I already hate how it will ruin her drip, because it looks so ugly/stupid. And before anybody says anything about it: Yes, I'm well aware of the yokai reference the umbrella has with the eye and tongue, but it still doesn't change the fact that I think that face is really ugly and while an umbrella as a weapon may work in certain stories/games/etc., it doesn't work for me in Genshin IMO. Seeing Shinobu putting that thing away in her Inazuma-style sheath just looks stupid as hell and I just don't like it. Therefore I use/prefer Iron Sting on her, despite it not matching her colors that well.
        If you're concerned about Furina drip then Fav doesn't look too bad on her. Shinobu also works just fine with the dark iron sword (If you didn't feed it into something) Its colors fit her very well and it's only a 24 em decrease.
            "Unfortunately" the elemental skill CR bonus the pipe gives is just too good to ignore for her, so I'll probably stick with the pipe for her. And thanks, I know of the dark iron sword, but I'm fine with Iron Sting on Shinobu.
one is from the event (The umbrella) the other was added in 4.0. You can find it at the Fountaine fishing association

    Oh no...  Is it as much of a time-sink to get as the Catch?
        Not at all. it took me 2 weeks to get the catch. This took me 3 days. If the fish you want aren't showing up, try fast-forwarding time from day to night (and vice versa). If they still aren't there, then just wait a day, or join somebody's world.

Where?
    It's actually very hard to find if you don't already know where to look. I love it when games add very esoteric secrets with actually interesting rewards - and the Dragonspine weapons aren't the best but its still really cool to get them as rewards for exploring the nooks and crannies of the zone. I would just follow the wiki or a youtube guide like [right here.](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Snow-Tombed_Starsilver#Availability) It might take you ages to find otherwise
        The Dragonspine weapons are quite usable on cryo characters, specially the Snowtomb Starsilver for Eula. It matches her kit (physical dmg bonus% and extra instance of dmg from the icicle when the enemy has cryo aplied) and design.
            If by "especially" you mean "only" then sure.

Dragonspine Spear is total ass, and even cryo characters prefer Crescent Pike for a physical build. They both cost the same billets, and R1 Crescent Pike is still better than R5 Dragonspine.

Frostbearer was and will still be ass once we finally get our first ever cryo catalyst(s).
        Is it the one where you need 7 artifacts to open some door?
    Don't bother. It's ass. Sea lord is better in an r5 to r5 comparison.
        But sealord is event limited.
            The question is the weapon comparison, not about availability. If you have Sealord good for you but if not than use that Dragonspine claymore for Eula.
                Yeah, but im assuming that the dude doesnt have sealord or r5 based on their comments, so this comment serves no purpose to him.
                    I don't think they're trying to be relevant to someone else, it's just pure comparison
            [deleted]
                And the person you replied to asked "Where" and "But it's event limited"

It's easier to assume that they don't have it and answer the question than to outright deny it. They just wanted to know how to get it, not if it's better or not.
                    Then why the downvotes before the mention of event limited? The comment chain was making it sound like the one from dragonspine was better and should replace the tuna, so "don't bother, sea lord is better" is a very reasonable thing to say at that moment.
                        Yeah, but the question is "Where is the Craftable Phys Weapon?"

Not "Is it better than Tuna?"

So those who deemed the response as irrelevant, downvoted. Simple as that.
                            And the answer is it doesn't matter where, just keep using the tuna. Totally relevant. Maybe they thought it was the same user with Eula, or at least also letting them know too.

If anything, the OP has the irrelevant response, yet they have 200 upvotes on their reply.
        Wait, how is the sealors better?
            More burst damage
            The Starsilver passive is too bad. Sealord has less base damage but it's bonuses more than make up for it. Especially with refinement, since r5 Starsilver is equally useless.
The fish is better on Eula than that weapon.
Said weapon isn’t even better than prototype archaic
Some random coop Spanish player helped me get the sword, solve puzzles for some cheats and cleared up the mobs for new me.. despite the language barrier he/she played like a live quest for me even when I dint stepped at dragonspine at the time
imagine we get a cake themed 4☆ weapon in an event being perfect for Furina
Or Polearm for Arle 😳
    no leaks pls
It really does look amazing on kazuha!
    [removed]
        Cinnabar kazuha meta
        I think you might have replied to the wrong comment, as I am very confused lol
This. I used to put the umbrella on Kuki. But when I got Kazuha, I switched. Though it's ironic that he uses an umbrella as a sword, for being a descendant of Kaedehara clan, famous for their bladesmithing lol. He's a bit silly this way.
    Kazuha would use Touka if I didn't have Kuki And a Xiphos Moonlight.  Touka is too beautiful on Kuki, and Xiphos just looks right on him somehow.
        Xiphos passive has way more use on him too as he frequently plays with energy-hungry teams
            Well, he is quite energy hungry himself at c0 so it fits him perfectly
    [removed]
    Any Gintama fan would find it funny to see a samurai use an Amanto weapon.
    Black Iron Sword isn't her best weapon, but it looks really good on Kuki
Same, it works quite well!
I’m so pissed I missed this event (was taking a break). Now my Kazuha is stuck with his story quest weapon
Same
    Same
I do too! I think it works rather well with him.
My Alhaitham has the umbrella too and it works amazing tbh
[removed]
Same and it physically hurts me how bad it looks on him lol
Only works on second rotation though, so I'll keep my Kaj-nisut
    Khaj just is better as a whole because the team buffs are much superior.
        True but not everyone pulls on weapon banner. New sword is good if you don't have Khaj.
            New sword is also a weapon banner exclusive weapon. And is a 4*, which is arguably harder to confirm. 🤨
                Forgot about that part. Equally true. Somehow I decided to get it for my guaranteed Furina (in case I fail to get signature), and got it on my 13th single pull on weapon banner. Got another Favonius in between, so it was good pull.
                    Fav sword is the hardest weapon for me to get. I swear. I had one at R5, but I lost it. Might have "accidentally" fed it to something when I was high. 🤒🤒

But getting the sword on your 13th pull is crazy lucky. It took me 30 or 40 lmao.
                        Yeah. I had 50 pulls saved & ready to waste 30 of them before I hit soft pity on weapon banner (right now at 40 something). I have all my Favonius weapons (claymore, sword, catalyst & bow) at R4. They kind of come in rotation from standard banner & occasional weapon banner pulls (I do at least a 10 pull per patch on weapon banner).
                            I've noticed that a big reason I don't get many Fav swords is cuz the weapon banners it usually pops up in, I have no interest in. 😒😒
                    Just an FYI, unless her signature is buffed in beta it is pretty bad. You're better of using Festering Desire (if you have it) or PJC. It really isn't worth pulling for her Sword atm.

Unless you just want it for the aesthetics.
                        The whole reason I pulled on the current banner was this one. The leaks pointed out that signature is bad & so rather than getting a bad 5* later, I tried to get a good 4* now.
                Decided to try to snag it avoiding the 5* and got 2 of this new HP% sword on my 2nd 10-pull. My Furina and my Kirara will be eating well
yeah, probably a Dockhand Assistant would be BIS on her not only with HP substats, she will get an elemental and energy after consuming the stack.
    Sounds good. That way I can keep Xiphos for Kazuha and Khaj for Nilou.
    Better than Key and Freedom Sworn? I got R2 from this banner, but not sure what to make of it yet. My Shinobu and Layala run with Freedom Sworn and Key of Khaj Nisut respectively.
        man, DHA is nothing compared to the utility of your 5-star weapon. Since I don't have any premium weapon, I'm using DHA and considered as BIS for my Kuki since she can support my Neuvi for buffing his EM and act as little battery.
And it’s also the weapon they use in his trial. Like they literally let you try him with a weapon a new player will never possibly obtain!
    Exactly this.  Whenever I see people argue that event weapons should stay limited, I always bring up Cinnabar Spindle.  There's no good reason why they would make Cinnabar Spindle a limited weapon you can never get again, and then give it to Albedo in trials.

I still consider myself to be *insanely* lucky that I started playing Genshin when I did.  I started playing in late 2.2, just before pre-install for 2.3 and just in time to pick up Aloy late.

That event was my first event, and I was thankfully able to get both Cinnabar Spindle and R5 it...even though that poor sword has to live with the trauma of my very, very dumb self planning to run it on Xingqiu cause I had zero idea what I was doing back then (plan was abandoned as swiftly as the character).  It's with Albedo now, so it's being properly being taken care of, as it should be.
        > Whenever I see people argue that event weapons should stay limited

It's such a stupid decision. I have friends that refuse to ever return to the game because of that bs. There's a point where the FOMO keeps players from returning rather than retaining them. 

At the very least (if they cared about player retention), they should have time limited runs where the weapon returns. 

If they were kinder, they would have the weapons become purchasable in the shops and stuff after a certain amount of time (but that's just wishful thinking.
            See that just makes sense to make them purchasable blueprints or something. As much as they do right, exclusive weapons, story quests, and whole areas/maps are just not fun. Just take a year to return it, you get the same experience of some degree of exclusivity without being permanently unable to get Dodoco Tales just bc you discovered Genshin after it was released :(
    That is one of the biggest reasons I keep feedbacking Hoyo as to why I'll never care for Albedo and Fischl and pull/play for them. They've locked their content (weapon and/or stories) behind the past so I'll never experience it. Why would I care about someone who's best build (or equivalent) is impossible to get especially when to me, they have no story for me? Albedo's worried they'll destroy Mondstadt one day? He's just a weirdo. Why would I care about this one weird girl who pretends to be friends with us the day we met her while playing TCG? Fischl is a schizophrenic girl in my eye. Hoyo please bring access to their story and/or weapon back you're literally losing money now without them.

Atleast they learned their lesson in Sumeru with Kaveh and let you know his backstory (albeit in a condensed version) in his hangout quest too besides the limited event.
        [deleted]
            > They've locked their content (weapon and**/or stories)**
                Okay, but the sentence immediately after that one makes it pretty clear that they think it's an optimal weapon for her
                    no it doesnt? what sentence are u talking about 😭
            Yep. Fischl is perfectly fine using Stringless or even a worse bow.

Albedo was using Harbinger of Dawn for a YEAR and doing pretty great without his even better sword.
        Isn’t fischl’s weapon on banner rn? Or did she have another one?
            Tbh Mitternacht Waltz isn’t even her best 4* weapon. It’s decent for on-field physical Fischl, but for any other Fischl build you’d much rather run Stringless.

Of course if you want to talk true bis weapon it’s Polar Star.
                Meanwhile I run her with Alley Hunter (her BIS off-field DPS), which also meshes perfectly with her alt outfit.
                Surely stringless is, at least for aggravate teams?
                    Stringless is definitely her best 4 star in aggravate.
            They meant her story which was a limited time event.
                Are they referring to the 2.8 GAA Fischl story?
                    Probably 1.1 Unreconciled Stars (Scaramouche was also introduced there, and it's where Fischl and Mona first became friends). But Fischl's mind palace story has the same issue.
                        Ooohh I’ll have to YouTube then lmao
            Fischls weapon is Alley Hunter wdym
        I don't get why they don't rerun events. It's extra content for (almost) no effort.
            Apparently HSR allows you to play certain older events from a menu after they're done running. So they definitely know it's something players want.
                I think just the ones rhat unlock new areas, though (at least so far).  Genshin just doesn't have nee area events be limited time at all.
                    Golden Apple Archipelago and the Veluriyam Mirage which were designed to be specifically limited. (There was also a separate Enkanomiya for the Bokosu Box due to slightly altered environments and event mechanics despite being the same map that the user can swap between the original and the event version.)
                        Yes, absolutely.  (I've been playing since 2.0 so I played all that except gaa ).  But those were temporary locations, not permanent map spots with quests wired up to thm,, like the museum and market.

Genshin has locationa that open uo with non-archon quests too -- ekanomia, chasm, dragonspine,  But the quests involved are officially permanent, woth the extra event quest/rewards associated taked on (and including story that's l9st after the event ends).  HSR still has the extra rewards, but the story for the location quest ends up all inside the premanent event, not half and half. (the ekanomia event location is a weird outlier there).
        Fischl’s weapon is literally on the banner right now (and it’s useless of her anyways).
            Stringless is best for her, right?
                Yeah for aggravate it's good, still think any crit 5 star bow is better though
                Not necessarily since she has a lot of good options but it's pretty good on her.
                For Aggravate it’s her best 4*, generic Crit bows are better for Taser or other teams.
                    I see. I guess my perspective was skewed since I play her with Keqing.
                    Doesn't she also really like Alley Hunter?
                        Alley hunter is technically better, though the difference is small in aggravate teams.

People just suggest stringless more frequently because it's on banners more and more more likely you have refines on it.
            I guess you never heard about physical fischl
                Yeah but she wants Rust.
        Trust in N. I really hope she appears in person in the future so that we can go back and play lost events, and/or buy weapons supposedly lost to new players. Klee's signature Dodoco Tales is also event-locked, IIRC.
        They need to add event quests to a playable archive. I don't care about the primos or mora or rewards, obviously those would be limited. They made the game so heavily centered around story and lore, and then just make some of their best content evaporate after a few weeks.

I mean jeezus, you can't even play through permanent quests again and get the full experience of the story, see the cutscenes, or even see the characters interacting visually while they give their lines. (I'd love to be able to re-play world quests again too, like the quest line with Jeht was so good). They're not afraid of re-played content in general, the weekly bosses are a major event we re-experience and somehow that didn't ruin the game.

(Side gripe I wish they'd make character gameplay trials permanent in the character archive. I mean you DO want me to spend several months jonesing for a 5-star, right? How would I care if I've never played them and don't remember the 4 seconds of play from their story quest I completed 7 months ago and can never re-play? Also side side gripe why can we view characters we don't own in the character archive--which is a good thing--but can't view weapons we don't own in the weapon archive? It's such a basic thing to make known what weapons exist in the game so you can plan your account.)
        Yikes
        This is such weird logic to me, I can agree having Albedo's weapon locked behind FOMO is stupid af but if you're curious enough about the characters why not just go on YT and watch some playthroughs of the events they were relevant in? It sucks you have to resort to watching old content on YT but at least you have that available to you, if you're going to tell me you don't want to do that (my words, not yours) JUST because you have to goto YT to watch past stuff that's on you but you can't entirely complain you don't have access to any story or background for them.

This reply is also longer than I even intended for it to be or else i'd actually tell you why you're wrong about Albedo and Fischl but you're entitled to your own opinion on a character but it's weird to me to just dismiss them if you won't even attempt to look anything up about their character (if you even care to) instead of just complaining about it.
            roast their ass hell yeah
    Albedo has been gone for 1 year so far. Been waiting for him since 3.1 . Hoyo is just trolling with everything regarding that character
        Hasn’t *quite* been a year yet (5 days until it is… same amount of time since the last limited 5 star waifu was released…)

I don’t know why Hoyoverse is so insistent on making Mond characters wait a long time for reruns.
Personally, I'm of the opinion that they should put event four-star weapons in the starglitter shop like the Royal and Blackcliff weapons, and have them at 24 starglitter like the rest.
    Why they dont do that yet is beyond me
        FOMO. If there are weapons you'll never gain access to in game if you don't play, then you will always play so you don't miss out. If they make it available in any other format, the strategy isn't effective.
            Having to check back in each month or two and pull for more glitter locks people in to keep playing, and is still a huge incentive to actually be there for the event to skip all that.
Same with dodoco tales being the real signature for Klee. Plus festering desire being actually good on a few characters.
they could just add it to the mondstadt fishing vendor if nothing else
Yeah but festering is no one's bis compared to cinnabar.So if u don't have festering,its not that big of a loss compared to not having cinnabar
    Festering is going to be F2P BiS for Furina.
        Isn't pipe better?
            No
                Ah, you're right. I'll better give Festering Desire to her and leave the pipe for DMC.
    yeah well festering desires bis character isn't out yet so...
        She will be out next patch i meant bis 4star
        I doubt it will be her BiS, they will prob tweak the beta stats on the new weapon

What is this copium downvotes, you really think festering desire will be better than the gacha weapon? Are you dumb?
            It's BiS aside from her signature.

The signature is still best, but Festering Desire is significantly above every other option, even other 5 star weapons.
    Festering is a really good F2P on a lot of characters, and is Furina's BIS 4*. Lmao. The slander is real. Also, Festering is better than every weapon OP posted. 💀
        You're not getting my point,first of all furina's kit isn't finalized yet so her 4 star bis can change and u yourself said that it's good(not the best) on a lot of characters but cinnabar is bis so missing cinnabar is a bigger loss than festering unless u never plan on pulling albedo
            It's not going to change that drastically. Festering _will_ be the BIS 4* on Furina. 😅
                The best part is it will not only be her 4star bis but might as well be overall 2nd bis wep or... Even the 1st bis itself over her Sig(depending cases/situation)
                    With characters like Furina and Yelan, I just typically prefer ER weapons. It's easy to gain plenty of HP in substats, but ER is always harder to get.
                She's an archon so we never know.Also still festering isn't bis for furina,her 5 star weapon will be her real bis.Meanwhile for albedo,cinnabar is his bis even compared to other 5 stars
                    Lmao. Nobody else in beta ever had their beta best in slot options change completely. So, there's that. And, sure, her 5* will be really good. But Furina is also still one of the most energy hungry characters in the game, who also has a skill that doesn't produce many particles through the duration, which is why ER weapons like Fav and Festering will likely just be easier, and better, to use in practice. Part of why Baizhu's weapon, while technically being his BIS, is so fucking mid. Favonius Codex is just better in actual gameplay. Kind of similar to Yelan, too. Sure, Aqua is good, but ER weapons are so much better.
                        ER is not the reason why Baizhu’s weapon isn’t worth it (it’s not even “just mid” in him since it is literally his BiS).

Jadefall’s passive at R1 *actually restores more energy and heals more than R5 Prototype Amber for Baizhu because of the way the passive works*. R5 PAmber gives 18 energy in one burst, R1 Jadefall gives 22.5 energy in one burst. In practice and on paper, no weapon is better than Jadefall on Baizhu specifically, unless you want to battery the team (then you use Favonius but even then Jadefall is still better for Baizhu’s personal energy gain).

Jadefall is literally a better PAmber on Baizhu; no arguments whatsoever because it’s literally the same passive and stats but higher.

You can’t really say Fav is better in this case since that’s a team dependent thing instead of being a Baizhu dependent thing; if the rest of your team has no energy issues then Jadefall is still best.

The real reason Jadefall is “mid” in general is that it’s *ONLY* BiS for Baizhu. Nobody else gets good mileage out of it.
                            Fav is just better lmao.
                        Still my point stands that her bis is her 5 star weapon.
                            If you have over 200% ER on her without an ER weapon, sure! But you probably won't have 40k HP. 😅 Her weapon is one of the biggest baits for whales/simps that I've ever seen.
                    Honestly Festering is looking stronger than her Sig rn

Sure unless further changes turn tides that's not in our hands,but as of now Festering is in the favor
                    I mean, of course Furina's BiS will be her signature weapon. Albedo's 5* signature doesn't even exist.


If you made it so Furina's 5* sig also didn't exist, then that means (at her current stats in double Hydro), Festering IS her BiS.


Hoyo can still release Albedo's sig just like they did with Venti's though/copium
                Isnt the new battle pass sword better at R5? Gives the same damage percent ( 32) and gives 4 more crit rate and has crit rate substat. Oh and it buffs burst as well. Its not f2p though
                    Maybe, but the sword is third on my list of new Battle Pass weapons to get to R5. First is the Spear, then the Jade, and then the sword. My EM Raiden wants that 240 EM.
    >!its very good for furina only 20% worse than her own 5 star weapon!<
        >!I'd say it's better than her sig if she's a solo hydro!<
    Very understandable, we don't have hp sword too which is a bummer, hoyo fear nilou.
        Check current weapon banner.
            Event/fishing weapons.
    Sadly, but Festering is no one’s bis only in current version.
I mean, yeah! I have a decent artefact set and Cinnabar ready for him, but he's nowhere to be seen.
Eh I mean I think fleuve cendre is decent as well and favonious sword is also as good imo as she has er problems as far as im aware
    Fav is always good but fleuve is literally festering desire cope, I think it's strictly worse
    Fleuve is copium
Im an 1.0 player and for a long time I didnt wanted newer players to get these weapons but after some time (and also cuz I started playing Arknights and missing a collab unit forever) I changed my mind, hoyo is just cringe with Genshin, Honkai impact that is older has a special shop for these types of items.

But then again, that game also has artifact loadouts and some skill effects can be turned off(like we want for constellations), Genshin devs either dont habe time to add more QoLs or just dont care.
    I think Genshin is the samsara spin-off of Impact that got more popular than they expected and so doesn’t get the same resources, sadly. :/ I could be wrong, but considering the differences between Genshin and both Honkai games, it’s the impression I get.
        Bruh, its simple; Genshin gets the money, Honkai gets the love.
Sure, but Favonious Bow exist and everyone get that one for free plus it has a better passive, but you can use the fish as well if you want.
    >but Favonious Bow exist and everyone get that one for free plus

You get 1 Fav bow for free.

There's quite a few Bow Users in the game who want an ER bow.

If You're not a long time player, then you probably don't have heaps of sacs/favs to spare.      
Even then, being a long time player doesn't prevent you from getting screwed by RNG (I've been playing since 1.2 and I have 1 singular R3 Fav bow, bruh.
        Me with my ONE crescent pike, playing since sept 2021.
            Crescent pike is a craftable Weapon thought.

You also get at least one guaranteed billet of each weapon type per Nation
                Not gonna lie, I prioritized the dragon spine spear because I’m vain and wanted rosaria to be a e s t h e t I c
        I’ve been playing since 1.3 and I’ve only gotten one Stringless. Plenty of Bells though lol.
    People usually dont have bucket loads of sac and fav weapons, some cant be bothered to swap everytime, so i think some of teh lesser weapons are useable and comes with the bonus of looking cool/ridicoulus ;)
I mean... all it had to be was a bow version of Lux Sealord and it would've been great.
Fish bow is just worse fav bow which you already get for free so fair but the claymore isn't completely terrible. It's essentially a more burst oriented prototype archaic which while nothing special it can be decentish for the f2p players that got it. Attack% while dendro reactions generally make it less useful, it's not that bad of a stat to have. Bigger thing is more so claymore characters arguably being the weakest weapon type in terms of the units.
    Fav bow is just so contested.. half the bow users want one, lol. I gave the Fish bow to Faruzan. It's alright. And there's also the Twilight something bow that was an event reward.. i gave that to Yelan. Works decently enough as well. I'm not playing the numbers game so whether it's 2% better or worse, i don't care. If the sub stat is right i can dig it.
        It's a lot more than just 2% worse to fav lol. Fav naturally has more er for the substat but the passive further reduces er requirements for the entire team. Meanwhile the passive for the fish bow is near useless. 

Fading twilight on Yelan really isn't great even if you aren't able to give Yelan fav for whatever reason, 3 star bows like recurve bow or slingshot are both better and if you need the er you just run er sands. High refine stringless/mouuns moon can be viable and technically don't even need to be levelled to be used. 

Also there is sac bow which depending on the team and refine can get you an extra skill use every rotation which is quite good. 

The actual niche for getting the fish bow especially having to grind for it with fishing is just so small. You are better off just keeping extra copies of fav bow without refining if you need that many of them.
            The catch is the only fishing weapon were getting it is an actual grind.

Both the fish bow and the pipe have absolutely trivial fish costs.
Iron Sting and the Umbrella are only used as EM stat sticks lmao. Their passives don't do jack shit on the characters using them. 😅 Xiphos' actually has a passive used in combat, and is arguably better on Kazuha than Freedom-Sworn.
    Just saying cause you wrote that the only good alternative to umbrella is Xiphos. It's not, Iron Sting is on par with umbrella. Xiphos is for sure the only one with a useful passive tho.
        I said _actual_ good. Iron Sting is one of the most mid weapons in the game, and was only ever used due to being the only EM sword, other than Freedom-Sworn, for almost 2 years. Iron Sting is passable at best. If we had other EM swords as alternatives, nobody would use it.
    Alhaitham can use both the EM substat and the passive of those two weapons well. They are his top F2P 4-star options. Same for Keqing aggravate.
        I mean. Most event 4* and craftable are a character's BIS "F2P" option because F2P players always have mid options available to them. 🤭 neither weapon are in the top3 best 4* weapons as a whole.
            For those characters, they are, actually. I only said F2P to exclude Wolf-Fang.
    >Iron Sting and the Umbrella are only used as EM stat sticks lmao. Their passives don't do jack shit on the characters using them.

Aggravate Keqing and Spread Al haitham
        Alhaitham would rather have Xiphos' there. Even the new BP sword blows both Umbrella and ISting out of the water. They're still only EM stat sticks in both cases.
            Irrelevant to the point that is being refuted.
                Not really. They're still only being used as EM statsticks.
                    Except they're not just EM stat sticks.

Iron sting

> Dealing Elemental DMG increases all DMG by 6%-12% for 6s. Max 2 stacks. Can only occur once every 1s.

Toukabou Shigure

> After an attack hits opponents, it will inflict an instance of Cursed Parasol upon one of them for 10s. This effect can be triggered once every 15s. If this opponent is defeated during Cursed Parasol's duration, Cursed Parasol's CD will be refreshed immediately. The character wielding this weapon will deal 16-32% more DMG to the opponent affected by Cursed Parasol.

Both weapons provide a DMG bonus buff to the user.

Since both Keqing and Al haitham are Talent multiplier based DPS, they actually can make use of DMG bonuses, thus both characters actually fully utilize the weapon passive.
                        They're pretty much just EM statsticks.
                            No way in hell you actually read and acknowledged the information presented in my reply.
I have the catch got it back when it first came out  umbrella sword looks really good hope they sell it in the jewellery shop there 3 jewellery shop that are totally useless have nothing to sell
    Which shops? If you can't buy from them it means you haven't maxed out that region's sigil tree yet.
Inazuma has the Sakura tree at the shrine, Sumeru's is locked behind the aranara quest and fontaine's is the fountain  in front of the opera house. Once those are maxed out, then you can buy from that region's shop.
        Ohh I haven't sumeru tree and fountain  not planing to max them same with the status of the 7  

I would level the status if they give stamina or 5star weapon  but the current reward worthless to me
So there's a catch to it
I knew something smelt fishy Didn't even it was a fishing weapon, thx for letting me know.
Hopefully when the Hydro Claymore user comes it’ll be useable
I see. What would you say is better for her, fav, this thing or the new BP sword?
    I'd say battle pass sword, but it depends on your artifacts. If your sitting pretty at 70 crit rate and good crit dmg then use the pipe or fav for the extra er.

An r1 bp sword grants 16% dmg and 35% crit rate to your skill and burst.

An r5 fav offers offers 61% er and a universal elemental particule on crit (must be on-feild)

An r5 pipe offers 16% skill crit rate, 45.9% er which increases to 77.9% for 5 seconds after a skill. (45.9% substat + 35% from passive)

If your heavily struggling with crit bp weapon, no crit problems the fav, just shy of the crit goal then pipe
Better than Favge for teamwide utility/more funneling for your main DPS?
    If you need the ER, Fav but for more DMG/Crt then Festering/pipe is what the theory crafters are recommending.
Thank you!
Sweet, thank you. I’ll just rely on my artifacts for damage. Lol.
The pipe may work on someone like Bennett, yeah, but on anyone else? Not really. And I disagree - I think the pipe looks really ugly too. I'll probably (have to) use it on Furina when she comes out, because I don't have Festering Desire (thanks mihoyo for refusing to bring it back...) and I already hate how it will ruin her drip, because it looks so ugly/stupid. And before anybody says anything about it: Yes, I'm well aware of the yokai reference the umbrella has with the eye and tongue, but it still doesn't change the fact that I think that face is really ugly and while an umbrella as a weapon may work in certain stories/games/etc., it doesn't work for me in Genshin IMO. Seeing Shinobu putting that thing away in her Inazuma-style sheath just looks stupid as hell and I just don't like it. Therefore I use/prefer Iron Sting on her, despite it not matching her colors that well.
    If you're concerned about Furina drip then Fav doesn't look too bad on her. Shinobu also works just fine with the dark iron sword (If you didn't feed it into something) Its colors fit her very well and it's only a 24 em decrease.
        "Unfortunately" the elemental skill CR bonus the pipe gives is just too good to ignore for her, so I'll probably stick with the pipe for her. And thanks, I know of the dark iron sword, but I'm fine with Iron Sting on Shinobu.
Oh no...  Is it as much of a time-sink to get as the Catch?
    Not at all. it took me 2 weeks to get the catch. This took me 3 days. If the fish you want aren't showing up, try fast-forwarding time from day to night (and vice versa). If they still aren't there, then just wait a day, or join somebody's world.

    No one mentioned swords
        They're a bot
It's actually very hard to find if you don't already know where to look. I love it when games add very esoteric secrets with actually interesting rewards - and the Dragonspine weapons aren't the best but its still really cool to get them as rewards for exploring the nooks and crannies of the zone. I would just follow the wiki or a youtube guide like [right here.](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Snow-Tombed_Starsilver#Availability) It might take you ages to find otherwise
    The Dragonspine weapons are quite usable on cryo characters, specially the Snowtomb Starsilver for Eula. It matches her kit (physical dmg bonus% and extra instance of dmg from the icicle when the enemy has cryo aplied) and design.
        If by "especially" you mean "only" then sure.

Dragonspine Spear is total ass, and even cryo characters prefer Crescent Pike for a physical build. They both cost the same billets, and R1 Crescent Pike is still better than R5 Dragonspine.

Frostbearer was and will still be ass once we finally get our first ever cryo catalyst(s).
    Is it the one where you need 7 artifacts to open some door?
Don't bother. It's ass. Sea lord is better in an r5 to r5 comparison.
    But sealord is event limited.
        The question is the weapon comparison, not about availability. If you have Sealord good for you but if not than use that Dragonspine claymore for Eula.
            Yeah, but im assuming that the dude doesnt have sealord or r5 based on their comments, so this comment serves no purpose to him.
                I don't think they're trying to be relevant to someone else, it's just pure comparison
        [deleted]
            And the person you replied to asked "Where" and "But it's event limited"

It's easier to assume that they don't have it and answer the question than to outright deny it. They just wanted to know how to get it, not if it's better or not.
                Then why the downvotes before the mention of event limited? The comment chain was making it sound like the one from dragonspine was better and should replace the tuna, so "don't bother, sea lord is better" is a very reasonable thing to say at that moment.
                    Yeah, but the question is "Where is the Craftable Phys Weapon?"

Not "Is it better than Tuna?"

So those who deemed the response as irrelevant, downvoted. Simple as that.
                        And the answer is it doesn't matter where, just keep using the tuna. Totally relevant. Maybe they thought it was the same user with Eula, or at least also letting them know too.

If anything, the OP has the irrelevant response, yet they have 200 upvotes on their reply.
    Wait, how is the sealors better?
        More burst damage
        The Starsilver passive is too bad. Sealord has less base damage but it's bonuses more than make up for it. Especially with refinement, since r5 Starsilver is equally useless.
no leaks pls

    Cinnabar kazuha meta
    I think you might have replied to the wrong comment, as I am very confused lol
Kazuha would use Touka if I didn't have Kuki And a Xiphos Moonlight.  Touka is too beautiful on Kuki, and Xiphos just looks right on him somehow.
    Xiphos passive has way more use on him too as he frequently plays with energy-hungry teams
        Well, he is quite energy hungry himself at c0 so it fits him perfectly
[removed]
Any Gintama fan would find it funny to see a samurai use an Amanto weapon.
Black Iron Sword isn't her best weapon, but it looks really good on Kuki
Same
Khaj just is better as a whole because the team buffs are much superior.
    True but not everyone pulls on weapon banner. New sword is good if you don't have Khaj.
        New sword is also a weapon banner exclusive weapon. And is a 4*, which is arguably harder to confirm. 🤨
            Forgot about that part. Equally true. Somehow I decided to get it for my guaranteed Furina (in case I fail to get signature), and got it on my 13th single pull on weapon banner. Got another Favonius in between, so it was good pull.
                Fav sword is the hardest weapon for me to get. I swear. I had one at R5, but I lost it. Might have "accidentally" fed it to something when I was high. 🤒🤒

But getting the sword on your 13th pull is crazy lucky. It took me 30 or 40 lmao.
                    Yeah. I had 50 pulls saved & ready to waste 30 of them before I hit soft pity on weapon banner (right now at 40 something). I have all my Favonius weapons (claymore, sword, catalyst & bow) at R4. They kind of come in rotation from standard banner & occasional weapon banner pulls (I do at least a 10 pull per patch on weapon banner).
                        I've noticed that a big reason I don't get many Fav swords is cuz the weapon banners it usually pops up in, I have no interest in. 😒😒
                Just an FYI, unless her signature is buffed in beta it is pretty bad. You're better of using Festering Desire (if you have it) or PJC. It really isn't worth pulling for her Sword atm.

Unless you just want it for the aesthetics.
                    The whole reason I pulled on the current banner was this one. The leaks pointed out that signature is bad & so rather than getting a bad 5* later, I tried to get a good 4* now.
            Decided to try to snag it avoiding the 5* and got 2 of this new HP% sword on my 2nd 10-pull. My Furina and my Kirara will be eating well
Sounds good. That way I can keep Xiphos for Kazuha and Khaj for Nilou.
Better than Key and Freedom Sworn? I got R2 from this banner, but not sure what to make of it yet. My Shinobu and Layala run with Freedom Sworn and Key of Khaj Nisut respectively.
    man, DHA is nothing compared to the utility of your 5-star weapon. Since I don't have any premium weapon, I'm using DHA and considered as BIS for my Kuki since she can support my Neuvi for buffing his EM and act as little battery.
Exactly this.  Whenever I see people argue that event weapons should stay limited, I always bring up Cinnabar Spindle.  There's no good reason why they would make Cinnabar Spindle a limited weapon you can never get again, and then give it to Albedo in trials.

I still consider myself to be *insanely* lucky that I started playing Genshin when I did.  I started playing in late 2.2, just before pre-install for 2.3 and just in time to pick up Aloy late.

That event was my first event, and I was thankfully able to get both Cinnabar Spindle and R5 it...even though that poor sword has to live with the trauma of my very, very dumb self planning to run it on Xingqiu cause I had zero idea what I was doing back then (plan was abandoned as swiftly as the character).  It's with Albedo now, so it's being properly being taken care of, as it should be.
    > Whenever I see people argue that event weapons should stay limited

It's such a stupid decision. I have friends that refuse to ever return to the game because of that bs. There's a point where the FOMO keeps players from returning rather than retaining them. 

At the very least (if they cared about player retention), they should have time limited runs where the weapon returns. 

If they were kinder, they would have the weapons become purchasable in the shops and stuff after a certain amount of time (but that's just wishful thinking.
        See that just makes sense to make them purchasable blueprints or something. As much as they do right, exclusive weapons, story quests, and whole areas/maps are just not fun. Just take a year to return it, you get the same experience of some degree of exclusivity without being permanently unable to get Dodoco Tales just bc you discovered Genshin after it was released :(
That is one of the biggest reasons I keep feedbacking Hoyo as to why I'll never care for Albedo and Fischl and pull/play for them. They've locked their content (weapon and/or stories) behind the past so I'll never experience it. Why would I care about someone who's best build (or equivalent) is impossible to get especially when to me, they have no story for me? Albedo's worried they'll destroy Mondstadt one day? He's just a weirdo. Why would I care about this one weird girl who pretends to be friends with us the day we met her while playing TCG? Fischl is a schizophrenic girl in my eye. Hoyo please bring access to their story and/or weapon back you're literally losing money now without them.

Atleast they learned their lesson in Sumeru with Kaveh and let you know his backstory (albeit in a condensed version) in his hangout quest too besides the limited event.
    [deleted]
        > They've locked their content (weapon and**/or stories)**
            Okay, but the sentence immediately after that one makes it pretty clear that they think it's an optimal weapon for her
                no it doesnt? what sentence are u talking about 😭
        Yep. Fischl is perfectly fine using Stringless or even a worse bow.

Albedo was using Harbinger of Dawn for a YEAR and doing pretty great without his even better sword.
    Isn’t fischl’s weapon on banner rn? Or did she have another one?
        Tbh Mitternacht Waltz isn’t even her best 4* weapon. It’s decent for on-field physical Fischl, but for any other Fischl build you’d much rather run Stringless.

Of course if you want to talk true bis weapon it’s Polar Star.
            Meanwhile I run her with Alley Hunter (her BIS off-field DPS), which also meshes perfectly with her alt outfit.
            Surely stringless is, at least for aggravate teams?
                Stringless is definitely her best 4 star in aggravate.
        They meant her story which was a limited time event.
            Are they referring to the 2.8 GAA Fischl story?
                Probably 1.1 Unreconciled Stars (Scaramouche was also introduced there, and it's where Fischl and Mona first became friends). But Fischl's mind palace story has the same issue.
                    Ooohh I’ll have to YouTube then lmao
        Fischls weapon is Alley Hunter wdym
    I don't get why they don't rerun events. It's extra content for (almost) no effort.
        Apparently HSR allows you to play certain older events from a menu after they're done running. So they definitely know it's something players want.
            I think just the ones rhat unlock new areas, though (at least so far).  Genshin just doesn't have nee area events be limited time at all.
                Golden Apple Archipelago and the Veluriyam Mirage which were designed to be specifically limited. (There was also a separate Enkanomiya for the Bokosu Box due to slightly altered environments and event mechanics despite being the same map that the user can swap between the original and the event version.)
                    Yes, absolutely.  (I've been playing since 2.0 so I played all that except gaa ).  But those were temporary locations, not permanent map spots with quests wired up to thm,, like the museum and market.

Genshin has locationa that open uo with non-archon quests too -- ekanomia, chasm, dragonspine,  But the quests involved are officially permanent, woth the extra event quest/rewards associated taked on (and including story that's l9st after the event ends).  HSR still has the extra rewards, but the story for the location quest ends up all inside the premanent event, not half and half. (the ekanomia event location is a weird outlier there).
    Fischl’s weapon is literally on the banner right now (and it’s useless of her anyways).
        Stringless is best for her, right?
            Yeah for aggravate it's good, still think any crit 5 star bow is better though
            Not necessarily since she has a lot of good options but it's pretty good on her.
            For Aggravate it’s her best 4*, generic Crit bows are better for Taser or other teams.
                I see. I guess my perspective was skewed since I play her with Keqing.
                Doesn't she also really like Alley Hunter?
                    Alley hunter is technically better, though the difference is small in aggravate teams.

People just suggest stringless more frequently because it's on banners more and more more likely you have refines on it.
        I guess you never heard about physical fischl
            Yeah but she wants Rust.
    Trust in N. I really hope she appears in person in the future so that we can go back and play lost events, and/or buy weapons supposedly lost to new players. Klee's signature Dodoco Tales is also event-locked, IIRC.
    They need to add event quests to a playable archive. I don't care about the primos or mora or rewards, obviously those would be limited. They made the game so heavily centered around story and lore, and then just make some of their best content evaporate after a few weeks.

I mean jeezus, you can't even play through permanent quests again and get the full experience of the story, see the cutscenes, or even see the characters interacting visually while they give their lines. (I'd love to be able to re-play world quests again too, like the quest line with Jeht was so good). They're not afraid of re-played content in general, the weekly bosses are a major event we re-experience and somehow that didn't ruin the game.

(Side gripe I wish they'd make character gameplay trials permanent in the character archive. I mean you DO want me to spend several months jonesing for a 5-star, right? How would I care if I've never played them and don't remember the 4 seconds of play from their story quest I completed 7 months ago and can never re-play? Also side side gripe why can we view characters we don't own in the character archive--which is a good thing--but can't view weapons we don't own in the weapon archive? It's such a basic thing to make known what weapons exist in the game so you can plan your account.)
    Yikes
    This is such weird logic to me, I can agree having Albedo's weapon locked behind FOMO is stupid af but if you're curious enough about the characters why not just go on YT and watch some playthroughs of the events they were relevant in? It sucks you have to resort to watching old content on YT but at least you have that available to you, if you're going to tell me you don't want to do that (my words, not yours) JUST because you have to goto YT to watch past stuff that's on you but you can't entirely complain you don't have access to any story or background for them.

This reply is also longer than I even intended for it to be or else i'd actually tell you why you're wrong about Albedo and Fischl but you're entitled to your own opinion on a character but it's weird to me to just dismiss them if you won't even attempt to look anything up about their character (if you even care to) instead of just complaining about it.
        roast their ass hell yeah
Albedo has been gone for 1 year so far. Been waiting for him since 3.1 . Hoyo is just trolling with everything regarding that character
    Hasn’t *quite* been a year yet (5 days until it is… same amount of time since the last limited 5 star waifu was released…)

I don’t know why Hoyoverse is so insistent on making Mond characters wait a long time for reruns.
Why they dont do that yet is beyond me
    FOMO. If there are weapons you'll never gain access to in game if you don't play, then you will always play so you don't miss out. If they make it available in any other format, the strategy isn't effective.
        Having to check back in each month or two and pull for more glitter locks people in to keep playing, and is still a huge incentive to actually be there for the event to skip all that.
Festering is going to be F2P BiS for Furina.
    Isn't pipe better?
        No
            Ah, you're right. I'll better give Festering Desire to her and leave the pipe for DMC.
yeah well festering desires bis character isn't out yet so...
    She will be out next patch i meant bis 4star
    I doubt it will be her BiS, they will prob tweak the beta stats on the new weapon

What is this copium downvotes, you really think festering desire will be better than the gacha weapon? Are you dumb?
        It's BiS aside from her signature.

The signature is still best, but Festering Desire is significantly above every other option, even other 5 star weapons.
Festering is a really good F2P on a lot of characters, and is Furina's BIS 4*. Lmao. The slander is real. Also, Festering is better than every weapon OP posted. 💀
    You're not getting my point,first of all furina's kit isn't finalized yet so her 4 star bis can change and u yourself said that it's good(not the best) on a lot of characters but cinnabar is bis so missing cinnabar is a bigger loss than festering unless u never plan on pulling albedo
        It's not going to change that drastically. Festering _will_ be the BIS 4* on Furina. 😅
            The best part is it will not only be her 4star bis but might as well be overall 2nd bis wep or... Even the 1st bis itself over her Sig(depending cases/situation)
                With characters like Furina and Yelan, I just typically prefer ER weapons. It's easy to gain plenty of HP in substats, but ER is always harder to get.
            She's an archon so we never know.Also still festering isn't bis for furina,her 5 star weapon will be her real bis.Meanwhile for albedo,cinnabar is his bis even compared to other 5 stars
                Lmao. Nobody else in beta ever had their beta best in slot options change completely. So, there's that. And, sure, her 5* will be really good. But Furina is also still one of the most energy hungry characters in the game, who also has a skill that doesn't produce many particles through the duration, which is why ER weapons like Fav and Festering will likely just be easier, and better, to use in practice. Part of why Baizhu's weapon, while technically being his BIS, is so fucking mid. Favonius Codex is just better in actual gameplay. Kind of similar to Yelan, too. Sure, Aqua is good, but ER weapons are so much better.
                    ER is not the reason why Baizhu’s weapon isn’t worth it (it’s not even “just mid” in him since it is literally his BiS).

Jadefall’s passive at R1 *actually restores more energy and heals more than R5 Prototype Amber for Baizhu because of the way the passive works*. R5 PAmber gives 18 energy in one burst, R1 Jadefall gives 22.5 energy in one burst. In practice and on paper, no weapon is better than Jadefall on Baizhu specifically, unless you want to battery the team (then you use Favonius but even then Jadefall is still better for Baizhu’s personal energy gain).

Jadefall is literally a better PAmber on Baizhu; no arguments whatsoever because it’s literally the same passive and stats but higher.

You can’t really say Fav is better in this case since that’s a team dependent thing instead of being a Baizhu dependent thing; if the rest of your team has no energy issues then Jadefall is still best.

The real reason Jadefall is “mid” in general is that it’s *ONLY* BiS for Baizhu. Nobody else gets good mileage out of it.
                        Fav is just better lmao.
                    Still my point stands that her bis is her 5 star weapon.
                        If you have over 200% ER on her without an ER weapon, sure! But you probably won't have 40k HP. 😅 Her weapon is one of the biggest baits for whales/simps that I've ever seen.
                Honestly Festering is looking stronger than her Sig rn

Sure unless further changes turn tides that's not in our hands,but as of now Festering is in the favor
                I mean, of course Furina's BiS will be her signature weapon. Albedo's 5* signature doesn't even exist.


If you made it so Furina's 5* sig also didn't exist, then that means (at her current stats in double Hydro), Festering IS her BiS.


Hoyo can still release Albedo's sig just like they did with Venti's though/copium
            Isnt the new battle pass sword better at R5? Gives the same damage percent ( 32) and gives 4 more crit rate and has crit rate substat. Oh and it buffs burst as well. Its not f2p though
                Maybe, but the sword is third on my list of new Battle Pass weapons to get to R5. First is the Spear, then the Jade, and then the sword. My EM Raiden wants that 240 EM.
>!its very good for furina only 20% worse than her own 5 star weapon!<
    >!I'd say it's better than her sig if she's a solo hydro!<
Very understandable, we don't have hp sword too which is a bummer, hoyo fear nilou.
    Check current weapon banner.
        Event/fishing weapons.
Sadly, but Festering is no one’s bis only in current version.
Fav is always good but fleuve is literally festering desire cope, I think it's strictly worse
Fleuve is copium
I think Genshin is the samsara spin-off of Impact that got more popular than they expected and so doesn’t get the same resources, sadly. :/ I could be wrong, but considering the differences between Genshin and both Honkai games, it’s the impression I get.
    Bruh, its simple; Genshin gets the money, Honkai gets the love.
>but Favonious Bow exist and everyone get that one for free plus

You get 1 Fav bow for free.

There's quite a few Bow Users in the game who want an ER bow.

If You're not a long time player, then you probably don't have heaps of sacs/favs to spare.      
Even then, being a long time player doesn't prevent you from getting screwed by RNG (I've been playing since 1.2 and I have 1 singular R3 Fav bow, bruh.
    Me with my ONE crescent pike, playing since sept 2021.
        Crescent pike is a craftable Weapon thought.

You also get at least one guaranteed billet of each weapon type per Nation
            Not gonna lie, I prioritized the dragon spine spear because I’m vain and wanted rosaria to be a e s t h e t I c
    I’ve been playing since 1.3 and I’ve only gotten one Stringless. Plenty of Bells though lol.
People usually dont have bucket loads of sac and fav weapons, some cant be bothered to swap everytime, so i think some of teh lesser weapons are useable and comes with the bonus of looking cool/ridicoulus ;)
Fav bow is just so contested.. half the bow users want one, lol. I gave the Fish bow to Faruzan. It's alright. And there's also the Twilight something bow that was an event reward.. i gave that to Yelan. Works decently enough as well. I'm not playing the numbers game so whether it's 2% better or worse, i don't care. If the sub stat is right i can dig it.
    It's a lot more than just 2% worse to fav lol. Fav naturally has more er for the substat but the passive further reduces er requirements for the entire team. Meanwhile the passive for the fish bow is near useless. 

Fading twilight on Yelan really isn't great even if you aren't able to give Yelan fav for whatever reason, 3 star bows like recurve bow or slingshot are both better and if you need the er you just run er sands. High refine stringless/mouuns moon can be viable and technically don't even need to be levelled to be used. 

Also there is sac bow which depending on the team and refine can get you an extra skill use every rotation which is quite good. 

The actual niche for getting the fish bow especially having to grind for it with fishing is just so small. You are better off just keeping extra copies of fav bow without refining if you need that many of them.
        The catch is the only fishing weapon were getting it is an actual grind.

Both the fish bow and the pipe have absolutely trivial fish costs.
Just saying cause you wrote that the only good alternative to umbrella is Xiphos. It's not, Iron Sting is on par with umbrella. Xiphos is for sure the only one with a useful passive tho.
    I said _actual_ good. Iron Sting is one of the most mid weapons in the game, and was only ever used due to being the only EM sword, other than Freedom-Sworn, for almost 2 years. Iron Sting is passable at best. If we had other EM swords as alternatives, nobody would use it.
Alhaitham can use both the EM substat and the passive of those two weapons well. They are his top F2P 4-star options. Same for Keqing aggravate.
    I mean. Most event 4* and craftable are a character's BIS "F2P" option because F2P players always have mid options available to them. 🤭 neither weapon are in the top3 best 4* weapons as a whole.
        For those characters, they are, actually. I only said F2P to exclude Wolf-Fang.
>Iron Sting and the Umbrella are only used as EM stat sticks lmao. Their passives don't do jack shit on the characters using them.

Aggravate Keqing and Spread Al haitham
    Alhaitham would rather have Xiphos' there. Even the new BP sword blows both Umbrella and ISting out of the water. They're still only EM stat sticks in both cases.
        Irrelevant to the point that is being refuted.
            Not really. They're still only being used as EM statsticks.
                Except they're not just EM stat sticks.

Which shops? If you can't buy from them it means you haven't maxed out that region's sigil tree yet.
Inazuma has the Sakura tree at the shrine, Sumeru's is locked behind the aranara quest and fontaine's is the fountain  in front of the opera house. Once those are maxed out, then you can buy from that region's shop.
    Ohh I haven't sumeru tree and fountain  not planing to max them same with the status of the 7  

I would level the status if they give stamina or 5star weapon  but the current reward worthless to me
I'd say battle pass sword, but it depends on your artifacts. If your sitting pretty at 70 crit rate and good crit dmg then use the pipe or fav for the extra er.

An r1 bp sword grants 16% dmg and 35% crit rate to your skill and burst.

An r5 fav offers offers 61% er and a universal elemental particule on crit (must be on-feild)

An r5 pipe offers 16% skill crit rate, 45.9% er which increases to 77.9% for 5 seconds after a skill. (45.9% substat + 35% from passive)

If your heavily struggling with crit bp weapon, no crit problems the fav, just shy of the crit goal then pipe
If you need the ER, Fav but for more DMG/Crt then Festering/pipe is what the theory crafters are recommending.
If you're concerned about Furina drip then Fav doesn't look too bad on her. Shinobu also works just fine with the dark iron sword (If you didn't feed it into something) Its colors fit her very well and it's only a 24 em decrease.
    "Unfortunately" the elemental skill CR bonus the pipe gives is just too good to ignore for her, so I'll probably stick with the pipe for her. And thanks, I know of the dark iron sword, but I'm fine with Iron Sting on Shinobu.
Not at all. it took me 2 weeks to get the catch. This took me 3 days. If the fish you want aren't showing up, try fast-forwarding time from day to night (and vice versa). If they still aren't there, then just wait a day, or join somebody's world.
No one mentioned swords
    They're a bot
The Dragonspine weapons are quite usable on cryo characters, specially the Snowtomb Starsilver for Eula. It matches her kit (physical dmg bonus% and extra instance of dmg from the icicle when the enemy has cryo aplied) and design.
    If by "especially" you mean "only" then sure.

Dragonspine Spear is total ass, and even cryo characters prefer Crescent Pike for a physical build. They both cost the same billets, and R1 Crescent Pike is still better than R5 Dragonspine.

Frostbearer was and will still be ass once we finally get our first ever cryo catalyst(s).
Is it the one where you need 7 artifacts to open some door?
But sealord is event limited.
    The question is the weapon comparison, not about availability. If you have Sealord good for you but if not than use that Dragonspine claymore for Eula.
        Yeah, but im assuming that the dude doesnt have sealord or r5 based on their comments, so this comment serves no purpose to him.
            I don't think they're trying to be relevant to someone else, it's just pure comparison
    [deleted]
        And the person you replied to asked "Where" and "But it's event limited"

It's easier to assume that they don't have it and answer the question than to outright deny it. They just wanted to know how to get it, not if it's better or not.
            Then why the downvotes before the mention of event limited? The comment chain was making it sound like the one from dragonspine was better and should replace the tuna, so "don't bother, sea lord is better" is a very reasonable thing to say at that moment.
                Yeah, but the question is "Where is the Craftable Phys Weapon?"

Not "Is it better than Tuna?"

So those who deemed the response as irrelevant, downvoted. Simple as that.
                    And the answer is it doesn't matter where, just keep using the tuna. Totally relevant. Maybe they thought it was the same user with Eula, or at least also letting them know too.

If anything, the OP has the irrelevant response, yet they have 200 upvotes on their reply.
Wait, how is the sealors better?
    More burst damage
    The Starsilver passive is too bad. Sealord has less base damage but it's bonuses more than make up for it. Especially with refinement, since r5 Starsilver is equally useless.
Cinnabar kazuha meta
I think you might have replied to the wrong comment, as I am very confused lol
Xiphos passive has way more use on him too as he frequently plays with energy-hungry teams
    Well, he is quite energy hungry himself at c0 so it fits him perfectly
True but not everyone pulls on weapon banner. New sword is good if you don't have Khaj.
    New sword is also a weapon banner exclusive weapon. And is a 4*, which is arguably harder to confirm. 🤨
        Forgot about that part. Equally true. Somehow I decided to get it for my guaranteed Furina (in case I fail to get signature), and got it on my 13th single pull on weapon banner. Got another Favonius in between, so it was good pull.
            Fav sword is the hardest weapon for me to get. I swear. I had one at R5, but I lost it. Might have "accidentally" fed it to something when I was high. 🤒🤒

But getting the sword on your 13th pull is crazy lucky. It took me 30 or 40 lmao.
                Yeah. I had 50 pulls saved & ready to waste 30 of them before I hit soft pity on weapon banner (right now at 40 something). I have all my Favonius weapons (claymore, sword, catalyst & bow) at R4. They kind of come in rotation from standard banner & occasional weapon banner pulls (I do at least a 10 pull per patch on weapon banner).
                    I've noticed that a big reason I don't get many Fav swords is cuz the weapon banners it usually pops up in, I have no interest in. 😒😒
            Just an FYI, unless her signature is buffed in beta it is pretty bad. You're better of using Festering Desire (if you have it) or PJC. It really isn't worth pulling for her Sword atm.

Unless you just want it for the aesthetics.
                The whole reason I pulled on the current banner was this one. The leaks pointed out that signature is bad & so rather than getting a bad 5* later, I tried to get a good 4* now.
        Decided to try to snag it avoiding the 5* and got 2 of this new HP% sword on my 2nd 10-pull. My Furina and my Kirara will be eating well
man, DHA is nothing compared to the utility of your 5-star weapon. Since I don't have any premium weapon, I'm using DHA and considered as BIS for my Kuki since she can support my Neuvi for buffing his EM and act as little battery.
> Whenever I see people argue that event weapons should stay limited

It's such a stupid decision. I have friends that refuse to ever return to the game because of that bs. There's a point where the FOMO keeps players from returning rather than retaining them. 

At the very least (if they cared about player retention), they should have time limited runs where the weapon returns. 

If they were kinder, they would have the weapons become purchasable in the shops and stuff after a certain amount of time (but that's just wishful thinking.
    See that just makes sense to make them purchasable blueprints or something. As much as they do right, exclusive weapons, story quests, and whole areas/maps are just not fun. Just take a year to return it, you get the same experience of some degree of exclusivity without being permanently unable to get Dodoco Tales just bc you discovered Genshin after it was released :(
[deleted]
    > They've locked their content (weapon and**/or stories)**
        Okay, but the sentence immediately after that one makes it pretty clear that they think it's an optimal weapon for her
            no it doesnt? what sentence are u talking about 😭
    Yep. Fischl is perfectly fine using Stringless or even a worse bow.

Albedo was using Harbinger of Dawn for a YEAR and doing pretty great without his even better sword.
Isn’t fischl’s weapon on banner rn? Or did she have another one?
    Tbh Mitternacht Waltz isn’t even her best 4* weapon. It’s decent for on-field physical Fischl, but for any other Fischl build you’d much rather run Stringless.

Of course if you want to talk true bis weapon it’s Polar Star.
        Meanwhile I run her with Alley Hunter (her BIS off-field DPS), which also meshes perfectly with her alt outfit.
        Surely stringless is, at least for aggravate teams?
            Stringless is definitely her best 4 star in aggravate.
    They meant her story which was a limited time event.
        Are they referring to the 2.8 GAA Fischl story?
            Probably 1.1 Unreconciled Stars (Scaramouche was also introduced there, and it's where Fischl and Mona first became friends). But Fischl's mind palace story has the same issue.
                Ooohh I’ll have to YouTube then lmao
    Fischls weapon is Alley Hunter wdym
I don't get why they don't rerun events. It's extra content for (almost) no effort.
    Apparently HSR allows you to play certain older events from a menu after they're done running. So they definitely know it's something players want.
        I think just the ones rhat unlock new areas, though (at least so far).  Genshin just doesn't have nee area events be limited time at all.
            Golden Apple Archipelago and the Veluriyam Mirage which were designed to be specifically limited. (There was also a separate Enkanomiya for the Bokosu Box due to slightly altered environments and event mechanics despite being the same map that the user can swap between the original and the event version.)
                Yes, absolutely.  (I've been playing since 2.0 so I played all that except gaa ).  But those were temporary locations, not permanent map spots with quests wired up to thm,, like the museum and market.

Genshin has locationa that open uo with non-archon quests too -- ekanomia, chasm, dragonspine,  But the quests involved are officially permanent, woth the extra event quest/rewards associated taked on (and including story that's l9st after the event ends).  HSR still has the extra rewards, but the story for the location quest ends up all inside the premanent event, not half and half. (the ekanomia event location is a weird outlier there).
Fischl’s weapon is literally on the banner right now (and it’s useless of her anyways).
    Stringless is best for her, right?
        Yeah for aggravate it's good, still think any crit 5 star bow is better though
        Not necessarily since she has a lot of good options but it's pretty good on her.
        For Aggravate it’s her best 4*, generic Crit bows are better for Taser or other teams.
            I see. I guess my perspective was skewed since I play her with Keqing.
            Doesn't she also really like Alley Hunter?
                Alley hunter is technically better, though the difference is small in aggravate teams.

People just suggest stringless more frequently because it's on banners more and more more likely you have refines on it.
    I guess you never heard about physical fischl
        Yeah but she wants Rust.
Trust in N. I really hope she appears in person in the future so that we can go back and play lost events, and/or buy weapons supposedly lost to new players. Klee's signature Dodoco Tales is also event-locked, IIRC.
They need to add event quests to a playable archive. I don't care about the primos or mora or rewards, obviously those would be limited. They made the game so heavily centered around story and lore, and then just make some of their best content evaporate after a few weeks.

I mean jeezus, you can't even play through permanent quests again and get the full experience of the story, see the cutscenes, or even see the characters interacting visually while they give their lines. (I'd love to be able to re-play world quests again too, like the quest line with Jeht was so good). They're not afraid of re-played content in general, the weekly bosses are a major event we re-experience and somehow that didn't ruin the game.

(Side gripe I wish they'd make character gameplay trials permanent in the character archive. I mean you DO want me to spend several months jonesing for a 5-star, right? How would I care if I've never played them and don't remember the 4 seconds of play from their story quest I completed 7 months ago and can never re-play? Also side side gripe why can we view characters we don't own in the character archive--which is a good thing--but can't view weapons we don't own in the weapon archive? It's such a basic thing to make known what weapons exist in the game so you can plan your account.)
Yikes
This is such weird logic to me, I can agree having Albedo's weapon locked behind FOMO is stupid af but if you're curious enough about the characters why not just go on YT and watch some playthroughs of the events they were relevant in? It sucks you have to resort to watching old content on YT but at least you have that available to you, if you're going to tell me you don't want to do that (my words, not yours) JUST because you have to goto YT to watch past stuff that's on you but you can't entirely complain you don't have access to any story or background for them.

This reply is also longer than I even intended for it to be or else i'd actually tell you why you're wrong about Albedo and Fischl but you're entitled to your own opinion on a character but it's weird to me to just dismiss them if you won't even attempt to look anything up about their character (if you even care to) instead of just complaining about it.
    roast their ass hell yeah
Hasn’t *quite* been a year yet (5 days until it is… same amount of time since the last limited 5 star waifu was released…)

I don’t know why Hoyoverse is so insistent on making Mond characters wait a long time for reruns.
FOMO. If there are weapons you'll never gain access to in game if you don't play, then you will always play so you don't miss out. If they make it available in any other format, the strategy isn't effective.
    Having to check back in each month or two and pull for more glitter locks people in to keep playing, and is still a huge incentive to actually be there for the event to skip all that.
Isn't pipe better?
    No
        Ah, you're right. I'll better give Festering Desire to her and leave the pipe for DMC.
She will be out next patch i meant bis 4star
I doubt it will be her BiS, they will prob tweak the beta stats on the new weapon

What is this copium downvotes, you really think festering desire will be better than the gacha weapon? Are you dumb?
    It's BiS aside from her signature.

The signature is still best, but Festering Desire is significantly above every other option, even other 5 star weapons.
You're not getting my point,first of all furina's kit isn't finalized yet so her 4 star bis can change and u yourself said that it's good(not the best) on a lot of characters but cinnabar is bis so missing cinnabar is a bigger loss than festering unless u never plan on pulling albedo
    It's not going to change that drastically. Festering _will_ be the BIS 4* on Furina. 😅
        The best part is it will not only be her 4star bis but might as well be overall 2nd bis wep or... Even the 1st bis itself over her Sig(depending cases/situation)
            With characters like Furina and Yelan, I just typically prefer ER weapons. It's easy to gain plenty of HP in substats, but ER is always harder to get.
        She's an archon so we never know.Also still festering isn't bis for furina,her 5 star weapon will be her real bis.Meanwhile for albedo,cinnabar is his bis even compared to other 5 stars
            Lmao. Nobody else in beta ever had their beta best in slot options change completely. So, there's that. And, sure, her 5* will be really good. But Furina is also still one of the most energy hungry characters in the game, who also has a skill that doesn't produce many particles through the duration, which is why ER weapons like Fav and Festering will likely just be easier, and better, to use in practice. Part of why Baizhu's weapon, while technically being his BIS, is so fucking mid. Favonius Codex is just better in actual gameplay. Kind of similar to Yelan, too. Sure, Aqua is good, but ER weapons are so much better.
                ER is not the reason why Baizhu’s weapon isn’t worth it (it’s not even “just mid” in him since it is literally his BiS).

Jadefall’s passive at R1 *actually restores more energy and heals more than R5 Prototype Amber for Baizhu because of the way the passive works*. R5 PAmber gives 18 energy in one burst, R1 Jadefall gives 22.5 energy in one burst. In practice and on paper, no weapon is better than Jadefall on Baizhu specifically, unless you want to battery the team (then you use Favonius but even then Jadefall is still better for Baizhu’s personal energy gain).

Jadefall is literally a better PAmber on Baizhu; no arguments whatsoever because it’s literally the same passive and stats but higher.

You can’t really say Fav is better in this case since that’s a team dependent thing instead of being a Baizhu dependent thing; if the rest of your team has no energy issues then Jadefall is still best.

The real reason Jadefall is “mid” in general is that it’s *ONLY* BiS for Baizhu. Nobody else gets good mileage out of it.
                    Fav is just better lmao.
                Still my point stands that her bis is her 5 star weapon.
                    If you have over 200% ER on her without an ER weapon, sure! But you probably won't have 40k HP. 😅 Her weapon is one of the biggest baits for whales/simps that I've ever seen.
            Honestly Festering is looking stronger than her Sig rn

Sure unless further changes turn tides that's not in our hands,but as of now Festering is in the favor
            I mean, of course Furina's BiS will be her signature weapon. Albedo's 5* signature doesn't even exist.


If you made it so Furina's 5* sig also didn't exist, then that means (at her current stats in double Hydro), Festering IS her BiS.


Hoyo can still release Albedo's sig just like they did with Venti's though/copium
        Isnt the new battle pass sword better at R5? Gives the same damage percent ( 32) and gives 4 more crit rate and has crit rate substat. Oh and it buffs burst as well. Its not f2p though
            Maybe, but the sword is third on my list of new Battle Pass weapons to get to R5. First is the Spear, then the Jade, and then the sword. My EM Raiden wants that 240 EM.
>!I'd say it's better than her sig if she's a solo hydro!<

I’ve been playing since 1.3 and I’ve only gotten one Stringless. Plenty of Bells though lol.
It's a lot more than just 2% worse to fav lol. Fav naturally has more er for the substat but the passive further reduces er requirements for the entire team. Meanwhile the passive for the fish bow is near useless. 

Fading twilight on Yelan really isn't great even if you aren't able to give Yelan fav for whatever reason, 3 star bows like recurve bow or slingshot are both better and if you need the er you just run er sands. High refine stringless/mouuns moon can be viable and technically don't even need to be levelled to be used. 

Also there is sac bow which depending on the team and refine can get you an extra skill use every rotation which is quite good. 

The actual niche for getting the fish bow especially having to grind for it with fishing is just so small. You are better off just keeping extra copies of fav bow without refining if you need that many of them.
    The catch is the only fishing weapon were getting it is an actual grind.

Both the fish bow and the pipe have absolutely trivial fish costs.
I said _actual_ good. Iron Sting is one of the most mid weapons in the game, and was only ever used due to being the only EM sword, other than Freedom-Sworn, for almost 2 years. Iron Sting is passable at best. If we had other EM swords as alternatives, nobody would use it.

They kind of come in rotation from standard banner & occasional weapon banner pulls (I do at least a 10 pull per patch on weapon banner).
                I've noticed that a big reason I don't get many Fav swords is cuz the weapon banners it usually pops up in, I have no interest in. 😒😒
        Just an FYI, unless her signature is buffed in beta it is pretty bad. You're better of using Festering Desire (if you have it) or PJC. It really isn't worth pulling for her Sword atm.

Unless you just want it for the aesthetics.
            The whole reason I pulled on the current banner was this one. The leaks pointed out that signature is bad & so rather than getting a bad 5* later, I tried to get a good 4* now.
    Decided to try to snag it avoiding the 5* and got 2 of this new HP% sword on my 2nd 10-pull. My Furina and my Kirara will be eating well
See that just makes sense to make them purchasable blueprints or something. As much as they do right, exclusive weapons, story quests, and whole areas/maps are just not fun. Just take a year to return it, you get the same experience of some degree of exclusivity without being permanently unable to get Dodoco Tales just bc you discovered Genshin after it was released :(
> They've locked their content (weapon and**/or stories)**
    Okay, but the sentence immediately after that one makes it pretty clear that they think it's an optimal weapon for her
        no it doesnt? what sentence are u talking about 😭
Yep. Fischl is perfectly fine using Stringless or even a worse bow.

Albedo was using Harbinger of Dawn for a YEAR and doing pretty great without his even better sword.
Tbh Mitternacht Waltz isn’t even her best 4* weapon. It’s decent for on-field physical Fischl, but for any other Fischl build you’d much rather run Stringless.

Of course if you want to talk true bis weapon it’s Polar Star.
    Meanwhile I run her with Alley Hunter (her BIS off-field DPS), which also meshes perfectly with her alt outfit.
    Surely stringless is, at least for aggravate teams?
        Stringless is definitely her best 4 star in aggravate.
They meant her story which was a limited time event.
    Are they referring to the 2.8 GAA Fischl story?
        Probably 1.1 Unreconciled Stars (Scaramouche was also introduced there, and it's where Fischl and Mona first became friends). But Fischl's mind palace story has the same issue.
            Ooohh I’ll have to YouTube then lmao
Fischls weapon is Alley Hunter wdym
Apparently HSR allows you to play certain older events from a menu after they're done running. So they definitely know it's something players want.
    I think just the ones rhat unlock new areas, though (at least so far).  Genshin just doesn't have nee area events be limited time at all.
        Golden Apple Archipelago and the Veluriyam Mirage which were designed to be specifically limited. (There was also a separate Enkanomiya for the Bokosu Box due to slightly altered environments and event mechanics despite being the same map that the user can swap between the original and the event version.)
            Yes, absolutely.  (I've been playing since 2.0 so I played all that except gaa ).  But those were temporary locations, not permanent map spots with quests wired up to thm,, like the museum and market.

Genshin has locationa that open uo with non-archon quests too -- ekanomia, chasm, dragonspine,  But the quests involved are officially permanent, woth the extra event quest/rewards associated taked on (and including story that's l9st after the event ends).  HSR still has the extra rewards, but the story for the location quest ends up all inside the premanent event, not half and half. (the ekanomia event location is a weird outlier there).
Stringless is best for her, right?
    Yeah for aggravate it's good, still think any crit 5 star bow is better though
    Not necessarily since she has a lot of good options but it's pretty good on her.
    For Aggravate it’s her best 4*, generic Crit bows are better for Taser or other teams.
        I see. I guess my perspective was skewed since I play her with Keqing.
        Doesn't she also really like Alley Hunter?
            Alley hunter is technically better, though the difference is small in aggravate teams.

People just suggest stringless more frequently because it's on banners more and more more likely you have refines on it.
I guess you never heard about physical fischl
    Yeah but she wants Rust.
roast their ass hell yeah
Having to check back in each month or two and pull for more glitter locks people in to keep playing, and is still a huge incentive to actually be there for the event to skip all that.
No
    Ah, you're right. I'll better give Festering Desire to her and leave the pipe for DMC.
It's BiS aside from her signature.

The signature is still best, but Festering Desire is significantly above every other option, even other 5 star weapons.
It's not going to change that drastically. Festering _will_ be the BIS 4* on Furina. 😅
    The best part is it will not only be her 4star bis but might as well be overall 2nd bis wep or... Even the 1st bis itself over her Sig(depending cases/situation)
        With characters like Furina and Yelan, I just typically prefer ER weapons. It's easy to gain plenty of HP in substats, but ER is always harder to get.
    She's an archon so we never know.Also still festering isn't bis for furina,her 5 star weapon will be her real bis.Meanwhile for albedo,cinnabar is his bis even compared to other 5 stars
        Lmao. Nobody else in beta ever had their beta best in slot options change completely. So, there's that. And, sure, her 5* will be really good. But Furina is also still one of the most energy hungry characters in the game, who also has a skill that doesn't produce many particles through the duration, which is why ER weapons like Fav and Festering will likely just be easier, and better, to use in practice. Part of why Baizhu's weapon, while technically being his BIS, is so fucking mid. Favonius Codex is just better in actual gameplay. Kind of similar to Yelan, too. Sure, Aqua is good, but ER weapons are so much better.
            ER is not the reason why Baizhu’s weapon isn’t worth it (it’s not even “just mid” in him since it is literally his BiS).

Jadefall’s passive at R1 *actually restores more energy and heals more than R5 Prototype Amber for Baizhu because of the way the passive works*. R5 PAmber gives 18 energy in one burst, R1 Jadefall gives 22.5 energy in one burst. In practice and on paper, no weapon is better than Jadefall on Baizhu specifically, unless you want to battery the team (then you use Favonius but even then Jadefall is still better for Baizhu’s personal energy gain).

Jadefall is literally a better PAmber on Baizhu; no arguments whatsoever because it’s literally the same passive and stats but higher.

You can’t really say Fav is better in this case since that’s a team dependent thing instead of being a Baizhu dependent thing; if the rest of your team has no energy issues then Jadefall is still best.

The real reason Jadefall is “mid” in general is that it’s *ONLY* BiS for Baizhu. Nobody else gets good mileage out of it.
                Fav is just better lmao.
            Still my point stands that her bis is her 5 star weapon.
                If you have over 200% ER on her without an ER weapon, sure! But you probably won't have 40k HP. 😅 Her weapon is one of the biggest baits for whales/simps that I've ever seen.
        Honestly Festering is looking stronger than her Sig rn

Sure unless further changes turn tides that's not in our hands,but as of now Festering is in the favor
        I mean, of course Furina's BiS will be her signature weapon. Albedo's 5* signature doesn't even exist.


If you made it so Furina's 5* sig also didn't exist, then that means (at her current stats in double Hydro), Festering IS her BiS.


Hoyo can still release Albedo's sig just like they did with Venti's though/copium
    Isnt the new battle pass sword better at R5? Gives the same damage percent ( 32) and gives 4 more crit rate and has crit rate substat. Oh and it buffs burst as well. Its not f2p though
        Maybe, but the sword is third on my list of new Battle Pass weapons to get to R5. First is the Spear, then the Jade, and then the sword. My EM Raiden wants that 240 EM.
Event/fishing weapons.
Crescent pike is a craftable Weapon thought.

You also get at least one guaranteed billet of each weapon type per Nation
    Not gonna lie, I prioritized the dragon spine spear because I’m vain and wanted rosaria to be a e s t h e t I c
The catch is the only fishing weapon were getting it is an actual grind.

Both the fish bow and the pipe have absolutely trivial fish costs.
For those characters, they are, actually. I only said F2P to exclude Wolf-Fang.
Irrelevant to the point that is being refuted.
    Not really. They're still only being used as EM statsticks.
        Except they're not just EM stat sticks.

Iron sting

> Dealing Elemental DMG increases all DMG by 6%-12% for 6s. Max 2 stacks. Can only occur once every 1s.

Toukabou Shigure

The character wielding this weapon will deal 16-32% more DMG to the opponent affected by Cursed Parasol.

Both weapons provide a DMG bonus buff to the user.

Since both Keqing and Al haitham are Talent multiplier based DPS, they actually can make use of DMG bonuses, thus both characters actually fully utilize the weapon passive.
            They're pretty much just EM statsticks.
                No way in hell you actually read and acknowledged the information presented in my reply.
Yeah, but im assuming that the dude doesnt have sealord or r5 based on their comments, so this comment serves no purpose to him.
    I don't think they're trying to be relevant to someone else, it's just pure comparison
And the person you replied to asked "Where" and "But it's event limited"

It's easier to assume that they don't have it and answer the question than to outright deny it. They just wanted to know how to get it, not if it's better or not.
    Then why the downvotes before the mention of event limited? The comment chain was making it sound like the one from dragonspine was better and should replace the tuna, so "don't bother, sea lord is better" is a very reasonable thing to say at that moment.
        Yeah, but the question is "Where is the Craftable Phys Weapon?"

Not "Is it better than Tuna?"

So those who deemed the response as irrelevant, downvoted. Simple as that.
            And the answer is it doesn't matter where, just keep using the tuna. Totally relevant. Maybe they thought it was the same user with Eula, or at least also letting them know too.

If anything, the OP has the irrelevant response, yet they have 200 upvotes on their reply.
Forgot about that part. Equally true. Somehow I decided to get it for my guaranteed Furina (in case I fail to get signature), and got it on my 13th single pull on weapon banner. Got another Favonius in between, so it was good pull.
    Fav sword is the hardest weapon for me to get. I swear. I had one at R5, but I lost it. Might have "accidentally" fed it to something when I was high. 🤒🤒

But getting the sword on your 13th pull is crazy lucky. It took me 30 or 40 lmao.
        Yeah. I had 50 pulls saved & ready to waste 30 of them before I hit soft pity on weapon banner (right now at 40 something).

    Fav is just better lmao.
Still my point stands that her bis is her 5 star weapon.
    If you have over 200% ER on her without an ER weapon, sure! But you probably won't have 40k HP. 😅 Her weapon is one of the biggest baits for whales/simps that I've ever seen.
They're pretty much just EM statsticks.
    No way in hell you actually read and acknowledged the information presented in my reply.

If anything, the OP has the irrelevant response, yet they have 200 upvotes on their reply.
I've noticed that a big reason I don't get many Fav swords is cuz the weapon banners it usually pops up in, I have no interest in. 😒😒
