[[Fun fact Liyue remains the only country without a regional Enormous Dead Thing™.]]





Zhongli the soil man buries the dead properly 🙏
    Thats why Hu Tao hired him

thats it give me your phone
                NO
                    YES
    Archon of Geo turns out to be the best at burying things, who would've guessed?
        bro just threw them to the sea
            Furina: what the f#ck, Morax?
            Nah, they were already in the sea. He tried to bury them properly. Look at the stone forest.
    He’s a Geo archon, after all.
    Kinda want an underground update for Liyue. Exploring the bowel of dead gods sound epic AF
        What, like the chasm?
            all the dead gods mashed together in Guyun Stone Forest 💀
                Except for the salt god, she has her own mausoleum
                    The Salt Goddess’s story was so sad 😭😭😭

                            I did the story AAAAAAGES ago, but I don’t remember Zhongli being the one that killed her?? I thought it was somebody else that did it
                                It was her own people
                                    Ok yeah that’s what I thought! Something like that, not Zhongli
                                He basically bullied weaker deity into suicide.
                                    What game afe you playing? She didn't commit suicide nor was pushed to do it by zhongli
                                    Mmmmm I don’t recall that
            Less rocky more alien or scorn-ish?
        Lowkey hoping Blackcliff Forge has a massive underground that connects to Chasm >! as hinted in Zhongli's voicelines !< and possibly extends to Enkanomiya?
            I forgor did they ever explain what the cave in the chasm was beyond just a cave that vored souls and showed them illusions?
                It was a small device that had been used to lock enemies inside during the Cataclysm.
    Turns everything he kills to compost
    Soil man 🤣🤣 thank you for that
    I thought that was Xiao's job
        No, no, Xiao's job is to exorcise the restless spirits of the gods Zhongli buried. We don't want a repeat of what happened in Tatarasuna, right?
Rex Lapis was the enormous dead thing.
    That, and the enormous “dead” thing is under the sea, pinned in place by a mountain range.
        yea in liyue they properly buried the big thing underground.
            Very fitting for Geo... and the home of Wangsheng Funeral Parlor.
                Zhongli working over there is starting to make sense now 😭
                    Zhongli: Hello I'd like to work here

Hu tao: And what experience do you have with funerals?

Zhongli: I buried a body in the stone forest

Hu tao: Close enough you're hired
                        Surely isn't it "*with* the stone forest"? :p
                            Or even "I buried the stone forest in a body"
                    [Everyone in Liyue](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi2-prod.mirror.co.uk%2Fincoming%2Farticle10496506.ece%2FALTERNATES%2Fs1200b%2FLittle-girl-from-side-eye-meme-all-grown-up.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=83cb1774e9216d6a92488e313e2399afa8506f6604672dbc2b78e0edac1d7ff3&ipo=images) 10 seconds after asking themselves why the assistant at the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor has an OP geo element genius invokaction card when he's just some old guy who doesn't even have a vision.
                        Zhongli: There has been a lot of interesting rumors about my origins, but truthfully, I am just a normal consultant working in the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor whom the gods blessed with a very powerful geo vision. (Zhongli has a fake vision that he “uses” whenever he fights).
                        He has a (of course fake) vision though.
                        > when he's just some old guy who doesn't even have a vision.

He has a fake vision.
                    He has great expertise in burying previously living things, one could say
                Amen to that
                Zhongli: "I would like to make a reservation".
            Swimming with the fishes
            In Xiao's trailer/demo, where the story of the Yaksha is told, there is a giant purple remains of a god.
        Dead *Things. By the end of Genshin, Osial's family will probably be buried under the sea.
            Beisht didn't die, she runs away after fighting Shenhe and the Traveler
                She'll be back in a few lantern rites
                    Maybe she'll move on. Maybe we'll see her in Fontaine dating a squid or something.
                        >!Elynas!< gets revived by the Abyss Order, hooks up with Beisht, and they elope to the Dark Sea together.
                            And make a bunch more cute creatures because Elynas liked being a dad
                    Ningguang: oh boy, here I go dropping another Jade Chamber again!
                        Beisht best girl out there creating construction jobs.
            Osial is about to get the Crota treatment.
                Aiat!
                Can’t wait to fuck him up next week
        At least I didn't have to look far before running into this comment.

Poor, forgotten Osial. Out of sight, out of mind, I guess. Though I'd say Guyun Stone Forest is one hell of a grave marker.
        Sea burial.
        Maybe later on we will face “dead” under the sea in liyue :))
        Underwater Liyue foreshadowing?
        That, and the enormous thing under the tree
        Man I hope fontaine powers somehow extend in the future so we can go explore there
        There's also Chi, buried under mountains, and Azdahaha, shoved face-first into the dirt and buried there.
    We forgor  :(
        Nah OP forgot. Then they made you think you forgot by presenting what appeared to be evidence.

We killed 2 giant sea serpents, and pretended a smol dragon was Rex Lapis, and saw 2 Jade Chambers in a lifetime. And don't forget the entire northern countryside and several aspects of Liyue are related to the Chi dragon. That's a big dragon.
    also chi
    That’s just what they want you to think.

Literally.  From a lore standpoint haha.  Morax that trickster with his endless mora yet no mora.
        F*cker is hiding all that mora down there
            If there isn’t enough it won’t cave in like memory foam when he sleeps on it
    oh yea :(
    dead-beat?
    As in his cake?
    OR WAS HE?
    I mean he probably feels pretty dead inside
    he has an enormous thing yeah
[I beg to differ](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/The_Chi_of_Yore?file=Screenshot_Chi_of_Guyun_-_Inside_Vault.png)
    Rex lapis was just better at hiding them and making them look more aesthetic lol
    Damn what a throwback
    Actually what is that round thing in the middle ?
        Probably something like a heart or something
    What's that
        The congealed blood of a dragon-like monster that Morax sealed near Qingce Village

>"...Rex Lapis overcame the Chi, but the Chi could not perish in its entirety. Thus did Rex Lapis conquer each of its facets in turn: its spirit was bound in the north, its bones were pinned in the south-east, its flesh was incarcerated in the north-west, its soul was fettered in the north-east, and its form was crushed in the south-west..."  
>  
>"...Its bones pierced, its spirit faded, its form and soul both decimated... still did its flesh survive..."
            If I'm not mistaken it's on Baizhu story quests.
                It's located in the north of Qingce village, near a waterfall with an entrance. The domain in Baizhu's story quest isn't associated with it though
                    The domain in Baizhu's story quest contains blood that had leaked into that cavern/cave/ruins from the Chi and that's what was used to make the poison.

>Xiao: So someone has been concocting demonic poison...  
>  
>Xiao: Too often, fervent desires drive mortals to abandon all regard for their own safety... It is lamentable.  
>  
>Xiao: I now know what you seek. It is true that a god's remains are buried beneath the foundations of Qingce Village.  
>  
>Xiao: A vile monster known as the Chi once wrought havoc over this land, before it was subdued by Rex Lapis...  
>  
>Xiao: The land was finally cleansed of poison when Rex Lapis used statues in his likeness to seal the serpent's remains. Qingce Village was founded sometime after that.  
>  
>Xiao: The seal is still mostly intact. If the Chi is the source, then it must be some of its blood leaking from deep underground.
                Its a world quest that appears in Baizu story.
            Is this the Chi of Yor of the baizhu one?
                It was relevant to his story quest but it's had its own dedicated world quest since 1.0. It used to be called Chi of Guyun before it got renamed in 1.6
        Nightmares, dude, nightmares.

But actually God named Chi that lived in Qingce https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Chi
            bro discombobulated chi and sent it's bits everywhere
    now THIS is a fun fact
    Also, isn't the "tree" over Azhdaha's domain actually his tail?
    I remember that quest, felt like hell back then
The Chi of yore quest. In Qingce village.
    Unvoiced world quest. Requires reading comprehension. We don't do that here. 

To be honest, I'm surprised there's so many people in this thread mentioning it.
        I think because that quest absolutely obliterated a lot of unsuspecting players. It’s definitely one of the most frequent quests I help low AR players on behind Dragonspine’s In the Mountains quest line
        Personally I forgot it ever existed. Once you do that quest and clean out the area of treasure there's 0 reason to care about the place let alone remember it.
        What are you talking about?
        It's also mentioned in Baizhu's SQ, which is voiced.
    Not just that but also the >!Sal Terrae disaster!< could also count in my opinion

>!Maybe it’s not a single dead thing but an entire royal court turned to salt is certainly enough salt for me to think it could count!<
        Also the dust cloud over Cuijue slope might possibly be Guizhong.
The azhdaha we fight is just a projection of his spirit. his body is buried down deep and his tail is the tree what's supposed to be his tail.  TLDR: angry frogge tail is that huge tree
    So entered thru Azdhaha's butt?
        Precisely
            Eastern Mythology: The anus is the gateway to the soul, not joking

It's why the "Headless" boss in Sekiro executes him  has a deadly anus grab attack
                Played Sekiro after watching Sarazanmai and knew exactly what was going down.

For those who haven’t seen the anime, three boys get cursed and have to help quell grumpy spirits by pulling an orb from their butt.
                    Never thought I'd see a fellow Sarazanmai enjoyer in the wild
                        There are literally dozens of us! Dozens!
                    Fellow sarazanmai enjoyer! That show was so goood
                And then there's the Kappa.
                ...I mean, it's fair, since you'll react far more to anything entering your anus
                    Unless you're Thanos, because sending Ant Man up there somehow isn't going to kill him.
                And that's why we have the dung eater in ER
            Lmao
            We Ant-Man'd him.
        In other words, his Azz-dha-hole
    Off topic but before one of the updates I would always find a chicken wing in the pond next to azdaha.

Then one update came, not sure which, and there was no more daily chicken wings. 


Anyone else had this?
        Sometimes the bird landed in water instead of land and it died instantly. I dont know when was the last time i checked.
            Seems to corroborate with what others say. I guess one update fixed it entire for me
            Oh my god is THAT what happened? I shot that bird once, years ago, but I was too lazy to run and pick up the chicken wings so I left them there. This whole time I thought it was just the years-old chicken wings I couldn't be bothered to pick up.
                I'm sure i witnessed its death at least once or twice.
        It's nothing lore related. It's a spawn time thing. The birbs are supposed to spawn on top of the rock in the middle of the pool but at times, the assets would spawn late and the birbs, would fall directly in the pool resulting in instant chicken wings.
            Wouldn’t they then still spawn on the rock though? Or did they spawn inside it or something?

I mean not that I don’t believe you just curious how that bug works/worked.
                The bird itself might spawn in a slightly off spot, too. I remember going fishing in Sumeru outside of the Aranara village, and sometimes I'd see cranes underneath the water, then die when I approached the fishing spot.
            Hmn makes sense to me I guess. I suppose one update fixed it on my end hence no more single chicken wing


My head cannon was that they were feeding it to the tree
        Yes if you go there fast enough you will see the living bird fly down to the pond but somehow always land in the deepest area and so ensue chicken wing drop animation
            I usually just TP to the nearest area and casually walk around. Always had the chicken wing no matter how I approached the pond. Then one update it stopped spawning completely.

But your post with someone else's explanation makes sense to me
        Happens in random places, was on watasumi island the other day and a crane went to land on the beach and was too far in the water and watched him poof into chicken legs before my eyes.
            That's hilarious. I never got to witness it in real time. So I was always wondering why there were chicken wings in the middle of a pond and only at the pool by azdaha. (It never happened to me anywhere else)
                Someone else in the thread says it happens when assets don't load in before the bird does so they land in the water before the rock can spawn in.
        I just saw this, but I remembered this was actually investigated by keqingmains waaay back, more than 2 years ago now lmao.

https://library.keqingmains.com/evidence/general-mechanics/miscellaneous-entries#ded-bird
    Does he count as being alive or dead?
        I don't know if we know the details, but dragons don't seem to die when they die. We >!speak to Elynas!< and I think Durin's mind is still kicking around.
            Ignoring the time honored rule of "People die when they are killed", SMH
                “Did you really think killing me would make me die?”
                Well, they aren't "people" in the first place
                Cause they are not "people".

Which is the implication of the statement which is often taken out of context.
            If the Breacher Primus have nothing in common with any Teyvat lifeforms and they are Elynas’ cells then Elynas itself is an alien and should not be compared to Sovereign related dragons, but might have more in common with artificial ones like Durin if Rhinedottr used it’s kind as a base.
                >!if you speak with elynas, he talks about his mother. that mother says the same things she said to durin. ergo, rhinedottir is the mother of both durin and elynas. she didn't use him as a base (unless you mean, he might have been her first successful creation, and then she used the same formulas for others - then maybe. but he is more of a true dottore's segment, than a scaramouche to dottore, if we are to compare the two experiments of creation). she found his consciousness out in the open cosmos, but gave him the body like durin, and put his consciousness there. so the two of them have everything in common.!<
                    So aliens aren’t real? :(
            >!that could be an abyss creature/gold's creation thing though, since neuvillette is almost definitely the hydro sovereign/very powerful hydro dragon, it seems like dragons (at least powerful ones) get reborn, and abyss creatures stick around as ghosts, possibly the state they were in before gold did stuff with them.!<
                >!it also could be all dragons, though. azhdaha's spirit is still kicking. also, durin and elynas are still dragons, albeit artificial with abyssal powers. we don't know why rhine created them. she might have tried to create a power balance between sovereigns and abyss, and managed to make some counterparts to already existing dragons? we might find more and more in the future. either way, it might be the fate of dragons specifically, even artificial.!<
        *Sealed*  


Not alive because his soul is in an adepti realm.
        I mean they're counting the Ruin Golems here and we still operated then.
    Oh is it just his spirit we fight? I just assumed they scaled him down for gameplay purposes
        Well, the technical reason is what gave the lore explanation. Would be a bummer having him smaller than Stormterror in canon, considering the description he was given.
    I recall there being something I read that stated that tree was sprung from the bodies of three dead gods and not just Azhdaha. Did I just make that up in my head or mistakenly attribute it for something else?
        You might be thinking of the Harvisptokhm in the northern Sumeru desert, made from the Lord of Amrita, Lord of Verdure and the Goddess of Flowers
            Thanks for the reply. It's been a bit since I did any lorediving.
    Where is it stated that the azhdaha we fought was a spirit projection?
        Literally the domain is an adepti realm.
            And? How does that mean that it's azhdaha's spirit that we're fighting?
                Literally the domain is an adepti realm.
                    Irrelevant. Azhdaha was physically brought to the cavernous realm before the entrance was sealed. I'm assuming you're just trolling now.
                        He is physically buried on the valley, hence the tremors happening on the Vishap event and continuing on Zhongli's second quest. it's literally his seal breaking off, and we only fight him after the little girl enters the realm and becomes the Azhdaha we fight. I'm not trolling, the explanation is that we don't enter a cave, instead we enter an adeptus realm that is the seal keeping his body dead
                            We're literally said to have entered a cave that has an entrance blocked off by an ancient seal. That's literally the same exact place that azhdaha is described to be sealed at. The size difference could just be argued for be downscaled for gameplay purposes like most large bosses are in this game.

I will admit I forgot about the fact that he literally turns back into the girl after defeat and zhongli calling the girl azhdaha's power incarnate, but it being an "adeptus realm" has nothing to do with it and isn't an explanation, hence why I assumed you were trolling.
                                Well, he's buried beneath the valley, nothing stops it being inside a cavern, but well, if we were to fight him physically, he'd end up being prime geovishap+ in lore as well. Also because the crucial detail is that the seal weakening made earthquakes happen in Liyue, and that was yet another lore quest on a limited event.  Either way, he's indeed downscalled for technical limitations, it'd be so great if instead we had another kaiju battle aside from Dvalin.
    where do we learn that its his spirit projection?
Does the ex-god we crushed under the first Jade Chamber count? 

Of course, until we can go under the sea (Unda tha sea!) we won't see it...
    I think his wife is still kicking
        Osial is still alive too, he was just resealed after the chamber dropped on him. After that is >!when the Abyss was wanting to transform him into Mecha Osial!<.
            I really hope we see an alternate future at some point where that actually happened, it’s too cool to just be mentioned in one quest.
                I have a feeling he’s going to get a human form like the other gods in liyue have been getting of late and a less powerful form of him becomes a hydro unit,

Make him a massive tsundere who bickers with zhongli for added comedy
                    Records of Jueyun Vol 2 speaks of a Sea God with a fairly empathetic personality who may or may not have been Osial... It would be nice to see that expanded into a playable character.
                        I get the impression he’s mad at Morax but they might have been friends prior to the war. It would be funny to see them sat at a table like we had the archons at dinner during lantern rite, just jabbing at each other
                            Hu Tao: Zhongli, could you please pass the salt to our guest?

Zhongli: *laughs quietly*

Osial disguised as a human: Be careful not to drop it in the ocean, too.
        Yep, wife ran off
            KILL WIFE!  


Wife gone.  


Think about wife...
    Na he ain't ded.
    zl doesn't really "kill" gods because he knows how much they fuck up the environment, he just seals them
    won't happen but now i really want an undersea expansion in liyue for this...
Bro the Elynas quest made me feel bad for the creature. It just wanted its children to thrive.
    It seems that all creatures from the abyss don't really seem to understand the harm they are doing. Elynas and Durin both just wanted to feel the sun and live with everyone on the surface. Also, when they did start destroying things, they experienced it as a strange dream and really didn't understand what was happening. It really makes me sad for them.
        The fact that Elynas is still just having a grand ol’ time even when dead is really something. Even more so when he’s like, “Yo Jakob is about to revive me and I really miss him. That’s cool and all but then my resurrected organs would crush and reabsorb my adorable children and their village so could you stop him from reviving me? Thanks”
            The way he talks about Jakob is cute. "Oh that abyss boy ate me. I hope he likes it. Now he's waking me up to say thank you. That's nice."
            I really like Elynas. Dude's living vicariously through his children in the best way possible.

I would really like to see his original form at some point.
        Does abyss creatures is some kind of cosmic entity shit (chutlu and every space octopus thingy) but at the same time, it goes both ways


Mortal comprehension will never understand the abyss and will end up being insane.


At the same time these creatures also didn't understand why they accidentally cause a genocide and environment pollution while just chilling and sunbathing.
        Durin was poisoned/corrupted, had he not been he wouldn't have cause so much destruction.
            Was Durin poisoned? I thought he was made with abyssal energy since his blood was full of it
                His blood was full of it because of what Gold/Rhindottir did. Durin "woke up" from the fatal blow Dvalin inflicted on him.

"*Even after he woke to find that he had been dealt a killing blow by Dvalin, Durin held no ill will toward Dvalin or Barbatos and only wished that they could have met under better circumstances.*"
                    I don't think he was poisoned.

Dragonspine Spear

>"Now then, this great blessing that pulses through my veins,"

So just like Elynas, Durin's entire world was the Abyss before being brought up to the surface. I think it's more like a Simurgh situation where, like Rukkhadevata, Gold fashioned a form for these Abyssal creatures.

                        Lol rhinedottire really looking sus now isnt she

She's singlehandedly responsible for the cataclysms of 2 different nations.... that we know of.

\#1 worst mom award
                            She seems like a horrible person but her "Children" speak so highly of her: Durin, Elynas, Albedo.
                            More than that, she's also indirectly responsible for the whole Mondstadt AQ, since Dvalin was poisoned and corrupted from his wounds from the Durin fight

In fontaine too she released a giant dragon which was most likely cataclysmic, and we still don't know the full extent of her involvement in whatever the fuck happened in Kaen'riah 500years ago. So that's at least three regions so far and maybe more if she was an active part of the Kaen'rian disaster that affected every nation without exception
                                Whats the 3rd? I was counting mondstadt and fontaine. I know there were riftwolves in inazuma's cataclysm but their relationship with her vs other abyss monsters seems muddy

And yee elynas's blood leaking into the waters poisoned fontaine, presumably what killed off the oceanids
                                    > Whats the 3rd? I was counting mondstadt and fontaine. I know there were riftwolves in inazuma's cataclysm but their relationship with her vs other abyss monsters seems muddy

Golden Wolflord is the connection

“ Hailing from a dark world, this ruler of the black wolves has the power to call upon its followers, its hidden claws, to dissolve space itself and forge a rift through which it may enter. The Wolflord has no name, for it was but one of "Gold"'s unintentional creations, and that is precisely why it is obsessed with invading worlds that do not belong to it and making a name for itself. That said, the wolf pack is far from unintelligent. After suffering a defeat in its previous invasion, a deserted island where no humans or protectors dwell has been selected for them to prepare for their lord's descent.”
                            It doesn’t necessarily make her a bad mom though. The two things we know of that makes her a bad mom arent from Durin and Elynas even though they ended up causing bad things to happen. The worst is her throwing a replica of Albedo into Durin’s stomach but even then, we dont exactly know *why* she did it, only that she objectively did it. Beyond threatening to leave Albedo, Rhinedottoir never actually abuses her children or anything. Durin and Elynas dont even say that she’s a bad person or evil just that they’re grateful
                    i am pretty sure that means that his spirit "woke up" after death the same way elynas' spirit did when we talked to him. his body is still dead. and it already was created with abyssal energy, he wasn't poisoned. he *was* the poison.
    At least the Melusines now is more thriving with their new adoptive dad
    that's the fate of invasive species regardless. even in real world
    He is so nice too
Well yeah, they're all burried
Half of the mountains on Liyue are literally their gravestone s
    Exactly. Like I think that's why Liyue is full of vengeful spirits literally everywhere that Xiao has to stay in Wangshu Inn in the center of Liyue to continually deal with them.
        Liyue is basically a nation built on a graveyard.
            I used to live on top of an old graveyard, it's pretty rad AND annoying when every time there was an issue with a pipe, archeologists had to come in and dig out those bones and we'd have massive hole in the ground for months. 😂
        If Inazuma had a Xiao, maybe Yashiori and Tararasuna wouldn't be so abandoned.
            Then again, Liyue's pretty empty for the most part
Someone forgot about Chi
    And azdaha
        We still fight him so I don’t think he counts as he’s not dead
            He is as dead as elynas. We fought his spirit as his actual body is much greater in size( the tree is his tail)
                So we enter the bossfight through... his a##hole
                So azdaha is a stand user
                That’s big
                >We fought his spirit

Where is this stated? His size could simply be downscaled for gameplay purposes.
                    In Zhongli's 2nd story quest. Azhdaha's soul was split into 2 parts, the good and the bad. The good went into Kun Jun, and the bad formed into a little girl. That little girl then turned into the Azhdaha that we fought, while the good one fought alongside us, so we only fought half his soul, making him smaller than what he actually is.
                    Jiu (which turns into the boss) and Kun Jun were polar opposites of his soul. Neither were the actual physical Azhdaha
Wasn’t Guyun Stone Forest made by rock spears that impaled fallen beings during the archon war?
    But we only see the remaining rock spearhead things and not whatever fallen beings Zhongli fought
    Yep, and each is a tombstone for a fallen God

Zhongli tells us this, I think at the end of his story quest 1
Wasn't there that chi thing
Isnt there like technically 4 or 5 gods burried in Liyue?

The Giant Tree beside the Azdaha portal is Azdahas Tail. We fight his spirit but his physical body is burried under mountains, his tail sticking out.

2 Sea Serpent Gods burried on the seaside of Liyue.

The Quince Village god.

And I think theres something thats trapped down the depths of the Chasm.
    Also salt god’s tomb in Sal Terrae.
    All of them are properly sealed. Not dead nor spewing corrosive substances around. Zhongli did his job well.
        Adding onto this, Liyue also has a *number* of extant internal agents who's only job is to SPECIFICALLY make sure that all of the negative karma and harmful energies *stay* sealed. The Exorcist clan, Cloud Retainer's students, the Wansheng Funeral Parlor (that now has Zhongli himself on payroll), Xiao... all of them engaged in actual karmic and spiritual cleanup constantly.

And some tiny breakouts *do* still occur - and are quickly and swiftly dealt with. Monstadt doesn't have the manpower at the moment and considers Dragonspine mostly contained (it is), Inazuma chose to try and use the energies for more productive purposes (thanks to Dottore), Sumeru is trying to actively research into and contain sites with people more interested in study then containment, and Fontaine just seems happy to not think about the problem (for the moment) and has somewhat more concerning extant issues (the prophecy).

Liyue's got it's crap together. God of Contracts took this job as seriously as he does anything else he signs paperwork to do, apparently.
            NotChina is the mightiest and grandest nation after all. Their social problem amounts to "elderly folks are a bit lonely in their idyllic village" and "citizens are so dutiful and diligent that they overwork themselves sometimes, but the ruling class is perfectly benevolent and wise though". Glory to the CCP.
                Literally the Liyue archon quest was zhongli literally staging his own death to retire because his Nation is so perfect it needs no more god to change it.
                    Glorious Liyue, so so much better than the rest of Teyvat.
Xiao is Teyvat's best janitor.
They’re underwater, underground or becomes part of the environment
Rex Lapis buried them respectfully after their demise to be precise.
Eh...

Guyun counts, it's their headstone though
Zhongli knows how to burry enemies, look at Guyun stone forest
Guizhong literally blew up into a ball of dust above the 9 pillars area what do you mean
Aside from Azdhaha and Chi in Qingque village, the Yakshas are around specifically to clean up dead god remains with Hu Tao's clan being around to also help with the disposal and he also imprisoned and threw a lot of the dead god bodies to Guyun Stone Forest. In short, he cleans up after himself. 

By far, he is the most meticulous and responsible Archon around that is until he started planning his retirement and then he started getting irresponsible like not setting up his own pension.
That giant skeleton in Fontaine is Elynas?!!? N he that big ?
    Yep. You can see the guy’s skull
        Don’t forget the ribs you can see elsewhere on the island
        But that look more like a dragon,he look more like his daughters
            He doesn’t actually look like a melusine, but he loves them so chooses to take that form
                How they was born when he died ?
                    It didn’t happen immediately.  >!There was a big battle inside his body between two factions some time after he died that left shards of shrapnel from exploded robots stabbed all over his insides, the melusines were born from those wounds, they’re basically walking talking scabs/cysts.!<
                        Gross
                        THATS WHAT THEY ARE?? Why tf are they so cute then? 🤧
            He also said that he hopes that we get to see his true form or something like that near the end of their world quest
            He's actually that dragon. The form he took was just an avatar of sorts.
                Oh
            He just takes the form of them.
I wouldn't count mechanical golems as "dead"
    Especially with how damn functional the one in Hadramaveth actually was. That thing traversed across the whole Desert.
    Yeah, to me it’s either “big dead things” (Dragonspine, Yashiori, Elynas) or “massive incurable voids” (the Chasm, the Desert of Hadramaveth). It’ll be interesting to see if we get big void in Fontaine
Liyue probably has the most enormous dead thing. The lord of geo is just very good at burying and hiding them
it has a regional giant alive thing(azhdaha), also the tree that absorbed his essence

and if you count osial and zhongli giant stone spears as giant stuff
    For some reason I thought that tree was Azhdaha’s tail
        Because it is
        Confirmed to indeed be his tail.
        Azhdaha used its Elemental affinity to merge its tail to the tree as a way of absorbing ley line energy,  if I remember.  Its why the tree is still there post-fight.
    Someone mentioned before the chasm is aszdaha's butt hole, and I could no longer unsee it
Cause Zhongli seals not kill (most of the time)
Zhongli seal them up nicely, unlike other archon who left their mess around, yes, especially you shogun
Morax clean well his shit , thats why he is so loved.
Because grandpa zhong cleans up after all of his giant battles
Apart from Chi of Yore mentioned by others, Cuijue Slopes match the description of the sky when Guizhong died.
That's because hu tao lives there. If there were corpses laying around above ground, it would be bad for her business.
Morax did his job of keeping liyue safe
Chi of Yore is there
I don’t think a machine counts as dead.
    Not only do they not count as dead (because they aren't alive to begin with), even if they did, none of the three are completely inactive. You turn on various systems of all of them and even move one around.
The true is sorta an Enormous Dead Thing, since that's where Azdha was buried and he's sorta had an identity death due to his mind getting corrupted/split, plus the good part that split off possessed somebody like a ghost. So he's kinda dead.
What about the dead things in the ocean, and the dead salt goddess, and Azhdaha, and the chasm
    Properly buried/sealed, not accessible to the public. My man's zhongli gets the job done. He deserves that retirement
Ruin Golems can't be dead because they were never living beings
Thank the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor today

If those didn't get properly buried, we would have consecrated beasts in Liyue
I never knew Durin’s skull was there.

I noticed the ribs (how could you not), but not the skull.
There are technically fossils in the chasm…
Liyue has its dead things and mostly dead things properly buried under the ground or out at sea LMAO
The stone forest. They used to be spears that zhongli killed an elder god with, the dead thing is just underwater XD
Azhaha and Also its implies many gods are sealed in guyun Stone forest, they may orbmay not be enormous tho
I have bad news for you about the stone forest
Does Havria's settlement count?
    Man I love  reddit
/s

unable to load a single image.
Hu tao lives there. If it's dead it's going in a coffin.
Azdaha is dead
The lore states that Liyue has multiple gods that could qualify but they specifically aren’t dead. Killing an ancient god would likely release enough pure elemental energy to destroy the country so Rex Lapis imprisoned them during the Archon War. Maybe he faked his death because killing him for real will do the same.
    Man also just wanted to retire and not unalived fr
Indeed... Because liyue has THREE.  

Azhdaha, Chi of Yore and Osial.  
One is buried deep underground with its tail sticking out  
Another is literally scattered everywhere  
Another one was pinned deep underwater by a storm of massive spears that turned into a mountain range over time  
Its not that Rex Lapis didn't kill anyone, it's that he did it too well.
And thanks to the amazing melusine quest, we know durin >! might not stay dead !<
Maybe you mean it’s god
Qingce Village. Like prior comments.
Weren't the dead things in Liyue all buried under the ocean?
Does Azdaha count?
Dead, ancient mechanical/primordial beings my beloved ❤️
Dead, ancient mechanical/primordial beings my beloved ❤️
tbf most of them are hidden underground
Does Azhdaha not count? That huge tree is his tail 🤔 so that's basically his resting place

Does the Guyun Stone Forest not count? They're not bones, but it is a burial ground for many gods Morax threw his spears at
Chi (sealed god from Baizhu and other world quests), Azhdaha, John Lee.
The dragon thing
Not sure if Stone Guyun Forest counts, isn't it where Morax defeated Osial before it was resummoned by Fatui yet "homewrecked" by Ningguang?
Yet.
Ruin golems don't count brooo
Meanwhile the whole Guyun Stone Forest being a graveyard of sorts for other gods.
Well the golden house begs to differ
I've been playing this game for almost 3 years now and just realized that we can actually see durin's skull
Is Osial dead, or just resealed (which angered Beisht)?
Yet
Just because it’s under the ocean doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist…
That leviathan the jade palace took out would have left some massive remains too.
That's not true. That big sun god/ball thing where all the old people live is there.
Would be nice if we ever see some of them in their original form alive someday.

Elynas did promise us he would show us.
It is because Rex Lapis buried most of them in Guyun Stone Forrest so we can't see them exactly. [There's also Chi](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Chi) and the 9 Pillars of Piece World Quest that's kinda underwhelming. [Osial](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Osial) & [Beisht](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Beisht) too were somewhere deep in front of Liyue's Harbor.
Because Azdaha is ALIVE
Isn't Osail pined and buried by gigantic stone pillars just outside of the harbour?

Liyue still has its enormous dead things, it's just out of sight.
Wait until we have Blackcliff Forge. XD
Someone is not completely paying attention to the lore. Nice try though. Research better.
I don't think I golems count as "dead" they weren't even alive.
Chi wants a word with you.
they're 🎵*under the sea*🎵
They know how to bury their Enormous Dead Things™ in earth magic country.
imo I believe in the theory that vuijue slope is where Guizhong was sealed which explains the forever dusty sky there
Rex lapis like a real lazy bum, used a gigantic broom and swept it underwater
that's because Morax went around the country doing extensive cleanup after his messes 😂
frfr
no morax's big dragon is big dead thing
Just you wait, just you wait
I mean. What about the Chasim.. I'm sure there's something hidden away in there.
some of them are under the sea
Liyue is the country most plagued by dead gods though
 I think you mean: Ruin Gundam
That proves how skilled Rex Lapis was in slaying things.
What about zhonglis spears that have gods trap under them?
Also inazuma is the only island without an -ussy unless watatsussy counts
Azhdaha and Osial are there. They're just buried. Fitting for the home of the Wangsheng Funeral Patlour
It is also the region without a regional tree or pool
It’s in the ocean
They got buried by asteroids.
Blessing of Marchosius / Guoba
Isnt there the giant heart of a dead god in a cave north of the village at the top of the map?
I don't agree that Ruin Golems count, lol.
The dragon heart core thing in qingce village
Look if there's one thing you can say about Liyue it's that they know how to bury their dead. The Wangsheng Funeral Parlor would consider it an insult if some godly being died and they weren't able to perform its funerary rites. One Qiqi is enough, even for Hu Tao.
Hmm what about the evil deity that controlled xiao.
The enormous dead thing is under water
Azhdaha is still alive oops
Because it's in the water with the old jade palace
Guyun Stone Forest is basically a graveyard of an ancient dead god.
I feel like Vorukasha Oasis would technically fit Sumeru more than the Golems.
Wangsheng Funeral Parlor and Zhongli doing a bangin job since the beginning I guess. Zhongdong the pillar man probably has peak burial experience looking at the fucking mountains he dropped on past gods
Kinda true, but plenty of things in liyue are literal tombs.


Sal Terrae should count as such, and Stone Forest is... well...
Isn't there a whole city of calcified people there?
ALL HAIL REX LAPIS
Zhongli didn't "die" for you to fabricate slander like this.
They are all sealed underground I think
It had one but it decided to "magically dissapear his fatass" after feign a death from a stroke and accidentaly making a foreign traveler as the main suspect and then giving a lame ass apology.
Isn't it because azhada is sealed, not killed?
Which is why it’s instead home to Chutulu’s asshole(chasm).
IIRC, the terraces in Qince village are the scales of a dragon and the river is the blood ??
To be fair, can ruin guards be considered things that were once alive and are now dead?
Because it's 600 feet under.

Zhongli drops the mic.
Forgetting Azzy-dhaha?
Azdhaha is technically there. The tree we go to face him is actually his tail. And he’s dead. So it’s actually true that Liyue  has a dead thing too.
Well yeah, cuz the enormous thing won't die. Big Dong Zhong couldn't kill it, so he sealed it. Then the thing came back and so Ningning had to seal it with her house. Then enormous wifey thing came by and threw a karen fit at Ningning's new house, so Auntie Mommy had to come play Elsa and went to beat it up with Blondie. Enormous wifey thing still got away so now Liwoowoo has two enormous things that isn't dead.
Does Azhdaha tree count?
are ruin guards living creatures? disclaimer: might have sped thru a lot of quests. lol
Tbh enormous dead thing of everywhere else feels nothing compared to the darkened spots of perished hilichurls under the Chasm in Liyue. Feelsbadman. 
(If you know, you know)
We sort of killed the enormous  thing ourselves  tho??? Well... Jade Chamber nuked it.
Do the Ruin Guards really count as living beings now dead?
Osial would like a word though he's impaled in a watery grave where we can't swim so we can't explore his guts.
Didn’t we fight a reincarnated giant leviathan hydra thing to close out the story there? It was so big they needed a building to fight it.
Idk bro
Azhdaha pretty much fits in this list
what about chi
Zhongli makes sure to bury his enemies, thats why
"Regional enormous dead thing" a phrase never heard before
Isn't Guyun Stone Forest a graveyard for those Enormous Dead Things?
Osial.
That was true before last Klee's birthday.
How about Inazuma?
another fact, sumeru is the only nation of which local specialty doesnt need to apply an element to harvest
    That's not unique to Sumeru. Local specialties from Liyue also doesn't need to apply element to harvest, although it's far more effective and faster to use Geo to get Cor Lapis, it isn't necessary.
Aside from the others in the comments, we also get a dark dusty sky near where guizhong was buried

Liyue has a lot of dead things in it
Fontaine doesn't have a Giant Tree(if you don't consider the previous hydro archon)
Wasn't there a dragon's core/heart in the quest called Chi of Yor in Qince village?
Is more impressive when we remember Rex Lapis and his crew killed the most gods during the archon war.

The mountain dropping God having so many mountains (let alone that his war hands are significantly larger than EI) seems to imply Liyue is a graveyard and that most mountains mark the resting place of a God.
That’s because after we killed off Childe’s massive ego he kept following us and is now in Fontaine.
There is like 4-5 sea dragons buried and sealed lol
Chi: am i joke to you?  
those big orange rock at jueyun karst is his blood
There is one in Liyue is just that Rex Lapis really fucking hated it, so he buried it beneath the sea and his pillars
- Azdaha's tail being a huge tree.

- the salt goddess ( big salt at the entrance ) 

- the huge stone spears in the sea ( dead sea god underneath) 


Liyue has tons of big dead things , they are just buried which in fact fits pretty well the land of geo
osail would count as liyue's big "dead" thing imo. except he's sealed instead of dead.
Azhdaha's tail
Azhdahas tail?
That's because Rex Lapis bruied his enemies
Cuz morax was the strongest DADD- archon
Azhdaha, chi of yore and osial under the guyun stone forest. Zhongli has em too, he just buried em real good. Fitting, as said by others, of the lord of geo
We did see the Chi in Baizhu's story quest. Also, the tree-like things around mount Tianheng could be the antlers from that adeptus who sacrificed them to stop the mountain from falling
Because Skeleton is banned in China.
For now
Qiqi
Stone forest islands: hello?
It would've been Osial
Azdahas grave
Even dragonspine has a regional enormous dead thing
It’s cuz they ain’t dead, they be chillin under the rock spears Morax hurled at the rival gods.
The hbu ally the golems aren’t dead they still have some fuctionality
Guyun Stone Forest is basically a giant dead thing, along with that flat shallow water area

Half of Liyue is a graveyard for Archons
People don't give Wangsheng Funeral Parlor enough credit ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
YET

......okay but the cemetery of spears is probably pretty close
Rex lapis has a good cleanup crew called xiao and co.
Liyue expansion confirmed?
haha liyue remains
What about Guyun Stone Forest? Isn't the Overlord of the Vortex buried there?
Because Qiqi is small
I wish this game wasn't a gacha grindfest, I loved the bit of time I spent with it but I would've loved to be able to just explore this world at my own pace instead of at a glacial crawl.
Uh… Chi?
Their regionally enormous dead thing is buried under the stone forest.
It’s tail is sticking out of the ground. It was always there. It was just buried a little better.
Hmm, nice forest over here. I wonder if something's dead below
And also remains the worst region
Just you wait ;)
Most of the mountains and spires you see in Liyue are weapons that were used to pin down or kill gods
The chasm has a bunch of stuff trapped doesn't it? Plus osairas is dead under the water
I am 100% sure the plot revolved around him becoming the Regional Enormous Dead Thing.
its probably somewhere unreleased, the dragon in pjws’s lore i imagine
Dead is associated with unluckiness there ain't no way they'd put one in Liyue which represents China.
Let's hope we get a Liyue underwater area with Osial's remain pinnned with giant rock spears then
What about ahzdaha and his sealed body, only his tail stuck out. We only fought and avatar of him
Not cool Rex lapis died for us. But really the dead thing is in the ocean those rock formation are spears.
Osial and all the other dead monsters in the stone lance forest in the middle of the water? Or they need ro be visible on the map to count?

Don't know you, but cleaning those corpes should be quite a priority.
Wait, I just remembered that the Bishui River is supposed to be made from the blood of Skybracer after it told Xiao (I think) to cut off it's antlers so the it could use them to keep Mt. Tianheng (I think) from collapsing.
First quest of zhongli shows what happens to anything that dies in Liyue : aka thrown in the ocean.
Liyue dead thing is just buried and turn into the land
There was one, but Kaveh stole it.
Chi of Yore

Dragon-Queller in Nantienmen

Cuijue Slope, namely the big dust cloud that persists in the area

under the Guyun Stone Forest
I remember I've seen something like a giant "robot" half buried in the sand not far from the Chasm. I thought it was from Khaenriah (can't remember the right way to write it, sorry).
But who’s the most enormous death thing
Until you realized that “Rex Lapis” is in a minting factory and almost half of Liyue exists because he was just flexing his powers
You're forgetting that thing in the ocean...
That's bc Rex Lapis actively avoided killing things and sealed them away instead. You can see this with the Chi of Yore, Osial, Besht, Azhdaha, Havria, and the Chasm. This resulted in very little of Liyue being corrupted (like most of Inazuma) and those few places where a god *did* die, the yakshas cleaned up the corruption so it didn't cause harm.
Double check
I mean, you can't exactly see it properly when the Enormous Dead Thing™ is under the sea
Nope,You are Wrong Cause The Chasm Underground Mines also comes under Liyue area and it has several dead Thingies which you are talking about.
the chi of yore : hold my beer
What's with the Sal Terrae and the Goddess of Salt?
Isn't the Guyun Stone forest a burial ground for the big baddy-types?
That's cause most of the ground is one giant dead thing(s).
Liyue literally has an area where a god died, the goddess of dust Guizhong, which darkened the sky with dust. Its not a big skelly but still a "Enormus Dead Thing"
My Bro Zhongli did a good job
Hu Tao has to make her mora *somewhere* after all, right?
Thats why Hu Tao hired him
    [deleted]
        \-venti image-

thats it give me your phone
            NO
                YES
Archon of Geo turns out to be the best at burying things, who would've guessed?
    bro just threw them to the sea
        Furina: what the f#ck, Morax?
        Nah, they were already in the sea. He tried to bury them properly. Look at the stone forest.
He’s a Geo archon, after all.
Kinda want an underground update for Liyue. Exploring the bowel of dead gods sound epic AF
    What, like the chasm?
        all the dead gods mashed together in Guyun Stone Forest 💀
            Except for the salt god, she has her own mausoleum
                The Salt Goddess’s story was so sad 😭😭😭
                    [deleted]
                        I did the story AAAAAAGES ago, but I don’t remember Zhongli being the one that killed her?? I thought it was somebody else that did it
                            It was her own people
                                Ok yeah that’s what I thought! Something like that, not Zhongli
                            He basically bullied weaker deity into suicide.
                                What game afe you playing? She didn't commit suicide nor was pushed to do it by zhongli
                                Mmmmm I don’t recall that
        Less rocky more alien or scorn-ish?
    Lowkey hoping Blackcliff Forge has a massive underground that connects to Chasm >! as hinted in Zhongli's voicelines !< and possibly extends to Enkanomiya?
        I forgor did they ever explain what the cave in the chasm was beyond just a cave that vored souls and showed them illusions?
            It was a small device that had been used to lock enemies inside during the Cataclysm.
Turns everything he kills to compost
Soil man 🤣🤣 thank you for that
I thought that was Xiao's job
    No, no, Xiao's job is to exorcise the restless spirits of the gods Zhongli buried. We don't want a repeat of what happened in Tatarasuna, right?
That, and the enormous “dead” thing is under the sea, pinned in place by a mountain range.
    yea in liyue they properly buried the big thing underground.
        Very fitting for Geo... and the home of Wangsheng Funeral Parlor.
            Zhongli working over there is starting to make sense now 😭
                Zhongli: Hello I'd like to work here

Hu tao: And what experience do you have with funerals?

Zhongli: I buried a body in the stone forest

Hu tao: Close enough you're hired
                    Surely isn't it "*with* the stone forest"? :p

                    Zhongli: There has been a lot of interesting rumors about my origins, but truthfully, I am just a normal consultant working in the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor whom the gods blessed with a very powerful geo vision. (Zhongli has a fake vision that he “uses” whenever he fights).
                    He has a (of course fake) vision though.
                    > when he's just some old guy who doesn't even have a vision.

He has a fake vision.
                He has great expertise in burying previously living things, one could say
            Amen to that
            Zhongli: "I would like to make a reservation".

        In Xiao's trailer/demo, where the story of the Yaksha is told, there is a giant purple remains of a god.
    Dead *Things. By the end of Genshin, Osial's family will probably be buried under the sea.
        Beisht didn't die, she runs away after fighting Shenhe and the Traveler
            She'll be back in a few lantern rites
                Maybe she'll move on. Maybe we'll see her in Fontaine dating a squid or something.
                    >!Elynas!< gets revived by the Abyss Order, hooks up with Beisht, and they elope to the Dark Sea together.
                        And make a bunch more cute creatures because Elynas liked being a dad
                Ningguang: oh boy, here I go dropping another Jade Chamber again!

        Osial is about to get the Crota treatment.
            Aiat!
            Can’t wait to fuck him up next week
    At least I didn't have to look far before running into this comment.

Poor, forgotten Osial. Out of sight, out of mind, I guess. Though I'd say Guyun Stone Forest is one hell of a grave marker.
    Sea burial.
    Maybe later on we will face “dead” under the sea in liyue :))
    Underwater Liyue foreshadowing?
    That, and the enormous thing under the tree
    Man I hope fontaine powers somehow extend in the future so we can go explore there
    There's also Chi, buried under mountains, and Azdahaha, shoved face-first into the dirt and buried there.
We forgor  :(
    Nah OP forgot. Then they made you think you forgot by presenting what appeared to be evidence.

We killed 2 giant sea serpents, and pretended a smol dragon was Rex Lapis, and saw 2 Jade Chambers in a lifetime. And don't forget the entire northern countryside and several aspects of Liyue are related to the Chi dragon. That's a big dragon.
also chi
That’s just what they want you to think.

Literally.  From a lore standpoint haha.  Morax that trickster with his endless mora yet no mora.
    F*cker is hiding all that mora down there
        If there isn’t enough it won’t cave in like memory foam when he sleeps on it
oh yea :(
dead-beat?
As in his cake?
OR WAS HE?
I mean he probably feels pretty dead inside
he has an enormous thing yeah
Rex lapis was just better at hiding them and making them look more aesthetic lol
Damn what a throwback
Actually what is that round thing in the middle ?
    Probably something like a heart or something
What's that
    The congealed blood of a dragon-like monster that Morax sealed near Qingce Village

>"...Rex Lapis overcame the Chi, but the Chi could not perish in its entirety. Thus did Rex Lapis conquer each of its facets in turn: its spirit was bound in the north, its bones were pinned in the south-east, its flesh was incarcerated in the north-west, its soul was fettered in the north-east, and its form was crushed in the south-west..."  
>  
>"...Its bones pierced, its spirit faded, its form and soul both decimated... still did its flesh survive..."
        If I'm not mistaken it's on Baizhu story quests.
            It's located in the north of Qingce village, near a waterfall with an entrance. The domain in Baizhu's story quest isn't associated with it though
                The domain in Baizhu's story quest contains blood that had leaked into that cavern/cave/ruins from the Chi and that's what was used to make the poison.

>Xiao: So someone has been concocting demonic poison...  
>  
>Xiao: Too often, fervent desires drive mortals to abandon all regard for their own safety... It is lamentable.  
>  
>Xiao: I now know what you seek. It is true that a god's remains are buried beneath the foundations of Qingce Village.  
>  
>Xiao: A vile monster known as the Chi once wrought havoc over this land, before it was subdued by Rex Lapis...  
>  
>Xiao: The land was finally cleansed of poison when Rex Lapis used statues in his likeness to seal the serpent's remains. Qingce Village was founded sometime after that.  
>  
>Xiao: The seal is still mostly intact. If the Chi is the source, then it must be some of its blood leaking from deep underground.
            Its a world quest that appears in Baizu story.
        Is this the Chi of Yor of the baizhu one?
            It was relevant to his story quest but it's had its own dedicated world quest since 1.0. It used to be called Chi of Guyun before it got renamed in 1.6
    Nightmares, dude, nightmares.

But actually God named Chi that lived in Qingce https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Chi
        bro discombobulated chi and sent it's bits everywhere
now THIS is a fun fact
Also, isn't the "tree" over Azhdaha's domain actually his tail?
I remember that quest, felt like hell back then
Unvoiced world quest. Requires reading comprehension. We don't do that here. 

To be honest, I'm surprised there's so many people in this thread mentioning it.
    I think because that quest absolutely obliterated a lot of unsuspecting players. It’s definitely one of the most frequent quests I help low AR players on behind Dragonspine’s In the Mountains quest line
    Personally I forgot it ever existed. Once you do that quest and clean out the area of treasure there's 0 reason to care about the place let alone remember it.
    What are you talking about?
    It's also mentioned in Baizhu's SQ, which is voiced.
Not just that but also the >!Sal Terrae disaster!< could also count in my opinion

>!Maybe it’s not a single dead thing but an entire royal court turned to salt is certainly enough salt for me to think it could count!<
    Also the dust cloud over Cuijue slope might possibly be Guizhong.
So entered thru Azdhaha's butt?
    Precisely
        Eastern Mythology: The anus is the gateway to the soul, not joking

It's why the "Headless" boss in Sekiro executes him  has a deadly anus grab attack
            Played Sekiro after watching Sarazanmai and knew exactly what was going down.

For those who haven’t seen the anime, three boys get cursed and have to help quell grumpy spirits by pulling an orb from their butt.
                Never thought I'd see a fellow Sarazanmai enjoyer in the wild
                    There are literally dozens of us! Dozens!
                Fellow sarazanmai enjoyer! That show was so goood
            And then there's the Kappa.
            ...I mean, it's fair, since you'll react far more to anything entering your anus
                Unless you're Thanos, because sending Ant Man up there somehow isn't going to kill him.
            And that's why we have the dung eater in ER
        Lmao
        We Ant-Man'd him.
    In other words, his Azz-dha-hole
Off topic but before one of the updates I would always find a chicken wing in the pond next to azdaha.

Then one update came, not sure which, and there was no more daily chicken wings. 


Anyone else had this?
    Sometimes the bird landed in water instead of land and it died instantly. I dont know when was the last time i checked.
        Seems to corroborate with what others say. I guess one update fixed it entire for me
        Oh my god is THAT what happened? I shot that bird once, years ago, but I was too lazy to run and pick up the chicken wings so I left them there. This whole time I thought it was just the years-old chicken wings I couldn't be bothered to pick up.
            I'm sure i witnessed its death at least once or twice.
    It's nothing lore related. It's a spawn time thing. The birbs are supposed to spawn on top of the rock in the middle of the pool but at times, the assets would spawn late and the birbs, would fall directly in the pool resulting in instant chicken wings.
        Wouldn’t they then still spawn on the rock though? Or did they spawn inside it or something?

I mean not that I don’t believe you just curious how that bug works/worked.
            The bird itself might spawn in a slightly off spot, too. I remember going fishing in Sumeru outside of the Aranara village, and sometimes I'd see cranes underneath the water, then die when I approached the fishing spot.
        Hmn makes sense to me I guess. I suppose one update fixed it on my end hence no more single chicken wing


My head cannon was that they were feeding it to the tree
    Yes if you go there fast enough you will see the living bird fly down to the pond but somehow always land in the deepest area and so ensue chicken wing drop animation
        I usually just TP to the nearest area and casually walk around. Always had the chicken wing no matter how I approached the pond. Then one update it stopped spawning completely.

But your post with someone else's explanation makes sense to me
    Happens in random places, was on watasumi island the other day and a crane went to land on the beach and was too far in the water and watched him poof into chicken legs before my eyes.
        That's hilarious. I never got to witness it in real time. So I was always wondering why there were chicken wings in the middle of a pond and only at the pool by azdaha. (It never happened to me anywhere else)
            Someone else in the thread says it happens when assets don't load in before the bird does so they land in the water before the rock can spawn in.
    I just saw this, but I remembered this was actually investigated by keqingmains waaay back, more than 2 years ago now lmao.

https://library.keqingmains.com/evidence/general-mechanics/miscellaneous-entries#ded-bird
Does he count as being alive or dead?
    I don't know if we know the details, but dragons don't seem to die when they die. We >!speak to Elynas!< and I think Durin's mind is still kicking around.
        Ignoring the time honored rule of "People die when they are killed", SMH
            “Did you really think killing me would make me die?”
            Well, they aren't "people" in the first place
            Cause they are not "people".

Which is the implication of the statement which is often taken out of context.
        If the Breacher Primus have nothing in common with any Teyvat lifeforms and they are Elynas’ cells then Elynas itself is an alien and should not be compared to Sovereign related dragons, but might have more in common with artificial ones like Durin if Rhinedottr used it’s kind as a base.
            >!if you speak with elynas, he talks about his mother. that mother says the same things she said to durin. ergo, rhinedottir is the mother of both durin and elynas. she didn't use him as a base (unless you mean, he might have been her first successful creation, and then she used the same formulas for others - then maybe. but he is more of a true dottore's segment, than a scaramouche to dottore, if we are to compare the two experiments of creation). she found his consciousness out in the open cosmos, but gave him the body like durin, and put his consciousness there. so the two of them have everything in common.!<
                So aliens aren’t real? :(
        >!that could be an abyss creature/gold's creation thing though, since neuvillette is almost definitely the hydro sovereign/very powerful hydro dragon, it seems like dragons (at least powerful ones) get reborn, and abyss creatures stick around as ghosts, possibly the state they were in before gold did stuff with them.!<
            >!it also could be all dragons, though. azhdaha's spirit is still kicking. also, durin and elynas are still dragons, albeit artificial with abyssal powers. we don't know why rhine created them. she might have tried to create a power balance between sovereigns and abyss, and managed to make some counterparts to already existing dragons? we might find more and more in the future. either way, it might be the fate of dragons specifically, even artificial.!<
    *Sealed*  


Not alive because his soul is in an adepti realm.
    I mean they're counting the Ruin Golems here and we still operated then.
Oh is it just his spirit we fight? I just assumed they scaled him down for gameplay purposes
    Well, the technical reason is what gave the lore explanation. Would be a bummer having him smaller than Stormterror in canon, considering the description he was given.
I recall there being something I read that stated that tree was sprung from the bodies of three dead gods and not just Azhdaha. Did I just make that up in my head or mistakenly attribute it for something else?
    You might be thinking of the Harvisptokhm in the northern Sumeru desert, made from the Lord of Amrita, Lord of Verdure and the Goddess of Flowers
        Thanks for the reply. It's been a bit since I did any lorediving.
Where is it stated that the azhdaha we fought was a spirit projection?
    Literally the domain is an adepti realm.
        And? How does that mean that it's azhdaha's spirit that we're fighting?
            Literally the domain is an adepti realm.
                Irrelevant. Azhdaha was physically brought to the cavernous realm before the entrance was sealed. I'm assuming you're just trolling now.
                    He is physically buried on the valley, hence the tremors happening on the Vishap event and continuing on Zhongli's second quest. it's literally his seal breaking off, and we only fight him after the little girl enters the realm and becomes the Azhdaha we fight. I'm not trolling, the explanation is that we don't enter a cave, instead we enter an adeptus realm that is the seal keeping his body dead
                        We're literally said to have entered a cave that has an entrance blocked off by an ancient seal. That's literally the same exact place that azhdaha is described to be sealed at. The size difference could just be argued for be downscaled for gameplay purposes like most large bosses are in this game.

I will admit I forgot about the fact that he literally turns back into the girl after defeat and zhongli calling the girl azhdaha's power incarnate, but it being an "adeptus realm" has nothing to do with it and isn't an explanation, hence why I assumed you were trolling.
                            Well, he's buried beneath the valley, nothing stops it being inside a cavern, but well, if we were to fight him physically, he'd end up being prime geovishap+ in lore as well. Also because the crucial detail is that the seal weakening made earthquakes happen in Liyue, and that was yet another lore quest on a limited event.  Either way, he's indeed downscalled for technical limitations, it'd be so great if instead we had another kaiju battle aside from Dvalin.
where do we learn that its his spirit projection?
I think his wife is still kicking
    Osial is still alive too, he was just resealed after the chamber dropped on him. After that is >!when the Abyss was wanting to transform him into Mecha Osial!<.
        I really hope we see an alternate future at some point where that actually happened, it’s too cool to just be mentioned in one quest.
            I have a feeling he’s going to get a human form like the other gods in liyue have been getting of late and a less powerful form of him becomes a hydro unit,

Make him a massive tsundere who bickers with zhongli for added comedy
                Records of Jueyun Vol 2 speaks of a Sea God with a fairly empathetic personality who may or may not have been Osial... It would be nice to see that expanded into a playable character.
                    I get the impression he’s mad at Morax but they might have been friends prior to the war. It would be funny to see them sat at a table like we had the archons at dinner during lantern rite, just jabbing at each other
                        Hu Tao: Zhongli, could you please pass the salt to our guest?

Zhongli: *laughs quietly*

Osial disguised as a human: Be careful not to drop it in the ocean, too.
    Yep, wife ran off
        KILL WIFE!  


Wife gone.  


Think about wife...
Na he ain't ded.
zl doesn't really "kill" gods because he knows how much they fuck up the environment, he just seals them
won't happen but now i really want an undersea expansion in liyue for this...
It seems that all creatures from the abyss don't really seem to understand the harm they are doing. Elynas and Durin both just wanted to feel the sun and live with everyone on the surface. Also, when they did start destroying things, they experienced it as a strange dream and really didn't understand what was happening. It really makes me sad for them.
    The fact that Elynas is still just having a grand ol’ time even when dead is really something. Even more so when he’s like, “Yo Jakob is about to revive me and I really miss him. That’s cool and all but then my resurrected organs would crush and reabsorb my adorable children and their village so could you stop him from reviving me? Thanks”
        The way he talks about Jakob is cute. "Oh that abyss boy ate me. I hope he likes it. Now he's waking me up to say thank you. That's nice."
        I really like Elynas. Dude's living vicariously through his children in the best way possible.

I would really like to see his original form at some point.
    Does abyss creatures is some kind of cosmic entity shit (chutlu and every space octopus thingy) but at the same time, it goes both ways


Mortal comprehension will never understand the abyss and will end up being insane.


At the same time these creatures also didn't understand why they accidentally cause a genocide and environment pollution while just chilling and sunbathing.
    Durin was poisoned/corrupted, had he not been he wouldn't have cause so much destruction.
        Was Durin poisoned? I thought he was made with abyssal energy since his blood was full of it
            His blood was full of it because of what Gold/Rhindottir did. Durin "woke up" from the fatal blow Dvalin inflicted on him.

"*Even after he woke to find that he had been dealt a killing blow by Dvalin, Durin held no ill will toward Dvalin or Barbatos and only wished that they could have met under better circumstances.*"
                I don't think he was poisoned.

Dragonspine Spear

>"Now then, this great blessing that pulses through my veins,"
>
>"And lovely sight of the dark universe that gave me birth..."

>"They are now yours to inherit." 

So just like Elynas, Durin's entire world was the Abyss before being brought up to the surface. I think it's more like a Simurgh situation where, like Rukkhadevata, Gold fashioned a form for these Abyssal creatures.

                    Lol rhinedottire really looking sus now isnt she

She's singlehandedly responsible for the cataclysms of 2 different nations.... that we know of.

\#1 worst mom award
                        She seems like a horrible person but her "Children" speak so highly of her: Durin, Elynas, Albedo.
                        More than that, she's also indirectly responsible for the whole Mondstadt AQ, since Dvalin was poisoned and corrupted from his wounds from the Durin fight

In fontaine too she released a giant dragon which was most likely cataclysmic, and we still don't know the full extent of her involvement in whatever the fuck happened in Kaen'riah 500years ago. So that's at least three regions so far and maybe more if she was an active part of the Kaen'rian disaster that affected every nation without exception
                            Whats the 3rd? I was counting mondstadt and fontaine. I know there were riftwolves in inazuma's cataclysm but their relationship with her vs other abyss monsters seems muddy

And yee elynas's blood leaking into the waters poisoned fontaine, presumably what killed off the oceanids
                                > Whats the 3rd? I was counting mondstadt and fontaine. I know there were riftwolves in inazuma's cataclysm but their relationship with her vs other abyss monsters seems muddy

Golden Wolflord is the connection

“ Hailing from a dark world, this ruler of the black wolves has the power to call upon its followers, its hidden claws, to dissolve space itself and forge a rift through which it may enter. The Wolflord has no name, for it was but one of "Gold"'s unintentional creations, and that is precisely why it is obsessed with invading worlds that do not belong to it and making a name for itself. That said, the wolf pack is far from unintelligent. After suffering a defeat in its previous invasion, a deserted island where no humans or protectors dwell has been selected for them to prepare for their lord's descent.”
                        It doesn’t necessarily make her a bad mom though. The two things we know of that makes her a bad mom arent from Durin and Elynas even though they ended up causing bad things to happen. The worst is her throwing a replica of Albedo into Durin’s stomach but even then, we dont exactly know *why* she did it, only that she objectively did it. Beyond threatening to leave Albedo, Rhinedottoir never actually abuses her children or anything. Durin and Elynas dont even say that she’s a bad person or evil just that they’re grateful
                i am pretty sure that means that his spirit "woke up" after death the same way elynas' spirit did when we talked to him. his body is still dead. and it already was created with abyssal energy, he wasn't poisoned. he *was* the poison.
At least the Melusines now is more thriving with their new adoptive dad
that's the fate of invasive species regardless. even in real world
He is so nice too
Exactly. Like I think that's why Liyue is full of vengeful spirits literally everywhere that Xiao has to stay in Wangshu Inn in the center of Liyue to continually deal with them.
    Liyue is basically a nation built on a graveyard.
        I used to live on top of an old graveyard, it's pretty rad AND annoying when every time there was an issue with a pipe, archeologists had to come in and dig out those bones and we'd have massive hole in the ground for months. 😂
    If Inazuma had a Xiao, maybe Yashiori and Tararasuna wouldn't be so abandoned.
        Then again, Liyue's pretty empty for the most part
And azdaha
    We still fight him so I don’t think he counts as he’s not dead
        He is as dead as elynas. We fought his spirit as his actual body is much greater in size( the tree is his tail)
            So we enter the bossfight through... his a##hole
            So azdaha is a stand user
            That’s big
            >We fought his spirit

Where is this stated? His size could simply be downscaled for gameplay purposes.
                In Zhongli's 2nd story quest. Azhdaha's soul was split into 2 parts, the good and the bad. The good went into Kun Jun, and the bad formed into a little girl. That little girl then turned into the Azhdaha that we fought, while the good one fought alongside us, so we only fought half his soul, making him smaller than what he actually is.
                Jiu (which turns into the boss) and Kun Jun were polar opposites of his soul. Neither were the actual physical Azhdaha
But we only see the remaining rock spearhead things and not whatever fallen beings Zhongli fought
Yep, and each is a tombstone for a fallen God

Zhongli tells us this, I think at the end of his story quest 1
Also salt god’s tomb in Sal Terrae.
All of them are properly sealed. Not dead nor spewing corrosive substances around. Zhongli did his job well.
    Adding onto this, Liyue also has a *number* of extant internal agents who's only job is to SPECIFICALLY make sure that all of the negative karma and harmful energies *stay* sealed. The Exorcist clan, Cloud Retainer's students, the Wansheng Funeral Parlor (that now has Zhongli himself on payroll), Xiao... all of them engaged in actual karmic and spiritual cleanup constantly.

And some tiny breakouts *do* still occur - and are quickly and swiftly dealt with. Monstadt doesn't have the manpower at the moment and considers Dragonspine mostly contained (it is), Inazuma chose to try and use the energies for more productive purposes (thanks to Dottore), Sumeru is trying to actively research into and contain sites with people more interested in study then containment, and Fontaine just seems happy to not think about the problem (for the moment) and has somewhat more concerning extant issues (the prophecy).

Liyue's got it's crap together. God of Contracts took this job as seriously as he does anything else he signs paperwork to do, apparently.
        NotChina is the mightiest and grandest nation after all. Their social problem amounts to "elderly folks are a bit lonely in their idyllic village" and "citizens are so dutiful and diligent that they overwork themselves sometimes, but the ruling class is perfectly benevolent and wise though". Glory to the CCP.
            Literally the Liyue archon quest was zhongli literally staging his own death to retire because his Nation is so perfect it needs no more god to change it.
                Glorious Liyue, so so much better than the rest of Teyvat.
Yep. You can see the guy’s skull
    Don’t forget the ribs you can see elsewhere on the island
    But that look more like a dragon,he look more like his daughters
        He doesn’t actually look like a melusine, but he loves them so chooses to take that form
            How they was born when he died ?
                It didn’t happen immediately.  >!There was a big battle inside his body between two factions some time after he died that left shards of shrapnel from exploded robots stabbed all over his insides, the melusines were born from those wounds, they’re basically walking talking scabs/cysts.!<
                    Gross
                    THATS WHAT THEY ARE?? Why tf are they so cute then? 🤧
        He also said that he hopes that we get to see his true form or something like that near the end of their world quest
        He's actually that dragon. The form he took was just an avatar of sorts.
            Oh
        He just takes the form of them.
Especially with how damn functional the one in Hadramaveth actually was. That thing traversed across the whole Desert.
Yeah, to me it’s either “big dead things” (Dragonspine, Yashiori, Elynas) or “massive incurable voids” (the Chasm, the Desert of Hadramaveth). It’ll be interesting to see if we get big void in Fontaine
For some reason I thought that tree was Azhdaha’s tail
    Because it is
    Confirmed to indeed be his tail.
    Azhdaha used its Elemental affinity to merge its tail to the tree as a way of absorbing ley line energy,  if I remember.  Its why the tree is still there post-fight.
Someone mentioned before the chasm is aszdaha's butt hole, and I could no longer unsee it
Not only do they not count as dead (because they aren't alive to begin with), even if they did, none of the three are completely inactive. You turn on various systems of all of them and even move one around.
Properly buried/sealed, not accessible to the public. My man's zhongli gets the job done. He deserves that retirement
Man also just wanted to retire and not unalived fr
That's not unique to Sumeru. Local specialties from Liyue also doesn't need to apply element to harvest, although it's far more effective and faster to use Geo to get Cor Lapis, it isn't necessary.

thats it give me your phone
        NO
            YES
bro just threw them to the sea
    Furina: what the f#ck, Morax?
    Nah, they were already in the sea. He tried to bury them properly. Look at the stone forest.
What, like the chasm?
    all the dead gods mashed together in Guyun Stone Forest 💀
        Except for the salt god, she has her own mausoleum
            The Salt Goddess’s story was so sad 😭😭😭
                [deleted]
                    I did the story AAAAAAGES ago, but I don’t remember Zhongli being the one that killed her?? I thought it was somebody else that did it
                        It was her own people
                            Ok yeah that’s what I thought! Something like that, not Zhongli
                        He basically bullied weaker deity into suicide.
                            What game afe you playing? She didn't commit suicide nor was pushed to do it by zhongli
                            Mmmmm I don’t recall that
    Less rocky more alien or scorn-ish?
Lowkey hoping Blackcliff Forge has a massive underground that connects to Chasm >! as hinted in Zhongli's voicelines !< and possibly extends to Enkanomiya?
    I forgor did they ever explain what the cave in the chasm was beyond just a cave that vored souls and showed them illusions?
        It was a small device that had been used to lock enemies inside during the Cataclysm.
No, no, Xiao's job is to exorcise the restless spirits of the gods Zhongli buried. We don't want a repeat of what happened in Tatarasuna, right?
yea in liyue they properly buried the big thing underground.
    Very fitting for Geo... and the home of Wangsheng Funeral Parlor.
        Zhongli working over there is starting to make sense now 😭
            Zhongli: Hello I'd like to work here

Hu tao: And what experience do you have with funerals?

Zhongli: I buried a body in the stone forest

Hu tao: Close enough you're hired
                Surely isn't it "*with* the stone forest"? :p
                    Or even "I buried the stone forest in a body"
            [Everyone in Liyue](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi2-prod.mirror.co.uk%2Fincoming%2Farticle10496506.ece%2FALTERNATES%2Fs1200b%2FLittle-girl-from-side-eye-meme-all-grown-up.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=83cb1774e9216d6a92488e313e2399afa8506f6604672dbc2b78e0edac1d7ff3&ipo=images) 10 seconds after asking themselves why the assistant at the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor has an OP geo element genius invokaction card when he's just some old guy who doesn't even have a vision.
                Zhongli: There has been a lot of interesting rumors about my origins, but truthfully, I am just a normal consultant working in the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor whom the gods blessed with a very powerful geo vision. (Zhongli has a fake vision that he “uses” whenever he fights).
                He has a (of course fake) vision though.
                > when he's just some old guy who doesn't even have a vision.

He has a fake vision.
            He has great expertise in burying previously living things, one could say
        Amen to that
        Zhongli: "I would like to make a reservation".
    Swimming with the fishes
    In Xiao's trailer/demo, where the story of the Yaksha is told, there is a giant purple remains of a god.
Dead *Things. By the end of Genshin, Osial's family will probably be buried under the sea.
    Beisht didn't die, she runs away after fighting Shenhe and the Traveler
        She'll be back in a few lantern rites
            Maybe she'll move on. Maybe we'll see her in Fontaine dating a squid or something.
                >!Elynas!< gets revived by the Abyss Order, hooks up with Beisht, and they elope to the Dark Sea together.
                    And make a bunch more cute creatures because Elynas liked being a dad
            Ningguang: oh boy, here I go dropping another Jade Chamber again!
                Beisht best girl out there creating construction jobs.
    Osial is about to get the Crota treatment.
        Aiat!
        Can’t wait to fuck him up next week
At least I didn't have to look far before running into this comment.

Poor, forgotten Osial. Out of sight, out of mind, I guess. Though I'd say Guyun Stone Forest is one hell of a grave marker.
Sea burial.
Maybe later on we will face “dead” under the sea in liyue :))
Underwater Liyue foreshadowing?
That, and the enormous thing under the tree
Man I hope fontaine powers somehow extend in the future so we can go explore there
There's also Chi, buried under mountains, and Azdahaha, shoved face-first into the dirt and buried there.
Nah OP forgot. Then they made you think you forgot by presenting what appeared to be evidence.

We killed 2 giant sea serpents, and pretended a smol dragon was Rex Lapis, and saw 2 Jade Chambers in a lifetime. And don't forget the entire northern countryside and several aspects of Liyue are related to the Chi dragon. That's a big dragon.
F*cker is hiding all that mora down there
    If there isn’t enough it won’t cave in like memory foam when he sleeps on it
Probably something like a heart or something
The congealed blood of a dragon-like monster that Morax sealed near Qingce Village

>"...Rex Lapis overcame the Chi, but the Chi could not perish in its entirety. Thus did Rex Lapis conquer each of its facets in turn: its spirit was bound in the north, its bones were pinned in the south-east, its flesh was incarcerated in the north-west, its soul was fettered in the north-east, and its form was crushed in the south-west..."  
>  
>"...Its bones pierced, its spirit faded, its form and soul both decimated... still did its flesh survive..."
    If I'm not mistaken it's on Baizhu story quests.
        It's located in the north of Qingce village, near a waterfall with an entrance. The domain in Baizhu's story quest isn't associated with it though
            The domain in Baizhu's story quest contains blood that had leaked into that cavern/cave/ruins from the Chi and that's what was used to make the poison.

>Xiao: So someone has been concocting demonic poison...  
>  
>Xiao: Too often, fervent desires drive mortals to abandon all regard for their own safety... It is lamentable.  
>  
>Xiao: I now know what you seek. It is true that a god's remains are buried beneath the foundations of Qingce Village.  
>  
>Xiao: A vile monster known as the Chi once wrought havoc over this land, before it was subdued by Rex Lapis...  
>  
>Xiao: The land was finally cleansed of poison when Rex Lapis used statues in his likeness to seal the serpent's remains. Qingce Village was founded sometime after that.  
>  
>Xiao: The seal is still mostly intact. If the Chi is the source, then it must be some of its blood leaking from deep underground.
        Its a world quest that appears in Baizu story.
    Is this the Chi of Yor of the baizhu one?
        It was relevant to his story quest but it's had its own dedicated world quest since 1.0. It used to be called Chi of Guyun before it got renamed in 1.6
Nightmares, dude, nightmares.

But actually God named Chi that lived in Qingce https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Chi
    bro discombobulated chi and sent it's bits everywhere
I think because that quest absolutely obliterated a lot of unsuspecting players. It’s definitely one of the most frequent quests I help low AR players on behind Dragonspine’s In the Mountains quest line
Personally I forgot it ever existed. Once you do that quest and clean out the area of treasure there's 0 reason to care about the place let alone remember it.
What are you talking about?
It's also mentioned in Baizhu's SQ, which is voiced.
Also the dust cloud over Cuijue slope might possibly be Guizhong.
Precisely
    Eastern Mythology: The anus is the gateway to the soul, not joking

It's why the "Headless" boss in Sekiro executes him  has a deadly anus grab attack
        Played Sekiro after watching Sarazanmai and knew exactly what was going down.

For those who haven’t seen the anime, three boys get cursed and have to help quell grumpy spirits by pulling an orb from their butt.
            Never thought I'd see a fellow Sarazanmai enjoyer in the wild
                There are literally dozens of us! Dozens!
            Fellow sarazanmai enjoyer! That show was so goood
        And then there's the Kappa.
        ...I mean, it's fair, since you'll react far more to anything entering your anus
            Unless you're Thanos, because sending Ant Man up there somehow isn't going to kill him.
        And that's why we have the dung eater in ER
    Lmao
    We Ant-Man'd him.
In other words, his Azz-dha-hole
Sometimes the bird landed in water instead of land and it died instantly. I dont know when was the last time i checked.
    Seems to corroborate with what others say. I guess one update fixed it entire for me
    Oh my god is THAT what happened? I shot that bird once, years ago, but I was too lazy to run and pick up the chicken wings so I left them there. This whole time I thought it was just the years-old chicken wings I couldn't be bothered to pick up.
        I'm sure i witnessed its death at least once or twice.
It's nothing lore related. It's a spawn time thing. The birbs are supposed to spawn on top of the rock in the middle of the pool but at times, the assets would spawn late and the birbs, would fall directly in the pool resulting in instant chicken wings.
    Wouldn’t they then still spawn on the rock though? Or did they spawn inside it or something?

I mean not that I don’t believe you just curious how that bug works/worked.
        The bird itself might spawn in a slightly off spot, too. I remember going fishing in Sumeru outside of the Aranara village, and sometimes I'd see cranes underneath the water, then die when I approached the fishing spot.
    Hmn makes sense to me I guess. I suppose one update fixed it on my end hence no more single chicken wing


My head cannon was that they were feeding it to the tree
Yes if you go there fast enough you will see the living bird fly down to the pond but somehow always land in the deepest area and so ensue chicken wing drop animation
    I usually just TP to the nearest area and casually walk around. Always had the chicken wing no matter how I approached the pond. Then one update it stopped spawning completely.

But your post with someone else's explanation makes sense to me
Happens in random places, was on watasumi island the other day and a crane went to land on the beach and was too far in the water and watched him poof into chicken legs before my eyes.
    That's hilarious. I never got to witness it in real time. So I was always wondering why there were chicken wings in the middle of a pond and only at the pool by azdaha. (It never happened to me anywhere else)
        Someone else in the thread says it happens when assets don't load in before the bird does so they land in the water before the rock can spawn in.
I just saw this, but I remembered this was actually investigated by keqingmains waaay back, more than 2 years ago now lmao.

https://library.keqingmains.com/evidence/general-mechanics/miscellaneous-entries#ded-bird
I don't know if we know the details, but dragons don't seem to die when they die. We >!speak to Elynas!< and I think Durin's mind is still kicking around.
    Ignoring the time honored rule of "People die when they are killed", SMH
        “Did you really think killing me would make me die?”
        Well, they aren't "people" in the first place
        Cause they are not "people".

Which is the implication of the statement which is often taken out of context.
    If the Breacher Primus have nothing in common with any Teyvat lifeforms and they are Elynas’ cells then Elynas itself is an alien and should not be compared to Sovereign related dragons, but might have more in common with artificial ones like Durin if Rhinedottr used it’s kind as a base.
        >!if you speak with elynas, he talks about his mother. that mother says the same things she said to durin. ergo, rhinedottir is the mother of both durin and elynas. she didn't use him as a base (unless you mean, he might have been her first successful creation, and then she used the same formulas for others - then maybe. but he is more of a true dottore's segment, than a scaramouche to dottore, if we are to compare the two experiments of creation). she found his consciousness out in the open cosmos, but gave him the body like durin, and put his consciousness there. so the two of them have everything in common.!<
            So aliens aren’t real? :(
    >!that could be an abyss creature/gold's creation thing though, since neuvillette is almost definitely the hydro sovereign/very powerful hydro dragon, it seems like dragons (at least powerful ones) get reborn, and abyss creatures stick around as ghosts, possibly the state they were in before gold did stuff with them.!<
        >!it also could be all dragons, though. azhdaha's spirit is still kicking. also, durin and elynas are still dragons, albeit artificial with abyssal powers. we don't know why rhine created them. she might have tried to create a power balance between sovereigns and abyss, and managed to make some counterparts to already existing dragons? we might find more and more in the future. either way, it might be the fate of dragons specifically, even artificial.!<
*Sealed*  


Not alive because his soul is in an adepti realm.
I mean they're counting the Ruin Golems here and we still operated then.
Well, the technical reason is what gave the lore explanation. Would be a bummer having him smaller than Stormterror in canon, considering the description he was given.
You might be thinking of the Harvisptokhm in the northern Sumeru desert, made from the Lord of Amrita, Lord of Verdure and the Goddess of Flowers
    Thanks for the reply. It's been a bit since I did any lorediving.
Literally the domain is an adepti realm.
    And? How does that mean that it's azhdaha's spirit that we're fighting?
        Literally the domain is an adepti realm.
            Irrelevant. Azhdaha was physically brought to the cavernous realm before the entrance was sealed. I'm assuming you're just trolling now.
                He is physically buried on the valley, hence the tremors happening on the Vishap event and continuing on Zhongli's second quest. it's literally his seal breaking off, and we only fight him after the little girl enters the realm and becomes the Azhdaha we fight. I'm not trolling, the explanation is that we don't enter a cave, instead we enter an adeptus realm that is the seal keeping his body dead
                    We're literally said to have entered a cave that has an entrance blocked off by an ancient seal. That's literally the same exact place that azhdaha is described to be sealed at. The size difference could just be argued for be downscaled for gameplay purposes like most large bosses are in this game.

I will admit I forgot about the fact that he literally turns back into the girl after defeat and zhongli calling the girl azhdaha's power incarnate, but it being an "adeptus realm" has nothing to do with it and isn't an explanation, hence why I assumed you were trolling.
                        Well, he's buried beneath the valley, nothing stops it being inside a cavern, but well, if we were to fight him physically, he'd end up being prime geovishap+ in lore as well. Also because the crucial detail is that the seal weakening made earthquakes happen in Liyue, and that was yet another lore quest on a limited event.  Either way, he's indeed downscalled for technical limitations, it'd be so great if instead we had another kaiju battle aside from Dvalin.
Osial is still alive too, he was just resealed after the chamber dropped on him. After that is >!when the Abyss was wanting to transform him into Mecha Osial!<.
    I really hope we see an alternate future at some point where that actually happened, it’s too cool to just be mentioned in one quest.
        I have a feeling he’s going to get a human form like the other gods in liyue have been getting of late and a less powerful form of him becomes a hydro unit,

Make him a massive tsundere who bickers with zhongli for added comedy
            Records of Jueyun Vol 2 speaks of a Sea God with a fairly empathetic personality who may or may not have been Osial... It would be nice to see that expanded into a playable character.
                I get the impression he’s mad at Morax but they might have been friends prior to the war. It would be funny to see them sat at a table like we had the archons at dinner during lantern rite, just jabbing at each other
                    Hu Tao: Zhongli, could you please pass the salt to our guest?

Zhongli: *laughs quietly*

Osial disguised as a human: Be careful not to drop it in the ocean, too.
Yep, wife ran off
    KILL WIFE!  


Wife gone.  


Think about wife...
The fact that Elynas is still just having a grand ol’ time even when dead is really something. Even more so when he’s like, “Yo Jakob is about to revive me and I really miss him. That’s cool and all but then my resurrected organs would crush and reabsorb my adorable children and their village so could you stop him from reviving me? Thanks”
    The way he talks about Jakob is cute. "Oh that abyss boy ate me. I hope he likes it. Now he's waking me up to say thank you. That's nice."
    I really like Elynas. Dude's living vicariously through his children in the best way possible.

I would really like to see his original form at some point.
Does abyss creatures is some kind of cosmic entity shit (chutlu and every space octopus thingy) but at the same time, it goes both ways


Mortal comprehension will never understand the abyss and will end up being insane.


At the same time these creatures also didn't understand why they accidentally cause a genocide and environment pollution while just chilling and sunbathing.
Durin was poisoned/corrupted, had he not been he wouldn't have cause so much destruction.
    Was Durin poisoned? I thought he was made with abyssal energy since his blood was full of it
        His blood was full of it because of what Gold/Rhindottir did. Durin "woke up" from the fatal blow Dvalin inflicted on him.

"*Even after he woke to find that he had been dealt a killing blow by Dvalin, Durin held no ill will toward Dvalin or Barbatos and only wished that they could have met under better circumstances.*"
            I don't think he was poisoned.

Dragonspine Spear

>"Now then, this great blessing that pulses through my veins,"
>
>"And lovely sight of the dark universe that gave me birth..."
>
>"They are now yours to inherit." 

So just like Elynas, Durin's entire world was the Abyss before being brought up to the surface. I think it's more like a Simurgh situation where, like Rukkhadevata, Gold fashioned a form for these Abyssal creatures.

Festering Desire
>"Thank you, Mother, thank you."

>"You gave me wings to soar and a mighty form."

>"I shall tell them that the place where I was born is beautiful."
                Lol rhinedottire really looking sus now isnt she

She's singlehandedly responsible for the cataclysms of 2 different nations.... that we know of.

\#1 worst mom award
                    She seems like a horrible person but her "Children" speak so highly of her: Durin, Elynas, Albedo.
                    More than that, she's also indirectly responsible for the whole Mondstadt AQ, since Dvalin was poisoned and corrupted from his wounds from the Durin fight

In fontaine too she released a giant dragon which was most likely cataclysmic, and we still don't know the full extent of her involvement in whatever the fuck happened in Kaen'riah 500years ago. So that's at least three regions so far and maybe more if she was an active part of the Kaen'rian disaster that affected every nation without exception
                        Whats the 3rd? I was counting mondstadt and fontaine. I know there were riftwolves in inazuma's cataclysm but their relationship with her vs other abyss monsters seems muddy

And yee elynas's blood leaking into the waters poisoned fontaine, presumably what killed off the oceanids
                            > Whats the 3rd? I was counting mondstadt and fontaine. I know there were riftwolves in inazuma's cataclysm but their relationship with her vs other abyss monsters seems muddy

Golden Wolflord is the connection

“ Hailing from a dark world, this ruler of the black wolves has the power to call upon its followers, its hidden claws, to dissolve space itself and forge a rift through which it may enter. The Wolflord has no name, for it was but one of "Gold"'s unintentional creations, and that is precisely why it is obsessed with invading worlds that do not belong to it and making a name for itself. That said, the wolf pack is far from unintelligent. After suffering a defeat in its previous invasion, a deserted island where no humans or protectors dwell has been selected for them to prepare for their lord's descent.”
                    It doesn’t necessarily make her a bad mom though. The two things we know of that makes her a bad mom arent from Durin and Elynas even though they ended up causing bad things to happen. The worst is her throwing a replica of Albedo into Durin’s stomach but even then, we dont exactly know *why* she did it, only that she objectively did it. Beyond threatening to leave Albedo, Rhinedottoir never actually abuses her children or anything. Durin and Elynas dont even say that she’s a bad person or evil just that they’re grateful
            i am pretty sure that means that his spirit "woke up" after death the same way elynas' spirit did when we talked to him. his body is still dead. and it already was created with abyssal energy, he wasn't poisoned. he *was* the poison.
Liyue is basically a nation built on a graveyard.
    I used to live on top of an old graveyard, it's pretty rad AND annoying when every time there was an issue with a pipe, archeologists had to come in and dig out those bones and we'd have massive hole in the ground for months. 😂
If Inazuma had a Xiao, maybe Yashiori and Tararasuna wouldn't be so abandoned.
    Then again, Liyue's pretty empty for the most part
We still fight him so I don’t think he counts as he’s not dead
    He is as dead as elynas. We fought his spirit as his actual body is much greater in size( the tree is his tail)
        So we enter the bossfight through... his a##hole
        So azdaha is a stand user
        That’s big
        >We fought his spirit

Where is this stated? His size could simply be downscaled for gameplay purposes.
            In Zhongli's 2nd story quest. Azhdaha's soul was split into 2 parts, the good and the bad. The good went into Kun Jun, and the bad formed into a little girl. That little girl then turned into the Azhdaha that we fought, while the good one fought alongside us, so we only fought half his soul, making him smaller than what he actually is.
            Jiu (which turns into the boss) and Kun Jun were polar opposites of his soul. Neither were the actual physical Azhdaha
Adding onto this, Liyue also has a *number* of extant internal agents who's only job is to SPECIFICALLY make sure that all of the negative karma and harmful energies *stay* sealed. The Exorcist clan, Cloud Retainer's students, the Wansheng Funeral Parlor (that now has Zhongli himself on payroll), Xiao... all of them engaged in actual karmic and spiritual cleanup constantly.

And some tiny breakouts *do* still occur - and are quickly and swiftly dealt with. Monstadt doesn't have the manpower at the moment and considers Dragonspine mostly contained (it is), Inazuma chose to try and use the energies for more productive purposes (thanks to Dottore), Sumeru is trying to actively research into and contain sites with people more interested in study then containment, and Fontaine just seems happy to not think about the problem (for the moment) and has somewhat more concerning extant issues (the prophecy).

Liyue's got it's crap together. God of Contracts took this job as seriously as he does anything else he signs paperwork to do, apparently.
    NotChina is the mightiest and grandest nation after all. Their social problem amounts to "elderly folks are a bit lonely in their idyllic village" and "citizens are so dutiful and diligent that they overwork themselves sometimes, but the ruling class is perfectly benevolent and wise though". Glory to the CCP.
        Literally the Liyue archon quest was zhongli literally staging his own death to retire because his Nation is so perfect it needs no more god to change it.
            Glorious Liyue, so so much better than the rest of Teyvat.
Don’t forget the ribs you can see elsewhere on the island
But that look more like a dragon,he look more like his daughters
    He doesn’t actually look like a melusine, but he loves them so chooses to take that form
        How they was born when he died ?
            It didn’t happen immediately.  >!There was a big battle inside his body between two factions some time after he died that left shards of shrapnel from exploded robots stabbed all over his insides, the melusines were born from those wounds, they’re basically walking talking scabs/cysts.!<
                Gross
                THATS WHAT THEY ARE?? Why tf are they so cute then? 🤧
    He also said that he hopes that we get to see his true form or something like that near the end of their world quest
    He's actually that dragon. The form he took was just an avatar of sorts.
        Oh
    He just takes the form of them.
Because it is
Confirmed to indeed be his tail.
Azhdaha used its Elemental affinity to merge its tail to the tree as a way of absorbing ley line energy,  if I remember.  Its why the tree is still there post-fight.

Nah, they were already in the sea. He tried to bury them properly. Look at the stone forest.
all the dead gods mashed together in Guyun Stone Forest 💀
    Except for the salt god, she has her own mausoleum
        The Salt Goddess’s story was so sad 😭😭😭
            [deleted]
                I did the story AAAAAAGES ago, but I don’t remember Zhongli being the one that killed her?? I thought it was somebody else that did it
                    It was her own people
                        Ok yeah that’s what I thought! Something like that, not Zhongli
                    He basically bullied weaker deity into suicide.
                        What game afe you playing? She didn't commit suicide nor was pushed to do it by zhongli
                        Mmmmm I don’t recall that
Less rocky more alien or scorn-ish?
I forgor did they ever explain what the cave in the chasm was beyond just a cave that vored souls and showed them illusions?
    It was a small device that had been used to lock enemies inside during the Cataclysm.
Very fitting for Geo... and the home of Wangsheng Funeral Parlor.
    Zhongli working over there is starting to make sense now 😭
        Zhongli: Hello I'd like to work here

Hu tao: And what experience do you have with funerals?

Zhongli: I buried a body in the stone forest

Hu tao: Close enough you're hired
            Surely isn't it "*with* the stone forest"? :p
                Or even "I buried the stone forest in a body"
        [Everyone in Liyue](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi2-prod.mirror.co.uk%2Fincoming%2Farticle10496506.ece%2FALTERNATES%2Fs1200b%2FLittle-girl-from-side-eye-meme-all-grown-up.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=83cb1774e9216d6a92488e313e2399afa8506f6604672dbc2b78e0edac1d7ff3&ipo=images) 10 seconds after asking themselves why the assistant at the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor has an OP geo element genius invokaction card when he's just some old guy who doesn't even have a vision.
            Zhongli: There has been a lot of interesting rumors about my origins, but truthfully, I am just a normal consultant working in the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor whom the gods blessed with a very powerful geo vision. (Zhongli has a fake vision that he “uses” whenever he fights).
            He has a (of course fake) vision though.
            > when he's just some old guy who doesn't even have a vision.

He has a fake vision.
        He has great expertise in burying previously living things, one could say
    Amen to that
    Zhongli: "I would like to make a reservation".
Swimming with the fishes
In Xiao's trailer/demo, where the story of the Yaksha is told, there is a giant purple remains of a god.
Beisht didn't die, she runs away after fighting Shenhe and the Traveler
    She'll be back in a few lantern rites
        Maybe she'll move on. Maybe we'll see her in Fontaine dating a squid or something.
            >!Elynas!< gets revived by the Abyss Order, hooks up with Beisht, and they elope to the Dark Sea together.
                And make a bunch more cute creatures because Elynas liked being a dad
        Ningguang: oh boy, here I go dropping another Jade Chamber again!
            Beisht best girl out there creating construction jobs.
Osial is about to get the Crota treatment.
    Aiat!
    Can’t wait to fuck him up next week
If there isn’t enough it won’t cave in like memory foam when he sleeps on it
If I'm not mistaken it's on Baizhu story quests.
    It's located in the north of Qingce village, near a waterfall with an entrance. The domain in Baizhu's story quest isn't associated with it though
        The domain in Baizhu's story quest contains blood that had leaked into that cavern/cave/ruins from the Chi and that's what was used to make the poison.

>Xiao: So someone has been concocting demonic poison...  
>  
>Xiao: Too often, fervent desires drive mortals to abandon all regard for their own safety... It is lamentable.  
>  
>Xiao: I now know what you seek. It is true that a god's remains are buried beneath the foundations of Qingce Village.  
>  
>Xiao: A vile monster known as the Chi once wrought havoc over this land, before it was subdued by Rex Lapis...  
>  
>Xiao: The land was finally cleansed of poison when Rex Lapis used statues in his likeness to seal the serpent's remains. Qingce Village was founded sometime after that.  
>  
>Xiao: The seal is still mostly intact. If the Chi is the source, then it must be some of its blood leaking from deep underground.
    Its a world quest that appears in Baizu story.
Is this the Chi of Yor of the baizhu one?
    It was relevant to his story quest but it's had its own dedicated world quest since 1.0. It used to be called Chi of Guyun before it got renamed in 1.6
bro discombobulated chi and sent it's bits everywhere
Eastern Mythology: The anus is the gateway to the soul, not joking

It's why the "Headless" boss in Sekiro executes him  has a deadly anus grab attack
    Played Sekiro after watching Sarazanmai and knew exactly what was going down.

For those who haven’t seen the anime, three boys get cursed and have to help quell grumpy spirits by pulling an orb from their butt.
        Never thought I'd see a fellow Sarazanmai enjoyer in the wild
            There are literally dozens of us! Dozens!
        Fellow sarazanmai enjoyer! That show was so goood
    And then there's the Kappa.
    ...I mean, it's fair, since you'll react far more to anything entering your anus
        Unless you're Thanos, because sending Ant Man up there somehow isn't going to kill him.
    And that's why we have the dung eater in ER
Lmao
We Ant-Man'd him.
Seems to corroborate with what others say. I guess one update fixed it entire for me
Oh my god is THAT what happened? I shot that bird once, years ago, but I was too lazy to run and pick up the chicken wings so I left them there. This whole time I thought it was just the years-old chicken wings I couldn't be bothered to pick up.
    I'm sure i witnessed its death at least once or twice.
Wouldn’t they then still spawn on the rock though? Or did they spawn inside it or something?

I mean not that I don’t believe you just curious how that bug works/worked.
    The bird itself might spawn in a slightly off spot, too. I remember going fishing in Sumeru outside of the Aranara village, and sometimes I'd see cranes underneath the water, then die when I approached the fishing spot.
Hmn makes sense to me I guess. I suppose one update fixed it on my end hence no more single chicken wing


My head cannon was that they were feeding it to the tree
I usually just TP to the nearest area and casually walk around. Always had the chicken wing no matter how I approached the pond. Then one update it stopped spawning completely.

But your post with someone else's explanation makes sense to me
That's hilarious. I never got to witness it in real time. So I was always wondering why there were chicken wings in the middle of a pond and only at the pool by azdaha. (It never happened to me anywhere else)
    Someone else in the thread says it happens when assets don't load in before the bird does so they land in the water before the rock can spawn in.
Ignoring the time honored rule of "People die when they are killed", SMH
    “Did you really think killing me would make me die?”
    Well, they aren't "people" in the first place
    Cause they are not "people".

Which is the implication of the statement which is often taken out of context.
If the Breacher Primus have nothing in common with any Teyvat lifeforms and they are Elynas’ cells then Elynas itself is an alien and should not be compared to Sovereign related dragons, but might have more in common with artificial ones like Durin if Rhinedottr used it’s kind as a base.
    >!if you speak with elynas, he talks about his mother. that mother says the same things she said to durin. ergo, rhinedottir is the mother of both durin and elynas. she didn't use him as a base (unless you mean, he might have been her first successful creation, and then she used the same formulas for others - then maybe. but he is more of a true dottore's segment, than a scaramouche to dottore, if we are to compare the two experiments of creation). she found his consciousness out in the open cosmos, but gave him the body like durin, and put his consciousness there. so the two of them have everything in common.!<
        So aliens aren’t real? :(
>!that could be an abyss creature/gold's creation thing though, since neuvillette is almost definitely the hydro sovereign/very powerful hydro dragon, it seems like dragons (at least powerful ones) get reborn, and abyss creatures stick around as ghosts, possibly the state they were in before gold did stuff with them.!<
    >!it also could be all dragons, though. azhdaha's spirit is still kicking. also, durin and elynas are still dragons, albeit artificial with abyssal powers. we don't know why rhine created them. she might have tried to create a power balance between sovereigns and abyss, and managed to make some counterparts to already existing dragons? we might find more and more in the future. either way, it might be the fate of dragons specifically, even artificial.!<
Thanks for the reply. It's been a bit since I did any lorediving.
And? How does that mean that it's azhdaha's spirit that we're fighting?
    Literally the domain is an adepti realm.
        Irrelevant. Azhdaha was physically brought to the cavernous realm before the entrance was sealed. I'm assuming you're just trolling now.
            He is physically buried on the valley, hence the tremors happening on the Vishap event and continuing on Zhongli's second quest. it's literally his seal breaking off, and we only fight him after the little girl enters the realm and becomes the Azhdaha we fight. I'm not trolling, the explanation is that we don't enter a cave, instead we enter an adeptus realm that is the seal keeping his body dead
                We're literally said to have entered a cave that has an entrance blocked off by an ancient seal. That's literally the same exact place that azhdaha is described to be sealed at. The size difference could just be argued for be downscaled for gameplay purposes like most large bosses are in this game.

I will admit I forgot about the fact that he literally turns back into the girl after defeat and zhongli calling the girl azhdaha's power incarnate, but it being an "adeptus realm" has nothing to do with it and isn't an explanation, hence why I assumed you were trolling.
                    Well, he's buried beneath the valley, nothing stops it being inside a cavern, but well, if we were to fight him physically, he'd end up being prime geovishap+ in lore as well. Also because the crucial detail is that the seal weakening made earthquakes happen in Liyue, and that was yet another lore quest on a limited event.  Either way, he's indeed downscalled for technical limitations, it'd be so great if instead we had another kaiju battle aside from Dvalin.
I really hope we see an alternate future at some point where that actually happened, it’s too cool to just be mentioned in one quest.
    I have a feeling he’s going to get a human form like the other gods in liyue have been getting of late and a less powerful form of him becomes a hydro unit,

Make him a massive tsundere who bickers with zhongli for added comedy
        Records of Jueyun Vol 2 speaks of a Sea God with a fairly empathetic personality who may or may not have been Osial... It would be nice to see that expanded into a playable character.
            I get the impression he’s mad at Morax but they might have been friends prior to the war. It would be funny to see them sat at a table like we had the archons at dinner during lantern rite, just jabbing at each other
                Hu Tao: Zhongli, could you please pass the salt to our guest?

Zhongli: *laughs quietly*

Osial disguised as a human: Be careful not to drop it in the ocean, too.
KILL WIFE!  


Wife gone.  


Think about wife...
The way he talks about Jakob is cute. "Oh that abyss boy ate me. I hope he likes it. Now he's waking me up to say thank you. That's nice."
I really like Elynas. Dude's living vicariously through his children in the best way possible.

I would really like to see his original form at some point.
Was Durin poisoned? I thought he was made with abyssal energy since his blood was full of it
    His blood was full of it because of what Gold/Rhindottir did. Durin "woke up" from the fatal blow Dvalin inflicted on him.

"*Even after he woke to find that he had been dealt a killing blow by Dvalin, Durin held no ill will toward Dvalin or Barbatos and only wished that they could have met under better circumstances.*"
        I don't think he was poisoned.

Dragonspine Spear

>"Now then, this great blessing that pulses through my veins,"
>
>"And lovely sight of the dark universe that gave me birth..."
>
>"They are now yours to inherit." 

So just like Elynas, Durin's entire world was the Abyss before being brought up to the surface. I think it's more like a Simurgh situation where, like Rukkhadevata, Gold fashioned a form for these Abyssal creatures.

            Lol rhinedottire really looking sus now isnt she

She's singlehandedly responsible for the cataclysms of 2 different nations.... that we know of.

\#1 worst mom award
                She seems like a horrible person but her "Children" speak so highly of her: Durin, Elynas, Albedo.
                More than that, she's also indirectly responsible for the whole Mondstadt AQ, since Dvalin was poisoned and corrupted from his wounds from the Durin fight

In fontaine too she released a giant dragon which was most likely cataclysmic, and we still don't know the full extent of her involvement in whatever the fuck happened in Kaen'riah 500years ago. So that's at least three regions so far and maybe more if she was an active part of the Kaen'rian disaster that affected every nation without exception
                    Whats the 3rd? I was counting mondstadt and fontaine. I know there were riftwolves in inazuma's cataclysm but their relationship with her vs other abyss monsters seems muddy

And yee elynas's blood leaking into the waters poisoned fontaine, presumably what killed off the oceanids
                        > Whats the 3rd? I was counting mondstadt and fontaine. I know there were riftwolves in inazuma's cataclysm but their relationship with her vs other abyss monsters seems muddy

Golden Wolflord is the connection

“ Hailing from a dark world, this ruler of the black wolves has the power to call upon its followers, its hidden claws, to dissolve space itself and forge a rift through which it may enter. The Wolflord has no name, for it was but one of "Gold"'s unintentional creations, and that is precisely why it is obsessed with invading worlds that do not belong to it and making a name for itself. That said, the wolf pack is far from unintelligent. After suffering a defeat in its previous invasion, a deserted island where no humans or protectors dwell has been selected for them to prepare for their lord's descent.”
                It doesn’t necessarily make her a bad mom though. The two things we know of that makes her a bad mom arent from Durin and Elynas even though they ended up causing bad things to happen. The worst is her throwing a replica of Albedo into Durin’s stomach but even then, we dont exactly know *why* she did it, only that she objectively did it. Beyond threatening to leave Albedo, Rhinedottoir never actually abuses her children or anything. Durin and Elynas dont even say that she’s a bad person or evil just that they’re grateful
        i am pretty sure that means that his spirit "woke up" after death the same way elynas' spirit did when we talked to him. his body is still dead. and it already was created with abyssal energy, he wasn't poisoned. he *was* the poison.
I used to live on top of an old graveyard, it's pretty rad AND annoying when every time there was an issue with a pipe, archeologists had to come in and dig out those bones and we'd have massive hole in the ground for months. 😂
Then again, Liyue's pretty empty for the most part
He is as dead as elynas. We fought his spirit as his actual body is much greater in size( the tree is his tail)
    So we enter the bossfight through... his a##hole
    So azdaha is a stand user
    That’s big
    >We fought his spirit

Where is this stated? His size could simply be downscaled for gameplay purposes.
        In Zhongli's 2nd story quest. Azhdaha's soul was split into 2 parts, the good and the bad. The good went into Kun Jun, and the bad formed into a little girl. That little girl then turned into the Azhdaha that we fought, while the good one fought alongside us, so we only fought half his soul, making him smaller than what he actually is.
        Jiu (which turns into the boss) and Kun Jun were polar opposites of his soul. Neither were the actual physical Azhdaha
NotChina is the mightiest and grandest nation after all. Their social problem amounts to "elderly folks are a bit lonely in their idyllic village" and "citizens are so dutiful and diligent that they overwork themselves sometimes, but the ruling class is perfectly benevolent and wise though". Glory to the CCP.
    Literally the Liyue archon quest was zhongli literally staging his own death to retire because his Nation is so perfect it needs no more god to change it.
        Glorious Liyue, so so much better than the rest of Teyvat.
He doesn’t actually look like a melusine, but he loves them so chooses to take that form
    How they was born when he died ?
        It didn’t happen immediately.  >!There was a big battle inside his body between two factions some time after he died that left shards of shrapnel from exploded robots stabbed all over his insides, the melusines were born from those wounds, they’re basically walking talking scabs/cysts.!<
            Gross
            THATS WHAT THEY ARE?? Why tf are they so cute then? 🤧
He also said that he hopes that we get to see his true form or something like that near the end of their world quest
He's actually that dragon. The form he took was just an avatar of sorts.
    Oh
He just takes the form of them.
NO
    YES
Except for the salt god, she has her own mausoleum
    The Salt Goddess’s story was so sad 😭😭😭
        [deleted]
            I did the story AAAAAAGES ago, but I don’t remember Zhongli being the one that killed her?? I thought it was somebody else that did it
                It was her own people
                    Ok yeah that’s what I thought! Something like that, not Zhongli
                He basically bullied weaker deity into suicide.
                    What game afe you playing? She didn't commit suicide nor was pushed to do it by zhongli
                    Mmmmm I don’t recall that
It was a small device that had been used to lock enemies inside during the Cataclysm.

            It doesn’t necessarily make her a bad mom though. The two things we know of that makes her a bad mom arent from Durin and Elynas even though they ended up causing bad things to happen. The worst is her throwing a replica of Albedo into Durin’s stomach but even then, we dont exactly know *why* she did it, only that she objectively did it. Beyond threatening to leave Albedo, Rhinedottoir never actually abuses her children or anything. Durin and Elynas dont even say that she’s a bad person or evil just that they’re grateful
    i am pretty sure that means that his spirit "woke up" after death the same way elynas' spirit did when we talked to him. his body is still dead. and it already was created with abyssal energy, he wasn't poisoned. he *was* the poison.
So we enter the bossfight through... his a##hole
So azdaha is a stand user
That’s big
>We fought his spirit

Where is this stated? His size could simply be downscaled for gameplay purposes.
    In Zhongli's 2nd story quest. Azhdaha's soul was split into 2 parts, the good and the bad. The good went into Kun Jun, and the bad formed into a little girl. That little girl then turned into the Azhdaha that we fought, while the good one fought alongside us, so we only fought half his soul, making him smaller than what he actually is.
    Jiu (which turns into the boss) and Kun Jun were polar opposites of his soul. Neither were the actual physical Azhdaha
Literally the Liyue archon quest was zhongli literally staging his own death to retire because his Nation is so perfect it needs no more god to change it.
    Glorious Liyue, so so much better than the rest of Teyvat.
How they was born when he died ?
    It didn’t happen immediately.  >!There was a big battle inside his body between two factions some time after he died that left shards of shrapnel from exploded robots stabbed all over his insides, the melusines were born from those wounds, they’re basically walking talking scabs/cysts.!<
        Gross
        THATS WHAT THEY ARE?? Why tf are they so cute then? 🤧
Oh
YES
The Salt Goddess’s story was so sad 😭😭😭
    [deleted]
        I did the story AAAAAAGES ago, but I don’t remember Zhongli being the one that killed her?? I thought it was somebody else that did it
            It was her own people
                Ok yeah that’s what I thought! Something like that, not Zhongli
            He basically bullied weaker deity into suicide.
                What game afe you playing? She didn't commit suicide nor was pushed to do it by zhongli
                Mmmmm I don’t recall that
Zhongli: Hello I'd like to work here

Hu tao: And what experience do you have with funerals?

Zhongli: I buried a body in the stone forest

Hu tao: Close enough you're hired
    Surely isn't it "*with* the stone forest"? :p
        Or even "I buried the stone forest in a body"
[Everyone in Liyue](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi2-prod.mirror.co.uk%2Fincoming%2Farticle10496506.ece%2FALTERNATES%2Fs1200b%2FLittle-girl-from-side-eye-meme-all-grown-up.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=83cb1774e9216d6a92488e313e2399afa8506f6604672dbc2b78e0edac1d7ff3&ipo=images) 10 seconds after asking themselves why the assistant at the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor has an OP geo element genius invokaction card when he's just some old guy who doesn't even have a vision.
    Zhongli: There has been a lot of interesting rumors about my origins, but truthfully, I am just a normal consultant working in the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor whom the gods blessed with a very powerful geo vision. (Zhongli has a fake vision that he “uses” whenever he fights).
    He has a (of course fake) vision though.
    > when he's just some old guy who doesn't even have a vision.

He has a fake vision.
He has great expertise in burying previously living things, one could say
Maybe she'll move on. Maybe we'll see her in Fontaine dating a squid or something.
    >!Elynas!< gets revived by the Abyss Order, hooks up with Beisht, and they elope to the Dark Sea together.
        And make a bunch more cute creatures because Elynas liked being a dad
Ningguang: oh boy, here I go dropping another Jade Chamber again!
    Beisht best girl out there creating construction jobs.
The domain in Baizhu's story quest contains blood that had leaked into that cavern/cave/ruins from the Chi and that's what was used to make the poison.

>Xiao: So someone has been concocting demonic poison...  
>  
>Xiao: Too often, fervent desires drive mortals to abandon all regard for their own safety... It is lamentable.  
>  
>Xiao: I now know what you seek. It is true that a god's remains are buried beneath the foundations of Qingce Village.  
>  
>Xiao: A vile monster known as the Chi once wrought havoc over this land, before it was subdued by Rex Lapis...  
>  
>Xiao: The land was finally cleansed of poison when Rex Lapis used statues in his likeness to seal the serpent's remains. Qingce Village was founded sometime after that.  
>  
>Xiao: The seal is still mostly intact. If the Chi is the source, then it must be some of its blood leaking from deep underground.
Never thought I'd see a fellow Sarazanmai enjoyer in the wild
    There are literally dozens of us! Dozens!
Fellow sarazanmai enjoyer! That show was so goood
Unless you're Thanos, because sending Ant Man up there somehow isn't going to kill him.
So aliens aren’t real? :(
Irrelevant. Azhdaha was physically brought to the cavernous realm before the entrance was sealed. I'm assuming you're just trolling now.
    He is physically buried on the valley, hence the tremors happening on the Vishap event and continuing on Zhongli's second quest. it's literally his seal breaking off, and we only fight him after the little girl enters the realm and becomes the Azhdaha we fight. I'm not trolling, the explanation is that we don't enter a cave, instead we enter an adeptus realm that is the seal keeping his body dead
        We're literally said to have entered a cave that has an entrance blocked off by an ancient seal. That's literally the same exact place that azhdaha is described to be sealed at. The size difference could just be argued for be downscaled for gameplay purposes like most large bosses are in this game.

I will admit I forgot about the fact that he literally turns back into the girl after defeat and zhongli calling the girl azhdaha's power incarnate, but it being an "adeptus realm" has nothing to do with it and isn't an explanation, hence why I assumed you were trolling.
            Well, he's buried beneath the valley, nothing stops it being inside a cavern, but well, if we were to fight him physically, he'd end up being prime geovishap+ in lore as well. Also because the crucial detail is that the seal weakening made earthquakes happen in Liyue, and that was yet another lore quest on a limited event.  Either way, he's indeed downscalled for technical limitations, it'd be so great if instead we had another kaiju battle aside from Dvalin.
Records of Jueyun Vol 2 speaks of a Sea God with a fairly empathetic personality who may or may not have been Osial... It would be nice to see that expanded into a playable character.
    I get the impression he’s mad at Morax but they might have been friends prior to the war. It would be funny to see them sat at a table like we had the archons at dinner during lantern rite, just jabbing at each other
        Hu Tao: Zhongli, could you please pass the salt to our guest?

Zhongli: *laughs quietly*

Osial disguised as a human: Be careful not to drop it in the ocean, too.
I don't think he was poisoned.

Dragonspine Spear

So just like Elynas, Durin's entire world was the Abyss before being brought up to the surface. I think it's more like a Simurgh situation where, like Rukkhadevata, Gold fashioned a form for these Abyssal creatures.

    Lol rhinedottire really looking sus now isnt she

She's singlehandedly responsible for the cataclysms of 2 different nations.... that we know of.

\#1 worst mom award
        She seems like a horrible person but her "Children" speak so highly of her: Durin, Elynas, Albedo.
        More than that, she's also indirectly responsible for the whole Mondstadt AQ, since Dvalin was poisoned and corrupted from his wounds from the Durin fight

In fontaine too she released a giant dragon which was most likely cataclysmic, and we still don't know the full extent of her involvement in whatever the fuck happened in Kaen'riah 500years ago. So that's at least three regions so far and maybe more if she was an active part of the Kaen'rian disaster that affected every nation without exception
            Whats the 3rd? I was counting mondstadt and fontaine. I know there were riftwolves in inazuma's cataclysm but their relationship with her vs other abyss monsters seems muddy

And yee elynas's blood leaking into the waters poisoned fontaine, presumably what killed off the oceanids
                > Whats the 3rd? I was counting mondstadt and fontaine. I know there were riftwolves in inazuma's cataclysm but their relationship with her vs other abyss monsters seems muddy

Golden Wolflord is the connection
