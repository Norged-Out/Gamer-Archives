[[Fontaine 4.2 AQ thoughts]]


Finished the whole quest and all I have to personally say is that it was amazing. Peak. The genshin writers COOKED and delivered. The quest starts off strongly, and continues strongly up until the very end and it's enjoyable all throughout. 

I never expected the relation between Focalor and Furina to be like that but looking back at it, it should've been clear that they'd do something like that simply because duality overall seems to be a recurring theme in Genshin. 

I know that some people might not be happy with Furina's conclusion but for me, it was written and executed really well. She truly pulled off an unforgettable performance and masquerade, and is now getting the rest she well deserves. I do wish we saw more of her in the end though, so I guess that'd my only complaint.

Edit: why are there people saying Furina is now hated? I haven't done her story quest yet but I've checked the archon's voicelines about her and if anything, they all admire her. No playable characters in the quest said they hate her either.


I feel even sadder for her now remembering she almost got assassinated for trying to just find some happiness in her lonely life

As if her life didn‚Äôt suck enough the past 500 years, she cried herself to sleep and wouldn‚Äôt eat
    Omg you're right üò≠ Back then the scene was kinda funny to me but act V recontextualizes that scene and now I feel traumatized for Furina. Get the girl a therapist istg. Girl needs a psychological debriefing ASAP
        Would be nice if she had interactions with Nahida one day
            Furina is trapped into her role as an archon, Nahida was trapped because she did not "fit" her role as an archon.

Are there divine beings therapists in Teyvat?
                That's the job of the Traveller. üòÖ
                    They give therapy sessions to intercelstial beings in exchange for only a couple of sentences worth lead on their sibling. What a chad.
                Venti?
                    Venti is a drunkard, like literally drinking his "traumas" away, we don't need baby Furina and Nahida following in his footsteps
            Oohh they would be best friends. Furina would go well as Wanderer's sister.
            Honestly furina is one of the few archons that are not really tied to their nation like nahida and ei so im hoping they give this girl all the screentime
    Man...now that you mentioned it...oof...
    Furina went from girlfailure to girlboss that I want to protect
        From "must correct üò≠üí¢" to "must protect üò§üõ°Ô∏è"
    Bro I'm so mad that we didn't get to comfort her somewhere at the end of the quest, the least she deserves is a hug and I was yelling for it every time the Traveler got anywhere close to her

Hoyo please let me hug the poor little water gremlin ;_;
        Wished the people at the end would at least thank her after the flood and she would kneel down finally feeling relieved and cry everything out.
            That's the thing, no one knows. Only Neuvillete and the Traveler really know what she went through. For the people of Fontaine, Furina just stepped down, not dying because Neuvillete took pity on her.
    The worst part is - she was not crying afterwards because she was scared of being attacked. She was scared she failed her mission to protect her people.
    I just can‚Äôt stop feeling sad for her. Girl was immortal for last 500 years and now she‚Äôs gonna age and die like an ordinary human. The rest of her life will feel like the blink of an eye :(
    Also wish she would have told Neuv that she was targeted, he would have dealt with Arlecchino
    That's what's good with this storyline ultimately, you can do it a second time, and it will sound totally differently
Overall 9.5/10

Great story, great characters, tons of great moments and cutscene

But that bit where Furina is crying and the woman is like "this is such a beautiful display of an Archon power" is really difficult to watch
    That scene was such a gut punch. The fact that Furina essentially had to proactively do nothing for 500 years and couldn‚Äôt open up to anyone about it, anyone would start to crack at that point
        That was some genuine cosmic horror shit.

I hope Furina now moves to Mondstat or Liyue and lives a nice peaceful live.
            Fuck it, give her a permanent residence in the teapot. Make it canon.
                No. She's been trapped long enough. Let her live her life for once
                    Vacation home in the teapot
            I have no mouth, but I must scream
    She is almost break when the one she met after being Archon was 20 generations ago, and her tears of loneliness was praise as ‚Äúbeautiful display of power‚Äù is hard to bear.

 Even when MC inside her mind, they couldn‚Äôt break the her character. Even touching primordial sea would kill her, wouldn‚Äôt stop her from risking her life just to buy more time. Only break down when her role had ended and then neither death sentence or primordial sea could fear her no more. 

Truly willpower could rivals gods.
    Absolutely marvelous. I'm finally glad that Furina's story does her justice in the eyes of the playerbase.

She went through so much. I hope she heals.
        Pre-release there were a lot of people who didn‚Äôt like it after reading the leaks, which I didn‚Äôt understand because I thought this story was great. Glad to see that the majority of people like it.
    That scene is genuinely fucked up.  And I mean that in the best way possible -- while you can disturb players in so many direct, "easy" ways, disturbing players in this more intelligent way like this can be so damn hard.  But it worked, and it's truly unsettling.

Poor, poor Furina.
    That was the best scene in my opinion. The tears while putting on a fake smile was one of the best portrayals of the burden she bears. It took the quest from 10/10 to 13/10
I've only had Furina for 30 minutes but if anything happens to her I'll kill everyone and then myself.
    I am kinda mad the Archon Quest had no interaction with Furina in the end.
        She‚Äôs like a bicycle

 She‚Äôs too tired
            Cyno please
            Cyno, this isn't the right time

*screenshots the joke*
        Well maybe we will get some answers on her character quest
        play characters quest, its really good, different side of her
        This is my criticism towards the archon quest
        The entire thing was major character development for her and it absolutely is in my top 5 character quests. She said enough as it was happening.
        This is my only real gripe with it. It gave great closure on Focalors, but Furina not so much. As far as I understand it everyone in Fontaine still only think she deceived them for her own gain right? Or at least, they don't know the sacrifice she has made
        I think they used her story quest to approach that .
            Sadly her story quest turned into typical genshin quest for the most part with some really good Furina moments. Those moments are good enough to like it but I wish it focused some more on the effects of the AQ on Furina. Here's hoping for a banger 2nd story quest
                I liked the quest, surely its not the neuvillette story quest but i think it fits her current state, now that she is human she lives more normal things and can be more free on her decicions.

But i wonder if she or neuvillette would be recieving a second story for the next weekly boss.
                    I do appreciate exploring her human side but going straight to the story quest after the aq was a huge jump from Furina breaking down and then watching as her nation gets flooded but actually things are fine straight to Furina already breaking her rule about not doing performance arts and being fairly light hearted.

Sure, this could be a testament to her strong will but I just wish her SQ1 expanded more on her moving out, maybe having Traveler apologize for tricking her, and even maybe letting Furina confide in them and letting it all out. It would be p cool for the current sq1 to actually have been her sq2 to signal her growth and ability to move on perhaps.

Still, it was a good sq with a banger song at the end and the whole thing serves to even further show Furina's iron will due to how quickly she got back on her feet after something so traumatizing. I'm just pondering.
    load bad primal water with religious intent
The only thing I did not enjoy was the second phase of the whale. It fealt clunky, maybe because I didn't have any Fontaine chars at the current comp. Maybe a warning was deserved (a chance to swap out teams, and telling us a arkhe gimmick exists), or should have given a trial Neuvilette.

The 182376th act part sent shivers up my spine. Easily my favorite scene.
    Bro, when she cried and went to bed, I was so fuking shocked at that moment, and just praying for her
        That was crazily dark for Genshin. Usually they save the really dark stuff for the world quests, but the fact that a main character went through that tormet is rough.
            I am done with her story quest, and I'm quite happy to see her doing fine as a human being, also the moment she got her vision made me happy too, but now I have this doubt about how she got the vision(maybe she is too ambitious about acting )
                Hydro visions are for people that fill a role they believe in even if its not who they really are. Out a principle or belief its the right thing to do. Its less ambition and more a sense of duty. I wanna say her getting the vision right then was because she made the decision to step up even if its painful to herself.
                    You're right, She also mentioned this in her voice line 'about the vision'.
                I havent played that quest yet and will only be able to tomorrow, can u tell me if her quest is set after or before act 5?
                    It is set after act 5!
    Neuvillette gives you the power of Pneumia at that point in the fight, all you had to do was hit the orb once and it should've shattered. Did it with no Fontaine characters in my party.

For the weekly version you'll need an actual Fontaine character, although the fight is easy without any
        Yeah raiden nahida, Kuki still kill him without much of a issue
    That number is almost equivalent to ~500 years as well. So fkn smart to show the passage of time that way
        i think it wouldve been nice if we got some scenes inbetween, like an act 10~ years in, one 50 years in, etc. show her coming to terms with this shit taking a normal humans lifespan in length
            I think they did that pretty effectively via the subjects she was meeting all being from the same bloodline (talking about how her grandma 20 generations back idolized her)
                yeah i get that, but im more meaning about seeing her reaction to the length of time. we see her reactions to the first week, then jump to 500 years. wouldve been great to see her in her room 10 years later realizing "holy fuck"
                    It just meant that it took 500 years to finally make her breakdown which shows her willpower. She was even smiling while tears flowing from her even making excuses.
    I didn't have one as well, but didn't Neuvilette give us a part of his power to deal with that? Because if i'm not becoming schizo, i'm fairly sure my Faruzan was doing Pneumia reactions... Or was it Ousia? Don't know the difference after 12 weeks lmao.
        Neuv literally skipped most of the fight for us.
        Id rather have him appear as a trial character. It was too hard to make out, with a lot going on screen already.
    i just didnt like how the second phase has no lore at all, no descriptions (afaik) and no characters mentioning it. why the fuck is there a knight inside the whale, in an area that resembles the sustainers cubes?
    >The only thing I did not enjoy was the second phase of the whale

I was so confused when it just. Well ended
    man it says something about the archon quest when the boss fight was the most oddly anticlimactic part of it. Which I'm phrasing as a good thing--there was just so much good juicy stuff in the archon quest that I keep forgetting we fought a whale at some point.
Did anyone else chortle when Childe got yeeted?
    https://i.imgur.com/odGngE8.mp4

clip i got of the scene because of how much it made me laugh. skirk dusting her hands afterwards is so fucking funny
        May you get c6 for any character you wish in a 10 pull. That was beautiful
    I love how he‚Äôs perfectly straight

Man makes for a better arrow than an archer
        new childe bow just dropped
            holy celestia
    It was funny then Skirk just casually starts dusting her hands off like that was the most simple task ever which added to it perfectly

Like woman please Childe has been fighting that whale for days on end and we still struggled vs it with a full power Neuvillette you could at least treat Childe with some semblance of care, truly a ruthless teacher I love it lmao

Then again same JP VA as Scathach so not surprised she treats her disciples like that lol
        Reminder that Childe's goal was to get his master to fight him using both hands finally. The fact that Skirk yeeted him with just one hand still is kind of brutal
        Childe was having the time of his life fighting that giant Narwhal, his whole thing is fighting strong opponents and he got the chance to square the fuck up to an ancient cosmic all devouring entity, Skirk is just gently tossing her disciple into bed to rest, she's so nice to him.
            Gently huh
    Me! It was even funny when Skirk trashtalked him lmao
        Was it really trash talking him though? She said she doesnt talk to weak people which is why she didnt sat much to childe sure, but that was reffering to him when he was a a kid/teen.
        he wasnt worth her trashtalking to kekl
    Yeet the Childe.
        I‚Äôm calling the Childe Protection Service!
    And dusting her hand after that.
Probably the best story content to come out of genshin thus far. Focalors is literally hydro jesus, dying for man's sins.

Also she walks on water but that's just icing on the cake.

The biblical similarities don't stop there with Writh's Ark boat saving people
The lore drop of Gnosis being remnants of the 3rd descender is pretty big.

It opens up a big can of worms. What else foreign has been brought to Teyvat and integrated into it? The concept of elemental powers? The concept of visions? 

We already know the Heavenly Principles is the first descender and rule Teyvat with an iron fist. Could they be the one that moulded the world as they see fit? Their ability to integrate foreign elements into the world and make it concrete could very well be an explanation as to why the sibling is not a descender like the traveler: Because they have already been integrated into the world thanks to the Heavenly Principles. 

Skirk's master saying that the Gnosis is a magnet for trouble could also mean that the will of the planet is rebeling against forced integration of foreign elements, like a body rejecting implanted organs.
    >We already know the Heavenly Principles is the first descender

I missed some stuff or can't remember this. can you explain? There's way too much to this Genshin lore stuff.
        It's not confirmed, but nahida assumes it 

[skip to 2:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_DAoV-NWU)
            Also the Abyss is the Second Who Came, which would have to make Celestia the first.
                The abyssal realm has always existed in Teyvat.

The dragons were the light realm and the abyss was the void realm.
            I'm going to have to revisit that conversation
        Wouldn't the primordial one aka the first who came be the first descender? Unless Heavenly principle and primordial one is same person.
    Also would suggest that the Traveler is indeed like a magnet for trouble, just like Paimon mentioned at the very start of the Fontaine Archon Quests before we left Sumeru. XD
Amazes me that focalor's plan could have gone very wrongly if neuvillete hadn't felt empathy the past 500 years. He could be like "Aight I got my powers back, I'm outta here" and left the people of fontaine to dissolve.
    also if a 2nd Archon War had occurred or anyone tried to invade Fontaine, she would have been powerless and the ruse would have been completely blown
        I'm guessing that Focalors was counting on Celestia to prevent or intervene in the case of all-out war between the nations. That or how technically advanced Fontaine is in comparison to other nations aside from Snehznya, would've scared off other countries that didn't know Furina was quite powerless
            current day Fontaine is indeed quite strong but in the early days (100 years into the 500 year plan for example) we don't know how powerful Fontaine was. A rogue evil god like Osial or his wife could have tried to conquer Fontaine (just using an example) and well...
                True, also I can't imagine how stressed the fuck out Furina would be if an Osial showed up lmao, she'd go insane
    She didn't have much choice. If she didn't do what she did the prophecy would've killed every Fontainian regardless and she would still be left alone on the throne crying.

I don't think she started the plan with full confidence it would work 100%, and compared with Neuv not feeling empathy, Furina's human mind breaking midway is a much more likely reason for failure.
After seeing everything Furina went through I couldn't see any other conclusion that would let her slowly heal than the one we got. She has to recover from playing the role of Focalor, thankfully Hoyo's not done with her character, I look forward to seeing her grow in the future. Best Archon for me but then again they all have their charms.
    Before: Furina is an irresponsible god who may or may not have done anything while her nation is on the brink of doom



After: Furina hasn't done anything wrong. She's played her part spectacularly and to the best of her abilities. She has truly done her best and really tried her best. She deserves all the headpats, hugs and sweets in the world. She deserves to rest, enjoy life and know how much of a good girl she's been.
        Yeah I really love how it recontextualizes everything, at first you think she‚Äôs just a funny girlfailure but then you realize she might just be the most dedicated Archon yet.
        And The fcking traveler and Paimon taking audacity to comfort her in story quest after Aether destroyed and humiliated her in Archon quest
            Tbf The Traveler was only doing what he thought was right at the time. He never would‚Äôve humiliated Furina if he knew the full story. Given the facts he had, it‚Äôs a reasonable conclusion that he wanted to stop a poser from giving people false hope
            This is so true, they don't deserve to do that, what they needed is to apologize sincerely since it's what Furina deserved. The nerve lmao
            Yes. Seriously noted that for complain
    The fact that this quest and monstadt's quest are in the same game is crazy. The quality has really skyrocketed since sumeru imo.
        I imagine that Inazuma could have been on the quality of those two if it wasn‚Äôt rushed.

The whole Furina/Focalors plot felt like a more fleshed out version of Raiden/Ei.
            The whole Watatsumi island and Raiden's dimension should've been 2 different acts.
            Inazuma actually had great themes and ideas, but it was paced really badly, probably due to COVID development or something.
                Yes. Inazuma makes me so mad because there was so much potential there. It had the chance to be something amazing.
            Even Neuvillete's thoughts about his belonging in this world where quite similar to the ones Ganyu has, but the execution and depth to them is miles away. Their storytelling has improve SO MUCH.
            This is so real, Inazuma was awesome to me as a regi√≥n but if only its story couldve been delivered as well as sumerus or fontaines It wouldve been the second BEST (cuz It wouldnt top fontaine for me tbh)
        This is prob why Venti hasn't had his chara story.
    >Best Archon for me 

In general terms, I still think Nahida is the best one and quite hard to top, but, as someone that really don't like Furina's personality, she played her role AMAZINGLY, I'm still quite not being a fan of her but the development and passing in the story was quite interesting and they allow us to know what's behind her, not to now say "look, she is great now, no more failure" but to understand whats going on and tell us the story of Fontaine.

Her interactions with Neuvillete have been the best ones and have no comparison with the rest of the regions. For me, Neuvillete is the best writed character in the game right now, having a playable primordial dragon was the best decision ever, that allow us to have a more responsable approach to things but also carry on with Focalors plan and Furina's show.

Also... Love that everything wasn't center on her, but in a profecy that affects all the region, allowing us to know more about it, to care about the region, they used their cast as NEVER before, but also, bring back Childe to develop him even more, the appearence of Mona, short but pretty useful and a nice touch.

Quite impressive in general, maybe not the best archon for me, but definetly this region has the best story arc until now and make me enjoy the game again so much, never has been so excited since I went into Beidou's ship to go to Inazuma.

"The original wish of oceanids to get together with their beloved humans"

The Poem mini event in 4.1 makes so much more sense now
10/10

Cried for the first time in Genshin during the Focalor sacrifice / Neuvilette removing the sin from Fontaine cutscene. Also they managed to turn Furina into one of my favourite characters when I was previously just annoyed by her. Phenomenal resolution to the AQ overall.

Am very excited for future AQs due to both the quality of this one and all the lore questions brought up by Skirk's comments.
    her character quest is so wholesome, feel fresh see different side of her
    The silent sacrifice she made and kept for so long was really powerful to see. Even at her greatest moment of weakness and vulnerability, she did not relent. Mad props to her
Genuinely blown away, what a fantastic conclusion to the AQ

I have to say the lore drops towards the end, especially in regards to the gnosis leave me intrigued. Every time we get an answer we just have more questions raised. Its great

Focalors and Furina living up to the duality theme perfectly, absolutely loved their entire story and developments. Navia and Childe probably had my favorite contributions though, their involvements were great highlights. Arlecchino at the end just absolutely doing a fantastic job of balancing friend/foe. What a great character even with her limited involvement. Also Skirk even with her limited involvement left a great first impression, love her already

Loved all of this, arguably my favorite AQ to date. It was long but I never felt tired, I was invested the whole way through. 

Edit: Oh and shout out to Melus and Silver, their devotion to Navia cannot be understated. Their contributions shall never be forgotten, got me as teary eyed as Navia
    Honestly Melus and Silver are Teppei done right. My heart sunk when we met Navia and they weren't around, and I got teary eyed and almost cried at the grave scene. I loved them in all their appearances and seeing them leave hurts so much.
        Teppei crawled so Dunyarzad could run and live and so Melus and Silver could be an NPC sacrifice done well. Honestly even after being dissolved they still were devoted to keeping her alive, it got me good best subordinates
        Melus literally sounded like my grandpa when he would read stories out loud to me in a "David Attenborough" voice and it made me SOB
    Yeah I love that it gave more information on Gnoses and descenders at the end much like the end of Sumeru's!

I must say tho, the narwhal seemed too out of place for me. Like it doesn't belong in the same story. An intergalactic space monster being the cause of the primordial sea water rising feels out of place to me in terms of the story so far. Like it's fine for me if the seawater rising is because of the prophecy just happening without having a specific cause. But the specific cause they gave just took me out of it. Space whale is too out there for me personally especially since I expected the prophecy to be all Celestia/Heavenly Principles. Skirk also came out of nowhere, literally. Anyhow, it was still an visually appealing weekly boss and Skirk gave a few lore crumbs so I guess I'm fine with it.
        my only issue is that the whale is a pet. not only does that mean we have some absurd powerscaling of someone taming it, but the entire doomsday prophecy being due to the whims of some strong dude wanting to feed his space whale is odd
            That's been there since the beginning. Skirk likened her master to the alchemist Gold, and Gold was responsible for the cataclysm where multiple archons died
                genuinely fair point, i guess it just feels different reading about ancient lore of a powerful alchemist, versus skirk nonchalantly being like "lol yeah he was feeding his pet whale"
        Genshin Impact is a part of larger universe so that didn't bother me much. It's a reminder that there are far more dangerous things lurking outside of Teyvat.
            I mean I know that. Traveler is basically like an amnesic space hero. It's just that in the context of the whole Fontaine arc which is more focused on solving mysteries in prisons, the opera, and the city, trying to save people from a prophesied flood, the sudden appearance of an intergalactic space monster seems out of place. Not to mention that Fontaine is mecha/steampunk-esque in design and atmosphere so I didn't expect the interdimensional narwhal tbh. They did tease the whale last patch so maybe it's just me ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Still love Act V as a whole tho üíú
                I thought it fits the whole fate theme, child Childe being the accidental trigger but later also being necessary to hold the whale off for a few weeks to finish the prophecy with the trial. And all the pieces that needed to perfectly fit for Focalor plans to work out. It also adds a whole layer of more mystery to Albedos master (she has too many names), it certainly takes powers out of this world to do what she supposedly did. If you think about it, a lot of the most impactful influence in Teyvat came from outside - the descenders being in the centre of everything. Anyways, sorry for the tangent. In my mind the space whale fits right in.
        i just realized feels like the primodordial whale is the equivalent of neuvilette as a leviathan/whale in draconic form. so maybe it's like primordial whale vs dragon whale
    And many Players had Questions why Melus and silver weren't included in the recent Furina Trailer.... Now we have the answer...I am still sad
    >especially in regards to the gnosis leave me intrigued

Every time another Gnosis ends up in the hands of the Fatui, I groan. At least Neuvillette gave a good reasoning for willingly handing over the Gnosis but man- Tevat is mega-fucked if the Fatui get all seven Gnoses, and I don't even know what their master plan is! But knowing what they did with the electro Gnosis and having it give that amount of power to Scaramouche, I bet it's gonna be some epic archon-topping, reality-shattering, completely broken in every way god-related super device of some sort.
        If I had to guess, maybe they plan to ressurect the third descender and return power to the dragons in order to overthrow Celestia?
            Oh. My. God. 

The resurrecting the third descender part is possible and would be amazing.
                That would be so cool. Collect all the pieces and the third descender lives again
            Third Descender, aka Exodia
            How about waiting for the 4th descender to collect all 7 elements and then kill it. Having ang Omni element Gnosis is crack. Hahah
            im sure others have mentioned it before but act 5 is called "Incandescent Ode of Resurrection" maybe not the dragon stuff because that seems harder but the first part kinda checks out because they would have all the gnosis at the end of the next act right.
        Arlecchino basically all but confirming that Fatui plans revolve around the world as a whole. Can only wonder how the Gnosis all come into play, especially as Skirk describing them as misfortune

The fact the lore drops that they are remains of the third descender in on itself is such a big revelation. Can only wonder what the Fatui plan on doing with them and whether it will work considering they apparently bring misfortune
            I mean, hard to say how exactly they will be used, but presumably they're planning to use their power in some way to overthrow Celestia.
            Yeah , now with many AQs until today, now I think about It, that the fatui and harbingers May Not be that evil after all ( with some exceptions) 
But the abyss Organization is still kinda evil
            >as misfortune

Given the context of their little chat, it felt a bit like a threat to me. Like "Oh you have so much money in your hand, would really be a pity if I had to kill you to get it."
        they already have six of the seven gnosis (one stolen, four peacefully exchanged, and one from the tsaritsa herself). the last one is in natlan, which just so happens to be in the nation of *war*. i foresee a huge war coming fighting over the last gnosis (just like how in infinity war the last infinity stone was obtained after a huge battle)
        I had the same exact reaction. BUT, I thought about it and realized the fatui are probably on the same side as the traveler, getting back at/killing the heavenly principles. Pretty sure they are either going to use the gnoses power or resurrect the 3rd descender.
        Why are you so sure that Teyvat is fucked if they get all the gnoses? To me it seems like the Tsaritsa‚Äôs plan is to go to war with the Heavenly Principles, which means we could be on the same side after all.
        It was the most successful Fatui operation to date. They saved lives in  Fontaine. They established good relations with court of Fontaine and Spina de Rosula. And they got a gnosis of the hydro archon in a trade/reward for their efforts. Unlike the rest of the nations they‚Äôre not persona non grata with Fontaine for now.
        Don't say what "they" did to Electro Gnosis. It was only Dottore
Bro it released like 5 hours ago how are people so fast üò≠
    Gotta bum rush it to avoid Youtubers puting fkn spoilers in their video titles. This is the only way. 

Worth it.
        This. I stayed up to finish it so I wouldn't be spoiled. Absolutely worth it.
            Same. Had to stay home from school cause I was too tired to drive in the morning. It feels irresponsible to say, but it was absolutely worth it. But fuck it, it's like missing a day of school to see a midnight release Endgame or the final Harry Potter or something.
            Yeah I went to bed at 1 am on a work night just so I could finish it. Worth it
            Agreed. No regrets at all.
        Literally yes. The spoilers run rampant everywhere
            6am rn I haven't had a wink of sleep, I am so glad I held off on spoilers to witness this quest. Peak writing
                Same haven't finish the archon and character quest until 6 am. Had no sleep. Worth it.
        Oh god if this isn't me but with fear of reddit spoilers. I just got on reddit after finishing the very long AQ (I think I was playing for 4 hrs straight üíÄ) but it was worth it! Will do the story quest tomorrow so y'all can't spoil me anymore üòÇ
        Use youtube block extension.
        This. Is imposible just to see youtube, tik tok, twitter, etc
    It's about five hours long without skipping any dialogue at all
I clocked in at about four and a half
    I was awake an hour before maintenance finished and I've been waiting for this update for so long lol üò≠
    It released at 3pm for me, easily the first thing imma do as ive been looking forward to it since 4.1 AQ ended
    Some madman completed the AQ in an hour and released cutscenes on Youtube.

Guess it‚Äôs all about the views.
    It‚Äôs relatively short. Only 1 act. Took about 3-4 hrs.
        Wym relatively short? It was roughly 4 hours. Fitting for an act v
            I meant compared to previous patches where we had 2 acts. Hence the reason why I said ‚Äúonly 1 act.‚Äù
                Valid I guess. It took me roughly the same about of time to finish this one act vs the two in the last patch so I based my judgement off that
    I called it sick for this.
    Ikr i got on once update came and i got distracted exploring that i forgot to do aq.
    I stayed up past 2am and STILL didn't finish it. I knew I didn't have time to play it today and now I'm suffering with sleep deprivation.
Really great overall but the flood is really tripping me up like, what happened to the rest of Teyvat when it all went down?
    Presumably invisible walls on the border
        "How about we explore the area ahead of us later?"
        ‚ÄúSuck to be them‚Äù
    It‚Äôs probably just Fontiane sinking instead of the water levels rising.
    "What happens in Teyvat stays in Teyvat" - The Heavenly Principles ^(probably)
    Probably a localized Event
    Disappeared among the sea ~~of butterflies~~
        ILLUSIONS OF THE ASS
    Have you forgotten the steep desert cliffs you have to climb/jump down to reach Fountaine? And its easy to forget the nation is literally bordered by waterfalls.

Basically, the nation's topography keeps such a flood more localized then you think.
        Yea but the whole nation is higher than whole region of Mondstad, I haven't seen how the land between those 2 nation's looks from new region, but even then, water from Fontaine flows all the way to liyue, which means everything there would be flooded too. Also the water level was high enough to sink the city of Fontaine and I think it rose higher than dragonspine peak, it had to be magically contained somehow
    The guilty verdict was on Fontaine alone, idk why it's surprising the flood didn't affect other nations
    Skirk mentioned how the flood is from the excess hydro energy. I imagine the flood comes from Fountaine within and goes outwards. So basically the water erupted like boiling water and then spills outwards and drains in like Sumeru or something.

That would explain how it receded so fast.
I just finished it and enjoyed it a lot.
I would say it‚Äôs on-par, if not, more enjoyable than Sumeru for me.. I cried at least three times throughout the entirety of Act V and the pacing, storytelling, and english voice acting for Fontaine is amazing. üò≠üíï

My only complaint is the fact that we don‚Äôt get to talk to Furina to see if she‚Äôs OK at the end. But it‚Äôs understandable, she needs time for herself after such a traumatizing event.. üòû How much are the rates for therapist in Teyvat anyway? üíîüíî
    We get her personal character quest in any case c:
    It was the first time I actually ugly cried instead of only shedding some tears lol
        I just did Furina‚Äôs Story Quest and ugly cried, AGAIN. THIS IS THE FOURTH TIME FOR THE DAY.. üò≠üò≠
            SOBBING WEEPING RN
I loved it so much. This is my favorite AQ as of date! I wish they put a bit more show about Wriothesley's ship because I really loved his ship and him in general but oh well I guess he already had most of 4.1 AQ anyway
It was amazing. Also... hoyo really loves to make neuvillette suffer.....>!his voice when he got his powers back!<....mannn üò≠üò≠
    Have to admit that I lost it when >!Focalors recites the "Hydro Dragon, Hydro Dragon, Don't Cry" line.  It really hits home for everyone who already played his character quest.  Right before she said it, I said it myself imagining it'd be the perfect line there, and sure enough.  Absolutely brilliant way to bring that back.!<
        I sort figured the line would show up in their conversation, but it still got me in the feels when she said it
        And then Furina also say that line to him in the future event.
    Him and Furina. No wonder they're Hydro. Also don't forget Egeria, her corpse is still being used to cleanse the Abyss, I hope we have a focus on her a bit more in the future. >!I feel creeped out by what's happening to the gods recently, it's body horror  when you imagine what happened to the third Descender and it's kinda hinting at what their plans with Traveler!< Only Elynas seems to have the best experience dying, it gets to have cute Melusines born from it and he absolutely loves them, his body is just turned to stone too and he could hypothetically revive.
        Third descender could be your real sibling.
            Honestly I thought that too like maybe they counted it as our sibling getting into Teyvat first and then us which is 2 simultaneous Descenders at the same time but then I remembered, we came there just 500 years ago, the Archon wars, especially the fight between the Dragons, 1st and 2nd descender happened for who knows how long ago that it's inconceivable for our twin to be dismembered for it because the Archons already existed 2000+ years ago when the original Seven were seated, unless the Heavenly Principle did some wonky timeline shenanigans where she sent our sibling to the past to be put on the chopping block and then us in the future as some sort of spare or whatever (Paimon being sent as a tracker and sticking her to us) and then it becomes some sort of loop, I dunno
            I thought our sibling belonged to this world so they couldn‚Äôt be the descender? Am I wrong?
                You're thinking of the Abyss Sibling. They are a part of this world, and because of that, they can't be our real sibling, but likely a clone with the same memories.
    My first thought was>! ‚ÄúOh *boy* he sounds pissed at the Heavenly Principles for what they caused Focalors/Furina to have to do‚Äù!<
        Every time the story progresses, we see more and more "skeletons in Celestia's closet"
        >!I mean Focalor indirectly told him to judge them for her. I'm sure he's thinking him judging them is the justice both Furina and Focalor deserve.!<
            Finishing the AQ also >!unlocks the "about the Archons" voice lines where he also confirms this. Every one of them is about judging them and their authority as God's. He does feel bad for Buer being neglected though, a nice note!<
Genshin story writers definitely need a raise for this conclusion. The twist, the drama, the spices of Fontaine was beyond epic! 

For me Furina‚Äôs done enough for the plot, she is the literal embodiment of ‚Äòfake it til you make it‚Äô git gud‚Ä¶ that poor girl deserves her rest. I love how the writers put her off the spotlight after 500 years being on the spotlight. Truly well done.
    Fontaine was such a breath of fresh air. I loved seeing the usual Genshin fantasy elements but in a more ‚Äòmodern‚Äô society.
Loved the majority of the quest, very reminiscent of Master Detective Archives: Rain Code.

Did not appreciate how Childe‚Äôs arc was handled, at all. We didn‚Äôt get any answers as to why his vision was acting up or what was going on with him while he was missing. Plus nobody really gave a shit when mans passed out after saving everyone and fighting this otherworldly beast for months. Alone.

His showdown with the Narwhal is such an integral part of his lore, he has voice lines about wanting to behead that beast that he first met in the Abyss. His constellation is literally a Narwhal. So many things. It would make more sense for there to be more screentime for something that important. We need his POV of the whole quest.

Also, there was no explanation about the Humanoid boss we fight with in the middle of the Narwhal battle? Was that Childe? The boss has too many similarities to FL.
    I really agree with your points! The quest was good but I think there are too many questions around what happend to Childe for me to be satisfied.
        Exactly. I hope we get some kind of follow-up
    It was also pretty clear with Shirk that hoyo will push Genshin to a multiverse thing (At least in my opinion). I don't trust Hoyo for those things, people praise Honkai but it's a story mess in my personal opinion. The fact that they handled Childe, Shirk and the whale so bad here kinda enforces my fears for the future. Also, I had a feeling over all the story quest that the gnosis should have been destroyed. In the end, we just got a really fast conclusion about Childe, Shirk and others. Also, I enjoyed Forcalors story but I cannot stop thinking that was also cheap in the conception. Way to many similarities with Raiden/Ei, Nahida/Rukkhadevata, but the way that they handled it was way better. Hope that they don't pull that card again in Natlan and focus more in the dragons (The land of war and dragons in the words of Neuvilette)
I think it was like, 9.5/10 AT LEAST. I really, really enjoyed it. The time just flew by and as I am writing this, it is 5 to 1am where I am. I was totally engrossed in it all.

&#x200B;

But I need to comment on the fact that the All-Devouring Narwhal boss music has freaking full-on DUBSTEP in it. Like I was impressed when I heard some elements of it in the Scaramouche boss fight, but the shadow phase- nah. Just straight dubstep. I know it's cheesy and I know it's not everyone's cup of tea, but that REALLY pushed that fight for me.
    Entering the second immediately with that music and the whale scream/sound was awesome, I fully agree. But also the first phase's orchestra is just absolutely insane
        I second that. Genshin's score/soundtrack is quickly rivalling that of the Halo series- at least in my heart.
    Dude I thought the exact same, the narwhal music absolutely slapssss, need to wait for someone on YouTube to release a loop to study to üòÇ
        I'm sure people are going to make gamerips of it. I might do the same, actually.
    i like how when the narwhal attacks the court in the cutscene, it plays a remix of tartaglias boss theme
        And when Childe shows up, his version of the harbinger theme completely takes over the track.
    I think anything abyss related has different feel of the music. Like Before the Light Fades for Marana's Avatar
        I haven't gotten THAT far in the Aranara world quest. I'm still quite far from what I perceive to be the end of it.
            I see. The Withering music in Sumeru is some of my favourites musics in the game
                The Withering theme is pretty darn good.
        Before the Light Fades is such a great track, I love how it‚Äôs almost completely antithetical to the rest of Sumeru‚Äôs sound track, really gives the feeling that this is something foreign and hostile
It was so fucking good. Honestly just made me love Furina so much more.
    I wouldnt *trust anyone* who didn't love Furina more after that Act
Genshin made me cry for the first time in all these 3 years, what a fucking quest!
    I‚Äôm usually a big crier and this game hasn‚Äôt gotten anything out of me at all‚Ä¶ until Focalor told Neuvilette not to cry. Pretty much lost it in that scene. Huge, amazing, spectacular kudos to the voice actors who absolutely sold that moment!
        I lost it the moment Furina involuntarily started shedding tears during her talk the the woman. It's such a relatable and hard-hitting scene for 'putting a brave face' type of people.
            ‚ÄúSuch display of Archon power‚Äù
Melus and Silver got my respect they are the reason why Navia is playable
my goodness i havent finished it but i spoiled myself earlier, BUT HOLY COW i got chills with the story
I think sumeru AQ was a peak genshin story but once again mihoyo prove me wrong.. the theathrical PoV between focalor and furina really superb. Especially focalor last dance its beautifullll. The beautiful dance before death ever
I'm just absolutely floored by it. I did not expect that Focalors would straight up break the Seven like that. I'm so happy that in all the things that were a little bit spoiled for me (Childe main, also religiously checked the leak sub to give someone else irl updates on banner leaks and some stuff fell through the cracks there), this small but important detail wasn't one of them.

You can't have the prophecy come true if the Hydro Archon as a concept no longer exists. And the Neuvillette cutscene? Her dancing underneath the blade of indemnitium? Furina's life as a play? Childe getting tossed by Skirk? THE GNOSES BEING REMAINS OF THE THIRD DESCENDER? Ugh...this quest gave me a lot to think about. More than what Sumeru did, in my opinion, and Sumeru was mind boggling too.

They came, they cooked, they delivered.
    No. Actually prophecy actually come true, as Furina weeping alone on her throne while everything around sink. 

 What Focalos did is killed herself and the Throne, give power back to Neu, and he use power to turn people into real human, thus primordial sea affect them no more.
    Does this mean we should start calling them "The Six" now!?! 

Also, if the Heavenly Principles *might* have woken up from what Nahida threatened to do (destroy a gnosis)... SURELY THEY'RE AWAKE NOW FROM THE DESTRUCTION OF A THRONE OF THE SEVEN AND A RESTORATION OF A SOVEREIGN'S AUTHORITY?!?!?

God this quest was amazing
        How will Hoyo insert the Celestia waking up between Natlan and Snezhnaya, something I‚Äôm excited about
    So glad they followed through with the death, and they did so in such a spectacular way. It raised the stakes of the story as a whole and was so satisfying. Gotta go watch that cutscene again ...
I enjoyed this Archon quest a great deal, second best after Sumeru IMO. I do wish there were some more interactions shown between Furina and Neuvillette after the story ends. I feel like it's a missed opportunity when she could have finally been honest with him and confided in him.
The only thing that disappointed me was the traveler not getting a cutscene fighting the whale as a way to show his original strength actually slowly returning + element utilization. FFS Mihoyo him being able to use multiple elements and insanely good at fighting is his main specialty, at least show it in the story

Also, I didn't expect Mihoyo to actually give Focalors a different outfit considering they just made Rukkhadevata a shiny version of Nahida.

Furina begging for everyone to believe her in the courtroom was something, that made me actually feel bad and her starting out as an archon sounding all polite was fucking cute. Truly best girl
    >a way to show his original strength actually slowly returning

I don't think that's happening though. Skirk mentions the narwhal was defeated without any strength from beyond the planet, indicating the Traveler still doesn't have any of their original power and only relies on Teyvat's elemental powers.
        Nah she means they defeated without relying on the abyss powers, because she uses it
    Yeah, I wish that they give Traveller more awesome moments of using their powers
    So true. This is what really pisses me off about the devs. They can make all these quests that show off the capabilities of the playable characters but they can't even show the Traveler utilizing all of the elements they have? Like they did it once during Childe's fight and that's it. Fuck off, man. Who's really the protagonist here?
Furina needs therapy
It was good but some of the  Neuvillette haters probably despised it. 
Anyways Furina deserves the world.
    We probably still gonna be seeing a lot of people that still being denial, can't accept the fact that Neuvillette literally the strongest playable character we have.
        Not even about strength, but acting like he‚Äôs the source of all of Furina‚Äôs misery and he‚Äôs the reason she wound up getting depressed, when it‚Äôs painfully obvious he still cares for her. He just sucks at expressing himself.
I swear to God a lot of the people here just skipped through all the dialogue only to draw conclusions without having read a damn thing lol

I thought it was excellent.  A nice twist to the archon quests and a character I'll be thinking about for a while
    A lot of people are simply obsessed with the Hydro Archon title more than Furina herself, and drew all their conclusions from leaks so here they are now lol
        It was a good ending for her. That expression she showed at the cutscene after the flood tells everything. That was a look of relief, freedom. That summarizes her good ending although we do not see her directly interacting with others.
        This is fucking true. She fucking hated being an archon god damit let her fucking rest
So... If I get it correctly

Focalors pulled a || Jesus? Made herself in human form to go through the prophecy while keeping the divinity afar and watched everything take place as a interactive witness? ||
    Jesus isnt the best example since Furina was fully human and had no special powers. Focalors didn't do nothing, she resided in the Oratrice and gathered indemnitium for her eventual execution, while kept an eye on Fontaine through the Oratrice. She did purposely gave Childe a guilty sentence in order to get him to the Narwhal faster in order to keep it at bay at much as possible.
LOL.....the same people complaining about the supposed terrible treatment of Furina and the story being PG and bland.....can't even handle the slightest of trauma or real implications for characters is too ironic.

The story needs tragedy and trauma, and not just for NPC or world quest characters but main characters to enrich the fabric of the world and overall story. Not every character will have happy endings or get what you as a fan of the character think they deserve.

The character's fates should be a portion of the overall world lore, story progression, tone and themes of a good literary work. Not everything will work out in the end and there will be bitterness, but that does not mean it is bad just because your favourite character didn't fulfill a fantasy ending.

People need to realize there will be 7 Archons, not all 7 should follow the same formula or get "good" or "deserved" wholesome/happy endings, that would be boring and too formulaic. Each Archon should have their own unique challenges and journey to face, hence the multiple character quests. 

Those people thinking Furina will be irrelevant are just delusional, because there will be character quest chapter 2, chapter 3 etc. to continue Furina's individual journey and all the major players in each region will get folded into future Archon Quests.
    Well, can we even officially call Furina a playable archon? Isn't Neuvilette more archon at this point, than her?

Kinda weird for people building full archon teams. Haha
        She is the recognized Archon, Neiuvilette technically is a Sovereign. Additionally, Archon is simply a title that can be given and taken away, people should not be too hyper focused on that point, personal opinion.

What this quest more so asks the player is what does it truly mean to be an Archon, what defines an Archon? Is it the all power and might, is it the love for the people and nation, is the the support of all their subjects, is it doing what is necessary to protect what is important to them, is it the shoulder the burden and duties of the people and nation etc.

Personally feel this quest is more about the deconstruction of the idea of the so called traditional Archon and stressing the humanity of gods or rather the divinity of humans. Even though Furina does not fit the ideal criteria of the traditional Archon title, she still did what an Archon must for the nation and people, personal opinion.

That goes back to the point of not all stories need to follow the same pattern or arrive at the same conclusion, variety is key especially considering a long running story and ensemble cast (7 Archons, 7 Stories) so certain characters facing different circumstances and challenges are necessary, all characters do not need to have fantasy good endings, sprinkling of misfortune and tragedy is a vital part of good stories.
            If zhongli can retire from being a archon but the community is still calling him one then I don't see why we can't do the same with furina.
                Because he is recognized as an Archon in authority, and we now know from Neuvillette's voice lines that Zhongli still, like all Archons (unconsciously) hands out Visions

&#x200B;

Now, handing out Visions is Neuvillette's job, not Furina's, she has no authority over Hydro

so yeah I wouldn't consider her in the same bracket as Nahida, Raiden, Venti or Zhongli
                    >!He's not an Archon. The throne of the hydro archon has been destroyed by Focalor, no one will ever inherit the title of "hydro Archon" ever again. Neuvillette is the hydro sovereign. If you consider him as archon then you should also recognize Apep.!<
                    Where is it stated that zhongli still hands out the visions? He doesn‚Äôt even have the gnosis anymore. Id like to know the exact quote
                        Neuvillette Vision story, it explicitly says he hands out Visions now. If the other archons didn't hand them out anymore, it would have been mentioned.

&#x200B;

Even when Raiden didn't have her Gnosis for 500yrs since she gave it to Yae, people (like Fischl) still got electro visions, so logically them not having a Gnosis doesn't matter since the Archons have Authority over elements, and Furina gave her Authority to Neuvillette so he now hands out Visions despite being a Dragon Sovereign and not an Archon. No other Archon handed over Authority, so despite their lack of gnosis, they still give out visions and are archons to me, unlike Furina.

&#x200B;

Neuvillette Vision Story:

&#x200B;

"From that day on, whenever a person's wishes reached the heavens, the seven overseers of the material realm were duty-bound to grant them a gift. Though they might know nothing of who or what wish had stepped into the threshold of the sacred, the Seven Archons still had to impart a shattered shard of their mastery to that person. And when one so gifted completed their duty... the gift the gods would receiving in return would be more abundant still."

"Neuvillette obeys no edict from the heavens, but he does acknowledge human will. So he too set aside parts of himself, as like unto the dragon-treasure hoards of old, awaiting valiant humans to come and claim them."
                            Seems like such an arbitrary metric to judge who the archon is. Moreover, I think you're latching on too much to inference considering we know that the raiden shogun didn't know she was handing out visions either. Whose to say zhongli/venti/raiden/nahida are still doing it? Certainly not that passage, no?

It's just you inferencing that they do it, we don't know that they still do without the gnoses. Furina is one part of focalors, the hydro archon. The game will treat her as the archon for all intents and purposes.

Then I guess, to you, the archon is just no one? because according to that exact same quote you gave it cannot be neuvilette. He doesn't obey the edict from the heavens and does it off his own will.
                    they put Furina in the anniversary art this year with the rest of the Archons, maybe just to avoid spoilers but we'll get a real answer next year when they release the next anniversary art if we see Furina or Neuvilette.
            Besides Zhongli himself said that the age of the gods is coming to an end. I think this aq solidified that. As Dainslief said "humans have their humanity" and it was Furina's humanity that saved Fontaine.
                Truly Cooking!!! The point of Archon quests is not to follow some formulaic pattern for each archon but progress the overall world and story progression. This archon quest progressed the weakening of archons powers, hence the end of the age of gods, and the Dain statement as mentioned above.

Also this is setting up to allow room for a new party of players, the Sovereigns to make an impact and entrance later (Natlan) and stir the story further with how Celestia, Sovereigns, Descenders, Archons, Travelers, Fatui and many some other currently unknown characters from beyond etc will connect and interact.
        I suspect Teyvat is pretty rapidly racing towards the abolition of the Archons, anyway. They're Celestia's minions and at this point, it's pretty obvious the Fatui are probably looking to aim their gnoses death laser (or whatever they have planned) upwards. Also, the other Archons didn't seem all that attached to their gnoses, either. Half of them don't act in their positions as gods anymore, either. So what makes them Archons, really?

And considering what Celestia has done to the dragons, I think Neuvillette would be insulted to be called an Archon. He's more like the Liyue Qixing, plus his added responsibility of being a living battery because Fontaine is in the steampunk era.
        If you want to get technical Ei was never actually an archon either
            well, if we go by the theory that every nation has a kind of "throne" for an archon to sit on, Ei would be the successor to Makoto in filling the role.
        Well, I mean Hoyo never promised anyone anything about a supposedly all archon team so... 

Besides, if they wanted, there are already 4 archon archons that can form a team lol
        If you were to call Neuvilette an Archon to his face he might just smash your head off lol.
When I first started playing, there were three story beats that I wanted to see: a character earning a vision, the birth of an archon, and the death of an archon. We got the first two in Sumeru (birth being more in spirit than literal), and we finally got the third in this AQ. Needless to say I'm more than satisfied on how each was portrayed and have no idea about where the story is going to go now.
had low expectations because its genshin story amd leaks didnt make it sound great, but after getting past the slow start it was genuinely great. everything from furinas trial onwards was really good and even though people predicted a lot of the story beats they were done interestingly

also was happily incorrect, i was laughing at the >!melus and silver!< "death", thinking every dissolved person would be fine later on. but nope they actually stuck with it and it makes the graveyard scene actually impactful
    Yeah I assumed they would bring them back but no they actually stuck with those deaths and honestly I was pleasantly surprised.
        I was thinking of that too when I was about to play the quest
    The thing that made me think their deaths are permanent is the scene on the graveyard with all the hero talk. It was too emotional a scene for them to just reverse it. Then the navia "dream sequence" happened and it basically confirmed to me that melus and silver are gone for good. If they resurrected all dissolved people it would cheapen the previous scenes with vacher and navia, and would make the cutscene from last patch less cool since the stakes are actually lower. Glad they stuck with it being permanent. Melus and Silver are heroes ü•≤
    I was praying for them to stay dead as fucked up as that sounds lmao, but yeah love how they stuck with it
    I was disappointed when I read the leaks and started cursing Hoyo‚Äôs name for doing Furina dirty but doing the quest made me take it back.
        exactly how i felt. i was a little too obsessed (as an archon collector) with her being an archon, but actually playing the quest holy shit she deserves to *not* be an archon. after 500 years she earned her right to be a normal person with a normal life
Genshin‚Äôs lore may be nice, but I never had high expectations for Genshin‚Äôs story. But Lord was the 4.2 Archon Quest AMAZING. First time this game has actually made me feel this way about the story.
When the divine focalors reveal herself, I was literally chanting "please you do not be egeria", repeatedly bcaus im tired of new archons having the same face or biologically related to the previous archon trend lol.

Tho, its a shame we can't see egeria yet
Fucking AMAZING! This schizophrenic girl French girlboss is so based. I am amazed that they actually pulled through with our expectations and exceeded it even, lads at hoyo fucking COOKED. Also the ending of the archon quest and the story quest were unhinged, I fucking loved both hard

Fast edit: the part where they were showing furina daily life was fucking chilling, no woman can go through all of that and stay sane. But girlboss pulled through
    When she simle with eye covered in eye even if its not cinematic show how she is really broken insed. 
Trully female archon life is suffering before meet us. Also love the symbolism of furina opened her heart with showing her "act all of this time" to the traveler meanwhile focalor in other side explained everything to neuvillete... Focalor literally playing 5D chess with "fate" and celestia..
Also noticed the traveler did not ask for the sibling‚Äôs guidance anymore üíÄ and also Neuvilette did not mention the god name of the Pyro Archon.

I wanted to know who‚Äôs the 3rd descender who died and become pieces of gnosis‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs not the sibling because I guess there was a scene where sibling is looking at both the traveler and paimon on the interlude quest during 1.4-1.5?
    Neuvilette has answered the question about traveler's sibling in 4.0
    I think the Traveler just accepted the only ones who could know about their sibling are Zhongli and Venti
    Actually interesting that you mentioned it, coz assuming that our twin did travel all over Teyvat, what mark did they leave in Fontaine? In Sumeru, our twin was there to fight the miasma (?) with the aranaras.
        The twin was also involved with the whole Caribert incident in Sumeru
I enjoyed it, but I felt the part with the whale was underwhelming. Additionally, I was a bit disappointed that we see Skirk yeet Childe into the Abyss and then later someone just tells us, ‚Äúoh, he went back to Snezhnaya.‚Äù Like‚Ä¶alright then lol. The pacing was also a bit off throughout the entire arc.

I also don‚Äôt really understand why Celestia didn‚Äôt do anything about Neuvillette but okay.

I loved the development of Furina though! I thought that was great.

I think overall I still prefer Sumeru‚Äôs arc, but Fontaine was definitely an excellent addition to the story! It seems to be that Fontaine is setting up for a ton of future content.
    As far as we know Celestia is inactive at the moment, but with Neuvillette regaining his powers and Focalors deceiving Celestia, perhaps we'll see the consequences in future archon quest interludes? Celestia might be more active in Natlan? Only time will tell.
Peak. Best Archon Quest in the game. Absolute kino. I have no other words
Pretty much predicted the whole storyline from 4.0, but it still blew me out of the water. The OST, the amount of cutscenes, the writing are all really engaging. My one true complaint would be that the earlier part felt a bit sluggish, given how tight the writing was during Furina's trial.

Biggest lore bomb would be Surtalogi and the Third Descender. The Narwhal seems to come from outside of Teyvat, so who is Surtalogi to be able to tame such a creature and make it his pet? Is he also from outside of Teyvat, or is he like Gold, meaning he came from Khaenriah? I was also almost positive that the Third Descender would be Alice given how radical her ideas were to Teyvat, but given the new information, who's the actual Third Descender now? Is it a person we've already known about or is it someone entirely new?
This main story has destroyed me on a whole different level. It left me speechless. I actually had to step back for a good 10 min before I could continue.
    Same.. I still couldn't get my mind off it.
    i was thinking about the quest the entire rest of the night yesterday, went to sleep and am still thinking about it now today. it was phenomenal
I loved it a lot. Definitely felt like an upgrade compared to the previous archon quests. It was so cinematic, especially towards the end. It was such a rollercoaster of emotions tbh, with Melus and Silver I immediately started tearing up :(

And Furina, I really hope she gets some happy ending of sorts. I haven‚Äôt done her quest yet, but I hope she finds herself somehow. Spending 500 years being someone she was not must‚Äôve been so exhausting. Plus, she was left in the dark for a lot of it and was treated like a puppet. I really want her to be happy. She deserves it.

One thing that was off though was the whole segment with Childe. Like, we spent so much looking for him in the Fortress, only for him to appear like once??? What the heck. I expected to see more of him, not one appearance and poof. He was like, neglected this chapter :/ Like, why was he shown if this was how it was gonna end with him? Idk, I wanted more to this whole dilemma. Hope future quests will clear it up, but that part was disappointing.
Look Furina aside can we talk about the biggest loss we had in the game since Jibrael?





Melus and Silver‚Ä¶ 






It will take me longer than I‚Äôd like to admit to fully get over their deaths, they were so cool and loyal and now they‚Äôre gone forever‚Ä¶
Loved the archon quest. The one thing that annoys me is that stuff with the Hexenzirkel and R has previously been put into limited events. If someone starts now and never experiences that early Albedo event or Windblume, it‚Äôs going to feel really out of left field. I wish Genshin didn‚Äôt put lore into limited events.
I just hope Natlan and Snezhnaya doesn't use the same Archon plot point we've been seeing since Inazuma.

First we got the Shogun/Ei/Makoto body double situation.Then we get the Nahida/Rukkhadevata plot point.Now we have the Furina/Focalors one.

While each AQ uses this element in different ways, it's still too samey for me.
I hope they gave more spotlight for Furina at the end but it‚Äôs understandable considering her situation. Overall the whole quest was a FEAST for lore enthusiast like me. The story-telling and its structure are all upped from Sumeru as well. Thank you Fontaine!
Ok. Let me say the final thing

Fontaine's AQ-4.2 is the best one. PERIOD !!!
I really wanna know how the whole of Fontaine got flooded but that water didn't flow into other regions and made it flooded as well üò≠üò≠ but overall it was good, sad I didn't see Wriothesley involved that Kuch except for his fat useless ship at the end rendered useless
I managed to predict some of the outcomes. Like the oratrice was the "real" hydro archon and that furina was an oceanid created by the "real" hydro archon.

When i said furina was an oceanid/hydro eidlodon ppl were like nah thats false because the elemental sight doesnt show her as blue üíÄ
    Technically, Focalors/Furina was one of the oceanids made human by the previous archon, so Furina is actually human (especially now that Neuv did his thing that now prevents Fontainians to be dissolved anymore), the human half of Focalors that she left behind to fool the Heavenly Principles.
The whole Fontaine Acr was very enjoyable (mostly because I'm a fan of Ace Attorney and mysteries like this). Everything looks great!

But after the ending I caught myself on the weird feeling of deja-vu...

In Fontaine we end with a nation without an Archon as a ruler, just like in Liyue.

In Fontaine, we meet an Archon who (technically) had two entities of herself, just like in Inazuma.

In Fontaine, we (do not) meet an Archon who selflessly sacrifices herself, with the sacrifice never to be acknowledged by the nation she saved, just like in Sumeru.

I couldn't find any links with the Monstadt story, not at first glance. Saving the nation from big scary monster in the end, maybe?

These do not spoil the enjoyment of the story, but I do notice some key things repeating over the whole game plot.
I still enjoyed Sumeru's AQ more overall even if I generally enjoyed Fontaine's cast more than Sumeru's. 

Sumeru's twist was both simpler and more enjoyable in my eyes and some of the stuff like Wrio's ship, and the whole narwhal section kinda came a bit out of nowhere even with the very very light foreshadowing we got in earlier quests. The whole meropide act needed to be cut in half for more significant lore dives with all the twists in 4.2, but besides that it was a pretty good AQ imo. 

Furina story quest is also everything that Raiden's first story quest wanted to be but better so there's that.
Honestly thought Sumeru was better with its similar plot threads. Probably because Nahida is more likable than Furina.

Also I'd rather go a few more rounds of Samsara than slog through that prison section again.
The way I went in this annoyed with Furina and straight up disliking her‚Ä¶ holy shit did I change my mind. The whole sequence of scenes in the opera was genuinely the thing that made me cry the most in this entire game. So sorry Furina I was so fucking wrong about you
I gotta say, it was indeed amazing, 8.5-9/10 for me, I hope they continue like this in natlan as well
My thoughts vary depending on how I look at it. If I focus on the character narative of Furina/Focalors and Neuvi, it probably is one of the better storytelling i've seen in Genshin. (Furina's past scene hit me hard. Like REAL hard.)

But it falls apart when I look at the entire storyline as a whole. The story kinda dips from the moment the whale appears and everything beyond that feels like they were rushed and was only there just for the sake of tying up loose ends that were introduced in the story early on.

The lore drops with Skirk was interesting, but I couldn't help but think it was somewhat out of place and came out of nowhere.
    Same feeling. The whale and Skirk just broke the immersion for me. I felt like reading Naruto ending.
We let them cook for a reason
I don‚Äôt understand some things (Questions about AQ)

* In various trailers and quests previously we hear a mysterious voice talking to Neuvillette (like "you'll see much in human world" line). That has always been in Furina's voice. Focalors has a different voice. So who actually brought the dragon to the court? Or was it Focalors' plan but Furina's execution type of situation?
* Why does Furina have two version (black and white)? I guess from gameplay mechanic pov, it‚Äôs to symbolize her two arkhes? But why does she have two arkhes to begin with? She didn‚Äôt have the vision during the AQ, so why two outfits? And even if it‚Äôs just to show two arkhes and that's it, why does one of the version have short hair and the another have long hair?
* What is pneumaousia? I guess I missed it in any of the previous stories because I still don‚Äôt understand what it is. Neuvillette is the hydro dragon, he has complete authority on hydro element, sure. But why does he has control over pneumaousia as well?
    My attempt at answers, though I'm not sure if it's all 100% explained anywhere, so some speculation to try to connect the dots.

1. Furina was basically Focalors' face to the world.  Although we saw in the flashback that they spoke through the "mirror," this was basically a stage metaphor and doesn't necessarily mean they literally could only speak to each other via a mirror.  It's quite possible that Focalors was able to guide Furina on what to say in certain cases to help her will play out, as would have been the case with Neuvillette (as she makes clear in her scene with him that she was behind his role).  Obviously there was some classified info she didn't tell, even to Furina, to ensure she could carry out her role.

2. I think we can basically say that Furina is "acting."  The short-haired dark version is the "real human Furina" where as the long-haired light version is how people knew her when she was acting as Focalors.  Symbolically I'd say they are trying to symbolize that Furina is the "extracted" human side of Focalors, so they originally were the same person before the split.  I haven't seen an in-game explanation yet, but perhaps the fact that she can use both Pneuma and Ousia is supposed to suggest that she has kept some of the "aptitude" that allowed her to become archon in the first place.  Perhaps she dons the other "costume" in combat to help her focus her energy in the opposite direction (to act "in character").

3. The game explains it as properties contained in all life in Fontaine, and the collision of these two opposing energies can both cancel each other out and create more energy.  So it's sort of like a fantasy version of matter/antimatter (or energy principles like that) that is inherent to the region of Fontaine and people born there.  Since we now know that all the original Fontaine people were Oceanids transformed into humans using primordial water, and the whole region is suffused with hydro power, we can assume that this all stems back to the water.  So, because of that, as the dragon sovereign with domain over hydro, it makes sense that Neuvillette would now have full control over this as well.
        I don‚Äôt really agree with the 1st one though. One of the biggest struggle/sacrifice of Furina is that she was all alone. She did not have anybody to confide to, didn‚Äôt have anybody who can know her secret, talk to her about it. I don't think Focalors talked to Furina ever since she started playing god.....
            Well, Focalors certainly wasn't going to substitute for a "companion" either way, because she's the one that put her up to this cruel responsibility in the first place.  What Furina was looking for, to be less lonely, was a friend -- someone she could confide her secret to and who could empathize with what she's going through.

I'm not necessarily suggesting they were constantly talking to each other or anything -- perhaps it's been centuries since she did any intervention at all.  But, Focalors was definitely the one who setup Neuvillette's role as part of her plan, so one way or another it was her "will" that was guiding that to happen.  Based on what we know of Furina's personality and the truth behind it all now, I would still tend to believe that somehow that was the voice of Focalors to Neuvillette coming through, and not just part of Furina's act.
    Focalors and Furina have the same voice actor. Pretty sure that's Focalors telling him that.
        Focalors in game (in the AQ) talks very differently with a sort of deeper voice than those trailer lines though. Neuvillette also did not look like he ever seen Focalors before when he met her in the AQ. There was no sense of familiarity in the tone. (imo, I could be wrong, but it really felt like this to me.)
    perhaps it will all be revealed in the story quest, but i cant say so because i havent done her story quest myself
        None of these gets any answer. I have done the SQ
    Same. I want to know how they met, sudden change of character (Focalors and Furina is quite different in character, I think) would give away something off.
    she got her vision in her story quest
Not a fan of how Skirk just popped in at the end and said the whale was just a pet...like what?? doesn't that mean that full dragon powered up Neav = the original archons was on a same level as...Surtalogi's pet? Rhindottir, who is a member of the Hexenzirkel, is on the same level as Surtalogi...but the Hexenzirkel "dared to challenge the Anemo Archon"... the power scaling in Tevyat is kinda wacked lmao
    Nah don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôll defeat Surtalogi like all the other earth-shatteringly strong weekly bosses by collecting some funny coloured orbs and going pew pew üòÇ
        When skirk said she was going to slash 3 millions times i was like "don't worry the traveler will stil whoop your ass if there is an occasion.
    The hexenzirkel never "dared" to channenge the Anemo Archon. Form the cutscene "One upon a time, it even challenged the Anemo Archon itself". Whcih doesn't really imply anyhing about their strength. Not to mention Venti is most sus archon, he has like the seconds biggest feat of power of any archon in the Lore lmao after Morax, but somehow is the "weakest".
It was alright

The big picture plot was great, loved the revelations regarding the archon and whatnot. The furina and ageria scenes were fantastic. Loved how they handle their characters. The lore drops were really cool. We're getting into the abyss and other-wordly business now which is really hype.

but again, so many scenes were completely unnecessary. A good portion of the quest gave me 4.1 flashbacks (which again should have only been one act because jesus christ meropide... never again please). Was us touring the city necessary? Was all that talk about hunting really necessary? Also, we are with the freaking hydro dragon at full power and with skirk, and we barely ask anything????????? For the love of god mihoyo, if you don't want to reveal certain things then stop making us interact that way with know-it-all characters only to blue ball us by not making the traveller ask anything. It was already flimsy with nahida, but I accepted it because she didn't know much yet and "it would take time to search irminsul" or whatever, but now it's just too much.

Also, why do you put so much effort into a boss battle, and then cut it short for the quest???? I felt soooooooooooooo underwhelmed when it instantly died, like wtf, isn't it supposed to be some super powerful abyssal monster or whatever? I didn't even use my well-built characters. Blue balls man, again.

Talking about the boss, wtf was up with the music? Like, the first part is great, builds the tension nicely, then it hard cuts into dubstep (which btw is a really odd choice, it really destroyed any form of tension for me... but it's fine, whatever)... and then it hard cuts back into the previous music... Please make transitions damn it. Like, at least fade it out.

And - sorry I'm circling back to the pacing, but it's an ever present problem in genshin - that transition from the skirk conversation into the end cinematic where the flood happens then instantly ends.... to then the epilogue was so jarring. And the flood in general, the fact that it happens then resolves in a single cinematic just doesn't sit right.

Also, the heavenly principles just got deceived... any words on the consequences...?

Also also also, is it just me or the whole narwhal business feels a bit shoehorned in? Like, we learned from a very quick cutscene at the end of 4.1 that it's... an entity, that exists. That's it. And then suddenly towards the end of the entire fontaine chapter, we learn it's apparently the reason behind everything - and exactly at that moment it shows up and we kick its ass. Like??? ok I guess??? And in general, so many out of the blue revelations that don't feel earned at all. Couldn't the 4.1 quests have built up all of that instead of whatever the hell we did at the fortress?

I'm overall still quite disappointed with fontaine. It started so well, and act 5 was still pretty good overall... but yeah. The story in itself is better than inazuma (though at least inazuma was shorter), but worse than sumeru I'd say - especially when it comes to execution. Because again, the big picture is very good. It's just the setup and delivery that is lacking big times.

&#x200B;

Anyway. This is just a first reaction, I'll let it simmer for a while before forming an actual more concrete opinion.

(a final thing - I really wanted to punch paimon a couple of times, but especially at navia's father's grave. Jesus the game would be so much better without her it's not even funny)
    Haha, didn't expect to find a somewhat matching opinion  regarding the story. 

Though one thing that I may add is how much I hated the fact that this game is already goes on for so long, and yet the heavenly principle never shows up or do anything after that opening cutscene. Focalor literally deceived them and there is no consequences, like whats the point for all being scared or having a quote of "never make enemy of a divine" if there are no real threat regarding them.

Overal super dissappointed for the fact that there are no heavenly principle involvement for this quest, if they added their involvement into the story super duper late, hoyoverse better have a good explaination regarding them or else is kinda dumb to have them eventually lose to the traveler after doing exactly nothing throughout the game
        Yeah, especially since it undermines ageria's entire plan. Like, what's the point of deceiving them if they won't react either way? Unless I'm missing something? 

The lore in this game is great, so I'm sure there's a good reason. But it doesn't change how disappointing it feels right now.
    Oh and you are so spot on about paimon, there is no words that can describe how much I hated her by acting like a kid and asking a dumbass question to navia when she is grieving on her father's grave.


The story already goes on so far and she didn't do anything noteworthy of being an actual useful companion, at least make her do something (which actually can also progress the main story plot) or just cut her out of the story when she isn't needed. I mean she is just usually left out anyway if traveler is having a "heavy" conversation with some character
    I've made the mistake of starting the trial bit whilst dinner was cooking and boy that bit just goes on forever without a break. Then the slow walking from area to area in her world. 

I'd appreciate the stories a lot more if they didn't make everything so damn long.
    Yeah I agree with basically everything.

I had a hard time taking the quest seriously because of how lightheartedly the characters, especially Paimon, were acting/talking.  We're all gonna die and Navia's two closest companions died -> YAY FOOD!

Also I feel like there were a lot of things that seemed important but were just glossed over.  Focalors tells us that her original sin was actually the original justice.  Okay but why?  Because if you don't explain it's literally just "because we wanted it it's justice" which doesn't make much sense.

Overall, Fontaine went from my favorite (Act 1-2) to mid/least favorite (Act 3,5).
    I think people aren't critical enough of these game's stories, I really think they need to cut out 40% of the writing especially when it's not an interesting way of showing what's going on. Short and sweet would make it better. Just cut the filler and put efforts elsewhere.
It was a mixed bag for me. I really enjoyed some of it, but I disliked how Furina just sort of...disappeared from the narrative after she was revealed as a false Archon. That was pretty underwhelming.

As a Furina fan, tho, I will say some ppl here are being dramatic (fitting, ig lol). Sometimes characters are miserable. I know it sucks, esp in a Gacha/anime game where you're encouraged to attach yourself to specific characters, but Furina's life will improve. Read some fluff. I intend to write some :)
    I thought her "disappearing" from the narrative there was thematically consistent for many reasons, honestly.  The role she'd been made to play for so many long years was finally over, and without her "role" she's got no part on the stage anymore.  It's absolutely tragic for her character at that point in time, because her whole character is tragic... but Focalors' gambit was to abdicate her power to begin with, and that also "frees" Furina.  This is why her character quest is >!all about processing what happened and learning to rebuild -- despite trauma, to step on the stage again and being recognized for it!<.

I mean, to me, the most tragic part was that the one time she had the glimmer of maybe being able to open up to someone, we stabbed her in the back.  They sort of absolved us of some guilt for that later by suggesting that, in the end, she wouldn't have "faltered" after all, but yeah.  That the whole trial was actually us playing directly into the hands of fate all along is a particularly cruel trick, but was again thematically consistent with what was foreshadowed.

In the end, although the story was "cruel" to Furina in many ways, I think it's a very powerful place for her character to rebuild from -- to really rediscover what it means to live as human from here on out.  As you say, her life will improve from here now that she can truly be herself.
        She stuck her hand into the water from the primordial sea she was ready to end it all my heart
            Or hope to pull it off and prolong the character as long as she can, even risking her life for it.
        I've only just started her character quest and i'm excited to see where it goes! I didn't expect genshin to give a healing from depression girlie but I'm very happy about it.

Yk, reading your comment and mulling over more, I think my actual issue w/ 4.2 was the Traveller's lack of....idk, feelings? Empathy? Maybe it was just the ENG translation, but they seemed either indifferent to Furina or interested only insofar as they could get information ("This is great....I can get the information I wanted," they think, watching Furina have a breakdown lol?). I think their lack of reaction made Furina's misery feel unappreciated, like it didn't matter to anybody, despite character voice lines calling Furina amazing etc.
            I guess I can sort of see where you're coming from in a way, but it's because the main thought in the Traveler's head was "we need to try to stop this tragedy from occurring."  This was emphasized in the little "retrospective tour of Fontaine" while they asked everyone how they would handle the prophecy if it occurred.

At that time, they really thought that Furina's withholding the truth was potentially condemning the whole nation to death, and they couldn't at all understand why.  I think the Traveler was truly, genuinely hoping that Furina would open up to them privately before the trial so it'd all not have to happen (since they 100% legit wanted to help), and they did show that the Traveler was sad that it came to that.  And then, when meeting with Furina later on the stage, they still had that in the back of their mind: I need to figure out the missing piece of the puzzle so we can save Fontaine.  Keep in mind, all this time they've been forced to play this "detective" role, they've gotten the hint from N that it's possible to change fate a bit, and they think tons of lives are at stake.  (They also aren't seeing what Neuvillette is seeing, which we had partly seen.)  At the end when Furina reveals that she can't tell them, and reveals all her deeply personal reasons why, the Traveler can only accept her decision.  It's absolutely tragic, but it also doesn't get them closer to solving the problem.

In the end, I think it's really the difference between us in the audience and the Traveler as one player on the stage of fate.  In this case, the Traveler doesn't really fully represent us in the audience -- we can be full-on sympathetic to Furina because we know that one way or another we will end up fighting the boss and the day will be saved.  (You know everyone in Fontaine is not going to die because they just announced Navia as a character coming in 4.3, for instance!)  But the Traveler is living in the moment with the weight of the world on their shoulders.  No matter the obvious tragedy of Furina's life and all she went through, you can't really weigh it against the tragedy prophesized to unfold over all of Fontaine.  The Traveler was really not in quite the right state of mind to whole-heartedly sympathize with Furina in that moment.  Maybe they could have done a bit more to make that a bit more clear, but I did think it was there.

Definitely enjoy the character quest.  I think it should be considered "required reading" for sure.
        >the most tragic part was that the one time she had the glimmer of maybe being able to open up to someone, we stabbed her in the back.

This seems to be the major reason CN social platforms are trash talking the story of this patch from what I've seen

Edit: **One of** the major reasons. Another is that some believe that Furina deserves a much better ending, pointing out "Even Scara gets a better ending when he most certainly is even more sinned"

Edit #2: I was browsing on Tieba for context, which has some of the less friendly communities to Mihoyo. With the haters trying their best to find an "appropriate/justified" angle to point their fingers at Genshin, it shouldn't really be surprising that most of their screenshots they were quoting is negative reception to the story. **In addition, they are somewhat twisting the story to make it look worse to those who don't play**, *possibly in an attempt to worsen the paradigm on hoyo games*: For example, >!Furina eats macaroni daily because she isn't into cooking, but the haters claim this is proof that Furina is paid poorly and can't afford anything else. Her living place also clearly isn't as bad as the "sewers".!< When I manually try to search related topics on Weibo, for example, the negative voices seem to be much "diluted", so to speak.
            It was definitely a gut-punch to me as a player; it legit made me feel like a bad guy in the moment, putting her so obviously through more pain.  But, yeah, from everyone's point of view in-game, they were desperate to try to save Fontaine, and it's extremely hard to trust in someone whose only message is "trust me" when you know they're lying about who they are and they stubbornly refuse all chances to come clean.  There needs to be *some* basis for such a deep expectation of faith, and Focalors provided absolutely none.

So anyway... the way everyone acted was to me 100% realistic given the circumstances, but yeah... it was harsh.  I actually liked that the authors went there -- I think it's okay for them to make us uncomfortable at times, as sometimes being the bad guy in pursuit of the greater good is a fact of life -- but yeah, I can see how it'd be a controversial choice.
            >This seems to be the major reason CN social platforms are trash talking the story of this patch from what I've seen  
>  
>Edit: One of the major reasons. Another is that some believe that Furina deserves a much better ending, pointing out "Even Scara gets a better ending when he most certainly is even more sinned"

Do you happen to know if that's the general CN consensus on the story or would this be more similar to like going to twitter and picking out a random tweet about the story? (Not that i'm doubting you just curious). I'm interested to know how the other communities are taking the story, would be nice to see if you had any more info/summary
                At the very least that's the consensus **of those who hold negative opinions towards hoyo/genshin, including disheartened players whom they quoted.** Of those I seen that is. (Animosity towards hoyo is rather common in a few other communities I browse)

I've yet to hear voices from rather pro-Genshin communities like Bilibili content creators for example, to be perfectly honest, and I assume they're busy indulged/analyzing and haven't bothered to counterargument yet, if they intend to do that at all.
                    I see, thanks for satisfying my curiosity! I did see your second edit too which helps puts thing into perspective.

Can't say I completely disagree with the "some believe that Furina deserves a much better ending, pointing out "Even Scara gets a better ending when he most certainly is even more sinned"" part, >!it did feel like Furina herself (Not focalors) was kinda forgotten at the end of the AQ. We didn't even get to see her off :( But I guess after what happened it makes sense she probably didn't want to see anyone!<
    On the other hand, Furina gets a whole epilogue of her own in the form of her story quest (one of the best in the game), so it's not all bad
    I'm fine with her suffering, but it's just weird how in a game where characters like Scaramouche and Ei get slaps on the wrist for their misdeeds, a character who really didn't even do anything of her own volition wrong gets (in game) hate to this degree.
        I mean, it does fit since she's a celebrity as well, it's like when celebrities/famous people in general IRL get exposed for some shit that should be otherwise just a small thing but got blown up out of proportion.

Barely anyone knows about Scaramouche's existence and Ei... well majority of Inazumans still revere her and Inazuma was based off the era in where the rulers had absolute say in things and were pretty much seen as divine beings, except in this case their ruler was a literal God, and the one that protects them at that + it was only a small part of Inazuma's population rebelling against her. 

Furina's case does feel the most human, which could be why we feel that she got too much hate but in reality, things would not be far off from what occured in game. Hell, it'd probably be worse lmao
            > Furina's case does feel the most human

I mean, yeah -- this is literally it.  Furina, as a "human," had to face the human consequences for Focalors' decision.  From their points of view, Furina herself was lying to them for 500 years to believe in her as their god when she had no powers at all (and the true god was nowhere to be seen).  Even if they may find out that she was told to do so by Focalors, and know objectively that she was doing it for their own good, it doesn't soothe the pain of betrayal, and she is the "face" of it all.  Is it a totally logical reaction?  No, of course not.  But especially in places like Poisson where the pain is fresh, it's not going to stop people from playing this sort of "what if" even if it's unreasonable.

I mean, if they truly sat down and thought about it, what were they going to do even if she *had* told them all along she was no god?  Could they have predicted it?  Would someone else really have been able to solve it and prevent it from happening?  It's completely illogical, but right now they need someone to blame, and Furina's betrayal gives them an easy scapegoat.

People may not be able to fathom the will of the gods, and may not understand why any tragedies are allowed to happen if the gods are really all-powerful beings.  I'm sure many in Watatsumi to this day still consider the Shogun's actions to by inexplicable (since they basically are, by human standards).  But people can understand when a human lies to them, no faith required.
        I think this is more a testament to how far they've come in terms of writing quality since Inazuma's absolute dumpster fire of an AQ and story quests till recently. Inazuma's archon quest at this point needs a full-on rehaul at some point in the future cause anything related to it sticks out in an extremely ugly fashion now.
        I think the problem is seeing bad things happening to characters as "punishment". Furina is a tragic and impactful figure *because* she doesn't deserve the things that happen to her. If she did, it would no longer be a tragedy. Not that I'm comparing the level of writing quality, but you wouldn't go up to Shakespeare and be like wow I think you did Romeo and Juliet dirty, don't you think their fighting families deserve to be punished instead of them? The emotional core of the story is that yes, indeed, Romeo and Juliet did not deserve that.
    Pretty much in the same boat. I enjoyed the story itself but how Mihoyo utilized >!Furina, NOT Focalors and seeing her conclusion in the actual AQ is honestly bringing the enjoyment down a bit for me. I just hope her story quests gives her a bit more relevance because the way she just disappeared towards the end left a sour taste in my mouth and honestly, isn't giving me hopes for her relevancy in the future. Was hoping both Neuvillette and Furina would be a duo but the ending of the AQ basically felt like Mihoyo slapping me and telling me otherwise!<
Great. But the Whale fight was a bit disappointing with how abruptly it ended
I‚Äôm still sad Melus and Silver are dead :( I‚Äôm also kinda sad Navia didn‚Äôt really mention them again at the end of the quest
The best AQ by far. I stayed up for 3 hours+ just to finish it while navigating the dam character quests I started but didnt finish. The Archons deserve happiness T_T.

Fontaine > Sumeru > Liyue > Mondstadt > Inazuma AQ.
    damn liyue in third? it had like 10 good minutes and 4 hours of fetch quests.
        The finale really bumped it up for me and none of the quest throughout felt meaningless. They also technically improved it further through Beisht and Chasm. I think Liyue is the only one so far to see continuation after its original chapter.
        Liyue's finale is still one of the best moments in the game.
        I mean compared to Inazum which was basically 70% worthless build up to an under cooked finale. Liyue doesn't seem that bad im comparison... As for Mondstadt I find it on par with Liyue.
            Inazuma was mishandled but it wasn't until then where I fell in love with the story. I'd say liyue was my least favorite and mondstat only better for nostalgia reason, but that's just my opinion
agree. it went well beyond my expectations tbh. I thought sumeru's story was going to be hard to beat but Hoyo absolutely delivered! The writers deserve so much praise for making such a wonderful and captivating story!
So bittersweet but thematically ON POINT, emotional damage üìà, focalor/furina‚Äôs final dance was so heart-wrenching. And seeing neuv becoming a sovereign who has grown to appreciate humans was absolutely satisfying. Plus wrio commanding the ship üòò

I wanna replay this AQ. Praying hoyo will let us replay all AQ and SQ.
It was so good, very suspense and emotional archon quest. I didn‚Äôt realize it took me 4 hours to finish it, still very worth it.
I know everyone have been raving about focalor furina but

navia part... When she got stand trial gave me chills.

Can someone explain how the hell neuvillette managed to save her in time? Is the court happening in the primordial seawater consciousness or?? How tf did he manage to save her or reached the opera epiclese?? And how are the Oceanids not afraid of him?
    Silver and Melus managed to protect her until Neuvillette could rescue her, the reason they could do that is because >!Primordial Seawater + people from Fontaine does not actually kill them but rather return them to their original form (but since they spent all their life as a human if they turn back to Oceanid they would have no idea how to use the shapeshifting ability normal Oceanids would instinctively know how to use)!<
I was not expecting depresso impact at the first 10 min of the quest....Navia reaction to Melus and silver was fucking rough.
Felt really bad for furina ....... Also when she was just going to open up but lyney open the door ....it was also heartbreaking
    I don‚Äôt think she was going to open up. With the play scenes in Furina‚Äôs mind, she ended up not saying anything, chances are the same would‚Äôve happened if Lyney did nothing
For me, the quest cemented that I‚Äôm no longer interested in Genshin‚Äôs archon quest/storytelling in the AQ. I can see why so many people liked it‚Ä¶and it just landed flat for me.

The stakes felt empty. Every twist (except the random feeling answer that the prophecy was about a space whale that is actually a pet?) felt over telegraphed in a way that wasn‚Äôt satisfying. It would have been more interesting to me if Focalor‚Äôs plan hadn‚Äôt worked perfectly or it felt like there was some setback‚Ä¶some risk of things spiraling out of control.

This isn‚Äôt to say the storytelling was bad‚Äîthe Furina sequence revealing the cost of her pretending and that moment she cried in front of the 20th generation descendant was gut wrenching.

It just‚Ä¶isn‚Äôt interesting to me anymore. It feels predictable and safe. And I think that‚Äôs fine. I still like the world quests and exploration and I‚Äôll focus on enjoying those.
The story was really good but i hate how Focalors went just "ha, all acording my plan!", that was the most cliche thing ever and worst way to explain everything, it's not that it is bad, it's just that they could have done it so much better.
I think they REALLY dropped the ball on furina by making her a different flavour of Ei/Shogun. It removed everything that I found great about her no longer apply to her. A real shame too.
Tbh im kinda mad, this is easily my favourite archon quest so far, i loved every second of Furina/Focalors story (actual Jesus Christ of genshin)... BUT it wouldnt be genshin if some weird thing didnt happened (im in the middle of the Furina's story quest now)

At the beggining - Navia just lost her bodyguards (who were like family to her), and she's crying at her father's grave. Paimon was like "oh no navia whats wrong?" like what the fuck do you think is wrong lmao, at least she said sorry so its fine but still worth pointing out cuz its like that every time something sad happens 

And at the end - they emphasized that Furina (human) suffered for hundreds of years, Focalors sacrificed herself for people, and conclusion was like... cool story bro? Furina just moved out and is eating macaronis every day, and Traveler didnt event think of, idk, talking to her? Even though she witnessed her whole life story. And to make it more funny, her story quest begins with "oh you look for an actress? I know one that was acting for 500 years and it almost broke her mid, maybe we should ask her"

I know that her story quest will probably adress all that, but honestly ending such an amazing archon quest with <black screen> "Sooo traveler are you ready for an interview?"... i didnt like it.   
Still, as it was my favourite quest, 9.8/10 (-0.2 for alldat /\\)
i thought it was amazing. i have a couple of complaints, tho.

1) i feel like the impact of focalors dying was lost a bit bc of all the lore dump we got. 

2) i would have liked to interact with furina again at the end. poor bb. i actually was under the impression that both focalors and furina were going to die, and i now thinking about it that would have been *extremely* dark. part of me wishes they went w that route, but i'm happy w how the quest turned out either way. lord knows i already cried enough lol

3) i'm not sure if the other characters in fontaine just aren't aware of it, but i would have liked it if more ppl (at least the characters that are in the know) would show or say something about focalors and/or furina. homegirl really was gaslighting them the whole time

let's say what i did enjoy from the aq

1) the music. oh my god, fontaine has the best music IMO. whoever the composers are did a fantastic job. i really wish i could have attended the concert in my area

2) the sudden change in neuvillette lol. i found it very funny that he first says: "we cannot kill the whale" then once focalors dies he's all like, "we are killing the whale." 

ofc, i enjoyed more things,but i can't remember them atm
Not really a fan of childe not getting any voicelines. I'm also really not a fan of the whale being from space and skirk referencing a bunch of that kinda stuff so casually. Not that I have an issue with a character bringing it up casually, as that's the point to show that skirk is used to it, but it being that at all feels like it's needlessly complicating things. Was really hoping for it to skew more towards being about the primordial one or something like that.

Other than that, the furina and focalors stuff was really great, and most everything else was solid.
    so from what I can understand there are 2 particular categories: Descenders who travel to Teyvat from other worlds and the other group are people who are capable of travelling from Teyvat to other worlds (Alice). not sure what category Skirk master is
after the AQ, Furina already got highly recognized as a true God of justice by ZhongLi, Ei and Nahida from their voice lines. This is some kind of BECOME GOD level sacrifice, I dont know why ppl here still ignore her or think they made her dirty. She is the most shining GEM of Fontaine.
Fantastic quest, but once the whale appeared the rest of it became very rushed. The boss fight was underwhelming save for the music, skirk ending up with a design sadly outclassed by all of her concept arts, and childe being given almost no attention at all until we're casually told he's recovering in snezhnaya off screen were all disappointing to see. Not to mention furina completely disappearing for the rest of the archon quest.

I was honestly upset we didn't get to learn anything about the pyro archon. I'm so tired of being kept completely in the dark with everything related to natlan. At least we know they have a lot of hot springs and dragons i guess.
It's pretty nice that this time, the Fatui actually aren't the baddies and are actually good guys. It felt weird seeing them described as "Friendly Neighbors". Probably the only time where I thought them getting a Gnosis wasn't that bad.
I feel like they had a lot of pacing issues with this one; the first half seemed to drag a bit then all the sudden we just get a massive lore dump in the last 5 min basically explaining the entire 4.0 AQ; almost feels like they ran out of dev time and had to rap it up.

Also was kinda let down on the whale just being a "pet" instead of this eldritch abyssal horror. 

but Furinas story quest afterwards was a really nice epilogue

I hope in one of the 4.3++ quests goes into the fact there is no longer a hydro archeon and the implications of that.
It was good, but raised a lot of red flags about the future of the story. Not in a way of bad things happening in Teyvat, but in the sense that they will completely lose control of the story
I‚Äôm gonna be a little negative since everyone has said the positive things about the archon quest

Story was great but it was pretty unsatisfying. 

The whale fight was boring and anticlimactic. The fight didn‚Äôt have the same excitement as scaramouche or signora and then Skirk comes in and just kills it off. Then she says a bunch of lore dump and leaves. What about Childe? We know he‚Äôs alive and went back to snezhnaya but we couldn‚Äôt even talk to him. Also, apparently this whale is just some guy‚Äôs pet? So you‚Äôre telling me this whole disaster happened because he (and Skirk) couldn‚Äôt keep their pet in control?

Furina‚Äôs story was great but after it‚Äôs all over, she‚Äôs just gone and done? Like, she suffered for 500 years for the people of Fontaine and she‚Äôs barely thanked or appreciated. Then she leaves and doesn‚Äôt get a very happy ending that truly feels like her suffering paid off.

The large flying ship was cool and all, but if the water level receded right away after it rose, then was it really that significant? 

What about the people who dissolved? We know from the archon quest that dissolved people aren‚Äôt truly dead, but turned into oceanids. And then what? Where are they? Are they okay? What about silver and melus? What happened to them and what are they doing now? It‚Äôs just unsatisfying to leave them dead(oceanidified). Either just make them all dead or resurrect them somehow.

What the hell was the Knave doing while all the chaos was insuing? Sure she was doing stuff outside and helping people but it‚Äôs not very satisfying for us the players.

All the lore dump is great and all but we‚Äôve barely gotten any answers to existing questions. We only got new information and new questions.
    people who got dissolved before Neuvillette gets his powers returned stayed "dissolved" at least for this current time, they are not dead however so there is a chance that Neuvillette in the future might be able to bring them back somehow
        Sure that ‚Äúcould‚Äù happen in the future, but as of right now it feels like we just say ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs done is done‚Äù and dont even wonder whether we can save them with Neuvillette‚Äôs power. And it‚Äôs exactly because they aren‚Äôt truly dead that it is annoying. If they are actually just dead, then yeah we can‚Äôt bring the dead back to life, but they aren‚Äôt and the traveler and Neuvillette knows that
    Furina's story is continued in her story quest
4.2 Archon Quest still suffers with that goddamn white text on a black screen/background thing. I was hoping they would reduce that kind of transition because of previous new transitions from the past archon quest.
Notice how most of the people in this thread bashing the quest heavily are specifically mad about two things.

1. That Furina is intentionally made to be a miserable character and treating that as if it's bad storywriting. It's not, you are mad she didn't get treated the way your preconceived notions of how an Archon should. I even saw one person saying they're quitting Genshin from how they treated Furina. Massive WOP, that comment got me laughing so hard
2. Neuvillette getting the spotlight instead of Furina

I'm telling you, these people are stagnating the real potential of the story. The two legitimate complaints I've seen here is the whale boss fight resolution, and perhaps the pacing of the remaining sections of the story quest. Hoyo took an amazingly good risk with the direction, and you can see why judging from these responses.

Anything besides that, all I've seen are genuinely baffling quote on quote "arguments" on why this quest is on the level of Inazuma Act 3, if not worse. If this isn't some elaborate joke, then I have to be underestimating the amount of children in the subreddit writing these ridiculous responses.

I think I need a second from laughing too badly
    Could not have worded it any better üò≠ Furina's whole conclusion is that she's human- and right now, her miserable state is a painfully clear and stark show of her humanity. And every Archon we've seen really has also shown a lot of humanity despite their divine status- Furina simply shows it a lot more on account of her finally shedding a "character" she's had to play for centuries. Dare I say she's one of the best written characters we've had so far. 

And agreed, the whale boss complaints make a lot of sense when you compare it to Shouki no Kami for example, so I understand those. But saying it's as bad as Inazuma is a huge stretch lol
        Honestly Furina playing the act of a GOD for HUNDREDS OF YEARS is one of the most impressive feats any character has done in Genshin. The amount of will power and resilience to pull of something like that is absurd and makes her one of my Favourite characters in the Game so far, the fact she did it for selfless reasons aswell. she did what most never could dream of doing. She deserves her rest.
    I don‚Äôt understand it frankly. People have complained for years that Genshin storytelling is too childish and lighthearted. They finally take a risk in Fontaine with taking the story in a darker direction with true representations of loss, sadness and suffering and suddenly ‚Äúoh no that‚Äôs too much, bring back the sunshine and rainbows!‚Äù Sheesh all I can say is I hope none of these people respond to the feedback survey and ruin it for the rest of us. This act was a breath of fresh air in an otherwise predictable and stale narrative experience.
    Don't know why you're being so condescending.

I understand what they tried to do, I just think they did it badly. And yes, how Furina was treated is part of that. If they want her to suffer fine, but the way she's treated is borderline nonsensical, especially by the traveler and Paimon. And there's lots of other details that are questionable too and make the future of the setting worrisome.

Is it better or worse than 2.1, I can't say. I certainly had more fun fighting Raiden than the camera of the whale, at least, so 2.1 wins by a mile gameplay-wise. And for storywise, remember people loved and adamantly defended 2.1 for like a month post-release too. We'll see if the same happens here once the hype wears down and people look at it more critically.
        Eh, I remember a lot of people shitting on 2.1 right out the gate, even though they did love some sections of it. Signora‚Äôs death was wildly controversial and a lot of people felt as if Raiden got off lightly, not to mention the info dump at the end and Scaramouche‚Äôs casual drive by where he did fuck all except bully the traveler, grab the gnosis, and gtfo‚Äôd

The one part people were defending in 2.1 was Raiden getting away Scott free with insane levels of neglect and letting the Commissions and her Puppet Daughter nearly drive the country to ruin from greed from the Commissions and Apathy from the Shogunator.
it was chill overall then went kinda downhill w skirk and the whale origin surtlogi or whoever else
I would say 8.5-9 up until the boss fight. Then it crashes down to like a 4. I don‚Äôt have any complaints about Furina‚Äôs character, but I really, really don‚Äôt like how they chose to end the quest.

>!the whale battle and resolution was so lackluster imo. The fight was so cool, but we barely get to hit the boss before it ends‚Ä¶like, that‚Äôs it? Compared to Scaramouche and Raiden, where we duke it out until the end, this one fight left me really baffled. I didn‚Äôt even get to appreciate the dubstep and it was over‚Ä¶We‚Äôre building up this whale to be a huge foe and then it‚Äôs just GONE. Like that.!<

>!They really should have played up the doom of the flooding of the city. Wrio‚Äôs big expensive ship shows up to save 4 guys then the water disappears like 30s later. It‚Äôs almost comical how useless it is. The sense of disaster appears then disappears way too quickly. And I don‚Äôt know how I feel about putting Furina‚Äôs resolution in her optional story quest rather than the actual AQ!<

>!Overall, I like what they were cooking, but it‚Ä¶I really don‚Äôt feel they quite stuck the ending. I have my problems with some plot points in Sumeru but I felt they executed the ending really well.!<

It really just needed a few more weeks in the developer oven to cook to perfection.
    >the whale battle and resolution was so lackluster imo.

How the fuck would you kill an eldritch pet of someone.
        No, I mean like, it was so short. You get one phase of the whale where you try it hit it as it flops around, then you randomly go fight the guy inside, and then it just ends. No second whale phase, it just cuts straight to >!Skirk casually yeeting it out of existence then everyone in Fontaine ‚Äúdrowning‚Äù.!< After doing the weekly boss version, I don‚Äôt see why they can‚Äôt let us do phase 2 in the story as well? We did it for Raiden, Scaramouche, Signora. We even beat up Dvalin all the way.

Idk for the big weekly boss of the whole chapter I was expecting more significance in the story. It was there, and then it was gone.
            The story quest especially Archon quest bosses need to be accessible for everyone, so the difficulty and length will not be hard. The first Childe boss when it was dropped was actually a bit challenging but large portions of the player base complained and said they were stuck and can't progress the story. 

So the devs need to consider the overall player base and the ability for people of varying character investment, skill level etc to progress the story. The domain version should be a bit harder.
                They added an option to decrease domain difficulty for story bosses with this update.

Alternatively, massively nerf the HP pool and mechanics and keep the phases, like they‚Äôve done with all the previous weekly bosses. Neuvillette will also heal you if your character dies (I think, my Charlotte died and magically revived with full HP at one point).

I don‚Äôt mind the boss being way easier or shorter for story mode. I just feel a story boss should showcase the complete fight and not stop halfway. It feels like if Apep ended with the turret protection phase, or Scaramouche ends once you hit him with the special action. I was ready to wack the whale, and then it just ended.
            To be far, when you finish Fontaine, you already powerful and have vast of OP characters under your belt with full set and proper team building and strategies. 

 Imagine you only has Mona and 4 stars units, your relics are still green, vapor team and fight against pre nerf Childe. I did.
at least let me install the damn thing first
    Had to do it fast before youtube and tiktok spoiled it all üòî
Ngl i did "psffh" at melus and silver's death thinking that they just doing a fake disney death (in my defense,its bcaus of the navia falling scene) and now.. wow navia really can't take a break huh
Ending lacked punch and the impact of Focalors betraying the Celestials is kind of not reflecting.

But the Furina arc was amazing
Someone explain how did babies survive the water levels rising. Ik it could be plot hole but that's the first thing that came into my mind.

No way no one died from it
>!I mean... It was a bit sad, really. The character we pulled in one of the previous banners becomes the next archon (sort of) and Furina goes heaven-knows-where (I've not done her story quest yet) and 500 years of depression was a bit much. Skirk also just casually tosses out Childe and the whale after we've weakened it, so like, the whole prophecy was just a result of Childe and the whale sparring, really? Also, the raised waters should've flooded the whole of Teyvat if they were \_that\_ high. Finally, did nobody really die from all of that water, even by drowning?!< There was also a loooooot of filler imo. Only the first and last sequence bits were particularly relevant.

Not sure how I feel about this one really. It was a bit absurd at the end and quite low-key throughout. I'd place Sumeru's in general, and the finale of Inazuma, over this one.
It didn't hit as hard as Sumeru's quest. Yes Furina's backstory was sad but not as much as [redacted] and Nahida. I also managed to one shot the final boss with my Raiden/Nahida hyperbloom team. So that fight felt like me fighting an hilichurl.  

I felt that the start of the AQ was a bit long. During act 1 to 4, I didn't really know where the story was heading. But I feel like they rushed the end too much with act 5. The trial felt like I was watching the game on x2. Then now poof, the giant whale magically appeared right in front of us. Then boom, Neuvilette has his full dragon power. And when we went to seal the whale, Skirk just appeared with her masterball and recalled her master's pet like a damn pokemon trainer.  

We didn't interact as much as we needed with Furina. She felt like a secondary character this whole quest.  

Though the voice acting was extremely good.
    act 3 was completely wasted imo (we only went there to find Childe and we never did), more time should have been spent on first Hydro Archon (Traveller needed to find out what happened during Cataclysm and Khaneriah) and the Whale. Act 2 was important though because it had loads of foreshadowing for Act 4 and Act 5
I think it was a really great story, but I do have some slightly mixed feelings regarding how Furina's story was presented in the context of the 4.2 Archon Quest, since it really does look like she was being used as a chew toy for the writers, despite everything she had done by acting out the role of the Hydro Archon for 500 years. 

Her Story Quest does alleviate it to a degree and ends the current story patch on a more hopeful note for her, but the AQ itself was still hard to watch. Granted, I suppose it being miserable to see was the intention. 

That aside though, there was a noticeable uptick in the quantity and quality of the CG cutscenes which was great, and my personal sadness for Furina aside, I enjoyed the quest, and I appreciated how there were actual stakes and consequences. 

~~Why does Skirk keep reminding me of a Seafood Flavored Herrscher of the Void though?~~
    > it being miserable to see

It wasn't the first time they pulled *that* off.

"I woke up in a flower carriage..."
    I agree with you. Despite Furina acting for a long time, in the end, she wasn't really acknowledged for her effort. The quest was only closed with Neuvillete saying she was tired and wanted to have some rest. I do wish at some point those who were involved with 'final opera' meet her and have some conversation. But maybe the dev have the segment kept for the next version. But for now, I really can't look at other Fontaine characters like I normally did. Probably including traveller seeing how she also pushes her to know the secret.

Personally, doing the AQ, I can feel Furina's tiredness and frustration on how she was hoping there were solutions for the prophecy while acting as a "God" for Fontaine people. I guess seeing in the end, how she was trying to help the Fontainian, but with the cost of those whom she holds precious despise her. It's something that gives me a deep impact. I...happy that I chose to pull for her and before doing this quest, I really want Neuvillete. But I don't think I want him at my party to do the journey afterwards. I don't blame him for what happened as this is what Focalors is planning for. Hmm... I guess another reason will be on how everyone is starting to get warm with the Fatui. And how easy the Gnosis to give away.
        > Furina acting for a long time, in the end, she wasn't really acknowledged for her effort

Umm no read Neuv's line about Furina
I was so engrossed that I didn't notice the battery draining from my mobile lmao. Thank god that I was able to finish it in time
Ending raised many more questions than it answered. Beyond the whole narwhal and skirk thing and just focusing on teyvat - why did the Heavenly Principles not intervene when Neuvillette regained his elemental authority? Sure Focalors deceived them, but surely they could sense when one of the dragons they usurped got their power back, especially considering how Dottore was fearful of possible reprisal from Celestia if Nahida would have destroyed one of the gnoses. This gives more credence to the "celestia is dead" theory.
    the sumeru quest told us that it seems like the heavenly principles is sleeping. Perhaps this wasent enough to wake it.
        but then why bother with egeria's plan....
Best quest so far hands down. From the emotions to the excitement and suspense. They've really upped their game. I can't wait to see what happens with the ordo, or what Dain will have in store for us in a few patches. 

Either way, the tone of the story is getting really dark...
Quest dragged a bunch and jumped all over the place then it just ends def a 6/10
Fontaine fucking cooked GOOD. Actual peak genshin
The patch just dropped‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è. My game hasn't even finished updating yet ‚ò†Ô∏è. How are y'all so fast‚ò†Ô∏è?!?!?!?
    Avoiding Youtube spoiler thumbnails at all cost.
Didnt plan on rushing it but it was that good üëè
My honest opinion is that anyone who has had to go conclude the Fontaine storyline like we did today deserve a hug because, damn, that was rough.
Furina‚Äôs trial got me tearing up and shit. I haven‚Äôt finished it yet but holy fuck, the JP VA had the BILLS DUE üò≠
Did Neuvillette absorb the power from the gnosis or Focalor; does the gnosis still have power?
It was a really big mix of emotions honestly.
Horrible pacing, a lot of filler, nice ending (probably best out of all AQ). Overall decent.
Actually made me tear up, and it surpasses sumeru AQ. The best story uptil now
Someone, please give Miss Furina a hug. Seeing her in tears like that, after learning of the burden she has had to carry for over 500 years, on her own. She does not need any more correction.
Furina JP VA did an awesome job, her shaky voice had ME shook. The last time I was on the verge of tears was the Rukkhadevata scene. Overall, this has to be the best AQ we have so far.
Definitely noticed that in the last memory scene where Furina was taking to us, she still decided that she wasn't going to tell us anything eventually. Even if we had more time in the magical box.
The best Archon Quest in my opinion.

Also, the part where >!Neuvillette received the Hydro Gnosis looked suspiciously similar to when Venti gave Dvalin the "power of the Anemo Archon".!<
The moment the real archon appear in front of Neuvillette has the Elsa showing up in front of Anna on the beach vibe. Absolutely beautiful.

I'm glad they made a full model of her instead of copying existing model like they did with Nahida's quest. That was much more powerful story telling to see her in her true form than seeing Nahida hugging an entity that is exactly like herself. I wish we had an actual designed model for \[redacted\]
Ngl, the boss was underwhelming
Story is 9/10 though
Best QUEST yet...they cooked TOO WELL... absolutely fantastic THIS IS PEAK GENSHIN
Melus and Silver üò≠
How does Furina have an entire kit when in the archon quest she couldn‚Äôt prove she had power of hydro
that was so fucked up
Im kinda didn‚Äôt understand the ending. Neuvilette is a leader of Fontaine now and everybody chill about that? Do they all know he is the hydro dragon with full power? Why is at so easy for people that Furina is no longer the Hydro archon and she is now some regular girl?
    to regular people, an Archon is basically just a really powerful god with mastery over the element they preside over (this is reinforced in the Trial about what the court thinks an Archon is). Neuvillette as far as regular people think is a god (he's been around over 500 years they know this) and he is well versed in using Hydro so as far as they are concerned he is the Hydro Archon, it helps that he is the Chief Justice as well.

They are "ok" with Furina being a regular girl because of the trial where the court judged her to not be the Hydro Archon (which was true).

They don't know about Dragon Sovereigns being the original Archons and all that, also they won't know about Hydro Archon position being destroyed so no more "official" Hydro Archons (Celestia on the other hand...)
Did it ever say why Childe‚Äôs vision was failing?  Also, why could he hear the narwhal?  I know he thinks about it a lot and it is part of his combat, but did the narwhal curse him or something when he woke it?

Also, I miss Melus and Silver, it‚Äôs weird seeing Navia without them.  I hope they get GITCG cards.
My only comment is it felt like I was in a long ass cutscene/domain and I can't take a breather. Bomb after bomb because story was chef's kiss.
Genshin writers cooked and delivered a plain story. I was expecting something to happen at all but as always I was disappointed. 4 hours and a half for what? It felt something interesting was missing the whole time. It started to get good at furina‚Äôs trial (after 3 hours of mission). When she gets the death penalty instead of finally doing something, confess, act like an archon being questioned and getting mad, no, she decides to stay still. The writers could have had her confess everything, leave the viewer with a ‚Äúwait what is she saying?‚Äùand then have all the neuvilette x focalors conversation. But they decided to tell everything the plainest way possible that is through a dialogue with another character that you have to read and is just too long (could have been resumed). Everything could have been shortened really. And then that‚Äôs it, that‚Äôs all the archon does, like the quest needed emotion. I cry super easily with films and that but this made me feel nothing, literally everything is so plain and bland that can‚Äôt deliver any emotions rather good or bad. The part of furina doing the act in front of the traveller was incredibly long as well, could have been shortened as well, which put me off. In general people is overrating this whole arch of the history of genshin. After coming from sumeru, this is just so plain. Cinematics are a 100/10 but that‚Äôs it, and mostly could have been longer. You are going to negative vote this but this is just my honest opinion and I have been playing the game from 1.0 and never got bored of it, but this, I expected something more epic? Emotional? Some kind of fighting that is not with a whale that appears randomly?
I don't understand why Focalor needed to kill herself. Every other Gnosis was just passed on from their Archons without them having to kill themselves. Even if it was to fool the Heavenly Principles, wouldn't they know something is amiss the moment Focalor's throne is destroyed? Yet there was no intervention.
Great quest. Made me sad. #justiceforfurina #justiceforchilde

I found the entire group (traveler and friends) pretty insensitive though like when traveler was just like "i need answers" before lunging to reach out to furina. Didnt even seem like mc/paimon cared about furina's welfare, given that the oratrice was about to execute the sentence. Mc felt bad eventually after witnessing the whole truth and yet didnt check on furina or at least apologize. Everyone was also indifferent to childe passing out after fighting  the whale. Paimon was just talking about othet stuff besides how childe is. No one talks to him nor asks bout how hes doing...
Gonna be a hot take but in the end all the quest was about how sad is Furina only to forget her at the end
I absolutely loved every minute of it.
From a story writing perspective I wasn't too fond of how many "shock factor" moments they used in their storytelling. But my nitpickings aside, I genuinely think this was the best AQ quest yet. Furina's probably the first character I've grown to care for since the launch of the game.
It's definitely one of the better ones.

I'm just confused as to why >!Giverny and Bernette managed to return back to human while Silver and Melus didn't.!<
Focalors is so Jesus-coded. 

Died for the original season of the people? Like sounds familiar
    \- Fontaine's teaser is called the Final Feast (The Last Supper)

\- A god in human form

\- Part of a plan to save people from their sin

\- Can walk on water

Yep
I really really enjoyed it except for that part where Paimon ruined like 25% of the quest with her dialogue.
I get that the narwhal is fairly unimportant story wise currently and they're just planting the seeds for the future but I'm not really a fan of how they went about it. Especially as a weekly boss it was incredibly underwhelming and mechanically wise kinda sucks.

Other than 10/10 literally my favourite quest in the game. Furina immediately went from a love-hate sort of character to definitely in my top 10(maybe even 5).
\----------------------------------------------------------NEGATIVE----------------------------------------------------------------

okayish, got bored out of my mind at the start. 

PAIMON SHUT UP. 

It's really a COINCIDENCE that the only ruin we visit during the Archon Quest was about exactly Focalors and that all the tablets were still understandable and that Freminet was about to find the last one and bring it back in perfect condition.

Got blueballed in the whale fight because they ended the fight early for no reason. And I don't understand why half of the fight is fighting an humanoid instead of the whale.

Still don't understand why tf Focalors had to hide by creating a body double if it's for her to die anyways in the end. I also loved the costume she had and kinda prefer it to what Furina is wearing, unlucky.

Still don't understand why Celestia doesn't react at all at what Neuvillette did to Fontainians, since the sin Celestia had problems with was creating a human race without their approval.

Still have gripes over the robot like animations, but it's cool that they added tears.

Felt that the whole "movie" part in Furina's spirit was forced, kinda like Demon Slayer flashbacks. I would've liked it the reveal to feel a bit more organical to actually get engaged with her hardships.

Lore dumps through interrogatory at the end of Archon quest are still questionable.

&#x200B;

\-----------------------------------------------------POSITIVE-------------------------------------------------------------------

Liked that for once, Fatuis aren't the BIG BAD EVIL who do EVIL things because they are the BIG BAD.

Skirk's design was cool, it was cool to see Tagliatelle back. It would be nice to know why his vision didn't work anymore.

Special mention to Freminet, the diver, who has a diving helmet, for never using it when he dives.

Traveler talked. wow.

The truth about Fontainians was cool.

\----------------------------------------------------------CONCLUSION---------------------------------------------------------

Overall, 6.75/10. Better than Sumeru ig. Might have misunderstood some things about the AQ tho.
Amazing archon quest ngl. I loved all of it. Probably my favorite archon quest so far. My only real gripe with it is no permanent change to the map. I didn‚Äôt want Fontaine to just be flooded now but I did want some sort of change happening rather than it just looking exactly how it did before the flood. Also that whale fight music was good but I wish the fight itself lasted a little longer.

Neuvi is my favorite character in this game so seeing him get his full powers back was cool though I did feel bad for him and for Furina.
I actually felt sadder for Furina than I did for Nahida. Really good story telling
    Her story is legit more tragic than Nahida. Nahida may have been physically confined, but having control over dreams, she could at least still communicate with her people and see distant lands. Furina's stuck pretending to be someone she's not for hundreds of years, knowing that making even the slightest mistake can end up killing everyone in Fontaine someday. And having to do all that while having the mind of a mortal.
It was dissapointing. Furina's story was painful, and that part was great...but the rest feels..i dnt knw, it doesn't make any sense to me. Where even is the hydro archon's throne anyway, where was that indemnitium nuke dropped?...it probably would have made more sense if the gnosis was destroyed or something like nahida threatened to do in sumeru aq. The fontaine AQ as whole was overly drawn out too for no reason imo. Still dnt knw why the prophecy was fulfilled anyway, since furina is not the archon after all.

But regardless. Downvote me if u disagree.
[deleted]
    She might not be the "real archon" . But she did take on the responsibilities of an Archon AS A HUMAN. Imo that makes her just as much of an archon as well.. The archons.
    She is the real archon though? The quest drove that home. If youve got a coin and on one side you have heads and on the other you have tails, it doesn‚Äôt matter which side you‚Äôre looking at, it‚Äôs still the coin.
    She still was, or at least part of her. Most of the "not the real archon" arguments were about a completely different person being the real archon which was not true.
    I mean, she technically still is? 

She's like, half an archon.
    I was one of them ü§° it's okay though she is still the archon of my heart and that's what matters most üòî
People said Furina is hated probably bcs of the attitude of people in Navia‚Äôs place towards her, and Navia seems hostile towards her but still help her, imo it‚Äôs a justified reaction from the citizens there,other than that she is still seen as a popular figure
I do love the writing and all but I can‚Äôt lie I personally just wished furina would stay as the archon and they didn‚Äôt take this route with her character being just part of a now sacrificed whole. It‚Äôs similar to how they handled raiden‚Äôs character, I wanted her personality to stay as it was - evolved, developed, matured like anticipated- but still in essence the same, because her ruling and having all that confident divinity to her was so unique and fun to see. Of course how they executed the real thing was amazing and very emotional but i really wished for something different. how‚Äôs she going to get a second story quest now, if she‚Äôs been a human all this time and forced to fixate on her appearance and prepare for the prophecy, what kind of groundbreaking lore will we possibly receive? Unfortunately I can only see Neuvillette getting a new quest, given he had more of an open ended end in the quest, with the whole keeping in touch with skirk thing. 

It‚Äôs sad, not in the way that it‚Äôs bad at all, but I‚Äôm just really sad. I loved her and Neuvillette‚Äôs fun and interesting dynamic, but that seems quite dismantled now. For the better I guess, since they went with this kind of route for her character. But imagine, somehow, regardless of whether it‚Äôd make sense or not - it was furina who stepped up to cleanse fontaine of their sin, proving herself as focalors the hydro archon. Sacrifice can be involved in some shape or form, everything ending in a magnificent trial, but she still gets to remain as she was advertised, how she first greeted the traveler. The satisfaction I‚Äôd have from witnessing the archon quest would be through the roof. And in the end, everything continues as it was with an air of peace and new questions. I don‚Äôt like how it‚Äôs over with her just becoming some mundane actress, like it fits the narrative they wrote but god it could‚Äôve been far more fulfilling than that üò≠
Not peak, it was decent like the Mondstadt one, maybe slightly better. Peak AQ is Sumeru AQ and it's not even close. Maybe because of that AQ it was a let down to me. 

Memorable scenes are Focalors suicide, Neuvillette getting his full powers and I guess that's about it.

I found the boss fight underwhelming and the conclusion of the prophecy was also kind of underwhelming.
I feel so bad for Furina to the point that I don't want to roll for her at all. I feel like just playing her is torturing her, because she is forced to play her role. 

500 years is enough, let her rest.
    Did you do her story quest?
Fucking phenomenal, except the flood at the end. Shit doesn't make any sense, and the somewhat disappointing conclusion for the noah's ship thing at the end.
As to your edit, it‚Äôs just misinformation spread from leaks. The only people who are angry at her are those form Poisson and then that anger is mainly just trauma from, y‚Äôknow, dying and then being revived.
Fontaine is peak. Peak Archon. Peak story. Peak characters. Peak exploration. Everything Fontaine brought to Genshin has been amazing.



It made Genshin's story now easily in my top 5 of all the games I've experienced, if not top 3
The reading comprehension devil sure as hell is working over time to day... The amount of people who misunderstood the entire Archon quest is... Certainly something... yeah.
For your edit i just want to point out that if a writer wants to make a newly introduced character liked by the readers the cheapest way is to have already established characters praise them. There's multiple examples of it in recent Marvel movies. Although furina's execution was much better
Wondering if I should have spent my saved primos in Neuvilette instead of Furina.

Kinda see her as waaay less significant of a character now.
Honestly, the quest was kinda... mid?

I didn't like the first two acts, the middle ones were fine enough. This one was more or less what was expected.

Let me get it out of the way - I hate this "OH BUT IT WASN'T THE REAL ME!" thing that Genshin seems to love doing. It essentially removes any seriousness from everything that happens because at any point, they can drop a comically large piano on Neuvillete's head and it turns out it's just a copy and nothing actually happened. I've never been a fan and I was hoping Furina was going to redeem herself by the end of the AQ and... nothing. On the other hand, Focalors looked FINE, I loved her dress. Also as a small sidenote, anyone noticed we got a LOT of feet shots from Focalors for no reason? If you told me someone at MHY had a foot fetish I'd believe you after that scene.

Anyway, back to Furina: there's no real redemption for her. At the end of the day, she was a puppet in a show she wasn't running, and her big moment was lying to everyone permanently until she was more or less forced into doing otherwise. Also, can we talk about how INCREDIBLY unsatisfying it is to Furina to have just... left? Understandably so, she was finally done living a lie and wanted to leave it behind, but the fact the traveller didn't even pretend to care about her a little bit just felt weird, especially as it became more and more obvious Furina was harboring something. "She's about to be sentenced to death? OH NO, we need ANSWERS! What? Her life? Oh yeah no, let her die. ANSWERS THOUGH!"

Yeah, that's just silly.

There was no redeeming "SO THAT'S WHAT SHE WAS DOING" big part or reveal that showed she was actually in control, only if a little. It was just "please feel sad for her because she's a pawn". Overall her story has to be one of the most missed opportunities in Genshin imo, and it took the winds right out of my sails in terms of maxing her.

And can we PLEASE address how Furina never really got back at Harley Chino? I'm not happy that we kind of just glossed over how she nearly killed Furina and she just took it and never mentioned it again, even now. On one hand I get it that the traveller telling Neuvi about it might've been a strange move but on the other hand... feels like something that should be more of a bigger deal than it was.

However, and this is because at this point I'm hating more than not - the scene where she starts crying without even noticing was GREAT. Like seriously, the VA did a great job (EN VA) but everything in that scene was great. Which ironically makes it seem worse when the quest ends without us ever doing anything in terms of learning about Furina, because a good portion of the quest was MHY telling us to be sad for Furina and then she just vanishes. Which didn't leave me feeling good at all, quite the opposite.

Furina aside, can anyone answer why did they kill Silver and Melus? For the life of me, it makes no sense. Why not kill off random NPCs? I thought both of those dudes were well received in the previous quests, no?

I mean, they're still NPCs. No one really cares that they died because they don't change the story, aren't playable and don't have dedicated story/events, so Navia's sadness would have been just as fine if they killed some other NPC we met previously. Just feels like a very cheap thing to try and get us to be sad or emotiomal when I was really just annoyed - their dynamic with Navia drastically helped her character. Why not just bring Florent or whatever the guy's name was back for a few scenes and THEN kill him? The idea would've been the exact same but we'd still get the cool dudes with Navia on future events. Overall this was one of my least favorite parts for sure right after Furina being a pawn you should feel bad for who disappears after.

Anyway, these are just my opinions.
Quest was very good, but I felt like there were a few problems with the chapter 5 story:

Narwhal fight was mid, Scaramouche, Senora, Raiden, and even Childe were better fights.

Travelers writing in the final chapter had a few moments were I think the writers forgot how to write the traveler, such as:

Traveler not using Electro/Anemo/Geo to save Navia even though they thought Navia would die if they touched the water.

Traveler not asking Skirk about his/her sibling.

Neuvillete making traveler waste 45 days (Probably shorter but this was the sentence he got) in prison despite the fact that it was in unnecessary and the charges were false anyways.

Also we got no new info on Natlan, as Captain was already known from Windrise.

Overall, Fontaine is probably the best Archon Quest, but I think Inazuma had a better finale.
Worst archon quest ever, they did Furina dirty
I used to think Genshin will never reach Honkai 3rd level of story.

I no longer think so... 4.2 AQ was simply amazing.

In more than one ways, what Genshin pulled off is even more grand and impressive.
it was ok until it ended with Gary Stu Neuvslop became ultimate hydro being of whole universe while Furina got stripped of her God/Celestia uniqueness and got reduced to mortal hobo.

I was kinda hoping that the story leaks was not fully legit or full and I really expected that Neuvillet will do something before the execution of Focalors (like stop the blade or gather remaining essence of Focalors and merge her with Furina to make her complete being again)... or at least share a bit of his power with Furina but nope. 


The worst thing is that 4.2 was last major plot-line patch so we will get now filler shit until Natlan. So in the end Celestia is totally ok with one of the Thrones got destroyed and one of dragons got their full powers... excuse me what the fuck? 0 reaction? Not to mention that info that Skirk has a master that is as strong or stronger than Gold and that whole whale boss was a just a mere pet that she just locked in pokeball in the end.


also I'm not a fan of the retconing stuff we learn one patch later: 4.1 Dragon Sovereign powers are in Gnosis 4.2 NOPE, Dragon Sovereign powers are in Thrones that were linked to God that won Archon war while Gnosis is just totally something else that is related more to Traveler and Descenders than to Dragon Sovereign. Same shit with vision: so yeee visions are given by Archons.... few patches later: uhhh lol no we are not giving visions

This shitty quest killed my hype and motivation for future Archons and potentially it hints that current ones (Zhongli, Venti, Ei and Nahida) may get "killed" at some point so Hoyo can throw 5 new flashy Dragon Sovereign into gatcha and into lore


**ARCHON QUEST? ARCHON MY ASS.... LET'S RENAME IT TO DRAGON QUEST** 

**the lore powercreep is getting out of hand at this point.** I can't wait to learn at the end of Natlan that there are beings stronger that Dragon Sovereigns and they are returning back to take back the world they borrowed for a while to dragons and Gold is their messenger. And then at the end of Act 6 or 7 we will learn that there is even STRONG entity that's above the ones learned about at the end of Natlan. And people are laughing at WoW writing team after the gutted Warcraft lore

At least Honkai Impact 3 had not such shit and Hercherrs were a thing until the end or Arc1
    based on leaks i was upset that furina was turned into a normal human with no archon-ness but after playing it i think its good. she doesnt want to be an archon, she deserves a normal life after all that. sure she couldve kept her divine body to be special but any ending with her staying as the archon wouldve been weird

its the issue where people want subverted expectations and the archon quest formula to be changed, but when it happens people are mad that the archon is no longer an archon.

also is it a retcon? i was under the impression destroying the hydro throne also affected and basically broke the gnosis, which is why neuvillette was so fine with giving it away
        Okay, let‚Äôs subvert tropes. Next time a male exists to elevate a female in this story
Insane quest. It's a huge step above everything we had previously. It had a lot of weight to it and was really well paced. I felt like watching one of my favorite anime when doing it, really enjoyed it
Furina was more archon than some other archons, despite being human and not holding any authority. Best girl period.
Strongest and Best Written Character in the game, Furina.
I see a lot of people talking about the suffering Furina faced, but I don't see enough appreciation for the flip side: she didn't break even in the face of such misery.

She shoved her hand into primordial water *fully ready to die* just for some slim chance of keeping up the charade, and only didn't die because the protagonists made some on-second-thought precautions.

Then, when given the chance (at least, in her internal world) to finally confide in someone and soothe her misery, but with some chance that it ruins everything, she *refuses*: "I am Furina, the Archon of Fontaine!"

Furina suffers and struggles with herself, sure, but she's also metal as fuck.
It‚Äôs the best quest in the whol game I love it so much none of the archon quests compare to this one imo!! Focalors death cutscene was the best in the entire game imo. Neuv regaining his power was so cool! Everything was so good! This aq made me love Furina!

The whale fight is kinda boring tho. If you don‚Äôt end up killing it once it‚Äôs knocked out it‚Äôs sooo boring
I knew the Archon Quest was gonna hit hard when they started off by killing Melus and Silver üò≠ I only knew these two for only 2 quests prior, but they already stole my heart. When Navia revealed they got dissolved, I was so devasted!!! Honestly gigachad NPCs and I will miss them, Silver especially waaahhgg

And then the story just kept! on! going! Thr feels train didnt stop chugging and the lore bombs didnt stop dropping. I'm still processing everything that happened and was revelaed LIKE HOLY CRAP HOYO COOKED THIS ARCHON QUEST SO GOOD! WELL DONE üëèüëèüëè
I know we say this everytime a new AQ is released, but this was honestly THE BEST AQ in Genshin. I absolutely loved Sumeru's and it had it's "holy shit" parts, but this quest was hype throughout. The amount of story they fit into a single quest without it seeming like too much or clustered is amazing.

These are the moments that make me remember why I love this game and it's story
I have a few doubts regarding the quest So is neuvillette the Hydro Archon now or Fontaine is Archon less now ?
    Fontaine is Archon less now
I genuinely loved this Archon quest and it outside of the Sumeru questline was the only other one to truly make me cry. Seeing Furina have to play a part in Focalor's plan for 500 years would break anyone after a while. To see her meet the descendant of the one woman from 20 generations ago and seeing Focalor's last message to Furina made me straight-up cry. 

I just wonder where they go from here with the next update and also what will be happening now since the main quest for Fontaine is done.
THEY FUCKING COOKED. This was the main AQ, the main course. All before that was just a prelude and a set-up. It was *perfect*. I do not really have complaints about it
Out of everyone who could meet in future event. I really want Furina to meet any of the archon. For them to tell her they she, even though a fake God, is a  great archon.
I admittedly didn't like Furina at the start of the AQ quest. While she still isn't one of my favorites she isn't a character I hate anymore. Still haven't done her story quest yet so I don't know if anything in it will further change my opinion of her.

Edit: LMAO got downvoted for saying I don't hate her anymore. I'm sorry she ain't one of my faves.
It's excellent, possibly the best one we've had so far.
Tho i don't see a lot of people talking about what this quest means for the future of the story. One of the dragon sovereigns has regained his full dragonhood and plans on judging celestia and the other archons. This will probably have huge ramifications in the future. 
Also i might've understood it wrong but Focalor's plan was to destroy one of the thrones of heaven, and destroying the role of hydro archon. I don't think celestia will love this.
We don't know what is gonna happen in natlan or sneznahya, but i'm fairly sure thaf when we finally get to strike back at celestia, it will take place in fontaine (heck maybe we'll get there with wriothesley's boat)
So... is neuvillette the new archon now and replace furina in all the art works that features archons in it?
    He is not the archon. The place of the archon is now gone. Focalors will remain as the last Hydro archon.
    for Hoyoverse marketing purposes no, in story according to people of Fontaine yes
I think as to the hated part,

It seems to me like even though she has retired from her role as "being an archon" the rest of society still is 50/50 on her, where one part still loves and adore her for her role as the archon, and the other half seem to hate her for being negligent to their catastrophe as an archon
Fontaine makes Sumeru's archon quest feel all bright and happy and I literally sobbed in the scene between Nahida and Rukkhadevata. 

The fact is: Nahida had friends and was happy in the end. While Furina remained alone, with no one to comfort her...

I am still hoping she gets some well-deserved hugs during her story quest.
Best Archon quest by quite a long way, Loved Furina my new favourite character I think.

Downside is the conflicting quests in Genshin are unreal, it's insane how bad the user experience is if you don't tidy up all the quests as soon as they are released.

Still AQ quest was top notch.
Now I feel so bad laughing at how she pales in comparison to Nahida's capability to negotiate with harbingers. She may have lived long but it just wasn't fair comparing a normal human with the god of wisdom.
    Nahida at the very least could use her Archon powers (dreamwalking etc.), Furina on the other hand was completely powerless.
Omg you're right üò≠ Back then the scene was kinda funny to me but act V recontextualizes that scene and now I feel traumatized for Furina. Get the girl a therapist istg. Girl needs a psychological debriefing ASAP
    Would be nice if she had interactions with Nahida one day
        Furina is trapped into her role as an archon, Nahida was trapped because she did not "fit" her role as an archon.

Are there divine beings therapists in Teyvat?
            That's the job of the Traveller. üòÖ
                They give therapy sessions to intercelstial beings in exchange for only a couple of sentences worth lead on their sibling. What a chad.
            Venti?
                Venti is a drunkard, like literally drinking his "traumas" away, we don't need baby Furina and Nahida following in his footsteps
        Oohh they would be best friends. Furina would go well as Wanderer's sister.
        Honestly furina is one of the few archons that are not really tied to their nation like nahida and ei so im hoping they give this girl all the screentime
Man...now that you mentioned it...oof...
Furina went from girlfailure to girlboss that I want to protect
    From "must correct üò≠üí¢" to "must protect üò§üõ°Ô∏è"
Bro I'm so mad that we didn't get to comfort her somewhere at the end of the quest, the least she deserves is a hug and I was yelling for it every time the Traveler got anywhere close to her

Hoyo please let me hug the poor little water gremlin ;_;
    Wished the people at the end would at least thank her after the flood and she would kneel down finally feeling relieved and cry everything out.
        That's the thing, no one knows. Only Neuvillete and the Traveler really know what she went through. For the people of Fontaine, Furina just stepped down, not dying because Neuvillete took pity on her.
The worst part is - she was not crying afterwards because she was scared of being attacked. She was scared she failed her mission to protect her people.
I just can‚Äôt stop feeling sad for her. Girl was immortal for last 500 years and now she‚Äôs gonna age and die like an ordinary human. The rest of her life will feel like the blink of an eye :(
Also wish she would have told Neuv that she was targeted, he would have dealt with Arlecchino
That's what's good with this storyline ultimately, you can do it a second time, and it will sound totally differently
That scene was such a gut punch. The fact that Furina essentially had to proactively do nothing for 500 years and couldn‚Äôt open up to anyone about it, anyone would start to crack at that point
    That was some genuine cosmic horror shit.

I hope Furina now moves to Mondstat or Liyue and lives a nice peaceful live.
        Fuck it, give her a permanent residence in the teapot. Make it canon.
            No. She's been trapped long enough. Let her live her life for once
                Vacation home in the teapot
        I have no mouth, but I must scream
She is almost break when the one she met after being Archon was 20 generations ago, and her tears of loneliness was praise as ‚Äúbeautiful display of power‚Äù is hard to bear.

 Even when MC inside her mind, they couldn‚Äôt break the her character. Even touching primordial sea would kill her, wouldn‚Äôt stop her from risking her life just to buy more time. Only break down when her role had ended and then neither death sentence or primordial sea could fear her no more. 

Truly willpower could rivals gods.
Absolutely marvelous. I'm finally glad that Furina's story does her justice in the eyes of the playerbase.

She went through so much. I hope she heals.
    Pre-release there were a lot of people who didn‚Äôt like it after reading the leaks, which I didn‚Äôt understand because I thought this story was great. Glad to see that the majority of people like it.
That scene is genuinely fucked up.  And I mean that in the best way possible -- while you can disturb players in so many direct, "easy" ways, disturbing players in this more intelligent way like this can be so damn hard.  But it worked, and it's truly unsettling.

Poor, poor Furina.
That was the best scene in my opinion. The tears while putting on a fake smile was one of the best portrayals of the burden she bears. It took the quest from 10/10 to 13/10
I am kinda mad the Archon Quest had no interaction with Furina in the end.
    She‚Äôs like a bicycle

 She‚Äôs too tired
        Cyno please
        Cyno, this isn't the right time

*screenshots the joke*
    Well maybe we will get some answers on her character quest
    play characters quest, its really good, different side of her
    This is my criticism towards the archon quest
    The entire thing was major character development for her and it absolutely is in my top 5 character quests. She said enough as it was happening.
    This is my only real gripe with it. It gave great closure on Focalors, but Furina not so much. As far as I understand it everyone in Fontaine still only think she deceived them for her own gain right? Or at least, they don't know the sacrifice she has made
    I think they used her story quest to approach that .
        Sadly her story quest turned into typical genshin quest for the most part with some really good Furina moments. Those moments are good enough to like it but I wish it focused some more on the effects of the AQ on Furina. Here's hoping for a banger 2nd story quest
            I liked the quest, surely its not the neuvillette story quest but i think it fits her current state, now that she is human she lives more normal things and can be more free on her decicions.

But i wonder if she or neuvillette would be recieving a second story for the next weekly boss.
                I do appreciate exploring her human side but going straight to the story quest after the aq was a huge jump from Furina breaking down and then watching as her nation gets flooded but actually things are fine straight to Furina already breaking her rule about not doing performance arts and being fairly light hearted.

Sure, this could be a testament to her strong will but I just wish her SQ1 expanded more on her moving out, maybe having Traveler apologize for tricking her, and even maybe letting Furina confide in them and letting it all out. It would be p cool for the current sq1 to actually have been her sq2 to signal her growth and ability to move on perhaps.

Still, it was a good sq with a banger song at the end and the whole thing serves to even further show Furina's iron will due to how quickly she got back on her feet after something so traumatizing. I'm just pondering.
load bad primal water with religious intent
Bro, when she cried and went to bed, I was so fuking shocked at that moment, and just praying for her
    That was crazily dark for Genshin. Usually they save the really dark stuff for the world quests, but the fact that a main character went through that tormet is rough.
        I am done with her story quest, and I'm quite happy to see her doing fine as a human being, also the moment she got her vision made me happy too, but now I have this doubt about how she got the vision(maybe she is too ambitious about acting )
            Hydro visions are for people that fill a role they believe in even if its not who they really are. Out a principle or belief its the right thing to do. Its less ambition and more a sense of duty. I wanna say her getting the vision right then was because she made the decision to step up even if its painful to herself.
                You're right, She also mentioned this in her voice line 'about the vision'.
            I havent played that quest yet and will only be able to tomorrow, can u tell me if her quest is set after or before act 5?
                It is set after act 5!
Neuvillette gives you the power of Pneumia at that point in the fight, all you had to do was hit the orb once and it should've shattered. Did it with no Fontaine characters in my party.

For the weekly version you'll need an actual Fontaine character, although the fight is easy without any
    Yeah raiden nahida, Kuki still kill him without much of a issue
That number is almost equivalent to ~500 years as well. So fkn smart to show the passage of time that way
    i think it wouldve been nice if we got some scenes inbetween, like an act 10~ years in, one 50 years in, etc. show her coming to terms with this shit taking a normal humans lifespan in length
        I think they did that pretty effectively via the subjects she was meeting all being from the same bloodline (talking about how her grandma 20 generations back idolized her)
            yeah i get that, but im more meaning about seeing her reaction to the length of time. we see her reactions to the first week, then jump to 500 years. wouldve been great to see her in her room 10 years later realizing "holy fuck"
                It just meant that it took 500 years to finally make her breakdown which shows her willpower. She was even smiling while tears flowing from her even making excuses.
I didn't have one as well, but didn't Neuvilette give us a part of his power to deal with that? Because if i'm not becoming schizo, i'm fairly sure my Faruzan was doing Pneumia reactions... Or was it Ousia? Don't know the difference after 12 weeks lmao.
    Neuv literally skipped most of the fight for us.
    Id rather have him appear as a trial character. It was too hard to make out, with a lot going on screen already.
i just didnt like how the second phase has no lore at all, no descriptions (afaik) and no characters mentioning it. why the fuck is there a knight inside the whale, in an area that resembles the sustainers cubes?
>The only thing I did not enjoy was the second phase of the whale

I was so confused when it just. Well ended
man it says something about the archon quest when the boss fight was the most oddly anticlimactic part of it. Which I'm phrasing as a good thing--there was just so much good juicy stuff in the archon quest that I keep forgetting we fought a whale at some point.
https://i.imgur.com/odGngE8.mp4

clip i got of the scene because of how much it made me laugh. skirk dusting her hands afterwards is so fucking funny
    May you get c6 for any character you wish in a 10 pull. That was beautiful
I love how he‚Äôs perfectly straight

Man makes for a better arrow than an archer
    new childe bow just dropped
        holy celestia
It was funny then Skirk just casually starts dusting her hands off like that was the most simple task ever which added to it perfectly

Like woman please Childe has been fighting that whale for days on end and we still struggled vs it with a full power Neuvillette you could at least treat Childe with some semblance of care, truly a ruthless teacher I love it lmao

Then again same JP VA as Scathach so not surprised she treats her disciples like that lol
    Reminder that Childe's goal was to get his master to fight him using both hands finally. The fact that Skirk yeeted him with just one hand still is kind of brutal
    Childe was having the time of his life fighting that giant Narwhal, his whole thing is fighting strong opponents and he got the chance to square the fuck up to an ancient cosmic all devouring entity, Skirk is just gently tossing her disciple into bed to rest, she's so nice to him.
        Gently huh
Me! It was even funny when Skirk trashtalked him lmao
    Was it really trash talking him though? She said she doesnt talk to weak people which is why she didnt sat much to childe sure, but that was reffering to him when he was a a kid/teen.
    he wasnt worth her trashtalking to kekl
Yeet the Childe.
    I‚Äôm calling the Childe Protection Service!
And dusting her hand after that.
>We already know the Heavenly Principles is the first descender

I missed some stuff or can't remember this. can you explain? There's way too much to this Genshin lore stuff.
    It's not confirmed, but nahida assumes it 

[skip to 2:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_DAoV-NWU)
        Also the Abyss is the Second Who Came, which would have to make Celestia the first.
            The abyssal realm has always existed in Teyvat.

The dragons were the light realm and the abyss was the void realm.
        I'm going to have to revisit that conversation
    Wouldn't the primordial one aka the first who came be the first descender? Unless Heavenly principle and primordial one is same person.
Also would suggest that the Traveler is indeed like a magnet for trouble, just like Paimon mentioned at the very start of the Fontaine Archon Quests before we left Sumeru. XD
also if a 2nd Archon War had occurred or anyone tried to invade Fontaine, she would have been powerless and the ruse would have been completely blown
    I'm guessing that Focalors was counting on Celestia to prevent or intervene in the case of all-out war between the nations. That or how technically advanced Fontaine is in comparison to other nations aside from Snehznya, would've scared off other countries that didn't know Furina was quite powerless
        current day Fontaine is indeed quite strong but in the early days (100 years into the 500 year plan for example) we don't know how powerful Fontaine was. A rogue evil god like Osial or his wife could have tried to conquer Fontaine (just using an example) and well...
            True, also I can't imagine how stressed the fuck out Furina would be if an Osial showed up lmao, she'd go insane
She didn't have much choice. If she didn't do what she did the prophecy would've killed every Fontainian regardless and she would still be left alone on the throne crying.

I don't think she started the plan with full confidence it would work 100%, and compared with Neuv not feeling empathy, Furina's human mind breaking midway is a much more likely reason for failure.
Before: Furina is an irresponsible god who may or may not have done anything while her nation is on the brink of doom



After: Furina hasn't done anything wrong. She's played her part spectacularly and to the best of her abilities. She has truly done her best and really tried her best. She deserves all the headpats, hugs and sweets in the world. She deserves to rest, enjoy life and know how much of a good girl she's been.
    Yeah I really love how it recontextualizes everything, at first you think she‚Äôs just a funny girlfailure but then you realize she might just be the most dedicated Archon yet.
    And The fcking traveler and Paimon taking audacity to comfort her in story quest after Aether destroyed and humiliated her in Archon quest
        Tbf The Traveler was only doing what he thought was right at the time. He never would‚Äôve humiliated Furina if he knew the full story. Given the facts he had, it‚Äôs a reasonable conclusion that he wanted to stop a poser from giving people false hope
        This is so true, they don't deserve to do that, what they needed is to apologize sincerely since it's what Furina deserved. The nerve lmao
        Yes. Seriously noted that for complain
The fact that this quest and monstadt's quest are in the same game is crazy. The quality has really skyrocketed since sumeru imo.
    I imagine that Inazuma could have been on the quality of those two if it wasn‚Äôt rushed.

The whole Furina/Focalors plot felt like a more fleshed out version of Raiden/Ei.
        The whole Watatsumi island and Raiden's dimension should've been 2 different acts.
        Inazuma actually had great themes and ideas, but it was paced really badly, probably due to COVID development or something.
            Yes. Inazuma makes me so mad because there was so much potential there. It had the chance to be something amazing.
        Even Neuvillete's thoughts about his belonging in this world where quite similar to the ones Ganyu has, but the execution and depth to them is miles away. Their storytelling has improve SO MUCH.
        This is so real, Inazuma was awesome to me as a regi√≥n but if only its story couldve been delivered as well as sumerus or fontaines It wouldve been the second BEST (cuz It wouldnt top fontaine for me tbh)
    This is prob why Venti hasn't had his chara story.
>Best Archon for me 

In general terms, I still think Nahida is the best one and quite hard to top, but, as someone that really don't like Furina's personality, she played her role AMAZINGLY, I'm still quite not being a fan of her but the development and passing in the story was quite interesting and they allow us to know what's behind her, not to now say "look, she is great now, no more failure" but to understand whats going on and tell us the story of Fontaine.

Her interactions with Neuvillete have been the best ones and have no comparison with the rest of the regions. For me, Neuvillete is the best writed character in the game right now, having a playable primordial dragon was the best decision ever, that allow us to have a more responsable approach to things but also carry on with Focalors plan and Furina's show.

Also... Love that everything wasn't center on her, but in a profecy that affects all the region, allowing us to know more about it, to care about the region, they used their cast as NEVER before, but also, bring back Childe to develop him even more, the appearence of Mona, short but pretty useful and a nice touch.

Quite impressive in general, maybe not the best archon for me, but definetly this region has the best story arc until now and make me enjoy the game again so much, never has been so excited since I went into Beidou's ship to go to Inazuma.
Venti‚Äôs charm = lots of wine üòÇ‚ú®‚ù§Ô∏è
her character quest is so wholesome, feel fresh see different side of her
The silent sacrifice she made and kept for so long was really powerful to see. Even at her greatest moment of weakness and vulnerability, she did not relent. Mad props to her
Honestly Melus and Silver are Teppei done right. My heart sunk when we met Navia and they weren't around, and I got teary eyed and almost cried at the grave scene. I loved them in all their appearances and seeing them leave hurts so much.
    Teppei crawled so Dunyarzad could run and live and so Melus and Silver could be an NPC sacrifice done well. Honestly even after being dissolved they still were devoted to keeping her alive, it got me good best subordinates
    Melus literally sounded like my grandpa when he would read stories out loud to me in a "David Attenborough" voice and it made me SOB
Yeah I love that it gave more information on Gnoses and descenders at the end much like the end of Sumeru's!

I must say tho, the narwhal seemed too out of place for me. Like it doesn't belong in the same story. An intergalactic space monster being the cause of the primordial sea water rising feels out of place to me in terms of the story so far. Like it's fine for me if the seawater rising is because of the prophecy just happening without having a specific cause. But the specific cause they gave just took me out of it. Space whale is too out there for me personally especially since I expected the prophecy to be all Celestia/Heavenly Principles. Skirk also came out of nowhere, literally. Anyhow, it was still an visually appealing weekly boss and Skirk gave a few lore crumbs so I guess I'm fine with it.
    my only issue is that the whale is a pet. not only does that mean we have some absurd powerscaling of someone taming it, but the entire doomsday prophecy being due to the whims of some strong dude wanting to feed his space whale is odd
        That's been there since the beginning. Skirk likened her master to the alchemist Gold, and Gold was responsible for the cataclysm where multiple archons died
            genuinely fair point, i guess it just feels different reading about ancient lore of a powerful alchemist, versus skirk nonchalantly being like "lol yeah he was feeding his pet whale"
    Genshin Impact is a part of larger universe so that didn't bother me much. It's a reminder that there are far more dangerous things lurking outside of Teyvat.
        I mean I know that. Traveler is basically like an amnesic space hero. It's just that in the context of the whole Fontaine arc which is more focused on solving mysteries in prisons, the opera, and the city, trying to save people from a prophesied flood, the sudden appearance of an intergalactic space monster seems out of place. Not to mention that Fontaine is mecha/steampunk-esque in design and atmosphere so I didn't expect the interdimensional narwhal tbh. They did tease the whale last patch so maybe it's just me ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Still love Act V as a whole tho üíú
            I thought it fits the whole fate theme, child Childe being the accidental trigger but later also being necessary to hold the whale off for a few weeks to finish the prophecy with the trial. And all the pieces that needed to perfectly fit for Focalor plans to work out. It also adds a whole layer of more mystery to Albedos master (she has too many names), it certainly takes powers out of this world to do what she supposedly did. If you think about it, a lot of the most impactful influence in Teyvat came from outside - the descenders being in the centre of everything. Anyways, sorry for the tangent. In my mind the space whale fits right in.
    i just realized feels like the primodordial whale is the equivalent of neuvilette as a leviathan/whale in draconic form. so maybe it's like primordial whale vs dragon whale
And many Players had Questions why Melus and silver weren't included in the recent Furina Trailer.... Now we have the answer...I am still sad
>especially in regards to the gnosis leave me intrigued

Every time another Gnosis ends up in the hands of the Fatui, I groan. At least Neuvillette gave a good reasoning for willingly handing over the Gnosis but man- Tevat is mega-fucked if the Fatui get all seven Gnoses, and I don't even know what their master plan is! But knowing what they did with the electro Gnosis and having it give that amount of power to Scaramouche, I bet it's gonna be some epic archon-topping, reality-shattering, completely broken in every way god-related super device of some sort.
    If I had to guess, maybe they plan to ressurect the third descender and return power to the dragons in order to overthrow Celestia?
        Oh. My. God. 

The resurrecting the third descender part is possible and would be amazing.
            That would be so cool. Collect all the pieces and the third descender lives again
        Third Descender, aka Exodia
        How about waiting for the 4th descender to collect all 7 elements and then kill it. Having ang Omni element Gnosis is crack. Hahah
        im sure others have mentioned it before but act 5 is called "Incandescent Ode of Resurrection" maybe not the dragon stuff because that seems harder but the first part kinda checks out because they would have all the gnosis at the end of the next act right.
    Arlecchino basically all but confirming that Fatui plans revolve around the world as a whole. Can only wonder how the Gnosis all come into play, especially as Skirk describing them as misfortune

The fact the lore drops that they are remains of the third descender in on itself is such a big revelation. Can only wonder what the Fatui plan on doing with them and whether it will work considering they apparently bring misfortune
        I mean, hard to say how exactly they will be used, but presumably they're planning to use their power in some way to overthrow Celestia.
        Yeah , now with many AQs until today, now I think about It, that the fatui and harbingers May Not be that evil after all ( with some exceptions) 
But the abyss Organization is still kinda evil
        >as misfortune

Given the context of their little chat, it felt a bit like a threat to me. Like "Oh you have so much money in your hand, would really be a pity if I had to kill you to get it."
    they already have six of the seven gnosis (one stolen, four peacefully exchanged, and one from the tsaritsa herself). the last one is in natlan, which just so happens to be in the nation of *war*. i foresee a huge war coming fighting over the last gnosis (just like how in infinity war the last infinity stone was obtained after a huge battle)
    I had the same exact reaction. BUT, I thought about it and realized the fatui are probably on the same side as the traveler, getting back at/killing the heavenly principles. Pretty sure they are either going to use the gnoses power or resurrect the 3rd descender.
    Why are you so sure that Teyvat is fucked if they get all the gnoses? To me it seems like the Tsaritsa‚Äôs plan is to go to war with the Heavenly Principles, which means we could be on the same side after all.
    It was the most successful Fatui operation to date. They saved lives in  Fontaine. They established good relations with court of Fontaine and Spina de Rosula. And they got a gnosis of the hydro archon in a trade/reward for their efforts. Unlike the rest of the nations they‚Äôre not persona non grata with Fontaine for now.
    Don't say what "they" did to Electro Gnosis. It was only Dottore
Gotta bum rush it to avoid Youtubers puting fkn spoilers in their video titles. This is the only way. 

Worth it.
    This. I stayed up to finish it so I wouldn't be spoiled. Absolutely worth it.
        Same. Had to stay home from school cause I was too tired to drive in the morning. It feels irresponsible to say, but it was absolutely worth it. But fuck it, it's like missing a day of school to see a midnight release Endgame or the final Harry Potter or something.
        Yeah I went to bed at 1 am on a work night just so I could finish it. Worth it
        Agreed. No regrets at all.
    Literally yes. The spoilers run rampant everywhere
        6am rn I haven't had a wink of sleep, I am so glad I held off on spoilers to witness this quest. Peak writing
            Same haven't finish the archon and character quest until 6 am. Had no sleep. Worth it.
    Oh god if this isn't me but with fear of reddit spoilers. I just got on reddit after finishing the very long AQ (I think I was playing for 4 hrs straight üíÄ) but it was worth it! Will do the story quest tomorrow so y'all can't spoil me anymore üòÇ
    Use youtube block extension.
    This. Is imposible just to see youtube, tik tok, twitter, etc
It's about five hours long without skipping any dialogue at all
I clocked in at about four and a half
I was awake an hour before maintenance finished and I've been waiting for this update for so long lol üò≠
It released at 3pm for me, easily the first thing imma do as ive been looking forward to it since 4.1 AQ ended
Some madman completed the AQ in an hour and released cutscenes on Youtube.

Guess it‚Äôs all about the views.
It‚Äôs relatively short. Only 1 act. Took about 3-4 hrs.
    Wym relatively short? It was roughly 4 hours. Fitting for an act v
        I meant compared to previous patches where we had 2 acts. Hence the reason why I said ‚Äúonly 1 act.‚Äù
            Valid I guess. It took me roughly the same about of time to finish this one act vs the two in the last patch so I based my judgement off that
I called it sick for this.
Ikr i got on once update came and i got distracted exploring that i forgot to do aq.
I stayed up past 2am and STILL didn't finish it. I knew I didn't have time to play it today and now I'm suffering with sleep deprivation.
Presumably invisible walls on the border
    "How about we explore the area ahead of us later?"
    ‚ÄúSuck to be them‚Äù
It‚Äôs probably just Fontiane sinking instead of the water levels rising.
"What happens in Teyvat stays in Teyvat" - The Heavenly Principles ^(probably)
Probably a localized Event
Disappeared among the sea ~~of butterflies~~
    ILLUSIONS OF THE ASS
Have you forgotten the steep desert cliffs you have to climb/jump down to reach Fountaine? And its easy to forget the nation is literally bordered by waterfalls.

Basically, the nation's topography keeps such a flood more localized then you think.
    Yea but the whole nation is higher than whole region of Mondstad, I haven't seen how the land between those 2 nation's looks from new region, but even then, water from Fontaine flows all the way to liyue, which means everything there would be flooded too. Also the water level was high enough to sink the city of Fontaine and I think it rose higher than dragonspine peak, it had to be magically contained somehow
The guilty verdict was on Fontaine alone, idk why it's surprising the flood didn't affect other nations
Skirk mentioned how the flood is from the excess hydro energy. I imagine the flood comes from Fountaine within and goes outwards. So basically the water erupted like boiling water and then spills outwards and drains in like Sumeru or something.

That would explain how it receded so fast.
We get her personal character quest in any case c:
It was the first time I actually ugly cried instead of only shedding some tears lol
    I just did Furina‚Äôs Story Quest and ugly cried, AGAIN. THIS IS THE FOURTH TIME FOR THE DAY.. üò≠üò≠
        SOBBING WEEPING RN
Have to admit that I lost it when >!Focalors recites the "Hydro Dragon, Hydro Dragon, Don't Cry" line.  It really hits home for everyone who already played his character quest.  Right before she said it, I said it myself imagining it'd be the perfect line there, and sure enough.  Absolutely brilliant way to bring that back.!<
    I sort figured the line would show up in their conversation, but it still got me in the feels when she said it
    And then Furina also say that line to him in the future event.
Him and Furina. No wonder they're Hydro. Also don't forget Egeria, her corpse is still being used to cleanse the Abyss, I hope we have a focus on her a bit more in the future. >!I feel creeped out by what's happening to the gods recently, it's body horror  when you imagine what happened to the third Descender and it's kinda hinting at what their plans with Traveler!< Only Elynas seems to have the best experience dying, it gets to have cute Melusines born from it and he absolutely loves them, his body is just turned to stone too and he could hypothetically revive.
    Third descender could be your real sibling.
        Honestly I thought that too like maybe they counted it as our sibling getting into Teyvat first and then us which is 2 simultaneous Descenders at the same time but then I remembered, we came there just 500 years ago, the Archon wars, especially the fight between the Dragons, 1st and 2nd descender happened for who knows how long ago that it's inconceivable for our twin to be dismembered for it because the Archons already existed 2000+ years ago when the original Seven were seated, unless the Heavenly Principle did some wonky timeline shenanigans where she sent our sibling to the past to be put on the chopping block and then us in the future as some sort of spare or whatever (Paimon being sent as a tracker and sticking her to us) and then it becomes some sort of loop, I dunno
        I thought our sibling belonged to this world so they couldn‚Äôt be the descender? Am I wrong?
            You're thinking of the Abyss Sibling. They are a part of this world, and because of that, they can't be our real sibling, but likely a clone with the same memories.
My first thought was>! ‚ÄúOh *boy* he sounds pissed at the Heavenly Principles for what they caused Focalors/Furina to have to do‚Äù!<
    Every time the story progresses, we see more and more "skeletons in Celestia's closet"
    >!I mean Focalor indirectly told him to judge them for her. I'm sure he's thinking him judging them is the justice both Furina and Focalor deserve.!<
        Finishing the AQ also >!unlocks the "about the Archons" voice lines where he also confirms this. Every one of them is about judging them and their authority as God's. He does feel bad for Buer being neglected though, a nice note!<
Fontaine was such a breath of fresh air. I loved seeing the usual Genshin fantasy elements but in a more ‚Äòmodern‚Äô society.
I really agree with your points! The quest was good but I think there are too many questions around what happend to Childe for me to be satisfied.
    Exactly. I hope we get some kind of follow-up
It was also pretty clear with Shirk that hoyo will push Genshin to a multiverse thing (At least in my opinion). I don't trust Hoyo for those things, people praise Honkai but it's a story mess in my personal opinion. The fact that they handled Childe, Shirk and the whale so bad here kinda enforces my fears for the future. Also, I had a feeling over all the story quest that the gnosis should have been destroyed. In the end, we just got a really fast conclusion about Childe, Shirk and others. Also, I enjoyed Forcalors story but I cannot stop thinking that was also cheap in the conception. Way to many similarities with Raiden/Ei, Nahida/Rukkhadevata, but the way that they handled it was way better. Hope that they don't pull that card again in Natlan and focus more in the dragons (The land of war and dragons in the words of Neuvilette)
Entering the second immediately with that music and the whale scream/sound was awesome, I fully agree. But also the first phase's orchestra is just absolutely insane
    I second that. Genshin's score/soundtrack is quickly rivalling that of the Halo series- at least in my heart.
Dude I thought the exact same, the narwhal music absolutely slapssss, need to wait for someone on YouTube to release a loop to study to üòÇ
    I'm sure people are going to make gamerips of it. I might do the same, actually.
i like how when the narwhal attacks the court in the cutscene, it plays a remix of tartaglias boss theme
    And when Childe shows up, his version of the harbinger theme completely takes over the track.
I think anything abyss related has different feel of the music. Like Before the Light Fades for Marana's Avatar
    I haven't gotten THAT far in the Aranara world quest. I'm still quite far from what I perceive to be the end of it.
        I see. The Withering music in Sumeru is some of my favourites musics in the game
            The Withering theme is pretty darn good.
    Before the Light Fades is such a great track, I love how it‚Äôs almost completely antithetical to the rest of Sumeru‚Äôs sound track, really gives the feeling that this is something foreign and hostile
I wouldnt *trust anyone* who didn't love Furina more after that Act
I‚Äôm usually a big crier and this game hasn‚Äôt gotten anything out of me at all‚Ä¶ until Focalor told Neuvilette not to cry. Pretty much lost it in that scene. Huge, amazing, spectacular kudos to the voice actors who absolutely sold that moment!
    I lost it the moment Furina involuntarily started shedding tears during her talk the the woman. It's such a relatable and hard-hitting scene for 'putting a brave face' type of people.
        ‚ÄúSuch display of Archon power‚Äù
No. Actually prophecy actually come true, as Furina weeping alone on her throne while everything around sink. 

 What Focalos did is killed herself and the Throne, give power back to Neu, and he use power to turn people into real human, thus primordial sea affect them no more.
Does this mean we should start calling them "The Six" now!?! 

Also, if the Heavenly Principles *might* have woken up from what Nahida threatened to do (destroy a gnosis)... SURELY THEY'RE AWAKE NOW FROM THE DESTRUCTION OF A THRONE OF THE SEVEN AND A RESTORATION OF A SOVEREIGN'S AUTHORITY?!?!?

God this quest was amazing
    How will Hoyo insert the Celestia waking up between Natlan and Snezhnaya, something I‚Äôm excited about
So glad they followed through with the death, and they did so in such a spectacular way. It raised the stakes of the story as a whole and was so satisfying. Gotta go watch that cutscene again ...
>a way to show his original strength actually slowly returning

I don't think that's happening though. Skirk mentions the narwhal was defeated without any strength from beyond the planet, indicating the Traveler still doesn't have any of their original power and only relies on Teyvat's elemental powers.
    Nah she means they defeated without relying on the abyss powers, because she uses it
Yeah, I wish that they give Traveller more awesome moments of using their powers
So true. This is what really pisses me off about the devs. They can make all these quests that show off the capabilities of the playable characters but they can't even show the Traveler utilizing all of the elements they have? Like they did it once during Childe's fight and that's it. Fuck off, man. Who's really the protagonist here?
We probably still gonna be seeing a lot of people that still being denial, can't accept the fact that Neuvillette literally the strongest playable character we have.
    Not even about strength, but acting like he‚Äôs the source of all of Furina‚Äôs misery and he‚Äôs the reason she wound up getting depressed, when it‚Äôs painfully obvious he still cares for her. He just sucks at expressing himself.
A lot of people are simply obsessed with the Hydro Archon title more than Furina herself, and drew all their conclusions from leaks so here they are now lol
    It was a good ending for her. That expression she showed at the cutscene after the flood tells everything. That was a look of relief, freedom. That summarizes her good ending although we do not see her directly interacting with others.
    This is fucking true. She fucking hated being an archon god damit let her fucking rest
Jesus isnt the best example since Furina was fully human and had no special powers. Focalors didn't do nothing, she resided in the Oratrice and gathered indemnitium for her eventual execution, while kept an eye on Fontaine through the Oratrice. She did purposely gave Childe a guilty sentence in order to get him to the Narwhal faster in order to keep it at bay at much as possible.
Well, can we even officially call Furina a playable archon? Isn't Neuvilette more archon at this point, than her?

Kinda weird for people building full archon teams. Haha
    She is the recognized Archon, Neiuvilette technically is a Sovereign. Additionally, Archon is simply a title that can be given and taken away, people should not be too hyper focused on that point, personal opinion.

What this quest more so asks the player is what does it truly mean to be an Archon, what defines an Archon? Is it the all power and might, is it the love for the people and nation, is the the support of all their subjects, is it doing what is necessary to protect what is important to them, is it the shoulder the burden and duties of the people and nation etc.

Personally feel this quest is more about the deconstruction of the idea of the so called traditional Archon and stressing the humanity of gods or rather the divinity of humans. Even though Furina does not fit the ideal criteria of the traditional Archon title, she still did what an Archon must for the nation and people, personal opinion.

That goes back to the point of not all stories need to follow the same pattern or arrive at the same conclusion, variety is key especially considering a long running story and ensemble cast (7 Archons, 7 Stories) so certain characters facing different circumstances and challenges are necessary, all characters do not need to have fantasy good endings, sprinkling of misfortune and tragedy is a vital part of good stories.
        If zhongli can retire from being a archon but the community is still calling him one then I don't see why we can't do the same with furina.
            Because he is recognized as an Archon in authority, and we now know from Neuvillette's voice lines that Zhongli still, like all Archons (unconsciously) hands out Visions

&#x200B;

Now, handing out Visions is Neuvillette's job, not Furina's, she has no authority over Hydro

so yeah I wouldn't consider her in the same bracket as Nahida, Raiden, Venti or Zhongli
                >!He's not an Archon. The throne of the hydro archon has been destroyed by Focalor, no one will ever inherit the title of "hydro Archon" ever again. Neuvillette is the hydro sovereign. If you consider him as archon then you should also recognize Apep.!<
                Where is it stated that zhongli still hands out the visions? He doesn‚Äôt even have the gnosis anymore. Id like to know the exact quote
                    Neuvillette Vision story, it explicitly says he hands out Visions now. If the other archons didn't hand them out anymore, it would have been mentioned.

&#x200B;

Even when Raiden didn't have her Gnosis for 500yrs since she gave it to Yae, people (like Fischl) still got electro visions, so logically them not having a Gnosis doesn't matter since the Archons have Authority over elements, and Furina gave her Authority to Neuvillette so he now hands out Visions despite being a Dragon Sovereign and not an Archon. No other Archon handed over Authority, so despite their lack of gnosis, they still give out visions and are archons to me, unlike Furina.

&#x200B;

Neuvillette Vision Story:

&#x200B;

"From that day on, whenever a person's wishes reached the heavens, the seven overseers of the material realm were duty-bound to grant them a gift. Though they might know nothing of who or what wish had stepped into the threshold of the sacred, the Seven Archons still had to impart a shattered shard of their mastery to that person. And when one so gifted completed their duty... the gift the gods would receiving in return would be more abundant still."

"Neuvillette obeys no edict from the heavens, but he does acknowledge human will. So he too set aside parts of himself, as like unto the dragon-treasure hoards of old, awaiting valiant humans to come and claim them."
                        Seems like such an arbitrary metric to judge who the archon is. Moreover, I think you're latching on too much to inference considering we know that the raiden shogun didn't know she was handing out visions either. Whose to say zhongli/venti/raiden/nahida are still doing it? Certainly not that passage, no?

It's just you inferencing that they do it, we don't know that they still do without the gnoses. Furina is one part of focalors, the hydro archon. The game will treat her as the archon for all intents and purposes.

Then I guess, to you, the archon is just no one? because according to that exact same quote you gave it cannot be neuvilette. He doesn't obey the edict from the heavens and does it off his own will.
                they put Furina in the anniversary art this year with the rest of the Archons, maybe just to avoid spoilers but we'll get a real answer next year when they release the next anniversary art if we see Furina or Neuvilette.
        Besides Zhongli himself said that the age of the gods is coming to an end. I think this aq solidified that. As Dainslief said "humans have their humanity" and it was Furina's humanity that saved Fontaine.
            Truly Cooking!!! The point of Archon quests is not to follow some formulaic pattern for each archon but progress the overall world and story progression. This archon quest progressed the weakening of archons powers, hence the end of the age of gods, and the Dain statement as mentioned above.

Also this is setting up to allow room for a new party of players, the Sovereigns to make an impact and entrance later (Natlan) and stir the story further with how Celestia, Sovereigns, Descenders, Archons, Travelers, Fatui and many some other currently unknown characters from beyond etc will connect and interact.
    I suspect Teyvat is pretty rapidly racing towards the abolition of the Archons, anyway. They're Celestia's minions and at this point, it's pretty obvious the Fatui are probably looking to aim their gnoses death laser (or whatever they have planned) upwards. Also, the other Archons didn't seem all that attached to their gnoses, either. Half of them don't act in their positions as gods anymore, either. So what makes them Archons, really?

And considering what Celestia has done to the dragons, I think Neuvillette would be insulted to be called an Archon. He's more like the Liyue Qixing, plus his added responsibility of being a living battery because Fontaine is in the steampunk era.
    If you want to get technical Ei was never actually an archon either
        well, if we go by the theory that every nation has a kind of "throne" for an archon to sit on, Ei would be the successor to Makoto in filling the role.
    Well, I mean Hoyo never promised anyone anything about a supposedly all archon team so... 

Besides, if they wanted, there are already 4 archon archons that can form a team lol
    If you were to call Neuvilette an Archon to his face he might just smash your head off lol.
Yeah I assumed they would bring them back but no they actually stuck with those deaths and honestly I was pleasantly surprised.
    I was thinking of that too when I was about to play the quest
The thing that made me think their deaths are permanent is the scene on the graveyard with all the hero talk. It was too emotional a scene for them to just reverse it. Then the navia "dream sequence" happened and it basically confirmed to me that melus and silver are gone for good. If they resurrected all dissolved people it would cheapen the previous scenes with vacher and navia, and would make the cutscene from last patch less cool since the stakes are actually lower. Glad they stuck with it being permanent. Melus and Silver are heroes ü•≤
I was praying for them to stay dead as fucked up as that sounds lmao, but yeah love how they stuck with it
I was disappointed when I read the leaks and started cursing Hoyo‚Äôs name for doing Furina dirty but doing the quest made me take it back.
    exactly how i felt. i was a little too obsessed (as an archon collector) with her being an archon, but actually playing the quest holy shit she deserves to *not* be an archon. after 500 years she earned her right to be a normal person with a normal life
When she simle with eye covered in eye even if its not cinematic show how she is really broken insed. 
Trully female archon life is suffering before meet us. Also love the symbolism of furina opened her heart with showing her "act all of this time" to the traveler meanwhile focalor in other side explained everything to neuvillete... Focalor literally playing 5D chess with "fate" and celestia..
Neuvilette has answered the question about traveler's sibling in 4.0
I think the Traveler just accepted the only ones who could know about their sibling are Zhongli and Venti
Actually interesting that you mentioned it, coz assuming that our twin did travel all over Teyvat, what mark did they leave in Fontaine? In Sumeru, our twin was there to fight the miasma (?) with the aranaras.
    The twin was also involved with the whole Caribert incident in Sumeru
As far as we know Celestia is inactive at the moment, but with Neuvillette regaining his powers and Focalors deceiving Celestia, perhaps we'll see the consequences in future archon quest interludes? Celestia might be more active in Natlan? Only time will tell.
Same.. I still couldn't get my mind off it.
i was thinking about the quest the entire rest of the night yesterday, went to sleep and am still thinking about it now today. it was phenomenal
Technically, Focalors/Furina was one of the oceanids made human by the previous archon, so Furina is actually human (especially now that Neuv did his thing that now prevents Fontainians to be dissolved anymore), the human half of Focalors that she left behind to fool the Heavenly Principles.
Same feeling. The whale and Skirk just broke the immersion for me. I felt like reading Naruto ending.
My attempt at answers, though I'm not sure if it's all 100% explained anywhere, so some speculation to try to connect the dots.

1. Furina was basically Focalors' face to the world.  Although we saw in the flashback that they spoke through the "mirror," this was basically a stage metaphor and doesn't necessarily mean they literally could only speak to each other via a mirror.  It's quite possible that Focalors was able to guide Furina on what to say in certain cases to help her will play out, as would have been the case with Neuvillette (as she makes clear in her scene with him that she was behind his role).  Obviously there was some classified info she didn't tell, even to Furina, to ensure she could carry out her role.

2. I think we can basically say that Furina is "acting."  The short-haired dark version is the "real human Furina" where as the long-haired light version is how people knew her when she was acting as Focalors.  Symbolically I'd say they are trying to symbolize that Furina is the "extracted" human side of Focalors, so they originally were the same person before the split.  I haven't seen an in-game explanation yet, but perhaps the fact that she can use both Pneuma and Ousia is supposed to suggest that she has kept some of the "aptitude" that allowed her to become archon in the first place.  Perhaps she dons the other "costume" in combat to help her focus her energy in the opposite direction (to act "in character").

3. The game explains it as properties contained in all life in Fontaine, and the collision of these two opposing energies can both cancel each other out and create more energy.  So it's sort of like a fantasy version of matter/antimatter (or energy principles like that) that is inherent to the region of Fontaine and people born there.  Since we now know that all the original Fontaine people were Oceanids transformed into humans using primordial water, and the whole region is suffused with hydro power, we can assume that this all stems back to the water.  So, because of that, as the dragon sovereign with domain over hydro, it makes sense that Neuvillette would now have full control over this as well.
    I don‚Äôt really agree with the 1st one though. One of the biggest struggle/sacrifice of Furina is that she was all alone. She did not have anybody to confide to, didn‚Äôt have anybody who can know her secret, talk to her about it. I don't think Focalors talked to Furina ever since she started playing god.....
        Well, Focalors certainly wasn't going to substitute for a "companion" either way, because she's the one that put her up to this cruel responsibility in the first place.  What Furina was looking for, to be less lonely, was a friend -- someone she could confide her secret to and who could empathize with what she's going through.

I'm not necessarily suggesting they were constantly talking to each other or anything -- perhaps it's been centuries since she did any intervention at all.  But, Focalors was definitely the one who setup Neuvillette's role as part of her plan, so one way or another it was her "will" that was guiding that to happen.  Based on what we know of Furina's personality and the truth behind it all now, I would still tend to believe that somehow that was the voice of Focalors to Neuvillette coming through, and not just part of Furina's act.
Focalors and Furina have the same voice actor. Pretty sure that's Focalors telling him that.
    Focalors in game (in the AQ) talks very differently with a sort of deeper voice than those trailer lines though. Neuvillette also did not look like he ever seen Focalors before when he met her in the AQ. There was no sense of familiarity in the tone. (imo, I could be wrong, but it really felt like this to me.)
perhaps it will all be revealed in the story quest, but i cant say so because i havent done her story quest myself
    None of these gets any answer. I have done the SQ
Same. I want to know how they met, sudden change of character (Focalors and Furina is quite different in character, I think) would give away something off.
she got her vision in her story quest
Nah don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôll defeat Surtalogi like all the other earth-shatteringly strong weekly bosses by collecting some funny coloured orbs and going pew pew üòÇ
    When skirk said she was going to slash 3 millions times i was like "don't worry the traveler will stil whoop your ass if there is an occasion.
The hexenzirkel never "dared" to channenge the Anemo Archon. Form the cutscene "One upon a time, it even challenged the Anemo Archon itself". Whcih doesn't really imply anyhing about their strength. Not to mention Venti is most sus archon, he has like the seconds biggest feat of power of any archon in the Lore lmao after Morax, but somehow is the "weakest".
Haha, didn't expect to find a somewhat matching opinion  regarding the story. 

Though one thing that I may add is how much I hated the fact that this game is already goes on for so long, and yet the heavenly principle never shows up or do anything after that opening cutscene. Focalor literally deceived them and there is no consequences, like whats the point for all being scared or having a quote of "never make enemy of a divine" if there are no real threat regarding them.

Overal super dissappointed for the fact that there are no heavenly principle involvement for this quest, if they added their involvement into the story super duper late, hoyoverse better have a good explaination regarding them or else is kinda dumb to have them eventually lose to the traveler after doing exactly nothing throughout the game
    Yeah, especially since it undermines ageria's entire plan. Like, what's the point of deceiving them if they won't react either way? Unless I'm missing something? 

The lore in this game is great, so I'm sure there's a good reason. But it doesn't change how disappointing it feels right now.
Oh and you are so spot on about paimon, there is no words that can describe how much I hated her by acting like a kid and asking a dumbass question to navia when she is grieving on her father's grave.


The story already goes on so far and she didn't do anything noteworthy of being an actual useful companion, at least make her do something (which actually can also progress the main story plot) or just cut her out of the story when she isn't needed. I mean she is just usually left out anyway if traveler is having a "heavy" conversation with some character
I've made the mistake of starting the trial bit whilst dinner was cooking and boy that bit just goes on forever without a break. Then the slow walking from area to area in her world. 

I'd appreciate the stories a lot more if they didn't make everything so damn long.
Yeah I agree with basically everything.

I had a hard time taking the quest seriously because of how lightheartedly the characters, especially Paimon, were acting/talking.  We're all gonna die and Navia's two closest companions died -> YAY FOOD!

Also I feel like there were a lot of things that seemed important but were just glossed over.  Focalors tells us that her original sin was actually the original justice.  Okay but why?  Because if you don't explain it's literally just "because we wanted it it's justice" which doesn't make much sense.

Overall, Fontaine went from my favorite (Act 1-2) to mid/least favorite (Act 3,5).
I think people aren't critical enough of these game's stories, I really think they need to cut out 40% of the writing especially when it's not an interesting way of showing what's going on. Short and sweet would make it better. Just cut the filler and put efforts elsewhere.
I thought her "disappearing" from the narrative there was thematically consistent for many reasons, honestly.  The role she'd been made to play for so many long years was finally over, and without her "role" she's got no part on the stage anymore.  It's absolutely tragic for her character at that point in time, because her whole character is tragic... but Focalors' gambit was to abdicate her power to begin with, and that also "frees" Furina.  This is why her character quest is >!all about processing what happened and learning to rebuild -- despite trauma, to step on the stage again and being recognized for it!<.

I mean, to me, the most tragic part was that the one time she had the glimmer of maybe being able to open up to someone, we stabbed her in the back.  They sort of absolved us of some guilt for that later by suggesting that, in the end, she wouldn't have "faltered" after all, but yeah.  That the whole trial was actually us playing directly into the hands of fate all along is a particularly cruel trick, but was again thematically consistent with what was foreshadowed.

In the end, although the story was "cruel" to Furina in many ways, I think it's a very powerful place for her character to rebuild from -- to really rediscover what it means to live as human from here on out.  As you say, her life will improve from here now that she can truly be herself.
    She stuck her hand into the water from the primordial sea she was ready to end it all my heart
        Or hope to pull it off and prolong the character as long as she can, even risking her life for it.
    I've only just started her character quest and i'm excited to see where it goes! I didn't expect genshin to give a healing from depression girlie but I'm very happy about it.

Yk, reading your comment and mulling over more, I think my actual issue w/ 4.2 was the Traveller's lack of....idk, feelings? Empathy? Maybe it was just the ENG translation, but they seemed either indifferent to Furina or interested only insofar as they could get information ("This is great....I can get the information I wanted," they think, watching Furina have a breakdown lol?). I think their lack of reaction made Furina's misery feel unappreciated, like it didn't matter to anybody, despite character voice lines calling Furina amazing etc.
        I guess I can sort of see where you're coming from in a way, but it's because the main thought in the Traveler's head was "we need to try to stop this tragedy from occurring."  This was emphasized in the little "retrospective tour of Fontaine" while they asked everyone how they would handle the prophecy if it occurred.

At that time, they really thought that Furina's withholding the truth was potentially condemning the whole nation to death, and they couldn't at all understand why.  I think the Traveler was truly, genuinely hoping that Furina would open up to them privately before the trial so it'd all not have to happen (since they 100% legit wanted to help), and they did show that the Traveler was sad that it came to that.  And then, when meeting with Furina later on the stage, they still had that in the back of their mind: I need to figure out the missing piece of the puzzle so we can save Fontaine.  Keep in mind, all this time they've been forced to play this "detective" role, they've gotten the hint from N that it's possible to change fate a bit, and they think tons of lives are at stake.  (They also aren't seeing what Neuvillette is seeing, which we had partly seen.)  At the end when Furina reveals that she can't tell them, and reveals all her deeply personal reasons why, the Traveler can only accept her decision.  It's absolutely tragic, but it also doesn't get them closer to solving the problem.

In the end, I think it's really the difference between us in the audience and the Traveler as one player on the stage of fate.  In this case, the Traveler doesn't really fully represent us in the audience -- we can be full-on sympathetic to Furina because we know that one way or another we will end up fighting the boss and the day will be saved.  (You know everyone in Fontaine is not going to die because they just announced Navia as a character coming in 4.3, for instance!)  But the Traveler is living in the moment with the weight of the world on their shoulders.  No matter the obvious tragedy of Furina's life and all she went through, you can't really weigh it against the tragedy prophesized to unfold over all of Fontaine.  The Traveler was really not in quite the right state of mind to whole-heartedly sympathize with Furina in that moment.  Maybe they could have done a bit more to make that a bit more clear, but I did think it was there.

Definitely enjoy the character quest.  I think it should be considered "required reading" for sure.
    >the most tragic part was that the one time she had the glimmer of maybe being able to open up to someone, we stabbed her in the back.

This seems to be the major reason CN social platforms are trash talking the story of this patch from what I've seen

Edit: **One of** the major reasons. Another is that some believe that Furina deserves a much better ending, pointing out "Even Scara gets a better ending when he most certainly is even more sinned"

Edit #2: I was browsing on Tieba for context, which has some of the less friendly communities to Mihoyo. With the haters trying their best to find an "appropriate/justified" angle to point their fingers at Genshin, it shouldn't really be surprising that most of their screenshots they were quoting is negative reception to the story. **In addition, they are somewhat twisting the story to make it look worse to those who don't play**, *possibly in an attempt to worsen the paradigm on hoyo games*: For example, >!Furina eats macaroni daily because she isn't into cooking, but the haters claim this is proof that Furina is paid poorly and can't afford anything else. Her living place also clearly isn't as bad as the "sewers".!< When I manually try to search related topics on Weibo, for example, the negative voices seem to be much "diluted", so to speak.
        It was definitely a gut-punch to me as a player; it legit made me feel like a bad guy in the moment, putting her so obviously through more pain.  But, yeah, from everyone's point of view in-game, they were desperate to try to save Fontaine, and it's extremely hard to trust in someone whose only message is "trust me" when you know they're lying about who they are and they stubbornly refuse all chances to come clean.  There needs to be *some* basis for such a deep expectation of faith, and Focalors provided absolutely none.

So anyway... the way everyone acted was to me 100% realistic given the circumstances, but yeah... it was harsh.  I actually liked that the authors went there -- I think it's okay for them to make us uncomfortable at times, as sometimes being the bad guy in pursuit of the greater good is a fact of life -- but yeah, I can see how it'd be a controversial choice.
        >This seems to be the major reason CN social platforms are trash talking the story of this patch from what I've seen  
>  
>Edit: One of the major reasons. Another is that some believe that Furina deserves a much better ending, pointing out "Even Scara gets a better ending when he most certainly is even more sinned"

Do you happen to know if that's the general CN consensus on the story or would this be more similar to like going to twitter and picking out a random tweet about the story? (Not that i'm doubting you just curious). I'm interested to know how the other communities are taking the story, would be nice to see if you had any more info/summary
            At the very least that's the consensus **of those who hold negative opinions towards hoyo/genshin, including disheartened players whom they quoted.** Of those I seen that is. (Animosity towards hoyo is rather common in a few other communities I browse)

I've yet to hear voices from rather pro-Genshin communities like Bilibili content creators for example, to be perfectly honest, and I assume they're busy indulged/analyzing and haven't bothered to counterargument yet, if they intend to do that at all.
                I see, thanks for satisfying my curiosity! I did see your second edit too which helps puts thing into perspective.

Can't say I completely disagree with the "some believe that Furina deserves a much better ending, pointing out "Even Scara gets a better ending when he most certainly is even more sinned"" part, >!it did feel like Furina herself (Not focalors) was kinda forgotten at the end of the AQ. We didn't even get to see her off :( But I guess after what happened it makes sense she probably didn't want to see anyone!<
On the other hand, Furina gets a whole epilogue of her own in the form of her story quest (one of the best in the game), so it's not all bad
I'm fine with her suffering, but it's just weird how in a game where characters like Scaramouche and Ei get slaps on the wrist for their misdeeds, a character who really didn't even do anything of her own volition wrong gets (in game) hate to this degree.
    I mean, it does fit since she's a celebrity as well, it's like when celebrities/famous people in general IRL get exposed for some shit that should be otherwise just a small thing but got blown up out of proportion.

Barely anyone knows about Scaramouche's existence and Ei... well majority of Inazumans still revere her and Inazuma was based off the era in where the rulers had absolute say in things and were pretty much seen as divine beings, except in this case their ruler was a literal God, and the one that protects them at that + it was only a small part of Inazuma's population rebelling against her. 

Furina's case does feel the most human, which could be why we feel that she got too much hate but in reality, things would not be far off from what occured in game. Hell, it'd probably be worse lmao
        > Furina's case does feel the most human

I mean, yeah -- this is literally it.  Furina, as a "human," had to face the human consequences for Focalors' decision.  From their points of view, Furina herself was lying to them for 500 years to believe in her as their god when she had no powers at all (and the true god was nowhere to be seen).  Even if they may find out that she was told to do so by Focalors, and know objectively that she was doing it for their own good, it doesn't soothe the pain of betrayal, and she is the "face" of it all.  Is it a totally logical reaction?  No, of course not.  But especially in places like Poisson where the pain is fresh, it's not going to stop people from playing this sort of "what if" even if it's unreasonable.

I mean, if they truly sat down and thought about it, what were they going to do even if she *had* told them all along she was no god?  Could they have predicted it?  Would someone else really have been able to solve it and prevent it from happening?  It's completely illogical, but right now they need someone to blame, and Furina's betrayal gives them an easy scapegoat.

People may not be able to fathom the will of the gods, and may not understand why any tragedies are allowed to happen if the gods are really all-powerful beings.  I'm sure many in Watatsumi to this day still consider the Shogun's actions to by inexplicable (since they basically are, by human standards).  But people can understand when a human lies to them, no faith required.
    I think this is more a testament to how far they've come in terms of writing quality since Inazuma's absolute dumpster fire of an AQ and story quests till recently. Inazuma's archon quest at this point needs a full-on rehaul at some point in the future cause anything related to it sticks out in an extremely ugly fashion now.
    I think the problem is seeing bad things happening to characters as "punishment". Furina is a tragic and impactful figure *because* she doesn't deserve the things that happen to her. If she did, it would no longer be a tragedy. Not that I'm comparing the level of writing quality, but you wouldn't go up to Shakespeare and be like wow I think you did Romeo and Juliet dirty, don't you think their fighting families deserve to be punished instead of them? The emotional core of the story is that yes, indeed, Romeo and Juliet did not deserve that.
Pretty much in the same boat. I enjoyed the story itself but how Mihoyo utilized >!Furina, NOT Focalors and seeing her conclusion in the actual AQ is honestly bringing the enjoyment down a bit for me. I just hope her story quests gives her a bit more relevance because the way she just disappeared towards the end left a sour taste in my mouth and honestly, isn't giving me hopes for her relevancy in the future. Was hoping both Neuvillette and Furina would be a duo but the ending of the AQ basically felt like Mihoyo slapping me and telling me otherwise!<
damn liyue in third? it had like 10 good minutes and 4 hours of fetch quests.
    The finale really bumped it up for me and none of the quest throughout felt meaningless. They also technically improved it further through Beisht and Chasm. I think Liyue is the only one so far to see continuation after its original chapter.
    Liyue's finale is still one of the best moments in the game.
    I mean compared to Inazum which was basically 70% worthless build up to an under cooked finale. Liyue doesn't seem that bad im comparison... As for Mondstadt I find it on par with Liyue.
        Inazuma was mishandled but it wasn't until then where I fell in love with the story. I'd say liyue was my least favorite and mondstat only better for nostalgia reason, but that's just my opinion
Silver and Melus managed to protect her until Neuvillette could rescue her, the reason they could do that is because >!Primordial Seawater + people from Fontaine does not actually kill them but rather return them to their original form (but since they spent all their life as a human if they turn back to Oceanid they would have no idea how to use the shapeshifting ability normal Oceanids would instinctively know how to use)!<
I don‚Äôt think she was going to open up. With the play scenes in Furina‚Äôs mind, she ended up not saying anything, chances are the same would‚Äôve happened if Lyney did nothing
so from what I can understand there are 2 particular categories: Descenders who travel to Teyvat from other worlds and the other group are people who are capable of travelling from Teyvat to other worlds (Alice). not sure what category Skirk master is
people who got dissolved before Neuvillette gets his powers returned stayed "dissolved" at least for this current time, they are not dead however so there is a chance that Neuvillette in the future might be able to bring them back somehow
    Sure that ‚Äúcould‚Äù happen in the future, but as of right now it feels like we just say ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs done is done‚Äù and dont even wonder whether we can save them with Neuvillette‚Äôs power. And it‚Äôs exactly because they aren‚Äôt truly dead that it is annoying. If they are actually just dead, then yeah we can‚Äôt bring the dead back to life, but they aren‚Äôt and the traveler and Neuvillette knows that
Furina's story is continued in her story quest
Could not have worded it any better üò≠ Furina's whole conclusion is that she's human- and right now, her miserable state is a painfully clear and stark show of her humanity. And every Archon we've seen really has also shown a lot of humanity despite their divine status- Furina simply shows it a lot more on account of her finally shedding a "character" she's had to play for centuries. Dare I say she's one of the best written characters we've had so far. 

And agreed, the whale boss complaints make a lot of sense when you compare it to Shouki no Kami for example, so I understand those. But saying it's as bad as Inazuma is a huge stretch lol
    Honestly Furina playing the act of a GOD for HUNDREDS OF YEARS is one of the most impressive feats any character has done in Genshin. The amount of will power and resilience to pull of something like that is absurd and makes her one of my Favourite characters in the Game so far, the fact she did it for selfless reasons aswell. she did what most never could dream of doing. She deserves her rest.
I don‚Äôt understand it frankly. People have complained for years that Genshin storytelling is too childish and lighthearted. They finally take a risk in Fontaine with taking the story in a darker direction with true representations of loss, sadness and suffering and suddenly ‚Äúoh no that‚Äôs too much, bring back the sunshine and rainbows!‚Äù Sheesh all I can say is I hope none of these people respond to the feedback survey and ruin it for the rest of us. This act was a breath of fresh air in an otherwise predictable and stale narrative experience.
Don't know why you're being so condescending.

I understand what they tried to do, I just think they did it badly. And yes, how Furina was treated is part of that. If they want her to suffer fine, but the way she's treated is borderline nonsensical, especially by the traveler and Paimon. And there's lots of other details that are questionable too and make the future of the setting worrisome.

Is it better or worse than 2.1, I can't say. I certainly had more fun fighting Raiden than the camera of the whale, at least, so 2.1 wins by a mile gameplay-wise. And for storywise, remember people loved and adamantly defended 2.1 for like a month post-release too. We'll see if the same happens here once the hype wears down and people look at it more critically.
    Eh, I remember a lot of people shitting on 2.1 right out the gate, even though they did love some sections of it. Signora‚Äôs death was wildly controversial and a lot of people felt as if Raiden got off lightly, not to mention the info dump at the end and Scaramouche‚Äôs casual drive by where he did fuck all except bully the traveler, grab the gnosis, and gtfo‚Äôd

The one part people were defending in 2.1 was Raiden getting away Scott free with insane levels of neglect and letting the Commissions and her Puppet Daughter nearly drive the country to ruin from greed from the Commissions and Apathy from the Shogunator.
>the whale battle and resolution was so lackluster imo.

How the fuck would you kill an eldritch pet of someone.
    No, I mean like, it was so short. You get one phase of the whale where you try it hit it as it flops around, then you randomly go fight the guy inside, and then it just ends. No second whale phase, it just cuts straight to >!Skirk casually yeeting it out of existence then everyone in Fontaine ‚Äúdrowning‚Äù.!< After doing the weekly boss version, I don‚Äôt see why they can‚Äôt let us do phase 2 in the story as well? We did it for Raiden, Scaramouche, Signora. We even beat up Dvalin all the way.

Idk for the big weekly boss of the whole chapter I was expecting more significance in the story. It was there, and then it was gone.
        The story quest especially Archon quest bosses need to be accessible for everyone, so the difficulty and length will not be hard. The first Childe boss when it was dropped was actually a bit challenging but large portions of the player base complained and said they were stuck and can't progress the story. 

So the devs need to consider the overall player base and the ability for people of varying character investment, skill level etc to progress the story. The domain version should be a bit harder.
            They added an option to decrease domain difficulty for story bosses with this update.

Alternatively, massively nerf the HP pool and mechanics and keep the phases, like they‚Äôve done with all the previous weekly bosses. Neuvillette will also heal you if your character dies (I think, my Charlotte died and magically revived with full HP at one point).

I don‚Äôt mind the boss being way easier or shorter for story mode. I just feel a story boss should showcase the complete fight and not stop halfway. It feels like if Apep ended with the turret protection phase, or Scaramouche ends once you hit him with the special action. I was ready to wack the whale, and then it just ended.
        To be far, when you finish Fontaine, you already powerful and have vast of OP characters under your belt with full set and proper team building and strategies. 

 Imagine you only has Mona and 4 stars units, your relics are still green, vapor team and fight against pre nerf Childe. I did.
Had to do it fast before youtube and tiktok spoiled it all üòî
act 3 was completely wasted imo (we only went there to find Childe and we never did), more time should have been spent on first Hydro Archon (Traveller needed to find out what happened during Cataclysm and Khaneriah) and the Whale. Act 2 was important though because it had loads of foreshadowing for Act 4 and Act 5
> it being miserable to see

It wasn't the first time they pulled *that* off.

"I woke up in a flower carriage..."
I agree with you. Despite Furina acting for a long time, in the end, she wasn't really acknowledged for her effort. The quest was only closed with Neuvillete saying she was tired and wanted to have some rest. I do wish at some point those who were involved with 'final opera' meet her and have some conversation. But maybe the dev have the segment kept for the next version. But for now, I really can't look at other Fontaine characters like I normally did. Probably including traveller seeing how she also pushes her to know the secret.

Personally, doing the AQ, I can feel Furina's tiredness and frustration on how she was hoping there were solutions for the prophecy while acting as a "God" for Fontaine people. I guess seeing in the end, how she was trying to help the Fontainian, but with the cost of those whom she holds precious despise her. It's something that gives me a deep impact. I...happy that I chose to pull for her and before doing this quest, I really want Neuvillete. But I don't think I want him at my party to do the journey afterwards. I don't blame him for what happened as this is what Focalors is planning for. Hmm... I guess another reason will be on how everyone is starting to get warm with the Fatui. And how easy the Gnosis to give away.
    > Furina acting for a long time, in the end, she wasn't really acknowledged for her effort

Umm no read Neuv's line about Furina
the sumeru quest told us that it seems like the heavenly principles is sleeping. Perhaps this wasent enough to wake it.
    but then why bother with egeria's plan....
Avoiding Youtube spoiler thumbnails at all cost.
to regular people, an Archon is basically just a really powerful god with mastery over the element they preside over (this is reinforced in the Trial about what the court thinks an Archon is). Neuvillette as far as regular people think is a god (he's been around over 500 years they know this) and he is well versed in using Hydro so as far as they are concerned he is the Hydro Archon, it helps that he is the Chief Justice as well.

They are "ok" with Furina being a regular girl because of the trial where the court judged her to not be the Hydro Archon (which was true).

They don't know about Dragon Sovereigns being the original Archons and all that, also they won't know about Hydro Archon position being destroyed so no more "official" Hydro Archons (Celestia on the other hand...)
\- Fontaine's teaser is called the Final Feast (The Last Supper)

\- A god in human form

\- Part of a plan to save people from their sin

\- Can walk on water

Yep
Her story is legit more tragic than Nahida. Nahida may have been physically confined, but having control over dreams, she could at least still communicate with her people and see distant lands. Furina's stuck pretending to be someone she's not for hundreds of years, knowing that making even the slightest mistake can end up killing everyone in Fontaine someday. And having to do all that while having the mind of a mortal.
She might not be the "real archon" . But she did take on the responsibilities of an Archon AS A HUMAN. Imo that makes her just as much of an archon as well.. The archons.
She is the real archon though? The quest drove that home. If youve got a coin and on one side you have heads and on the other you have tails, it doesn‚Äôt matter which side you‚Äôre looking at, it‚Äôs still the coin.
She still was, or at least part of her. Most of the "not the real archon" arguments were about a completely different person being the real archon which was not true.
I mean, she technically still is? 

She's like, half an archon.
I was one of them ü§° it's okay though she is still the archon of my heart and that's what matters most üòî
Did you do her story quest?
based on leaks i was upset that furina was turned into a normal human with no archon-ness but after playing it i think its good. she doesnt want to be an archon, she deserves a normal life after all that. sure she couldve kept her divine body to be special but any ending with her staying as the archon wouldve been weird

its the issue where people want subverted expectations and the archon quest formula to be changed, but when it happens people are mad that the archon is no longer an archon.

also is it a retcon? i was under the impression destroying the hydro throne also affected and basically broke the gnosis, which is why neuvillette was so fine with giving it away
    Okay, let‚Äôs subvert tropes. Next time a male exists to elevate a female in this story
Fontaine is Archon less now
He is not the archon. The place of the archon is now gone. Focalors will remain as the last Hydro archon.
for Hoyoverse marketing purposes no, in story according to people of Fontaine yes
Nahida at the very least could use her Archon powers (dreamwalking etc.), Furina on the other hand was completely powerless.
Would be nice if she had interactions with Nahida one day
    Furina is trapped into her role as an archon, Nahida was trapped because she did not "fit" her role as an archon.

Are there divine beings therapists in Teyvat?
        That's the job of the Traveller. üòÖ
            They give therapy sessions to intercelstial beings in exchange for only a couple of sentences worth lead on their sibling. What a chad.
        Venti?
            Venti is a drunkard, like literally drinking his "traumas" away, we don't need baby Furina and Nahida following in his footsteps
    Oohh they would be best friends. Furina would go well as Wanderer's sister.
    Honestly furina is one of the few archons that are not really tied to their nation like nahida and ei so im hoping they give this girl all the screentime
From "must correct üò≠üí¢" to "must protect üò§üõ°Ô∏è"
Wished the people at the end would at least thank her after the flood and she would kneel down finally feeling relieved and cry everything out.
    That's the thing, no one knows. Only Neuvillete and the Traveler really know what she went through. For the people of Fontaine, Furina just stepped down, not dying because Neuvillete took pity on her.
That was some genuine cosmic horror shit.

I hope Furina now moves to Mondstat or Liyue and lives a nice peaceful live.
    Fuck it, give her a permanent residence in the teapot. Make it canon.
        No. She's been trapped long enough. Let her live her life for once
            Vacation home in the teapot
    I have no mouth, but I must scream
Pre-release there were a lot of people who didn‚Äôt like it after reading the leaks, which I didn‚Äôt understand because I thought this story was great. Glad to see that the majority of people like it.
She‚Äôs like a bicycle

 She‚Äôs too tired
    Cyno please
    Cyno, this isn't the right time

*screenshots the joke*
Well maybe we will get some answers on her character quest
play characters quest, its really good, different side of her
This is my criticism towards the archon quest
The entire thing was major character development for her and it absolutely is in my top 5 character quests. She said enough as it was happening.
This is my only real gripe with it. It gave great closure on Focalors, but Furina not so much. As far as I understand it everyone in Fontaine still only think she deceived them for her own gain right? Or at least, they don't know the sacrifice she has made
I think they used her story quest to approach that .
    Sadly her story quest turned into typical genshin quest for the most part with some really good Furina moments. Those moments are good enough to like it but I wish it focused some more on the effects of the AQ on Furina. Here's hoping for a banger 2nd story quest
        I liked the quest, surely its not the neuvillette story quest but i think it fits her current state, now that she is human she lives more normal things and can be more free on her decicions.

But i wonder if she or neuvillette would be recieving a second story for the next weekly boss.
            I do appreciate exploring her human side but going straight to the story quest after the aq was a huge jump from Furina breaking down and then watching as her nation gets flooded but actually things are fine straight to Furina already breaking her rule about not doing performance arts and being fairly light hearted.

Sure, this could be a testament to her strong will but I just wish her SQ1 expanded more on her moving out, maybe having Traveler apologize for tricking her, and even maybe letting Furina confide in them and letting it all out. It would be p cool for the current sq1 to actually have been her sq2 to signal her growth and ability to move on perhaps.

Still, it was a good sq with a banger song at the end and the whole thing serves to even further show Furina's iron will due to how quickly she got back on her feet after something so traumatizing. I'm just pondering.
That was crazily dark for Genshin. Usually they save the really dark stuff for the world quests, but the fact that a main character went through that tormet is rough.
    I am done with her story quest, and I'm quite happy to see her doing fine as a human being, also the moment she got her vision made me happy too, but now I have this doubt about how she got the vision(maybe she is too ambitious about acting )
        Hydro visions are for people that fill a role they believe in even if its not who they really are. Out a principle or belief its the right thing to do. Its less ambition and more a sense of duty. I wanna say her getting the vision right then was because she made the decision to step up even if its painful to herself.
            You're right, She also mentioned this in her voice line 'about the vision'.
        I havent played that quest yet and will only be able to tomorrow, can u tell me if her quest is set after or before act 5?
            It is set after act 5!
Yeah raiden nahida, Kuki still kill him without much of a issue
i think it wouldve been nice if we got some scenes inbetween, like an act 10~ years in, one 50 years in, etc. show her coming to terms with this shit taking a normal humans lifespan in length
    I think they did that pretty effectively via the subjects she was meeting all being from the same bloodline (talking about how her grandma 20 generations back idolized her)
        yeah i get that, but im more meaning about seeing her reaction to the length of time. we see her reactions to the first week, then jump to 500 years. wouldve been great to see her in her room 10 years later realizing "holy fuck"
            It just meant that it took 500 years to finally make her breakdown which shows her willpower. She was even smiling while tears flowing from her even making excuses.
Neuv literally skipped most of the fight for us.
Id rather have him appear as a trial character. It was too hard to make out, with a lot going on screen already.
May you get c6 for any character you wish in a 10 pull. That was beautiful
new childe bow just dropped
    holy celestia
Reminder that Childe's goal was to get his master to fight him using both hands finally. The fact that Skirk yeeted him with just one hand still is kind of brutal
Childe was having the time of his life fighting that giant Narwhal, his whole thing is fighting strong opponents and he got the chance to square the fuck up to an ancient cosmic all devouring entity, Skirk is just gently tossing her disciple into bed to rest, she's so nice to him.
    Gently huh
Was it really trash talking him though? She said she doesnt talk to weak people which is why she didnt sat much to childe sure, but that was reffering to him when he was a a kid/teen.
he wasnt worth her trashtalking to kekl
I‚Äôm calling the Childe Protection Service!
It's not confirmed, but nahida assumes it 

[skip to 2:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_DAoV-NWU)
    Also the Abyss is the Second Who Came, which would have to make Celestia the first.
        The abyssal realm has always existed in Teyvat.

The dragons were the light realm and the abyss was the void realm.
    I'm going to have to revisit that conversation
Wouldn't the primordial one aka the first who came be the first descender? Unless Heavenly principle and primordial one is same person.
I'm guessing that Focalors was counting on Celestia to prevent or intervene in the case of all-out war between the nations. That or how technically advanced Fontaine is in comparison to other nations aside from Snehznya, would've scared off other countries that didn't know Furina was quite powerless
    current day Fontaine is indeed quite strong but in the early days (100 years into the 500 year plan for example) we don't know how powerful Fontaine was. A rogue evil god like Osial or his wife could have tried to conquer Fontaine (just using an example) and well...
        True, also I can't imagine how stressed the fuck out Furina would be if an Osial showed up lmao, she'd go insane
Yeah I really love how it recontextualizes everything, at first you think she‚Äôs just a funny girlfailure but then you realize she might just be the most dedicated Archon yet.
And The fcking traveler and Paimon taking audacity to comfort her in story quest after Aether destroyed and humiliated her in Archon quest
    Tbf The Traveler was only doing what he thought was right at the time. He never would‚Äôve humiliated Furina if he knew the full story. Given the facts he had, it‚Äôs a reasonable conclusion that he wanted to stop a poser from giving people false hope
    This is so true, they don't deserve to do that, what they needed is to apologize sincerely since it's what Furina deserved. The nerve lmao
    Yes. Seriously noted that for complain
I imagine that Inazuma could have been on the quality of those two if it wasn‚Äôt rushed.

The whole Furina/Focalors plot felt like a more fleshed out version of Raiden/Ei.
    The whole Watatsumi island and Raiden's dimension should've been 2 different acts.
    Inazuma actually had great themes and ideas, but it was paced really badly, probably due to COVID development or something.
        Yes. Inazuma makes me so mad because there was so much potential there. It had the chance to be something amazing.
    Even Neuvillete's thoughts about his belonging in this world where quite similar to the ones Ganyu has, but the execution and depth to them is miles away. Their storytelling has improve SO MUCH.
    This is so real, Inazuma was awesome to me as a regi√≥n but if only its story couldve been delivered as well as sumerus or fontaines It wouldve been the second BEST (cuz It wouldnt top fontaine for me tbh)
This is prob why Venti hasn't had his chara story.
Teppei crawled so Dunyarzad could run and live and so Melus and Silver could be an NPC sacrifice done well. Honestly even after being dissolved they still were devoted to keeping her alive, it got me good best subordinates
Melus literally sounded like my grandpa when he would read stories out loud to me in a "David Attenborough" voice and it made me SOB
my only issue is that the whale is a pet. not only does that mean we have some absurd powerscaling of someone taming it, but the entire doomsday prophecy being due to the whims of some strong dude wanting to feed his space whale is odd
    That's been there since the beginning. Skirk likened her master to the alchemist Gold, and Gold was responsible for the cataclysm where multiple archons died
        genuinely fair point, i guess it just feels different reading about ancient lore of a powerful alchemist, versus skirk nonchalantly being like "lol yeah he was feeding his pet whale"
Genshin Impact is a part of larger universe so that didn't bother me much. It's a reminder that there are far more dangerous things lurking outside of Teyvat.
    I mean I know that. Traveler is basically like an amnesic space hero. It's just that in the context of the whole Fontaine arc which is more focused on solving mysteries in prisons, the opera, and the city, trying to save people from a prophesied flood, the sudden appearance of an intergalactic space monster seems out of place. Not to mention that Fontaine is mecha/steampunk-esque in design and atmosphere so I didn't expect the interdimensional narwhal tbh. They did tease the whale last patch so maybe it's just me ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Still love Act V as a whole tho üíú
        I thought it fits the whole fate theme, child Childe being the accidental trigger but later also being necessary to hold the whale off for a few weeks to finish the prophecy with the trial. And all the pieces that needed to perfectly fit for Focalor plans to work out. It also adds a whole layer of more mystery to Albedos master (she has too many names), it certainly takes powers out of this world to do what she supposedly did. If you think about it, a lot of the most impactful influence in Teyvat came from outside - the descenders being in the centre of everything. Anyways, sorry for the tangent. In my mind the space whale fits right in.
i just realized feels like the primodordial whale is the equivalent of neuvilette as a leviathan/whale in draconic form. so maybe it's like primordial whale vs dragon whale
If I had to guess, maybe they plan to ressurect the third descender and return power to the dragons in order to overthrow Celestia?
    Oh. My. God. 

The resurrecting the third descender part is possible and would be amazing.
        That would be so cool. Collect all the pieces and the third descender lives again
    Third Descender, aka Exodia
    How about waiting for the 4th descender to collect all 7 elements and then kill it. Having ang Omni element Gnosis is crack. Hahah
    im sure others have mentioned it before but act 5 is called "Incandescent Ode of Resurrection" maybe not the dragon stuff because that seems harder but the first part kinda checks out because they would have all the gnosis at the end of the next act right.
Arlecchino basically all but confirming that Fatui plans revolve around the world as a whole. Can only wonder how the Gnosis all come into play, especially as Skirk describing them as misfortune

The fact the lore drops that they are remains of the third descender in on itself is such a big revelation. Can only wonder what the Fatui plan on doing with them and whether it will work considering they apparently bring misfortune
    I mean, hard to say how exactly they will be used, but presumably they're planning to use their power in some way to overthrow Celestia.
    Yeah , now with many AQs until today, now I think about It, that the fatui and harbingers May Not be that evil after all ( with some exceptions) 
But the abyss Organization is still kinda evil
    >as misfortune

Given the context of their little chat, it felt a bit like a threat to me. Like "Oh you have so much money in your hand, would really be a pity if I had to kill you to get it."
they already have six of the seven gnosis (one stolen, four peacefully exchanged, and one from the tsaritsa herself). the last one is in natlan, which just so happens to be in the nation of *war*. i foresee a huge war coming fighting over the last gnosis (just like how in infinity war the last infinity stone was obtained after a huge battle)
I had the same exact reaction. BUT, I thought about it and realized the fatui are probably on the same side as the traveler, getting back at/killing the heavenly principles. Pretty sure they are either going to use the gnoses power or resurrect the 3rd descender.
Why are you so sure that Teyvat is fucked if they get all the gnoses? To me it seems like the Tsaritsa‚Äôs plan is to go to war with the Heavenly Principles, which means we could be on the same side after all.
It was the most successful Fatui operation to date. They saved lives in  Fontaine. They established good relations with court of Fontaine and Spina de Rosula. And they got a gnosis of the hydro archon in a trade/reward for their efforts. Unlike the rest of the nations they‚Äôre not persona non grata with Fontaine for now.
Don't say what "they" did to Electro Gnosis. It was only Dottore
This. I stayed up to finish it so I wouldn't be spoiled. Absolutely worth it.
    Same. Had to stay home from school cause I was too tired to drive in the morning. It feels irresponsible to say, but it was absolutely worth it. But fuck it, it's like missing a day of school to see a midnight release Endgame or the final Harry Potter or something.
    Yeah I went to bed at 1 am on a work night just so I could finish it. Worth it
    Agreed. No regrets at all.
Literally yes. The spoilers run rampant everywhere
    6am rn I haven't had a wink of sleep, I am so glad I held off on spoilers to witness this quest. Peak writing
        Same haven't finish the archon and character quest until 6 am. Had no sleep. Worth it.
Oh god if this isn't me but with fear of reddit spoilers. I just got on reddit after finishing the very long AQ (I think I was playing for 4 hrs straight üíÄ) but it was worth it! Will do the story quest tomorrow so y'all can't spoil me anymore üòÇ
Use youtube block extension.
This. Is imposible just to see youtube, tik tok, twitter, etc
Wym relatively short? It was roughly 4 hours. Fitting for an act v
    I meant compared to previous patches where we had 2 acts. Hence the reason why I said ‚Äúonly 1 act.‚Äù
        Valid I guess. It took me roughly the same about of time to finish this one act vs the two in the last patch so I based my judgement off that
"How about we explore the area ahead of us later?"
‚ÄúSuck to be them‚Äù
ILLUSIONS OF THE ASS
Yea but the whole nation is higher than whole region of Mondstad, I haven't seen how the land between those 2 nation's looks from new region, but even then, water from Fontaine flows all the way to liyue, which means everything there would be flooded too. Also the water level was high enough to sink the city of Fontaine and I think it rose higher than dragonspine peak, it had to be magically contained somehow
I just did Furina‚Äôs Story Quest and ugly cried, AGAIN. THIS IS THE FOURTH TIME FOR THE DAY.. üò≠üò≠
    SOBBING WEEPING RN
I sort figured the line would show up in their conversation, but it still got me in the feels when she said it
And then Furina also say that line to him in the future event.
Third descender could be your real sibling.
    Honestly I thought that too like maybe they counted it as our sibling getting into Teyvat first and then us which is 2 simultaneous Descenders at the same time but then I remembered, we came there just 500 years ago, the Archon wars, especially the fight between the Dragons, 1st and 2nd descender happened for who knows how long ago that it's inconceivable for our twin to be dismembered for it because the Archons already existed 2000+ years ago when the original Seven were seated, unless the Heavenly Principle did some wonky timeline shenanigans where she sent our sibling to the past to be put on the chopping block and then us in the future as some sort of spare or whatever (Paimon being sent as a tracker and sticking her to us) and then it becomes some sort of loop, I dunno
    I thought our sibling belonged to this world so they couldn‚Äôt be the descender? Am I wrong?
        You're thinking of the Abyss Sibling. They are a part of this world, and because of that, they can't be our real sibling, but likely a clone with the same memories.
Every time the story progresses, we see more and more "skeletons in Celestia's closet"
>!I mean Focalor indirectly told him to judge them for her. I'm sure he's thinking him judging them is the justice both Furina and Focalor deserve.!<
    Finishing the AQ also >!unlocks the "about the Archons" voice lines where he also confirms this. Every one of them is about judging them and their authority as God's. He does feel bad for Buer being neglected though, a nice note!<
Exactly. I hope we get some kind of follow-up
I second that. Genshin's score/soundtrack is quickly rivalling that of the Halo series- at least in my heart.
I'm sure people are going to make gamerips of it. I might do the same, actually.
And when Childe shows up, his version of the harbinger theme completely takes over the track.
I haven't gotten THAT far in the Aranara world quest. I'm still quite far from what I perceive to be the end of it.
    I see. The Withering music in Sumeru is some of my favourites musics in the game
        The Withering theme is pretty darn good.
Before the Light Fades is such a great track, I love how it‚Äôs almost completely antithetical to the rest of Sumeru‚Äôs sound track, really gives the feeling that this is something foreign and hostile
I lost it the moment Furina involuntarily started shedding tears during her talk the the woman. It's such a relatable and hard-hitting scene for 'putting a brave face' type of people.
    ‚ÄúSuch display of Archon power‚Äù
How will Hoyo insert the Celestia waking up between Natlan and Snezhnaya, something I‚Äôm excited about
Nah she means they defeated without relying on the abyss powers, because she uses it
Not even about strength, but acting like he‚Äôs the source of all of Furina‚Äôs misery and he‚Äôs the reason she wound up getting depressed, when it‚Äôs painfully obvious he still cares for her. He just sucks at expressing himself.
It was a good ending for her. That expression she showed at the cutscene after the flood tells everything. That was a look of relief, freedom. That summarizes her good ending although we do not see her directly interacting with others.
This is fucking true. She fucking hated being an archon god damit let her fucking rest
She is the recognized Archon, Neiuvilette technically is a Sovereign. Additionally, Archon is simply a title that can be given and taken away, people should not be too hyper focused on that point, personal opinion.

What this quest more so asks the player is what does it truly mean to be an Archon, what defines an Archon? Is it the all power and might, is it the love for the people and nation, is the the support of all their subjects, is it doing what is necessary to protect what is important to them, is it the shoulder the burden and duties of the people and nation etc.

Personally feel this quest is more about the deconstruction of the idea of the so called traditional Archon and stressing the humanity of gods or rather the divinity of humans. Even though Furina does not fit the ideal criteria of the traditional Archon title, she still did what an Archon must for the nation and people, personal opinion.

That goes back to the point of not all stories need to follow the same pattern or arrive at the same conclusion, variety is key especially considering a long running story and ensemble cast (7 Archons, 7 Stories) so certain characters facing different circumstances and challenges are necessary, all characters do not need to have fantasy good endings, sprinkling of misfortune and tragedy is a vital part of good stories.
    If zhongli can retire from being a archon but the community is still calling him one then I don't see why we can't do the same with furina.
        Because he is recognized as an Archon in authority, and we now know from Neuvillette's voice lines that Zhongli still, like all Archons (unconsciously) hands out Visions

&#x200B;

Now, handing out Visions is Neuvillette's job, not Furina's, she has no authority over Hydro

so yeah I wouldn't consider her in the same bracket as Nahida, Raiden, Venti or Zhongli
            >!He's not an Archon. The throne of the hydro archon has been destroyed by Focalor, no one will ever inherit the title of "hydro Archon" ever again. Neuvillette is the hydro sovereign. If you consider him as archon then you should also recognize Apep.!<
            Where is it stated that zhongli still hands out the visions? He doesn‚Äôt even have the gnosis anymore. Id like to know the exact quote
                Neuvillette Vision story, it explicitly says he hands out Visions now. If the other archons didn't hand them out anymore, it would have been mentioned.

&#x200B;

Even when Raiden didn't have her Gnosis for 500yrs since she gave it to Yae, people (like Fischl) still got electro visions, so logically them not having a Gnosis doesn't matter since the Archons have Authority over elements, and Furina gave her Authority to Neuvillette so he now hands out Visions despite being a Dragon Sovereign and not an Archon. No other Archon handed over Authority, so despite their lack of gnosis, they still give out visions and are archons to me, unlike Furina.

&#x200B;

Neuvillette Vision Story:

&#x200B;

"From that day on, whenever a person's wishes reached the heavens, the seven overseers of the material realm were duty-bound to grant them a gift. Though they might know nothing of who or what wish had stepped into the threshold of the sacred, the Seven Archons still had to impart a shattered shard of their mastery to that person. And when one so gifted completed their duty... the gift the gods would receiving in return would be more abundant still."

"Neuvillette obeys no edict from the heavens, but he does acknowledge human will. So he too set aside parts of himself, as like unto the dragon-treasure hoards of old, awaiting valiant humans to come and claim them."
                    Seems like such an arbitrary metric to judge who the archon is. Moreover, I think you're latching on too much to inference considering we know that the raiden shogun didn't know she was handing out visions either. Whose to say zhongli/venti/raiden/nahida are still doing it? Certainly not that passage, no?

It's just you inferencing that they do it, we don't know that they still do without the gnoses. Furina is one part of focalors, the hydro archon. The game will treat her as the archon for all intents and purposes.

Then I guess, to you, the archon is just no one? because according to that exact same quote you gave it cannot be neuvilette. He doesn't obey the edict from the heavens and does it off his own will.
            they put Furina in the anniversary art this year with the rest of the Archons, maybe just to avoid spoilers but we'll get a real answer next year when they release the next anniversary art if we see Furina or Neuvilette.
    Besides Zhongli himself said that the age of the gods is coming to an end. I think this aq solidified that. As Dainslief said "humans have their humanity" and it was Furina's humanity that saved Fontaine.
        Truly Cooking!!! The point of Archon quests is not to follow some formulaic pattern for each archon but progress the overall world and story progression. This archon quest progressed the weakening of archons powers, hence the end of the age of gods, and the Dain statement as mentioned above.

Also this is setting up to allow room for a new party of players, the Sovereigns to make an impact and entrance later (Natlan) and stir the story further with how Celestia, Sovereigns, Descenders, Archons, Travelers, Fatui and many some other currently unknown characters from beyond etc will connect and interact.
I suspect Teyvat is pretty rapidly racing towards the abolition of the Archons, anyway. They're Celestia's minions and at this point, it's pretty obvious the Fatui are probably looking to aim their gnoses death laser (or whatever they have planned) upwards. Also, the other Archons didn't seem all that attached to their gnoses, either. Half of them don't act in their positions as gods anymore, either. So what makes them Archons, really?

And considering what Celestia has done to the dragons, I think Neuvillette would be insulted to be called an Archon. He's more like the Liyue Qixing, plus his added responsibility of being a living battery because Fontaine is in the steampunk era.
If you want to get technical Ei was never actually an archon either
    well, if we go by the theory that every nation has a kind of "throne" for an archon to sit on, Ei would be the successor to Makoto in filling the role.
Well, I mean Hoyo never promised anyone anything about a supposedly all archon team so... 

Besides, if they wanted, there are already 4 archon archons that can form a team lol
If you were to call Neuvilette an Archon to his face he might just smash your head off lol.
I was thinking of that too when I was about to play the quest
exactly how i felt. i was a little too obsessed (as an archon collector) with her being an archon, but actually playing the quest holy shit she deserves to *not* be an archon. after 500 years she earned her right to be a normal person with a normal life
The twin was also involved with the whole Caribert incident in Sumeru
I don‚Äôt really agree with the 1st one though. One of the biggest struggle/sacrifice of Furina is that she was all alone. She did not have anybody to confide to, didn‚Äôt have anybody who can know her secret, talk to her about it. I don't think Focalors talked to Furina ever since she started playing god.....
    Well, Focalors certainly wasn't going to substitute for a "companion" either way, because she's the one that put her up to this cruel responsibility in the first place.  What Furina was looking for, to be less lonely, was a friend -- someone she could confide her secret to and who could empathize with what she's going through.

I'm not necessarily suggesting they were constantly talking to each other or anything -- perhaps it's been centuries since she did any intervention at all.  But, Focalors was definitely the one who setup Neuvillette's role as part of her plan, so one way or another it was her "will" that was guiding that to happen.  Based on what we know of Furina's personality and the truth behind it all now, I would still tend to believe that somehow that was the voice of Focalors to Neuvillette coming through, and not just part of Furina's act.
Focalors in game (in the AQ) talks very differently with a sort of deeper voice than those trailer lines though. Neuvillette also did not look like he ever seen Focalors before when he met her in the AQ. There was no sense of familiarity in the tone. (imo, I could be wrong, but it really felt like this to me.)
None of these gets any answer. I have done the SQ
When skirk said she was going to slash 3 millions times i was like "don't worry the traveler will stil whoop your ass if there is an occasion.
Yeah, especially since it undermines ageria's entire plan. Like, what's the point of deceiving them if they won't react either way? Unless I'm missing something? 

The lore in this game is great, so I'm sure there's a good reason. But it doesn't change how disappointing it feels right now.
She stuck her hand into the water from the primordial sea she was ready to end it all my heart
    Or hope to pull it off and prolong the character as long as she can, even risking her life for it.
I've only just started her character quest and i'm excited to see where it goes! I didn't expect genshin to give a healing from depression girlie but I'm very happy about it.

Yk, reading your comment and mulling over more, I think my actual issue w/ 4.2 was the Traveller's lack of....idk, feelings? Empathy? Maybe it was just the ENG translation, but they seemed either indifferent to Furina or interested only insofar as they could get information ("This is great....I can get the information I wanted," they think, watching Furina have a breakdown lol?). I think their lack of reaction made Furina's misery feel unappreciated, like it didn't matter to anybody, despite character voice lines calling Furina amazing etc.
    I guess I can sort of see where you're coming from in a way, but it's because the main thought in the Traveler's head was "we need to try to stop this tragedy from occurring."  This was emphasized in the little "retrospective tour of Fontaine" while they asked everyone how they would handle the prophecy if it occurred.

At that time, they really thought that Furina's withholding the truth was potentially condemning the whole nation to death, and they couldn't at all understand why.  I think the Traveler was truly, genuinely hoping that Furina would open up to them privately before the trial so it'd all not have to happen (since they 100% legit wanted to help), and they did show that the Traveler was sad that it came to that.  And then, when meeting with Furina later on the stage, they still had that in the back of their mind: I need to figure out the missing piece of the puzzle so we can save Fontaine.  Keep in mind, all this time they've been forced to play this "detective" role, they've gotten the hint from N that it's possible to change fate a bit, and they think tons of lives are at stake.  (They also aren't seeing what Neuvillette is seeing, which we had partly seen.)  At the end when Furina reveals that she can't tell them, and reveals all her deeply personal reasons why, the Traveler can only accept her decision.  It's absolutely tragic, but it also doesn't get them closer to solving the problem.

In the end, I think it's really the difference between us in the audience and the Traveler as one player on the stage of fate.  In this case, the Traveler doesn't really fully represent us in the audience -- we can be full-on sympathetic to Furina because we know that one way or another we will end up fighting the boss and the day will be saved.  (You know everyone in Fontaine is not going to die because they just announced Navia as a character coming in 4.3, for instance!)  But the Traveler is living in the moment with the weight of the world on their shoulders.  No matter the obvious tragedy of Furina's life and all she went through, you can't really weigh it against the tragedy prophesized to unfold over all of Fontaine.  The Traveler was really not in quite the right state of mind to whole-heartedly sympathize with Furina in that moment.  Maybe they could have done a bit more to make that a bit more clear, but I did think it was there.

Definitely enjoy the character quest.  I think it should be considered "required reading" for sure.
>the most tragic part was that the one time she had the glimmer of maybe being able to open up to someone, we stabbed her in the back.

This seems to be the major reason CN social platforms are trash talking the story of this patch from what I've seen

Edit: **One of** the major reasons. Another is that some believe that Furina deserves a much better ending, pointing out "Even Scara gets a better ending when he most certainly is even more sinned"

Edit #2: I was browsing on Tieba for context, which has some of the less friendly communities to Mihoyo. With the haters trying their best to find an "appropriate/justified" angle to point their fingers at Genshin, it shouldn't really be surprising that most of their screenshots they were quoting is negative reception to the story. **In addition, they are somewhat twisting the story to make it look worse to those who don't play**, *possibly in an attempt to worsen the paradigm on hoyo games*: For example, >!Furina eats macaroni daily because she isn't into cooking, but the haters claim this is proof that Furina is paid poorly and can't afford anything else. Her living place also clearly isn't as bad as the "sewers".!< When I manually try to search related topics on Weibo, for example, the negative voices seem to be much "diluted", so to speak.
    It was definitely a gut-punch to me as a player; it legit made me feel like a bad guy in the moment, putting her so obviously through more pain.  But, yeah, from everyone's point of view in-game, they were desperate to try to save Fontaine, and it's extremely hard to trust in someone whose only message is "trust me" when you know they're lying about who they are and they stubbornly refuse all chances to come clean.  There needs to be *some* basis for such a deep expectation of faith, and Focalors provided absolutely none.

So anyway... the way everyone acted was to me 100% realistic given the circumstances, but yeah... it was harsh.  I actually liked that the authors went there -- I think it's okay for them to make us uncomfortable at times, as sometimes being the bad guy in pursuit of the greater good is a fact of life -- but yeah, I can see how it'd be a controversial choice.
    >This seems to be the major reason CN social platforms are trash talking the story of this patch from what I've seen  
>  
>Edit: One of the major reasons. Another is that some believe that Furina deserves a much better ending, pointing out "Even Scara gets a better ending when he most certainly is even more sinned"

Do you happen to know if that's the general CN consensus on the story or would this be more similar to like going to twitter and picking out a random tweet about the story? (Not that i'm doubting you just curious). I'm interested to know how the other communities are taking the story, would be nice to see if you had any more info/summary
        At the very least that's the consensus **of those who hold negative opinions towards hoyo/genshin, including disheartened players whom they quoted.** Of those I seen that is. (Animosity towards hoyo is rather common in a few other communities I browse)

I've yet to hear voices from rather pro-Genshin communities like Bilibili content creators for example, to be perfectly honest, and I assume they're busy indulged/analyzing and haven't bothered to counterargument yet, if they intend to do that at all.
            I see, thanks for satisfying my curiosity! I did see your second edit too which helps puts thing into perspective.

Can't say I completely disagree with the "some believe that Furina deserves a much better ending, pointing out "Even Scara gets a better ending when he most certainly is even more sinned"" part, >!it did feel like Furina herself (Not focalors) was kinda forgotten at the end of the AQ. We didn't even get to see her off :( But I guess after what happened it makes sense she probably didn't want to see anyone!<
I mean, it does fit since she's a celebrity as well, it's like when celebrities/famous people in general IRL get exposed for some shit that should be otherwise just a small thing but got blown up out of proportion.

Barely anyone knows about Scaramouche's existence and Ei... well majority of Inazumans still revere her and Inazuma was based off the era in where the rulers had absolute say in things and were pretty much seen as divine beings, except in this case their ruler was a literal God, and the one that protects them at that + it was only a small part of Inazuma's population rebelling against her. 

Furina's case does feel the most human, which could be why we feel that she got too much hate but in reality, things would not be far off from what occured in game. Hell, it'd probably be worse lmao
    > Furina's case does feel the most human

I mean, yeah -- this is literally it.  Furina, as a "human," had to face the human consequences for Focalors' decision.  From their points of view, Furina herself was lying to them for 500 years to believe in her as their god when she had no powers at all (and the true god was nowhere to be seen).  Even if they may find out that she was told to do so by Focalors, and know objectively that she was doing it for their own good, it doesn't soothe the pain of betrayal, and she is the "face" of it all.  Is it a totally logical reaction?  No, of course not.  But especially in places like Poisson where the pain is fresh, it's not going to stop people from playing this sort of "what if" even if it's unreasonable.

I mean, if they truly sat down and thought about it, what were they going to do even if she *had* told them all along she was no god?  Could they have predicted it?  Would someone else really have been able to solve it and prevent it from happening?  It's completely illogical, but right now they need someone to blame, and Furina's betrayal gives them an easy scapegoat.

People may not be able to fathom the will of the gods, and may not understand why any tragedies are allowed to happen if the gods are really all-powerful beings.  I'm sure many in Watatsumi to this day still consider the Shogun's actions to by inexplicable (since they basically are, by human standards).  But people can understand when a human lies to them, no faith required.
I think this is more a testament to how far they've come in terms of writing quality since Inazuma's absolute dumpster fire of an AQ and story quests till recently. Inazuma's archon quest at this point needs a full-on rehaul at some point in the future cause anything related to it sticks out in an extremely ugly fashion now.
I think the problem is seeing bad things happening to characters as "punishment". Furina is a tragic and impactful figure *because* she doesn't deserve the things that happen to her. If she did, it would no longer be a tragedy. Not that I'm comparing the level of writing quality, but you wouldn't go up to Shakespeare and be like wow I think you did Romeo and Juliet dirty, don't you think their fighting families deserve to be punished instead of them? The emotional core of the story is that yes, indeed, Romeo and Juliet did not deserve that.
The finale really bumped it up for me and none of the quest throughout felt meaningless. They also technically improved it further through Beisht and Chasm. I think Liyue is the only one so far to see continuation after its original chapter.
Liyue's finale is still one of the best moments in the game.
I mean compared to Inazum which was basically 70% worthless build up to an under cooked finale. Liyue doesn't seem that bad im comparison... As for Mondstadt I find it on par with Liyue.
    Inazuma was mishandled but it wasn't until then where I fell in love with the story. I'd say liyue was my least favorite and mondstat only better for nostalgia reason, but that's just my opinion
Sure that ‚Äúcould‚Äù happen in the future, but as of right now it feels like we just say ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs done is done‚Äù and dont even wonder whether we can save them with Neuvillette‚Äôs power. And it‚Äôs exactly because they aren‚Äôt truly dead that it is annoying. If they are actually just dead, then yeah we can‚Äôt bring the dead back to life, but they aren‚Äôt and the traveler and Neuvillette knows that
Honestly Furina playing the act of a GOD for HUNDREDS OF YEARS is one of the most impressive feats any character has done in Genshin. The amount of will power and resilience to pull of something like that is absurd and makes her one of my Favourite characters in the Game so far, the fact she did it for selfless reasons aswell. she did what most never could dream of doing. She deserves her rest.
Eh, I remember a lot of people shitting on 2.1 right out the gate, even though they did love some sections of it. Signora‚Äôs death was wildly controversial and a lot of people felt as if Raiden got off lightly, not to mention the info dump at the end and Scaramouche‚Äôs casual drive by where he did fuck all except bully the traveler, grab the gnosis, and gtfo‚Äôd

The one part people were defending in 2.1 was Raiden getting away Scott free with insane levels of neglect and letting the Commissions and her Puppet Daughter nearly drive the country to ruin from greed from the Commissions and Apathy from the Shogunator.
No, I mean like, it was so short. You get one phase of the whale where you try it hit it as it flops around, then you randomly go fight the guy inside, and then it just ends. No second whale phase, it just cuts straight to >!Skirk casually yeeting it out of existence then everyone in Fontaine ‚Äúdrowning‚Äù.!< After doing the weekly boss version, I don‚Äôt see why they can‚Äôt let us do phase 2 in the story as well? We did it for Raiden, Scaramouche, Signora. We even beat up Dvalin all the way.

Idk for the big weekly boss of the whole chapter I was expecting more significance in the story. It was there, and then it was gone.
    The story quest especially Archon quest bosses need to be accessible for everyone, so the difficulty and length will not be hard. The first Childe boss when it was dropped was actually a bit challenging but large portions of the player base complained and said they were stuck and can't progress the story. 

So the devs need to consider the overall player base and the ability for people of varying character investment, skill level etc to progress the story. The domain version should be a bit harder.
        They added an option to decrease domain difficulty for story bosses with this update.

Alternatively, massively nerf the HP pool and mechanics and keep the phases, like they‚Äôve done with all the previous weekly bosses. Neuvillette will also heal you if your character dies (I think, my Charlotte died and magically revived with full HP at one point).

I don‚Äôt mind the boss being way easier or shorter for story mode. I just feel a story boss should showcase the complete fight and not stop halfway. It feels like if Apep ended with the turret protection phase, or Scaramouche ends once you hit him with the special action. I was ready to wack the whale, and then it just ended.
    To be far, when you finish Fontaine, you already powerful and have vast of OP characters under your belt with full set and proper team building and strategies. 

 Imagine you only has Mona and 4 stars units, your relics are still green, vapor team and fight against pre nerf Childe. I did.
> Furina acting for a long time, in the end, she wasn't really acknowledged for her effort

Umm no read Neuv's line about Furina
but then why bother with egeria's plan....
Okay, let‚Äôs subvert tropes. Next time a male exists to elevate a female in this story
Furina is trapped into her role as an archon, Nahida was trapped because she did not "fit" her role as an archon.

Are there divine beings therapists in Teyvat?
    That's the job of the Traveller. üòÖ
        They give therapy sessions to intercelstial beings in exchange for only a couple of sentences worth lead on their sibling. What a chad.
    Venti?
        Venti is a drunkard, like literally drinking his "traumas" away, we don't need baby Furina and Nahida following in his footsteps
Oohh they would be best friends. Furina would go well as Wanderer's sister.
Honestly furina is one of the few archons that are not really tied to their nation like nahida and ei so im hoping they give this girl all the screentime
That's the thing, no one knows. Only Neuvillete and the Traveler really know what she went through. For the people of Fontaine, Furina just stepped down, not dying because Neuvillete took pity on her.
Fuck it, give her a permanent residence in the teapot. Make it canon.
    No. She's been trapped long enough. Let her live her life for once
        Vacation home in the teapot
I have no mouth, but I must scream
Cyno please
Cyno, this isn't the right time

*screenshots the joke*
Sadly her story quest turned into typical genshin quest for the most part with some really good Furina moments. Those moments are good enough to like it but I wish it focused some more on the effects of the AQ on Furina. Here's hoping for a banger 2nd story quest
    I liked the quest, surely its not the neuvillette story quest but i think it fits her current state, now that she is human she lives more normal things and can be more free on her decicions.

But i wonder if she or neuvillette would be recieving a second story for the next weekly boss.
        I do appreciate exploring her human side but going straight to the story quest after the aq was a huge jump from Furina breaking down and then watching as her nation gets flooded but actually things are fine straight to Furina already breaking her rule about not doing performance arts and being fairly light hearted.

Sure, this could be a testament to her strong will but I just wish her SQ1 expanded more on her moving out, maybe having Traveler apologize for tricking her, and even maybe letting Furina confide in them and letting it all out. It would be p cool for the current sq1 to actually have been her sq2 to signal her growth and ability to move on perhaps.

Still, it was a good sq with a banger song at the end and the whole thing serves to even further show Furina's iron will due to how quickly she got back on her feet after something so traumatizing. I'm just pondering.
I am done with her story quest, and I'm quite happy to see her doing fine as a human being, also the moment she got her vision made me happy too, but now I have this doubt about how she got the vision(maybe she is too ambitious about acting )
    Hydro visions are for people that fill a role they believe in even if its not who they really are. Out a principle or belief its the right thing to do. Its less ambition and more a sense of duty. I wanna say her getting the vision right then was because she made the decision to step up even if its painful to herself.
        You're right, She also mentioned this in her voice line 'about the vision'.
    I havent played that quest yet and will only be able to tomorrow, can u tell me if her quest is set after or before act 5?
        It is set after act 5!
I think they did that pretty effectively via the subjects she was meeting all being from the same bloodline (talking about how her grandma 20 generations back idolized her)
    yeah i get that, but im more meaning about seeing her reaction to the length of time. we see her reactions to the first week, then jump to 500 years. wouldve been great to see her in her room 10 years later realizing "holy fuck"
        It just meant that it took 500 years to finally make her breakdown which shows her willpower. She was even smiling while tears flowing from her even making excuses.
holy celestia
Gently huh
Also the Abyss is the Second Who Came, which would have to make Celestia the first.
    The abyssal realm has always existed in Teyvat.

The dragons were the light realm and the abyss was the void realm.
I'm going to have to revisit that conversation
current day Fontaine is indeed quite strong but in the early days (100 years into the 500 year plan for example) we don't know how powerful Fontaine was. A rogue evil god like Osial or his wife could have tried to conquer Fontaine (just using an example) and well...
    True, also I can't imagine how stressed the fuck out Furina would be if an Osial showed up lmao, she'd go insane
Tbf The Traveler was only doing what he thought was right at the time. He never would‚Äôve humiliated Furina if he knew the full story. Given the facts he had, it‚Äôs a reasonable conclusion that he wanted to stop a poser from giving people false hope
This is so true, they don't deserve to do that, what they needed is to apologize sincerely since it's what Furina deserved. The nerve lmao
Yes. Seriously noted that for complain
The whole Watatsumi island and Raiden's dimension should've been 2 different acts.
Inazuma actually had great themes and ideas, but it was paced really badly, probably due to COVID development or something.
    Yes. Inazuma makes me so mad because there was so much potential there. It had the chance to be something amazing.
Even Neuvillete's thoughts about his belonging in this world where quite similar to the ones Ganyu has, but the execution and depth to them is miles away. Their storytelling has improve SO MUCH.
This is so real, Inazuma was awesome to me as a regi√≥n but if only its story couldve been delivered as well as sumerus or fontaines It wouldve been the second BEST (cuz It wouldnt top fontaine for me tbh)
That's been there since the beginning. Skirk likened her master to the alchemist Gold, and Gold was responsible for the cataclysm where multiple archons died
    genuinely fair point, i guess it just feels different reading about ancient lore of a powerful alchemist, versus skirk nonchalantly being like "lol yeah he was feeding his pet whale"
I mean I know that. Traveler is basically like an amnesic space hero. It's just that in the context of the whole Fontaine arc which is more focused on solving mysteries in prisons, the opera, and the city, trying to save people from a prophesied flood, the sudden appearance of an intergalactic space monster seems out of place. Not to mention that Fontaine is mecha/steampunk-esque in design and atmosphere so I didn't expect the interdimensional narwhal tbh. They did tease the whale last patch so maybe it's just me ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Still love Act V as a whole tho üíú
    I thought it fits the whole fate theme, child Childe being the accidental trigger but later also being necessary to hold the whale off for a few weeks to finish the prophecy with the trial. And all the pieces that needed to perfectly fit for Focalor plans to work out. It also adds a whole layer of more mystery to Albedos master (she has too many names), it certainly takes powers out of this world to do what she supposedly did. If you think about it, a lot of the most impactful influence in Teyvat came from outside - the descenders being in the centre of everything. Anyways, sorry for the tangent. In my mind the space whale fits right in.
Oh. My. God. 

The resurrecting the third descender part is possible and would be amazing.
    That would be so cool. Collect all the pieces and the third descender lives again
Third Descender, aka Exodia
How about waiting for the 4th descender to collect all 7 elements and then kill it. Having ang Omni element Gnosis is crack. Hahah
im sure others have mentioned it before but act 5 is called "Incandescent Ode of Resurrection" maybe not the dragon stuff because that seems harder but the first part kinda checks out because they would have all the gnosis at the end of the next act right.
I mean, hard to say how exactly they will be used, but presumably they're planning to use their power in some way to overthrow Celestia.
Yeah , now with many AQs until today, now I think about It, that the fatui and harbingers May Not be that evil after all ( with some exceptions) 
But the abyss Organization is still kinda evil
>as misfortune

Given the context of their little chat, it felt a bit like a threat to me. Like "Oh you have so much money in your hand, would really be a pity if I had to kill you to get it."
Same. Had to stay home from school cause I was too tired to drive in the morning. It feels irresponsible to say, but it was absolutely worth it. But fuck it, it's like missing a day of school to see a midnight release Endgame or the final Harry Potter or something.
Yeah I went to bed at 1 am on a work night just so I could finish it. Worth it
Agreed. No regrets at all.
6am rn I haven't had a wink of sleep, I am so glad I held off on spoilers to witness this quest. Peak writing
    Same haven't finish the archon and character quest until 6 am. Had no sleep. Worth it.
I meant compared to previous patches where we had 2 acts. Hence the reason why I said ‚Äúonly 1 act.‚Äù
    Valid I guess. It took me roughly the same about of time to finish this one act vs the two in the last patch so I based my judgement off that
SOBBING WEEPING RN
Honestly I thought that too like maybe they counted it as our sibling getting into Teyvat first and then us which is 2 simultaneous Descenders at the same time but then I remembered, we came there just 500 years ago, the Archon wars, especially the fight between the Dragons, 1st and 2nd descender happened for who knows how long ago that it's inconceivable for our twin to be dismembered for it because the Archons already existed 2000+ years ago when the original Seven were seated, unless the Heavenly Principle did some wonky timeline shenanigans where she sent our sibling to the past to be put on the chopping block and then us in the future as some sort of spare or whatever (Paimon being sent as a tracker and sticking her to us) and then it becomes some sort of loop, I dunno
I thought our sibling belonged to this world so they couldn‚Äôt be the descender? Am I wrong?
    You're thinking of the Abyss Sibling. They are a part of this world, and because of that, they can't be our real sibling, but likely a clone with the same memories.
Finishing the AQ also >!unlocks the "about the Archons" voice lines where he also confirms this. Every one of them is about judging them and their authority as God's. He does feel bad for Buer being neglected though, a nice note!<
I see. The Withering music in Sumeru is some of my favourites musics in the game
    The Withering theme is pretty darn good.
‚ÄúSuch display of Archon power‚Äù
If zhongli can retire from being a archon but the community is still calling him one then I don't see why we can't do the same with furina.
    Because he is recognized as an Archon in authority, and we now know from Neuvillette's voice lines that Zhongli still, like all Archons (unconsciously) hands out Visions

&#x200B;

Now, handing out Visions is Neuvillette's job, not Furina's, she has no authority over Hydro

so yeah I wouldn't consider her in the same bracket as Nahida, Raiden, Venti or Zhongli
        >!He's not an Archon. The throne of the hydro archon has been destroyed by Focalor, no one will ever inherit the title of "hydro Archon" ever again. Neuvillette is the hydro sovereign. If you consider him as archon then you should also recognize Apep.!<
        Where is it stated that zhongli still hands out the visions? He doesn‚Äôt even have the gnosis anymore. Id like to know the exact quote
            Neuvillette Vision story, it explicitly says he hands out Visions now. If the other archons didn't hand them out anymore, it would have been mentioned.

&#x200B;

Even when Raiden didn't have her Gnosis for 500yrs since she gave it to Yae, people (like Fischl) still got electro visions, so logically them not having a Gnosis doesn't matter since the Archons have Authority over elements, and Furina gave her Authority to Neuvillette so he now hands out Visions despite being a Dragon Sovereign and not an Archon. No other Archon handed over Authority, so despite their lack of gnosis, they still give out visions and are archons to me, unlike Furina.

&#x200B;

Neuvillette Vision Story:

&#x200B;

"From that day on, whenever a person's wishes reached the heavens, the seven overseers of the material realm were duty-bound to grant them a gift. Though they might know nothing of who or what wish had stepped into the threshold of the sacred, the Seven Archons still had to impart a shattered shard of their mastery to that person. And when one so gifted completed their duty... the gift the gods would receiving in return would be more abundant still."

"Neuvillette obeys no edict from the heavens, but he does acknowledge human will. So he too set aside parts of himself, as like unto the dragon-treasure hoards of old, awaiting valiant humans to come and claim them."
                Seems like such an arbitrary metric to judge who the archon is. Moreover, I think you're latching on too much to inference considering we know that the raiden shogun didn't know she was handing out visions either. Whose to say zhongli/venti/raiden/nahida are still doing it? Certainly not that passage, no?

It's just you inferencing that they do it, we don't know that they still do without the gnoses. Furina is one part of focalors, the hydro archon. The game will treat her as the archon for all intents and purposes.

Then I guess, to you, the archon is just no one? because according to that exact same quote you gave it cannot be neuvilette. He doesn't obey the edict from the heavens and does it off his own will.
        they put Furina in the anniversary art this year with the rest of the Archons, maybe just to avoid spoilers but we'll get a real answer next year when they release the next anniversary art if we see Furina or Neuvilette.
Besides Zhongli himself said that the age of the gods is coming to an end. I think this aq solidified that. As Dainslief said "humans have their humanity" and it was Furina's humanity that saved Fontaine.
    Truly Cooking!!! The point of Archon quests is not to follow some formulaic pattern for each archon but progress the overall world and story progression. This archon quest progressed the weakening of archons powers, hence the end of the age of gods, and the Dain statement as mentioned above.

Also this is setting up to allow room for a new party of players, the Sovereigns to make an impact and entrance later (Natlan) and stir the story further with how Celestia, Sovereigns, Descenders, Archons, Travelers, Fatui and many some other currently unknown characters from beyond etc will connect and interact.
well, if we go by the theory that every nation has a kind of "throne" for an archon to sit on, Ei would be the successor to Makoto in filling the role.
Well, Focalors certainly wasn't going to substitute for a "companion" either way, because she's the one that put her up to this cruel responsibility in the first place.  What Furina was looking for, to be less lonely, was a friend -- someone she could confide her secret to and who could empathize with what she's going through.

I'm not necessarily suggesting they were constantly talking to each other or anything -- perhaps it's been centuries since she did any intervention at all.  But, Focalors was definitely the one who setup Neuvillette's role as part of her plan, so one way or another it was her "will" that was guiding that to happen.  Based on what we know of Furina's personality and the truth behind it all now, I would still tend to believe that somehow that was the voice of Focalors to Neuvillette coming through, and not just part of Furina's act.
Or hope to pull it off and prolong the character as long as she can, even risking her life for it.
I guess I can sort of see where you're coming from in a way, but it's because the main thought in the Traveler's head was "we need to try to stop this tragedy from occurring."  This was emphasized in the little "retrospective tour of Fontaine" while they asked everyone how they would handle the prophecy if it occurred.

At that time, they really thought that Furina's withholding the truth was potentially condemning the whole nation to death, and they couldn't at all understand why.  I think the Traveler was truly, genuinely hoping that Furina would open up to them privately before the trial so it'd all not have to happen (since they 100% legit wanted to help), and they did show that the Traveler was sad that it came to that.  And then, when meeting with Furina later on the stage, they still had that in the back of their mind: I need to figure out the missing piece of the puzzle so we can save Fontaine.  Keep in mind, all this time they've been forced to play this "detective" role, they've gotten the hint from N that it's possible to change fate a bit, and they think tons of lives are at stake.  (They also aren't seeing what Neuvillette is seeing, which we had partly seen.)  At the end when Furina reveals that she can't tell them, and reveals all her deeply personal reasons why, the Traveler can only accept her decision.  It's absolutely tragic, but it also doesn't get them closer to solving the problem.

In the end, I think it's really the difference between us in the audience and the Traveler as one player on the stage of fate.  In this case, the Traveler doesn't really fully represent us in the audience -- we can be full-on sympathetic to Furina because we know that one way or another we will end up fighting the boss and the day will be saved.  (You know everyone in Fontaine is not going to die because they just announced Navia as a character coming in 4.3, for instance!)  But the Traveler is living in the moment with the weight of the world on their shoulders.  No matter the obvious tragedy of Furina's life and all she went through, you can't really weigh it against the tragedy prophesized to unfold over all of Fontaine.  The Traveler was really not in quite the right state of mind to whole-heartedly sympathize with Furina in that moment.  Maybe they could have done a bit more to make that a bit more clear, but I did think it was there.

Definitely enjoy the character quest.  I think it should be considered "required reading" for sure.
It was definitely a gut-punch to me as a player; it legit made me feel like a bad guy in the moment, putting her so obviously through more pain.  But, yeah, from everyone's point of view in-game, they were desperate to try to save Fontaine, and it's extremely hard to trust in someone whose only message is "trust me" when you know they're lying about who they are and they stubbornly refuse all chances to come clean.  There needs to be *some* basis for such a deep expectation of faith, and Focalors provided absolutely none.

So anyway... the way everyone acted was to me 100% realistic given the circumstances, but yeah... it was harsh.  I actually liked that the authors went there -- I think it's okay for them to make us uncomfortable at times, as sometimes being the bad guy in pursuit of the greater good is a fact of life -- but yeah, I can see how it'd be a controversial choice.
>This seems to be the major reason CN social platforms are trash talking the story of this patch from what I've seen  
>  
>Edit: One of the major reasons. Another is that some believe that Furina deserves a much better ending, pointing out "Even Scara gets a better ending when he most certainly is even more sinned"

Do you happen to know if that's the general CN consensus on the story or would this be more similar to like going to twitter and picking out a random tweet about the story? (Not that i'm doubting you just curious). I'm interested to know how the other communities are taking the story, would be nice to see if you had any more info/summary
    At the very least that's the consensus **of those who hold negative opinions towards hoyo/genshin, including disheartened players whom they quoted.** Of those I seen that is. (Animosity towards hoyo is rather common in a few other communities I browse)

I've yet to hear voices from rather pro-Genshin communities like Bilibili content creators for example, to be perfectly honest, and I assume they're busy indulged/analyzing and haven't bothered to counterargument yet, if they intend to do that at all.
        I see, thanks for satisfying my curiosity! I did see your second edit too which helps puts thing into perspective.

Can't say I completely disagree with the "some believe that Furina deserves a much better ending, pointing out "Even Scara gets a better ending when he most certainly is even more sinned"" part, >!it did feel like Furina herself (Not focalors) was kinda forgotten at the end of the AQ. We didn't even get to see her off :( But I guess after what happened it makes sense she probably didn't want to see anyone!<
> Furina's case does feel the most human

I mean, yeah -- this is literally it.  Furina, as a "human," had to face the human consequences for Focalors' decision.  From their points of view, Furina herself was lying to them for 500 years to believe in her as their god when she had no powers at all (and the true god was nowhere to be seen).  Even if they may find out that she was told to do so by Focalors, and know objectively that she was doing it for their own good, it doesn't soothe the pain of betrayal, and she is the "face" of it all.  Is it a totally logical reaction?  No, of course not.  But especially in places like Poisson where the pain is fresh, it's not going to stop people from playing this sort of "what if" even if it's unreasonable.

I mean, if they truly sat down and thought about it, what were they going to do even if she *had* told them all along she was no god?  Could they have predicted it?  Would someone else really have been able to solve it and prevent it from happening?  It's completely illogical, but right now they need someone to blame, and Furina's betrayal gives them an easy scapegoat.

People may not be able to fathom the will of the gods, and may not understand why any tragedies are allowed to happen if the gods are really all-powerful beings.  I'm sure many in Watatsumi to this day still consider the Shogun's actions to by inexplicable (since they basically are, by human standards).  But people can understand when a human lies to them, no faith required.
Inazuma was mishandled but it wasn't until then where I fell in love with the story. I'd say liyue was my least favorite and mondstat only better for nostalgia reason, but that's just my opinion
The story quest especially Archon quest bosses need to be accessible for everyone, so the difficulty and length will not be hard. The first Childe boss when it was dropped was actually a bit challenging but large portions of the player base complained and said they were stuck and can't progress the story. 

So the devs need to consider the overall player base and the ability for people of varying character investment, skill level etc to progress the story. The domain version should be a bit harder.
    They added an option to decrease domain difficulty for story bosses with this update.

Alternatively, massively nerf the HP pool and mechanics and keep the phases, like they‚Äôve done with all the previous weekly bosses. Neuvillette will also heal you if your character dies (I think, my Charlotte died and magically revived with full HP at one point).

I don‚Äôt mind the boss being way easier or shorter for story mode. I just feel a story boss should showcase the complete fight and not stop halfway. It feels like if Apep ended with the turret protection phase, or Scaramouche ends once you hit him with the special action. I was ready to wack the whale, and then it just ended.
To be far, when you finish Fontaine, you already powerful and have vast of OP characters under your belt with full set and proper team building and strategies. 

 Imagine you only has Mona and 4 stars units, your relics are still green, vapor team and fight against pre nerf Childe. I did.
That's the job of the Traveller. üòÖ
    They give therapy sessions to intercelstial beings in exchange for only a couple of sentences worth lead on their sibling. What a chad.
Venti?
    Venti is a drunkard, like literally drinking his "traumas" away, we don't need baby Furina and Nahida following in his footsteps
No. She's been trapped long enough. Let her live her life for once
    Vacation home in the teapot
I liked the quest, surely its not the neuvillette story quest but i think it fits her current state, now that she is human she lives more normal things and can be more free on her decicions.

But i wonder if she or neuvillette would be recieving a second story for the next weekly boss.
    I do appreciate exploring her human side but going straight to the story quest after the aq was a huge jump from Furina breaking down and then watching as her nation gets flooded but actually things are fine straight to Furina already breaking her rule about not doing performance arts and being fairly light hearted.

Sure, this could be a testament to her strong will but I just wish her SQ1 expanded more on her moving out, maybe having Traveler apologize for tricking her, and even maybe letting Furina confide in them and letting it all out. It would be p cool for the current sq1 to actually have been her sq2 to signal her growth and ability to move on perhaps.

Still, it was a good sq with a banger song at the end and the whole thing serves to even further show Furina's iron will due to how quickly she got back on her feet after something so traumatizing. I'm just pondering.
Hydro visions are for people that fill a role they believe in even if its not who they really are. Out a principle or belief its the right thing to do. Its less ambition and more a sense of duty. I wanna say her getting the vision right then was because she made the decision to step up even if its painful to herself.
    You're right, She also mentioned this in her voice line 'about the vision'.
I havent played that quest yet and will only be able to tomorrow, can u tell me if her quest is set after or before act 5?
    It is set after act 5!
yeah i get that, but im more meaning about seeing her reaction to the length of time. we see her reactions to the first week, then jump to 500 years. wouldve been great to see her in her room 10 years later realizing "holy fuck"
    It just meant that it took 500 years to finally make her breakdown which shows her willpower. She was even smiling while tears flowing from her even making excuses.
The abyssal realm has always existed in Teyvat.

The dragons were the light realm and the abyss was the void realm.
True, also I can't imagine how stressed the fuck out Furina would be if an Osial showed up lmao, she'd go insane
Yes. Inazuma makes me so mad because there was so much potential there. It had the chance to be something amazing.

That would be so cool. Collect all the pieces and the third descender lives again

Can't say I completely disagree with the "some believe that Furina deserves a much better ending, pointing out "Even Scara gets a better ending when he most certainly is even more sinned"" part, >!it did feel like Furina herself (Not focalors) was kinda forgotten at the end of the AQ. We didn't even get to see her off :( But I guess after what happened it makes sense she probably didn't want to see anyone!<
Neuvillette Vision story, it explicitly says he hands out Visions now. If the other archons didn't hand them out anymore, it would have been mentioned.

Even when Raiden didn't have her Gnosis for 500yrs since she gave it to Yae, people (like Fischl) still got electro visions, so logically them not having a Gnosis doesn't matter since the Archons have Authority over elements, and Furina gave her Authority to Neuvillette so he now hands out Visions despite being a Dragon Sovereign and not an Archon. No other Archon handed over Authority, so despite their lack of gnosis, they still give out visions and are archons to me, unlike Furina.

Neuvillette Vision Story:

&#x200B;

"From that day on, whenever a person's wishes reached the heavens, the seven overseers of the material realm were duty-bound to grant them a gift. Though they might know nothing of who or what wish had stepped into the threshold of the sacred, the Seven Archons still had to impart a shattered shard of their mastery to that person. And when one so gifted completed their duty... the gift the gods would receiving in return would be more abundant still."

"Neuvillette obeys no edict from the heavens, but he does acknowledge human will. So he too set aside parts of himself, as like unto the dragon-treasure hoards of old, awaiting valiant humans to come and claim them."
    Seems like such an arbitrary metric to judge who the archon is. Moreover, I think you're latching on too much to inference considering we know that the raiden shogun didn't know she was handing out visions either. Whose to say zhongli/venti/raiden/nahida are still doing it? Certainly not that passage, no?

It's just you inferencing that they do it, we don't know that they still do without the gnoses. Furina is one part of focalors, the hydro archon. The game will treat her as the archon for all intents and purposes.

Then I guess, to you, the archon is just no one? because according to that exact same quote you gave it cannot be neuvilette. He doesn't obey the edict from the heavens and does it off his own will.
