[[Reminder that Ganyu is over 3000 years old]]


I really hope in a cutscene Ganyu is eventually able to talk more about her experiences being one of the oldest playable characters.

Admittedly It does upset me a little that she typically talks about work and how much there is to do. Like girl, your work isn't your life, tell me about yourself 💅


That's why Cloud Retainer is here. She'll tell us all about baby Ganyu.
    "Ah, one recalls when Ganyu was but a small child. One remembers her plump as a ball..."

Next day: "You're getting fat."

        The fat shaming never fails to be funny
            It's very Asian
                It is very "world culture"
            I'm not sure if that's fat-shaming and more just, like, objectively stating with affection that she was a large child and Paimon laughing at Ganyu's embarrassment.

Fat-shaming would be more like "One remembers when you were a fat kid, thank Stone-God that you lost all that weight".

    I get the odd feeling that she'll soon be telling us a lot more
        i guess we can only dream
            We'll know for sure when the drip marketing for 4.4 drops.
        Her voice lines in the menu be all about that dumpling ganyu
    Plump she was back then
    Cloud Retainer, pulling out a cardboard box: “Good thing she didn't pull the secret string, opening the secret compartment of my secret box revealing one embarrassing snapshot of Ganyu at that Christmas Party!”
    Cloud Retainer will be the best girl, Mark my words
        Hell yeah
    Hopefully Ganyu will not interrupt Cloudie again
She’s also one of the first adepti that helped Zhongli during the Archon War
    Yes! I wish there was some additional story emphasizing how Ganyu fought during the Archon War and has been actively helping Liyue Harbor since it’s founding. But, it’s usually always story about the other adepti or Yaksha.

Two fanfics I would like to recommend that play with some cool ideas about Ganyu:
>[Tianming](https://archiveofourown.org/works/28531878) plays with the idea that Ganyu was the assassin/defender of the Harbor and silenced any enemies/detractors of Rex Lapis within the city.

>[Everfrost](https://archiveofourown.org/works/38732049) is a Liyue Archon Quest AU where Ganyu goes on a rampage hunting down those responsible for Rex Lapis’s ‘death’ and any threats to the Harbor (Spoiler: Childe becomes hamburger, Signora becomes a popsicle)
        Bro I just read everfrost and holy shit, it was cool (intended)
    I believe that was actually Ganyu's mom, not Ganyu herself. Ganyu entered the fold later
        Zhongli about Ganyu:

>Liyue's prosperity has not been merely built on Rex Lapis' oracles or wisdom. It is also thanks to the countless servants of the Geo Archon who have honored their end of the contract. Of them, ***Ganyu is the one who has served for the longest time*****.** If you want to know about her past... You should ask her about it. I fear my wording would not be delicate enough to receive her approval.

From Ganyu's vision story:

>Qilin are paragons of benevolence among the adepti, drinking only freshwater and eating only plants. Flies they will not hurt, and a bruised reed they will not break. They do not travel abroad, do not gather in herds, and no trap will hold them. They are leisurely yet composed, active but reserved — a gentle and elegant race. Yet when a wicked beast from the sea arose and threatened the land beneath their feet, that peaceful life ceased to be an option. ***Three thousand years ago, Ganyu answered the call of Morax the God of Geo, aiding him in the Archon Wars.***

She also met Guizhong a couple of times, it is very unlikely to be about her mom given that we know pretty much nothing about her and Cloud Retainer talks about Ganyu like she's been in her care since she was a baby.
            I don’t know too much about the lore but serving the longest doesn’t mean the first. For example if the first quit after 2500 years.
                Editors note: quit means died in action.
                    Adepti Never Die, they only go missing in action

                    KIA
                I like how we're making shit up though.

Like where did OP even get the idea that Ganyu's mom served in the war as one of the first?

What happened to the 5 great adepti with Xiao? Though Xiao had to be rescued during the war so he couldn't really be one of the first ones. And when did Cloud Retainer, Mountain Shaper, Aloof 4-legs, and Ping join?

Where did Ganyu's mom come into any of this?
            Has Ganyu met Guizhong? What did they talk about? Which lore talks about it??
                I don’t recall them talking about anything, Ganyu mentioned meeting Guizhong during this year’s lantern rite
        I think it's unlikely to be Ganyu's mom. 

We know essentially nothing about her, the only thing we have is a story of a Qilin eating some dude's clothes and having sexy time with him as an apology, then she abandoned the baby to him?

We don't have a name, nor what she did beyond giving birth to Ganyu. Hell, if we don't take that story as being about specifically Ganyu's parents then we don't even know if the mom was the Qilin or not.

So, showing a character we know so little of during the fall of the Guili Assembly and not even mentioning her seems weird to me. But if it was Ganyu not mentioning anything would make sense, it would be unnecessary.
            I didn't realize we even knew that much.
            I hadn't heard about the story about the Qilin leaving a child with someone, but I believe the Qilin in that one animated cutscene was Ganyu's mom since I don't think Ganyu is able to take a Qilin form floating around like that, that cutscene has humans and all the adepti in that cutscene were in their animal forms. So with the art direction of that cutscene, I feel like if that was Ganyu in it she would've been depicted as more human.

Besides, Genshin isn't foreign to the idea of introducing something or someone then just not mentioning anything until years later
                >I don't think Ganyu is able to take a Qilin form floating around like that

why not?
                    Half adepti are closer to human than full adepti. For example, iirc Yanfei stated she couldn't do sub-space creation, and half adepti need a vision to control the element. In this regard, half adepti are just like regular humans. So it makes sense to assume that they don't possess full beast form either
                        Half adepti have powers that don't include a vision though. That includes Yanfei and Ganyu. For game purposes they have visions and elements that we use explicitly though.

The lore calls out how they do not need visions period to tap into their powers. And yanfei is a very new adepti, so new that her human parent is still alive.
                            Yes and no. 

They do have Adepti aura and stuffs but they don't have insane ability like shape shifting. If they do, then Ganyu wouldn't have had to control her eating habits just to control the size of her waistline lol.

The natural abilities of Half Adepti are just not to the extent of the full Adepti. 

In Ganyu's vision story, getting her vision was said to be a significant power boost for her. They're not just decorations to fit in the human society like Xiao's Vision. Age doesn't play a big role either. I mean Xiao's younger than Ganyu and yet his abilities are far stronger than Ganyu's
                I agree that half adepti, like Ganyu and Yanfei, does not possess any beast form, but that doesn't mean that Qilin was Ganyu's mom. It is possible, though, but talking about headcannon like it's a fact will just set you up for disappointment
        She was the one that choked someone to death though so she's definitely there.
            But not that monster

May they rest in paimon
            I think a monster tried swallowing her and her hips were so wide it choked to death
                Stop this nonsense, my ganyu was a fat plump baby, the monster choke on her waist not hips. She's so fat and round that she can roll down the mountain like a ball! - cloud retainer
        where do people keep pulling ganyu's mom from? as far as we know, her only mother figure is cloud retainer
            People have parents, she's half-human half-adepti, so Ganyu has parents, she didn't come from nowhere after all. But Cloud Retainer is her current parent
        Read Zhongli’s voiceline about her. Literally says Ganyu’s the one that’s worked with him the longest. So yes she’s the first.
            The longest does not equal the first.

Doesn't Azdaha predate Ganyu's 3000 years for example? Won't be the longest simply because, ahemm, they split ways.
                I think he's older than Zhongli, Morax just unearthed him
            There could be others who simply aren’t with him anymore. Maybe they died or went their separate ways, but Ganyu hasn’t, yet. Hence her being the longest, but not the first.
        We don’t have enough information about Qilin.Don’t forget Zhongli also has Qilin parent(s).
            Hnm, what? One of Zhongli's forms is a mix between a dragon and a qilin, but 1) we don't know if that's his true form, we only know that he can "shed" that skin like snakes do, 2) we don't even know if he was born like a normal being, he could have just been born out of the existence from all we know.

The current lore we know is that *some* gods *might* have been born out of Phanes fragments after the war with the Second Who Came. But since Venti was a Wind Spirit, Zhongli could still be from a completely different origin.
                I wonder what is the origin of makoto and ei,were they also youkai?
    And she's among the few to not know Zhongli is Rex Lapis. Which I find hilarious.
        Remember last year's Lantern Rite? She already knew
            Really? I don't remember
Unfortunately for her, the writers wrote her such that her work IS indeed her life, and didn't add much else barring some Cloud Retainer fluff which makes for a dry ass character
    Ganuy is one of these characters with the most interesting backstories that you know will never be explored because the Devs gave her a mind-blowing.... three character traits. And only one is slightly related to her backstory. She likes food but feels guilty for eating, she is a workaholic and she feels like she doesn't fit in.
        Honestly, i kinda like that, A character that lived for 3000 years, joined a war with gods and probably more wars after that is now living a relatively peaceful life being a workaholic, worrying about the little things in life. Shes took the complete opposite route of xiao, dude still fights demons without rest after so long, after losing so many loved once, even though its his nature im pretty sure he can live life a lil which what ganyu is doing imo. Writen at 3am and my heads hurting, hope that mad sense, prob not lol
            The 3 am essay, a classic. 



Yeah makes sense mate, ig there's appeal to be found in her simplicity
                Its legit 3am 😭 welcome to east asia and the time where i doom scroll on reddit cuz haha yes
                    I get it man, I really do, happy scrolling until you pass out mate
                        Prob gonna hapen in a few mins lmao
            That honestly is a good way to put it, it makes me like ganyu a bit more as a character, however I do think we can learn more about her life and personality a bit more.
        The number of character traits isn't the problem here. Any playable character could probably be summarized like that. The problem is that they don't and most probably won't do anything interesting with her. She's supposed to be a cute, overworked girl and that's it. She won't have any character arc where her past becomes relevant and she undergoes some development, which is the case for almost every character in Genshin.
        She's also vegetarian but invites Traveler to fish with her in birthday mail.
            Catch n release ftw
                I'm not sure Ganyu would be into hurting fish for fun.
                    I assume she heals the fish? Or maybe special adeptus fishing rods XD
            there do be mekafish in Fontaine
        Given enough time, these three traits could be amazingly expanded upon
    I don't know if it's Unfortunate cause it's clearly intentional

Ganyu is someone who works a lot and seems to enjoy working for the most part. I also think it might be intentional for her.

If she's always working she's not on personal time and not forming relationships in that personal time, relationships that will only cause her pain as she outlives nearly every person she's ever met.

The more she works the less personal time for relationships she has, the less personal relationships she has the less she'll be hurt when that person grows old and dies.

It's also clear from her story Cutscene that Ganyu does not like having free time because when she does her mind inevitable drifts back to the fact "You don't belong in this society, you are an other and everyone here you care about will die while you keep on living without them"

I don't think Ganyu being a worker bee is unfortunate, I think it's either used to inform or based on some of her characters core wants, needs and fears
    shout to genshin devs for being allergic to consistently good writing
I also kind of hate how Ganyu and Xiao act like their barely know each other when they’ve been protecting Liyue together for thousands of years and they are both basically two of Rex Lapis’s top lieutenants. Like, they should be friends.
    That’s more on Xiao than anything. The traveler is literally the only person he reluctantly associates with.
        In one of his birthday messages he went to visit another Adepti to just talk and they started panicking because they thought someone horrible had happened, otherwise Xiao wouldn't have come.

&#x200B;

So yeah, Xiao is just really anti-social, to the point that him showing up is reason to panic.
            I wonder if Xiao could have avoided being afflicted with the karmic residues of dead gods... if he had simply shot enemies from 1km away like Ganyu's cryo sniper bow
                Maybe? Either that or everything gives off the same amount of Karmic debt, and Ganyu was just doing big game hunting while he was wiping out armies.
                    This is a Dottore-tier experiement

"Does physical distance affect accumulation of bad karmic from killing dead gods?"

*Forces Collei to shank Orobashi's corpse*
                        Well it's got to be quantity or distance. Or Xiao did alot of kill stealing.
            The real lore is in the birthday messages
        What if Ganyu attempted to get close to Xiao in the past and just gave up after the 50th attempt
            Iirc her voiceline about him implies she doesnt want to.

" I can understand that, to be honest, but I'm not really about to try and get close to him. I mean... all the people he's ever agreed to team up with are no longer with us..."
                oof my mans a walking death flag
                    Bennett but worse 😭
                IIRC this is also a weird EN translation. In the JP and CN versions she rather means to say: "I'd like to but he's been through so much, I don't know how to approach him".
                Traveler foreshadowing 💀
                His main team was that adepti team that went to the abyss and lost their minds and he would have died too if Venti didn't swoop in and manhandle Xiao's sweet ass, because what was Zhongli doing??

Thankfully Zhongli learned his lesson about Xiao's sweet ass and saved that ass in present time when Xiao was about to make the SAME MISTAKE TWICE...oh wait Zhongli was really there to save Yelan lmao.
                    Dunno if you're memeing but Xiao's team didnt go in the abyss it was only one of them (and it wasnt even the abyss but the chasm) and Venti didnt "swoop in to save Xiao" he just carried the song of his flute with the wind
            That's what happened in her story quest though in a training form. I wish we could see them interacting more. 

I think this was more on Xiao than Ganyu.
        Isn't that because of Xiao's curse or something? He can't be around people unless they have crazy energy like Traveller or Zhongli.
        Hu Tao too, now
            Don't forget your favorite drunk bard too
    It kind of makes sense since Xiao's work involves many backdoor stuff that Rex Lapis wouldn't want the common people or anyone else to know. Also Xiao purposely isolates himself from others so that he won't endanger them.
        Phrasing!
    Xiao is the black ops of zhongli, he may be kinda distant from the rest of the adepti
    Xiao doesn’t talk to *anybody.* Also he’s active across Liyue, rarely going near Liyue Harbour, and Ganyu is always in Liyue Harbour.
she certainly doesn't act like it
    Yea, that's the odd part. Sometimes I think the writers may have accidentally wrote themselves into a corner with making someone like Ganyu be one of the older playable characters, considering how outstandingly wise and seasoned all the other hundreds of year old characters are. Meanwhile outside of her work, Ganyu seems pretty unseasoned
        She's been living with internal anxiety of not fitting into either side of society.

On adepti side she's only a half so she feels inferior, while on human side she live too long to really feel like she's part of them when she's seen multiple generations of a family come and gone.

Didn't help that until the end of AQ adepti and humans were basically segregated.

She isn't some wise being with 3000 years of studying the world, she's a (archon) war veteran with depression and sense of isolation shoving herself into work because it's the one thing she doesn't feel sadge about (there's also food, but the resulting weight gain will make her sadge)
            Even considering that, the strange thing is that she gives the impression that she's still young. I don't think her feelings of not being able to fit in would stunt her to this degree, with that age she would still have an understanding of the world better than most 

That's why by default most of Genshin's characters that are hundreds of years old are written to be seasoned and rich in experience overall, except for one but that was a special case
                to be fair, most of our interactions with Ganyu includes Cloud Retainer/ other adepti (who are considered older)

in comparison, her interactions with other humans feels normal and doesn’t really young-ify Ganyu
                    Actually Ganyu's friendship with that one Qixing fishing guy seriously makes Ganyu seem rather young, I would say this about a good portion of her interactions with humans. Then there's comparing Ganyu to many other human playable characters who, in comparison to Ganyu outside her work, seem equally or more experienced than her with life.
        It’s hard to write a proper long-living character.Night elf in WOW surely lives very longer than general races, but they are not obviously stronger or smarter.
            frieren exist
[removed]
    They mention this in genshin where long-life characters fall suspect to "erosion". It's why Raiden made the Raiden Shogun.
    Yeah, god-like minds are different from human minds. It's why immortality was the punishment dished out upon Khaenrian nobility by Celestia, Celestia knows it's creations well enough to understand that it's torture for most humans
    The last human we saw live for 500 years suffered a ton of mental trauma, and she definitely needs a hug afterwards.
        She gets all the hugs everyday. She’s permanently on my overworld team, with Kirara as her emotional support kitty.
        A hug and all the love and affection in the world
    >going insane from boredom or grief at continuously watching your loved ones die.

An argument that wouldn't hold in modern times. There's so much information that you have an endless stream of things to do to avoid boredom. So much to learn and so much entertainment to consume. The loved ones part depends on each person. If you just don't have any loved ones, outliving people means little.
        > If you just don't have any loved ones, outliving people means little.

Humans are, primarily, social beings, in the sense that we need actual interactions with other humans to remain sane. Very noticeable during the pandemic, when most of our interactions were online, but extremely important and valuable overall. A human with no built relationships with another, be it physically or digitally, will fall ill with loneliness or depression, as much as they can be antisocial. I can see some relying on building relationships with fictional beings (books, games, artists or other famous persons, OCs, etc) but I personally don't see this lasting or remaining a healthy practice in the long run.
            I mean, you can just keep people at the acquaintance level, no need to get attached to them. That way, no matter how many die, it won't deeply affect you.
                But there is a thing  
Humans need attachement
                    Pets are always a possibility.
                        This sounds sad
Always weird to think that she's around **six** times older than Yae.
3000 years of living and homegirl got nothing interesting to say. That's insane
    she’s sleepy
    Well there's uuuhh...that one time she choked a monster with her ass and...hhmmmmmm
    Genshin writing everyone
    Literally me
3 thousand is insane, even in Honkai Star Rail the oldest playable character is at most 1.5k years old (Jing Liu) and she's keeping herself from going insane every single day.
    Well the insanity Jing Liu experiences is just the mara sickness she's fading in and out of, mortal minds and bodies aren't exactly built to manage something like mara sickness
        Mara struck is not unique to humans though, Foxians who aren't immortal can also fall to it but they usually die off before getting old enough to experience it. And Ganyu is half human so she shouldn't be as well equipped as actual adepti. I always kinda assumed she was less than 1000 years old like a lot of the other long lived characters in the game, since the characters who lived longer than that has a much more ancient vibe to them (newer Archons vs older Archons).
        Affaik mara is caused by building up of excess memories and negative emotions so the longer someone live the more likely they get struck with it. I imagine if Ganyu was in HSR even if she is a half-adepti she would still suffer from some mental problems at least since she's also half-human.

But then again being that dedicated to working is already a sign of serious mental issue* 


*this message was brought to you by Qingque, your local gambling diviner
            > Affaik mara is caused by building up of excess memories and negative emotions

I still don't completely buy that. It doesn't explain why they undergo sudden rapid physical mutations. Dan Shu noted that people with incurable congenital conditions who become mara struck are inexplicably healed. We also see the downside in Bailu's quest, when a woman who is losing herself to it puts on a set of armor to disguise herself and her flesh *grows over it* in a matter of mere minutes, fusing it to her body.

Saying "they went crazy because they had too many memories" is all well and good, but fails to fully address the issue, and thus I don't really trust that explanation.
    > even in Honkai Star Rail the oldest playable character is at most 1.5k years old (Jing Liu)

Screwllum is meant to be older than Nanook
Why is Cloud Retainer, a background npc from two short sections of the Archon quests, more fleshed out and interesting than 90% of the Liyue cast?

The writers clearly cared more about the adepti of old, and Xiao's homies than the actual playable characters. Xiao, Shenhe and ZL being exceptions

And of course Yanfei and her rap career
    Well, Cloud Retainer isn't going to stay a background NPC for long.

Mountain Shaper and Moon Carver though...
    Yanfei had a rap career? Didn't you mean Hu Tao?
        
"In the far future, the law will have entered into the people's hearts. All people will be amiable, modest, and live happily in this world...

...If such a day were to arrive, she would just become a rapper."

(I skipped a lot)
            Where was it cited? I'm curious
                Character Story: Codex Finalum

Or something like that
    Genshin's writing choices are really hard to understand sometimes
Reminder that over 1000 years old creatures have the mental maturity of children in this game, however that's possible lol
    Maybe because everyone either stops mentally maturing or starts to erode. Raiden locked herself up to maintain her mental, so she acts like a child sometimes. Or Zhongli acts like he’s ancient, because he is, and he’s actively resisting erosion.
>Reminder that Ganyu is over 3000 years old  
>  
>I really hope in a cutscene Ganyu is eventually able to talk more about her experiences being one of the oldest playable characters.

1st rule for "really old characters" according to lore in anime games/shows is that none of them seems wise enough for their age, like they lived thousands of years but acts like normal teenagers/adults
    I'd argue that in Genshin that all older characters are rich in experience to a degree that it fits their age, It's just Ganyu that's the odd one out. There's another who's an odd one out, but there's an explanation for that
        Ganyu only happens to be the "old character" with the least screen time

but xiao isnt really different from her in the aspect of not looking "wise" as an old character
            Xiao is not wise, but he has demonstrated himself to be an incredibly experienced person who's shut himself off from most others due to his profession.
Annoys me that we have so many half adeptus-human hybrids and they’re just treated as if their regular people, as if the status of also being half adeptus wouldn’t alter their lives or how they perceive things. Especially after seeing furina and why it was so impressive how she did what she did. It would be nice to see how being half god and half human changes how Ganyu perceives things
    Fr, Yanfei’s dad coming back to Liyue would be a great way to get her involved in literally anything. The last major appearance she had was the cooking competition iirc and before that it was the Sereniteapot
        I think you may have forgotten the Archon Quest Interlude in the Chasm?
            Tbh, I always rope that in with the event but how could I forget about running around the caves with her?
    there is a movie called men of the eath ( or something like this) where the guy is an immortal ancient human who lived for thousand of years. The thing is that he can only experience what he lives, he only see what he see, he work to eat, he walk, he sleep, he makes friends and his friends die, he had no superpower to know more that what is around him and forget things like we forget , so he lives a normal life. Basically every adepti .
I feel like she’s suffering from some level of erosion.
    Honestly that'd actually be a good explanation as to why she never talks a lot about her past even to people she trusts, she just barely knows it. There's potential for it add a good amount to her character, to really recontextualize her
    In the archon quest where she forgets to tell us how to get to the jade chamber, definitely reminded me of that 😂
        She’s starting to get that divine Alzheimer.
Ganyu’s character potential has been wasted in the same way kokomi’s was. Instead we just focus on how overworked they are.
    It’s tragic that Kokomi and Ganyu are both my mains and my two favorite characters… and they both got the same “overworked girlie with little personality” treatment. I’m still hoping future events might flesh them out a bit more
        Same. Ganyu and Kokomi mains waiting for more content
Now i wonder if [this](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gensin-impact/images/e/e3/Illuminated_Beasts.png/revision/latest?cb=20220611044433) was her or her mother.
And still a secretary. You'd think she'd get a promotion by now.
    This is a Chinese secretary- the most important person in the communist party is the general secretary
        Ya, you can muicanize it too. We have a Secretary of State which is a high ranking official, too, which is fourth in secession for leadership. It's easy for the title "Secretary" to be seen as the common usage for a low level every like position but there are plenty of high ranking "Secretarys" as well.
        Yeah, secretary = Minister/Director.

The US uses this title ex Secretary of State = Minister of Foreign Affairs.

Ganyu is pretty high up there without being a "Public" figure.
            Is Ganyu higher or lower than Uncle Tian/Ningguang/Keqing ?
Ganyu deserves a second story quest. I love her personally, but yeah I do agree that her only story quest is generally bad (except when Cloud Retainer mentioned her past which is kinda funny). It is basically a misunderstanding where the lack of communication is the cause of all the following plain situations. The fact that irt has no cutscene makes it even worse (neither does Hu Tao but her quest is much deeper).

Look at Xiao. His quest is imo bad and later he is involved in an Archon quest where he plays a huge role.

Nevertheless, happy cake day my girl
    > it has no cutscene.  

Isn’t this the cutscene? https://youtu.be/YsQ9qrl97CM?si=yK2ZRoMEZwOPyqKJ
        Eh, technically it is. But the fact that it failed to leave me an impression that her quest DOES have one makes it bad.

Maybe it sounds a bit personal, but I want cutscene to engage the story's climax point (fighting scene like Wrio or Alhaitham, touching emotion like Yoimiya or Ayaka, or a "the character finally realizes or perceives sth" vibe like Neuvi). Ganyu's cutscene is more like an illustration of her ongoing problem which has persisted for thousands of years. Even without it, I can clearly remember what her problem is. What I don't really recall is how we were able to resolve it, at least temporarily.
Wait, Arent zhongli and raiden shogun oldest playable characters?
    Zhongli is ~6000, Venti is 3000+. We don't know how old Raiden is, other than also being at least around 3000 (we also don't know when the Archon War in Inazuma ended). Ganyu and Xiao are at minimum 3700 because that's when Liyue Harbor was founded.

Neuvillette reincarnated but partially remembers his previous life, so depends on how you count his age as well.
    So far they seem to be.

ZhongLi and Raiden Ei are confirmed to be older than the beginning of the Archon War.

But GanYu is stupid old. We only know ZhongLi (of the playable characters) to be older. And Raiden Ei is likely older than her, but is not really confirmed anywhere.

Venti could also be older than GanYu since he is part of the Thousand Winds of Time, but is unclear as the first mentions of him are pretty late in the Archon War.

After that we know Cloud Retainer is older than GanYu since she took care of her when she was a child, and most likely Moon Carver, and Mountain Shaper (?) Are older since they seem to be contemporaries to Cloud Retainer.

Marchosius/GuoBa might be older than GanYu, but is not exactly clear when he was born (or appeared), or even when he degraded into GuoBa.

So yeah, GanYu is among the top 5 oldest playable characters characters, and top 10 oldest living known characters.
        What's with the weird capitalizations?
            Probably trying to imitate the Chinese pinyin for their names, but for some reason they decided to remove the space between the words, creating this monstrosity.
            Basically what PhasmicPlays said. I thought it was overall easier to read that way and easier to identify a LiYue (chinese) from an Inazuma (japanese) name.
                It doesn't necessarily make it easier to read for English speakers unfortunately. Instead, it puts an unfortunate emphasis on parts of the name where there necessarily wasn't any before. For example, Ganyu turning into GanYu makes reading it as if the Yu part is shouted out loud which I'm sure isn't your intent.
                    Also we play the game and probably know the country characters are associated with
with how old ganyu is i wonder how older is her mom, if she's still alive at all
I just want one scene where Ganyu mentions doing something absolutely badass during the Archon War in passing and then tries to downplay it as something anyone could do.
Still shy after 3000 years
Also a reminder that young Ganyu was such a chonker that she suffocated a monster to death when it tried to swallow her.
Ganyu was just made as the premium 1st limited waifu character imo. They did not put much in her character especially with her atrocious story.

Her whole story of being lonely as an adepti in the human world was so bad imo. She just assumed she was getting replaced because plot; she didn't even just asked Ningguangs secretaries their intentions on "replacing" her. Remember the berry fatui? She pretty much said The fatui won't retaliate if we beat them up cuz they have low reputation teehee...Girl. thats not how this works. If Paimon was the reasonable one saying we should just talk with the Fatui first then your 3000 years of experience becomes a joke.

The worse part of the story was the conflict of being an adepti in the human world. If we even ignore Yanfei in the picture, WHY WAS MADAME PING NEVER MENTIONED? She's much older than Ganyu and was also a resident of Liyue Harbor for longer than 3000 years. She 100% has insight on accepting herself being an adepti in the human world but Ganyu had 0 mentions about her? What?
I mean, she's essentially the patron demi-goddess of Liyue, guiding its rulers and protecting its people for the entirety of its existence on behalf of the Archon she contracted with.  Her work basically *is* her life, and her religion.  

I'm just confused why she's so often portrayed as a frazzled office worker rather than a superhuman Adeptus of legendary skill, who has cultivated her abilities fighting in the Archon War, to the point where she rarely, if ever, needs sleep.
Well Liyue basically stayed the same without any technological advancements in 3000+ years. It's almost like they're in a perpetual dream
Someone tell Yaoyao
I thought this was going in a different direction with that title.
Nah to the devs she is a "uwu big boob hardworking Asian waifu" downvote me all you want but that's all she is to them, showcased perfectly by her birthday pose and her boobs being in the centre
    Her boobs aren't the center of that picture imo. But, why expect downvotes? From what I've seen, what you said is a pretty commonly agreed upon viewpoint that people have on how the devs present Ganyu
        It's the main sub, my experience is that you can't say anything negative about the waifus.
    Her boobs not even that big.
Yeah she could easily tell us what happened 500 years ago.
Even if I also feel like we don't know much about her, I would rather have the writer move on with her character rather than using screentime to fix her. I'll not like her regardless, personally I think they should use her to make Cloud Retainer shine.
3000 they have more to talk about indeed
Been playing Star Rail, and I've really enjoyed the depiction of people in the Xianzhou Luofu, basically a whole city of near immortals. There are some people who use their years to be wise and talented, yes, but some who are hundreds of years old and haven't mentally matured past being a teenager. And honestly I believe that there are many people who if given immortality would simply settle into cyclical habits and not bother to develop past that. After all, why rush to change when you have all the time in the world?
    The Xianzhou people are simply humans with prolonged youth, It's mentioned they have less neuroplasticity which means they mentally develop slower than a short lived human. In Ganyu's case however she is half-godlike being half-human, she isn't akin to a Xianzhou native in terms of her nature as a long lived being, as far we know
And she also killed a God with her ass thickness 🍑
But to Ganyu, her work is her life. Not working for extended periods of time might make her depressed.
Imagine talking to a woman double your age like this,’hey,mind talking about your life with me?’What comes next?
    Well, It's not often you get to speak to someone 3000 years old, any normal person knowing their age would ask them "how have things been for you?" Especially considering Ganyu barely talks about herself
        Because people in general don’t talk about their true feelings to much younger people who don’t share same life experiences.Like you may share some joy with your nephew but not real emotions that haunt you as you know they can’t understand.
Hot hag
Ok, bear with me for a second - people talk about wanting to live forever, but in practice hoo boy. If Ganyu lived in our world, she would've been born a millennium BEFORE Jesus Christ. She would've watched humanity go from rice being cultivated in ancient Japan and China, David being crowned King of Israel; to current day events. The Iron Age, the crusades, the building of the pyramids, all the way to the introduction of the internet and you reading this.

Think about all of the people you'd meet in that span of time, just to watch them wither and die. Missing lovers and partners and friends and maybe even children - all of them long dead and lost to the ravages of time. I think I'd go mad. 

With that in mind, knowing all she's seen in Teyvat - according to the wiki, the Archon war was ~2600 years ago, meaning Ganyu would've been young, but present for it. She also would've been 1000 years old to see the rise and fall of Khaenri'ah. That's a heavy burden of memories to carry around.

More importantly, she might throw herself into her work in the belief that it helps keep the world stable and prosperous. And those memories might be too painful and personal to share.
3000 in lore only. The way she's written and designed is like some insecure teenager. Genshin writers don't seem to know how to write ancient folk.
I believe Xiao is the oldest playable non-archon, if not the Traveler themselves
Isn’t she the oldest playable character outside of Venti, Zhongli, and Xiao? Ei, Yae Miko, Furina, and Neuv are only around half a century old and everyone else is younger than that, no?
That's why she's one of the most boring/uninteresting characters. Anything relevant about her is her being in Archon war 2600 years ago. That's it. She's been just a gov officer who works like 20 hrs daily.
Copium theory: when we eventually travel back in time, we will finally be able to see her fight in all her glory and this is why the writers didn't give too much for her to do, they're setting her up.

Real talk now, Girl wants to be a human! The fact is, she's been the only constant in Liyue's government for Millennia. If you think about it, Zhong Li is the Geo archon but Ganyu is the administrator of Liyue. She's been the Qixing's secretary ever since the city was built, her devotion to her nation and it's people is nothing short of admirable, she's THE GOAT.

But...her presentation in quests is really lackluster, what I said above is the lore, but it's not what we get to experience, which is a shame.
I don't care if she's old enough to be my great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great grandma. Different strokes for different folks.
But that's her character, though. She has turned her work into her life over 3000 years. It's how she tried to integrate with human society after the Archon Wars.

However many hundreds of years of secretary experience for generations of successive Liyue Qixing.
But almost any other is mentally more mature than her
    I'd certainly say Ganyu is a pretty mature person, she's highly diligent. It's just that she's not super in tune with herself or her emotions, but that's where her lack of maturity ends
        I think any mature person can deal with themselves after 3000 years
What else would she focus on around mortals, though? One thing people often don't think about when it comes to the idea of long-life species is that at best they see regular humans similar to how we see dogs - yeah, you can love them, but you know they're going to die within your lifespan, and that's the dynamic when the longer living species has a lifespan of  around 6 times of the shorter one. 3000 years is around 150 human generations, or 30-40 human lifespans (depending how you count the average lifespan of someone in a world with Teyvat's technology level), and that's just how long she lived so far, not her entire lifespan. Any specific friend she would try to make among humans would die quickly, at least from her perspective. The only semblence of stability and continuity she can get from human society is if she focuses on fulfiling a specific role that will always be needed - like working.

A look into Ganyu's perspective might, realistically, end up with the Traveler realizing not that Ganyu is overburdened, but that her work is an escape, something she prefers to focus on to not think that anyone she can go out and meet right now will be dead in what to her feels like a very short amount of time.
    >What else would she focus on around mortals, though?

I'm talking about how Ganyu mostly talks about her work with the Traveler, not that she should focus on something else, her work is very important. The Traveler is Ganyu's trusted friend, because of that I don't see why she wouldn't speak to the Traveler about her long life, even if the Traveler wasn't actually incredibly old too.
Given she signed a contract to serve liyue work kind of is her life. Also I bet it would feel kind of pointless making friends as doing constant bureaucratic work for thousands of years probably makes each day seem like a blink of an eye and it might seem to her like she just got to know someone when they suddenly pass from old age.
I feel like they should have expounded on Ganyu's long life and her feelings of loneliness and not belonging.

The perfect way to do this would have been to make it so that while Ganyu has the lifespan of an adeptus, her being half human makes it so her mind is more like a human's than the adepti. 

Then make it so it is hard for her to remember anything beyond the past 70+ years of her current life (which is about the average human lifespan). She can only remember select memories from beyond that point like the archon war which had such a big impact that she is still able to remember that 3000 years later. 

Then her feelings of loneliness can come from the fact that she can only have vague recollections of the people she's met more than a hundred years ago and she doesn't have control over what she does and doesn't remember. This leads to unattachment issues and perhaps she would feel a bit guilty for only having vague recollections of normal humans she used to be close with and considered her friends.
her life is all about getting cooked by her master LMAO
i understand what you mean
Fun fact, Zhongli refers to her as being one of the younger adepti.
Don't care still smash.o
But still she's hot.
I love my grandma wife

    The fat shaming never fails to be funny
        It's very Asian
            It is very "world culture"
        I'm not sure if that's fat-shaming and more just, like, objectively stating with affection that she was a large child and Paimon laughing at Ganyu's embarrassment.

Fat-shaming would be more like "One remembers when you were a fat kid, thank Stone-God that you lost all that weight".

I get the odd feeling that she'll soon be telling us a lot more
    i guess we can only dream
        We'll know for sure when the drip marketing for 4.4 drops.
    Her voice lines in the menu be all about that dumpling ganyu
Plump she was back then

Cloud Retainer will be the best girl, Mark my words
    Hell yeah
Hopefully Ganyu will not interrupt Cloudie again
Yes! I wish there was some additional story emphasizing how Ganyu fought during the Archon War and has been actively helping Liyue Harbor since it’s founding. But, it’s usually always story about the other adepti or Yaksha.

Two fanfics I would like to recommend that play with some cool ideas about Ganyu:
>[Tianming](https://archiveofourown.org/works/28531878) plays with the idea that Ganyu was the assassin/defender of the Harbor and silenced any enemies/detractors of Rex Lapis within the city.

>[Everfrost](https://archiveofourown.org/works/38732049) is a Liyue Archon Quest AU where Ganyu goes on a rampage hunting down those responsible for Rex Lapis’s ‘death’ and any threats to the Harbor (Spoiler: Childe becomes hamburger, Signora becomes a popsicle)
    Bro I just read everfrost and holy shit, it was cool (intended)
I believe that was actually Ganyu's mom, not Ganyu herself. Ganyu entered the fold later
    Zhongli about Ganyu:

>Liyue's prosperity has not been merely built on Rex Lapis' oracles or wisdom. It is also thanks to the countless servants of the Geo Archon who have honored their end of the contract. Of them, ***Ganyu is the one who has served for the longest time*****.** If you want to know about her past... You should ask her about it. I fear my wording would not be delicate enough to receive her approval.

From Ganyu's vision story:

>Qilin are paragons of benevolence among the adepti, drinking only freshwater and eating only plants. Flies they will not hurt, and a bruised reed they will not break. They do not travel abroad, do not gather in herds, and no trap will hold them. They are leisurely yet composed, active but reserved — a gentle and elegant race. Yet when a wicked beast from the sea arose and threatened the land beneath their feet, that peaceful life ceased to be an option. ***Three thousand years ago, Ganyu answered the call of Morax the God of Geo, aiding him in the Archon Wars.***

She also met Guizhong a couple of times, it is very unlikely to be about her mom given that we know pretty much nothing about her and Cloud Retainer talks about Ganyu like she's been in her care since she was a baby.
        I don’t know too much about the lore but serving the longest doesn’t mean the first. For example if the first quit after 2500 years.
            Editors note: quit means died in action.
                Adepti Never Die, they only go missing in action
                    Adeptus-117
                    *Looks at the Yaksha
                    Adeptal Caine??!!???!!
                KIA
            I like how we're making shit up though.

Like where did OP even get the idea that Ganyu's mom served in the war as one of the first?

What happened to the 5 great adepti with Xiao? Though Xiao had to be rescued during the war so he couldn't really be one of the first ones. And when did Cloud Retainer, Mountain Shaper, Aloof 4-legs, and Ping join?

Where did Ganyu's mom come into any of this?
        Has Ganyu met Guizhong? What did they talk about? Which lore talks about it??
            I don’t recall them talking about anything, Ganyu mentioned meeting Guizhong during this year’s lantern rite
    I think it's unlikely to be Ganyu's mom. 

We know essentially nothing about her, the only thing we have is a story of a Qilin eating some dude's clothes and having sexy time with him as an apology, then she abandoned the baby to him?

We don't have a name, nor what she did beyond giving birth to Ganyu. Hell, if we don't take that story as being about specifically Ganyu's parents then we don't even know if the mom was the Qilin or not.

So, showing a character we know so little of during the fall of the Guili Assembly and not even mentioning her seems weird to me. But if it was Ganyu not mentioning anything would make sense, it would be unnecessary.
        I didn't realize we even knew that much.
        I hadn't heard about the story about the Qilin leaving a child with someone, but I believe the Qilin in that one animated cutscene was Ganyu's mom since I don't think Ganyu is able to take a Qilin form floating around like that, that cutscene has humans and all the adepti in that cutscene were in their animal forms. So with the art direction of that cutscene, I feel like if that was Ganyu in it she would've been depicted as more human.

Besides, Genshin isn't foreign to the idea of introducing something or someone then just not mentioning anything until years later
            >I don't think Ganyu is able to take a Qilin form floating around like that

why not?
                Half adepti are closer to human than full adepti. For example, iirc Yanfei stated she couldn't do sub-space creation, and half adepti need a vision to control the element. In this regard, half adepti are just like regular humans. So it makes sense to assume that they don't possess full beast form either
                    Half adepti have powers that don't include a vision though. That includes Yanfei and Ganyu. For game purposes they have visions and elements that we use explicitly though.

The lore calls out how they do not need visions period to tap into their powers. And yanfei is a very new adepti, so new that her human parent is still alive.
                        Yes and no. 

They do have Adepti aura and stuffs but they don't have insane ability like shape shifting. If they do, then Ganyu wouldn't have had to control her eating habits just to control the size of her waistline lol.

The natural abilities of Half Adepti are just not to the extent of the full Adepti. 

In Ganyu's vision story, getting her vision was said to be a significant power boost for her. They're not just decorations to fit in the human society like Xiao's Vision. Age doesn't play a big role either. I mean Xiao's younger than Ganyu and yet his abilities are far stronger than Ganyu's
            I agree that half adepti, like Ganyu and Yanfei, does not possess any beast form, but that doesn't mean that Qilin was Ganyu's mom. It is possible, though, but talking about headcannon like it's a fact will just set you up for disappointment
    She was the one that choked someone to death though so she's definitely there.
        But not that monster

May they rest in paimon
        I think a monster tried swallowing her and her hips were so wide it choked to death
            Stop this nonsense, my ganyu was a fat plump baby, the monster choke on her waist not hips. She's so fat and round that she can roll down the mountain like a ball! - cloud retainer
    where do people keep pulling ganyu's mom from? as far as we know, her only mother figure is cloud retainer
        People have parents, she's half-human half-adepti, so Ganyu has parents, she didn't come from nowhere after all. But Cloud Retainer is her current parent
    Read Zhongli’s voiceline about her. Literally says Ganyu’s the one that’s worked with him the longest. So yes she’s the first.
        The longest does not equal the first.

Doesn't Azdaha predate Ganyu's 3000 years for example? Won't be the longest simply because, ahemm, they split ways.
            I think he's older than Zhongli, Morax just unearthed him
        There could be others who simply aren’t with him anymore. Maybe they died or went their separate ways, but Ganyu hasn’t, yet. Hence her being the longest, but not the first.
    We don’t have enough information about Qilin.Don’t forget Zhongli also has Qilin parent(s).
        Hnm, what? One of Zhongli's forms is a mix between a dragon and a qilin, but 1) we don't know if that's his true form, we only know that he can "shed" that skin like snakes do, 2) we don't even know if he was born like a normal being, he could have just been born out of the existence from all we know.

The current lore we know is that *some* gods *might* have been born out of Phanes fragments after the war with the Second Who Came. But since Venti was a Wind Spirit, Zhongli could still be from a completely different origin.
            I wonder what is the origin of makoto and ei,were they also youkai?
And she's among the few to not know Zhongli is Rex Lapis. Which I find hilarious.
    Remember last year's Lantern Rite? She already knew
        Really? I don't remember
Ganuy is one of these characters with the most interesting backstories that you know will never be explored because the Devs gave her a mind-blowing.... three character traits. And only one is slightly related to her backstory. She likes food but feels guilty for eating, she is a workaholic and she feels like she doesn't fit in.
    Honestly, i kinda like that, A character that lived for 3000 years, joined a war with gods and probably more wars after that is now living a relatively peaceful life being a workaholic, worrying about the little things in life. Shes took the complete opposite route of xiao, dude still fights demons without rest after so long, after losing so many loved once, even though its his nature im pretty sure he can live life a lil which what ganyu is doing imo. Writen at 3am and my heads hurting, hope that mad sense, prob not lol
        The 3 am essay, a classic. 



Yeah makes sense mate, ig there's appeal to be found in her simplicity
            Its legit 3am 😭 welcome to east asia and the time where i doom scroll on reddit cuz haha yes
                I get it man, I really do, happy scrolling until you pass out mate
                    Prob gonna hapen in a few mins lmao
        That honestly is a good way to put it, it makes me like ganyu a bit more as a character, however I do think we can learn more about her life and personality a bit more.
    The number of character traits isn't the problem here. Any playable character could probably be summarized like that. The problem is that they don't and most probably won't do anything interesting with her. She's supposed to be a cute, overworked girl and that's it. She won't have any character arc where her past becomes relevant and she undergoes some development, which is the case for almost every character in Genshin.
    She's also vegetarian but invites Traveler to fish with her in birthday mail.

            I'm not sure Ganyu would be into hurting fish for fun.
                I assume she heals the fish? Or maybe special adeptus fishing rods XD
        there do be mekafish in Fontaine
    Given enough time, these three traits could be amazingly expanded upon
I don't know if it's Unfortunate cause it's clearly intentional

Ganyu is someone who works a lot and seems to enjoy working for the most part. I also think it might be intentional for her.

If she's always working she's not on personal time and not forming relationships in that personal time, relationships that will only cause her pain as she outlives nearly every person she's ever met.

The more she works the less personal time for relationships she has, the less personal relationships she has the less she'll be hurt when that person grows old and dies.

It's also clear from her story Cutscene that Ganyu does not like having free time because when she does her mind inevitable drifts back to the fact "You don't belong in this society, you are an other and everyone here you care about will die while you keep on living without them"

I don't think Ganyu being a worker bee is unfortunate, I think it's either used to inform or based on some of her characters core wants, needs and fears
shout to genshin devs for being allergic to consistently good writing
That’s more on Xiao than anything. The traveler is literally the only person he reluctantly associates with.
    In one of his birthday messages he went to visit another Adepti to just talk and they started panicking because they thought someone horrible had happened, otherwise Xiao wouldn't have come.

&#x200B;

So yeah, Xiao is just really anti-social, to the point that him showing up is reason to panic.
        I wonder if Xiao could have avoided being afflicted with the karmic residues of dead gods... if he had simply shot enemies from 1km away like Ganyu's cryo sniper bow
            Maybe? Either that or everything gives off the same amount of Karmic debt, and Ganyu was just doing big game hunting while he was wiping out armies.
                This is a Dottore-tier experiement

"Does physical distance affect accumulation of bad karmic from killing dead gods?"

*Forces Collei to shank Orobashi's corpse*
                    Well it's got to be quantity or distance. Or Xiao did alot of kill stealing.
        The real lore is in the birthday messages
    What if Ganyu attempted to get close to Xiao in the past and just gave up after the 50th attempt
        Iirc her voiceline about him implies she doesnt want to.

" I can understand that, to be honest, but I'm not really about to try and get close to him. I mean... all the people he's ever agreed to team up with are no longer with us..."
            oof my mans a walking death flag
                Bennett but worse 😭
            IIRC this is also a weird EN translation. In the JP and CN versions she rather means to say: "I'd like to but he's been through so much, I don't know how to approach him".
            Traveler foreshadowing 💀
            His main team was that adepti team that went to the abyss and lost their minds and he would have died too if Venti didn't swoop in and manhandle Xiao's sweet ass, because what was Zhongli doing??

Thankfully Zhongli learned his lesson about Xiao's sweet ass and saved that ass in present time when Xiao was about to make the SAME MISTAKE TWICE...oh wait Zhongli was really there to save Yelan lmao.
                Dunno if you're memeing but Xiao's team didnt go in the abyss it was only one of them (and it wasnt even the abyss but the chasm) and Venti didnt "swoop in to save Xiao" he just carried the song of his flute with the wind
        That's what happened in her story quest though in a training form. I wish we could see them interacting more. 

I think this was more on Xiao than Ganyu.
    Isn't that because of Xiao's curse or something? He can't be around people unless they have crazy energy like Traveller or Zhongli.
    Hu Tao too, now
        Don't forget your favorite drunk bard too
It kind of makes sense since Xiao's work involves many backdoor stuff that Rex Lapis wouldn't want the common people or anyone else to know. Also Xiao purposely isolates himself from others so that he won't endanger them.
    Phrasing!
Xiao is the black ops of zhongli, he may be kinda distant from the rest of the adepti
Xiao doesn’t talk to *anybody.* Also he’s active across Liyue, rarely going near Liyue Harbour, and Ganyu is always in Liyue Harbour.
Yea, that's the odd part. Sometimes I think the writers may have accidentally wrote themselves into a corner with making someone like Ganyu be one of the older playable characters, considering how outstandingly wise and seasoned all the other hundreds of year old characters are. Meanwhile outside of her work, Ganyu seems pretty unseasoned
    She's been living with internal anxiety of not fitting into either side of society.

On adepti side she's only a half so she feels inferior, while on human side she live too long to really feel like she's part of them when she's seen multiple generations of a family come and gone.

Didn't help that until the end of AQ adepti and humans were basically segregated.

She isn't some wise being with 3000 years of studying the world, she's a (archon) war veteran with depression and sense of isolation shoving herself into work because it's the one thing she doesn't feel sadge about (there's also food, but the resulting weight gain will make her sadge)
        Even considering that, the strange thing is that she gives the impression that she's still young. I don't think her feelings of not being able to fit in would stunt her to this degree, with that age she would still have an understanding of the world better than most 

That's why by default most of Genshin's characters that are hundreds of years old are written to be seasoned and rich in experience overall, except for one but that was a special case
            to be fair, most of our interactions with Ganyu includes Cloud Retainer/ other adepti (who are considered older)

in comparison, her interactions with other humans feels normal and doesn’t really young-ify Ganyu
                Actually Ganyu's friendship with that one Qixing fishing guy seriously makes Ganyu seem rather young, I would say this about a good portion of her interactions with humans. Then there's comparing Ganyu to many other human playable characters who, in comparison to Ganyu outside her work, seem equally or more experienced than her with life.
    It’s hard to write a proper long-living character.Night elf in WOW surely lives very longer than general races, but they are not obviously stronger or smarter.
        frieren exist
They mention this in genshin where long-life characters fall suspect to "erosion". It's why Raiden made the Raiden Shogun.
Yeah, god-like minds are different from human minds. It's why immortality was the punishment dished out upon Khaenrian nobility by Celestia, Celestia knows it's creations well enough to understand that it's torture for most humans
The last human we saw live for 500 years suffered a ton of mental trauma, and she definitely needs a hug afterwards.
    She gets all the hugs everyday. She’s permanently on my overworld team, with Kirara as her emotional support kitty.
    A hug and all the love and affection in the world
>going insane from boredom or grief at continuously watching your loved ones die.

An argument that wouldn't hold in modern times. There's so much information that you have an endless stream of things to do to avoid boredom. So much to learn and so much entertainment to consume. The loved ones part depends on each person. If you just don't have any loved ones, outliving people means little.
    > If you just don't have any loved ones, outliving people means little.

Humans are, primarily, social beings, in the sense that we need actual interactions with other humans to remain sane. Very noticeable during the pandemic, when most of our interactions were online, but extremely important and valuable overall. A human with no built relationships with another, be it physically or digitally, will fall ill with loneliness or depression, as much as they can be antisocial. I can see some relying on building relationships with fictional beings (books, games, artists or other famous persons, OCs, etc) but I personally don't see this lasting or remaining a healthy practice in the long run.
        I mean, you can just keep people at the acquaintance level, no need to get attached to them. That way, no matter how many die, it won't deeply affect you.
            But there is a thing  
Humans need attachement
                Pets are always a possibility.
                    This sounds sad
she’s sleepy
Well there's uuuhh...that one time she choked a monster with her ass and...hhmmmmmm
Genshin writing everyone
Literally me
Well the insanity Jing Liu experiences is just the mara sickness she's fading in and out of, mortal minds and bodies aren't exactly built to manage something like mara sickness
    Mara struck is not unique to humans though, Foxians who aren't immortal can also fall to it but they usually die off before getting old enough to experience it. And Ganyu is half human so she shouldn't be as well equipped as actual adepti. I always kinda assumed she was less than 1000 years old like a lot of the other long lived characters in the game, since the characters who lived longer than that has a much more ancient vibe to them (newer Archons vs older Archons).
    Affaik mara is caused by building up of excess memories and negative emotions so the longer someone live the more likely they get struck with it. I imagine if Ganyu was in HSR even if she is a half-adepti she would still suffer from some mental problems at least since she's also half-human.

But then again being that dedicated to working is already a sign of serious mental issue* 


*this message was brought to you by Qingque, your local gambling diviner
        > Affaik mara is caused by building up of excess memories and negative emotions

I still don't completely buy that. It doesn't explain why they undergo sudden rapid physical mutations. Dan Shu noted that people with incurable congenital conditions who become mara struck are inexplicably healed. We also see the downside in Bailu's quest, when a woman who is losing herself to it puts on a set of armor to disguise herself and her flesh *grows over it* in a matter of mere minutes, fusing it to her body.

Saying "they went crazy because they had too many memories" is all well and good, but fails to fully address the issue, and thus I don't really trust that explanation.
> even in Honkai Star Rail the oldest playable character is at most 1.5k years old (Jing Liu)

Screwllum is meant to be older than Nanook
Well, Cloud Retainer isn't going to stay a background NPC for long.

Mountain Shaper and Moon Carver though...

        Where was it cited? I'm curious
            Character Story: Codex Finalum

Or something like that
Genshin's writing choices are really hard to understand sometimes
Maybe because everyone either stops mentally maturing or starts to erode. Raiden locked herself up to maintain her mental, so she acts like a child sometimes. Or Zhongli acts like he’s ancient, because he is, and he’s actively resisting erosion.
I'd argue that in Genshin that all older characters are rich in experience to a degree that it fits their age, It's just Ganyu that's the odd one out. There's another who's an odd one out, but there's an explanation for that
    Ganyu only happens to be the "old character" with the least screen time

but xiao isnt really different from her in the aspect of not looking "wise" as an old character
        Xiao is not wise, but he has demonstrated himself to be an incredibly experienced person who's shut himself off from most others due to his profession.
Fr, Yanfei’s dad coming back to Liyue would be a great way to get her involved in literally anything. The last major appearance she had was the cooking competition iirc and before that it was the Sereniteapot
    I think you may have forgotten the Archon Quest Interlude in the Chasm?
        Tbh, I always rope that in with the event but how could I forget about running around the caves with her?
there is a movie called men of the eath ( or something like this) where the guy is an immortal ancient human who lived for thousand of years. The thing is that he can only experience what he lives, he only see what he see, he work to eat, he walk, he sleep, he makes friends and his friends die, he had no superpower to know more that what is around him and forget things like we forget , so he lives a normal life. Basically every adepti .
Honestly that'd actually be a good explanation as to why she never talks a lot about her past even to people she trusts, she just barely knows it. There's potential for it add a good amount to her character, to really recontextualize her
In the archon quest where she forgets to tell us how to get to the jade chamber, definitely reminded me of that 😂
    She’s starting to get that divine Alzheimer.
It’s tragic that Kokomi and Ganyu are both my mains and my two favorite characters… and they both got the same “overworked girlie with little personality” treatment. I’m still hoping future events might flesh them out a bit more
    Same. Ganyu and Kokomi mains waiting for more content
This is a Chinese secretary- the most important person in the communist party is the general secretary
    Ya, you can muicanize it too. We have a Secretary of State which is a high ranking official, too, which is fourth in secession for leadership. It's easy for the title "Secretary" to be seen as the common usage for a low level every like position but there are plenty of high ranking "Secretarys" as well.
    Yeah, secretary = Minister/Director.

The US uses this title ex Secretary of State = Minister of Foreign Affairs.

Ganyu is pretty high up there without being a "Public" figure.
        Is Ganyu higher or lower than Uncle Tian/Ningguang/Keqing ?
> it has no cutscene.  

Isn’t this the cutscene? https://youtu.be/YsQ9qrl97CM?si=yK2ZRoMEZwOPyqKJ
    Eh, technically it is. But the fact that it failed to leave me an impression that her quest DOES have one makes it bad.

Maybe it sounds a bit personal, but I want cutscene to engage the story's climax point (fighting scene like Wrio or Alhaitham, touching emotion like Yoimiya or Ayaka, or a "the character finally realizes or perceives sth" vibe like Neuvi). Ganyu's cutscene is more like an illustration of her ongoing problem which has persisted for thousands of years. Even without it, I can clearly remember what her problem is. What I don't really recall is how we were able to resolve it, at least temporarily.
Zhongli is ~6000, Venti is 3000+. We don't know how old Raiden is, other than also being at least around 3000 (we also don't know when the Archon War in Inazuma ended). Ganyu and Xiao are at minimum 3700 because that's when Liyue Harbor was founded.

Neuvillette reincarnated but partially remembers his previous life, so depends on how you count his age as well.
So far they seem to be.

ZhongLi and Raiden Ei are confirmed to be older than the beginning of the Archon War.

But GanYu is stupid old. We only know ZhongLi (of the playable characters) to be older. And Raiden Ei is likely older than her, but is not really confirmed anywhere.

Venti could also be older than GanYu since he is part of the Thousand Winds of Time, but is unclear as the first mentions of him are pretty late in the Archon War.

After that we know Cloud Retainer is older than GanYu since she took care of her when she was a child, and most likely Moon Carver, and Mountain Shaper (?) Are older since they seem to be contemporaries to Cloud Retainer.

Marchosius/GuoBa might be older than GanYu, but is not exactly clear when he was born (or appeared), or even when he degraded into GuoBa.

So yeah, GanYu is among the top 5 oldest playable characters characters, and top 10 oldest living known characters.
    What's with the weird capitalizations?
        Probably trying to imitate the Chinese pinyin for their names, but for some reason they decided to remove the space between the words, creating this monstrosity.
        Basically what PhasmicPlays said. I thought it was overall easier to read that way and easier to identify a LiYue (chinese) from an Inazuma (japanese) name.
            It doesn't necessarily make it easier to read for English speakers unfortunately. Instead, it puts an unfortunate emphasis on parts of the name where there necessarily wasn't any before. For example, Ganyu turning into GanYu makes reading it as if the Yu part is shouted out loud which I'm sure isn't your intent.
                Also we play the game and probably know the country characters are associated with
Her boobs aren't the center of that picture imo. But, why expect downvotes? From what I've seen, what you said is a pretty commonly agreed upon viewpoint that people have on how the devs present Ganyu
    It's the main sub, my experience is that you can't say anything negative about the waifus.
Her boobs not even that big.
The Xianzhou people are simply humans with prolonged youth, It's mentioned they have less neuroplasticity which means they mentally develop slower than a short lived human. In Ganyu's case however she is half-godlike being half-human, she isn't akin to a Xianzhou native in terms of her nature as a long lived being, as far we know
Well, It's not often you get to speak to someone 3000 years old, any normal person knowing their age would ask them "how have things been for you?" Especially considering Ganyu barely talks about herself
    Because people in general don’t talk about their true feelings to much younger people who don’t share same life experiences.Like you may share some joy with your nephew but not real emotions that haunt you as you know they can’t understand.
I'd certainly say Ganyu is a pretty mature person, she's highly diligent. It's just that she's not super in tune with herself or her emotions, but that's where her lack of maturity ends
    I think any mature person can deal with themselves after 3000 years
>What else would she focus on around mortals, though?

I'm talking about how Ganyu mostly talks about her work with the Traveler, not that she should focus on something else, her work is very important. The Traveler is Ganyu's trusted friend, because of that I don't see why she wouldn't speak to the Traveler about her long life, even if the Traveler wasn't actually incredibly old too.

    I'm not sure if that's fat-shaming and more just, like, objectively stating with affection that she was a large child and Paimon laughing at Ganyu's embarrassment.

Fat-shaming would be more like "One remembers when you were a fat kid, thank Stone-God that you lost all that weight".

Her voice lines in the menu be all about that dumpling ganyu
Hell yeah
Bro I just read everfrost and holy shit, it was cool (intended)
Zhongli about Ganyu:

>Liyue's prosperity has not been merely built on Rex Lapis' oracles or wisdom. It is also thanks to the countless servants of the Geo Archon who have honored their end of the contract. Of them, ***Ganyu is the one who has served for the longest time*****.** If you want to know about her past... You should ask her about it. I fear my wording would not be delicate enough to receive her approval.

From Ganyu's vision story:

>Qilin are paragons of benevolence among the adepti, drinking only freshwater and eating only plants. Flies they will not hurt, and a bruised reed they will not break. They do not travel abroad, do not gather in herds, and no trap will hold them. They are leisurely yet composed, active but reserved — a gentle and elegant race. Yet when a wicked beast from the sea arose and threatened the land beneath their feet, that peaceful life ceased to be an option. ***Three thousand years ago, Ganyu answered the call of Morax the God of Geo, aiding him in the Archon Wars.***

She also met Guizhong a couple of times, it is very unlikely to be about her mom given that we know pretty much nothing about her and Cloud Retainer talks about Ganyu like she's been in her care since she was a baby.
    I don’t know too much about the lore but serving the longest doesn’t mean the first. For example if the first quit after 2500 years.
        Editors note: quit means died in action.
            Adepti Never Die, they only go missing in action

                *Looks at the Yaksha
                Adeptal Caine??!!???!!
            KIA
        I like how we're making shit up though.

Like where did OP even get the idea that Ganyu's mom served in the war as one of the first?

What happened to the 5 great adepti with Xiao? Though Xiao had to be rescued during the war so he couldn't really be one of the first ones. And when did Cloud Retainer, Mountain Shaper, Aloof 4-legs, and Ping join?

Where did Ganyu's mom come into any of this?
    Has Ganyu met Guizhong? What did they talk about? Which lore talks about it??
        I don’t recall them talking about anything, Ganyu mentioned meeting Guizhong during this year’s lantern rite
I think it's unlikely to be Ganyu's mom. 

We know essentially nothing about her, the only thing we have is a story of a Qilin eating some dude's clothes and having sexy time with him as an apology, then she abandoned the baby to him?

We don't have a name, nor what she did beyond giving birth to Ganyu. Hell, if we don't take that story as being about specifically Ganyu's parents then we don't even know if the mom was the Qilin or not.

So, showing a character we know so little of during the fall of the Guili Assembly and not even mentioning her seems weird to me. But if it was Ganyu not mentioning anything would make sense, it would be unnecessary.
    I didn't realize we even knew that much.
    I hadn't heard about the story about the Qilin leaving a child with someone, but I believe the Qilin in that one animated cutscene was Ganyu's mom since I don't think Ganyu is able to take a Qilin form floating around like that, that cutscene has humans and all the adepti in that cutscene were in their animal forms. So with the art direction of that cutscene, I feel like if that was Ganyu in it she would've been depicted as more human.

Besides, Genshin isn't foreign to the idea of introducing something or someone then just not mentioning anything until years later
        >I don't think Ganyu is able to take a Qilin form floating around like that

why not?
            Half adepti are closer to human than full adepti. For example, iirc Yanfei stated she couldn't do sub-space creation, and half adepti need a vision to control the element. In this regard, half adepti are just like regular humans. So it makes sense to assume that they don't possess full beast form either
                Half adepti have powers that don't include a vision though. That includes Yanfei and Ganyu. For game purposes they have visions and elements that we use explicitly though.

The lore calls out how they do not need visions period to tap into their powers. And yanfei is a very new adepti, so new that her human parent is still alive.
                    Yes and no. 

They do have Adepti aura and stuffs but they don't have insane ability like shape shifting. If they do, then Ganyu wouldn't have had to control her eating habits just to control the size of her waistline lol.

The natural abilities of Half Adepti are just not to the extent of the full Adepti. 

In Ganyu's vision story, getting her vision was said to be a significant power boost for her. They're not just decorations to fit in the human society like Xiao's Vision. Age doesn't play a big role either. I mean Xiao's younger than Ganyu and yet his abilities are far stronger than Ganyu's
        I agree that half adepti, like Ganyu and Yanfei, does not possess any beast form, but that doesn't mean that Qilin was Ganyu's mom. It is possible, though, but talking about headcannon like it's a fact will just set you up for disappointment
She was the one that choked someone to death though so she's definitely there.
    But not that monster

May they rest in paimon
    I think a monster tried swallowing her and her hips were so wide it choked to death
        Stop this nonsense, my ganyu was a fat plump baby, the monster choke on her waist not hips. She's so fat and round that she can roll down the mountain like a ball! - cloud retainer
where do people keep pulling ganyu's mom from? as far as we know, her only mother figure is cloud retainer
    People have parents, she's half-human half-adepti, so Ganyu has parents, she didn't come from nowhere after all. But Cloud Retainer is her current parent
Read Zhongli’s voiceline about her. Literally says Ganyu’s the one that’s worked with him the longest. So yes she’s the first.
    The longest does not equal the first.

Doesn't Azdaha predate Ganyu's 3000 years for example? Won't be the longest simply because, ahemm, they split ways.
        I think he's older than Zhongli, Morax just unearthed him
    There could be others who simply aren’t with him anymore. Maybe they died or went their separate ways, but Ganyu hasn’t, yet. Hence her being the longest, but not the first.
We don’t have enough information about Qilin.Don’t forget Zhongli also has Qilin parent(s).
    Hnm, what? One of Zhongli's forms is a mix between a dragon and a qilin, but 1) we don't know if that's his true form, we only know that he can "shed" that skin like snakes do, 2) we don't even know if he was born like a normal being, he could have just been born out of the existence from all we know.

The current lore we know is that *some* gods *might* have been born out of Phanes fragments after the war with the Second Who Came. But since Venti was a Wind Spirit, Zhongli could still be from a completely different origin.
        I wonder what is the origin of makoto and ei,were they also youkai?
Remember last year's Lantern Rite? She already knew
    Really? I don't remember
Honestly, i kinda like that, A character that lived for 3000 years, joined a war with gods and probably more wars after that is now living a relatively peaceful life being a workaholic, worrying about the little things in life. Shes took the complete opposite route of xiao, dude still fights demons without rest after so long, after losing so many loved once, even though its his nature im pretty sure he can live life a lil which what ganyu is doing imo. Writen at 3am and my heads hurting, hope that mad sense, prob not lol
    The 3 am essay, a classic. 



Yeah makes sense mate, ig there's appeal to be found in her simplicity
        Its legit 3am 😭 welcome to east asia and the time where i doom scroll on reddit cuz haha yes
            I get it man, I really do, happy scrolling until you pass out mate
                Prob gonna hapen in a few mins lmao
    That honestly is a good way to put it, it makes me like ganyu a bit more as a character, however I do think we can learn more about her life and personality a bit more.
The number of character traits isn't the problem here. Any playable character could probably be summarized like that. The problem is that they don't and most probably won't do anything interesting with her. She's supposed to be a cute, overworked girl and that's it. She won't have any character arc where her past becomes relevant and she undergoes some development, which is the case for almost every character in Genshin.
She's also vegetarian but invites Traveler to fish with her in birthday mail.
    Catch n release ftw
        I'm not sure Ganyu would be into hurting fish for fun.
            I assume she heals the fish? Or maybe special adeptus fishing rods XD
    there do be mekafish in Fontaine
Given enough time, these three traits could be amazingly expanded upon
In one of his birthday messages he went to visit another Adepti to just talk and they started panicking because they thought someone horrible had happened, otherwise Xiao wouldn't have come.

&#x200B;

So yeah, Xiao is just really anti-social, to the point that him showing up is reason to panic.
    I wonder if Xiao could have avoided being afflicted with the karmic residues of dead gods... if he had simply shot enemies from 1km away like Ganyu's cryo sniper bow
        Maybe? Either that or everything gives off the same amount of Karmic debt, and Ganyu was just doing big game hunting while he was wiping out armies.

                Well it's got to be quantity or distance. Or Xiao did alot of kill stealing.
    The real lore is in the birthday messages
What if Ganyu attempted to get close to Xiao in the past and just gave up after the 50th attempt
    Iirc her voiceline about him implies she doesnt want to.

" I can understand that, to be honest, but I'm not really about to try and get close to him. I mean... all the people he's ever agreed to team up with are no longer with us..."
        oof my mans a walking death flag
            Bennett but worse 😭
        IIRC this is also a weird EN translation. In the JP and CN versions she rather means to say: "I'd like to but he's been through so much, I don't know how to approach him".
        Traveler foreshadowing 💀
        His main team was that adepti team that went to the abyss and lost their minds and he would have died too if Venti didn't swoop in and manhandle Xiao's sweet ass, because what was Zhongli doing??

Thankfully Zhongli learned his lesson about Xiao's sweet ass and saved that ass in present time when Xiao was about to make the SAME MISTAKE TWICE...oh wait Zhongli was really there to save Yelan lmao.
            Dunno if you're memeing but Xiao's team didnt go in the abyss it was only one of them (and it wasnt even the abyss but the chasm) and Venti didnt "swoop in to save Xiao" he just carried the song of his flute with the wind
    That's what happened in her story quest though in a training form. I wish we could see them interacting more. 

I think this was more on Xiao than Ganyu.
Isn't that because of Xiao's curse or something? He can't be around people unless they have crazy energy like Traveller or Zhongli.
Hu Tao too, now
    Don't forget your favorite drunk bard too
Phrasing!
She's been living with internal anxiety of not fitting into either side of society.

On adepti side she's only a half so she feels inferior, while on human side she live too long to really feel like she's part of them when she's seen multiple generations of a family come and gone.

Didn't help that until the end of AQ adepti and humans were basically segregated.

She isn't some wise being with 3000 years of studying the world, she's a (archon) war veteran with depression and sense of isolation shoving herself into work because it's the one thing she doesn't feel sadge about (there's also food, but the resulting weight gain will make her sadge)
    Even considering that, the strange thing is that she gives the impression that she's still young. I don't think her feelings of not being able to fit in would stunt her to this degree, with that age she would still have an understanding of the world better than most 

That's why by default most of Genshin's characters that are hundreds of years old are written to be seasoned and rich in experience overall, except for one but that was a special case
        to be fair, most of our interactions with Ganyu includes Cloud Retainer/ other adepti (who are considered older)

in comparison, her interactions with other humans feels normal and doesn’t really young-ify Ganyu
            Actually Ganyu's friendship with that one Qixing fishing guy seriously makes Ganyu seem rather young, I would say this about a good portion of her interactions with humans. Then there's comparing Ganyu to many other human playable characters who, in comparison to Ganyu outside her work, seem equally or more experienced than her with life.
It’s hard to write a proper long-living character.Night elf in WOW surely lives very longer than general races, but they are not obviously stronger or smarter.

She gets all the hugs everyday. She’s permanently on my overworld team, with Kirara as her emotional support kitty.
A hug and all the love and affection in the world
> If you just don't have any loved ones, outliving people means little.

Humans are, primarily, social beings, in the sense that we need actual interactions with other humans to remain sane. Very noticeable during the pandemic, when most of our interactions were online, but extremely important and valuable overall. A human with no built relationships with another, be it physically or digitally, will fall ill with loneliness or depression, as much as they can be antisocial. I can see some relying on building relationships with fictional beings (books, games, artists or other famous persons, OCs, etc) but I personally don't see this lasting or remaining a healthy practice in the long run.
    I mean, you can just keep people at the acquaintance level, no need to get attached to them. That way, no matter how many die, it won't deeply affect you.
        But there is a thing  
Humans need attachement
            Pets are always a possibility.
                This sounds sad
Mara struck is not unique to humans though, Foxians who aren't immortal can also fall to it but they usually die off before getting old enough to experience it. And Ganyu is half human so she shouldn't be as well equipped as actual adepti. I always kinda assumed she was less than 1000 years old like a lot of the other long lived characters in the game, since the characters who lived longer than that has a much more ancient vibe to them (newer Archons vs older Archons).
Affaik mara is caused by building up of excess memories and negative emotions so the longer someone live the more likely they get struck with it. I imagine if Ganyu was in HSR even if she is a half-adepti she would still suffer from some mental problems at least since she's also half-human.

But then again being that dedicated to working is already a sign of serious mental issue* 


*this message was brought to you by Qingque, your local gambling diviner
    > Affaik mara is caused by building up of excess memories and negative emotions

I still don't completely buy that. It doesn't explain why they undergo sudden rapid physical mutations. Dan Shu noted that people with incurable congenital conditions who become mara struck are inexplicably healed. We also see the downside in Bailu's quest, when a woman who is losing herself to it puts on a set of armor to disguise herself and her flesh *grows over it* in a matter of mere minutes, fusing it to her body.

Saying "they went crazy because they had too many memories" is all well and good, but fails to fully address the issue, and thus I don't really trust that explanation.

"In the far future, the law will have entered into the people's hearts. All people will be amiable, modest, and live happily in this world...

        Character Story: Codex Finalum

Or something like that
Ganyu only happens to be the "old character" with the least screen time

but xiao isnt really different from her in the aspect of not looking "wise" as an old character
    Xiao is not wise, but he has demonstrated himself to be an incredibly experienced person who's shut himself off from most others due to his profession.
I think you may have forgotten the Archon Quest Interlude in the Chasm?
    Tbh, I always rope that in with the event but how could I forget about running around the caves with her?
She’s starting to get that divine Alzheimer.
Same. Ganyu and Kokomi mains waiting for more content
Ya, you can muicanize it too. We have a Secretary of State which is a high ranking official, too, which is fourth in secession for leadership. It's easy for the title "Secretary" to be seen as the common usage for a low level every like position but there are plenty of high ranking "Secretarys" as well.
Yeah, secretary = Minister/Director.

The US uses this title ex Secretary of State = Minister of Foreign Affairs.

Ganyu is pretty high up there without being a "Public" figure.
    Is Ganyu higher or lower than Uncle Tian/Ningguang/Keqing ?
Eh, technically it is. But the fact that it failed to leave me an impression that her quest DOES have one makes it bad.

Maybe it sounds a bit personal, but I want cutscene to engage the story's climax point (fighting scene like Wrio or Alhaitham, touching emotion like Yoimiya or Ayaka, or a "the character finally realizes or perceives sth" vibe like Neuvi). Ganyu's cutscene is more like an illustration of her ongoing problem which has persisted for thousands of years. Even without it, I can clearly remember what her problem is. What I don't really recall is how we were able to resolve it, at least temporarily.
What's with the weird capitalizations?
    Probably trying to imitate the Chinese pinyin for their names, but for some reason they decided to remove the space between the words, creating this monstrosity.
    Basically what PhasmicPlays said. I thought it was overall easier to read that way and easier to identify a LiYue (chinese) from an Inazuma (japanese) name.
        It doesn't necessarily make it easier to read for English speakers unfortunately. Instead, it puts an unfortunate emphasis on parts of the name where there necessarily wasn't any before. For example, Ganyu turning into GanYu makes reading it as if the Yu part is shouted out loud which I'm sure isn't your intent.
            Also we play the game and probably know the country characters are associated with
It's the main sub, my experience is that you can't say anything negative about the waifus.
Because people in general don’t talk about their true feelings to much younger people who don’t share same life experiences.Like you may share some joy with your nephew but not real emotions that haunt you as you know they can’t understand.
I think any mature person can deal with themselves after 3000 years

I'm not sure if that's fat-shaming and more just, like, objectively stating with affection that she was a large child and Paimon laughing at Ganyu's embarrassment.

Fat-shaming would be more like "One remembers when you were a fat kid, thank Stone-God that you lost all that weight".

I don’t know too much about the lore but serving the longest doesn’t mean the first. For example if the first quit after 2500 years.

    I like how we're making shit up though.

Like where did OP even get the idea that Ganyu's mom served in the war as one of the first?

What happened to the 5 great adepti with Xiao? Though Xiao had to be rescued during the war so he couldn't really be one of the first ones. And when did Cloud Retainer, Mountain Shaper, Aloof 4-legs, and Ping join?

Where did Ganyu's mom come into any of this?
Has Ganyu met Guizhong? What did they talk about? Which lore talks about it??
    I don’t recall them talking about anything, Ganyu mentioned meeting Guizhong during this year’s lantern rite
I didn't realize we even knew that much.
I hadn't heard about the story about the Qilin leaving a child with someone, but I believe the Qilin in that one animated cutscene was Ganyu's mom since I don't think Ganyu is able to take a Qilin form floating around like that, that cutscene has humans and all the adepti in that cutscene were in their animal forms. So with the art direction of that cutscene, I feel like if that was Ganyu in it she would've been depicted as more human.

Besides, Genshin isn't foreign to the idea of introducing something or someone then just not mentioning anything until years later
    >I don't think Ganyu is able to take a Qilin form floating around like that

why not?
        Half adepti are closer to human than full adepti. For example, iirc Yanfei stated she couldn't do sub-space creation, and half adepti need a vision to control the element. In this regard, half adepti are just like regular humans. So it makes sense to assume that they don't possess full beast form either
            Half adepti have powers that don't include a vision though. That includes Yanfei and Ganyu. For game purposes they have visions and elements that we use explicitly though.

The lore calls out how they do not need visions period to tap into their powers. And yanfei is a very new adepti, so new that her human parent is still alive.
                Yes and no. 

They do have Adepti aura and stuffs but they don't have insane ability like shape shifting. If they do, then Ganyu wouldn't have had to control her eating habits just to control the size of her waistline lol.

The natural abilities of Half Adepti are just not to the extent of the full Adepti. 

In Ganyu's vision story, getting her vision was said to be a significant power boost for her. They're not just decorations to fit in the human society like Xiao's Vision. Age doesn't play a big role either. I mean Xiao's younger than Ganyu and yet his abilities are far stronger than Ganyu's
    I agree that half adepti, like Ganyu and Yanfei, does not possess any beast form, but that doesn't mean that Qilin was Ganyu's mom. It is possible, though, but talking about headcannon like it's a fact will just set you up for disappointment
But not that monster

May they rest in paimon
I think a monster tried swallowing her and her hips were so wide it choked to death
    Stop this nonsense, my ganyu was a fat plump baby, the monster choke on her waist not hips. She's so fat and round that she can roll down the mountain like a ball! - cloud retainer
People have parents, she's half-human half-adepti, so Ganyu has parents, she didn't come from nowhere after all. But Cloud Retainer is her current parent
The longest does not equal the first.

Doesn't Azdaha predate Ganyu's 3000 years for example? Won't be the longest simply because, ahemm, they split ways.
    I think he's older than Zhongli, Morax just unearthed him
There could be others who simply aren’t with him anymore. Maybe they died or went their separate ways, but Ganyu hasn’t, yet. Hence her being the longest, but not the first.
Hnm, what? One of Zhongli's forms is a mix between a dragon and a qilin, but 1) we don't know if that's his true form, we only know that he can "shed" that skin like snakes do, 2) we don't even know if he was born like a normal being, he could have just been born out of the existence from all we know.

The current lore we know is that *some* gods *might* have been born out of Phanes fragments after the war with the Second Who Came. But since Venti was a Wind Spirit, Zhongli could still be from a completely different origin.
    I wonder what is the origin of makoto and ei,were they also youkai?

That honestly is a good way to put it, it makes me like ganyu a bit more as a character, however I do think we can learn more about her life and personality a bit more.
Catch n release ftw
    I'm not sure Ganyu would be into hurting fish for fun.
        I assume she heals the fish? Or maybe special adeptus fishing rods XD
there do be mekafish in Fontaine
I wonder if Xiao could have avoided being afflicted with the karmic residues of dead gods... if he had simply shot enemies from 1km away like Ganyu's cryo sniper bow
    Maybe? Either that or everything gives off the same amount of Karmic debt, and Ganyu was just doing big game hunting while he was wiping out armies.

They do have Adepti aura and stuffs but they don't have insane ability like shape shifting. If they do, then Ganyu wouldn't have had to control her eating habits just to control the size of her waistline lol.

The natural abilities of Half Adepti are just not to the extent of the full Adepti. 

In Ganyu's vision story, getting her vision was said to be a significant power boost for her. They're not just decorations to fit in the human society like Xiao's Vision. Age doesn't play a big role either. I mean Xiao's younger than Ganyu and yet his abilities are far stronger than Ganyu's
Prob gonna hapen in a few mins lmao
Well it's got to be quantity or distance. Or Xiao did alot of kill stealing.
This sounds sad
