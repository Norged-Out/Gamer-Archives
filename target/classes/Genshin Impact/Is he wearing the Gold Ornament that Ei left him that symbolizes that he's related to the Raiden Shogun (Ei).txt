[[Is he wearing the Gold Ornament that Ei left him that symbolizes that he's related to the Raiden Shogun (Ei)]]





Well, it’s his “identity card” that he is under Shogun protection.
    Its just nice detail, knowing that he hates Raiden before, and now he's wearing it again.
        He is just carrying his old scars
            Hehe SCAR-a-mouche!!! HEHE
                Cyno stop making fun of kids with family issues smh.
                    I cyno problem with that
                        I don't cyno problem with that either.
                Get out please
                    Hmmm. I'm afraid I'll have to cyno.
                We just need a moustache  for a complete set
            Or maybe made peace with his past?
                I’d be more inclined to believe this than he just wants to carry old scars
                    It makes logical sense with the ideology of the Anemo Archon. Making peace with his past sets him free, because he is chained down by his past and is trying to force his way free.
            [removed]
                Perhaps it's because he was "reborn" in Sumero, or something like that.
                    Its cause he got his vision in Sumeru
                        Feels like a plain reason, but that is likely the case. Sorry, I was trying to give it a deeper meaning.
                            Same with Thoma. From monstadt, but got his vision in inazuma, so his vision is styled like inazuma.
                            There probably isn't any deeper meaning, remember that Visions are granted by Celestia and not the Archons. I don't think Celestia really cares to put any deeper thought into it than "you got a Vision in Sumeru so you get the Sumeru design."
                                Well, the ornamentation is actually done on part of the holders. Vision are literally just the little gem bit and can be removed. As shown in Inazuma.
            Scara has scar in his name. This boi just can’t get a W
            That or he is going to use this to claim backdated child support, all 500 years of it.
                Pity Ei doesn’t have any Mora.
            "I am my scars!"

- Scaramouche, maybe
                I can hear this comment oozing with Demon Hunter angst
            His old scaramouches
            you mean his old scaras?



maybe there's a good reason my parents don't love me after all.
            He's prideful is his current edgy phase so of course he'd keep a symbol of divide status, after that he'll probably just go tsundere about his mother problem.
        Hope the misunderstanding was cleared up
            Lukewarm take but I'd like for him to stay evil 🤷
                Well, judging by his expression, he'd still behave like the little shit that he is
                    I wish. I want a playable character who wants to actively kick traveller in the nuts
                        Well Childe kind of already wants to do that - in a best frenemies kind of way at any rate.
                            That's the thing, He is a softie. I want somebody who will shit talk the traveller because everyone just seems to adore them.
                                Voiceline: Hello

„So, here we are, Traveller. I hope you don’t think that you defeating me means that I‘ll lick your boots like all those other losers in your entourage. If you want me to join you, fine, I have nothing better to do right now. But if you mess up on the way I‘ll laugh in your stupid face, remember that.“

Voiceline: Ally at low HP
„Move aside, sucker.“

Voiceline: Heavy hit taken
„I‘ll fucking end you.“

Buuuut. I‘m not holding my breath. That nasty little smirk is not enough to convince me they won‘t turn Scara all uwu and emotional and soft for Traveller /sigh
                                    He just needs to be Xiao but not supportive. More angy.
                        Ask signora mains how that is going.

"I never asked for redemption."
                I’d like him to take after Signora.
                    By turning to ash?
                        Yes.
    Nagamasa: Oh no! Anyways.

>!*Proceeds to hurt Scara anyways and slew his friend.*!<
    "if lost, return to ei"
        Momma gotcho back-
        And then Ei wears a shirt with 'nah, give him to Yae'
            That’d be amazing take my upvote
    Maybe i'm projecting to much but as someone with a bad relation with his father, you can hate as much as you want your  parents as the end of the day the only thing you really want is to be loved by them... maybe this is why he keep it, he can't throw the hope.
    lol
I think he finally reconciled with his past XD
    Reconciled stars, the world runs in a loop
        I had a dream It was my birthday
            No
                In that dream, the Knight of flowers found me
                    "O wandering eccentric, we finally found you. Your sister can't wait to meet you."
    Well we don't know atleast to my knowledge if this is supposed to be before or after he joined the fatui. I assumed it was supposed to be a past version of him.
On his back there are lavender melons dangling that symbolizes his young friend that died.
    male anemo curse is real
        Sucrose also lost her friend.  So it just general anemo curse. 

Hope Faruzan won't be affected.
            So, what did Jean lose?

Sleep maybe? The girl is overworked
                Jean lost the 50/50. Now she has red qiqi.
                    God damn. Losing a 50/50 on a lost 50/50
                >what did Jean lose?

She's about to
                Her family broke apart.
                Honestly, probably her sense of freedom (which would be strangely poetic). She feels tied to her work as acting grand Master so much so that she doesn't really allow anyone to help her, overworking herself and confining herself to her office. Essentially removing her freedom in favor of giving the others, who are willing to help, full freedom.
                She's the one case that will lose her close one in the future
                Lisa
                Her parents divorced
                her dad i guess. Parents got divorced and they lived separately
                Family
                Technically her sister. Jean’s family divorced when she was young. Jean stayed with her mother while her father took Barbara. If I remember correctly there’s still a rift between the two.

Who knows, she might get the full Anemo curse later on though.
                her wife, Lisa is cursed with an early death. also sayus sensei vanished too
                Considering one of her closest friends, Lisa, is iirc implied to be dying, she'll fall into line with the anemo curse soon enough.
                    > Lisa, is iirc implied to be dying

Nah, she's probably less dying than everyone else, honestly.
                Family, but they are together now.
                Jean technically hasn’t lost anybody, yet. Lisa has a curse that shortens her life span in return for power. A lot of ppl think that at some point in the Sumeru arc Lisa is gonna die.
            If Faruzan is>! stuck in the past, technically she for sure had some friends or family that did not escape the grasp of time, right?!< So they are long gone now for sure. Does that count?
            Didn't sucrose's friends just grew apart ?
                one of them left on an adventure and "never returned"
                    Yeah but it's pretty vague  and by that point sucrose already grew apart from her friends
        Monkey pattern recognition goes brrrrr
He is her creation after all
    Its just nice detail, knowing that he hates Raiden before, and now he's wearing it again.
    Yes, he is mama’s boy
        [deleted]
            All the memes were actually true oml
This closeup just made me realize his vision is Sumeran, not Inazuman. Which I guess makes sense, if that’s where he receives it but still.
    We had already one quest involving somebody getting a vision, and it was in sumeru. But that wasn't animated in any way. I hope we get the epic cutscene of Scaramouche recieving one.
        Just imagine a cutscene like that.

Actually, imagine if it's right after we fight him (since he'll be the new weekly boss in 3.2), a whole defeat thing then just, a vision. And considering we've experienced someone obtaining a vision before we'll be able to recognize what it is.

That would just be cool.
    It's just like Thoma..
Now I wonder if Ei (or Shogun) will appear during 3.2 lol
    She probably won't, but in 3.3 for sure on his story quest.
        Really hoping for a Raiden/Scara double banner. That weapon banner would be tempting too.
            >!oh boy do i have news for you!<
                That double banner is going to WRECK absolutely everything on its path
                    If it actually happens. There has been no leaks that Raiden will appear for sure. It’s speculation that has good reasoning but don’t take it as gospel
                        They could choose violence. They could run him back to back or together with Hu Tao. XD
                            they probably will, adding ultimate physical queen to that (eula) or ayaka. anyway, if raiden family rerun will be back to back (yae, then ei and scara) and they will add hu tao and eula/ayaka in the next banner, weapon banners + most of the best elemental units will be in just 9 weeks. hyv want for us to spend our christmas money!
                No you don't. No one does yet.
                What news do you have that leakers don’t even know yet? Or do you mean that you mistook speculation as leaks?
                What news???
                Nuh, huh. We’ve all just been speculating. I’ve seen absolutely zero leaks about it being true. 

Cause seriously I’m wondering if I want Nahida cons or skip. I’m planning to use double crystals sometimes and idk if I wanna do it for her or skip cons and try to get both Raiden and Scara. 

But again, that weapon banner would be stacked. Honestly I think I’d wish on it even though I’d get a skyward pride or something super shitty from standard like I did the last two times I wished for weapons lol. At least it was jade spear and lost prayer which are pretty good IMO for standards. Just found out lost prayer is going on Nahida because I’ll have at least 950 em and I haven’t leveled my flower yet. Em goblet sucks ass though. Didn’t even level it yet because two trash subs and er% lol. Holding out hope for a better one…

But yeah engulfing lightning and Scara weapon. Tbh I don’t care for Scara’s design much, I expected it to be more eloquent with a crazy ornate design on his cape and one being in blue and the other white. Instead it’s just black shorts and those white Japanese robe shirts with the blue half cape thing over him. I liked his OG design better… so I’m hoping his kit is gonna be sick. Otherwise I may skip him too cause I also want Yelan. Maybe Al Haitham. Definitely Dehya, cons and maybe a wep for her. 

Mihoyo is making it so hard to choose bro. I went through the rerun gauntlet and only character I missed was Raiden to an early Ganyu that ruined my pity (wanted c6 Yanfei/Xingqui). This year is good release after good release and more reruns that have become more tempting with Dendro comps.
                    Tbh,I would say don't go for cons since we are not getting any endgame content like abyss.
                        I wanted Nahida to have faster Dendro app but I’m thinking it really won’t be worth it over a new character. Nahida is gonna be one of my mainstays but still…

Scara/Raiden sound like a super fun team though. That’s the main reason I wanna skip cons. And I kinda want Yelan and I’m going all in on Dehya like C2 and sig if they make her more fun or do something unique. Like I’ll drop money on her. Otherwise I’ll just throw Redhorn on her and call it a day if the weapon isn’t amazing either. 

And I always kinda wanted Yae as a pure waifu pull but I don’t think I’d ever play her… I’m a Keqing main already, pulled Cyno, and I’m going for Raiden so she seems unnecessary. Al Haitham exists also…

Mihoyo is really fucking us with these banners. Like damn they had 3.0 and dednro like it’s a big new thing to sell tighnari and cash in on Zhongli/Ganyu reruns. Now we’re going full in on crazy new characters and hype ass reruns back to back to back.
                            Fr, so many character I want, but so low resources. I might swipe to get one character but the problem is that there are so many. Have raiden, don't need yae, want childe, Al haithm, dehya, kaveh, scara, faruzan, kusa and gonna want another one soon lmao. Hyv milking us
                Wait. She'll come in the second half no?
            I think that both of them at the same time are unlikely, but as phase 1 and phase 2 banners, back-to-back, sure.
        "Why did you abandon me?!".

"I gave you the chance to learn from my mistakes".
            Okay fuck, that sounds *awesome*. Now I'll be disappointed if I don't hear it in-game.
        Doubt.
        Oh my god, yes, that would explain >!leaked double banner of him and her! Family reunion!!<
            There has been no leaked double banner. Only speculation
    Probably not, but having Scaramouche interact and possibly reconcile with Ei would bring a proper closure to his character's story.
    Sumeru would probably consider it as an invasion.
        Foreign heads of state can visit without it counting as invasion
            *Ei visits Sumeru*

“This means war!!!”
        Just say she is there on invitation of their archon
        Not like they can do anything about it
It's the opulent dreams feather?
    yes, the whole Husk set lore is apparently about him
        the headpiece literally looks like his hat
mummy's boy
    Well are there a second option?
Man, these details makes me feel like I watched spoilers.
Tbh i didnt expect him to be anemo considering he is related with the Shogun
    same, but consider the fact that he never used some kind of electro power(using vision or something as far as I remember).
        Consider irl mythology with Raijin where there is a wind counterpart named Fujin and are always together in depictions
u/dawttore they even added little significant details bro
    THEY ALWAYS MAKE RLLY THOUGHFUK DESIGNS
        bro wth i found you in the mbti and geshin posts stick to one /s
            that's because we're amazing and famous and like multiple things got anything against that my man?
                No bro you just scare me
                    it's okay bro you'll get used to it💯💯
                        Thank you bro 😔
                    u sound like a 89yo who just discovered the internet
                        You blew my cover youngster
                            my bad thats just what i do grandpa 👴🏻
                                Alright kiddo 🧒
this is why you read the dialogues and a little bit in lore
    Yea, dw I read through all the lore. Sucks that its hidden behind artifact lore tbh.
        Thinking about it, I’m kind of behind on lore these days (college and all that). I should probably catch up as soon as possible.
Can anyone fill me in as to how is it related to Raiden exactly?
    Ei gave it to him after he was sent to a deep sleep in the Slumbering Court(domain) in Seirai Island, after he was re-awakened (for unkown reasons) he met the young bladesmith (related to the Kaedehara clan) which then told him:

"This gold ornament is a proof of identity granted by the Almighty Shogun,"
"But as you travel the world, please bear this in mind,"
"Never to reveal your identity to others."
        Got it, thanks! Man I really need to catch up with my artifact lore…
maybe it's one of those kiddie alarm thing

ei: if you met any suspicious person, say, like a hulking red oni that looks like he'll mug your pocket money, pull the tailfeather. a loud alarm will sound and a thunderbolt will strike that person
    Scaramouche: And I’ve been using it ever since
The more I look at it the more it fells we'll power of friendship him so hard he stops beeing evil instead of beating the gnosis out of him.
So we beat him so hard he changes colors? Damn.
My boy actually has a heart!
Is he anemo now?
    as a playable character, yes. anemo catalyst
Every child is related to his mom. What are you talking about!
    Except no one knows that he's related to the shogun. They will only when they see that golden ornament because that thing is granted by the Shogun herself.

Ei gave it to him after he was sent to a deep sleep in the Slumbering Court(domain) in Seirai Island, after he was re-awakened (for unkown reasons) he met the young bladesmith (related to the Kaedehara clan) which then told him:

"This gold ornament is a proof of identity granted by the Almighty Shogun," "But as you travel the world, please bear this in mind," "Never to reveal your identity to others."
Ok at least they changed his costume aesthetic all together. The original uniform was too electro for anemo element
i wonder how they will make him good now, as i dont see any potential redemption ark for him other than getting a factory reset by Ei
    They don't have to make him good or give him a redemption arc. Childe is still very much a bad person who will actively try and kill us and others if we get in the way of him and the tsaritsa despite being playable and I expect Scaramouche to be the same.
        but childe is likable and is shown to care for his family, scara is just a dick that actively hates us and everyone around him while balming other people for his problems.
            some people just enjoy being stepped on
                indeed, remember kazuha's friend who want to get musou'd?
            Look some of us enjoy the little rage-gremlin ok.

Also ironically Childe's family plotline in his story quest made me like him way less, Teucer is a little shit and Childe needs to stop coddling him that much
                now I want to roll on him just so I can save a team called raging gremlin's
    He shouldn't nor does he need one, but a redemption arc that doesn't involve a factory reset isn't theoretically impossible. Redemption always comes from the initiative of the character that will go through it, so as long as Scaramouche himself takes the initiative to change, or decides to chart a new course in life after a realization, his redemption arc will instantly kickstart.

What people don't get is that neither the audience nor the setting and cast of a story gets to decide whether a character should be redeemed or not. The only one who decides whether that character will get redeemed is the character itself
    >!According to leaks he factory resets himself after losing, deleting all his data from Teyvat central server but because the Traveler is not from Teyvat and accesses the server with a special ID, the Traveler is unaffected and downloaded his data on a pocket SSD. Later in his story quest the Traveler helps him recover his data.!<
    Don’t think he was ever evil tho, I think he just didn’t have anyone to guide and teach him so he took a detour. But I think he’s still gonna be acting like a annoying angry lil boy
    We don't need a character to be redeemed for them to be made a playable character. Childe is still a villain yet he's a playable character, sure he has a more amiable personality but he is still very much a villain.
Oh woah, I never noticed that, must've missed it because of the hype lmao. I do hope the two slowly reconcile, him keeping the feather all this time is telling that he probably still has a spot for his mother. It doesn't have to be upfront too, it could be just Miko mentioning the two have been exchanging letters recently or something.
wait, was his design always blue?
    he's been redesigned since he's becoming a playable character
I’m ready to sell my soul to get him ☺️
I will now believe he had it with him in the bag on his back all the time
    that's what I thought too, since I don't think it's mentioned that he threw it away, lol
Well I think Ei might have rebooted her babe for the traveler to play with
Where is this detail mentioned?
    Husk of Opulent Dreams feather description
        and sands
how do u guys think he's gonna join us?
What if Nahida just comes up to him to beat him up and he's like "nO i'm UnDeR tHe pRoTeCtiOn Of ThE EleCtrO ArcHon" While showing the feather
Who is that
Boy is about to undergo so much character development and I’m all here for it!
I'm imagining his clothes magically tranform like one of those card captor scene
    heck yea, and technically Tartaglia did it first in his Boss transformation. lol
He was created by Ei, and In one cutscene he refer to her as mother.

Now just waiting on fanart of Lumine asking Ei for her son hand in marriage.
    Or Lumine becomes Scara's stepmom.
I wasn't sure about Scara had he remained a butt face I wouldn't of pulled but then I saw some of his backstory and it rugged at my heart. This boy ain't evil he just needs a hug. Also it's my goal to collect all windy boys. So I must.
    Naaaah, he’s totally evil.

Though he *definitely* needs a hug.
    Needing a hug and being evil aren't mutually exclusive.
He wears the leaf again to symbolize his repentance now that he got himself a new heart. As a robot, he knows better about the right and wrong, and whatever "heart" he possesses will shift him to a specific direction. The Electro Gnosis is apparently as dark as his heart after becoming a Harbinger, so it amplified his rage enough to gain his Magatsu form like his "younger sister" puppet. But with the new heart the Akademiya would provide him (probably by Faruzan, since she is a master mechanist), he will learn compassion and reconciliation.
a shame she doesn't appear and cut him down
    Man just got released and you want him dead 😭
        Well he and other fatuis did make Nahida cry so that's one reason to get angry
            When did the fatui make her cry? Lol
                They took one look at an edited scene that appeared in a trailer and decided that was the case. Even though the scene of her crying was at the irminsul tree and scaramouche boss fight being a factory looking place.
                    Exactly lol
        tbf I wanted her to cut him down before he got released as well
            I don’t understand why people hate him so much but you do you

Edit: makes sense ;-;
                if you ignore he was going to kill us, Fischl and Mona, handed out delusions like candy that got ? people killed either through prolonging the war or the affects of the delusions themselves among other things he's not a bad guy!
                    Yeah he was an antagonist that’s his role, I thought he played it well. I’m just not prone to disliking it as much as other people it seems I’m sorry
    I don't think she have the right to cut him down . She literally abandon a child to the world as if he no longer have used . Don't act suprise when that child become a terrorist.
        That's not at all what happened, he was a prototype and she could have destroyed him but she let him create his own future instead. Not her fault he chose to be a piece of shit.
            It kinda partially her fault tho . You can't blame a child who have no experience except for knowledge to speak and a mental state of a teenager with powerful ability to be a good guy . 

It would have been way better if she destroy him as so many death could have been avoided. If you create life then you are partially responsible to make that life not harm other life . 

It like saying a woman who give birth to a child but they no longer have used(example like using the baby to get money from the father but he die and all possession transfer to the family or some shit ) so she throw him away because she didn't take his life because she want to him to have a future so she just throw the baby on the road. 

Btw , I not saying it all ei fault, scara reason to become a shithead doesn't justify his actions. I just simply don't like how people think ei should punished scara when she was reason why he become a shit head , parentless child can become bad guys
                The reason why she gave him that feather is to symbolyze that she's on shogunate, and I think it also symbolyzes that she didn't abandoned him. Ei doesn't want to kill him. 

> While he was intended to serve as a vessel for Ei's Gnosis, he shed tears upon his creation, leading her to deem him too gentle for such a task. She did not wish to kill him, so she instead sealed his power as a divine creation and allowed him to take control of his own life.[8] Despite Ei's benevolent intentions, however, Scaramouche would come to see Ei's actions as abandonment and betrayal, since he saw her as not only his creator, but also his mother. He spent his early days in Shakkei Pavilion.

And the time Scaramouche woke up, Ei was already in plane of Euthymia mourning/meditating because she's still devasted over her losing her Makoto+friends. It's more like it's all misunderstanding between both of them.
                    Makoto death give reasons to her behaviour and mental state at that time . That doesn't justify her actions and bad communication skill.
                        I'm not justifying her actions at that time. All I was said was what she's going through, she's literally having an identity crisis after what happened to her family and friends. 

If anything, you should blame Dottore from why Scaramouche is the way he is. He probably tampered with his system. Knowing him, he probably already noticed that hes related to Ei, he scout him and he's also probably the reason why scara's friends died, takes advantage of this weakness and made him the way he is. Yes this from the leaks.
                            I will just wait until we get his story quest for the final judgment tbh.
                                If you think about it, it makes a lot of sense lol. Who do you think Dottore is? Who do you think unleashed Scara's power? Dottore, he also tampered his memory while at it Lmfao. He has Scaramouche under his leash that's why the Fatui Harbingers aren't worried about him stealing the electro gnosis.
        She didn't abandon him. She also never wanted to kill him. She wanted him to be free to create his own life. He just believes she abandoned him and grew to resent her.
            [deleted]
                I meant she didn't abandon him in the sense of just throwing him away. Yes, she left him, but she wanted him to have a life. She could have just killed him. There are so many factors as to why she did what she did - one of which being a plot trope, I might add - but maybe we'll find out the whole story now that we know he turns good (which is not a spoiler, it's just obvious since he's playable).
            Maybe she should have communicate with him alot better instead of just throwing him away with no explanation. 

Also, good intentions doesn't mean smart decision. She responsible for creating him , she should at least set his moral compass and teach him not to be a shit head. You can't just let a child who have no experience of the world wander around and expect him to turn out a good guy . If that were the case then every parent should just "set their kid free" and bam their kid turn to a decent human being .
                > You can't just let a child who have no experience of the world wander around and expect him to turn out a good guy .

To be fair, she let him free to roam the world. Unfortunately he was in Inazuma which is environmentally cruel to begin with. If he was in Mondstadt, he likely would've turned out better.
                i mean, she did leave him at a shrine, so not so much throwing the baby on the road, but more like putting it up for adoption. not saying she did it in the best way, but she didn't just throw him away. no, good intentions don't always mean anything, but she made what she thought was the best choice at the time. also not every kid who has great parents grows up to be a good person, and not every kid who has shitty or even no parents grows up to be a piece of shit.
                    If the shrine maiden was there to teach him moral compass then sure I accept that comparison but no one was there to teach him anything unlike adoption where there at least people who set the child moral compass (unless I miss some lore out) so that comparison doesn't work. 

Yes not every good parent make good kid but they are least put effort to teach him how to be a good person. If that doesn't work then that on the child but it isn't the case here. 


Yes not every shit parent make shit kid but don't expect your kid to turn out nice if you neglected him. That doesn't work 100% of the time and people shouldnt act suprise if the kid become a shithead .
                    she didnt leave him at a shrine
So we gonna kick his ass but not kill him.... Cool...
Wasn't he electro? Why did they change him?
    Aside from his "old" design making him look like electro, I don't think he publicly used electro powers in the game. So him becoming anemo isn't really surprising for me
        I see thanks for explaining that to me!
    There's also a theory that he's Fūjin, counterpart to Ei being Raijin
    That's his fatui delusion, he didn't have a vision till now.
        Oh i see thank you for the explanation!
    I think his electro was a fatui delusion
Idk bro looks like a feather to me
What weapon type is he???
    catalyst
That would make a bangin' weapon banner.
Bro, it's a Dodoco
    Now I can't unsee it
is that a fanart or official, and where can i find it?
    It's official art

https://twitter.com/GenshinImpact/status/1587021567124307971?t=Lcgmdr2j1IhC6JWRJAFg8Q&s=19
I am more interested to learn how he got a vision!
This is a weird question but do we know if scara is going to be a good guy after the archon quest or is he still going to be hella evil?
    We don't know as of now. Maybe the same as Childe?
        It’s funny but it matters to me. Mihoyo is kind of screwing my sense of Justice though… some morally dubious shit I’ve participated in lol
Oof
I thought Fandango was Electro.
He has a Sumeru Vision. Not a snaznayan one... Does that mean he isn't a Harbinger anymore?
    Most likely, yes. I assume he cut his ties with the Harbingers after the 3.2 Archon Quest
I don’t know, but I am pulling for this man, I don’t even care. He will come home, and I will love him, and Ei and Scara will make up and BE HAPPY ABOUT IT! (cue death hugs)
    Goodluck with your pulls!
I mean i hate one of my old friends yet still kept the pocket watch he gave me. So i dont think it means anything
    Idk, I think it does, character design is different from life. In life there are a lot of grey areas that can't be explained by basic reasoning you need to look deep in-between the lines to explain something. While in games and character design, design elements are often literal or represents something. Especially in a lore heavy game like Genshin. Every detail in character design means something. If you add a detail and it doesn't add anything and just makes the design cluttered, then that's just bad character design.
        Im not reading all that. Not everything in a design needs to have meaning.  Sometimes the meaning is just that it looks cool. Sometimes cluttered designs are fun. People who think cluttered design = bad automatically obviously arent people i want to associate with so lets just end this here
            It does have meaning.
My theory is that the Traveller will make him see the error of his ways in the upcoming quest and he’ll receive a vision. Hell then decide to find a new path away from the fatui
    Sounds like a Naruto plot, but I can imagine it happening. Lol
I started my saving primos for scaramouche today.
How did you know that Ei was the one who left that gold ornament?
    From the Husk of Opulent dreams artifact lore.

Ei gave it to him after he was sent to a deep sleep in the Slumbering Court(Husk domain) in Seirai Island, after he was re-awakened (for unkown reasons) he met the young bladesmith (related to the Kaedehara clan) which then told him:

"This gold ornament is a proof of identity granted by the Almighty Shogun," "But as you travel the world, please bear this in mind," "Never to reveal your identity to others."
you know, venti really likes feathers… 👀
He kept it?
    The thing is, I don't think it is mentioned anywhere that he threw it away. So I'm gonna assume he kept it all this time
Reminds the the plumber from the Instructor set
Hmmm, kind of hoping we see Raiden again. Wouldn't it just be the best if she showed up and literally slapped some sense in to him? (possibly with la chancla?)
    I don't think we'll see Raiden in the new archon quest. Maybe in Wanderer's story quest.
I thought he was electro...
I think he is but not because he wants to remember raiden. I think he’s wearing it because it symbolizes him being a “god placeholder” and it means being worth more than an actual person to him
I didn't really notice that to be honest I thought it was just a random ornament given to him but welp I was wrong
Maybe he still secretly wants her to love him and is subconsciously doing everything to be worthy of being her son
Its just nice detail, knowing that he hates Raiden before, and now he's wearing it again.
    He is just carrying his old scars
        Hehe SCAR-a-mouche!!! HEHE
            Cyno stop making fun of kids with family issues smh.
                I cyno problem with that
                    I don't cyno problem with that either.
            Get out please
                Hmmm. I'm afraid I'll have to cyno.
            We just need a moustache  for a complete set
        Or maybe made peace with his past?
            I’d be more inclined to believe this than he just wants to carry old scars
                It makes logical sense with the ideology of the Anemo Archon. Making peace with his past sets him free, because he is chained down by his past and is trying to force his way free.
        [removed]
            Perhaps it's because he was "reborn" in Sumero, or something like that.
                Its cause he got his vision in Sumeru
                    Feels like a plain reason, but that is likely the case. Sorry, I was trying to give it a deeper meaning.
                        Same with Thoma. From monstadt, but got his vision in inazuma, so his vision is styled like inazuma.
                        There probably isn't any deeper meaning, remember that Visions are granted by Celestia and not the Archons. I don't think Celestia really cares to put any deeper thought into it than "you got a Vision in Sumeru so you get the Sumeru design."
                            Well, the ornamentation is actually done on part of the holders. Vision are literally just the little gem bit and can be removed. As shown in Inazuma.
        Scara has scar in his name. This boi just can’t get a W
        That or he is going to use this to claim backdated child support, all 500 years of it.
            Pity Ei doesn’t have any Mora.
        "I am my scars!"

- Scaramouche, maybe
            I can hear this comment oozing with Demon Hunter angst
        His old scaramouches
        you mean his old scaras?



maybe there's a good reason my parents don't love me after all.
        He's prideful is his current edgy phase so of course he'd keep a symbol of divide status, after that he'll probably just go tsundere about his mother problem.
    Hope the misunderstanding was cleared up
        Lukewarm take but I'd like for him to stay evil 🤷
            Well, judging by his expression, he'd still behave like the little shit that he is
                I wish. I want a playable character who wants to actively kick traveller in the nuts
                    Well Childe kind of already wants to do that - in a best frenemies kind of way at any rate.
                        That's the thing, He is a softie. I want somebody who will shit talk the traveller because everyone just seems to adore them.
                            Voiceline: Hello

„So, here we are, Traveller. I hope you don’t think that you defeating me means that I‘ll lick your boots like all those other losers in your entourage. If you want me to join you, fine, I have nothing better to do right now. But if you mess up on the way I‘ll laugh in your stupid face, remember that.“

Voiceline: Ally at low HP
„Move aside, sucker.“

Voiceline: Heavy hit taken
„I‘ll fucking end you.“

Buuuut. I‘m not holding my breath. That nasty little smirk is not enough to convince me they won‘t turn Scara all uwu and emotional and soft for Traveller /sigh
                                He just needs to be Xiao but not supportive. More angy.
                    Ask signora mains how that is going.

"I never asked for redemption."
            I’d like him to take after Signora.
                By turning to ash?
                    Yes.
Nagamasa: Oh no! Anyways.

>!*Proceeds to hurt Scara anyways and slew his friend.*!<
"if lost, return to ei"
    Momma gotcho back-
    And then Ei wears a shirt with 'nah, give him to Yae'
        That’d be amazing take my upvote
Maybe i'm projecting to much but as someone with a bad relation with his father, you can hate as much as you want your  parents as the end of the day the only thing you really want is to be loved by them... maybe this is why he keep it, he can't throw the hope.
lol
Reconciled stars, the world runs in a loop
    I had a dream It was my birthday
        No
            In that dream, the Knight of flowers found me
                "O wandering eccentric, we finally found you. Your sister can't wait to meet you."
Well we don't know atleast to my knowledge if this is supposed to be before or after he joined the fatui. I assumed it was supposed to be a past version of him.
male anemo curse is real
    Sucrose also lost her friend.  So it just general anemo curse. 

Hope Faruzan won't be affected.
        So, what did Jean lose?

Sleep maybe? The girl is overworked
            Jean lost the 50/50. Now she has red qiqi.
                God damn. Losing a 50/50 on a lost 50/50
            >what did Jean lose?

She's about to
            Her family broke apart.
            Honestly, probably her sense of freedom (which would be strangely poetic). She feels tied to her work as acting grand Master so much so that she doesn't really allow anyone to help her, overworking herself and confining herself to her office. Essentially removing her freedom in favor of giving the others, who are willing to help, full freedom.
            She's the one case that will lose her close one in the future
            Lisa
            Her parents divorced
            her dad i guess. Parents got divorced and they lived separately
            Family
            Technically her sister. Jean’s family divorced when she was young. Jean stayed with her mother while her father took Barbara. If I remember correctly there’s still a rift between the two.

Who knows, she might get the full Anemo curse later on though.
            her wife, Lisa is cursed with an early death. also sayus sensei vanished too
            Considering one of her closest friends, Lisa, is iirc implied to be dying, she'll fall into line with the anemo curse soon enough.
                > Lisa, is iirc implied to be dying

Nah, she's probably less dying than everyone else, honestly.
            Family, but they are together now.
            Jean technically hasn’t lost anybody, yet. Lisa has a curse that shortens her life span in return for power. A lot of ppl think that at some point in the Sumeru arc Lisa is gonna die.
        If Faruzan is>! stuck in the past, technically she for sure had some friends or family that did not escape the grasp of time, right?!< So they are long gone now for sure. Does that count?
        Didn't sucrose's friends just grew apart ?
            one of them left on an adventure and "never returned"
                Yeah but it's pretty vague  and by that point sucrose already grew apart from her friends
    Monkey pattern recognition goes brrrrr
Its just nice detail, knowing that he hates Raiden before, and now he's wearing it again.
Yes, he is mama’s boy
    [deleted]
        All the memes were actually true oml
We had already one quest involving somebody getting a vision, and it was in sumeru. But that wasn't animated in any way. I hope we get the epic cutscene of Scaramouche recieving one.
    Just imagine a cutscene like that.

Actually, imagine if it's right after we fight him (since he'll be the new weekly boss in 3.2), a whole defeat thing then just, a vision. And considering we've experienced someone obtaining a vision before we'll be able to recognize what it is.

That would just be cool.
It's just like Thoma..
She probably won't, but in 3.3 for sure on his story quest.
    Really hoping for a Raiden/Scara double banner. That weapon banner would be tempting too.
        >!oh boy do i have news for you!<
            That double banner is going to WRECK absolutely everything on its path
                If it actually happens. There has been no leaks that Raiden will appear for sure. It’s speculation that has good reasoning but don’t take it as gospel
                    They could choose violence. They could run him back to back or together with Hu Tao. XD
                        they probably will, adding ultimate physical queen to that (eula) or ayaka. anyway, if raiden family rerun will be back to back (yae, then ei and scara) and they will add hu tao and eula/ayaka in the next banner, weapon banners + most of the best elemental units will be in just 9 weeks. hyv want for us to spend our christmas money!
            No you don't. No one does yet.
            What news do you have that leakers don’t even know yet? Or do you mean that you mistook speculation as leaks?
            What news???
            Nuh, huh. We’ve all just been speculating. I’ve seen absolutely zero leaks about it being true. 

Cause seriously I’m wondering if I want Nahida cons or skip. I’m planning to use double crystals sometimes and idk if I wanna do it for her or skip cons and try to get both Raiden and Scara. 

But again, that weapon banner would be stacked. Honestly I think I’d wish on it even though I’d get a skyward pride or something super shitty from standard like I did the last two times I wished for weapons lol. At least it was jade spear and lost prayer which are pretty good IMO for standards. Just found out lost prayer is going on Nahida because I’ll have at least 950 em and I haven’t leveled my flower yet. Em goblet sucks ass though. Didn’t even level it yet because two trash subs and er% lol. Holding out hope for a better one…

But yeah engulfing lightning and Scara weapon. Tbh I don’t care for Scara’s design much, I expected it to be more eloquent with a crazy ornate design on his cape and one being in blue and the other white. Instead it’s just black shorts and those white Japanese robe shirts with the blue half cape thing over him. I liked his OG design better… so I’m hoping his kit is gonna be sick. Otherwise I may skip him too cause I also want Yelan. Maybe Al Haitham. Definitely Dehya, cons and maybe a wep for her. 

Mihoyo is making it so hard to choose bro. I went through the rerun gauntlet and only character I missed was Raiden to an early Ganyu that ruined my pity (wanted c6 Yanfei/Xingqui). This year is good release after good release and more reruns that have become more tempting with Dendro comps.
                Tbh,I would say don't go for cons since we are not getting any endgame content like abyss.
                    I wanted Nahida to have faster Dendro app but I’m thinking it really won’t be worth it over a new character. Nahida is gonna be one of my mainstays but still…

Scara/Raiden sound like a super fun team though. That’s the main reason I wanna skip cons. And I kinda want Yelan and I’m going all in on Dehya like C2 and sig if they make her more fun or do something unique. Like I’ll drop money on her. Otherwise I’ll just throw Redhorn on her and call it a day if the weapon isn’t amazing either. 

And I always kinda wanted Yae as a pure waifu pull but I don’t think I’d ever play her… I’m a Keqing main already, pulled Cyno, and I’m going for Raiden so she seems unnecessary. Al Haitham exists also…

Mihoyo is really fucking us with these banners. Like damn they had 3.0 and dednro like it’s a big new thing to sell tighnari and cash in on Zhongli/Ganyu reruns. Now we’re going full in on crazy new characters and hype ass reruns back to back to back.
                        Fr, so many character I want, but so low resources. I might swipe to get one character but the problem is that there are so many. Have raiden, don't need yae, want childe, Al haithm, dehya, kaveh, scara, faruzan, kusa and gonna want another one soon lmao. Hyv milking us
            Wait. She'll come in the second half no?
        I think that both of them at the same time are unlikely, but as phase 1 and phase 2 banners, back-to-back, sure.
    "Why did you abandon me?!".

"I gave you the chance to learn from my mistakes".
        Okay fuck, that sounds *awesome*. Now I'll be disappointed if I don't hear it in-game.
    Doubt.
    Oh my god, yes, that would explain >!leaked double banner of him and her! Family reunion!!<
        There has been no leaked double banner. Only speculation
Probably not, but having Scaramouche interact and possibly reconcile with Ei would bring a proper closure to his character's story.
Sumeru would probably consider it as an invasion.
    Foreign heads of state can visit without it counting as invasion
        *Ei visits Sumeru*

“This means war!!!”
    Just say she is there on invitation of their archon
    Not like they can do anything about it
yes, the whole Husk set lore is apparently about him
    the headpiece literally looks like his hat
Well are there a second option?
same, but consider the fact that he never used some kind of electro power(using vision or something as far as I remember).
    Consider irl mythology with Raijin where there is a wind counterpart named Fujin and are always together in depictions
THEY ALWAYS MAKE RLLY THOUGHFUK DESIGNS
    bro wth i found you in the mbti and geshin posts stick to one /s
        that's because we're amazing and famous and like multiple things got anything against that my man?
            No bro you just scare me
                it's okay bro you'll get used to it💯💯
                    Thank you bro 😔
                u sound like a 89yo who just discovered the internet
                    You blew my cover youngster
                        my bad thats just what i do grandpa 👴🏻
                            Alright kiddo 🧒
Yea, dw I read through all the lore. Sucks that its hidden behind artifact lore tbh.
    Thinking about it, I’m kind of behind on lore these days (college and all that). I should probably catch up as soon as possible.
Ei gave it to him after he was sent to a deep sleep in the Slumbering Court(domain) in Seirai Island, after he was re-awakened (for unkown reasons) he met the young bladesmith (related to the Kaedehara clan) which then told him:

"This gold ornament is a proof of identity granted by the Almighty Shogun,"
"But as you travel the world, please bear this in mind,"
"Never to reveal your identity to others."
    Got it, thanks! Man I really need to catch up with my artifact lore…
Scaramouche: And I’ve been using it ever since
as a playable character, yes. anemo catalyst
Except no one knows that he's related to the shogun. They will only when they see that golden ornament because that thing is granted by the Shogun herself.

They don't have to make him good or give him a redemption arc. Childe is still very much a bad person who will actively try and kill us and others if we get in the way of him and the tsaritsa despite being playable and I expect Scaramouche to be the same.
    but childe is likable and is shown to care for his family, scara is just a dick that actively hates us and everyone around him while balming other people for his problems.
        some people just enjoy being stepped on
            indeed, remember kazuha's friend who want to get musou'd?
        Look some of us enjoy the little rage-gremlin ok.

Also ironically Childe's family plotline in his story quest made me like him way less, Teucer is a little shit and Childe needs to stop coddling him that much
            now I want to roll on him just so I can save a team called raging gremlin's
He shouldn't nor does he need one, but a redemption arc that doesn't involve a factory reset isn't theoretically impossible. Redemption always comes from the initiative of the character that will go through it, so as long as Scaramouche himself takes the initiative to change, or decides to chart a new course in life after a realization, his redemption arc will instantly kickstart.

What people don't get is that neither the audience nor the setting and cast of a story gets to decide whether a character should be redeemed or not. The only one who decides whether that character will get redeemed is the character itself
>!According to leaks he factory resets himself after losing, deleting all his data from Teyvat central server but because the Traveler is not from Teyvat and accesses the server with a special ID, the Traveler is unaffected and downloaded his data on a pocket SSD. Later in his story quest the Traveler helps him recover his data.!<
Don’t think he was ever evil tho, I think he just didn’t have anyone to guide and teach him so he took a detour. But I think he’s still gonna be acting like a annoying angry lil boy
We don't need a character to be redeemed for them to be made a playable character. Childe is still a villain yet he's a playable character, sure he has a more amiable personality but he is still very much a villain.
he's been redesigned since he's becoming a playable character
that's what I thought too, since I don't think it's mentioned that he threw it away, lol
Husk of Opulent Dreams feather description
    and sands
heck yea, and technically Tartaglia did it first in his Boss transformation. lol
Or Lumine becomes Scara's stepmom.
Naaaah, he’s totally evil.

Though he *definitely* needs a hug.
Needing a hug and being evil aren't mutually exclusive.
Man just got released and you want him dead 😭
    Well he and other fatuis did make Nahida cry so that's one reason to get angry
        When did the fatui make her cry? Lol
            They took one look at an edited scene that appeared in a trailer and decided that was the case. Even though the scene of her crying was at the irminsul tree and scaramouche boss fight being a factory looking place.
                Exactly lol
    tbf I wanted her to cut him down before he got released as well
        I don’t understand why people hate him so much but you do you

Edit: makes sense ;-;
            if you ignore he was going to kill us, Fischl and Mona, handed out delusions like candy that got ? people killed either through prolonging the war or the affects of the delusions themselves among other things he's not a bad guy!
                Yeah he was an antagonist that’s his role, I thought he played it well. I’m just not prone to disliking it as much as other people it seems I’m sorry
I don't think she have the right to cut him down . She literally abandon a child to the world as if he no longer have used . Don't act suprise when that child become a terrorist.
    That's not at all what happened, he was a prototype and she could have destroyed him but she let him create his own future instead. Not her fault he chose to be a piece of shit.
        It kinda partially her fault tho . You can't blame a child who have no experience except for knowledge to speak and a mental state of a teenager with powerful ability to be a good guy . 

It would have been way better if she destroy him as so many death could have been avoided. If you create life then you are partially responsible to make that life not harm other life . 

It like saying a woman who give birth to a child but they no longer have used(example like using the baby to get money from the father but he die and all possession transfer to the family or some shit ) so she throw him away because she didn't take his life because she want to him to have a future so she just throw the baby on the road. 

Btw , I not saying it all ei fault, scara reason to become a shithead doesn't justify his actions. I just simply don't like how people think ei should punished scara when she was reason why he become a shit head , parentless child can become bad guys
            The reason why she gave him that feather is to symbolyze that she's on shogunate, and I think it also symbolyzes that she didn't abandoned him. Ei doesn't want to kill him. 

> While he was intended to serve as a vessel for Ei's Gnosis, he shed tears upon his creation, leading her to deem him too gentle for such a task. She did not wish to kill him, so she instead sealed his power as a divine creation and allowed him to take control of his own life.[8] Despite Ei's benevolent intentions, however, Scaramouche would come to see Ei's actions as abandonment and betrayal, since he saw her as not only his creator, but also his mother. He spent his early days in Shakkei Pavilion.

And the time Scaramouche woke up, Ei was already in plane of Euthymia mourning/meditating because she's still devasted over her losing her Makoto+friends. It's more like it's all misunderstanding between both of them.
                Makoto death give reasons to her behaviour and mental state at that time . That doesn't justify her actions and bad communication skill.
                    I'm not justifying her actions at that time. All I was said was what she's going through, she's literally having an identity crisis after what happened to her family and friends. 

If anything, you should blame Dottore from why Scaramouche is the way he is. He probably tampered with his system. Knowing him, he probably already noticed that hes related to Ei, he scout him and he's also probably the reason why scara's friends died, takes advantage of this weakness and made him the way he is. Yes this from the leaks.
                        I will just wait until we get his story quest for the final judgment tbh.
                            If you think about it, it makes a lot of sense lol. Who do you think Dottore is? Who do you think unleashed Scara's power? Dottore, he also tampered his memory while at it Lmfao. He has Scaramouche under his leash that's why the Fatui Harbingers aren't worried about him stealing the electro gnosis.
    She didn't abandon him. She also never wanted to kill him. She wanted him to be free to create his own life. He just believes she abandoned him and grew to resent her.
        [deleted]
            I meant she didn't abandon him in the sense of just throwing him away. Yes, she left him, but she wanted him to have a life. She could have just killed him. There are so many factors as to why she did what she did - one of which being a plot trope, I might add - but maybe we'll find out the whole story now that we know he turns good (which is not a spoiler, it's just obvious since he's playable).
        Maybe she should have communicate with him alot better instead of just throwing him away with no explanation. 

Also, good intentions doesn't mean smart decision. She responsible for creating him , she should at least set his moral compass and teach him not to be a shit head. You can't just let a child who have no experience of the world wander around and expect him to turn out a good guy . If that were the case then every parent should just "set their kid free" and bam their kid turn to a decent human being .
            > You can't just let a child who have no experience of the world wander around and expect him to turn out a good guy .

To be fair, she let him free to roam the world. Unfortunately he was in Inazuma which is environmentally cruel to begin with. If he was in Mondstadt, he likely would've turned out better.
            i mean, she did leave him at a shrine, so not so much throwing the baby on the road, but more like putting it up for adoption. not saying she did it in the best way, but she didn't just throw him away. no, good intentions don't always mean anything, but she made what she thought was the best choice at the time. also not every kid who has great parents grows up to be a good person, and not every kid who has shitty or even no parents grows up to be a piece of shit.
                If the shrine maiden was there to teach him moral compass then sure I accept that comparison but no one was there to teach him anything unlike adoption where there at least people who set the child moral compass (unless I miss some lore out) so that comparison doesn't work. 

Yes not every good parent make good kid but they are least put effort to teach him how to be a good person. If that doesn't work then that on the child but it isn't the case here. 


Yes not every shit parent make shit kid but don't expect your kid to turn out nice if you neglected him. That doesn't work 100% of the time and people shouldnt act suprise if the kid become a shithead .
                she didnt leave him at a shrine
Aside from his "old" design making him look like electro, I don't think he publicly used electro powers in the game. So him becoming anemo isn't really surprising for me
    I see thanks for explaining that to me!
There's also a theory that he's Fūjin, counterpart to Ei being Raijin
That's his fatui delusion, he didn't have a vision till now.
    Oh i see thank you for the explanation!
I think his electro was a fatui delusion
catalyst
Now I can't unsee it
It's official art

We don't know as of now. Maybe the same as Childe?
    It’s funny but it matters to me. Mihoyo is kind of screwing my sense of Justice though… some morally dubious shit I’ve participated in lol
Most likely, yes. I assume he cut his ties with the Harbingers after the 3.2 Archon Quest
Goodluck with your pulls!
Idk, I think it does, character design is different from life. In life there are a lot of grey areas that can't be explained by basic reasoning you need to look deep in-between the lines to explain something. While in games and character design, design elements are often literal or represents something. Especially in a lore heavy game like Genshin. Every detail in character design means something. If you add a detail and it doesn't add anything and just makes the design cluttered, then that's just bad character design.
    Im not reading all that. Not everything in a design needs to have meaning.  Sometimes the meaning is just that it looks cool. Sometimes cluttered designs are fun. People who think cluttered design = bad automatically obviously arent people i want to associate with so lets just end this here
        It does have meaning.
Sounds like a Naruto plot, but I can imagine it happening. Lol
From the Husk of Opulent dreams artifact lore.

Ei gave it to him after he was sent to a deep sleep in the Slumbering Court(Husk domain) in Seirai Island, after he was re-awakened (for unkown reasons) he met the young bladesmith (related to the Kaedehara clan) which then told him:

"This gold ornament is a proof of identity granted by the Almighty Shogun," "But as you travel the world, please bear this in mind," "Never to reveal your identity to others."
The thing is, I don't think it is mentioned anywhere that he threw it away. So I'm gonna assume he kept it all this time
I don't think we'll see Raiden in the new archon quest. Maybe in Wanderer's story quest.
He is just carrying his old scars
    Hehe SCAR-a-mouche!!! HEHE
        Cyno stop making fun of kids with family issues smh.
            I cyno problem with that
                I don't cyno problem with that either.
        Get out please
            Hmmm. I'm afraid I'll have to cyno.
        We just need a moustache  for a complete set
    Or maybe made peace with his past?
        I’d be more inclined to believe this than he just wants to carry old scars
            It makes logical sense with the ideology of the Anemo Archon. Making peace with his past sets him free, because he is chained down by his past and is trying to force his way free.
    [removed]
        Perhaps it's because he was "reborn" in Sumero, or something like that.
            Its cause he got his vision in Sumeru
                Feels like a plain reason, but that is likely the case. Sorry, I was trying to give it a deeper meaning.
                    Same with Thoma. From monstadt, but got his vision in inazuma, so his vision is styled like inazuma.
                    There probably isn't any deeper meaning, remember that Visions are granted by Celestia and not the Archons. I don't think Celestia really cares to put any deeper thought into it than "you got a Vision in Sumeru so you get the Sumeru design."
                        Well, the ornamentation is actually done on part of the holders. Vision are literally just the little gem bit and can be removed. As shown in Inazuma.
    Scara has scar in his name. This boi just can’t get a W
    That or he is going to use this to claim backdated child support, all 500 years of it.
        Pity Ei doesn’t have any Mora.
    "I am my scars!"

- Scaramouche, maybe
        I can hear this comment oozing with Demon Hunter angst
    His old scaramouches
    you mean his old scaras?



maybe there's a good reason my parents don't love me after all.
    He's prideful is his current edgy phase so of course he'd keep a symbol of divide status, after that he'll probably just go tsundere about his mother problem.
Hope the misunderstanding was cleared up
    Lukewarm take but I'd like for him to stay evil 🤷
        Well, judging by his expression, he'd still behave like the little shit that he is
            I wish. I want a playable character who wants to actively kick traveller in the nuts
                Well Childe kind of already wants to do that - in a best frenemies kind of way at any rate.
                    That's the thing, He is a softie. I want somebody who will shit talk the traveller because everyone just seems to adore them.
                        Voiceline: Hello

„So, here we are, Traveller. I hope you don’t think that you defeating me means that I‘ll lick your boots like all those other losers in your entourage. If you want me to join you, fine, I have nothing better to do right now. But if you mess up on the way I‘ll laugh in your stupid face, remember that.“

Voiceline: Ally at low HP
„Move aside, sucker.“

Voiceline: Heavy hit taken
„I‘ll fucking end you.“

Buuuut. I‘m not holding my breath. That nasty little smirk is not enough to convince me they won‘t turn Scara all uwu and emotional and soft for Traveller /sigh
                            He just needs to be Xiao but not supportive. More angy.
                Ask signora mains how that is going.

"I never asked for redemption."
        I’d like him to take after Signora.
            By turning to ash?
                Yes.
Momma gotcho back-
And then Ei wears a shirt with 'nah, give him to Yae'
    That’d be amazing take my upvote
I had a dream It was my birthday
    No
        In that dream, the Knight of flowers found me
            "O wandering eccentric, we finally found you. Your sister can't wait to meet you."
Sucrose also lost her friend.  So it just general anemo curse. 

Hope Faruzan won't be affected.
    So, what did Jean lose?

Sleep maybe? The girl is overworked
        Jean lost the 50/50. Now she has red qiqi.
            God damn. Losing a 50/50 on a lost 50/50
        >what did Jean lose?

She's about to
        Her family broke apart.
        Honestly, probably her sense of freedom (which would be strangely poetic). She feels tied to her work as acting grand Master so much so that she doesn't really allow anyone to help her, overworking herself and confining herself to her office. Essentially removing her freedom in favor of giving the others, who are willing to help, full freedom.
        She's the one case that will lose her close one in the future
        Lisa
        Her parents divorced
        her dad i guess. Parents got divorced and they lived separately
        Family
        Technically her sister. Jean’s family divorced when she was young. Jean stayed with her mother while her father took Barbara. If I remember correctly there’s still a rift between the two.

Who knows, she might get the full Anemo curse later on though.
        her wife, Lisa is cursed with an early death. also sayus sensei vanished too
        Considering one of her closest friends, Lisa, is iirc implied to be dying, she'll fall into line with the anemo curse soon enough.
            > Lisa, is iirc implied to be dying

Nah, she's probably less dying than everyone else, honestly.
        Family, but they are together now.
        Jean technically hasn’t lost anybody, yet. Lisa has a curse that shortens her life span in return for power. A lot of ppl think that at some point in the Sumeru arc Lisa is gonna die.
    If Faruzan is>! stuck in the past, technically she for sure had some friends or family that did not escape the grasp of time, right?!< So they are long gone now for sure. Does that count?
    Didn't sucrose's friends just grew apart ?
        one of them left on an adventure and "never returned"
            Yeah but it's pretty vague  and by that point sucrose already grew apart from her friends
Monkey pattern recognition goes brrrrr
[deleted]
    All the memes were actually true oml
Just imagine a cutscene like that.

Actually, imagine if it's right after we fight him (since he'll be the new weekly boss in 3.2), a whole defeat thing then just, a vision. And considering we've experienced someone obtaining a vision before we'll be able to recognize what it is.

That would just be cool.
Really hoping for a Raiden/Scara double banner. That weapon banner would be tempting too.
    >!oh boy do i have news for you!<
        That double banner is going to WRECK absolutely everything on its path
            If it actually happens. There has been no leaks that Raiden will appear for sure. It’s speculation that has good reasoning but don’t take it as gospel
                They could choose violence. They could run him back to back or together with Hu Tao. XD
                    they probably will, adding ultimate physical queen to that (eula) or ayaka. anyway, if raiden family rerun will be back to back (yae, then ei and scara) and they will add hu tao and eula/ayaka in the next banner, weapon banners + most of the best elemental units will be in just 9 weeks. hyv want for us to spend our christmas money!
        No you don't. No one does yet.
        What news do you have that leakers don’t even know yet? Or do you mean that you mistook speculation as leaks?
        What news???
        Nuh, huh. We’ve all just been speculating. I’ve seen absolutely zero leaks about it being true. 

Cause seriously I’m wondering if I want Nahida cons or skip. I’m planning to use double crystals sometimes and idk if I wanna do it for her or skip cons and try to get both Raiden and Scara. 

But again, that weapon banner would be stacked. Honestly I think I’d wish on it even though I’d get a skyward pride or something super shitty from standard like I did the last two times I wished for weapons lol. At least it was jade spear and lost prayer which are pretty good IMO for standards. Just found out lost prayer is going on Nahida because I’ll have at least 950 em and I haven’t leveled my flower yet. Em goblet sucks ass though. Didn’t even level it yet because two trash subs and er% lol. Holding out hope for a better one…

But yeah engulfing lightning and Scara weapon. Tbh I don’t care for Scara’s design much, I expected it to be more eloquent with a crazy ornate design on his cape and one being in blue and the other white. Instead it’s just black shorts and those white Japanese robe shirts with the blue half cape thing over him. I liked his OG design better… so I’m hoping his kit is gonna be sick. Otherwise I may skip him too cause I also want Yelan. Maybe Al Haitham. Definitely Dehya, cons and maybe a wep for her. 

Mihoyo is making it so hard to choose bro. I went through the rerun gauntlet and only character I missed was Raiden to an early Ganyu that ruined my pity (wanted c6 Yanfei/Xingqui). This year is good release after good release and more reruns that have become more tempting with Dendro comps.
            Tbh,I would say don't go for cons since we are not getting any endgame content like abyss.
                I wanted Nahida to have faster Dendro app but I’m thinking it really won’t be worth it over a new character. Nahida is gonna be one of my mainstays but still…

Scara/Raiden sound like a super fun team though. That’s the main reason I wanna skip cons. And I kinda want Yelan and I’m going all in on Dehya like C2 and sig if they make her more fun or do something unique. Like I’ll drop money on her. Otherwise I’ll just throw Redhorn on her and call it a day if the weapon isn’t amazing either. 

And I always kinda wanted Yae as a pure waifu pull but I don’t think I’d ever play her… I’m a Keqing main already, pulled Cyno, and I’m going for Raiden so she seems unnecessary. Al Haitham exists also…

Mihoyo is really fucking us with these banners. Like damn they had 3.0 and dednro like it’s a big new thing to sell tighnari and cash in on Zhongli/Ganyu reruns. Now we’re going full in on crazy new characters and hype ass reruns back to back to back.
                    Fr, so many character I want, but so low resources. I might swipe to get one character but the problem is that there are so many. Have raiden, don't need yae, want childe, Al haithm, dehya, kaveh, scara, faruzan, kusa and gonna want another one soon lmao. Hyv milking us
        Wait. She'll come in the second half no?
    I think that both of them at the same time are unlikely, but as phase 1 and phase 2 banners, back-to-back, sure.
"Why did you abandon me?!".

"I gave you the chance to learn from my mistakes".
    Okay fuck, that sounds *awesome*. Now I'll be disappointed if I don't hear it in-game.
Doubt.
Oh my god, yes, that would explain >!leaked double banner of him and her! Family reunion!!<
    There has been no leaked double banner. Only speculation
Foreign heads of state can visit without it counting as invasion
    *Ei visits Sumeru*

“This means war!!!”
Just say she is there on invitation of their archon
Not like they can do anything about it
the headpiece literally looks like his hat
Consider irl mythology with Raijin where there is a wind counterpart named Fujin and are always together in depictions
bro wth i found you in the mbti and geshin posts stick to one /s
    that's because we're amazing and famous and like multiple things got anything against that my man?
        No bro you just scare me
            it's okay bro you'll get used to it💯💯
                Thank you bro 😔
            u sound like a 89yo who just discovered the internet
                You blew my cover youngster
                    my bad thats just what i do grandpa 👴🏻
                        Alright kiddo 🧒
Thinking about it, I’m kind of behind on lore these days (college and all that). I should probably catch up as soon as possible.
Got it, thanks! Man I really need to catch up with my artifact lore…
but childe is likable and is shown to care for his family, scara is just a dick that actively hates us and everyone around him while balming other people for his problems.
    some people just enjoy being stepped on
        indeed, remember kazuha's friend who want to get musou'd?
    Look some of us enjoy the little rage-gremlin ok.

Also ironically Childe's family plotline in his story quest made me like him way less, Teucer is a little shit and Childe needs to stop coddling him that much
        now I want to roll on him just so I can save a team called raging gremlin's
and sands
Well he and other fatuis did make Nahida cry so that's one reason to get angry
    When did the fatui make her cry? Lol
        They took one look at an edited scene that appeared in a trailer and decided that was the case. Even though the scene of her crying was at the irminsul tree and scaramouche boss fight being a factory looking place.
            Exactly lol
tbf I wanted her to cut him down before he got released as well
    I don’t understand why people hate him so much but you do you

Edit: makes sense ;-;
        if you ignore he was going to kill us, Fischl and Mona, handed out delusions like candy that got ? people killed either through prolonging the war or the affects of the delusions themselves among other things he's not a bad guy!
            Yeah he was an antagonist that’s his role, I thought he played it well. I’m just not prone to disliking it as much as other people it seems I’m sorry
That's not at all what happened, he was a prototype and she could have destroyed him but she let him create his own future instead. Not her fault he chose to be a piece of shit.
    It kinda partially her fault tho . You can't blame a child who have no experience except for knowledge to speak and a mental state of a teenager with powerful ability to be a good guy . 

It would have been way better if she destroy him as so many death could have been avoided. If you create life then you are partially responsible to make that life not harm other life . 

It like saying a woman who give birth to a child but they no longer have used(example like using the baby to get money from the father but he die and all possession transfer to the family or some shit ) so she throw him away because she didn't take his life because she want to him to have a future so she just throw the baby on the road. 

Btw , I not saying it all ei fault, scara reason to become a shithead doesn't justify his actions. I just simply don't like how people think ei should punished scara when she was reason why he become a shit head , parentless child can become bad guys
        The reason why she gave him that feather is to symbolyze that she's on shogunate, and I think it also symbolyzes that she didn't abandoned him. Ei doesn't want to kill him. 

> While he was intended to serve as a vessel for Ei's Gnosis, he shed tears upon his creation, leading her to deem him too gentle for such a task. She did not wish to kill him, so she instead sealed his power as a divine creation and allowed him to take control of his own life.[8] Despite Ei's benevolent intentions, however, Scaramouche would come to see Ei's actions as abandonment and betrayal, since he saw her as not only his creator, but also his mother. He spent his early days in Shakkei Pavilion.

And the time Scaramouche woke up, Ei was already in plane of Euthymia mourning/meditating because she's still devasted over her losing her Makoto+friends. It's more like it's all misunderstanding between both of them.
            Makoto death give reasons to her behaviour and mental state at that time . That doesn't justify her actions and bad communication skill.
                I'm not justifying her actions at that time. All I was said was what she's going through, she's literally having an identity crisis after what happened to her family and friends. 

If anything, you should blame Dottore from why Scaramouche is the way he is. He probably tampered with his system. Knowing him, he probably already noticed that hes related to Ei, he scout him and he's also probably the reason why scara's friends died, takes advantage of this weakness and made him the way he is. Yes this from the leaks.
                    I will just wait until we get his story quest for the final judgment tbh.
                        If you think about it, it makes a lot of sense lol. Who do you think Dottore is? Who do you think unleashed Scara's power? Dottore, he also tampered his memory while at it Lmfao. He has Scaramouche under his leash that's why the Fatui Harbingers aren't worried about him stealing the electro gnosis.
She didn't abandon him. She also never wanted to kill him. She wanted him to be free to create his own life. He just believes she abandoned him and grew to resent her.
    [deleted]
        I meant she didn't abandon him in the sense of just throwing him away. Yes, she left him, but she wanted him to have a life. She could have just killed him.

    Maybe she should have communicate with him alot better instead of just throwing him away with no explanation. 

Also, good intentions doesn't mean smart decision. She responsible for creating him , she should at least set his moral compass and teach him not to be a shit head. You can't just let a child who have no experience of the world wander around and expect him to turn out a good guy . If that were the case then every parent should just "set their kid free" and bam their kid turn to a decent human being .
        > You can't just let a child who have no experience of the world wander around and expect him to turn out a good guy .

To be fair, she let him free to roam the world. Unfortunately he was in Inazuma which is environmentally cruel to begin with. If he was in Mondstadt, he likely would've turned out better.
        i mean, she did leave him at a shrine, so not so much throwing the baby on the road, but more like putting it up for adoption. not saying she did it in the best way, but she didn't just throw him away. no, good intentions don't always mean anything, but she made what she thought was the best choice at the time. also not every kid who has great parents grows up to be a good person, and not every kid who has shitty or even no parents grows up to be a piece of shit.

Or maybe made peace with his past?
    I’d be more inclined to believe this than he just wants to carry old scars
        It makes logical sense with the ideology of the Anemo Archon. Making peace with his past sets him free, because he is chained down by his past and is trying to force his way free.
[removed]
    Perhaps it's because he was "reborn" in Sumero, or something like that.
        Its cause he got his vision in Sumeru
            Feels like a plain reason, but that is likely the case. Sorry, I was trying to give it a deeper meaning.
                Same with Thoma. From monstadt, but got his vision in inazuma, so his vision is styled like inazuma.
                There probably isn't any deeper meaning, remember that Visions are granted by Celestia and not the Archons. I don't think Celestia really cares to put any deeper thought into it than "you got a Vision in Sumeru so you get the Sumeru design."
                    Well, the ornamentation is actually done on part of the holders. Vision are literally just the little gem bit and can be removed. As shown in Inazuma.
Scara has scar in his name. This boi just can’t get a W
That or he is going to use this to claim backdated child support, all 500 years of it.
    Pity Ei doesn’t have any Mora.
"I am my scars!"

- Scaramouche, maybe
    I can hear this comment oozing with Demon Hunter angst
His old scaramouches
you mean his old scaras?



maybe there's a good reason my parents don't love me after all.
He's prideful is his current edgy phase so of course he'd keep a symbol of divide status, after that he'll probably just go tsundere about his mother problem.
Lukewarm take but I'd like for him to stay evil 🤷
    Well, judging by his expression, he'd still behave like the little shit that he is
        I wish. I want a playable character who wants to actively kick traveller in the nuts
            Well Childe kind of already wants to do that - in a best frenemies kind of way at any rate.
                That's the thing, He is a softie. I want somebody who will shit talk the traveller because everyone just seems to adore them.
                    Voiceline: Hello

„So, here we are, Traveller. I hope you don’t think that you defeating me means that I‘ll lick your boots like all those other losers in your entourage. If you want me to join you, fine, I have nothing better to do right now. But if you mess up on the way I‘ll laugh in your stupid face, remember that.“

Voiceline: Ally at low HP
„Move aside, sucker.“

Voiceline: Heavy hit taken
„I‘ll fucking end you.“

Buuuut. I‘m not holding my breath. That nasty little smirk is not enough to convince me they won‘t turn Scara all uwu and emotional and soft for Traveller /sigh
                        He just needs to be Xiao but not supportive. More angy.
            Ask signora mains how that is going.

"I never asked for redemption."
    I’d like him to take after Signora.
        By turning to ash?
            Yes.
That’d be amazing take my upvote
No
    In that dream, the Knight of flowers found me
        "O wandering eccentric, we finally found you. Your sister can't wait to meet you."
So, what did Jean lose?

Sleep maybe? The girl is overworked
    Jean lost the 50/50. Now she has red qiqi.
        God damn. Losing a 50/50 on a lost 50/50
    >what did Jean lose?

She's about to
    Her family broke apart.
    Honestly, probably her sense of freedom (which would be strangely poetic). She feels tied to her work as acting grand Master so much so that she doesn't really allow anyone to help her, overworking herself and confining herself to her office. Essentially removing her freedom in favor of giving the others, who are willing to help, full freedom.
    She's the one case that will lose her close one in the future
    Lisa
    Her parents divorced
    her dad i guess. Parents got divorced and they lived separately
    Family
    Technically her sister. Jean’s family divorced when she was young. Jean stayed with her mother while her father took Barbara. If I remember correctly there’s still a rift between the two.

Who knows, she might get the full Anemo curse later on though.
    her wife, Lisa is cursed with an early death. also sayus sensei vanished too
    Considering one of her closest friends, Lisa, is iirc implied to be dying, she'll fall into line with the anemo curse soon enough.
        > Lisa, is iirc implied to be dying

Nah, she's probably less dying than everyone else, honestly.
    Family, but they are together now.
    Jean technically hasn’t lost anybody, yet. Lisa has a curse that shortens her life span in return for power. A lot of ppl think that at some point in the Sumeru arc Lisa is gonna die.
If Faruzan is>! stuck in the past, technically she for sure had some friends or family that did not escape the grasp of time, right?!< So they are long gone now for sure. Does that count?
Didn't sucrose's friends just grew apart ?
    one of them left on an adventure and "never returned"
        Yeah but it's pretty vague  and by that point sucrose already grew apart from her friends
All the memes were actually true oml
>!oh boy do i have news for you!<
    That double banner is going to WRECK absolutely everything on its path
        If it actually happens. There has been no leaks that Raiden will appear for sure. It’s speculation that has good reasoning but don’t take it as gospel
            They could choose violence. They could run him back to back or together with Hu Tao. XD
                they probably will, adding ultimate physical queen to that (eula) or ayaka. anyway, if raiden family rerun will be back to back (yae, then ei and scara) and they will add hu tao and eula/ayaka in the next banner, weapon banners + most of the best elemental units will be in just 9 weeks. hyv want for us to spend our christmas money!
    No you don't. No one does yet.
    What news do you have that leakers don’t even know yet? Or do you mean that you mistook speculation as leaks?
    What news???
    Nuh, huh. We’ve all just been speculating. I’ve seen absolutely zero leaks about it being true. 

Cause seriously I’m wondering if I want Nahida cons or skip. I’m planning to use double crystals sometimes and idk if I wanna do it for her or skip cons and try to get both Raiden and Scara. 

But again, that weapon banner would be stacked. Honestly I think I’d wish on it even though I’d get a skyward pride or something super shitty from standard like I did the last two times I wished for weapons lol. At least it was jade spear and lost prayer which are pretty good IMO for standards. Just found out lost prayer is going on Nahida because I’ll have at least 950 em and I haven’t leveled my flower yet. Em goblet sucks ass though. Didn’t even level it yet because two trash subs and er% lol. Holding out hope for a better one…

But yeah engulfing lightning and Scara weapon. Tbh I don’t care for Scara’s design much, I expected it to be more eloquent with a crazy ornate design on his cape and one being in blue and the other white. Instead it’s just black shorts and those white Japanese robe shirts with the blue half cape thing over him. I liked his OG design better… so I’m hoping his kit is gonna be sick. Otherwise I may skip him too cause I also want Yelan. Maybe Al Haitham. Definitely Dehya, cons and maybe a wep for her. 

Mihoyo is making it so hard to choose bro. I went through the rerun gauntlet and only character I missed was Raiden to an early Ganyu that ruined my pity (wanted c6 Yanfei/Xingqui). This year is good release after good release and more reruns that have become more tempting with Dendro comps.
        Tbh,I would say don't go for cons since we are not getting any endgame content like abyss.
            I wanted Nahida to have faster Dendro app but I’m thinking it really won’t be worth it over a new character. Nahida is gonna be one of my mainstays but still…

Scara/Raiden sound like a super fun team though. That’s the main reason I wanna skip cons. And I kinda want Yelan and I’m going all in on Dehya like C2 and sig if they make her more fun or do something unique. Like I’ll drop money on her. Otherwise I’ll just throw Redhorn on her and call it a day if the weapon isn’t amazing either. 

And I always kinda wanted Yae as a pure waifu pull but I don’t think I’d ever play her… I’m a Keqing main already, pulled Cyno, and I’m going for Raiden so she seems unnecessary. Al Haitham exists also…

Mihoyo is really fucking us with these banners. Like damn they had 3.0 and dednro like it’s a big new thing to sell tighnari and cash in on Zhongli/Ganyu reruns. Now we’re going full in on crazy new characters and hype ass reruns back to back to back.
                Fr, so many character I want, but so low resources. I might swipe to get one character but the problem is that there are so many. Have raiden, don't need yae, want childe, Al haithm, dehya, kaveh, scara, faruzan, kusa and gonna want another one soon lmao. Hyv milking us
    Wait. She'll come in the second half no?
I think that both of them at the same time are unlikely, but as phase 1 and phase 2 banners, back-to-back, sure.
Okay fuck, that sounds *awesome*. Now I'll be disappointed if I don't hear it in-game.
There has been no leaked double banner. Only speculation
*Ei visits Sumeru*

“This means war!!!”
that's because we're amazing and famous and like multiple things got anything against that my man?
    No bro you just scare me
        it's okay bro you'll get used to it💯💯
            Thank you bro 😔
        u sound like a 89yo who just discovered the internet
            You blew my cover youngster
                my bad thats just what i do grandpa 👴🏻
                    Alright kiddo 🧒
some people just enjoy being stepped on
    indeed, remember kazuha's friend who want to get musou'd?
Look some of us enjoy the little rage-gremlin ok.

Also ironically Childe's family plotline in his story quest made me like him way less, Teucer is a little shit and Childe needs to stop coddling him that much
    now I want to roll on him just so I can save a team called raging gremlin's
When did the fatui make her cry? Lol
    They took one look at an edited scene that appeared in a trailer and decided that was the case. Even though the scene of her crying was at the irminsul tree and scaramouche boss fight being a factory looking place.
        Exactly lol
I don’t understand why people hate him so much but you do you

Edit: makes sense ;-;
    if you ignore he was going to kill us, Fischl and Mona, handed out delusions like candy that got ? people killed either through prolonging the war or the affects of the delusions themselves among other things he's not a bad guy!
        Yeah he was an antagonist that’s his role, I thought he played it well. I’m just not prone to disliking it as much as other people it seems I’m sorry
It kinda partially her fault tho . You can't blame a child who have no experience except for knowledge to speak and a mental state of a teenager with powerful ability to be a good guy . 

It would have been way better if she destroy him as so many death could have been avoided. If you create life then you are partially responsible to make that life not harm other life . 

It like saying a woman who give birth to a child but they no longer have used(example like using the baby to get money from the father but he die and all possession transfer to the family or some shit ) so she throw him away because she didn't take his life because she want to him to have a future so she just throw the baby on the road. 

Btw , I not saying it all ei fault, scara reason to become a shithead doesn't justify his actions. I just simply don't like how people think ei should punished scara when she was reason why he become a shit head , parentless child can become bad guys
    The reason why she gave him that feather is to symbolyze that she's on shogunate, and I think it also symbolyzes that she didn't abandoned him. Ei doesn't want to kill him. 

> While he was intended to serve as a vessel for Ei's Gnosis, he shed tears upon his creation, leading her to deem him too gentle for such a task. She did not wish to kill him, so she instead sealed his power as a divine creation and allowed him to take control of his own life.[8] Despite Ei's benevolent intentions, however, Scaramouche would come to see Ei's actions as abandonment and betrayal, since he saw her as not only his creator, but also his mother. He spent his early days in Shakkei Pavilion.

And the time Scaramouche woke up, Ei was already in plane of Euthymia mourning/meditating because she's still devasted over her losing her Makoto+friends. It's more like it's all misunderstanding between both of them.
        Makoto death give reasons to her behaviour and mental state at that time . That doesn't justify her actions and bad communication skill.
            I'm not justifying her actions at that time. All I was said was what she's going through, she's literally having an identity crisis after what happened to her family and friends. 

If anything, you should blame Dottore from why Scaramouche is the way he is. He probably tampered with his system. Knowing him, he probably already noticed that hes related to Ei, he scout him and he's also probably the reason why scara's friends died, takes advantage of this weakness and made him the way he is. Yes this from the leaks.
                I will just wait until we get his story quest for the final judgment tbh.
                    If you think about it, it makes a lot of sense lol. Who do you think Dottore is? Who do you think unleashed Scara's power? Dottore, he also tampered his memory while at it Lmfao. He has Scaramouche under his leash that's why the Fatui Harbingers aren't worried about him stealing the electro gnosis.
[deleted]
    I meant she didn't abandon him in the sense of just throwing him away. Yes, she left him, but she wanted him to have a life. She could have just killed him. There are so many factors as to why she did what she did - one of which being a plot trope, I might add - but maybe we'll find out the whole story now that we know he turns good (which is not a spoiler, it's just obvious since he's playable).
Maybe she should have communicate with him alot better instead of just throwing him away with no explanation. 

Also, good intentions doesn't mean smart decision. She responsible for creating him , she should at least set his moral compass and teach him not to be a shit head. You can't just let a child who have no experience of the world wander around and expect him to turn out a good guy . If that were the case then every parent should just "set their kid free" and bam their kid turn to a decent human being .
    > You can't just let a child who have no experience of the world wander around and expect him to turn out a good guy .

To be fair, she let him free to roam the world. Unfortunately he was in Inazuma which is environmentally cruel to begin with. If he was in Mondstadt, he likely would've turned out better.
    i mean, she did leave him at a shrine, so not so much throwing the baby on the road, but more like putting it up for adoption. not saying she did it in the best way, but she didn't just throw him away. no, good intentions don't always mean anything, but she made what she thought was the best choice at the time. also not every kid who has great parents grows up to be a good person, and not every kid who has shitty or even no parents grows up to be a piece of shit.
        If the shrine maiden was there to teach him moral compass then sure I accept that comparison but no one was there to teach him anything unlike adoption where there at least people who set the child moral compass (unless I miss some lore out) so that comparison doesn't work. 

Yes not every good parent make good kid but they are least put effort to teach him how to be a good person. If that doesn't work then that on the child but it isn't the case here. 


Yes not every shit parent make shit kid but don't expect your kid to turn out nice if you neglected him. That doesn't work 100% of the time and people shouldnt act suprise if the kid become a shithead .
        she didnt leave him at a shrine
It does have meaning.
Cyno stop making fun of kids with family issues smh.
    I cyno problem with that
        I don't cyno problem with that either.
Get out please
    Hmmm. I'm afraid I'll have to cyno.
We just need a moustache  for a complete set

Yes not every shit parent make shit kid but don't expect your kid to turn out nice if you neglected him. That doesn't work 100% of the time and people shouldnt act suprise if the kid become a shithead .
    she didnt leave him at a shrine
I cyno problem with that
    I don't cyno problem with that either.
Hmmm. I'm afraid I'll have to cyno.
It makes logical sense with the ideology of the Anemo Archon. Making peace with his past sets him free, because he is chained down by his past and is trying to force his way free.
Its cause he got his vision in Sumeru
    Feels like a plain reason, but that is likely the case. Sorry, I was trying to give it a deeper meaning.
        Same with Thoma. From monstadt, but got his vision in inazuma, so his vision is styled like inazuma.
        There probably isn't any deeper meaning, remember that Visions are granted by Celestia and not the Archons. I don't think Celestia really cares to put any deeper thought into it than "you got a Vision in Sumeru so you get the Sumeru design."
            Well, the ornamentation is actually done on part of the holders. Vision are literally just the little gem bit and can be removed. As shown in Inazuma.
I wish. I want a playable character who wants to actively kick traveller in the nuts
    Well Childe kind of already wants to do that - in a best frenemies kind of way at any rate.
        That's the thing, He is a softie. I want somebody who will shit talk the traveller because everyone just seems to adore them.

„So, here we are, Traveller. I hope you don’t think that you defeating me means that I‘ll lick your boots like all those other losers in your entourage. If you want me to join you, fine, I have nothing better to do right now. But if you mess up on the way I‘ll laugh in your stupid face, remember that.“

„Move aside, sucker.“

Voiceline: Heavy hit taken
„I‘ll fucking end you.“

Buuuut. I‘m not holding my breath. That nasty little smirk is not enough to convince me they won‘t turn Scara all uwu and emotional and soft for Traveller /sigh
                He just needs to be Xiao but not supportive. More angy.
    Ask signora mains how that is going.

"I never asked for redemption."
By turning to ash?
    Yes.
"O wandering eccentric, we finally found you. Your sister can't wait to meet you."
God damn. Losing a 50/50 on a lost 50/50
> Lisa, is iirc implied to be dying

Nah, she's probably less dying than everyone else, honestly.
Yeah but it's pretty vague  and by that point sucrose already grew apart from her friends
If it actually happens. There has been no leaks that Raiden will appear for sure. It’s speculation that has good reasoning but don’t take it as gospel
    They could choose violence. They could run him back to back or together with Hu Tao. XD
        they probably will, adding ultimate physical queen to that (eula) or ayaka. anyway, if raiden family rerun will be back to back (yae, then ei and scara) and they will add hu tao and eula/ayaka in the next banner, weapon banners + most of the best elemental units will be in just 9 weeks. hyv want for us to spend our christmas money!
Tbh,I would say don't go for cons since we are not getting any endgame content like abyss.
    I wanted Nahida to have faster Dendro app but I’m thinking it really won’t be worth it over a new character. Nahida is gonna be one of my mainstays but still…

Scara/Raiden sound like a super fun team though. That’s the main reason I wanna skip cons. And I kinda want Yelan and I’m going all in on Dehya like C2 and sig if they make her more fun or do something unique. Like I’ll drop money on her. Otherwise I’ll just throw Redhorn on her and call it a day if the weapon isn’t amazing either. 

And I always kinda wanted Yae as a pure waifu pull but I don’t think I’d ever play her… I’m a Keqing main already, pulled Cyno, and I’m going for Raiden so she seems unnecessary. Al Haitham exists also…

Mihoyo is really fucking us with these banners. Like damn they had 3.0 and dednro like it’s a big new thing to sell tighnari and cash in on Zhongli/Ganyu reruns. Now we’re going full in on crazy new characters and hype ass reruns back to back to back.
        Fr, so many character I want, but so low resources. I might swipe to get one character but the problem is that there are so many. Have raiden, don't need yae, want childe, Al haithm, dehya, kaveh, scara, faruzan, kusa and gonna want another one soon lmao. Hyv milking us
it's okay bro you'll get used to it💯💯
    Thank you bro 😔
u sound like a 89yo who just discovered the internet
    You blew my cover youngster
        my bad thats just what i do grandpa 👴🏻
            Alright kiddo 🧒
Exactly lol
Yeah he was an antagonist that’s his role, I thought he played it well. I’m just not prone to disliking it as much as other people it seems I’m sorry
Makoto death give reasons to her behaviour and mental state at that time . That doesn't justify her actions and bad communication skill.
    I'm not justifying her actions at that time. All I was said was what she's going through, she's literally having an identity crisis after what happened to her family and friends. 

If anything, you should blame Dottore from why Scaramouche is the way he is. He probably tampered with his system. Knowing him, he probably already noticed that hes related to Ei, he scout him and he's also probably the reason why scara's friends died, takes advantage of this weakness and made him the way he is. Yes this from the leaks.
        I will just wait until we get his story quest for the final judgment tbh.
            If you think about it, it makes a lot of sense lol. Who do you think Dottore is? Who do you think unleashed Scara's power? Dottore, he also tampered his memory while at it Lmfao. He has Scaramouche under his leash that's why the Fatui Harbingers aren't worried about him stealing the electro gnosis.
