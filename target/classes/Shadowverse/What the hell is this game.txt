[[What the hell is this game]]


I'm returning player from two years ago and after downloading the game because I saw a streamer I like trying it, let me tell you. What the fuck? I climbed to master to both modes using wrath blood on unlimited and ward evo haven on rotation in the past. Both decks gave me good matches on both modes, and now? I have lost every single game, every single of my 15+ games, on unlimited (my blood I used to climb has a key card banned, also portal got nerfed), and it's always some ridiculous effects that call cards from the deck, then further summon 3 more, buff everything to oblivion, give everyone storm and attack for game. 

What the fuck. And that was on the bottom of master rank. BOTTOM OF MASTER RANK. 0 POINTS. There is no place for me anymore. I have also picked up the trials decks, I chose bloodcraft because I like the class, but I remember trials decks getting a chance, specially on the bottom of the rank, I don't know if I'm playing the deck wrong, but I don't last to turn 7. Cards dont seem to have a fair cost for what they do, everything recovers playpoints like crazy, draws cards like crazy, generates cards like crazy, boardwipes for nothing and attacks for game, or if I boardwipe them (and end my turn, I can't do any follow up), they rebuild everything and storm me to death.

I think I'll stick to solo until they close the game (playing against the bots using meta decks from previous eras). Do you think they'll be careful or is the new shadowverse just a restart because the old game can't support anymore powercreep, so they'll do so they can build the game to this same end point in a couple of years?

Also, now it got to me, returning players get nothing. Our only chance of playing now is dusting everything we have and making a good deck. Pretty lame if you ask me.


Kid named powercreep

now get gm
    Glad to see this still works. Have laddered to GM for three seasons using this deck lol
    This has the same energy as 'go, commit a crime' and I'm here for it.
    Can I do it without the leader card?
        definitely
Wrath blood is still good in both modes, just with different builds. You probably already saw the one with Chimera and Weapon Tamer in rotation; in UL they summon Flauros + Purg Knight on 3 and then burst storm with Vania Evo + Nightscreech and Valnareik
You're playing with the same card pool as everyone else. If everyone else is playing these super amazing powerful cards, why aren't you? 

It's natural that you lost a bunch of games if you took 2 years off and are basically re-learning the entire game on top of re-learning the specific meta, and and doing it all in Master rank, too. I do sympathize a bit that you can't demote from Master rank even if you haven't played for ages, but it is what it is. Point is that you would get better over time if you put in some effort into learning about the meta, deckbuilding, proper play lines and counterplay, etc. instead of just throwing up your hands and blaming the game. 

But, yes, sure, wait for WB, it might be different.
Just wait for the Neo Shadowverse instead and we start fresh
    And the cycle repeats
        Yesss.... But at least the new PortalCraft girl is hotter than yuwan
            Debatable
    Pretty sure someone complaining about a 0% winrate isn't going to do all that well just because we start fresh.
        The Old SV, especially unlimited format is already unsave able anyway.... Starting fresh means we could experience the fun of old SV like back during Classic and DE eras
The reason you lost in UL is probably an outdated deck. The reason you lost in Rotation is probably lack of matchup knowledge and an unfished deck. 

You can't expect to just slam down cards and win. Even Wrath gets beaten if it tries that. You have to play around what your opponent is doing. That obviously depends on the matchup. Instead of ranting just tell us what you lost to.
    I lost to a bunch of solitare bullshit, the get to turn 7 and all hell break loose. I think the problem might be matchmaking, Or not. People can't get below 0 points, so even if I lose everything I'm stuck on 0 on 0% win rate playing against people with 30\~40% win rate who can't get out of the start zone.
        Nobody can help you if you don't post your deck and what you played against.
            I won't bother with PVP anymore, I just don't understand how a game can change that much old decks don't stand a drop of a chance. I just wanted to mess with my old decks that got me to master, but that's not possible anymore. I won't bother farming dailies so I can chase the new meta.
                >I just don't understand how a game can change that much old decks don't stand a drop of a chance.

there's an average of 97 new cards per expansion

4 expansions in a year

2 years you've been gone

there have been 776 new cards you've never heard of

why so surprised?
                Imagine coming back into a competitive card game after 2yrs and expecting everyone/everything to have stayed the same as you left it. In what world would any other card game, online or not, follow that logic? 

What did you expect them to not have released anything new while you were gone? Huh?
                    Tbf the power creep in shadowverse has only been matched by yugioh. It was literally a different game 2 years ago.
                        Not true at all. The power level is pretty much exactly the same as it was 2 years ago, just different cards. 2 years ago was Edge of Paradise, which was definitely a t6-t7 meta just like the current one.
                            Except it is a turn 5-6 meta now, T3 if you count blood having wrath active and Essentially a loss.
                                Not really. Maybe if you're playing the Wrath mirror. Try not playing Wrath yourself and the games will regularly go longer than t6. 

T3 wrath also isn't some auto-win or anything. First of all they have to have Chimera in-hand or else it's basically irrelevant going into Wrath early or not. And secondly there are plenty of decks that can even fight through early chimera. Heck, some Shadow draws can just kill Blood on t4-t5 if they pinged themselves that much that early.
                                    There are a lot of decks currently that aim at T8+. This one of the slowest metas since Azvaldt pre Mini and I would argue it's even slower than that.
                            >Just different cards 


Nope, more powerful cards, if it was the same, my UL deck would still rock, but maybe it was the bans? 


My rotations are dead  


Starting from the beginning again after all I've farmed in this game I guess that's how they make money, either print more broken shit, or throw away old cards. Anyway, I guess that's the way of the subreddits, game is perfect, I'm the odd one. Ok then, have fun with PVP.
                # ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I can see that you play master duel, how is this any different than master duel? Or how is this different from any other card game? swordsoul got powercrept and thats from 2 years ago
    The problem is that I'm stuck in Master here while in Master Duel I can derank to like, silver. Oh, and Swordsoul still can take some games. My UL decks here? None.
I feel like I see a post like this every year.  Don't worry, there power creep got so bad that they're making a new game.  Just wait until July!
    Haha actual facts here. Can't wait to play the first few expansions (if it takes that many) before they go dudu again
A lot of complaining here, without any reasoning behind it. Let me break down a few things. 
First of, you said a card got banned in your UL deck. The only card in blood thats banned is restless parish, and that was a year ago. The reason was, that the card is way to busted in the faster format. 
Wrath blood is extremely good in both formats but as you can expect over a year later, the decks look wqy different than before. 
As for trail decks: they are still good and get you out some wins as long as the meta isnt to defined at the start if a season, we are to deep in for most matches. 
The game is still super free to play, no need to complain about no returning bonus, play the game, do your dailies and soon you have 2-3 conpetative decks, also yes, dust sone old leggys that are useless in UL and out of rotation. They wont hand you stuff for abandoning the game for over a year. 
The powercreep is pretty strong in this set, but that was already known 4 months back when they announced shadowverse 2. We are in the last expansion of this game and they went wild with it. The balance apong all the classes is quite good though. 
As for your Master Rank, it gets reset every season (3 months). Has been like that since they introduced grandmaster back in WD(?).
The game got fast and ridiculous way before 2022.  Power creep was starting to get to this game by 2019.  Also why on Earth were you playing in Unlimited?
So you just came after years and chose to play unlimited?
    I just wanted to see if my old deck could still rock there. Not anymore. But hey, I got to see the new broken shit going around, so there's that.
        Try rotation is a bit more easier to play and the decks from the ticket work here
Unlimited is some strange bullshit sometimes. I can use the most broken decks (wrath or Hozumi) and draw like complete shit or play against the dumbest meme decks there are and lose on turn 5-6.

Rotation on the other hand is alright. Powerlevel is way too high tho, which is probably one of the reasons Cygames will start Worlds Beyond.
Adapt or die. That’s always been the name of the game
See, unfortunately the news about WB coming out soon, made me hesitate to invest any more into the game and I've also been fairly in and out.

Game is still relatively good (actually very good when I think about the mess that was WD) but that's just the Forest main in me. Frankly, I also only come on for the story anymore. The final arc has been pretty amazing thus far, I recommend reading it
    Oh, I thought the game would end on the Final Arc, I finished it, the animated scenes rocked. 


Now I'm curious about what's the new stories, since the main cast ended their journey.
At least when SV WB gets released there will come a time that a vanilla 1/1 with no stats and effect on pp1 will become relevant, but seriously like you said, game is bad right now compare to how it was a few years ago where each deck can best at least two class and weak to two other classes and now its just triangle meta and other craft irrelevant.
Glad to see this still works. Have laddered to GM for three seasons using this deck lol
