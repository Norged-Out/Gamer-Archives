[[Shadowverse Flame Episode 76 Discussion Thread]]


[For the Sake of the World, I'll Defeat You!](https://www.crunchyroll.com/watch/G8WUNGXDX/for-the-sake-of-the-world-ill-defeat-you)  


What an interesting return back to the land of Shadowverse. Itsuki and Subaru on the move to reach Gaia Tower. Meanwhile, Hiro is gathering back the original crew to bust out the mythical cards once again. Some agree readily, others take some convincing (looking at you Alice). As the two of them manage to reach the tower, they find one of the Arc Rulers, Erde. As they get ready to battle, the episode concluded, with a tease to some Lust cards and Liza! What are your thoughts on the episode?


Really like the old group coming back especially ma boi Mauro, hope he can get a close to his past troubles with Leon and move forward so he can feel free from the burden.

Also they can't be more subtle about the traitor in the OP huh? (Not like we already doesn't know)

My boys'ultimate evolution look so darn cool. Can't wait to see them in full.

Hopefully their cards will get a physical release

===========

Episode was pretty good in setting the stage for what we are getting this arc. 

But, man, that yuri between Alice and Mimori was strong lol
The whole Alice x Mimori scene got me "just kiss already" lmao. Otherwise tame episode that is more of a setup than anything really.
    No joke man, that scene was exuding "they f*cking" energy so hard, alice really wanted that date.
    ''The whole Alice x Mimori scene got me "just kiss already" lmao

  
I am usually not the one to fall for Yuri bait but there is literally 0 Heterosexual explanation for that scene
Peak is so back
By the way, one of the animators tweet the art for the upcoming new Lavaethain:

The new OP showed lots of stuff but didn't show what the Arc Ruler deck would be. If I have to guess, it looks like they will play omen cards. I mean, if they play only omens, it looks like they're going to get hijacked from the last boss position by someone.

Warden with calamity.

Hina and Andrea with whatever they plan to do.

Wolfram with a new 7 silhouette card.

Then I would bet Wolfram will be the traitor and last boss because he still didn't tell why he chose Light (with the ED, they hide someone who talks to Wolfram behind Light's picture ; maybe it explains why he chose Light).
    Idk how one sees Warden literally go calamity mode and then go “nah he ain’t the traitor lol”
My real question is why they did not send those heading to Shadowverse College with a USB so they could provide it to the club presidents there? Like they may not be chosen ones, but they would be assets regardless
Shion was so cute this episode, the alice and mimori scene was also good, other than that just back on track stuff and the opening that showed lots of stuff, like the omens.
World is coming to an end? Well I’m just gonna text my friends about it

Just like everybody predicted, OP shows that in the future Light will have Laevateinn tripple form. Since double froms were called "alpha", "beta", "gamma", I bet this one will be called "Omega". Besides him on the right it shows what looks like legendary version of Draconir, because it's head looks similar to Legendary Draconir silhouette in the OP. And since the card on the left doesn't look like a dragon card, I'm assuming that it's the neutral follower card that Mikado gave to Light.

Also, Erde from the preview of next episode looks like will be using mix of Portalcraft and Bloodcraft since he had wrath eyes similar to Ryoga.
I guess this is the season where they introduce super evolve. Atleast the opening scream at me about it.
Yugioh: Heroine has ship bait with the Protagonist which never comes to fruition 

  
Shadowverse: Heroine gets another girl (Mimori and Alice is obvious and even with Tsubasa her relationship with Shion and Ren are so much more fleshed out and close while her relationship with Light practically ended after their match aside from that one scene of her taking care of Light and cutting him apples when he passed out) 

  
Shadowverse sure is cultured
The opening animation is awesome.

I love the fact that we're gonna see the characters from the beginning of the anime more often because I miss them (especially Hīro). Kazuki and Kai being close is so cute given that Kai used to have a strained relationship with Kazuki. Similar thing with Hīro and Lucia's relationship, just seeing Hīro putting his arm around Lucia's shoulder while Lucia just warmly smiles at him in the ending makes my day. Can't wait to see more Hīro and Lucia moments. Though I have nothing to say about Mimori and Alice's relationship, I think their relationship is the cutest (No I'm not shipping anyone with anyone).

I bet I'm gonna hold my breath watching Subaru and Itsuki battling Erde. When Subaru said that the situation doesn't feel real, I was exactly like him when I found out the Shadowverse anime is more than kids playing the game for fun and as you could say something like a sport lol (they're freaking saving the world with the game). It's so sad when Itsuki starts remembering all the happy times they've spent together, hoping they all can continue being together in the future. Literally everyone wants to keep spending time with their loved ones and no one wants to be separated with their loved ones.

The chibi version of them doing the heart hand pose before showing the next episode preview is so cute, I love it so much.
