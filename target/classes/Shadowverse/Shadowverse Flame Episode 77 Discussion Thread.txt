It seems like Itsuki and Subaru may actually die if they lose the fight. I doubt they will die, cuz, this stuff has been happening in card game anime since DM.  
Not like I refuse because the 3 Arc villains will lose anyway but damn the writers want it serious  
No carding no trapped in spacetime  
You just die, the end  
And SVF is a certified kid show btw


Aside from Erude's special card and apostle of Lust, Erude's deck is pretty much the competitive template for wrath blood during Omen of the Ten/Altersphere meta. And even during Altersphere I was running apostle for a bit, and got quite a high finish (although never top 8).

Hope to see more cases of actual competitive decks in the anime, although I think only the female omens were remotely competitive that time.
    2 special cards, you can see what I assume is a anime lust card in his hand, a gold card with the anime art style so
I agree, this is a kid show so they wont die. However i prefer this Arc ruler win. Erude? or whatever is his name. Maybe Subaru and Itsuki are only become data like them and will be changed back after that.

Now we have 10 Omens but only 3 rulers, imo they need to play at least 5 or 6 matches to play all of them. So 1 will play 2 matches.

Also who think the rules for a 1 vs 2 match is fair? The couple is sharing their board, their max PP (and maybe also shadows) and...that's all. Their hands are different. And what the advantage of the Arc Ruler? 30 starting max DEF; +1 starting PP AND you draw 2 each turn. 2 cards for EVERY TURNS. Dont tell me in the next eps he will also have +1 starting EP, so that will be 4 in total.

D\*\*\* those 'lump of data'! They're only fighting kids that even not best players in the world.
    Yeah, also sharing turns is really bad in SV, every itsuki turn, subaru is not stacking ghosts for G banish, and vice versa, every time subaru plays, itsuki is not stacking gerbera bear or other bounces. Meanwhile erde was stacking his wrath pings every turn.
        Not to mention their plans are differents. Masquerade Ghost requires tempo with Gargantua Ghosts on board. While Cosmos Fang wants to bounce them back for OTK set up.
I'm looking forward to how Cygames will connect a tempo deck with a combo deck.
            Yes, i'm really on edge for the next chapter because i want to see if they earn the win or not,  i really wouldn't like if they play Miraculously winning cards out of nowhere and win with bacherus and slade for plot, i rather they lose at that point. 

But if they form a valid strat, and match their decks in a way we never thougth about, it would be so peak.

He was talking about difference in strength when telling "it's not just 30 DEF, I also have +1 starting PP and draw 2 cards each turn", so I don't think it's 1vs2 rules, it was Arc Ruler's showcase of superior strength.
        Sure, its a cheater's rule. He cant kill them immediately because this is a kid show. Instead force them to fight in a match with disadvantages. Great move Cygames!
Am I tripping or is this man Erde using the evolve-exclusive Valnareik card?

so pain is heightened to the point of possible death, huh?

well given the fact erde has been holding darkfeast in his hand since turn 1 that’s gonna HURT

i love the idea of the circle that‘s in the omen of the ten and omen of storms logos being a gate of sorts
Nice fight, but I find it hard to take these Arc villains seriously when their whole thing is "we gained sentience from a bug, looked at humanity from the internet and decided they should be destroyed". It's extremely overdone at this point, even to the point of them not understanding human emotions or the potential of humanity that you see cited again and again.

If we have to go with super AI beings that went out of control and want to destroy everything, at least make it so the reasoning is better. For instance, maybe they view the overuse of shadowverse as bad in some way, or that technological advancements that humanity has in abundance (what with all the magic holograms and stuff) is too much for lowly humans to have? Or maybe the AI views shadowverse as not just the WORLDS MOST POPULAR card game but as some kind of insane godlike ritual and they must control the world through it, using their special AI powers to make these holograms real? It would at least explain why they fight through SV battles.

Because currently there is yet again no reason. Why didn't Leon last season use his godly powers to just throw a huge rock at Hiiro?

I remember as a kid watching Yugioh, and my dad would watch with me and he'd see Yugi battling Pegasus or whoever and he'd say "why is the villain bothering with this, why not just pull out a gun and shoot him?" Like, he wasn't really wrong. A LOT of card battle anime villains don't really want anything but to win, and they often have the means to advance their plans without having to battle the hero in a card game.

If the ARC villains want to win so bad, why haven't they just killed all these kids? Turn off the power to their stuff so they can't fight back? Cause a nuclear reactor meltdown in some nearby city? Why do they give these kids a chance to actually win? *I understand why we have card battles in a card battle anime,* but it still needs to make sense on some level. 

Unless I missed it, nowhere was Shadowverse made the conduit for this power. In Yugioh the game of duel monsters was tangentially related to actual ancient magic battles. In Flame, SV is just a game.

Arc Rulers don't want a boring end of the world. It was literally explained in this and previous episode and in last episodes of previous arc.
        The guy they're fighting in the most recent episode said they wanted to destroy humanity, or they should destroy humanity and leave nothing but data. How is that not the end of the world?
            >How is that not the end of the world?

Arc Rulers don't want a **BORING** **end of the world**. It was literally explained in this and previous episode and in last episodes of previous arc. They literally say that it would be **BORING** if things end quickly. They want excitment, so they're willing to play Shadowverse with protags. Did you even watch the anime? Or to be more precise, do you only watch the anime and don't read subs? They literally already explained why they let protags have a chance with beating them at Shadowverse. Because otherwise it would be boring for them.
When Subaru and Itsuki said they felt something after losing their leader's defense, I think it's pain
They playing shadow games now.
Valnareik was pretty damn cool, and it seems like she has completelyunique new cards to accompany her (we saw them in the Arc dude's hand), which is a nice touch since one could think "why so much hypeover a 3pp 2/4 stormers that destroys a follower?". Also by the preview I saw Star Phoenix being played, so seems pike a Blood-Dragom hybrid, meaning Galmieux is coming up next (I expect 2 Omens per battle, meaning 5 battles). Those 5 battles would be the Arc Ruler fights, Woodin (who we saw obtain Leon's powers in the OP sequence (quite the spoiler)), and maybe Andrea. Very cool matches, even tho double matches are still very poorly designed.
    Wodin going calamity mode was a certified “when the op spoils the whole anime” moment
Also, I just realized, shouldn't it be just Omen of Lust instead of Lustful Desire?
Good episode. I think we are getting Slade and Baccherus' evos or at least an intermediate form like the one demonium's shown last arc.
