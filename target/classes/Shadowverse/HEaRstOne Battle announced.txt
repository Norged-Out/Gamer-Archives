[[HEaRstOne Battle announced]]





Rather more like Planeswalkers with Valor being the counterpart to Loyalty
    Exactly 
This is is Planeswalker mode
        Yeah. It is less Hearthstone and more of actually Commander with a Planeswalker.
            So brawl
                Been out of Magic for a while. Nice to know they finally made a format for that.
So whenâ€™s hearthstone getting evolution point mechanic?
A Shame decks are fixed, would be cool to experience  how much the skills empower existing decks or even enable Hybrid decks.
    The fact that decks are pre-built means this format won't be interesting for long, as soon people find out which deck is the "best" (OP, broken, unbalanced, you name it), everyone will spam it and nothing else.
        As opposed to player-constructed decks where we simply copy the best deck off Twitter instead. What's the difference?
            we can't meme build and that mean a lot, on other hand if the meta relatively balanced it would be kinda eh
            We can at least tech against player-constructed decks, and good players can always innovate, find new ways to interact with the meta and shake things up.  
Having decks built for us, without the possibility of changing a single card takes that away, and we depend on how those pre-builds interact with each other.
                I mean there's 24 different decks to choose from, that's *a ton* of different matchup combinations (276, to be precise) to explore, especially since the format only lasts 2 weeks (and you also only get 5 GP runs a day, for people who are only going to play it in GP). Even if you find one deck that you think is really strong, there's bound to be at least *some* other decks in the other 23 that have a solid matchup against it, and thus a meta forms, just like in a player-constructed format. It's perfectly possible to have a healthy, diverse meta in a pre-constructed deck format, so long as there are enough decks (and 24 is definitely quite a bit) and they're constructed to be approximately the same power level (I haven't looked at them all yet, so reserving judgement on this for now).
                 It's also possible the prebuilts are just a cautionary prelaunch. This mode doesn't look to have a ladder yet so maybe if they'll allow constructed if they ever release one.

The most important part is that rotation is about to become rather messy. We don't know if they'll balance it or how they'll do timeslip rotation as announced. With this in mind, having the hero battle decks be prebuilt makes sense or they'd just turn Unli into a larger clown fiesta.

This way, at least, it's also also easier to balance where they can remove or add cards to the decks depending on the current HB meta
        So basically rotation
Imagine if they only used characters that have canonically traveled to different worlds, lol.
Wait... +1? -2?? Isn't this Planeswalker? 0_0
# I thought we were getting Mercs not standard lmao

It's good, at least we have got things to do next month if people don't want to play rotation
Is this the last big format they promised for the game? It's pretty neat but I was hoping for some permanent spin-off mode like Battlegrounds or Autochess. Also this would have been perfect for Chain Battles, giving the mode a bigger pool of opponents with unique powers.
im so mad of this mode how Si Long didnt get a spot
I might actually download again to try this
What the fuck is HEaRstOne?
    idk if you're genuinely asking but another popular online tcg is called hearthstone
        Yeah but I don't think I've ever seen "Hearthstone" typed liKE THiS.
    Read out the capitalized letters.
        Hero? That explains nothing to me.
            Look at the image *really* closely.
                Yeah the image has the word "Hero" mentioned twice but that doesn't explain to me why OP TyPEd LiKe tHis.
                    The new Shadowverse mode is called Hero Battle. 

The unique characteristic of the mode is playing with special leaders which have their own unique "hero powers," like Hearthstone. 

OP was making a joke, calling it Hearthstone Battle but capitalizing the letters H-E-R-O to spell Hero Battle, the actual name of the mode.
                        That was honest-to-God hella confusing. Guess it's because I'm not familiar with Hearthstone at all and tyPiNG lIKe tHiS only reminds me of that mocking Spongebob meme and makes me notice the lampshade hanging waaayy too late. :/
Great.. when are they gonna let both sides have 3 evolution points?
