[[Although Iâ€™m level 76 (I guess building stuff levels you up quickly), I only bought ARK about a week ago. You canâ€™t imagine my happiness when I tamed a level 17 Rex! ðŸ¤©]]





No matter how long you have been playing this game, you never forget that first big game. I had a been wiped twice by rexes my first play through and i finally tamed a male and female rex. I bred about 30 just to have around my base for when i got attacked by carnivores. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Good job!
Yes! So much of my time (lvl 77) has been spent running in and out of my frankly beautiful base in abject terror of what might be around the corner, but here I am with a lvl 125 manta! I still canâ€™t quite remember how that happened!
Hell yeah I still remember the happiness I felt taming my first Rex back in 2017
    yeah just wait until his first boss fight
Congrats bro ^-^
Me and a friend tamed our first Rex after about 3 weeks on our server. It was an awesome feeling. My friend got killed a few times but we ended up naming him Tyrone and then got a female and started breeding them. When we stopped playing we had a T-Rex army on the rise.
I want to have PC that can run ark anyhow even on low 
I have 10 fps in minecraft on my scorched laptop
Youâ€™re lucky as hellðŸ¤£ i grinded for 1-2 months just to beat 2 difficulties of the broodmother and the last difficulty of the broodmother killed me
yeah just wait until his first boss fight
