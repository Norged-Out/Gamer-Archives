[[What is this]]


I am honestly petrified(sorry for the bad photo) 


That is what the people of Ark call a "nope" because unless youre taming it you nope the fuck out of there.
    Noposaurous?
        Giga"nope" asaurus
        Nopalolyst
            A voice, a void, lurks inside you
            Mothman? At least his weakness was a bug zapper, giganopes is just nope
            I'd rather farm it again than walk towards a giga lol
    I like to call it "MY GIGA"
A super easy passive tame!!! Equip Prime Meat in Slot 0, walk up to it. Don't be afraid if it charges!!! It's a bluff!! Keep spamming the 0 key and it will stop & eat the meat. Carry about 15 Prime Meats with you.

Once tamed, you'll have an unstoppable killing machine.
    I thought it was rare flowers?
        Rare flowers do work but prime meat is usually easier. Definitely go for rare flowers if you can though.
            The easiest was for me flying on a mount and running out of stamina. Then force landing unable to move and like the jingle ‚Äúlike a good neighbor the Giga is there‚Äù.
        Nah you both are wrong yesterday me and some friends went for a Boss fight and got it with the Red berrys on slot 0
    You fuckers downright malicious for this LMFAOOO
    Don't need prime meat when YOU are prime meat!
    I love Ark, half of us scream run, the other half say pet it. We are evil, but you're gonna get Arked anyway, we might as well get a chuckle from it
        Getting Ark'd I almost forgot about that saying
    Someone did this on ASA a while back with a similar post on a Spino. They actually tried it adn uploaded a video trying to bola and feed that lasted a whole 8 seconds from start to finish LMFAO
    This is downright diabolical‚Ä¶ so it again
    It has to be by your base for that to work
    Try 20 for a higher level
Death
The face of Death
That is a giga and your survival instincts are correct. Avoid or die üíÄ
Friend shaped
    r/technicallythetruth
It‚Äôs a giga, you gotta knock it out before you tame it, best bet is to trade for one early on, you‚Äôll end up wasting allot of resources trying to tame it yourself, and it‚Äôs very time consuming, you should really focus on getting a stacked base, tons of narco berries, get the rifle and use either tranq darts or shock darts, you can do it with a crossbow and tranq arrows too, it‚Äôs cheaper materials wise but either way it‚Äôs something you want to be ready for ahead of time. Even a really low level wild giga can really mess you and your tames up if you‚Äôre not ready for it
    Shock darts are actually useless against a Giga. The inflict a good chunk of their Torpor instantly and the Giga then drains a good portion of said Torpor thanks to how fast a Gigas Torpor drops. Best to use a Really good crossbow and arrows (spaced out 5 secs or so) or a Good Rifle with just Tranq Darts.
You should be scared
Giga



Run
It's a giganotosaurus . The highest damage Dino in the game . You'll need to lure it into a big enough trap and it can take hundreds of tranq arrows and multiple crossbows to knock it out, if you're using primitive weapons and armor . If you have a better crossbow or longneck and darts it won't take as much to knock it out . There's an app called Dododex u can download on your smartphone that has any and all information about taming any Dino .
    Idk, I thought the noglin did the most damage as I‚Äôve seen it 1 shot a giga
You should be. As others said, that's a giga, and it's highest damaging dino in the game. It's also one of the few that can break stone. Meaning that unless your base is metal, it can wipe your entire base if it aggros to it.

To kill it, you need a high level giga of your own, or find a spot it can't reach you but it's still in range, and shoot it with a high end shotgun. Without those, just stay away from it, and hope it stays away from you.

Edit: I meant high level bred gigas. A tamed giga won't be enough to take on a wild one, except for very low levels.

There are also other ways to do it, but I wouldn't say those are advisable for newer players. Which is why I didn't mention it before.
That's a dog, go pet it
Turn around and walk away and never come back
Extra large dodo
This is how you die.
Giga
It's a rock. Can't be sure from this distance can you get a closer picture?
A poorly rendered mountain
Death
Death, your time has come
It is a Giganotosaurus, a Rex on Roids, torpor tame and tames fastest with raw prime meat and raw mutton. Make sure you have a ton of biotoxin or narcotics to keep it knocked out but I do not recommend this tame as if it takes enough damage, it will attack everything in the vicinity, including you and your tames.
Why are you all sadists?
It's not a passive  tame it will eat you alive
It‚Äôs a Carcharodontosaurus, not to be confused with its lesser counterpart, the Giga (IMO). Taming it is a lengthy process. In a nutshell you need to box it in and drop in Dino carcasses for it to feed on (best to use a Quetzal for that). A trust meter will appear and once filled, you can hop on in which a taming meter will appear. Now this is the fun part‚Ä¶ go on a rampage, killing as many dinosaurs as you possibly can. Once the taming meter is filled. It‚Äôs yours. Now there are many other ways lurking around, depending on who you ask. But to me this is the most straightforward‚Ä¶. Good luck, you‚Äôre going to need it

Oh yea, make sure you have a saddle crafted beforehand
It‚Äôs about 720p
A Low-polyosauras
That is death, and I don't mean it metaphorically, or rhetorically, or poetically, or theoretically or any other fancy way, that's death, straight up
Appears to be a t-Rex (I have never played this game I don‚Äôt know why I was recommended this)
A passive tame
Go give it a hug!!! That's how you tame them.
Some call it friend but only the ones who bested it.
Yahhhooooo
If you see it it might be too late.

If you‚Äôre crazy enough like me and put a lot of points into speed, stamina, and health you‚Äôll be able to tame it
A Giganotosaurus, not to be confused with a gigantosaurus like the PEOPLE WHO CAN‚ÄôT FUCKING READ call them
It‚Äôs a dodo batman

That is death incarnate. You can tame it for bragging rights, but generally it just prevents you from accessing certain parts of the map until you either somehow lure it away without you or your tames dying, or it leaves on its own. As a tame, Death Incarnate becomes Semi-Death Sort-Of-Incarnate, which is still nice, but isn't anything near the same power level and will turn on you if it stubs its toe. If you somehow kill Death Incarnate, the meat should probably last you for a long, long time, provided you have a place to store it that'll keep the flesh fresh. A Spinosaurus would be a good idea, they can attack from outside its attack range, I do believe. Unfortunately, you can't access its other weakness of tall cliffs (a weakness almost every creature has) it seems.

Farfromgood. It's far from good with how close you are.
If you knock it out with your fist you get a free ascended blue print.
They‚Äôre fine, despite appearing scary they‚Äôre one of those weird friendly passive tames but it‚Äôs a bit tricky. They panic and will either run or attack if you have tamed Dino‚Äôs nearby, so you have to approach on foot (shoulder pets are fine though). Just walk up to it with raw meat in your inventory slot and press E to feed it. No big deal. Just make sure you do not have Dino‚Äôs with you or it could go badly.
Giga
The hugglesaurus. Give it a big hug
A dinosaur
Giganotosaurus carolinii, the name of the creature
The Giganotosaurus and his cousin to the east Carcharodontosaurus are the living embodiment of death. If you try to run, you'll die, fight, you'll die, hide, you'll die. The only thing you can do is be wherever they're not, and pray you don't cross their path. Stay strong, survivor.

I'm having fuckin nam flashbacks to my first giga encounter. Showed up outside my well fortified stone base in the north west mountains of the island, which had been loaded with advanced breeds of T-Rex, around 20, super raptors, at least 50, and Argies, about 15. I even had turrets.

I lol'd at it.... and went to go clear the annoyance from outside my gates.

...

It ended with me fleeing naked, clutching the cryospheres that contained my most recent generation of stored breeders, trying to get as far away as possible before dying of hypothermia.
The ‚Äúnope‚Äù dinosaur

That is friend. Go pet friend. Avoid pointy parts. Pointy parts hurt.

If taming friend, bring more friends. Recommend many friends. Rex friends.

In all seriousness, that is a Giga. They do not play well with others. It's a fun/challenging tame, but if you prep for it, it can be done. I think I've only tamed one once, after that I decided to just breed an army of rexes and terrorize the rest of the dinos.

There are some good responses on here. The only thing they may not have prepared you for is how insanely fast that dinos torp drops. No joke, bring a couple stacks of narcotic if you're going to try and tame that. The fear is real when you're in the middle of taming it and you go to fight something so it doesn't wreck you taming effectiveness, only to turn around and find more than half the torp bar has drained.... worse you then find you're out of narcotics.... then you run.
Looks like a screenshot at first glance but upon further inspection it's more than like a picture of a screen from a camera phone.
It's an early game bases nightmare. Will kill everyone of your tames

    Rare flowers do work but prime meat is usually easier. Definitely go for rare flowers if you can though.
        The easiest was for me flying on a mount and running out of stamina. Then force landing unable to move and like the jingle ‚Äúlike a good neighbor the Giga is there‚Äù.
    Nah you both are wrong yesterday me and some friends went for a Boss fight and got it with the Red berrys on slot 0
You fuckers downright malicious for this LMFAOOO
Don't need prime meat when YOU are prime meat!
I love Ark, half of us scream run, the other half say pet it. We are evil, but you're gonna get Arked anyway, we might as well get a chuckle from it

It has to be by your base for that to work
Try 20 for a higher level
r/technicallythetruth
Shock darts are actually useless against a Giga. The inflict a good chunk of their Torpor instantly and the Giga then drains a good portion of said Torpor thanks to how fast a Gigas Torpor drops. Best to use a Really good crossbow and arrows (spaced out 5 secs or so) or a Good Rifle with just Tranq Darts.
