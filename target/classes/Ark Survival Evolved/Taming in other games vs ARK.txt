[[Taming in other games vs ARK]]





Nothing says love like hitting dodo to sleep with a club and shove berries up its arse
    Ohh so thats how it works
    I love how everyone accepts we are shoving it up it arse.
    After few hits I dont think he will rember anything after waking up :)
    Thats very true üòÇ
    They Literaterally have an eating Animation,you feed it to them until they think "you know what, i like you, you fed me enough" only some creatures are too smart to accept you for normal food or tame out food.
Ark actually makes sense here cause in what world would you stop a wild animal from eating you just by putting your hand up like that... At least the knock out taming method makes sense cause they're not a active threat. But if it was real life neither is that easy, it would take days or months to tame a wild creature even if just a wolf
    Most realistic taming method in Ark is probably the one  where you kill the parents of a baby dino and then adopts it
        The good old guerilla tactic. Then you feed it its parents to seal the deal.
        And people say ASA is not immersive.
        Like that's how I got stuck with these kids
    I wonder if shoving a handful of raw pork into the ass of a grizzlybear would make it like me and obey all my commands without hesitation.
        Yeah probably don't put anything in a bears butt lmao I feel like that's a sure way of getting eaten....
            only if you havent beat him with your club first

Inthese case ya can go and put honey right in his butt
    Its not just putting a hand up. In the first game you run around fight with them for a while to tire them, then throw them food, and while they are eating you approach them and they either accept you or they start chasing you and u have to try again
        Yeah I know, I've played it... The bird is decent for scouting and seeing where enemies are from a safe hidden spot. And it was really fun using fire arrows to set enemy land on fire and watch them scramble like rats whilst burning.
Other games, plural. Continues to show one other game
    Minecraft - fees bones to the wolf üòÇ other games dont look as good on camera
        So a passive tame?
        ah yes there's only 2 other games in existence : Far cry ( I think it is far cry) and minecraft ; no other games ever existed, no sir !
            I wasnt about to make a 10 minute video with every game. Added one game as an example.
                i mean you have 30second or so of far cry you could have switch it up a bit (or just show one exemple and skip directly to ark )

anyway it's not the end of the world it was just a bit funny the way you justified it
        We have that. Passive taming.
Missing the Titanosaur taming
Oh this dinos a passive tame

*proceeds to murder every dinosaur around to feed it so it likes me*
Ark dinos need their narc fix.Shits really bad out here.
What song is playing in the background and why is part of it from How to Train Your Dragon (Test Drive by John Powell)
    Its mix the song from Quasimodo- out there + Test drive
To be fair, in far cry primal, you literally beat the Bloodfang Sabertooth, Great Scar Bear, And The SnowBlood Wolf to near death before taming them
    I didnt wanna show that part üòÇ
        Fair, atleast in ark you knock them out, not beat them to death
            I mean, they're clubbed repeatedly, have a bunch of arrows/darts in then, and are at least half hp.
I don't think my survivor's force powers are on that level, i'll stick with narcotics.
Sometimes friendship means knocking you out and force feeding you drugs and your favorite food.
To be fair, if someone knocked me out and fed me a bunch of pizza rolls, I'm not sure that I'd wake up hating them.
    Yeah you would

You just got knocked out and didn‚Äôt get to taste the food, just gonna gain weight
What is that first game?
    Far Cry Primal
        Damn, need to go load that up. Thanks!
            Have fun haha
                Not sure why I slept on that one, obliged!
                    Not sure if you know who Syntac is on YT but he just started a playthrough
                        Absolutely! Thanks!
            One of my favourite far cry games
TAMING STICK
The Norf FC experience
good editing. also what was the first game?
    Far Cry Primal
It‚Äôs insane.. I started playing primal a bit back and i wanted to tame stuff so I kept trying to punch them to knock them out.. turns out that is NOT how you tame things in that game
Chasing dinos with a wooden club to bonk them to oblivion is peak taming. ü§£
Taming in Ark

![gif](giphy|ou5FtFV6fwdk4)
Ark better tbh
I beat you because I love you, at least that's what the girlfriend says.
you give a dino a good trip; you drug it and then you attend to its munchies. i don't see what is bad about that!
    And then u got a friend to get high with together
        true friendship as you can see
Immersive taming should have been integrated into the game as default taming method IMO
    I keep checking everyday looking for updates on if/when it is coming to ASA. Definitely my favorite mod.
        Yup, playing without it just feels so wrong imo
You forget to add the best part of then shoving food up the dino's ass.
Bear I'm going to kill you and savagely consume your bod
Player no (raises hand) 
Bear yes master I'm your slave
Best Far Cry.
My god the animations for ark are ps2 era
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9Jgw8ogrbE
The how to train your dragon method be the ark method
Far cry primal was so good man
Build traps.
Then there‚Äôs Conan exile drag a human back to base to tame. I feel ark got it alright

Who knows maybe the way the creatures are altered, knocking them out they feel the same way those other creatures feel
    Knocking them out is just turning them off and then on again
Other games but only shows on other game....

My sister's Husband started playing not long ago. He was getting really frustrated with taming. Then I realized his only other taming experience in a game is Pok√©mon. So I asked him how he's going about it...He was shooting them with regular arrows to lower their health then trying to hit them with 1 tranq to tame them XD.
‚ÄúOther games‚Äù only shows far cry primal‚Ä¶.
What is that other game, the forst one shown
song?
Should've used the parent killing tame footage
You're my friend now do not resist
Other games: I'm gonna be your friend.
Ark: I'm gonna break your will.
Great meme
Man, Far Cry Primal was great and didn't get the love it deserved when it released.
"Other games"
*Shows ONLY FarCry Primal clips*
All those taming animations were from one game.

Far cry primal
There can only be one apex predator on this island, and it aint no titanosaur
Yooooo chill! ü§öüèº
The music for ARK üíÄü§ÆüíÄü§Æ
This brought back a memory of me and my lil bro trying to tame a high lvl Parasaur with clubs when our mom walked in. You can guess how that conversation went lol
Taming in ark:me taming beating the animal with a club love me!!!!
Ohh so thats how it works
I love how everyone accepts we are shoving it up it arse.
After few hits I dont think he will rember anything after waking up :)

    Yeah I know, I've played it... The bird is decent for scouting and seeing where enemies are from a safe hidden spot. And it was really fun using fire arrows to set enemy land on fire and watch them scramble like rats whilst burning.

    ah yes there's only 2 other games in existence : Far cry ( I think it is far cry) and minecraft ; no other games ever existed, no sir !
