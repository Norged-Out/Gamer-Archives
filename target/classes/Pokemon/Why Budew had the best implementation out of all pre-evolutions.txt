[[Why Budew had the best implementation out of all pre-evolutions]]


It's been a while since we've had a pre-evolution to a Pokémon hasn't it? While some would be fine if it stayed that way, seeing them as pointless. I think that one Pokémon in particular showed how they could be used during their debut and that's Budew.

Being the pre-evolved form of Roselia, Budew debuted in Diamond and Pearl and could be found early on in Route 204 which was an area you could go to before the first gym. The first gym itself being the Rock type using Roark. With it's Grass/Poison typing and having access to the fine enough Mega Drain. It would be a good choice against Roark for those who had chosen a Chimchar.

However, if they had put in Roselia, with it having a high 100 Special Attack, it would've made Roark too easy even for early game.

Thinking about how they implemented Budew into that game. I came to the conclusion that if we ever get any new pre-evolutions in the future, they should be Pokemon you get in the early game. A means to access older Pokemon without making the start of the game too easy.

For a few examples...

* Let's say you wanted to have players be able to get Scyther at the start of the game. It'd be overkill to have the fella on Route 1, but if you gave the mantis it's own pre-evolution, you'd be able to let players get it while keeping things balanced. (Also sure you could get the powerful and non baby Flamigo early on in Scarlet and Violet but it was off the beaten path.)
* Another example could be that you want to reward a player for exploring with Duraludon being found in an optional area that's blocked off until the first badge. However, that 535 BST on a Steel/Dragon would make it too OP. So why not give it a cute little pre-evolution that's pure steel for players to train up to... I guess level 34
* Two more examples where I had the idea of them being made into retroactive examples of a certain archetype
   * Yanma getting a pre-evolution to have its line act as an Early Three Stage Bug line in the vein of Vikavolt and Orbeetle
   * Tangela’s pre-evolution from GS’s beta being brought back so it could take on the role of an Early Plant Pokémon akin to Bellsproute and Oddish alongside the Cherrim line which gets an evolution

Also helps that it'd bring some variety to the early game as well.

Given that in Black and White 2, they had Elekid and Magby be found early on in Virbank Complex, had Pichu in Route 1 for the Alola games, Mime Jr. in USUM's version of Hau'oli City, etc. it seems that Game Freak seems to realize that as well. But keep in mind that it wasn't the case when they first appeared, they were mostly only found via breeding.

So in conclusion, Budew was implemented the best because it let players use a past Pokémon encountered later without breaking the early game and if Game Freak were to make new pre-evolutions, they should be made early game like Budew. 


Bedew also gets points for cuteness and originality
    Budew is so fucking precious
        I know, right?
    I never realized budew had red and blue on the inside of its little sprout that would becomes roselia's roses until my sister used one in BDSP. Such a fun little detail you'll almost never notice.
        Omg!! I did not know this, thanks for sharing. What a lovely detail.
    Indeed
    I love budew! ❤️
        How did you get that flair?
    i didn't know it was a pre-evolution until now

most of them feel more forced, like they just took X and made it small and "cute"
        Yeah, Roselia was originally a standalone Pokémon with no pre-evolution and no evolution in Gen 3.

Then the next generation they gave it both at once and made it a three-stage evolutionary family. I don’t think they’ve done that with any other Pokémon aside from Roselia (and it was done excellently).
            The only other similar scenario I can think of is Magmar & Electabuzz getting pre-evo forms in Gen 2, then a final evolution in Gen 4, I think you may be right that it's never happened simultaneously for any other evo line
                Chansey gets an evo in Gen 2 and a pre-evo in Gen 4.
Yanma is begging for a water-bug pre-evolution.  Dragonflies spend most of their lives as nymphs that live in the water.  They only really emerge from the water just to mate before they die.
    Yanymph, a water/bug type?
        Make it a dragon type instead, just because.
            A baby water/dragon? Sounds good.
    I also want Gligar to get a pure Ground pre-evolution.
    Yeah but they have a 90% success rate hunting when as a dragon fly
        I'm not sure that I follow.  I'm talking about a baby form of Yanma that matches Yanma's inspiration.  What does that have to do with the success rate of a dragonfly when hunting?
            You were saying that dragonflys only spend a short time as dagonflys instead of as nymphs and I'm just saying but yeah dragonflys are really fucking bad ass.

I mean so are nymphs too. But still.
                I mean, they'll stay in the water as nymphs for up to five to seven years, and molt up to seventeen times before emerging as adults.  As adults, they only live for a few weeks, or up to a few months, before dying.

It's not really a commentary on their hunting habits or how badass they are, as they're carnivorous hunters at all stages of life, just that there's cause for a water-based pre-evolution for yanma.

tbh, retconning Yanmega as a bug-dragon type, or at least giving it a bug-dragon Mega would make for a neat cycle, starting from a water-bug baby to a flying-bug adolescent, to a dragon-bug final form.
                    thank you for teaching me something today on a pokémon post lol
That early Budew made Roserade into one of the main pillars in my team for D/S and made be go out of my way to get a Roseila In Sw/Sh. Super influential baby.
    So influential, I made it one of my main personality traits
        Name checks out
So the internet was not quite as developed when Diamond and Pearl came out, and I didn't realize for quite a bit that Budew turned into Roselia. I remember at one point thinking "oh, interesting that Budew and Roserade are so close in the Pokedex!"
Fun how you mention D/P/PT because they also did the worse job with introducing a baby Pokémon, Munchlax. I won’t talk too much about it but the honey trees are a nightmare
    Thanks God DS-GBA connection is a thing
        Is it? Munchlax is a Gen 4 Pokemon
            You could just hatch an egg from an Snorlax from Fire Red or Leaf Green
                I don’t remember if Pal Park can transfer eggs, but even if it could, it wouldn’t matter because that will be a Snorlax egg, not a munchlax egg since it needs Snorlax to hold a full incense to get a munchlax egg
                    No, it couldnt. You transfer an Snorlax and then breed an egg in Sinnoh with holding incense.
                        Man I can access Pal Park in the post game, at which point I will have all six members of the team. The fastest way would be to transfer a Snorlax from HGSS
                            HGSS came like 2 years after than DP so a bit hard. 

I didnt say you could do it before finishing the game. It was your best option to complete the pokedex

PD: In HGSS Snorlax is in postgame too
                                Yeah at the time it would have been the safest bet. At least now it’s a bit easy
Don't forget about Riolu on Floccesy Ranch in B2W2! I think that's the earliest Baby Pokemon you could've gotten in any game...
    You can find Riolu early on in XY too, though it's less useful since you get a free mega Lucario eventually.
    Earlier than hatching the Togepi egg in Gen 2?

I never played B2W2 so I'm not sure how that compares as far as pacing, but if you hatch the Togepi egg as soon as you get it then you basically get a baby Pokemon right after the tutorial/intro sequence.
        Yes. To put it in perspective of Johto, Riolu appears in what is essentially Dark Cave. He appears before the first gym even opens, past two *extremely* short routes.
            But would it be earlier than the Pichu catchable on Route 1 in the grass next to Iki Town in SuMo (or in grass earlier in the Route in USUM)?
Johto, put a pre evo to onix in the pitch black cave before gym 1
    Wdym? Onix is the preevolution... It has 345 BST but half of that is in defense. The OP's example is how the previous base form would over perform if placed early but Onix wouldn't function that way with its 45 attack and 70 speed. 

Even if you're trying to avoid players getting an early steelix, you'd just put the iron coat farther in the game but I doubt GF are putting that much effort into a re-remaster of Johto.
        But I want a cute little rock snek.
            Make it an evolution to Steelix. Huge monster gets compacted into super dense worm.
                tiny antimatter worm weighs as much as 1400 steelixes
            Valid!
        It is interesting because Onix seems like a pretty intimidating Pokemon, but their stats are pathetic. 

I watched a great video essay about how Onix was specifically designed to be an early boss as Brock’s ace, and their weak stats are part of that. Good for playing through the game, but not so great from a competitive standpoint. 

But that goes for a lot of Pokemon that can’t evolve - some of them are great for when you get them, but the lack of evolution causes them to taper off by the time you get to Elite Four.
        Also, you could get onix before the first gym anyway by trading an NPC a bellsprout, so it’s not like a preevolution is needed for anything.
More 3 stage evos
if yanma's getting a prevo than it needs a buff. Yamna's stats are pretty bad at base and they're abysmal for a second-stage mon.
    I mean there are second stage mons like Herdier, Fletchinder, Swadloon, Krokorok whose stat’s are in the 300’s.

Plus there is Yanmega.
        Looked up Yanmega's stats and they're surprisingly high. I was expecting 450 or around, not almost starter level.

Oh well, you can always make a pseudo-pseudo like archaludon.
So true and very valid
Really wish they made the same treatment with chingling and get chimecho an evo too :(
Fun fact a baby Tangela was in the G/S beta.
Excellent post
You're 100% right! But I'm biased by my love of baby pokemon. Would love to see a baby for Slowpoke; it would be super adorable and it would make it suitable for the early game.
Yeah that's sadly one of the few example where baby pokémon are put in early routes.

And then you have cases like Legend Arceus, where you find Clefa at the same place you find Clefairy, and on top of that, it's super rare. Most of the baby pokémon are like that, and that's a very minor point against this game, as great as it is in other places.
The best part about doing that is I get attached to my early game pokemon and hate switching them out later. So giving us pre-evolutions early game means I don't have to worry about it later
Nice speech but one thing I want to correct: Flamigo isn't a baby pokémon.
    Flamigo may not be a baby Pokémon, but he sure is awesome. There isn’t a single thought in that head of his
        I agree about the awesome part! Peak design and I had one carry my team throughout the main game portion of my Violet game!😎🖤💖
    I brought up Flamigo in the context of it being a powerful Pokemon you could catch at the start of the game
        Oh, OK. I was confused since your post was about baby pokémons..😅
Riolu before the first gym in black 2 and white 2
    We’re talking about pre-evolutions to existing Pokemon and Riolu and Lucario were introduced in the same generation
        You mentioned older gens in your second to last paragraph
budew oddish and bulba goated fr
Budew gives HP Fire Technician Rosedade
Not to mention Roserade gives the player foreshadowing as to what their budew will become
The way it was introduced in the anime was pretty good too. Ash was actually surprised Budew was the pre-evolution of Roselia
pre-evo baby pokemon have one massive flaw, they're all friendship evos, which take forever and a half to happen normally. So outside level 14 or so, they're just a wasted spot on your team, waiting for them to get enough happiness to evolve into a mid-form.
    That’s not true…

* Mantyke evolves when leveled up with a Remoraid on the team

* Magby, Elekid, Smoochum, and Toxel evolve at level 30

* Tyrogue evolves at level 20

* Wynaut evolves at level 15

* Happiny evolves when leveling up with an Oval Stone

* Mime Jr and Bonsly evolve when learning Mimic
        Which is actually more than half of the total baby Pokemon in the entire series. 19 total baby Pokemon, and the 10 you've listed here are not friendship-based evolutions.
    Friendship is a joke these days. Know the basics; don't let it faint, keep it as the first pokemon in your team, use it in battle. Any form of friendship boosters (treats/massage/ held items) are a bonus.  My zubat evolved into crobat 1 level after becoming a golbat during my last play through
    Friendship evolution is such a flawed system. My sister held onto a budew in BDSP wanting a roselia and the damn thing didn't evolve until level 37 and hadn't been useful for about three gyms of time despite her desperately trying to to make it work.
Let's be real, baby pokemon are mostly a gimmick anyway, so it's not a big deal
or you could just put Roselia in a later part of the game instead of killing any chance for any potential new evolutions for Roserade.
I don't see the point, there are plenty of Pokemon to chose from in early game. And if you were to capture Budew so you can use old Pokemon then it wouldn't be Budew as only Roselia was from a previous generation and you would end up evolving it into Roserade which is the newer Pokemon. Then again, there's the fact that if you want to breed Budew, you need a Rose Incense, otherwise you will breed Roselia, which actually makes the Gen 2 Pre Evolutions a better implementation. Not that it makes any difference anymore as the new Games have removed the need of Incenses for Baby Pokemon.
    >there are plenty of Pokemon to choose from in the early game

I mean, it’d still be neat to have early access to Pokemon like Sneasel, Dondozo, Gligar, Kangaskhan, etc. without having to make the start of the game too easy.
Budew is so fucking precious
    I know, right?

But would it be earlier than the Pichu catchable on Route 1 in the grass next to Iki Town in SuMo (or in grass earlier in the Route in USUM)?
Make it an evolution to Steelix. Huge monster gets compacted into super dense worm.
    tiny antimatter worm weighs as much as 1400 steelixes
Valid!
Chansey gets an evo in Gen 2 and a pre-evo in Gen 4.
I mean, they'll stay in the water as nymphs for up to five to seven years, and molt up to seventeen times before emerging as adults.  As adults, they only live for a few weeks, or up to a few months, before dying.

It's not really a commentary on their hunting habits or how badass they are, as they're carnivorous hunters at all stages of life, just that there's cause for a water-based pre-evolution for yanma.

tbh, retconning Yanmega as a bug-dragon type, or at least giving it a bug-dragon Mega would make for a neat cycle, starting from a water-bug baby to a flying-bug adolescent, to a dragon-bug final form.
    thank you for teaching me something today on a pokémon post lol
I don’t remember if Pal Park can transfer eggs, but even if it could, it wouldn’t matter because that will be a Snorlax egg, not a munchlax egg since it needs Snorlax to hold a full incense to get a munchlax egg
    No, it couldnt. You transfer an Snorlax and then breed an egg in Sinnoh with holding incense.
        Man I can access Pal Park in the post game, at which point I will have all six members of the team. The fastest way would be to transfer a Snorlax from HGSS
            HGSS came like 2 years after than DP so a bit hard. 

I didnt say you could do it before finishing the game. It was your best option to complete the pokedex
