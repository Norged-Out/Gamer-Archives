[[Tell me your favorite Pok√©mon and I‚Äôll tell you my favorite thing about it.]]


I do not like every Pok√©mon, but I do subscribe to the theory that every Pok√©mon is someone‚Äôs favorite. So in the spirit of being nice, comment your favorite Pok√©mon (or just a Pok√©mon you really like, that‚Äôs fine too) and let me tell you what I like about it, because I‚Äôm sure I can find at least one thing I like about every Pok√©mon.

I might take some time to respond, but I‚Äôll try to get to everyone eventually.

Edit: This absolutely blew up, I might not get to everyone, but I‚Äôll try and get everything that‚Äôs not a repeat

Edit Edit: I‚Äôm likely gonna disappear for a while to do Tediursa community day, feel free to say nice things about other people‚Äôs favorites if I haven‚Äôt gotten to them yet.

Edit Edit Edit: I cannot guarantee I‚Äôll get to everyone, my hand is starting to cramp lol. It‚Äôs been real fun, I love learning about all your favorites. RIP my inbox

Edit Edit Edit Edit: I have to end this for realsies, my hand is dying. Thank you all this has been fun and I love all the positivity


Ninetales
    It has such a regal presence! It exudes badass energy without having to look tough or intimidating.
        Totally agree, üòÅ my favourite too.
    I love ninetales, just nice design and how it has 9 tails which is its name
    always felt like a "pseudo-legendary" kinda like Arcanine
    Hell yeah, I love how in pokemon dungeon, Ninetales turned people into pokemon!
    My absolute favorite pokemon..so sad that it won't be in the next game (I think). I always try to get a shiny and despite arguments from the people I play with, I like to have a Ninetales with me at all times in my party. üß°‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•
Raichu
    It‚Äôs got a great design! Plus I gotta feel bad for him getting overshadowed by his pre evolution
        I absolutely love Raichu's design, I'm much more into Raichu than Pikachu.
        I‚Äôm so happy to see Raichu near the top!
        And Alolan raichu. He is just s little guy. He is awsome with his little surfboard tail
        Same. I prefer raichu, and don‚Äôt know why pikachu is the favorite.
            Have you heard of the TV show?
    Goh‚Äôs Raichu is so sweet. One of the best Pok√©mon characters that I can remember.
        I love Alolan Raichu so much! They‚Äôre so cute with their surfboard tails!
    Great coverage for example with grass knot and sneaky fast.  Also cuter than 'chu in my opinion
        Ahh the one who shall not be named
    Man I love Raichu. Sucks Pikachu stole the show.
        Any pikachu that isn‚Äôt Ash‚Äôs is my mortal enemy
            I'm with you buddy. Ash's Pikachu is just built different.
    My favorite. A perfect blend of cute and badass design.
    I was typing this‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs the top comment‚Ä¶. I have this many brothers and sisters ?
Donphan
    Elephant good.

I always thought it was cool how it curls into a ball to attack!
        And a neat cameo in Mewtwo Strikes Back!
            I was one of those kids whose mind was absolutely blown when that movie started with a fight against a *completely unknown pokemon*.

Like a lot of kids, I knew the Pok√©dex front to back. All 150, plus three more that only the really cool kids knew about: Mew, Togepi, and Feenix (Ho-oh).

And then boom, badass rolling elephant.

Part of what made it special is how *not special* it was: it didn't have any buildup or introduction, it just belonged to some random dude. It sparked the idea that maybe there were a lot more pok√©mon, a whole world that we had never even heard of.

That our encyclopedic knowledge of every species was *nothing* compared to how much was actually out there.
                And it was the SECOND one in the movie we'd never seen before!
                    It was?

I know the Vacation short had a few (Marill, Snubbull) but I don't remember any others in the Mewtwo movie.
                        Well, shit. Third, then. I forgot about Marill. I was including the Vacation short as part of the movie since it was shown directly before-hand in theaters.
                            Ah, okay. I feel like there may have been more in that one, too.

It's also possible that you didn't count Marill as *new* since it was an existing rumor (Pikablu).
                You brought me WAY back with this comment but as soon as I started reading it, I was brought back to it and Marill and being so perplexed and excited. Before the times when you could whip out a phone to search ‚Äúwhat was that spinning Pok√©mon elephant?!‚Äù
    WEELEPHANT

Honestly, ground is one of my favorite types, and Donphan is very close to the top of my list even among such esteemed competition. The fact that I have such fond memories of its cameo way back in the first movie just adds to the appeal.
    Big dude
    Damn, you're going to be eating good in Gen 9
    Tire, that explains more than enough
    A man of pure taste in Pokemons
Luxray
    Intimidate is a great ability, and it‚Äôs cool that it doesn‚Äôt do the usual electric type thing of being fast and frail
        It‚Äôs still not the bulkiest but man I‚Äôve had a Luxray tank an earthquake from Cynthia‚Äôs Garchomp for the win more than once

Edit: after running the calcs this is nothing more than insane luck combining with my massive stupidity to make a miracle happen
            Damn, I gotta give you props just for choosing an electric type against Cynthia's Garchomp. I'm sure it learns one of the ice elemental moves but still, pretty ballsy lol
                As I‚Äôm sure you can imagine it‚Äôs never been a choice.

Every time it‚Äôs come down to Luxray and despite it having happened six times over my many many playthroughs of gen 4, I have yet to learn the lesson to give it Ice Fang as a precaution
    For the longest time I thought Luxray was a Dark/Electric
        Yeah kind of a blown opportunity there, but still absolutely happy with the thunder cat.
        It is in Drayano hacks! At least in Renegade Plat. Added Dark type because it looked like a dark type (I agree)
    Luxray's a Pokemon I always choose when I get the chance. It's got a great design and it has Ice Fang or Iron Tail that I can use against Cynthia's Garchomp. Love that Shinx is found so early in DPPt, too!
Gengar.
    Big badass ghost type. The OG ghost of course he‚Äôs awesome!
        There's a reason why its the favorite Pok√©mon of the Man Who created all the Pok√©mon (Ken Sugimori)
        He is so mischievous and causes havoc. I love that Ash got one on his team.
    I would like Gengar a lot more if it didn't replace Haunter.
Decidueye
    Ranger is my favorite DnD class, and yes the enjoyment translates
        The perfect answer. Rangers rise up.
            Gotta agree here. Playing a ranger warforged atm
    S Tier final starter evo. Fight me.
    The Rowlet line is top tier design.
Breloom üòå
    Technician is good, Breloom has a great design
        Anthropomorphic while still being distinctly creaturelike. It rides that thin line of greatness
    Everytime a favorite pokemon thread comes up, I will scroll for a while looking for breloom. Thank you for making it easy
    Yo i love breloom
Volcarona
    It‚Äôs got an elite design! Plus bug/Fire is just a cool type
    A person of taste, I see. Cheers to the Volcarona Supremacy!
        üç∫
Absol
    He‚Äôs just tryin to help people! Poor misunderstood guy
        It's so sad. Absol shows up to try to warn people, and instead people hold him responsible for what happens.

I dunno if you have ever heard of the Moth Man urban legend from the east coast in the US. It was popularized via a movie a while back but the legend goes way back.

I feel like if the Moth Man did exist, it was trying to warn, not harm.
            Mothman is just trying to warn people of the bridge!
        Agreed.
        Absol is the mothman of pokemon
    I feel represented here
    Love absol! Fun fact, it‚Äôs design is based on a Japanese demon called a kutabe who warns people about impending disasters.
        Doesn‚Äôt sound like demonic behavior at all !
            The term demon has been demonized lol in most other cultures/languages it has a meaning closer to "spirit"
Froslass
    It‚Äôs my personal favorite Pok√©mon lol.

It‚Äôs got the coolest backstory imo
        [deleted]
            It is the remnants of a woman that got lost in a blizzard. She freezes pokemon/handsome men and brings them back to its den to add to its collection.
                [deleted]
                    Something, something, theory that [pokedex entries are exaggerations written by children](https://imgur.io/a/LQBqj)
                        Oh God are there more of these
                            You know, your username makes perfect logical sense, I just never really thought about it
    Happy to see my favorite mon finally getting some attention üëÄ
        I‚Äôm happy to know I‚Äôm not the only one who loves Froslass.
    I honestly wasn‚Äôt expecting the first comment to be Froslass, but I‚Äôm so happy it is. It‚Äôs my favorite Pok√©mon of all time and I can‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs not appreciated in the fandom. Let‚Äôs go Froslass gang!
    MY GURL!!!! Froslass all the way!!!
Mudkip :)
    I leik mudkipz.
        So I herd u leik mudkipz
    My username says it all
        aw thank you :3
        So i herd u liek teh mudkipz
    Literally almost perfect starter for the region its in and doesn't get the love it deserves in newer games. A alpha swampert would be terrifying in the obsidian marshlands
Metagross
    A pseudo legend that‚Äôs not a dragon! Also he‚Äôs got a great shiny
    Took way too long to get here. I adore metagross
Kingdra
    Sniper is a good ability. Kingdra was a great design for the second ever fully evolved dragon type
    Unless my buddy really lost all my pok√©mon, I have a Kingdra named Glock that I used competitively for a while.
Quagsire
    He‚Äôs the sireist of quags. Plus I find the concept of his Unaware ability absolutely hilarious
        I have a Yamper that I've tried to make into a good catcher because of their unique ability to reclaim lost pok√©balls (it's too frail to really serve that purpose but oh well).

I taught him Nuzzle, Bite, and Attract to immobilize things I wanted to catch.

It cracked me up way more than it should have when he tried to seduce a Wailord and she had the Unaware ability.
            I think you're thinking of the ability "Oblivious". Unaware ignores stat boosts from the opposing pokemon when hit by an attack.
                Oops, you're correct.

There's a joke here but I feel like I'm not allowed to get it.
Tyranitar
    He‚Äôs basically Pok√©mon Godzilla and Godzilla is cool
    +1 for Tyrannitar
    Best Pok√©mon right here
Mew
    Adorable. Badass. Adorable AND badass!
Dragonite
    He‚Äôs a big ol fat dragon. He‚Äôs so goofy but so strong
    Dragonite is probably what got me into Pokemon.  As a kid, I was convinced dragons got a bad rap and would actually be sweet and friendly and derpy, kinda like wolves.  And orange was my favourite colour, so I think a fat derpy dragon being the pseudolegendary of gen 1 is the reason I have been into Pokemon for like over 20 years now.
        To me Dragonite is the golden retriever of dragons and that‚Äôs why I love them.
Sableye!
    He‚Äôs just a lil goblin dude!
    I really liked Sableye back in Ruby, but I couldn't figure out a good strategy & gave up
Arcanine
    He‚Äôs a big doggie! I like the doggie.
    Arcanine is the best ever ‚ù§Ô∏è
Scizor
    Technician-boosted Bullet Punch is terrifying

Also design, I love Scizor‚Äôs design.
        I agree. 60bp, STAB, AND priority? Yikes.
            Damn, that means 90bp priority attack. Never tought about it
    First pokemon that I shiny-hunted! (actually came after just only 270 eggs or smth!)
Umbreon
    Elite shiny, I like that he‚Äôs a tanky eeveelution
    Same just always feels like his tm pool could get some love tho when I actually want to use them
rowlet
    He‚Äôs a good round owl boi
        very true
    They look like an apple wearing a bowtie and I love them for it
Ampharos!!
    I searched the whole thread to find another Ampharos supporter, top tier, and I'm excited to have the line back in Scarlet/Violet
        When I tell you I screamed when I saw mareep!
            Same, I'm so excited to transfer over my old boy from SoulSilver
        Ampharos is the best
        It's my favorite too! My boyfriend caught me a shiny in Shining Pearl that I'm looking forward to using in ranked battles whenever home gets updated
    My favorite too!
Rayquaza
    Cool design, terrifying mega
        Dude broke the competitive game

And was rewarded with a Mega
            A mega which then broke the competitive game
Slowbro
    He seems really chill. Plus I find his in-lore evolution method really funny.
Noivern for me !
    Fast, good movepool, great design
Aggron! :D
    He‚Äôs a big guy! Plus his movepool is surprisingly deep.
    Aggron is my favorite, too! He‚Äôs friend shaped! :-)
Mimikyu
    Amazing concept with even a better execution.
    Not OP, but we all adore Mimikyu in this house.
    Neat concept
    Better than pikachu
Wooper
    He woops. Nuff said.
        Plus who doesn't love axolotls
            That too, that too
Porygon.

Just original Porygon.

Got a big tattoo of 'em on me
    He is punished for a crime he did not commit. 

#JusticeForPorygon
        The official Pokemon Twitter even posted at one point "Porygon did nothing wrong"
    I went through a phase where everything had a Pok√©mon connection. My old PC had a Porygon screensaver, my fancy laptop had a 3D PorygonZ background, and my phone had a Rotom case (long before RotomDex became a thing and made me regret it, ha).
    glad there are other porygon lovers out there.
Vaporeon

Edit: STOP REFERRING TO THE COPYPASTA! It is genuinely my favorite pokemon that I‚Äôve used in games, and I was not trying to be funny or start a comment chain referring to you know what.
    Not that.

I think it‚Äôs got a great design, I used to use a Vaporeon I named Fish-Cat
        And it can melt into water. How cool is that.
            It‚Äôs like it was designed to be the per-‚Ä¶
                I‚Äôm going to do it.

Hey guys, did you know that in terms of Pok√©mon NU team building, Vaporeon is the most compatible bulky water for most teams? Not only does it possess the water typing, which grants it four resistances and only two weaknesses, Vaporeon has a bulk of 130/65/95, this means it is the perfect bulk to be able to check threats such as Blastoise, Talonflame, and Salazzle, and with access to utility moves like Toxic, Heal Bell, and Wish, you can support the rest of your team at the same time. Due to its combination of bulk and access to the moves Wish and Protect, there is no doubt in my mind that a properly built Vaporeon could easily stay in the field for hours without getting knocked out. They can also learn the moves Flip Turn, Scald, Haze, Substitute, and Yawn, along with not having to worry about switching into a super effective hit most of the time, so it would be incredibly easy for one to get in and get out after doing its job. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they have a variety of ways to heal off any fatigue from direct damage or status conditions. No other bulky water comes close to this level of versatility. Also, fun fact, if you invest in its 110 special attack, you can make good use of moves like Hydro Pump and Ice Beam. Vaporeon is literally built for utility in the NU tier. Ungodly defenses+high HP pool+recovery means it can provide support all day, gain momentum by pivoting out, and still come back for more.

What do you mean that‚Äôs not the copypasta?
                    It‚Äôs not THAT copypasta, but reason being it‚Äôs 10 000x better.
                No. No. NO!
                No, continue
                    perfect for hunting aquatic pok√©mon unseen, of course.
    Yes
    Did you know
        [deleted]
            My eyes become large
                And the light that you shine can't be seen
                    Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey.
    Hey, did you know that..
Mismagius
    Top tier design, great ghost type
    I wish Mismagius were larger
        The alphas in legends arceus were pretty massive
Piplup ‚ù§Ô∏è
    Cute lil penguin
        What about my favorite, Empoleon? :3
            Big penguin. Awesome typing, cool design.
Pumpkaboo
    He‚Äôs just a lil pumpkin guy how can you dislike him!
        Real!! I love my Pumpkaboo WitchHazel and their little family
    He smells nice
Gallade
    Great design, great typing
Cubone
    Cubone gang reporting in
    I have a cubone tattoo!
        Same!
            Double same!
    Feel bad for him. Saddest backstory.
    Such a sad boi cant help but love him
    Hey, not everyone can pull off wearing your ancestors skull like that!
    I don't really like funko pops, but I recently saw that there is one of cubone and it looks surprisingly good. It's a great lil fella
Typhlosion
    He looks like a volcano about to erupt!
    Best Gen 2 Pok√©mon lol
Bulbasaur
    #001 for a reason!
        Crazy that it'll soon be 0001, making it ten times cooler.
    Best answer.
    #1 in the Dex, #1 in our hearts.
    They were frickin' adorable in Detective Pikachu!
Whiscash!! I have a tattoo of the lil guy
    Water/Ground is a great type! Good catfish.
Drampa üòô
    If I was a kid getting bullied, I would want a Drampa on my team
Alolan Ninetails!
    Best dragonslayer
Victini
    Can‚Äôt lose with Victini on your team, right?
        Yeah, victory pok√©mon, it says right there
Aegislash :)
    Was absolutely busted for a while, also great design
Crobat
    It evolves because it loves you, makes me love it so so much because i always get super attached to my crobat
        This
Leafeon
    FINALLY MY FAVORITE EEVEELUTION! I love grass types and Leaf Blade is one of my favorite moves
    my favourite as well!! gotta love the chill little guy!
    Best cuddly plant-cat-thing in all worlds
Dragonair
    It has an elegance to it that it looses on evolution. Plus the pink shiny is elite!
Mawile!
    He‚Äôs got a great design and I love his mega
        I know! I really wish the mega could've just been a new evo for Mawile so I could actually use it in the new games :')
    Mawile gang!!
    My lil chompy hair bb
Jolteon
    Fast and hits like a truck
Snorlax
    He‚Äôs so tanky! I have always wanted to hug a Snorlax.
        This
Eevee
    All the evolutions
Not sure if anybody has said it yet, but Houndoom!
    I use it on every Platinum run. Also has an amazing mega
    Houndoom is an absolute badass and a great choice for dark type. Probably my second favorite! I think if I could have a pokemon irl (excluding legendaries) it‚Äôd be hard not to pick Houndoom since he‚Äôs a cool dog boy
Haunter
    Amazing design, I love his detached hands
        My favorite part as well!
    Haunter is the superior evolution form over gengar. 

Change my mind.
        I mean obviously everyone loves gengar and I do too, but come on! Haunter had the awesome disembodied hands and he‚Äôs like a playful puppy he just wants to lick everyone
            Team Haunter 100%
Dunsparce
    I love how he‚Äôs become a meme
Buizel
    Amazing design, love his lil neck floatie
        You came through on that, wish you luck in the rest of your comments.
Chandelure
    Fire/Ghost is a great type
    Best pokemon hands down
    The best Pok√©non that's an inanimate object
Flygon!!
    My #1 favorite dragon type. Great design, but I wish his stats were slightly better.
Heracross
    BIG! BLUE! BUG!
    Me too I try to catch him in whatever game he‚Äôs available
        I remember spending sooo much time headbutting trees in the original Gold version for him and Pineco üò≠üò≠üò≠
Galvantula
    Compound Eyes + Thunder
        Yikes. Add STAB on top and you‚Äôve got an amazing sweeper.
    The cute little spider grew up to be a Big Friend, fluffy and cute as ever
Togepi.
    It took me scrolling alllllllll the way to the bottom just to find Togepi?!?! This is outrageous!
    Good egg
        This
Spheal
    He round. Round good.
        I was so sad what mine evolved. Little guy made me smile every time he was on screen.
    Friend-shaped!
Skuntank
    I never knew what an actual tank that skunk was till I used one for the first time in SwSh. Armed with Toxic, Venoshock, Flamethrower, and Night Slash, and equipped with Black Sludge‚Ä¶ she took out almost everything that was thrown at her!
        This
I just love Haxorus, coolest dragon ever and also kinda the reason why I love dragon types
    He‚Äôs got an axe for a face! Plus dragon dance almost ensures he‚Äôs sweeping
Pachirisu
    It‚Äôs a world champion.
    Lil squirrel friend
    Absolutely adorable! I love Pachirisu!
        Same‚Äîmy favorite Pok√©mon!
            So happy to finally see some pachirisu lovin üíïüíï
Shuckle
    He‚Äôs just a derpy lil guy!
    Don't fuckle with shuckle

Mightyena
    I like the design, and he‚Äôs available so early in Hoenn runs you basically have to pick one up
Weavile
    Fast glass cannon. Really fun to use, had one on my LA team
        For me, Sw/Sh and PLA. Quick, and readily does tons of damage, despite a 4x weakness to fighting.
            I always teach it psycho cut as an uno reverse card
Gliscor
    Typing, swords dance, poison heal. My second favorite Pok√©mon
    God that little bat has been my favorite for such a long time.
Skarmory
    Absolute tank of a mon
    Name sounds like ska armory (i know it originates from sky armory but honestly who doesnt like a littke music reference) deserves a counterpart because it loos so cool
Scolipede
    Speed boost
Flareon!
    It is probably the most huggable Pok√©mon
Beautifly or Sylveon. Both are great.
    Beautifly is a very good design.

Sylveon is an awesome Pok√©mon in battle and is the trans rights Pok√©mon, which is very cool.
    Sylveon is top tier
Sneasel has been my guy since Gen 2!!!
    Good choice, it oozes personality
Delphox
    The mage idea is reasonably well executed here! Also it breaks the cycle of fire/fighting
    Ayyyyy another Delphox enjoyer üòé
My Favorite Pok√©mon of all time hands down Wartortle
    I like his tail, wish it stuck around for Blastoise
    Is wartortle the best mid stage starter evolution? Torrcat  and grovyle also exist so it's hard to say but top 3 for sure.
        Grovyle is my favorite, but Wartortle is in my opinion, by far the best middle stage starter evo. It's just perfect! It could be a Pok√©mon on its own, the first stage, the final evo (of a non starter)..
Malamar
    Contrary superpower is busted! Love the funny squid dude.
        This is the way brother.
Ducklet
    Love the ugly duckling inspiration
[removed]
    It has a‚Ä¶ very dedicated‚Ä¶ fanbase

But seriously tho she‚Äôs just a really cool mon and doesn‚Äôt deserve the sort of attention she gets
        Thank you ü•π
Myself
    Badass design
        Nah, you are the one with a badass design <3
Torterra! And its whole line tbh
    It‚Äôs a big ol tortoise! I wanna take a nap under his tree.
        Bro same, it looks so peaceful up there
I like Tropius, he was my first hm slave in sapphire and he seems like a fun pokemon to just hang out with if you werent a trainer/battler
Azumarill
    Huge Power
Lapras
    Best ride Pok√©mon, absolutely carried my latest Firered playthrough
Escavalier
    Really interesting design, creative evolution concept
Liligant
    Really neat grass type. Quiver Dance
Therian Landorus or as my daughter calls him Cloudorus
    Annihilates competitive
Noivern
    Big dragon friend
Caterpie
    It‚Äôs just a lil bug dude! Plus I saw a real life caterpillar that looked just like caterpie and that was neat
Serperior
    Contrary Leaf Storm
Dewgong!
    I like that it‚Äôs an ice type in a region that‚Äôs severely lacking the type
Mewtwo
    OG legendary holds up. Great backstory
Minior!
    I think he‚Äôs one of the most creative designs there is
    I love the colors! I try and catch them in different colors and name them all after space-related words.
Zorua!
I always try to catch a female one and name it "Fifi"!

Got a life sized plush too!
Favourite currently released Pok√©mon, probably my obstagoon named murcury. It has lore. Or at least mine does. In the elite 4 it was still a linoon, with an eveolite, and it was one of the 2 Pok√©mon I brought to the isle of armour. My head cannon was that it wanted to get stronger after losing in the league. During the rematch it kinda sweets.
    Your Obstagoon is my hero
Absol
    He‚Äôs just trying to help and we‚Äôre so mean to him for it!
Swampert!!!
    Awesome type, awesome design. Hoenn starters did not miss
Poliwrath!
    I love the big Fightin‚Äô Froggo!
Granbull :( I miss my favorite being in games.
    My fav is snubbull so I feel your pain
    I too miss your favorite being in games
Giratina origin forme
    Pok√©mon devil is a great concept, love the distortion world
Sableye
    Funny lil goblin guy
Finneon
    The fish is good. I feel bad for him getting put on all the forgotten Pok√©mon lists
        No he's pretty forgettable it makes sense. Only reason I live it is because there's this one scene early on the rise of darkrai movie that i watched do many times as a kid where they appear when the Pok√©mon are playing in the garden and it's one of my favourite scenes
Honestly, I know it's new, but **Basculegion**. I've been playing since RBY, so I've had a chance to "connect" with every gen's Pok√©mon, but the ghost fishy just hits different for me. Game Freak has just been nailing monster designs lately, including the SV ones.
    Yeah he‚Äôs amazing, love his lore too
    Basculegion's already in my top 10 favorites as well. Amazing design, one of the best backstories, and it's the perfect redemption to Basculin, which they admitted to having created just to add more fish to Unova. I love it!
Surskit
    One of those Pok√©mon I‚Äôve always wanted to use but never got the chance
Tyrantrum
    I love dinosaurs, and Tyrantrum is basically just a T-Rex
Bisharp :) >!plz no info on leaks!<
    I love the chess inspiration in his line!
Ditto. It‚Äôs my duuude
    It‚Äôs got a really cool gimmick
Empoleon
Arcanine
Grimmsnarl
Metagross or Aegislash
    Steel types that take no prisoners. Very cool.
Vileplume
    Well, it's my favorite too at least :) had to open up all the comments to see if someone said it.
    Great flower mon, I think it‚Äôs underrated
Bulbasaur
    #1 in the dex, #1 in our hearts
Incineroar
    I think it‚Äôs cool how they incorporate being a ‚Äúheel‚Äù wrestler into his design
Dracovish
    I think the concept behind it is neat
Jigglypuff
    Jigglypuff was hilarious in the anime
My favorite one is Audino :D
    I love killing them in BWB2W2. Not that I don‚Äôt like them, they‚Äôre just an easy source of Exp
Trevenant
Crobat
    He‚Äôs fast and hits hard!
Alakazam
    It‚Äôs a terrifying psychic type! Hits like a truck.
Somebody already said Rowlet so I‚Äôll go withhhh Oshawott!
    Funny lil otter dude
    Wotter
    I HAD TO SCROLL FOR SO LONG TO FIND THIS
Pikachu
    I mean, he‚Äôs the mascot of the franchise how can you not like him
Ludicolo
    I love how goofy he is!
Altaria! üê¶
    Love that funky cloud birb
Both Litwick amd Golurk (sorry but these two have the number 1 spot, i like them equally)
    Gen 5 did not miss with ghosts
Haxorus
Primeape. I'll tell you my favorite thing about it. It's strong and fluffy.
    You hit the nail on the head. I also used one in a Nuzlocke once and her hyper beam was my favorite way to finish opponents off
Electivire
Celebi
Excadril
Silvally
    Badass design, cool lore
    I like how teaching it to trust you is baked into its evolution
I love that everyone has a different favorite!!! It‚Äôs super fun reading these, great idea OP. See you all in paldea friday!!!
Chatot ¬∞v¬∞
Dragalge  


Also just gotta say your dedication to responding to as many people as possible is actually amazing
    Great type, great design. Really cool Pok√©mon overall.

Help my hand might fall off!
Farfetch'd (the OG Kanto one, not Galar. Galar's cool, too, but Kanto has been my man since '96).
Banette
    Very cool design inspiration
Charizard
    Mega Zard Y was my mega way back when
My favorite Pokemon is Braviary, and I‚Äôd like to tell you why:

Braviary is the embodiment a strong, noble bird, exuding a level of power and loyalty‚Äîdiligence and pride‚Äîthat not even a legendary could match. A Pokemon whose splendor inspires awe as it soars across the distant skies, similar to Ho-Oh at the start of Ash‚Äôs journey, though a likelier sight for a wider range of people and no less captivating.

From a gameplay perspective, it serves as the perfect reward for sticking with your Rufflet all the way to Lv. 52, and its solid stat spread, ability options, and move pool make it a great choice for any team.

But ultimately, my fondness for Braviary comes from a place of personal experience: my first Gen 7 playthrough, in which I used a Braviary named ‚ÄúTrooper‚Äù.

Upon finding out that I had access to a Pokemon I missed out on during my Gen 5 days (I had Black version, which gave me Mandibuzz instead) I decided I would keep a Rufflet on my team for a while to see if I could eventually get it to Lv. 52. I wasn‚Äôt particularly serious about it, since I wasn‚Äôt sure how the level scaling worked in Gen 7 yet, and I initially wanted to prioritize Pokemon new to the series. However, this Rufflet was the ‚ÄúAlola-nation manifestation of aviation determination‚Äù. Basically, he was made of pure grit. I‚Äôm serious, this little guy NEVER fainted immediately. It would always hold on with 1 HP, even against attacks that should OHKO it, and then hold on again multiple times after that, usually not taking any damage at all.

Needless to say, he was far more useful than I could have ever anticipated. I found myself winning many battles without letting any of my team members faint, simply because they never got the chance. Through ‚ÄúSheer Force‚Äù of will (pun intended) my Rufflet held fast against certain demise countless times, to the point where I would audibly say ‚Äúwow, that little guy is a trooper!‚Äù at the end of each battle he won, eventually giving him ‚ÄúTrooper‚Äù as a nickname. That nickname is a special one to me, since it wasn‚Äôt one of the nicknames I came up with after conscious thought on how to be clever with my naming schemes. Rather, it just came naturally, as if it was meant to be.

I also decided that this Trooper needed a promotion (pun intended, again), so I intentionally kept him on my team all the way until Lv. 52, at which point I taught him Superpower and smiled with pride as my opponent‚Äôs last shreds of hope flew the coop (pun intended, obviously).

He crowning achievement came in the form of singlehandedly (singlewingedly?) winning the Elite Four battle against Olivia, despite the massive type disadvantage and lowered stats from Superpower (he didn‚Äôt have Defiant, unfortunately). He took countless devastating hits, but he still didn‚Äôt give up, even when Probopass‚Äô Sturdy kept him from mowing down Olivia‚Äôs team. I had initially planned to use my other bird, Decidueye, to beat her with grass-type moves, but there was never any need. I‚Äôve can‚Äôt remember ever being more impressed with one of my own Pokemon than in that single moment, having witnessed his unflinching perseverance in the face of consecutive Rock Slides (pun VERY intended). 

Ever since, Trooper and Braviary as a whole have held a special place in my heart. I shall honor him until the end of my days, having named my Hisuian Braviary ‚ÄúTrooper Jr.‚Äù to carry on his legacy, in the hopes that his dedication and virtue shall be remembered for years to come. Trooper, you will forever be the brightest light of my fondest Pokemon memories.

What do you say to that?
    Trooper is now also my favorite Braviary.

Love both forms.

USA! USA! USA!
Gengar
    Already answered - he‚Äôs a big cool ghostie
Mamoswine
    I think it‚Äôs awesome how he‚Äôs a huge mammoth. Love mammoths
Magikarp
    I love the derpiest of all fish
Darumaka
    He‚Äôs a neat lil round dude
Lugia!
    The best legendary imo. The movie is so nostalgic for me
Vileplume
Goodra!
    My favorite pseudo legendary! Love that gooey guy.
My baby Espurr !
Blaziken

Without a doubt the worst (stat wise) of the gen 3 starters she imo looks the best. Also blaziken loves lemonade
I went through every comment and nobody said my precious boy Druddigon so I will pay them respect
Trubbish
    Silly trash boi
Genesect
    Super interesting concept. Is he a Kabutops or no?
Wigglytuff
    He‚Äôs such a silly looking mon, gotta love the Kanto pink mons
Shedinja!
Sawsbuck is my third favorite. Typhlosion and Gyarados are 1st and second but they are pretty common I think so I would rather see the less popular pick opinion
    The antlers changing based on season is really cool
Glaceon
Leavanny!
Glaceon!
    All the eeveelutions are cool, Glaceon is literally the coolest
Walrein
Espeon.
Slowpoke
Oh no what have I done lmao

It's self-sustaining now

&#x200B;

umm Carnivine
Beedrill! :D
    Great design, even better Mega evolution
Golisopod
    Great design, cool ability, and Guzma is hilarious
Lurantis!
    It‚Äôs got a great design, solar blade is a cool move
Bulbasaur!
Delfox
Parasect
    I love that it‚Äôs basically a zombie Pok√©mon
Sunflora
    I think it‚Äôs an underrated mon
PINSIR ü™≤
Meowth! That's right.
Dodrio, little ostrich boy
Plusle!
Furfrou.
I cycle through some favorites depending on my mood. Today I'm very cold and need a fire type and hot cocoa, so my favorite is Ninetales.
No one has said the true greatest Pok√©mon yet

Greninja! üê∏
It has such a regal presence! It exudes badass energy without having to look tough or intimidating.
    Totally agree, üòÅ my favourite too.
I love ninetales, just nice design and how it has 9 tails which is its name
always felt like a "pseudo-legendary" kinda like Arcanine
Hell yeah, I love how in pokemon dungeon, Ninetales turned people into pokemon!
My absolute favorite pokemon..so sad that it won't be in the next game (I think). I always try to get a shiny and despite arguments from the people I play with, I like to have a Ninetales with me at all times in my party. üß°‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•
It‚Äôs got a great design! Plus I gotta feel bad for him getting overshadowed by his pre evolution
    I absolutely love Raichu's design, I'm much more into Raichu than Pikachu.
    I‚Äôm so happy to see Raichu near the top!
    And Alolan raichu. He is just s little guy. He is awsome with his little surfboard tail
    Same. I prefer raichu, and don‚Äôt know why pikachu is the favorite.
        Have you heard of the TV show?
Goh‚Äôs Raichu is so sweet. One of the best Pok√©mon characters that I can remember.
    I love Alolan Raichu so much! They‚Äôre so cute with their surfboard tails!
Great coverage for example with grass knot and sneaky fast.  Also cuter than 'chu in my opinion
    Ahh the one who shall not be named
Man I love Raichu. Sucks Pikachu stole the show.
    Any pikachu that isn‚Äôt Ash‚Äôs is my mortal enemy
        I'm with you buddy. Ash's Pikachu is just built different.
My favorite. A perfect blend of cute and badass design.
I was typing this‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs the top comment‚Ä¶. I have this many brothers and sisters ?
Elephant good.

I always thought it was cool how it curls into a ball to attack!
    And a neat cameo in Mewtwo Strikes Back!
        I was one of those kids whose mind was absolutely blown when that movie started with a fight against a *completely unknown pokemon*.

Like a lot of kids, I knew the Pok√©dex front to back. All 150, plus three more that only the really cool kids knew about: Mew, Togepi, and Feenix (Ho-oh).

And then boom, badass rolling elephant.

Part of what made it special is how *not special* it was: it didn't have any buildup or introduction, it just belonged to some random dude. It sparked the idea that maybe there were a lot more pok√©mon, a whole world that we had never even heard of.

That our encyclopedic knowledge of every species was *nothing* compared to how much was actually out there.
            And it was the SECOND one in the movie we'd never seen before!
                It was?

I know the Vacation short had a few (Marill, Snubbull) but I don't remember any others in the Mewtwo movie.
                    Well, shit. Third, then. I forgot about Marill. I was including the Vacation short as part of the movie since it was shown directly before-hand in theaters.
                        Ah, okay. I feel like there may have been more in that one, too.

It's also possible that you didn't count Marill as *new* since it was an existing rumor (Pikablu).
            You brought me WAY back with this comment but as soon as I started reading it, I was brought back to it and Marill and being so perplexed and excited. Before the times when you could whip out a phone to search ‚Äúwhat was that spinning Pok√©mon elephant?!‚Äù
WEELEPHANT

Honestly, ground is one of my favorite types, and Donphan is very close to the top of my list even among such esteemed competition. The fact that I have such fond memories of its cameo way back in the first movie just adds to the appeal.
Big dude
Damn, you're going to be eating good in Gen 9
Tire, that explains more than enough
A man of pure taste in Pokemons
Intimidate is a great ability, and it‚Äôs cool that it doesn‚Äôt do the usual electric type thing of being fast and frail
    It‚Äôs still not the bulkiest but man I‚Äôve had a Luxray tank an earthquake from Cynthia‚Äôs Garchomp for the win more than once

Edit: after running the calcs this is nothing more than insane luck combining with my massive stupidity to make a miracle happen
        Damn, I gotta give you props just for choosing an electric type against Cynthia's Garchomp. I'm sure it learns one of the ice elemental moves but still, pretty ballsy lol
            As I‚Äôm sure you can imagine it‚Äôs never been a choice.

Every time it‚Äôs come down to Luxray and despite it having happened six times over my many many playthroughs of gen 4, I have yet to learn the lesson to give it Ice Fang as a precaution
For the longest time I thought Luxray was a Dark/Electric
    Yeah kind of a blown opportunity there, but still absolutely happy with the thunder cat.
    It is in Drayano hacks! At least in Renegade Plat. Added Dark type because it looked like a dark type (I agree)
Luxray's a Pokemon I always choose when I get the chance. It's got a great design and it has Ice Fang or Iron Tail that I can use against Cynthia's Garchomp. Love that Shinx is found so early in DPPt, too!
Big badass ghost type. The OG ghost of course he‚Äôs awesome!
    There's a reason why its the favorite Pok√©mon of the Man Who created all the Pok√©mon (Ken Sugimori)
    He is so mischievous and causes havoc. I love that Ash got one on his team.
I would like Gengar a lot more if it didn't replace Haunter.
Ranger is my favorite DnD class, and yes the enjoyment translates
    The perfect answer. Rangers rise up.
        Gotta agree here. Playing a ranger warforged atm
S Tier final starter evo. Fight me.
The Rowlet line is top tier design.
Technician is good, Breloom has a great design
    Anthropomorphic while still being distinctly creaturelike. It rides that thin line of greatness
Everytime a favorite pokemon thread comes up, I will scroll for a while looking for breloom. Thank you for making it easy
Yo i love breloom
It‚Äôs got an elite design! Plus bug/Fire is just a cool type
A person of taste, I see. Cheers to the Volcarona Supremacy!
    üç∫
He‚Äôs just tryin to help people! Poor misunderstood guy
    It's so sad. Absol shows up to try to warn people, and instead people hold him responsible for what happens.

I dunno if you have ever heard of the Moth Man urban legend from the east coast in the US. It was popularized via a movie a while back but the legend goes way back.

I feel like if the Moth Man did exist, it was trying to warn, not harm.
        Mothman is just trying to warn people of the bridge!
    Agreed.
    Absol is the mothman of pokemon
I feel represented here
Love absol! Fun fact, it‚Äôs design is based on a Japanese demon called a kutabe who warns people about impending disasters.
    Doesn‚Äôt sound like demonic behavior at all !
        The term demon has been demonized lol in most other cultures/languages it has a meaning closer to "spirit"
It‚Äôs my personal favorite Pok√©mon lol.

It‚Äôs got the coolest backstory imo
    [deleted]
        It is the remnants of a woman that got lost in a blizzard. She freezes pokemon/handsome men and brings them back to its den to add to its collection.
            [deleted]

                    Oh God are there more of these
                        You know, your username makes perfect logical sense, I just never really thought about it
Happy to see my favorite mon finally getting some attention üëÄ
    I‚Äôm happy to know I‚Äôm not the only one who loves Froslass.
I honestly wasn‚Äôt expecting the first comment to be Froslass, but I‚Äôm so happy it is. It‚Äôs my favorite Pok√©mon of all time and I can‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs not appreciated in the fandom. Let‚Äôs go Froslass gang!
MY GURL!!!! Froslass all the way!!!
I leik mudkipz.
    So I herd u leik mudkipz
My username says it all
    aw thank you :3
    So i herd u liek teh mudkipz
Literally almost perfect starter for the region its in and doesn't get the love it deserves in newer games. A alpha swampert would be terrifying in the obsidian marshlands
A pseudo legend that‚Äôs not a dragon! Also he‚Äôs got a great shiny
Took way too long to get here. I adore metagross
Sniper is a good ability. Kingdra was a great design for the second ever fully evolved dragon type
Unless my buddy really lost all my pok√©mon, I have a Kingdra named Glock that I used competitively for a while.
He‚Äôs the sireist of quags. Plus I find the concept of his Unaware ability absolutely hilarious
    I have a Yamper that I've tried to make into a good catcher because of their unique ability to reclaim lost pok√©balls (it's too frail to really serve that purpose but oh well).

I taught him Nuzzle, Bite, and Attract to immobilize things I wanted to catch.

It cracked me up way more than it should have when he tried to seduce a Wailord and she had the Unaware ability.
        I think you're thinking of the ability "Oblivious". Unaware ignores stat boosts from the opposing pokemon when hit by an attack.
            Oops, you're correct.

There's a joke here but I feel like I'm not allowed to get it.
He‚Äôs basically Pok√©mon Godzilla and Godzilla is cool
+1 for Tyrannitar
Best Pok√©mon right here
Adorable. Badass. Adorable AND badass!
He‚Äôs a big ol fat dragon. He‚Äôs so goofy but so strong
Dragonite is probably what got me into Pokemon.  As a kid, I was convinced dragons got a bad rap and would actually be sweet and friendly and derpy, kinda like wolves.  And orange was my favourite colour, so I think a fat derpy dragon being the pseudolegendary of gen 1 is the reason I have been into Pokemon for like over 20 years now.
    To me Dragonite is the golden retriever of dragons and that‚Äôs why I love them.
He‚Äôs just a lil goblin dude!
I really liked Sableye back in Ruby, but I couldn't figure out a good strategy & gave up
He‚Äôs a big doggie! I like the doggie.
Arcanine is the best ever ‚ù§Ô∏è
Technician-boosted Bullet Punch is terrifying

Also design, I love Scizor‚Äôs design.
    I agree. 60bp, STAB, AND priority? Yikes.
        Damn, that means 90bp priority attack. Never tought about it
First pokemon that I shiny-hunted! (actually came after just only 270 eggs or smth!)
Elite shiny, I like that he‚Äôs a tanky eeveelution
Same just always feels like his tm pool could get some love tho when I actually want to use them
He‚Äôs a good round owl boi
    very true
They look like an apple wearing a bowtie and I love them for it
I searched the whole thread to find another Ampharos supporter, top tier, and I'm excited to have the line back in Scarlet/Violet
    When I tell you I screamed when I saw mareep!
        Same, I'm so excited to transfer over my old boy from SoulSilver
    Ampharos is the best
    It's my favorite too! My boyfriend caught me a shiny in Shining Pearl that I'm looking forward to using in ranked battles whenever home gets updated
My favorite too!
Cool design, terrifying mega
    Dude broke the competitive game

And was rewarded with a Mega
        A mega which then broke the competitive game
He seems really chill. Plus I find his in-lore evolution method really funny.
Fast, good movepool, great design
He‚Äôs a big guy! Plus his movepool is surprisingly deep.
Aggron is my favorite, too! He‚Äôs friend shaped! :-)
Amazing concept with even a better execution.
Not OP, but we all adore Mimikyu in this house.
Neat concept
Better than pikachu
He woops. Nuff said.
    Plus who doesn't love axolotls
        That too, that too
He is punished for a crime he did not commit. 

#JusticeForPorygon
    The official Pokemon Twitter even posted at one point "Porygon did nothing wrong"
I went through a phase where everything had a Pok√©mon connection. My old PC had a Porygon screensaver, my fancy laptop had a 3D PorygonZ background, and my phone had a Rotom case (long before RotomDex became a thing and made me regret it, ha).
glad there are other porygon lovers out there.
Not that.

I think it‚Äôs got a great design, I used to use a Vaporeon I named Fish-Cat
    And it can melt into water. How cool is that.
        It‚Äôs like it was designed to be the per-‚Ä¶
            I‚Äôm going to do it.

Hey guys, did you know that in terms of Pok√©mon NU team building, Vaporeon is the most compatible bulky water for most teams? Not only does it possess the water typing, which grants it four resistances and only two weaknesses, Vaporeon has a bulk of 130/65/95, this means it is the perfect bulk to be able to check threats such as Blastoise, Talonflame, and Salazzle, and with access to utility moves like Toxic, Heal Bell, and Wish, you can support the rest of your team at the same time. Due to its combination of bulk and access to the moves Wish and Protect, there is no doubt in my mind that a properly built Vaporeon could easily stay in the field for hours without getting knocked out. They can also learn the moves Flip Turn, Scald, Haze, Substitute, and Yawn, along with not having to worry about switching into a super effective hit most of the time, so it would be incredibly easy for one to get in and get out after doing its job. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they have a variety of ways to heal off any fatigue from direct damage or status conditions. No other bulky water comes close to this level of versatility. Also, fun fact, if you invest in its 110 special attack, you can make good use of moves like Hydro Pump and Ice Beam. Vaporeon is literally built for utility in the NU tier. Ungodly defenses+high HP pool+recovery means it can provide support all day, gain momentum by pivoting out, and still come back for more.

What do you mean that‚Äôs not the copypasta?
                It‚Äôs not THAT copypasta, but reason being it‚Äôs 10 000x better.
            No. No. NO!
            No, continue
                perfect for hunting aquatic pok√©mon unseen, of course.
Yes
Did you know

        My eyes become large
            And the light that you shine can't be seen
                Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey.
Hey, did you know that..
Top tier design, great ghost type
I wish Mismagius were larger
    The alphas in legends arceus were pretty massive
Cute lil penguin
    What about my favorite, Empoleon? :3
        Big penguin. Awesome typing, cool design.
He‚Äôs just a lil pumpkin guy how can you dislike him!
    Real!! I love my Pumpkaboo WitchHazel and their little family
He smells nice
Great design, great typing
Cubone gang reporting in
I have a cubone tattoo!
    Same!
        Double same!
Feel bad for him. Saddest backstory.
Such a sad boi cant help but love him
Hey, not everyone can pull off wearing your ancestors skull like that!
I don't really like funko pops, but I recently saw that there is one of cubone and it looks surprisingly good. It's a great lil fella
He looks like a volcano about to erupt!
Best Gen 2 Pok√©mon lol
#001 for a reason!
    Crazy that it'll soon be 0001, making it ten times cooler.
Best answer.
#1 in the Dex, #1 in our hearts.
They were frickin' adorable in Detective Pikachu!
Water/Ground is a great type! Good catfish.
If I was a kid getting bullied, I would want a Drampa on my team
Best dragonslayer
Can‚Äôt lose with Victini on your team, right?
    Yeah, victory pok√©mon, it says right there
Was absolutely busted for a while, also great design
It evolves because it loves you, makes me love it so so much because i always get super attached to my crobat
    This
FINALLY MY FAVORITE EEVEELUTION! I love grass types and Leaf Blade is one of my favorite moves
my favourite as well!! gotta love the chill little guy!
Best cuddly plant-cat-thing in all worlds
It has an elegance to it that it looses on evolution. Plus the pink shiny is elite!
He‚Äôs got a great design and I love his mega
    I know! I really wish the mega could've just been a new evo for Mawile so I could actually use it in the new games :')
Mawile gang!!
My lil chompy hair bb
Fast and hits like a truck
He‚Äôs so tanky! I have always wanted to hug a Snorlax.
    This
All the evolutions
I use it on every Platinum run. Also has an amazing mega
Houndoom is an absolute badass and a great choice for dark type. Probably my second favorite! I think if I could have a pokemon irl (excluding legendaries) it‚Äôd be hard not to pick Houndoom since he‚Äôs a cool dog boy
Amazing design, I love his detached hands
    My favorite part as well!
Haunter is the superior evolution form over gengar. 

Change my mind.
    I mean obviously everyone loves gengar and I do too, but come on! Haunter had the awesome disembodied hands and he‚Äôs like a playful puppy he just wants to lick everyone
        Team Haunter 100%
I love how he‚Äôs become a meme
Amazing design, love his lil neck floatie
    You came through on that, wish you luck in the rest of your comments.
Fire/Ghost is a great type
Best pokemon hands down
The best Pok√©non that's an inanimate object
My #1 favorite dragon type. Great design, but I wish his stats were slightly better.
BIG! BLUE! BUG!
Me too I try to catch him in whatever game he‚Äôs available
    I remember spending sooo much time headbutting trees in the original Gold version for him and Pineco üò≠üò≠üò≠
Compound Eyes + Thunder
    Yikes. Add STAB on top and you‚Äôve got an amazing sweeper.
The cute little spider grew up to be a Big Friend, fluffy and cute as ever
It took me scrolling alllllllll the way to the bottom just to find Togepi?!?! This is outrageous!
Good egg
    This
He round. Round good.
    I was so sad what mine evolved. Little guy made me smile every time he was on screen.
Friend-shaped!
I never knew what an actual tank that skunk was till I used one for the first time in SwSh. Armed with Toxic, Venoshock, Flamethrower, and Night Slash, and equipped with Black Sludge‚Ä¶ she took out almost everything that was thrown at her!
    This
He‚Äôs got an axe for a face! Plus dragon dance almost ensures he‚Äôs sweeping
It‚Äôs a world champion.
Lil squirrel friend
Absolutely adorable! I love Pachirisu!
    Same‚Äîmy favorite Pok√©mon!
        So happy to finally see some pachirisu lovin üíïüíï
He‚Äôs just a derpy lil guy!

I like the design, and he‚Äôs available so early in Hoenn runs you basically have to pick one up
Fast glass cannon. Really fun to use, had one on my LA team
    For me, Sw/Sh and PLA. Quick, and readily does tons of damage, despite a 4x weakness to fighting.
        I always teach it psycho cut as an uno reverse card
Typing, swords dance, poison heal. My second favorite Pok√©mon
God that little bat has been my favorite for such a long time.
Absolute tank of a mon
Name sounds like ska armory (i know it originates from sky armory but honestly who doesnt like a littke music reference) deserves a counterpart because it loos so cool
Speed boost
It is probably the most huggable Pok√©mon
Beautifly is a very good design.

Sylveon is an awesome Pok√©mon in battle and is the trans rights Pok√©mon, which is very cool.
Sylveon is top tier
Good choice, it oozes personality
The mage idea is reasonably well executed here! Also it breaks the cycle of fire/fighting
Ayyyyy another Delphox enjoyer üòé
I like his tail, wish it stuck around for Blastoise
Is wartortle the best mid stage starter evolution? Torrcat  and grovyle also exist so it's hard to say but top 3 for sure.
    Grovyle is my favorite, but Wartortle is in my opinion, by far the best middle stage starter evo. It's just perfect! It could be a Pok√©mon on its own, the first stage, the final evo (of a non starter)..
Contrary superpower is busted! Love the funny squid dude.
    This is the way brother.
Love the ugly duckling inspiration
It has a‚Ä¶ very dedicated‚Ä¶ fanbase

But seriously tho she‚Äôs just a really cool mon and doesn‚Äôt deserve the sort of attention she gets
    Thank you ü•π
Badass design
    Nah, you are the one with a badass design <3
It‚Äôs a big ol tortoise! I wanna take a nap under his tree.
    Bro same, it looks so peaceful up there
Huge Power
Best ride Pok√©mon, absolutely carried my latest Firered playthrough
Really interesting design, creative evolution concept
Really neat grass type. Quiver Dance
Annihilates competitive
Big dragon friend
It‚Äôs just a lil bug dude! Plus I saw a real life caterpillar that looked just like caterpie and that was neat
Contrary Leaf Storm
I like that it‚Äôs an ice type in a region that‚Äôs severely lacking the type
OG legendary holds up. Great backstory
I think he‚Äôs one of the most creative designs there is
I love the colors! I try and catch them in different colors and name them all after space-related words.
Your Obstagoon is my hero
He‚Äôs just trying to help and we‚Äôre so mean to him for it!
Awesome type, awesome design. Hoenn starters did not miss
I love the big Fightin‚Äô Froggo!
My fav is snubbull so I feel your pain
I too miss your favorite being in games
Pok√©mon devil is a great concept, love the distortion world
Funny lil goblin guy
The fish is good. I feel bad for him getting put on all the forgotten Pok√©mon lists
    No he's pretty forgettable it makes sense. Only reason I live it is because there's this one scene early on the rise of darkrai movie that i watched do many times as a kid where they appear when the Pok√©mon are playing in the garden and it's one of my favourite scenes
Yeah he‚Äôs amazing, love his lore too
Basculegion's already in my top 10 favorites as well. Amazing design, one of the best backstories, and it's the perfect redemption to Basculin, which they admitted to having created just to add more fish to Unova. I love it!
One of those Pok√©mon I‚Äôve always wanted to use but never got the chance
I love dinosaurs, and Tyrantrum is basically just a T-Rex
I love the chess inspiration in his line!
It‚Äôs got a really cool gimmick
Steel types that take no prisoners. Very cool.
Well, it's my favorite too at least :) had to open up all the comments to see if someone said it.
Great flower mon, I think it‚Äôs underrated
#1 in the dex, #1 in our hearts
I think it‚Äôs cool how they incorporate being a ‚Äúheel‚Äù wrestler into his design
I think the concept behind it is neat
Jigglypuff was hilarious in the anime
I love killing them in BWB2W2. Not that I don‚Äôt like them, they‚Äôre just an easy source of Exp
He‚Äôs fast and hits hard!
It‚Äôs a terrifying psychic type! Hits like a truck.
Funny lil otter dude
Wotter
I HAD TO SCROLL FOR SO LONG TO FIND THIS
I mean, he‚Äôs the mascot of the franchise how can you not like him
I love how goofy he is!
Love that funky cloud birb
Gen 5 did not miss with ghosts
You hit the nail on the head. I also used one in a Nuzlocke once and her hyper beam was my favorite way to finish opponents off
Badass design, cool lore
I like how teaching it to trust you is baked into its evolution
Great type, great design. Really cool Pok√©mon overall.

Help my hand might fall off!
Very cool design inspiration
Mega Zard Y was my mega way back when
Trooper is now also my favorite Braviary.

Love both forms.

USA! USA! USA!
Already answered - he‚Äôs a big cool ghostie
I think it‚Äôs awesome how he‚Äôs a huge mammoth. Love mammoths
I love the derpiest of all fish
He‚Äôs a neat lil round dude
The best legendary imo. The movie is so nostalgic for me
My favorite pseudo legendary! Love that gooey guy.
Silly trash boi
Super interesting concept. Is he a Kabutops or no?
He‚Äôs such a silly looking mon, gotta love the Kanto pink mons
The antlers changing based on season is really cool
All the eeveelutions are cool, Glaceon is literally the coolest
Great design, even better Mega evolution
Great design, cool ability, and Guzma is hilarious
It‚Äôs got a great design, solar blade is a cool move
I love that it‚Äôs basically a zombie Pok√©mon
I think it‚Äôs an underrated mon
Totally agree, üòÅ my favourite too.
I absolutely love Raichu's design, I'm much more into Raichu than Pikachu.
I‚Äôm so happy to see Raichu near the top!
And Alolan raichu. He is just s little guy. He is awsome with his little surfboard tail
Same. I prefer raichu, and don‚Äôt know why pikachu is the favorite.
    Have you heard of the TV show?
I love Alolan Raichu so much! They‚Äôre so cute with their surfboard tails!
Ahh the one who shall not be named
Any pikachu that isn‚Äôt Ash‚Äôs is my mortal enemy
    I'm with you buddy. Ash's Pikachu is just built different.
And a neat cameo in Mewtwo Strikes Back!
    I was one of those kids whose mind was absolutely blown when that movie started with a fight against a *completely unknown pokemon*.

Like a lot of kids, I knew the Pok√©dex front to back. All 150, plus three more that only the really cool kids knew about: Mew, Togepi, and Feenix (Ho-oh).

And then boom, badass rolling elephant.

Part of what made it special is how *not special* it was: it didn't have any buildup or introduction, it just belonged to some random dude. It sparked the idea that maybe there were a lot more pok√©mon, a whole world that we had never even heard of.

That our encyclopedic knowledge of every species was *nothing* compared to how much was actually out there.
        And it was the SECOND one in the movie we'd never seen before!
            It was?

I know the Vacation short had a few (Marill, Snubbull) but I don't remember any others in the Mewtwo movie.
                Well, shit. Third, then. I forgot about Marill. I was including the Vacation short as part of the movie since it was shown directly before-hand in theaters.
                    Ah, okay. I feel like there may have been more in that one, too.

It's also possible that you didn't count Marill as *new* since it was an existing rumor (Pikablu).
        You brought me WAY back with this comment but as soon as I started reading it, I was brought back to it and Marill and being so perplexed and excited. Before the times when you could whip out a phone to search ‚Äúwhat was that spinning Pok√©mon elephant?!‚Äù
It‚Äôs still not the bulkiest but man I‚Äôve had a Luxray tank an earthquake from Cynthia‚Äôs Garchomp for the win more than once

Edit: after running the calcs this is nothing more than insane luck combining with my massive stupidity to make a miracle happen
    Damn, I gotta give you props just for choosing an electric type against Cynthia's Garchomp. I'm sure it learns one of the ice elemental moves but still, pretty ballsy lol
        As I‚Äôm sure you can imagine it‚Äôs never been a choice.

Every time it‚Äôs come down to Luxray and despite it having happened six times over my many many playthroughs of gen 4, I have yet to learn the lesson to give it Ice Fang as a precaution
Yeah kind of a blown opportunity there, but still absolutely happy with the thunder cat.
It is in Drayano hacks! At least in Renegade Plat. Added Dark type because it looked like a dark type (I agree)
There's a reason why its the favorite Pok√©mon of the Man Who created all the Pok√©mon (Ken Sugimori)
He is so mischievous and causes havoc. I love that Ash got one on his team.
The perfect answer. Rangers rise up.
    Gotta agree here. Playing a ranger warforged atm
Anthropomorphic while still being distinctly creaturelike. It rides that thin line of greatness
üç∫
It's so sad. Absol shows up to try to warn people, and instead people hold him responsible for what happens.

I dunno if you have ever heard of the Moth Man urban legend from the east coast in the US. It was popularized via a movie a while back but the legend goes way back.

I feel like if the Moth Man did exist, it was trying to warn, not harm.
    Mothman is just trying to warn people of the bridge!
Agreed.
Absol is the mothman of pokemon
Doesn‚Äôt sound like demonic behavior at all !
    The term demon has been demonized lol in most other cultures/languages it has a meaning closer to "spirit"

    It is the remnants of a woman that got lost in a blizzard. She freezes pokemon/handsome men and brings them back to its den to add to its collection.

I have a Yamper that I've tried to make into a good catcher because of their unique ability to reclaim lost pok√©balls (it's too frail to really serve that purpose but oh well).

I taught him Nuzzle, Bite, and Attract to immobilize things I wanted to catch.

It cracked me up way more than it should have when he tried to seduce a Wailord and she had the Unaware ability.
    I think you're thinking of the ability "Oblivious". Unaware ignores stat boosts from the opposing pokemon when hit by an attack.
        Oops, you're correct.

There's a joke here but I feel like I'm not allowed to get it.
To me Dragonite is the golden retriever of dragons and that‚Äôs why I love them.
I agree. 60bp, STAB, AND priority? Yikes.
    Damn, that means 90bp priority attack. Never tought about it
very true
When I tell you I screamed when I saw mareep!
    Same, I'm so excited to transfer over my old boy from SoulSilver
Ampharos is the best
It's my favorite too! My boyfriend caught me a shiny in Shining Pearl that I'm looking forward to using in ranked battles whenever home gets updated
Dude broke the competitive game

And was rewarded with a Mega
    A mega which then broke the competitive game
Plus who doesn't love axolotls
    That too, that too
The official Pokemon Twitter even posted at one point "Porygon did nothing wrong"
And it can melt into water. How cool is that.
    It‚Äôs like it was designed to be the per-‚Ä¶
        I‚Äôm going to do it.

Hey guys, did you know that in terms of Pok√©mon NU team building, Vaporeon is the most compatible bulky water for most teams? Not only does it possess the water typing, which grants it four resistances and only two weaknesses, Vaporeon has a bulk of 130/65/95, this means it is the perfect bulk to be able to check threats such as Blastoise, Talonflame, and Salazzle, and with access to utility moves like Toxic, Heal Bell, and Wish, you can support the rest of your team at the same time. Due to its combination of bulk and access to the moves Wish and Protect, there is no doubt in my mind that a properly built Vaporeon could easily stay in the field for hours without getting knocked out. They can also learn the moves Flip Turn, Scald, Haze, Substitute, and Yawn, along with not having to worry about switching into a super effective hit most of the time, so it would be incredibly easy for one to get in and get out after doing its job. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they have a variety of ways to heal off any fatigue from direct damage or status conditions. No other bulky water comes close to this level of versatility. Also, fun fact, if you invest in its 110 special attack, you can make good use of moves like Hydro Pump and Ice Beam. Vaporeon is literally built for utility in the NU tier. Ungodly defenses+high HP pool+recovery means it can provide support all day, gain momentum by pivoting out, and still come back for more.

What do you mean that‚Äôs not the copypasta?
            It‚Äôs not THAT copypasta, but reason being it‚Äôs 10 000x better.
        No. No. NO!
        No, continue

For me, Sw/Sh and PLA. Quick, and readily does tons of damage, despite a 4x weakness to fighting.
    I always teach it psycho cut as an uno reverse card
Grovyle is my favorite, but Wartortle is in my opinion, by far the best middle stage starter evo. It's just perfect! It could be a Pok√©mon on its own, the first stage, the final evo (of a non starter)..
This is the way brother.
Thank you ü•π
Nah, you are the one with a badass design <3
Bro same, it looks so peaceful up there
No he's pretty forgettable it makes sense. Only reason I live it is because there's this one scene early on the rise of darkrai movie that i watched do many times as a kid where they appear when the Pok√©mon are playing in the garden and it's one of my favourite scenes
Have you heard of the TV show?
I'm with you buddy. Ash's Pikachu is just built different.
I was one of those kids whose mind was absolutely blown when that movie started with a fight against a *completely unknown pokemon*.

Like a lot of kids, I knew the Pok√©dex front to back. All 150, plus three more that only the really cool kids knew about: Mew, Togepi, and Feenix (Ho-oh).

And then boom, badass rolling elephant.

Part of what made it special is how *not special* it was: it didn't have any buildup or introduction, it just belonged to some random dude. It sparked the idea that maybe there were a lot more pok√©mon, a whole world that we had never even heard of.

That our encyclopedic knowledge of every species was *nothing* compared to how much was actually out there.
    And it was the SECOND one in the movie we'd never seen before!
        It was?

I know the Vacation short had a few (Marill, Snubbull) but I don't remember any others in the Mewtwo movie.
            Well, shit. Third, then. I forgot about Marill. I was including the Vacation short as part of the movie since it was shown directly before-hand in theaters.
                Ah, okay. I feel like there may have been more in that one, too.

It's also possible that you didn't count Marill as *new* since it was an existing rumor (Pikablu).
    You brought me WAY back with this comment but as soon as I started reading it, I was brought back to it and Marill and being so perplexed and excited. Before the times when you could whip out a phone to search ‚Äúwhat was that spinning Pok√©mon elephant?!‚Äù
Damn, I gotta give you props just for choosing an electric type against Cynthia's Garchomp. I'm sure it learns one of the ice elemental moves but still, pretty ballsy lol
    As I‚Äôm sure you can imagine it‚Äôs never been a choice.

Every time it‚Äôs come down to Luxray and despite it having happened six times over my many many playthroughs of gen 4, I have yet to learn the lesson to give it Ice Fang as a precaution
Gotta agree here. Playing a ranger warforged atm
Mothman is just trying to warn people of the bridge!
The term demon has been demonized lol in most other cultures/languages it has a meaning closer to "spirit"
It is the remnants of a woman that got lost in a blizzard. She freezes pokemon/handsome men and brings them back to its den to add to its collection.

            Oh God are there more of these
                You know, your username makes perfect logical sense, I just never really thought about it
I think you're thinking of the ability "Oblivious". Unaware ignores stat boosts from the opposing pokemon when hit by an attack.
    Oops, you're correct.

There's a joke here but I feel like I'm not allowed to get it.
Damn, that means 90bp priority attack. Never tought about it
Same, I'm so excited to transfer over my old boy from SoulSilver
A mega which then broke the competitive game
That too, that too
It‚Äôs like it was designed to be the per-‚Ä¶
    I‚Äôm going to do it.

Hey guys, did you know that in terms of Pok√©mon NU team building, Vaporeon is the most compatible bulky water for most teams? Not only does it possess the water typing, which grants it four resistances and only two weaknesses, Vaporeon has a bulk of 130/65/95, this means it is the perfect bulk to be able to check threats such as Blastoise, Talonflame, and Salazzle, and with access to utility moves like Toxic, Heal Bell, and Wish, you can support the rest of your team at the same time. Due to its combination of bulk and access to the moves Wish and Protect, there is no doubt in my mind that a properly built Vaporeon could easily stay in the field for hours without getting knocked out. They can also learn the moves Flip Turn, Scald, Haze, Substitute, and Yawn, along with not having to worry about switching into a super effective hit most of the time, so it would be incredibly easy for one to get in and get out after doing its job. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they have a variety of ways to heal off any fatigue from direct damage or status conditions. No other bulky water comes close to this level of versatility. Also, fun fact, if you invest in its 110 special attack, you can make good use of moves like Hydro Pump and Ice Beam. Vaporeon is literally built for utility in the NU tier. Ungodly defenses+high HP pool+recovery means it can provide support all day, gain momentum by pivoting out, and still come back for more.

What do you mean that‚Äôs not the copypasta?
        It‚Äôs not THAT copypasta, but reason being it‚Äôs 10 000x better.
    No. No. NO!
    No, continue
        perfect for hunting aquatic pok√©mon unseen, of course.
My eyes become large
    And the light that you shine can't be seen
        Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey.
Big penguin. Awesome typing, cool design.
Double same!
Team Haunter 100%
So happy to finally see some pachirisu lovin üíïüíï
