[[What would your signature Pokemon be]]


Let's say you're either a renowned trainer, gym leader, elite four member, or champion. What Pokemon would you designate as your ace or in other words, your signature Pokemon.

No Legendaries or Mythicals, It can be based on either competitive viability or your personal preference.

For those who don't follow, examples of signature Pokemon are: , Cynthia's Garchomp, Youngster Joey's Ratatta, Clay's Excadrill, etc.


Ampharos. Always loved electric pok√©mon for some reason and I adored him so much in Soul Silver I look for him in every game now.
    I've always had a soft spot for Ampharos. It's definitely one of my favorite electric types.
    When I was 9 I had an Ampharos called Pancake in my first play through of Pok√©mon Silver which was my favourite Pok√©mon ever, I basically only used Pancake for the entire run and he was at level 93 with over 500 hours played, but my cartridge (+ Gameboy Colour) was stolen when I was camping a couple of years later. I got a new copy and had Pancake II, and even though it wasn't the same it was still my favourite Pok√©mon.

I was so annoyed that they made Mareep incredibly rare on Pok√©mon Go when they released Gen 2.
        I had almost the exact same story with my Mightyena, Buddy, from Sapphire. He was named after a dog I had as a kid. I saved up my pocket money to buy the game, trained my little guy as basically the only 'mon I used, even transferred him onto my SoulSilver save when a friend in year 12 showed me you could do that. Then had my DS and all the games stolen, and I still miss Buddy.

I know they're just pixels and all, but I bet Buddy and Pancake are having fun together in their little digital afterlife.
    Funny story. I had a Flaffy and didn't know she evolved. I was totally cool with this bipedal sheep. Then she evolved. Coolest gaming moments for me ever.  I was so surprised and loved my new weird giraffe with flippers.

Edit: I get flaffy and mareep confused my bad
        You say Mareep, but you describe Flaafy. I'm confused
            Meant flaffy lol
        My only gripe with ampharos is that it doesn't keep any wool as part of it's design :(
        My first ever pokemon game was yellow, so I used Pikachu all the way through. My second game was Silver. And ampharos was my new pikachu in that game
    I hate that after two waves of DLC, we still don‚Äôt have Ampharos in SwSh.
        Didn't we see the Mareep line in one of the Scarlet/Violet trailers? If so, I'm grabbing one for my team ASAP.

Move over, Wooloo. The OG sheepy boi holds a place on my team.
            Always felt weird around the hype for Wooloo. "It's the first sheep/goat pokemon!"

Mareep and Skiddo cry in the background
    The entire Mareep line is adorable!
Nidoking. Since 98‚Äô it‚Äôs always been Nidoking.
    Found Giovanni
        Too bad Nidoking is so short though.
            Short (nido)kings deserve love, too üëë
                So in Spanish you could translate its name to King of the Nest
                    Sounds like a neat way of saying House Husband
    The Nidos deserve more love. They're Pok√©mon royalty
        When I was young and dumb and didn‚Äôt do anything like ‚Äúbuild a Pok√©mon team‚Äù, I got through most of Pok√©mon Yellow with just Pikachu and a female Nidoran that I only caught at the start so that I could have an answer to Brock.

I stopped at Giovanni because uh, Ground and Water moves, and Pikachu and Nidoqueen were the only two at any sort of viable level.
        I was absolutely shocked they didn't get regional forms in Sword and Shield, what a missed opportunity.
        Holy shit. This comment thread is my 6 mon kings comp.
    Fucking bad ass
    That IS a good one!
    Nice choice, I have a shiny Nidoking. First and only shiny. Got it from let‚Äôs go pikachu
    Shiny Nidoking that knows surf. That would be my signature pokemon at my water gym.
    Yes!!! Nidoking is a boss üëäüèª
    Had shiny Nidoking in PLG and loved him. Always been a favorite of mine.
        Pokemon Legends Geodude?
            Yeah it‚Äôs my favorite game?
    I finally found the Nidoking to my Nidoqueen.
    Also been repping Nidoking now for about a
decade. Glad I still have my Burger King figurine of him.
    Nidoqueen was always my girl for her double kick in pokemon yellow
    Dragonite. Since 98'. OG Boys.
Penguins have been my favorite animals since I was a kid, and Empoleon has always been my favorite mon as a result. So, it'd 100% be my ace. Also convenient that I love a lot of steel types, so it'd be perfect for a gym/e4 role.
    Empoleon gang represent! I'm a little bitter I can't bring mine into Sword/Shield
    Hopefully you include ol' Delibird in your team to fit the theme
        Absolutely; Delibird's a staple for me in Johto
    How do you feel about Eiscue?
        Love it! It's block head is so cute
    Why no Eiscue
        I love Eiscue and Delibird as well! Piplup was just the first penguin Pokemon I had ever seen (my first game was Sapphire, so I didn't even know Delibird was a thing), and since it was also my starter, it was almost inevitable that it'd be my favorite
Tyrannitar 

It‚Äôs been my favourite for almost 2 decades.
    Love it. Unique pseudo legendary
        We need more pseudo legendaries that aren‚Äôt dragon types. Part of why I like Metagross so much.
            I will always consider volcarona as a pseudo, i know its stats dont add to 600 but it is a powerhouse that picks up a broom and slaughters teams that arent prepared.

Also the way it's presented (static mon) in BW gives legendary vibes.
                Just got a full stats shiny Volcarona Lvl 100 through wonder trade

E: I know it‚Äôs hacked lol not daft
            Fuck even Metagross had a gross type combo.

Rock dark just made it a corner stone for any strong rock or dark team.

I want more weak types to get some strong mons.
                I'm pretty sure back then steel types resisted dark & ghost so it neutralised the weaknesses
                    Yep. You would have to come at it with Fire or Ground to get 2x
    I've had the same Tyranitar on my team since HGSS
    Me too , they did us dirty with the Mega Evolution tho
        Really? I thought it was cool.
            Yeah same with Heracross , bulkier and sharper doesnt mean better.
                Mega Heracross with multi hit moves was dope af though
    Came looking for this one. Glad it's not too far down
    Also why did Karen have Vileplume and Gengar when Tyranitar and Sneasel literally debuted that gen
As a simple, rugged man, I'd have to go for a simple, well made Pok√©mon that knows how to survive in all situations.

GO VICTREEBEL!
    Would you scream and shriek in the same manner?
        SKEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
    You are a man of culture, I see
        A man of focus, determination, and sheer fucking taste
            "I once saw him KO 3 trainers in a gym..."

"With a Bellsprout, I've heard this story."

"With a fuc-king Bellsprout! Who the fuck can do that??"
                I love this
    Victreebel has a such a great design and actually usable stats, but the movepool is so poor compared to others. It's a shame.
        It's more than capable of solo-ing any of the games tbqh
    And then Victreebel tries to eat you. You never need Potions, you‚Äôre the Potion to heal it
    Found James. Now where is Jessie and her Weezing? Also where is Meowth???!!?
I travel and fly often so Flygon with matching goggles
    Love the hatching goggles idea. Very creative üôÇ
        What is hatching from these goggles? üò±
            Trapinch
                Oh nos.
            Freshly hatched gogglings
    Thank god Flygon wasn‚Äôt too far down. My ace without hesitation.
    I think we would all travel and fly often if we could just ride dragons to work
    Flygon was betrayed by game freak, such a cool Mon but garchomp stole the limelight, and then got a mega it didn't need, further relegating flygon into obscurity.
Crobat for me
    Crobat and Scolipede are easily my favorite poison-types.
        SCOLIPEDE IS SO COOL THO??!?!
    Crobat, followed by his two BFFs and partners in crime, Toxicroak and Drapion. They make such a neat little mischievous-looking trio.
        I‚Äôve been called out, these are like my top 3 pokemon
    Underrated af
        That bat HARD carried my first gen 2 playthrough. Love it forever
My favorite little dead eyed bird cramorant
    Just a team of 6 Cramorant, probably a rain setup, all of them have some sets with like air slash, roost, defog, surf, etc.
        Cant it learn huricane?
            yes
    Cramorant gang!
    I really wanna hug a Cramorant. Its ingame model has its wings spread out; the little derp looks like it wants a hug.
        Real life [cormorants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cormorant) often spread out their wings to dry them. Unlike most birds, their feathers are not fully waterprooof. This allows more efficient diving when they hunt for fish, but that also means they have to dry their wings off in the sun when they come back up.
    Bonus points for the orange curry-colored shiny form.
Kanto Sandslash.

My first pet was a lovely ginger cat named Chester. I pretty much grew up with him since I was much younger, and sadly he passed on when I was 16. I pretty much had him for the entirety of my life at that point.

For some reason, I had always felt he looked like Sandslash. The colour was quite similar, and personality-wise he seemed to somewhat fit in with Pokedex entries. He used to run around as fast as he could when he was scared, and had sharp claws he was not afraid to use if he felt threatened (was not super friendly to strangers).

In every Pokemon game from RBY I have always made it a point to catch a Sandslash, nickname it Chester, and use it in my teams. Even in hacked ROMs, I do the same.

Nowadays, my main interaction with Pokemon comes by playing Doubles UU on Showdown. Those who play often enough are likely to have encountered someone using a Sand team with a Sandslash nicknamed Chester on it. I sometimes like to roleplay as a Hiker too.

That is me.
    I'm the exact same! I always name an Eevee Gizmo and evolve him to an Umbreon because I think they look alike. Giz was my first animal too (at age 11). He's an old man now and is dying but I find comfort I can still play with him through all my old games.
        Umbreon here, too.
    That is wholesome.  I'd give an award if I could for it.
        I gotchu homie.
        Got you, fam.
    Naming my next sandslash in a nuzlocke Chester
        Better honor that responsibility friend - keep the flame alive!
Metagross for sure. With my shiny Corviknight as a runner up.
    Oh yah, Metagross is mine. 

I'd do an all metal gym. Metagross. Lucario if that's ok. Steelix, empoleon bastiodon magneton. 

Steel gym leader would be my shiiiiiiittttt
        Would you stick with the Magneton or go Magnezone?
            Magnezone with zap cannon was sooo cool in the games. I didn‚Äôt care that it rarely hit, I spammed it and it was worth it every time.
            I still am not sure if I like magnezone after more than a decade. Part of it is it just looks so much slower than magneton. I just picture the animations from Pokemon Colosseum where the magnemites in magneton are zipping around as they attack, and then think about how Magnezone's animations look and it just feels so much blander.
        There is a lack of Aggron on your list friend
        Your team is missing an aegislash there
    Same here. Big fan of max speed metagross surprising people.
    I am also on the Metagross train. All hail our robot overlord.
    Mine too! Woot woot! Too bad he‚Äôs pretty b tier in comp nowadays
Arcanine.

Majestic. Powerful. F L O O F Y.
    100% Agree! Arcanine is mine too! 

[I even drew a picture/card of it!](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/w26ypw/i_made_a_custom_holographic_arcanine_card/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)
        Looks awesome! Expect at least 1 order in August lol
    [deleted]
        Mudsdale? Rapidash? Dewgong? Hippowdon?
            Gogoat? It was the first you could actually ride around on. But everyone forgets poor Gogoat ‚òπÔ∏è
                Poor goat, but atleast its in 2 gens unlike plenty of gen 7 pokemon that's stuck tehre for the time being
        Not to mention extreme speed!! Running faster than Rapidash. I love them both though.
    My thoughts exactly
    I love Arcanine!
Idk about battling but I would make so many videos of my pet Chatots just like I do of my parrots.
    Pok√©mon a good at plenty of other things besides fighting üôÇ
        Did you know that Vaporeon is the most compa--
            No
Hatterene. 

Because I despise noisy people.
    Exploud in shambles
        Exploud, noivern, chatot, Rillaboom...
    This guy making explouds do more than faint üíÄ
Swampert
    Based
    one of my fav pokemon, so strong and has an incredible design. easily the best starter imo
    Swampert is my second but almost tied for first
    Scrolled to far for this.
        Probably because his (and mudkip's) popularity is so high that people think it's unoriginal now.
    Same
    You got some awesome taste
    So happy to see the love for swampert
    Easily my choice.
    Based
    Such a perfect design all around
My favorite has always been cloyster, with a very particular skill set that includes Shellsmash. I always imagined busting him out as my signature mon and people think "oh that thing's so slow" and then BOOM shellsmash and I have a super fast pearl bouncing around the field. And that kind of originality (not really) is why Im a gym leader.
    Shell smash+skill link icicle spear is awesome
        Yeah, my load out is always shellsmash, icicle spear, rock blast and then surf or something similar. Every gen I can have him, you bet I'm breeding one.
    Same for me. I never get tired of spamming icicle spear lol

Cloyster has a relatable personality too. I also put on a cool face, but will shut myself up in my house and refuse to leave when I‚Äôm stressed.
quagsire :)
    Had a friend who loved it, too. Named her Shiny one Swagsire
        SWAGSIRE I LOVE THAT
    My buddy ran a quagsire in our friend groups competitive run through of heart gold soul silver, gave it sandstorm and kept mudslap. For whatever reason, You just couldn‚Äôt hit that thing and it just smiled that empty smile at you your team slowly got whittled away  by the sand and mud
    Ahh. A fellow water-ground pokemon lover
    I love Quagsire. The chillest on the 'Mons
    Is that you Haydunn?
Mine would definitely be aggron, I just love em
    Aggron is one of the most badass Pok√©mon in the franchise. Easily one of my favourites.
        It‚Äôs a pokemon for the people too. About to go into the Hoenn Elite Four but feel like you need one more capable party member? Catch a lairon and train it two levels and bam, you have a physical wall.
    [CAN'T OUTSTALL THE WALL](https://youtu.be/bNzBAWdkWfw)
    Same! Aggron is my fav pokemon
    Me too! Came here to say this. Had to make sure our big mountain dinos were represented, and has the thought: we'd all have to be champions to afford its metal meals haha. Or buy a junkyard, I guess.
    My first game was gale of darkness for GameCube. Aron was the first wild Pok√©mon I caught and raised so now I‚Äôve always had a special attachment to this line.
My favorite, huge power Azumarill. Love that little wall breaker.
    ah, a fellow azumarill enjoyer
        ü§ù
    [deleted]
        THIS HAPPENED TO ME TOO. i had zero badges, 4 fuckin pokeballs, and my 3ds battery was almost dead. The panic! The joy! Azurill was my fave in BDSP I had it learn rain dance, perish song, sing, and light screen and hold a damp rock. Set up pichu with his little thunder ü•∞
Vaporeon.

*DON'T FUCKING SAY IT.*
    You know, Vaporeon is actually a pretty good choice, and I'm going to tell you why:

‚Ä¢It's good against fire types, like it's counterpart Flareon, or it can possibly hold its ground against a Charizard. Speaking of ground,

‚Ä¢ It's good against ground types, like Dugtrio and Hippowdon. It could take those two down, no problem, they'd have a bit of a "rocky" time trying to fight back. Speaking of rocky,

‚Ä¢ It's good against rock types, like Graveler and  Onix. Those two wouldn't stand a f**king chance against Vaporeon's water and ice type movesets. Speaking of f**king,

‚Ä¢ Vaporeon is quite possibly the most compatible for humans.
        *grabs iron pipe with murderous intent*
            Sir I'm going to have to ask you to lay pipe over there, this is a no piping zone.
                It's a no VAPOREON piping zone.
            If you make it a lead pipe it will eventually give you a bonus to murderous intent
                Rusty iron's pretty good at giving people tetanus.
        I love you and I want you dead.
    Hey guys,
        did you know that in terms of blunt weapons, a rusty iron pipe is the best way to shut someone horny up?
        PointCrow here. You ever get collector's anxiety?
    Coolest thing about Vaporeon is it can change its cells so that it looks like it turns into water, thus appearing invisible in water. Which is one of the most unique and interesting stealth abilities in all of pokemon.
    Fuckability aside, being able to become one with a body of water and then jump out of it (like that one stand in jojo) to attack is pretty baller. Flood the field and its free ambush hours.
    Love Vaporeon, wonderful for swimming and better than having a Glaceon since it can know water and ice moves
    Bro, my vaporeon randomly crit the champion on a nuzlocke, saving my run, but whenever I bring it up I get memed now.
    I‚Äôm with you! Been my very favorite since I was a kid playing RBY! 

When that post came out‚Ä¶üòîüòîüòîüòî
It would be my favorite light fixture Chandelure.
    Chandelure gang!
    I once did a Pokemon Y "Ghost only" playthrough, and Chandelure was my star. (And that, my dudes, is how Chandelure became my favorite Pokemon.)
    Chandelure stans rise up! To this day I still don't know how this ended up being my favorite mon lol
        For me, it sparked that middle school nostalgia/obsession I used to have with the nightmare before Christmas.
    Chandelure is such a cool Pok√©mon. I really love the design, it‚Äôs simultaneously adorable and spooky.
    Chandelure is sick. Still wish it got its intended Hidden Ability, Shadow Tag
My ace is Lapras.  I cant seem to play gen only runs because Nessie (female Lapras) or Chessie (male Lapras) always makes their way into the team.
    My head canon is that lapras‚Ä¶laprasses? Can telepathically communicate  with their owners after bonding, and their telepathic voice is Patrick Stewart
        I'm going to buy into that head canon with one tweak - female Lapras' voice is Dame Judi Dench
            Incredible choice but I would go for sir David Attenborough for my male lapras haha
                Nah, Morgan Freeman
            I'm going with Helen Mirren Lapras
        Lapralasses and Lapralads.
        *Lapri
    Ah someone of culture
    Lapras is my favorite for taking down all those dragon masters. "Oh noooo! You have dragons? How dangerous! It would be a shame if I should ICE BEAM! BLAME!!!"
Snorlax AKA Curselax. Would be that normal type Gym Leader that can get you off guard and send you to the closest Pok√©mon Center haha (like Whitney and her Miltank). 

Set up a couple Curse to make it bulky AF and increase the attack before starting the sweep.
    I never lost to Whitney the two times I fought her when I was younger, mostly because Cyndaquil learns smokescreen lol
        Haha yeah, I think it's basically a meme that started since many people struggled against her Miltank (caught them off guard or unprepared for this). Smoke screen or sand attack are valid strategies and avaiable early game.
            Moves that aren‚Äôt attack moves?? Get outta here with that nonsense I‚Äôm here to do damage and damage only
                Pretty much how my brain worked then as a child üòÖ
                Leer? Growl? Tail whip!? 

First moves to be deleted
    I want Snorlax for a normal type gym that‚Äôs one massive pillow fort with big soft carpets. Everything in there is a bulky normal type, so the whole affair is a singing, yawning, resting, snoring, sleep talk fest. 

Call the badge the snooze badge.
I've always said Vulpix would be my "Pikachu pokemon" ever since I was a little kid
    You might like Borne of caution then, the main character gets Isekai-ed into Pokemon and his main pokemon/starter is a Vulpix who he has a super close bond with.
        Is it like a webcomic?
            Like the other person said it's a fanfiction, but not at all the normal kind of fanfiction. More like a web novel that just happens to be set in a world that someone else came up with. It's already pretty long and the author has only finished the first act, so there's even more content ahead. They update like once a month.
                It's easily one of the best SI fanfics I've read.

What really sold it to me is that the protagonist, and presumably the author, is a zookeeper so he applies his IRL knowledge of animal care to Pok√©mons. Sometimes you get entire paragraphs dedicated to stuff like specific dietary requirements of Steel types, really cool, gives a National Geographic documentary vibe.
                That sounds exactly like the normal kind of fanfiction. People have an image of fanfiction always being shitty self-inserts or something horny, but most of it is just amateur writers using a setting they already know and love.
            Just googled, looks like a fanfiction!
    Kantonian Vulpix, I presume?
        Oh yeah, I like the Alolan variant too but OG all the way
    I love Vulpix too!
I like Togepi

A level 100 Togepi

Evolite
Nasty plot
Healing move
Dazzling gleam
Stored power







Or Absol us neat, I guess?
    Togepi, break his legs!
        Togepi, break the wrist and walk away!
        This comment does not have enough upvotes, I just pictured challenging the champion with only one pokemon, that cracked-out, beefed tf out Togepi. Thank you for referencing that meme
        Togepi, sweep the leg.
        Both of them.
    The healing move is Morning Sun
    Fear incarnate
    Omg i was about to comment togepi!! Suprised you love it too!
    Let's make your togepi special and let him have a fifth move being metronome. Just because metronome is the most fun move in the game to use.
easily everyone‚Äôs favorite doom doge Houndoom
    Absolutely one of my faves. Always catch one when I have the chance and name him/her Cerberus.
        Nice. I usually called mine hellhound for all my plays with it
    As much as I love Houndoom, I don't think I could join you. Pokedex says that if you get burnt by the flames it spews out, the pain will never go away.

All it takes is one dog burp or cough when petting your Houndoom and you're stuck with a fate worse than death for the rest of your days. No thanks. I'll stick with my other edgy dark pokemon favorite - Honchkrow.
        Dude really said no to the awesome fire dog in favor of the bird that commits tax fraud
    For me it's migthyena! I know it's not a strong one, but i love it regardless! In fact, i played a Pok√©mon themed dnd campaign a while ago and used mightyena as my starter and ace. When we got to a friendly pvp tournament, i managed to beat all other seven of my friends terrorizing everyone with that mightyena and winning the title of champion!
One of my two favorites, Gengar or Dragonite. Very hard ti choose between them.
    Mine would definitely be Gengar too! He's got so much personality plus great stats and movepool
        Gengar Gang! üëª
            Gengang!
                Gangar!
        Same here
    Dragonite all day for me!
    I 2nd that dragonite
Slowbro. We're both easy going and can take whatever life throws at us.
    Why did I have to scroll SO much to find another Slowbro enjoyer

*High-five*
        Alright! I'm not the only one. Hey, if you like Slowbro, check this out! https://i.redd.it/zfodus7fkpb51.png
    Finally I have found my people

Slowbro gang!
Probably Noctowl. Walking around with a giant Owl on my shoulder would likely scare the hell out of people lol!
    H-how strong are your shoulders? It's a 5' 90lb bird. I'm intimidated by the thought.
        Maybe I'll get a small Noctowl then lmao
            Some would call that a hoothoot
                Hmm true but I mean more like how in Lets Go and I think Sword and Shield some of the pokemon are smaller or larger.
    A wise old Noctowl that I inherited from my late grandfather. Its old and flies with a limp - it seems weak and unimposing but it‚Äôs sp. atk is maxed out and it Psychics the shit out of anyone that messes with me.
    It would look badass though!
This metal-head's signature Pok√©mon would definitely be Toxtricity
    As a fellow metalhead, I'd go reuniclus lol. No reason other than I love it
        I think both are very cool choices. Reuniclus is so slept on. I think it‚Äôs awesome
            Fr. It's just such a little guy
    I had no clue that was a Pokemon this is phenomenal
    This metalhead chooses blaziken as my signature Pokemon
    Just utterly destroying the League with "Master of Puppets"
        Two Toxicities (one bass and one guitar), a Rillaboom, and an Exploud.
            Add bronzong to play for whom the bell tolls
                And a Milktank for some cowbell
            You should have an obstagoon on that team!
    The Toxtricity of our city
Heracross. My favorite Pok√©mon of all time. Anytime he‚Äôs in game he‚Äôs my ace.
    This is my second choice, love Heracross ‚ù§Ô∏è
Either Espeon, Umbreon or Sylveon. Or all 3 together. I can't just choose one.
    Came here for the Eveelutions ‚ù§Ô∏è
    Taste
    i would choose espeon for sure
    I vote for Espeon. Always been one of my favourites since playing Pok√©mon Silver back in the day.
    That would be interesting a eeveelution based gym instead of a type based gym.
    What, no Jolteon? It's easily my favorite of the "Eeveelutions". But I'm biased towards Electric types, so...
Sableye.  Who wouldn't want that cute little gem ghost goblin to be your partner in crime.
    They look like a real hoot. Always getting into shenanigans.
        Yeah. I‚Äôm kind of sad that Team Rocket never had one in the show, I think a goofy little Sableye would have been a good team member.
            They are afraid of Sableyes power. Meowth would fade into obscurity within one episode of experiment #302 stealing the biggest diamond in Galar and having like a 5 minute chase scene with pikachu through alleyways, occasionally turning their head back and blowing raspberries as it danced about while Pikachu seriously chases after it
    Goblin? They kinda remind me of Stitch, actually.
Either Lucario or mimikyu I can‚Äôt choose I love them both
    I love Lucario; would definitely love to raise from an egg and evolve :)
    Those two are my favorites too!

Have an award for this exquisite taste lol
As an opera singer mine would be jigglypuff. :) just love her so much.
    I thought you were gonna say meloetta for a second there
        I‚Äôve actually never used her!
            Hell, I thought you were gonna say Primarina.
Typhlosion!!!!!
    Johtonian or Hisuian?
        Johto never have used him as a ghost type though that sounds awesome.
            You can change their forms with a special evolution stone called a brick
        Hisuian is superior in this case I think , the ghost type just makes him look so cool.
            Hisuian Typhlosion looks so much like Morty tbh
                It would actually make a cool ace for Morty if they ever decided to remake Gen 2 again.
                    \~*spoilers*\~
            Hisuian Typhlosion looks depressed
    Found Gold
    Yes! First pokemon I ever leveled to 100 in gen 2!
Without a doubt, Gible.
    Was going to say Garchomp for me. I‚Äôve never legitimately played a Pok√©mon game (save for emerald on an emulator), so I got brilliant diamond and when I unlocked access to the one cave I got Gible immediately. I named him Nugget and he‚Äôs been a permanent staple on my team ever since, and he alone helped me sweep so many late game encounters
    A Gible named Nibbles. Nibbles the Gibles is so quirky and fun to say
Torterra, I will never not love my giant land turtle baby. Assault Vest w/ Earthquake, giga drain, wood hammer, and stone edge. Either him or a sheer force braviary, muscle banded with only hard hitting moves
Gengar with out a doubt ...
As a maladaptive daydreamer probably musharna
Quagsire (fat just like me, and I love him)
Mamoswine
    Hello fellow ice type! There are dozens of us! ;_;

- Walrein gang
        I want Spheal, but my round boi will not evolve
            Spheal would for sure be my 'pikachu', wouldn't even be mad having two of the same evolution tree lol.
    Hello fellow ice type! There are dozens of us! ;_;

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Lapras gang
    Hello fellow ice type! There are dozens of us 
;_;

‚Ä¢ froslass gang
        Love that one too! Do you ever do a themed team? Whenever I can (have run through Sword but don't want to wipe that save, may get shield for this), I transfer in six ice types. I just ran through the elite 4 with a team of: Walrein, lapras (has gone through 4 games' elite 4s now with sword), alola Ninetails, alola sandslash, aurorus, and abomasnow, so much fun
        This is the comment I‚Äôve been looking for. Froslass was my first shiny :)
    Hello fellow ice type! There are dozens of us ;_;

‚Ä¢ Vanilluxe gang
    Hello fellow ice type! There are dozens of us ;_;

‚Ä¢ Cryogonal gang
        GOAT answer
Shedinja.
    Does it have final gambit?
        No, but it has my soul
    Is the Ninjask also on your team?
Dragapult
Bisharp, has always been and will always be my favorite mon.
    Bisharp is awesome
    You are going to like gen 9 :P
Toxicroak 100%
    Far too low on this list
Quagsire. It's a friend. A big tanky friend. :)
Definitely Arcanine! Could get around the world in a few minutes!
    My first introduction to Pokemon back in like 1996 was getting a Growlithe card from a friend. Ever since then Growlithe and Arcanine have been my favorite Pokemon. I 100% agree
    Arca-DOGGO GANG!!
Blaziken. He helped me so much through my Ruby playthrough. He means a lot to me that he's became my favorite starter.

Oh, and to make me somewhat notable, i'll have this moveset.

Blaze Kick

Sky Uppercut

Ember

and to top all this off,

Double Kick
    are you me ? haha, Double kick OP. Always love that move
Volcarona, hands down.
    Awesome, I actually use volcarona as my sweeper competitively
I would have either Golisopod or Dragapult
Probably one out of three Pok√©mon, Blastoise, Greninja or Gengar.
My signature pokemon would be Zoroark becuase Its my favorite pokemon
    I like running Zoroark and Lucario because they remind me of Sonic and Shadow
You probably could guess this based in my username but, Azumarill.
    Name gang!
Nidoking
    Nido gang! I‚Äôve tried to make physical sets on that thing work so many times. But sheer force plus that insane move pool just makes the king so fun
        I just wish his base stats were a little higher like 525ish
    Same here, Nidoking has been my favorite for a long time now, I even just finished a sheild playthrough with one as my main pokemon lol
Crustle.

I really like this Pokemon and it's cool design and I think it deserves more attention since it's not talked about enough imo. I think it would be a very cool ace to have if I was a Bug type Gym leader. With anime logic I also like that it could be used as a defensive rock type at the start of battles that can take a lot of hits and then at the end it can go all out with Shell Smash to become fast attacker and win close battles.
    I‚Äôm down with all bug types and Heracross is my favorite but I do love crustle. Cool design and I really like it‚Äôs shiny form.
There was a online battle simulator where you can made your team. Most people used to have average teams with all the most useful for PVP Pokemon. I went for a different route, having a mixed ground/grass team with Marowak as my main Pokemon.
Competitive wise, it was a bad team, but I enjoyed it and broke many prefab teams because it was totally unexpected for them.
    There is. Pokemon showdown.
A level 100 ivysaur
    You have my attention
Mega-Mawile. I'd pick steel type if I were a gym leader/E4, and Mega Mawile is not only my favorite, but also really strong.
    Scrolled way too far to find another fellow Mawile enjoyer. It's been my favorite Mon since forever
    Ayyyy me too!
Houndoom. Always loved it since I played Silver (yes, old Silver, this was over 20 years ago). It's a fire pooch! And it's Dark! Yes please.

Should've been a felony that you couldn't catch a Houndour until you almost beat the game.
Pidgeot
    I've always loves pidgeotto/pidgeot. Honestly I'm kind of a sucker for a lot of the early route birds in any gen
    At least someone likes it. Ash never came back for his
Either Aggron or Beedrill. They‚Äôre my two favourite Pok√©mon and I really like rock and bug-types
Sylveon. Dragon trainers shall learn to fear my weird dog thing
Aegislash.

Look at my user name and tell me that it's not my signature pokemon
    It's not your signature pokemon.
        Based af
        He‚Äôs been silent ever since this comment dropped
[removed]
Clawitzer
    Extremely underrated
Maractus. My favorite pokemon of all time because it's so adorable. Actually, all of my team would be pokemon i find cute
    I imagine if Mirror B ever showed up again, he‚Äôd have a Maractus.
Gogoat, specifically a shiny Gogoat!

It was my first shiny ever so it only makes sense for it to be my ace. Gogoat is also just underrated so much & I love seeing not so popular Pokemon being used by notable trainers.

Still mad that Ramos from Kalos doesn't have Gogoat as his ace Pokemon in Masters. It's his ace in game & anime - so the fact they gave him something else will forever bother me. Give my grass goat justice!
    I would actually also pick Gogoat! I work outdoors restoring habitat and could always use a mount-sized goat to get around. Great design and great combatant!
raichu :)
    Same! My favorite Pok√©mon ever since I was a child has been Raichu.
        plus Raichu wins the pokemon pun award I think. "I'm not gonna Raichu a love song" is hard to beat.
Armaldo
    Based
        I love both gen 3 fossils for different reasons. Armaldo for design and utility, cradily for bs stall.
What I would want: either Chandelure or Gardevoir
What I would actually get: Garbodor
Absol
    Finally. They are so bad ass
    Ah, nice. A fellow Edgeon enjoyer.
Salamence. It's such an intimidating, yet oddly cute pokemon.

Hate the 3d model still
Bulbasaur, i love plants so he helps me with my garden and all the pretty flowers
Gardevoir.

I don't have to justify myself to you.
    Gardevoir is an amazing pokemon
    Garde gets a lot of unfortunate attention for obvious reasons, but they're really awesome pokemon. They're loyal, deeply empathetic, and have some manner of precognition. They bond so strongly with trainers they care about that according to pokedex lore, they'll expend all their psychic power to tear apart spacetime itself if they sense that their trainer is in danger (which is fucking metal and has led to [one of my favorite pieces of fan art on the internet](https://i.imgur.com/NKKBhNA.jpg)).
        They really just went, "Boss is down? Okay, everyone dies."
        God fucking damnit this kinda art makes me want grim dark pokemon so badly. Show me some fucking PTSD ridden super animals that have literally wiped out nations because of their trauma. Show me the nuance and grit in a gaming version. In the show. Pokemon are literally super-animals and how the world transformed from them. It could be SUCH a well done story in both a game and an anime. Ugh :(
    The Fandom has done some nasty things to its reputation but its actually a good pokemon in the games.
    I also choose this guy's Gardevoir
    From an objective standpoint Gardevoir is actually a pretty good choice.  It has good special attack/defense, gets a mega evolution, and its typing is pretty good.  Psychic/Fairy means it's only weak to poison, steel, and ghost and can still hit poison types for super effective damage.  It doesn't take super effective damage from dark types and can actually hit them back with super effective damage which would be great for a psychic type gym leader or elite four member as well since most young/inexperienced trainers would only bring a dark type counter and wouldn't plan on dealing with something that's part fairy or fighting type like Gardevoir or Gallade.
AMBIPOM WITH SWIFT

my little happy boi shooting stars with his double slappy tail
Umbreon but a Lucario would be amazing too but with how little Lucario‚Äôs we saw in the show I‚Äôm assuming it is probably not possible
no legends, so sylveon (pixilate, pix plate, mooonblast, hypervoice, mystical fire, psyshock) or primarina (sparkling aria, hidden power ground, dive and moonblast, primarium z, torrent)
I‚Äôve always liked Grass type Pok√©mon and Roserade will be my signature
Id want it to be able mega evolve so probably Houndoom.  Literally keep it out of its pokeball always, itll be like im walking my dog lol
Feraligatr
Ma boi Swampert
MUDKIP LINE ALL THE WAY
Glaceon probably, but it's hard to choose just one. My ideal team for real life would be hisuian growlithe, alolan vulpix, noivern, sylveon, gastrodon, and glaceon as my signature one. But really any of those could be my signature and I'd he happy
Call me crazy, but Sawk.
[deleted]
Noivern! A noivern with boomburst and some other fun moves could be a good challenge to go against
H. Goodra, Reuniclus or Mudsdale
This is stretching the boundaries of the question a bit, but if Pokemon were real I'd be studying Eevee evolutions and searching for new ones. So in all likelihood, my signature Pokemon would be an Eeveelution that doesn't exist yet.


But if I can't have that, then either an Umbreon or a Sylveon.
Nidoking or Snorlax definitely they can learn so many moves and Snorlax is such an HP punching bag. I have a personal attachment to Nidoking always ends up in my final 6
Malamar. Such an underappreciated Pok√©mon, and my all-time favorite. But if I were to pick an unevolved Pok√©mon like Ash's Pikachu, I'd go with Misdreavus. My favorite prior to Malamar's reveal during the pre-XY days, lol.
Sceptile. Been my favorite Pok√©mon ever since gen 3 came out
I‚Äôm a doctor, so it probably will be Blissey, well but I love Gengar more. Definetely my kind of Pokemon
Guzzlord, it's my favorite pokemon
A shiny ditto
Weavile. Although not my favorite Pok√©mon of all time(that spot goes to either Decidueye or Charizard[X]) it definitely has access to one of my favorite moves.
skarmory!
Togekiss. He is good egg boi.
A little unoriginal but I'd have to go with dragonite.
Azumarill

It's cute
Definately Metagross. Good at battling and looks cool as f*ck
For me it‚Äôs charizard hands down I have had one on my team since playing red version as a kid so it would have to be there as my ace
Either Aggron or Emboar!
Gliscor 100%, my favourite Pok√©mon since I first saw it in-game in Pearl, and my bond to that mon's been strengthened even more after seeing it in the anime and recently using it competitively, I was SO happy seeing the beast it is (I feared it'd be trash competitively, since my favourites tend to end up being not so good unfortunately, like Meganium).

Gliscor's got so much personality, both in its design, poses etc. and in the anime. It's the perfect balance of cute, cool and scary (as I think I am lol), love the colours and the typing is icing on the cake - please don't "ice" it tho, it wouldn't appreciate it.

I also have almost the whole rest of my dream team already lol (or, the team I'd have if I was a Pokemon trainer in the anime, it's neither good nor balanced competitively - trust me, I've tried it XD): Gliscor, Sandaconda, Meganium, Lampent, Obstagoon, and then I'm unsure between Umbreon/Incineroar/Rowlet/Slowpoke. Gotta have some unevolved mons in an anime team lol, plus they're much better looking than people who focus only on fully evolved give them credit for.

A very Ice and Fighting weak team as you can see lol, so keep your Crabominable away from us! >:(
Garchomp.
One of 3:

My favorite Pok√©mon: Sharpedo

The Pok√©mon all my friends say fits my personality: Floatzel

And since those two are aces of other famous trainers, something to reflect my Huskies: Mightyena
Mimikyu  & I would be a raggedy patch work person

Primeape
Quagsire 100%
Talonflame, an underrated legend
Mimikyu.

Am a ghost trainer, was a hard choice.
100% Volcarona. Many a day dream about finding a larvesta in the wild and catching it because I have never seen one before. People made fun of it for being weak for our entire journey. Then when it is do or die (think ash's krabby) he evolves and wipes the floor. Favorite pokemon since the gen 5 encounter in the tower! So fluffy!

Add in Golurk and Noivern and you have my top 3! Gen 5 is so good dude. Grew up with 1 and 2 but 5 is def the best designs overall.
Since I am based, and it was my very first pokemon ever;
I'd have to pick up my trusted Infernape, just too good.
    Representüëä
Porygon-Z would be my ace.
Lucario all the way!
Ninetails/Venusaur
I'd say Hitmonchan. If pikachu can beat a Mega Gyarados, then I can work with my hitmonchan to real rocky/creed levels of finesse and beat up any anomaly - present and future; mega evolution, gigantamax, zmove, etc.

All while listening to eye of the tiger XD
Slazzle. Every thing i wish i was in a nutshell
Mantyke

I've solely used it to take down Kyurem-White in a Nuzlocke with no healing items. Mantyke is a monster
mimikyu! I want so badly to shower it in affection and help it fix it's costume. I'd probably put it in a babybjorn and carry it everywhere (with a healthy supply of mimikyu-approved snacks)
Alolan Ninetales
Dusknoir for me
Move set would be:
shadow ball
Earthquake
Metronome
 Darkest Lariat
As a programmer, I'd definitely team up with a metagross
    Why not PorygonZ?
        Why would they want to fix someone else's code? Just get a porygon and redo it all from scratch.
Espeon. Just always Espeon.
Quagsire. All day everyday.
Shiny Probopass would have to be mine 

*Hopefully Shiny Crystal Probopass soon
Rillaboom.

I think it would be nice to see me and expect something small, compact, simple, then my Pok√©mon being a Rillaboom.

And at first you look back at all the cute little baby pictures where a Grookey and Thwacky are playing with a younger me then halfway through my teen years there‚Äôs just Rillaboom.

He isn‚Äôt mean he just kinda exists. Acts like a toy breed dog.
Honestly, my signature Pok√©mon would depend on the time of day...... I like too many Pok√©mon to choose 1. XD

Morning - Typhlosion 

Midday - Feraligatr 

Dusk - Tyranitar

Night - Aggron


Bonus Points: The teams for them are vastly different.
Illumina Meganium. It counts
Golisopod or escavalier
Pfft, only the strongest Pok√©mon of all time. Clearly it would be Bidoof!
Kingler!

1. Higher attack stat than the Pok√©mon devil

2. Sounds similar to Cookie Monster 

I rest my case

(If in a game it would carry focus sash and know Agility + crabhammer + either X scissor, superpower/high horsepower)
I can't choose Meloetta, I'm not gonna pick Vaporeon for obvious reasons, so my third choice would be Raichu (Alolan or regular).
Weavile Gang
Snorlax.  I‚Äôm a big sleepy boy, he‚Äôs a big sleepy boy.
Probably Absol or Tyranitar (if I'm luxky) 

Eevee->Umbreon is my starter though, and I'd just let him out of the ball to walk with me
That's tough. Pidgeotto or Leafeon. Pidgeotto has been my #1 since Gen 1.
[deleted]
Shiftry. Its just my all around favorite pokemon; when it comes to game mechanics, its move pool changes, and rise and fall through the viability rankings, makes it a fascinating study of how the pokemon meta changes. Not just competitively, but even for ingame teams the variety from egg moves, move relearner/tutors, and TMs/TRs, mixed with its statline that isn't stand-out strong, but still viable, makes it just an interesting pokemon.

Not just that, but even with how its grown over the years, it hasn't lost its tengu theme origins; Its amazing movepool variety actually stays in-line with the various tengu legends. Its also an incredible example of competitive potential that hasn't lost its thematic touch.

With all that, when you consider it in-universe, Its not some super special pokemon. Its not a Legendary, a Mythical, a Pseudo, a Starter, or even some super rare route encounter. Its a semi-common mon, who's rarity comes from a final form stone evolution technically requiring some growth/ability as a trainer, while still being a semi achievable feat unlike Pokemon like Magmortar, Electivire, Rhyperior, Kingdra, etc. that required either a specialized item or dealing with dragons. Its a simple, 'everyman' Pokemon whose potential lets it reach far higher then you'd ever expect.
Gengar or Hisuian Typhlosion
Vaporeon. I will not explain further.
Probably my Crawdaunt from Alphasapphire as that‚Äôs been my most powerful teammate so far
Zoroark. It‚Äôs been my favorite Pok√©mon since my first Pok√©mon game
Toxapex for sure. competitive be damned, he‚Äôs just a funky lil guy in my heart
Sableye or Shedinja
mine would probably be a lurantis. powerful moves. probably not the best for fire types but still gives other types a run for their money
Noctowl
Cynadaquil will forever be my best friend
Cyndaquil!
Delphox.
Probably an Eevee, Jolteon, Rotom, or Sobble
this is  already done by cynthia, but garchomp probably, i just love the purple land shark
Has to be my boy crawdaunt
[removed]
Ima go with Goodra
Let's go with Litten. 

From the very beginning I've considered myself a Fire Type Pokemon Trainer. I'm a big fan of other types like Ice or Dragon, but Fire has always been the Top.

There's so many Fire Types that I could consider as my Signature. Charizard and its many forms have been my favorites since the start. Chandelure has been my computer's account icon since Pokemon Black. I love Houndoom, Zalazle, Infernape, Delphox, Rapidash, Volcarona, Centiskorch, Talonflame, and basically all of the rest.

But, I went with Litten because it can represent my favorite animal, the Tiger and because it looks good when it sits on your shoulder. It also has what I consider to be the best 1st stage form of any of the Starters.

I didn't go with Incineroar, because its design isn't one that I particularly liked when it was revealed. Didn't like the oversized hands, the goofy face, or the wrestler heel esthetics. I expected more for the Pokemon that would combine my favorite Animal and Element. That said, over the years the design has grown on me.  I played him quite a bit in Smash Bros and I don‚Äôt have negative opinions on it anymore. Still Litten looks better overall.
Sneasel! I've loved Sneasel since the beginning. It's got a great look, great later-gen movepool, seems like it's got a bit of snarky attitude which is fun, its pokedex entries make it seem a little unpleasant but ultimately we will rise above that via the power of friendship. Or we won't and I'll just let it be an absolute nightmare.
WAAAAAAAbuffet
Umbreon cuz defense is op
Altaria, coolest pok√©mon out there brotha
Samurott definitely
Mega Gallade
I'll throw a Mawile at you and end your career.
Definitely arcanine, it has always been my favorite pokemon
I wouldn't be a grass or dragon specialist, but my ace would be Flapple. Since I saw it for the first time in SwSh it has become my favourite Pok√©mon out of all. It is strange tho, cause my favourite type is Water, but I like Flapple more than I like water type Pok√©mon.
Definitely Zorua. Always wanted one when I started Pokemon Black on an emulator but sadly couldn't catch one :(
Quagsire! WWAAAAAAAA
Missingno. I like glitch pokemon.
You even need to ask?
i do love me some decidueye
Alolan Ninetales, my favorite pokemon
Aggron or Metagross or a tag team of both.
Eevee ‚ù§Ô∏è I know base Eevee is ‚Äúweak‚Äù but I love the Pok√©mon anyway
Lycanroc.

I love dogs, and Rockruff/Lycanroc are my go-to companion
Skarmory. I just think it's neat.
Female Meowstic. 

I do love a good cat.
Vulpix! Or Ninetails for the better moves and stats. Either way, the Vulpix line has been my favorite since I started playing Pokemon. I would 100% use Ninetails as my ace. The only question would be whether it was Kantonian or Alolan.
Hope you can tell by my username and current profile pic lol
Gastrodon
Scyther  :)
Muk. I never appreciated just how tanky and strong one could be. Give it minimize and acid armor and good luck trying to hit it, and even if you do it won't do much. That coupled with high attack and HP just make it a great pokemon, in my opinion.
Lycanroc would be my signature and my Ace
Greninja
I've always had a soft spot for Ampharos. It's definitely one of my favorite electric types.
When I was 9 I had an Ampharos called Pancake in my first play through of Pok√©mon Silver which was my favourite Pok√©mon ever, I basically only used Pancake for the entire run and he was at level 93 with over 500 hours played, but my cartridge (+ Gameboy Colour) was stolen when I was camping a couple of years later. I got a new copy and had Pancake II, and even though it wasn't the same it was still my favourite Pok√©mon.

I was so annoyed that they made Mareep incredibly rare on Pok√©mon Go when they released Gen 2.
    I had almost the exact same story with my Mightyena, Buddy, from Sapphire. He was named after a dog I had as a kid. I saved up my pocket money to buy the game, trained my little guy as basically the only 'mon I used, even transferred him onto my SoulSilver save when a friend in year 12 showed me you could do that. Then had my DS and all the games stolen, and I still miss Buddy.

I know they're just pixels and all, but I bet Buddy and Pancake are having fun together in their little digital afterlife.
Funny story. I had a Flaffy and didn't know she evolved. I was totally cool with this bipedal sheep. Then she evolved. Coolest gaming moments for me ever.  I was so surprised and loved my new weird giraffe with flippers.

Edit: I get flaffy and mareep confused my bad
    You say Mareep, but you describe Flaafy. I'm confused
        Meant flaffy lol
    My only gripe with ampharos is that it doesn't keep any wool as part of it's design :(
    My first ever pokemon game was yellow, so I used Pikachu all the way through. My second game was Silver. And ampharos was my new pikachu in that game
I hate that after two waves of DLC, we still don‚Äôt have Ampharos in SwSh.
    Didn't we see the Mareep line in one of the Scarlet/Violet trailers? If so, I'm grabbing one for my team ASAP.

Move over, Wooloo. The OG sheepy boi holds a place on my team.
        Always felt weird around the hype for Wooloo. "It's the first sheep/goat pokemon!"

Mareep and Skiddo cry in the background
The entire Mareep line is adorable!
Found Giovanni
    Too bad Nidoking is so short though.
        Short (nido)kings deserve love, too üëë
            So in Spanish you could translate its name to King of the Nest
                Sounds like a neat way of saying House Husband
The Nidos deserve more love. They're Pok√©mon royalty
    When I was young and dumb and didn‚Äôt do anything like ‚Äúbuild a Pok√©mon team‚Äù, I got through most of Pok√©mon Yellow with just Pikachu and a female Nidoran that I only caught at the start so that I could have an answer to Brock.

I stopped at Giovanni because uh, Ground and Water moves, and Pikachu and Nidoqueen were the only two at any sort of viable level.
    I was absolutely shocked they didn't get regional forms in Sword and Shield, what a missed opportunity.
    Holy shit. This comment thread is my 6 mon kings comp.
Fucking bad ass
That IS a good one!
Nice choice, I have a shiny Nidoking. First and only shiny. Got it from let‚Äôs go pikachu
Shiny Nidoking that knows surf. That would be my signature pokemon at my water gym.
Yes!!! Nidoking is a boss üëäüèª
Had shiny Nidoking in PLG and loved him. Always been a favorite of mine.
    Pokemon Legends Geodude?
        Yeah it‚Äôs my favorite game?
I finally found the Nidoking to my Nidoqueen.
Also been repping Nidoking now for about a
decade. Glad I still have my Burger King figurine of him.
Nidoqueen was always my girl for her double kick in pokemon yellow
Dragonite. Since 98'. OG Boys.
Empoleon gang represent! I'm a little bitter I can't bring mine into Sword/Shield
Hopefully you include ol' Delibird in your team to fit the theme
    Absolutely; Delibird's a staple for me in Johto
How do you feel about Eiscue?
    Love it! It's block head is so cute
Why no Eiscue
    I love Eiscue and Delibird as well! Piplup was just the first penguin Pokemon I had ever seen (my first game was Sapphire, so I didn't even know Delibird was a thing), and since it was also my starter, it was almost inevitable that it'd be my favorite
Love it. Unique pseudo legendary
    We need more pseudo legendaries that aren‚Äôt dragon types. Part of why I like Metagross so much.
        I will always consider volcarona as a pseudo, i know its stats dont add to 600 but it is a powerhouse that picks up a broom and slaughters teams that arent prepared.

Also the way it's presented (static mon) in BW gives legendary vibes.
            Just got a full stats shiny Volcarona Lvl 100 through wonder trade

E: I know it‚Äôs hacked lol not daft
        Fuck even Metagross had a gross type combo.

Rock dark just made it a corner stone for any strong rock or dark team.

I want more weak types to get some strong mons.
            I'm pretty sure back then steel types resisted dark & ghost so it neutralised the weaknesses
                Yep. You would have to come at it with Fire or Ground to get 2x
I've had the same Tyranitar on my team since HGSS
Me too , they did us dirty with the Mega Evolution tho
    Really? I thought it was cool.
        Yeah same with Heracross , bulkier and sharper doesnt mean better.
            Mega Heracross with multi hit moves was dope af though
Came looking for this one. Glad it's not too far down
Also why did Karen have Vileplume and Gengar when Tyranitar and Sneasel literally debuted that gen
Would you scream and shriek in the same manner?
    SKEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
You are a man of culture, I see
    A man of focus, determination, and sheer fucking taste
        "I once saw him KO 3 trainers in a gym..."

"With a Bellsprout, I've heard this story."

"With a fuc-king Bellsprout! Who the fuck can do that??"
            I love this
Victreebel has a such a great design and actually usable stats, but the movepool is so poor compared to others. It's a shame.
    It's more than capable of solo-ing any of the games tbqh
And then Victreebel tries to eat you. You never need Potions, you‚Äôre the Potion to heal it
Found James. Now where is Jessie and her Weezing? Also where is Meowth???!!?
Love the hatching goggles idea. Very creative üôÇ
    What is hatching from these goggles? üò±
        Trapinch
            Oh nos.
        Freshly hatched gogglings
Thank god Flygon wasn‚Äôt too far down. My ace without hesitation.
I think we would all travel and fly often if we could just ride dragons to work
Flygon was betrayed by game freak, such a cool Mon but garchomp stole the limelight, and then got a mega it didn't need, further relegating flygon into obscurity.
Crobat and Scolipede are easily my favorite poison-types.
    SCOLIPEDE IS SO COOL THO??!?!
Crobat, followed by his two BFFs and partners in crime, Toxicroak and Drapion. They make such a neat little mischievous-looking trio.
    I‚Äôve been called out, these are like my top 3 pokemon
Underrated af
    That bat HARD carried my first gen 2 playthrough. Love it forever
Just a team of 6 Cramorant, probably a rain setup, all of them have some sets with like air slash, roost, defog, surf, etc.
    Cant it learn huricane?
        yes
Cramorant gang!
I really wanna hug a Cramorant. Its ingame model has its wings spread out; the little derp looks like it wants a hug.
    Real life [cormorants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cormorant) often spread out their wings to dry them. Unlike most birds, their feathers are not fully waterprooof. This allows more efficient diving when they hunt for fish, but that also means they have to dry their wings off in the sun when they come back up.
Bonus points for the orange curry-colored shiny form.
I'm the exact same! I always name an Eevee Gizmo and evolve him to an Umbreon because I think they look alike. Giz was my first animal too (at age 11). He's an old man now and is dying but I find comfort I can still play with him through all my old games.
    Umbreon here, too.
That is wholesome.  I'd give an award if I could for it.
    I gotchu homie.
    Got you, fam.
Naming my next sandslash in a nuzlocke Chester
    Better honor that responsibility friend - keep the flame alive!
Oh yah, Metagross is mine. 

I'd do an all metal gym. Metagross. Lucario if that's ok. Steelix, empoleon bastiodon magneton. 

Steel gym leader would be my shiiiiiiittttt
    Would you stick with the Magneton or go Magnezone?
        Magnezone with zap cannon was sooo cool in the games. I didn‚Äôt care that it rarely hit, I spammed it and it was worth it every time.
        I still am not sure if I like magnezone after more than a decade. Part of it is it just looks so much slower than magneton. I just picture the animations from Pokemon Colosseum where the magnemites in magneton are zipping around as they attack, and then think about how Magnezone's animations look and it just feels so much blander.
    There is a lack of Aggron on your list friend
    Your team is missing an aegislash there
Same here. Big fan of max speed metagross surprising people.
I am also on the Metagross train. All hail our robot overlord.
Mine too! Woot woot! Too bad he‚Äôs pretty b tier in comp nowadays
100% Agree! Arcanine is mine too! 

[I even drew a picture/card of it!](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/w26ypw/i_made_a_custom_holographic_arcanine_card/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

            Poor goat, but atleast its in 2 gens unlike plenty of gen 7 pokemon that's stuck tehre for the time being
    Not to mention extreme speed!! Running faster than Rapidash. I love them both though.
My thoughts exactly
I love Arcanine!

one of my fav pokemon, so strong and has an incredible design. easily the best starter imo
Swampert is my second but almost tied for first
Scrolled to far for this.
    Probably because his (and mudkip's) popularity is so high that people think it's unoriginal now.
Same
You got some awesome taste
So happy to see the love for swampert
Easily my choice.
Based
Such a perfect design all around
Shell smash+skill link icicle spear is awesome
    Yeah, my load out is always shellsmash, icicle spear, rock blast and then surf or something similar. Every gen I can have him, you bet I'm breeding one.
Same for me. I never get tired of spamming icicle spear lol

Cloyster has a relatable personality too. I also put on a cool face, but will shut myself up in my house and refuse to leave when I‚Äôm stressed.
Had a friend who loved it, too. Named her Shiny one Swagsire
    SWAGSIRE I LOVE THAT
My buddy ran a quagsire in our friend groups competitive run through of heart gold soul silver, gave it sandstorm and kept mudslap. For whatever reason, You just couldn‚Äôt hit that thing and it just smiled that empty smile at you your team slowly got whittled away  by the sand and mud
Ahh. A fellow water-ground pokemon lover
I love Quagsire. The chillest on the 'Mons
Is that you Haydunn?
Aggron is one of the most badass Pok√©mon in the franchise. Easily one of my favourites.
    It‚Äôs a pokemon for the people too. About to go into the Hoenn Elite Four but feel like you need one more capable party member? Catch a lairon and train it two levels and bam, you have a physical wall.
[CAN'T OUTSTALL THE WALL](https://youtu.be/bNzBAWdkWfw)
Same! Aggron is my fav pokemon
Me too! Came here to say this. Had to make sure our big mountain dinos were represented, and has the thought: we'd all have to be champions to afford its metal meals haha. Or buy a junkyard, I guess.
My first game was gale of darkness for GameCube. Aron was the first wild Pok√©mon I caught and raised so now I‚Äôve always had a special attachment to this line.
ah, a fellow azumarill enjoyer

[deleted]
    THIS HAPPENED TO ME TOO. i had zero badges, 4 fuckin pokeballs, and my 3ds battery was almost dead. The panic! The joy! Azurill was my fave in BDSP I had it learn rain dance, perish song, sing, and light screen and hold a damp rock. Set up pichu with his little thunder ü•∞
You know, Vaporeon is actually a pretty good choice, and I'm going to tell you why:

‚Ä¢It's good against fire types, like it's counterpart Flareon, or it can possibly hold its ground against a Charizard. Speaking of ground,

‚Ä¢ It's good against ground types, like Dugtrio and Hippowdon. It could take those two down, no problem, they'd have a bit of a "rocky" time trying to fight back. Speaking of rocky,

‚Ä¢ It's good against rock types, like Graveler and  Onix. Those two wouldn't stand a f**king chance against Vaporeon's water and ice type movesets. Speaking of f**king,

‚Ä¢ Vaporeon is quite possibly the most compatible for humans.
    *grabs iron pipe with murderous intent*
        Sir I'm going to have to ask you to lay pipe over there, this is a no piping zone.
            It's a no VAPOREON piping zone.
        If you make it a lead pipe it will eventually give you a bonus to murderous intent
            Rusty iron's pretty good at giving people tetanus.
    I love you and I want you dead.
Hey guys,
    did you know that in terms of blunt weapons, a rusty iron pipe is the best way to shut someone horny up?
    PointCrow here. You ever get collector's anxiety?
Coolest thing about Vaporeon is it can change its cells so that it looks like it turns into water, thus appearing invisible in water. Which is one of the most unique and interesting stealth abilities in all of pokemon.
Fuckability aside, being able to become one with a body of water and then jump out of it (like that one stand in jojo) to attack is pretty baller. Flood the field and its free ambush hours.
Love Vaporeon, wonderful for swimming and better than having a Glaceon since it can know water and ice moves
Bro, my vaporeon randomly crit the champion on a nuzlocke, saving my run, but whenever I bring it up I get memed now.
I‚Äôm with you! Been my very favorite since I was a kid playing RBY!

Chandelure gang!
I once did a Pokemon Y "Ghost only" playthrough, and Chandelure was my star. (And that, my dudes, is how Chandelure became my favorite Pokemon.)
Chandelure stans rise up! To this day I still don't know how this ended up being my favorite mon lol
    For me, it sparked that middle school nostalgia/obsession I used to have with the nightmare before Christmas.
Chandelure is such a cool Pok√©mon. I really love the design, it‚Äôs simultaneously adorable and spooky.
Chandelure is sick. Still wish it got its intended Hidden Ability, Shadow Tag
My head canon is that lapras‚Ä¶laprasses? Can telepathically communicate  with their owners after bonding, and their telepathic voice is Patrick Stewart
    I'm going to buy into that head canon with one tweak - female Lapras' voice is Dame Judi Dench
        Incredible choice but I would go for sir David Attenborough for my male lapras haha
            Nah, Morgan Freeman
        I'm going with Helen Mirren Lapras
    Lapralasses and Lapralads.
    *Lapri
Ah someone of culture
Lapras is my favorite for taking down all those dragon masters. "Oh noooo! You have dragons? How dangerous! It would be a shame if I should ICE BEAM! BLAME!!!"
I never lost to Whitney the two times I fought her when I was younger, mostly because Cyndaquil learns smokescreen lol
    Haha yeah, I think it's basically a meme that started since many people struggled against her Miltank (caught them off guard or unprepared for this). Smoke screen or sand attack are valid strategies and avaiable early game.
        Moves that aren‚Äôt attack moves?? Get outta here with that nonsense I‚Äôm here to do damage and damage only
            Pretty much how my brain worked then as a child üòÖ
            Leer? Growl? Tail whip!? 

First moves to be deleted
I want Snorlax for a normal type gym that‚Äôs one massive pillow fort with big soft carpets. Everything in there is a bulky normal type, so the whole affair is a singing, yawning, resting, snoring, sleep talk fest. 

Call the badge the snooze badge.
You might like Borne of caution then, the main character gets Isekai-ed into Pokemon and his main pokemon/starter is a Vulpix who he has a super close bond with.
    Is it like a webcomic?
        Like the other person said it's a fanfiction, but not at all the normal kind of fanfiction. More like a web novel that just happens to be set in a world that someone else came up with. It's already pretty long and the author has only finished the first act, so there's even more content ahead. They update like once a month.
            It's easily one of the best SI fanfics I've read.

What really sold it to me is that the protagonist, and presumably the author, is a zookeeper so he applies his IRL knowledge of animal care to Pok√©mons. Sometimes you get entire paragraphs dedicated to stuff like specific dietary requirements of Steel types, really cool, gives a National Geographic documentary vibe.
            That sounds exactly like the normal kind of fanfiction. People have an image of fanfiction always being shitty self-inserts or something horny, but most of it is just amateur writers using a setting they already know and love.
        Just googled, looks like a fanfiction!
Kantonian Vulpix, I presume?
    Oh yeah, I like the Alolan variant too but OG all the way
I love Vulpix too!
Togepi, break his legs!
    Togepi, break the wrist and walk away!
    This comment does not have enough upvotes, I just pictured challenging the champion with only one pokemon, that cracked-out, beefed tf out Togepi. Thank you for referencing that meme
    Togepi, sweep the leg.
    Both of them.
The healing move is Morning Sun
Fear incarnate
Omg i was about to comment togepi!! Suprised you love it too!
Let's make your togepi special and let him have a fifth move being metronome. Just because metronome is the most fun move in the game to use.
Absolutely one of my faves. Always catch one when I have the chance and name him/her Cerberus.
    Nice. I usually called mine hellhound for all my plays with it
As much as I love Houndoom, I don't think I could join you. Pokedex says that if you get burnt by the flames it spews out, the pain will never go away.

All it takes is one dog burp or cough when petting your Houndoom and you're stuck with a fate worse than death for the rest of your days. No thanks. I'll stick with my other edgy dark pokemon favorite - Honchkrow.
    Dude really said no to the awesome fire dog in favor of the bird that commits tax fraud
For me it's migthyena! I know it's not a strong one, but i love it regardless! In fact, i played a Pok√©mon themed dnd campaign a while ago and used mightyena as my starter and ace. When we got to a friendly pvp tournament, i managed to beat all other seven of my friends terrorizing everyone with that mightyena and winning the title of champion!
Mine would definitely be Gengar too! He's got so much personality plus great stats and movepool
    Gengar Gang! üëª
        Gengang!

Why did I have to scroll SO much to find another Slowbro enjoyer

*High-five*
    Alright! I'm not the only one. Hey, if you like Slowbro, check this out! https://i.redd.it/zfodus7fkpb51.png
Finally I have found my people

Slowbro gang!
H-how strong are your shoulders? It's a 5' 90lb bird. I'm intimidated by the thought.
    Maybe I'll get a small Noctowl then lmao
        Some would call that a hoothoot
            Hmm true but I mean more like how in Lets Go and I think Sword and Shield some of the pokemon are smaller or larger.
A wise old Noctowl that I inherited from my late grandfather. Its old and flies with a limp - it seems weak and unimposing but it‚Äôs sp. atk is maxed out and it Psychics the shit out of anyone that messes with me.
It would look badass though!
As a fellow metalhead, I'd go reuniclus lol. No reason other than I love it
    I think both are very cool choices. Reuniclus is so slept on. I think it‚Äôs awesome
        Fr. It's just such a little guy
I had no clue that was a Pokemon this is phenomenal
This metalhead chooses blaziken as my signature Pokemon
Just utterly destroying the League with "Master of Puppets"
    Two Toxicities (one bass and one guitar), a Rillaboom, and an Exploud.
        Add bronzong to play for whom the bell tolls
            And a Milktank for some cowbell
        You should have an obstagoon on that team!
The Toxtricity of our city
This is my second choice, love Heracross ‚ù§Ô∏è
Came here for the Eveelutions ‚ù§Ô∏è
Taste
i would choose espeon for sure
I vote for Espeon. Always been one of my favourites since playing Pok√©mon Silver back in the day.
That would be interesting a eeveelution based gym instead of a type based gym.
What, no Jolteon? It's easily my favorite of the "Eeveelutions". But I'm biased towards Electric types, so...
They look like a real hoot. Always getting into shenanigans.
    Yeah. I‚Äôm kind of sad that Team Rocket never had one in the show, I think a goofy little Sableye would have been a good team member.
        They are afraid of Sableyes power. Meowth would fade into obscurity within one episode of experiment #302 stealing the biggest diamond in Galar and having like a 5 minute chase scene with pikachu through alleyways, occasionally turning their head back and blowing raspberries as it danced about while Pikachu seriously chases after it
Goblin? They kinda remind me of Stitch, actually.
I love Lucario; would definitely love to raise from an egg and evolve :)
Those two are my favorites too!

Have an award for this exquisite taste lol
I thought you were gonna say meloetta for a second there
    I‚Äôve actually never used her!
        Hell, I thought you were gonna say Primarina.
Johtonian or Hisuian?
    Johto never have used him as a ghost type though that sounds awesome.
        You can change their forms with a special evolution stone called a brick
    Hisuian is superior in this case I think , the ghost type just makes him look so cool.
        Hisuian Typhlosion looks so much like Morty tbh
            It would actually make a cool ace for Morty if they ever decided to remake Gen 2 again.
                \~*spoilers*\~
        Hisuian Typhlosion looks depressed
Found Gold
Yes! First pokemon I ever leveled to 100 in gen 2!
Was going to say Garchomp for me. I‚Äôve never legitimately played a Pok√©mon game (save for emerald on an emulator), so I got brilliant diamond and when I unlocked access to the one cave I got Gible immediately. I named him Nugget and he‚Äôs been a permanent staple on my team ever since, and he alone helped me sweep so many late game encounters
A Gible named Nibbles. Nibbles the Gibles is so quirky and fun to say
Hello fellow ice type! There are dozens of us! ;_;

- Walrein gang
    I want Spheal, but my round boi will not evolve
        Spheal would for sure be my 'pikachu', wouldn't even be mad having two of the same evolution tree lol.
Hello fellow ice type! There are dozens of us! ;_;

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Lapras gang
Hello fellow ice type! There are dozens of us 
;_;

‚Ä¢ froslass gang
    Love that one too! Do you ever do a themed team? Whenever I can (have run through Sword but don't want to wipe that save, may get shield for this), I transfer in six ice types. I just ran through the elite 4 with a team of: Walrein, lapras (has gone through 4 games' elite 4s now with sword), alola Ninetails, alola sandslash, aurorus, and abomasnow, so much fun
    This is the comment I‚Äôve been looking for. Froslass was my first shiny :)
Hello fellow ice type! There are dozens of us ;_;

Does it have final gambit?
    No, but it has my soul
Is the Ninjask also on your team?
Bisharp is awesome
You are going to like gen 9 :P
Far too low on this list
My first introduction to Pokemon back in like 1996 was getting a Growlithe card from a friend. Ever since then Growlithe and Arcanine have been my favorite Pokemon. I 100% agree
Arca-DOGGO GANG!!
are you me ? haha, Double kick OP. Always love that move
Awesome, I actually use volcarona as my sweeper competitively
I like running Zoroark and Lucario because they remind me of Sonic and Shadow
Name gang!
Nido gang! I‚Äôve tried to make physical sets on that thing work so many times. But sheer force plus that insane move pool just makes the king so fun
    I just wish his base stats were a little higher like 525ish
Same here, Nidoking has been my favorite for a long time now, I even just finished a sheild playthrough with one as my main pokemon lol
I‚Äôm down with all bug types and Heracross is my favorite but I do love crustle. Cool design and I really like it‚Äôs shiny form.
There is. Pokemon showdown.
You have my attention
Scrolled way too far to find another fellow Mawile enjoyer. It's been my favorite Mon since forever
Ayyyy me too!
I've always loves pidgeotto/pidgeot. Honestly I'm kind of a sucker for a lot of the early route birds in any gen
At least someone likes it. Ash never came back for his
It's not your signature pokemon.
    Based af
    He‚Äôs been silent ever since this comment dropped
Extremely underrated
I imagine if Mirror B ever showed up again, he‚Äôd have a Maractus.
I would actually also pick Gogoat! I work outdoors restoring habitat and could always use a mount-sized goat to get around. Great design and great combatant!
Same! My favorite Pok√©mon ever since I was a child has been Raichu.
    plus Raichu wins the pokemon pun award I think. "I'm not gonna Raichu a love song" is hard to beat.

    I love both gen 3 fossils for different reasons. Armaldo for design and utility, cradily for bs stall.
Finally. They are so bad ass
Ah, nice. A fellow Edgeon enjoyer.
Gardevoir is an amazing pokemon
Garde gets a lot of unfortunate attention for obvious reasons, but they're really awesome pokemon. They're loyal, deeply empathetic, and have some manner of precognition. They bond so strongly with trainers they care about that according to pokedex lore, they'll expend all their psychic power to tear apart spacetime itself if they sense that their trainer is in danger (which is fucking metal and has led to [one of my favorite pieces of fan art on the internet](https://i.imgur.com/NKKBhNA.jpg)).
    They really just went, "Boss is down? Okay, everyone dies."
    God fucking damnit this kinda art makes me want grim dark pokemon so badly. Show me some fucking PTSD ridden super animals that have literally wiped out nations because of their trauma. Show me the nuance and grit in a gaming version. In the show. Pokemon are literally super-animals and how the world transformed from them. It could be SUCH a well done story in both a game and an anime. Ugh :(
The Fandom has done some nasty things to its reputation but its actually a good pokemon in the games.
I also choose this guy's Gardevoir
From an objective standpoint Gardevoir is actually a pretty good choice.  It has good special attack/defense, gets a mega evolution, and its typing is pretty good.  Psychic/Fairy means it's only weak to poison, steel, and ghost and can still hit poison types for super effective damage.  It doesn't take super effective damage from dark types and can actually hit them back with super effective damage which would be great for a psychic type gym leader or elite four member as well since most young/inexperienced trainers would only bring a dark type counter and wouldn't plan on dealing with something that's part fairy or fighting type like Gardevoir or Gallade.
Representüëä
Why not PorygonZ?
    Why would they want to fix someone else's code? Just get a porygon and redo it all from scratch.
I had almost the exact same story with my Mightyena, Buddy, from Sapphire. He was named after a dog I had as a kid. I saved up my pocket money to buy the game, trained my little guy as basically the only 'mon I used, even transferred him onto my SoulSilver save when a friend in year 12 showed me you could do that. Then had my DS and all the games stolen, and I still miss Buddy.

I know they're just pixels and all, but I bet Buddy and Pancake are having fun together in their little digital afterlife.
You say Mareep, but you describe Flaafy. I'm confused
    Meant flaffy lol
My only gripe with ampharos is that it doesn't keep any wool as part of it's design :(
My first ever pokemon game was yellow, so I used Pikachu all the way through. My second game was Silver. And ampharos was my new pikachu in that game
Didn't we see the Mareep line in one of the Scarlet/Violet trailers? If so, I'm grabbing one for my team ASAP.

Move over, Wooloo. The OG sheepy boi holds a place on my team.
    Always felt weird around the hype for Wooloo. "It's the first sheep/goat pokemon!"

Mareep and Skiddo cry in the background
Too bad Nidoking is so short though.
    Short (nido)kings deserve love, too üëë
        So in Spanish you could translate its name to King of the Nest
            Sounds like a neat way of saying House Husband
When I was young and dumb and didn‚Äôt do anything like ‚Äúbuild a Pok√©mon team‚Äù, I got through most of Pok√©mon Yellow with just Pikachu and a female Nidoran that I only caught at the start so that I could have an answer to Brock.

I stopped at Giovanni because uh, Ground and Water moves, and Pikachu and Nidoqueen were the only two at any sort of viable level.
I was absolutely shocked they didn't get regional forms in Sword and Shield, what a missed opportunity.
Holy shit. This comment thread is my 6 mon kings comp.
Pokemon Legends Geodude?
    Yeah it‚Äôs my favorite game?
Absolutely; Delibird's a staple for me in Johto
Love it! It's block head is so cute
I love Eiscue and Delibird as well! Piplup was just the first penguin Pokemon I had ever seen (my first game was Sapphire, so I didn't even know Delibird was a thing), and since it was also my starter, it was almost inevitable that it'd be my favorite
We need more pseudo legendaries that aren‚Äôt dragon types. Part of why I like Metagross so much.
    I will always consider volcarona as a pseudo, i know its stats dont add to 600 but it is a powerhouse that picks up a broom and slaughters teams that arent prepared.

Also the way it's presented (static mon) in BW gives legendary vibes.
        Just got a full stats shiny Volcarona Lvl 100 through wonder trade

E: I know it‚Äôs hacked lol not daft
    Fuck even Metagross had a gross type combo.

Rock dark just made it a corner stone for any strong rock or dark team.

I want more weak types to get some strong mons.
        I'm pretty sure back then steel types resisted dark & ghost so it neutralised the weaknesses
            Yep. You would have to come at it with Fire or Ground to get 2x
Really? I thought it was cool.
    Yeah same with Heracross , bulkier and sharper doesnt mean better.
        Mega Heracross with multi hit moves was dope af though
SKEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
A man of focus, determination, and sheer fucking taste
    "I once saw him KO 3 trainers in a gym..."

"With a Bellsprout, I've heard this story."

"With a fuc-king Bellsprout! Who the fuck can do that??"
        I love this
It's more than capable of solo-ing any of the games tbqh

That bat HARD carried my first gen 2 playthrough. Love it forever
Cant it learn huricane?
    yes
Real life [cormorants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cormorant) often spread out their wings to dry them. Unlike most birds, their feathers are not fully waterprooof. This allows more efficient diving when they hunt for fish, but that also means they have to dry their wings off in the sun when they come back up.
Umbreon here, too.
I gotchu homie.
Got you, fam.
Better honor that responsibility friend - keep the flame alive!
Would you stick with the Magneton or go Magnezone?
    Magnezone with zap cannon was sooo cool in the games. I didn‚Äôt care that it rarely hit, I spammed it and it was worth it every time.
    I still am not sure if I like magnezone after more than a decade. Part of it is it just looks so much slower than magneton. I just picture the animations from Pokemon Colosseum where the magnemites in magneton are zipping around as they attack, and then think about how Magnezone's animations look and it just feels so much blander.
There is a lack of Aggron on your list friend
Your team is missing an aegislash there
Looks awesome! Expect at least 1 order in August lol
Mudsdale? Rapidash? Dewgong? Hippowdon?
    Gogoat? It was the first you could actually ride around on. But everyone forgets poor Gogoat ‚òπÔ∏è
        Poor goat, but atleast its in 2 gens unlike plenty of gen 7 pokemon that's stuck tehre for the time being
Not to mention extreme speed!! Running faster than Rapidash. I love them both though.
Did you know that Vaporeon is the most compa--
    No
Exploud, noivern, chatot, Rillaboom...
Probably because his (and mudkip's) popularity is so high that people think it's unoriginal now.
Yeah, my load out is always shellsmash, icicle spear, rock blast and then surf or something similar. Every gen I can have him, you bet I'm breeding one.
SWAGSIRE I LOVE THAT
It‚Äôs a pokemon for the people too. About to go into the Hoenn Elite Four but feel like you need one more capable party member? Catch a lairon and train it two levels and bam, you have a physical wall.
ü§ù
THIS HAPPENED TO ME TOO. i had zero badges, 4 fuckin pokeballs, and my 3ds battery was almost dead. The panic! The joy! Azurill was my fave in BDSP I had it learn rain dance, perish song, sing, and light screen and hold a damp rock. Set up pichu with his little thunder ü•∞
*grabs iron pipe with murderous intent*
    Sir I'm going to have to ask you to lay pipe over there, this is a no piping zone.
        It's a no VAPOREON piping zone.
    If you make it a lead pipe it will eventually give you a bonus to murderous intent
        Rusty iron's pretty good at giving people tetanus.
I love you and I want you dead.
did you know that in terms of blunt weapons, a rusty iron pipe is the best way to shut someone horny up?
PointCrow here. You ever get collector's anxiety?
For me, it sparked that middle school nostalgia/obsession I used to have with the nightmare before Christmas.
I'm going to buy into that head canon with one tweak - female Lapras' voice is Dame Judi Dench
    Incredible choice but I would go for sir David Attenborough for my male lapras haha
        Nah, Morgan Freeman
    I'm going with Helen Mirren Lapras
Lapralasses and Lapralads.
*Lapri
Haha yeah, I think it's basically a meme that started since many people struggled against her Miltank (caught them off guard or unprepared for this). Smoke screen or sand attack are valid strategies and avaiable early game.
    Moves that aren‚Äôt attack moves?? Get outta here with that nonsense I‚Äôm here to do damage and damage only
        Pretty much how my brain worked then as a child üòÖ
        Leer? Growl? Tail whip!?

Is it like a webcomic?
    Like the other person said it's a fanfiction, but not at all the normal kind of fanfiction. More like a web novel that just happens to be set in a world that someone else came up with. It's already pretty long and the author has only finished the first act, so there's even more content ahead. They update like once a month.
        It's easily one of the best SI fanfics I've read.

What really sold it to me is that the protagonist, and presumably the author, is a zookeeper so he applies his IRL knowledge of animal care to Pok√©mons. Sometimes you get entire paragraphs dedicated to stuff like specific dietary requirements of Steel types, really cool, gives a National Geographic documentary vibe.
        That sounds exactly like the normal kind of fanfiction. People have an image of fanfiction always being shitty self-inserts or something horny, but most of it is just amateur writers using a setting they already know and love.
    Just googled, looks like a fanfiction!
Oh yeah, I like the Alolan variant too but OG all the way
Togepi, break the wrist and walk away!
This comment does not have enough upvotes, I just pictured challenging the champion with only one pokemon, that cracked-out, beefed tf out Togepi. Thank you for referencing that meme
Togepi, sweep the leg.
Both of them.
Nice. I usually called mine hellhound for all my plays with it
Dude really said no to the awesome fire dog in favor of the bird that commits tax fraud
Gengar Gang! üëª
    Gengang!
        Gangar!
Same here
Alright! I'm not the only one. Hey, if you like Slowbro, check this out! https://i.redd.it/zfodus7fkpb51.png
Maybe I'll get a small Noctowl then lmao
    Some would call that a hoothoot
        Hmm true but I mean more like how in Lets Go and I think Sword and Shield some of the pokemon are smaller or larger.
I think both are very cool choices. Reuniclus is so slept on. I think it‚Äôs awesome
    Fr. It's just such a little guy
Two Toxicities (one bass and one guitar), a Rillaboom, and an Exploud.
    Add bronzong to play for whom the bell tolls
        And a Milktank for some cowbell
    You should have an obstagoon on that team!
Yeah. I‚Äôm kind of sad that Team Rocket never had one in the show, I think a goofy little Sableye would have been a good team member.
    They are afraid of Sableyes power. Meowth would fade into obscurity within one episode of experiment #302 stealing the biggest diamond in Galar and having like a 5 minute chase scene with pikachu through alleyways, occasionally turning their head back and blowing raspberries as it danced about while Pikachu seriously chases after it
I‚Äôve actually never used her!
    Hell, I thought you were gonna say Primarina.
Johto never have used him as a ghost type though that sounds awesome.
    You can change their forms with a special evolution stone called a brick
Hisuian is superior in this case I think , the ghost type just makes him look so cool.
    Hisuian Typhlosion looks so much like Morty tbh
        It would actually make a cool ace for Morty if they ever decided to remake Gen 2 again.
            \~*spoilers*\~
    Hisuian Typhlosion looks depressed
I want Spheal, but my round boi will not evolve
    Spheal would for sure be my 'pikachu', wouldn't even be mad having two of the same evolution tree lol.
Love that one too! Do you ever do a themed team? Whenever I can (have run through Sword but don't want to wipe that save, may get shield for this), I transfer in six ice types. I just ran through the elite 4 with a team of: Walrein, lapras (has gone through 4 games' elite 4s now with sword), alola Ninetails, alola sandslash, aurorus, and abomasnow, so much fun
This is the comment I‚Äôve been looking for. Froslass was my first shiny :)
GOAT answer
No, but it has my soul
I just wish his base stats were a little higher like 525ish
Based af
He‚Äôs been silent ever since this comment dropped
plus Raichu wins the pokemon pun award I think. "I'm not gonna Raichu a love song" is hard to beat.
I love both gen 3 fossils for different reasons. Armaldo for design and utility, cradily for bs stall.
They really just went, "Boss is down? Okay, everyone dies."
God fucking damnit this kinda art makes me want grim dark pokemon so badly. Show me some fucking PTSD ridden super animals that have literally wiped out nations because of their trauma. Show me the nuance and grit in a gaming version. In the show. Pokemon are literally super-animals and how the world transformed from them. It could be SUCH a well done story in both a game and an anime. Ugh :(
Why would they want to fix someone else's code? Just get a porygon and redo it all from scratch.
Meant flaffy lol
Always felt weird around the hype for Wooloo. "It's the first sheep/goat pokemon!"

Mareep and Skiddo cry in the background
Short (nido)kings deserve love, too üëë
    So in Spanish you could translate its name to King of the Nest
        Sounds like a neat way of saying House Husband
Yeah it‚Äôs my favorite game?
I will always consider volcarona as a pseudo, i know its stats dont add to 600 but it is a powerhouse that picks up a broom and slaughters teams that arent prepared.

Also the way it's presented (static mon) in BW gives legendary vibes.
    Just got a full stats shiny Volcarona Lvl 100 through wonder trade

E: I know it‚Äôs hacked lol not daft
Fuck even Metagross had a gross type combo.

Rock dark just made it a corner stone for any strong rock or dark team.

I want more weak types to get some strong mons.
    I'm pretty sure back then steel types resisted dark & ghost so it neutralised the weaknesses
        Yep. You would have to come at it with Fire or Ground to get 2x
Yeah same with Heracross , bulkier and sharper doesnt mean better.
    Mega Heracross with multi hit moves was dope af though
"I once saw him KO 3 trainers in a gym..."

"With a Bellsprout, I've heard this story."

"With a fuc-king Bellsprout! Who the fuck can do that??"
    I love this
Trapinch
    Oh nos.
Freshly hatched gogglings
yes
Magnezone with zap cannon was sooo cool in the games. I didn‚Äôt care that it rarely hit, I spammed it and it was worth it every time.
I still am not sure if I like magnezone after more than a decade. Part of it is it just looks so much slower than magneton. I just picture the animations from Pokemon Colosseum where the magnemites in magneton are zipping around as they attack, and then think about how Magnezone's animations look and it just feels so much blander.
Gogoat? It was the first you could actually ride around on. But everyone forgets poor Gogoat ‚òπÔ∏è
