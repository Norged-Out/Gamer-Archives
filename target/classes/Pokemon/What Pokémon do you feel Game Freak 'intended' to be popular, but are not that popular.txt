[[What Pok√©mon do you feel Game Freak 'intended' to be popular, but are not that popular]]


Inspired by a comment by u/Waffletimewarp about Milotic, particularly on how it feels like Milotic was supposed to be a super popular Pok√©mon with a lot of emphasis put on it in earlier games to 'balance out' the fact that it was rare, but is there any Pok√©mon that feels like Game Freak made a push for it to be popular, but it just never seemed to take off as well as the likes of Lucario, Greninja, Snom, Tinkaton, etc.

One I feel like is a contender is the Haxorus line. It was revealed in pre release information prior to B/W's release, and Axew was Iris's companion in the anime. To add to this, both Iris and Drayden use one as their ace in B/W and B2/W2. Not only that, but there was a shiny one as a 100% completion reward, the only other guaranteed shinies in those games being the already popular Dratini and Gible. In fact, more than *half* of Dragon specialists in the series have had a team with a Haxorus on it, these being Lance (B2W2), Drake (ORAS), Drayden (BW, B2W2), Iris (BW, B2W2), Hassel (SV) and Drayton (SV). Sadly, it doesn't feel like Haxorus is anywhere near as popular as Dragonite, Salamence, Garchomp, Dragapult or even Flygon for that matter (Which TBH is a shame because I actually like Haxorus)


poliwhirl. it is featured heavily in gen 1's marketing. it is also one of the mascot for the pokemon center, but is later replaced. which is sad, because poliwhirl is satoshi tajiri's favourite so they clearly hope that fans like it too.
    The missed the boat by not including Poliwrath in the Elite 4. If Bruno had Poliwrath and PrimeApe instead of two non-fighting, weak Onix, everyone would come out ahead. 

Bruno would be taken more seriously. 

Poliwrath would get some more clout. 

Onix would even get more clout because as it is, its stats are a joke by that point in the game. Leave it as the first "boss" and at least it might still -seem- intimidating.
        I never understood that. It's not a Lance situation where there just aren't anymore dragons so you have to use dragon-looking Pokemon. There's literally 2 more fully evolved fighting types to use.
            i think their idea was for each one to use one non-specialization typed pokemon, but even then there are better choices
                like coulve used golem, instead of atleast 1 of the onix.

Since rhydon was for giovanni adn your rival
                    not to mention it‚Äôs even worse cuz he uses two of them‚Äîreplace one with poliwrath or primeape, and it‚Äôd still be much better than its actual form

hell, even if we want to go beyond rock types or the golem option, electabuzz strikes me as on-theme based on its significant arms. Pinsir, Kangaskhan, Exsecutor

if we‚Äôre keeping it open to pokemon other trainers use, both nidos and rhydon would also be good
                        >Pinsir, Kangaskhan, Exsecutor

Pinsir and Kangaskhan are cool suggestions, but I can't wrap my head around how you came up with giving Bruno an Exeggutor.
                        The Elite 4 should have been considered dual type specialists from the start. Lorelei would have officially been ice/water, Bruno as fighting/rock, Agatha as ghost/poison, and Lance as dragon/flying. It would have helped them stand out from the gym leaders who stick to one type, and since Lance would no longer be coy with half of his team being flying types, we couldn‚Äôt rag on him for being a ‚Äúdragon‚Äù trainer.
                Young me assumed that the Onixes were to counter your beefed-out Pidgeot that you'd had since early game.
            Because the E4 is fodder for you to train for the Champion. Also, the mons you face are reminiscent of bosses in order to evoke past fights. That's why Lorelei is so similar to Misty (redhead trainer with water mons), Bruno to Brock (shirtless fighter with messy hair and Onix) and Agatha to Team Rocket ("evil" lady with Golbat, Arbok and Haunter line).
            [deleted]
                I mean you'd have a point if the "wildcard" pokemon were actually strong pokemon. But practically every run I've seen (and I've been watching a LOT of Red and Blue runs lately, shoutout to JROSE11) the Onixes are always one-shots. Hell, plenty of times he sets up stat-boosts against them because they're so weak they don't pose a threat. 

MAYBE you could say Poliwrath would be beaten by whatever Grass or Electric type you used to sweep Lorelei, but Grass will still sweep Onix. If you want Electric coverage, than sub one for a Golem. Maybe a Marowak.
        Funny enough that ends up being Chuck's team in Gen2
            Then Chuck could have used Heracross and/or Hitmontop.
        But he obviously uses the Onixes to counter Flying-types!
            He might wanna invest in literally any other rock or electric type Pok√©mon
                Victory road is all the way over there though
        Bit of a crime that Bruno doesn't have Poliwrath or Primeape. 

I've always been curious behind the choices for gym leaders and the E4 in Gen 1 & 2. Some of them just don't make any sense.
        Polywrath is my favorite Pok√©mon still!
        Wait. Bruno was a fighting type specialist? I thought he was rock. Basically, an older shirtless relative of Brock.
        [deleted]
        What's even weirder is that Poliwrath is one of I think 3 pokemon that do not appear at all in red/blue so you literally never see the sprite during a playthrough unless you yourself catch one (or battle a friend that has one). That type of exclusion is really weird to me.
    Also Poliwrath line is Red's starter in the manga.
        I remember reading the manga first time during my childhood. Red‚Äôs first mons were poliwhirl, bulbasaur and pikachu.
        The manga is the best pokemon media that exists CMV. They do the world such justice. The battles were fun and creative, the characters were fun and interesting, and the gyms were cooler.

Also the creator said its the closest depiction of pokemon to the world he imagined than any game movie or show
            Just recently discovered the manga myself, been a fan of pokemon since ‚Äò98. Hard agree on the quality, the pokemon moves are so much squishier in terms of versatility.
            What‚Äôs cmv?
                "Change my view"
            I love the Pok√©mon manga but the hardest part of it is that the manga in recent years have suffered due to the breakneck pack of the games‚Äô release. The manga has to keep up with the constant releases now and that has led to the last few arcs being incredibly rushed and less character and Pok√©mon development
        That‚Äôs interesting, I forgot this. I guess it‚Äôs because Poliwhirl is apparently Satoshi Taijiri‚Äôs favorite Pok√©mon (hence its heavy appearances in Gen 1 stuff.)
    I was thinking about how it was odd and random that my first email address as a kid, in like 2000, involved Poliwhirl. Then I saw some of the marketing/promotional material from that time period and it makes way more sense. Poliwhirl was everywhere during that period and then sort of fell off into irrelevance with gen 2.
        he did get a neat evo in gen 2, but trade evos in general are a pain if you're playing by yourself
            Yeah having a trade evo as your favorite sucks
            Which always sucked cause Gengar has always been my favorite from the start.
    Has a huge role in the early manga. He‚Äôs Red‚Äôs ace over Pikachu even.
    The Poly line is still one of my favorites of any gen. Polywag is just too adorable. Definitely a top 5/10 line and first evo for me
        I remember having a poliwhirl plushie like 25 years ago lol. Thing was nice af
    Poliwhirl is one of my favorites at least. Back during Pokemania just as the first movie was coming out, Burger King had all these Pok√©mon toys for kids meals. I was so excited to open up a Pokeball and get a Poliwhirl plush.
    Still one of my favourites because I got a doll of it when I was young and it just looks cool
    Poliwhirl is the GOAT wdym
    I had a poliwhirl birthday cake when I was a kid which my mum made for me so the fact it‚Äôs recognised by people who know nothing about Pok√©mon says something. Wish it was the same level as Charzard
    Hell yeah on poliwhirl, i remember as a kid getting a bunch of gen 1 pokemon stickers with the old art style after doctors‚Äô visits and among the more recognizable genwunners like koffing, diglett, venonat, magnemite, beedrill, jigglypuff, there was poliwag, not exactly poliwhirl but it‚Äôs the same evolution line, it‚Äôs near and dear to me for this reason
    I remember thinking that was weird as hell even as a kid *during* Gen 1. Like, "why is Poliwhirl everywhere? It's not cute or tough looking."
    Yesss! I love my Poliwhirl tape measure ü•π
    Definitely worked on me, Poliwhirl and by extension Politoed, are two of my favorite pok√©mon
    Poliwag and POliwhirl *are* some of my faves though! I don't as much like poliwrath unfortunately.
    I believe Poliwhirl was also supposed to be the poster child for the concept of evolution.  In the same way that bugs were the concept for catching little monsters in the first place, creatures like tadpoles that mature into frogs and caterpillars that become butterflies were the basis for Pok√©mon evolution
Not that it isn't popular, but it's long been known that Clefairy was originally set to be the series mascot before that decided on Pikachu
    Clefairy being designed as the series mascot is the reason why in-game pokemon dolls are clefairies.
        Oh, cool! That makes so much sense!
    It's pretty sad for clefairy as i remember back in the 90's it was everywhere with a ton of merch and it kinda was the second mascot after pikachu. Then it got forgotten after gen ii came out.

Clefairy was still one of my first favorite pokemon so i still love him. ‚ù§
        what‚Äôs crazy is that the second mascot of pokemon is still from gen 1 but it‚Äôs eevee instead of clefairy lol
            Plus Jigglypuff totally overshadowed it in popularity thanks to its role in the anime.  Clefairy really lost out.

On the other hand Clefable is an actually good Pok√©mon game wise and Wigglytuff is pretty terrible so I suppose it's balanced itself in some ways.
                Jigglypuff also got the Smash Bros popularity bump too.
                    that‚Äôs bcs of the anime popularity buff tho tbf
                        It definitely could have influenced it a little bit, but from my understanding Sakurai really loved Kirby and wanted a second fighter with a similar model.
                            >Sakurai really loved Kirby

of course, Kirby is Sakurai's creation
                Clefairy actually is more viable than Clefable in the officially competitive format which is neat!
            Let's Go Clefairy would had been awesome ngl.
                But instead of getting it from Professor Oak you had to go to Mount Moon to get your starter. Which kind of resembles a lot of characters from the anime, like Iris and Axew.
            For me, Eevee isn't my favorite pokemon, but when you include its evolutionary line it feels like the most pokemon of any pokemon.
    Tbf, pink isn‚Äôt a ¬´¬†gender neutral¬†¬ª color, unlike yellow that is. Pink isn‚Äôt usually adored by small boys (¬´¬†ew girls¬†¬ª). On top of that, yellow isn‚Äôt a very common color in mascots, making it easier for Pikachu to be recognised. The only other big mascot at the time was Winnie The Pooh.

In overall, switching to Pikachu was quite a good choice
        As a kid, I saw Yellow and Pink as equally "feminine" colours because of the original Power Rangers. I still remember how odd I though it was when I saw the first male "Yellow Ranger"
            Yellow Ranger was masculine in the series that Saban spliced to make Mighty Morphin‚Äô. You‚Äôll notice only Pink‚Äôs suit has the little skirt.
        All colors are gender neutral if you‚Äôre not a little b@&$h about it.
        The Simpsons?
    Yeah it has a manga where it's the main character. The talking Pokemon one.
    I imagine having Clefairy as the mascot would lead to tough fights in the anime being won due to Metronome pulling out the right move to use.
    I know it's not mass market but clefable and the entire clefairy line at least got more  recognition from the competitive community once it got fairy typing. Oh boy fairy type, good move pool letting it run 8+ builds and magic guard/unaware made it the best Pok√©mon of gen 6 in singles (Smogon) and among the top in gen 7 and 8. Pretty good for rejected mascot. 

If nothing else it's my favourite. My bold T-waving calm minding monster still gives my mates nightmares.
Furfrou and the Gogoat line were clearly intended to be way more popular than they wound up. Gogoat and Skiddo in particular were REALLY pushed by marketing.

"You get to ride this new pokemon around the map, and its evolution will take you around the region's major city!"

...but Skiddo can only be ridden in one part of a route and, even if you do manage to find its station in Lumiose, Gogoat can't be controlled.

"Look at this dapper little doggo, it gets so many new forms!"

...that do effectively nothing and will be largely unavailable until well after you've realized this is another 'mediocre with okay-ish speed' normal-type.

At least Gogoat and Skiddo got to come back in gens 8 and 9. Furfrou's just been collecting dust in the toybox.
    There are now only 7 Pok√©mon that cannot be transferred to any Switch games.

Six of them are the Gen V elemental monkeys and their evolutions.

The seventh is Furfrou.

Edit: I've been informed that I missed a few.
        There are a few other pokemon still trapped in home jail.

Patrat and Watchog

Alolan Form Rattata and Raticate (In the Let's Go games but a Alolan Rattata transferred from Bank isn't transferable to Let's Go)

Spinda (In BDSP but for some reason BDSP Spinda can't be transfered to home. Likewise Spinda transferred from bank can't be transferred to BDSP)
            Apparently the reason why spinda isn‚Äôt transferable is because the coding used for its spots were all done backwards. So it‚Äôs just straight up incompatible with home. Hope you didn‚Äôt get a shiny one
                It's not that Spinda is incompatible with HOME, but that Spinda from outside games are incompatible with BDSP and Spinda from BDSP... well, they can't go anywhere anyway. So you can bring a Spinda up into HOME, but then it's stuck there until Game Freak puts it in another game.

I honestly find it to be a profoundly offensive oversight that this bug has not been fixed. I personally don't care about Spinda at all, but every Pok√©mon is somebody's favorite and I feel terrible for anyone who might have transferred a Spinda to HOME from Gen VII who now cannot play with their beloved Pok√©mon. To me, that goes against the entire spirit of Pok√©mon.

I have a similar rant about Dexit, but it's basically the same point except longer so I won't bore anyone by going into that.
                It was transferrable at some point, because I got a pile in my home boxes. Trapped , I assume.
    And then Gogoat inexplicably makes it onto Geeta's team. Also there was a meme that Gamefreak forgot about that line for a while. It was also the last regular Gen 6 Pokemon added to Go.
    Im kinda mad tauros got the water/fire versions this game 

Imagine skiddo/gogoats but of different elements 

Give me all the goats
        Tauros got forms because bulls are a big thing in Spain.
            I understand fully and dont think it is wrong. 

I just want Ele-goats and am petty-mad because Gogoat is my top 5 favs
    I'd argue that Furfrou wasn't supposed to be a popular Pokemon, at least outside of Kalos. It was clearly just supposed to represent the Frenchness of XY.  It's a poodle!  And you can dress it up!  So fancy, so French!  It's the same reason why trainer clothes were initially introduced.
I know everyone's saying Zoroark, but I gotta chip anyway just to comment how sad it is.

It went from starring in its own movie, being event exclusive (which is dumb, but besides the point), then being gift exclusive in B2W2, available very late game in XY, then made available pretty much right away in USUM.

Riolu has also been available super early at times, but it's funny how Zoroark's availability comes off like a constant downward spiral.
    Zoroark not being normally available in BW is a big part of why it didn‚Äôt remain popular, imo.  If I can‚Äôt use it, how am I gonna learn to love it?
        I have to wonder, parts of Zoroark make me think they intended for it to be a playground rumor. This Pokemon you can't get, but has a surprise reveal during N's final battle, and the mysterious Lostlorn Forest with no apparent purpose? The Zorua you read about in Castelia, but can't find anywhere? That screams playground rumor material.

But then on the other hand, they gave it a whole damn movie, tons of exposure, and a huge amount of attention in the shiny beasts event *long* before BW released.

They tried to recreate Lucario *and* Mew at the same time, when both were successful for different, opposing reasons.
            Locario and the Mystery of Mew you say?
                No, Lucario and mew. The Pokemons. The first one was HEAVILY featured both in the games and in the promotional material pre release of the games. You can see Lucario in a gym leader's team in DPP, In the champion's team in DPP and in the team of a beloved npc during his quest line. It was featured heavily in the anime, in the movies, and it's easily available as an egg halfway through the game. Lucario is effectively a mascot of gen 4, it's easily available but also very special and unique.

On the other hand mew was only featured in one movie during gen 1's lifespan. It's almost never mentioned in the game, featured only in descriptions, and normally it's not obtainable without a proper event or distribution, which incidentally happened only in Japan during the release of its own movie. It's eeriness, the not knowing whether it really existed or not, spawned a ton of playground theories. The mystique around it was part of its popularity.

It seems that they wanted to make a pokemon that was mysterious and elusive to obtain enough to create legends and theories about itself at the playgrounds, but that at the same time was at the forefront of that franchise, being basically everywhere in anime, movies and all promotional material. If you know that something REALLY EXISTS and what it can do, then it has no mystery left to reveal. 

Arceus is so beloved by the franchise because it was treated Like mew, something so legendary and elusive that it has an aura of mystery. It's barely mentioned in the games, impossible to obtain without an event that was never distributed, and only officially revealed with its own movie.
                    Arceus is an example of Game Freak REALLY getting a Pok√©mon right. The Sinjoh Ruins event in HGSS is one of the weirdest and most memorable events in any Pok√©mon game. PLA also did a fantastic job making Arceus feel like... well, Arceus. If only every mythical could be so realized.
        Riolu on the other hand was made available halfway through the game as a gift egg at iron island, with a very fun quest line associated with it. It makes you want to get it after seeing it being featured heavily in the teams of some of the coolest trainers in the game
        Sneasel syndrome.

\- Appears ultra late in Gen2 and 4, but also can't evolve in Gen 4 despite having unevolved stat line.
        Yep. I remember, I saw the movie on Cartoon Network and thought "gee, that's a cool Pok√©mon. Can't wait to get one in the new game." Then, while playing the game, I found out that you can't actually get one in the game. Then years later, I found out that it was connected to an event that I had no idea even happened when it did.
    I think Zoroark is popular enough to not be discussed here.

Like, sure, it never got as popular as the top tier mons like Lucario, Charizard, Pikachu, Eevee, and Greninja - but it‚Äôs up there. As popular as many mythicals that received movies and event status.

Especially with its Hisuian form it got way more popular.

I think it‚Äôs Hisuian form having an exclusive typing is the one thing the original was lacking that really makes it great. If it had had that from the beginning it would have been even more popular.

I don‚Äôt think availability has anything to do with it because, as mentioned, Riolu is just has easily available these days.
    I honestly expected it to be a fighter in Smash 4 but it sadly missed the window since XY came out.
    "Event" (i.e. enter a digital code) Pokemon is the stupidest idea Gamefreak ever had, imo.
        It's a great tool for keeping people's attention, not so great for the actual players themselves.
    I feel like zoroark and lucario getting their own movies shows that they were designed to be pseudos (or at least pseudo-pseudo) leading to, at least zoroarks, rarity. This could also work (albeit less) for pokemon like milotic also being mentioned here a lot. 

I almost feel like it opens up the possibility for another level of rarity after mythical, legendary, pseudo, then ________. 

This new category containing those pokemon falling short of the pseudo title but still maintaining an air of superiority over your more commonplace pokemon for either rarity, power, or even simply detail into the lore and history of the pokemon. Most of the pokemon discussed in this thread could probably fall under this category honestly for various reasons.

Examples including again zoroark, lucario, both non-legendaries with there own movies, and milotic for its rarity, but also possibly home to pokemon like arcanine who was originally designed be at least connected to the legendary bird trio or even gyarados who (at least in the anime and pokedex entries) is described as a monstrous beast of the sea deeply feared by sailors. Even the clefairy line with being so tanky and only found in mount moon with an entire lore around them could also fall into this list. 

Basically a lot of the pokemon in this thread come together to create this idea of the pseudo-pseudos that were hoped for popularity and wrestling either overshadowed or feel short, or meant to feel like playground rumor
        Pseudos with rarity of legendaries are weird. Paradox Pokemon would be legendary post Gen 9 as we would have no way of obtaining them after SV era ends. Ultra Beasts are in the same spots, but is treated as a legendary rightfully.
    Zeraora was also probably meant to fill the same role
        I mean, Zeraora just kind of...exists. The most it got was a role in a movie, but even that got overshadowed by everything else in it.
Zarude

literally who remembers that thing
    Zarude - Zandstorm
        Everytime I see it or it's name this is what I think followed by the song playing on loop in my head
        "Zarude is buffeted by the Zandstorm!"
    A lot of recent mythics feel like that. A random event, "oh neat" then in the box it goes, never to be touched again.
Hopefully Pecharunt has a cool story at least.
        Yeah getting mythicals from random code distributions makes them very uneventful.
            Also them not having an event in-game is pretty boring.

Think back to Gen 3, 4 and 5 (for victini at least) where you generally got an item and had to go somewhere in the world to obtain the pokemon.

That made the encounter much more special than "Insert code, receive mon, maybe get a conversation, like with Diancie"
                Even most if not all of the other Unova mythicals had *something* for them.  Keldeo had the little clearing to get Resolute Form.  Meloetta had the guy in Castelia who would play the relic song.  Even Genesect at least had the scientist who would give the different drives.
                    Meloetta also had an [event](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok√©mon_Global_Link_promotions#Musical_shows) related for Pok√©mon Musical feature although its separate from getting the mythical. 

This obscure event is the only time that a Mythical is implied to be owned by a trainer in the main series game outside of the protagonist.
                Spoilers for Indigo Disk DLC:

>!I LOVE THE MELOETTA ENCOUNTER FOR THIS EXACT REASON! It's such an insanely complex and nonsensical way to encounter a Pok√©mon, but the result is a genuinely exciting encounter that had me cackling like a child even though I looked up a guide to get it. My ONE complaint about this encounter is that I really don't think you can figure it out on your own. SV does not really encourage you to talk to random NPCs, so you'll probably never get the hints. And even if you do, they don't spell things out super clearly, so I think it's unlikely anyone will organically encounter Meloetta without the internet telling them she's out there. But man, what an amazing moment that would be. I wish all Mythicals were obtained like this.!<
            Heck if you‚Äôre going to gift them at least distribute them at lvl 10 or 20 so we can actually use them for a playthrough. Lvl 100 just ensures they‚Äôre never getting used
                The level 5 event Pokemon they briefly did were fucking rad. ORAS had a shiny Beldum with hold back (which is false swipe with a different name) so he was strong and good for catching. S&M followed that up with a munchlax with hold back, happy hour, metronome, and a Snorlax z-crystal. Z-Metronoming my way through the game was a blast.

More alt starters and less unique Pokemon with no substance pls, gamefreak.
            This is why I like the Meloetta event in the indigo disc

You spin around like the peroette form , then use the sepia filter as a reference to the og black and white event where the guy talks about his sepia colored dreams , feels very gen 3 esque imo
            The game won't even let you nickname them to make them feel personalized.
        Pecharunt is already more memorable for me just due to the sheer amount of theorizing people have done for it from the teal mask
        People have complained that a lot of recent mythicals‚Äô issues have been because there‚Äôs not much you have to do *in game* to get them - like, you don‚Äôt get to travel to a new area or anything, there‚Äôs just someone standing in the pokemon center to give them to you.

With that in mind, I wish that they would just change the modern idea of mythicals altogether, so that the DLC legendaries would be considered mythicals. It‚Äôs still technically content that isn‚Äôt accessible in the base game, that you have to download, so it *kinda* counts. It‚Äôs better than just adding some Pok√©mon you get with a code that no one will remember.
        Honestly this is why I feel like gen 5 were the last very memorable legendaries/mythics. It's because you can remember the events and cutscenes. I was so pissed when Diancie didnt get a special quest involving the sundial or the crystal cave.
        Most Mythics are like that in general, tbh. Download event ticket, go to a one-off map that's never going to get used again, fight and catch it like any other 'mon, and let it rot in the box. Maybe sprinkle in a line or two of dialogue if an NPC is involved.
        Mythics in the first five generations(except gen iii, jirachi and deoxys were very random, but the deoxys situation was somewhat fixed in the remakes) were linked to the lore in the region. After that, they just became dull.
    There was a movie for it and everything but I think Zarude suffered from both the fact that primate Pok√©mon seem to get a mixed reception anyway and there‚Äôs already a grass primate as one of the starters in its own generation.
        There's also the fact that the movie plays against it's rarity and mythic status, by featuring a whole tribe of Zarudes
            I think it's somewhat plausible.

It is not rare in the sense that there are just very few specimen of it, but because they live so deep in the jungle that most humans will probably never encounter them in their entire life.
        And man, until you said this, I was getting Zarude mixed up with the electric anthro-cat mythical.
    Zarudes problem was that it literally just doesn‚Äôt look mythical. It looks like a 3rd gen evo of a grass monkey.

Idk if that makes sense, but when I think of mythical Pok√©mon I think of either:

- cute/small/powerful like mew/jirachi/celebi/manaphy/shaymin/victini/marshadow

- or big/cool/edgy/unique like mewtwo/darkrai/crescelia/heatran/etc.

Zarude seems like he wants to be in the second category, but a mojo-jojo lookalike just doesn‚Äôt have that unique of a niche in that crowd.
        Now I can‚Äôt unsee Zarude as just an alternate timeline final evo of Grookey lol it def has that vibe
        it doesnt help that there is literally already a grass monkey in the very same game/generation, *and* its a starter w a similar colour scheme. its just kind of a weird choice.
        You named 3 non-mythicals. Heatran isn't mythical and I suspect you meant volcanion. Crescelia isn't mythical, maybe you were thinking of Genesect(?).

Mewtwo isn't mythical either.

The most important large mythical is Arceus.
        Lore wise, Zarude doesn‚Äôt seem mythical at all either. It‚Äôs been confirmed that multiple Zarude exist, so it‚Äôs not some one of a kind Pok√©mon like Mew, Celebi, Jirachi, etc. 

And it has the power of healing plants and forests, but that‚Äôs nothing new in the Pok√©mon world - even Meganium can heal plants back to life.
    Genuinely not even sure what this is. I'll have to google it after this comment, lol.
    I only remember how much of a shitshow that one distribution was. People weren‚Äôt getting their emails and then after a while support stopped giving out codes to people because they ‚Äúran out.‚Äù
    Okay, but the Zarude movie was banging.
    Mythicals are in a terrible spot. You can't use them in VGC, or battle tower (when it actually exists), and their release is ass. Most people will have already become champion, or its level is too high for their current progress. The only thing truely special about them is their rarity.
    Same with Zeraora‚Ä¶ no one remembers that thing.
    So many mythical tbh. Diancie, Magearna, Zeraora‚Ä¶
Poliwhirl was my life! #SatoshiTajiriFavorite"

I share the sentiment about Poliwhirl being a favorite and feel sad that it wasn't as popular as intended.
    My brother loved that Pok√©mon! It was all over the Pok√©mon bed sheets and in merch back in the 90‚Äôs
I know everyone says Zoroark, but I think Victini was also up there, especially with how much it was promoted when BW released and being the 1st pokemon in the BW pokedex for some reason.
    It definitely got a lot of attention for being 000 *and* being really useable in the story if the Liberty Pass was obtained.

But then the first one turned into footnotes for wiki pages once the new factor wore off, while nothing was ever done with it again outside the movies, which every mythical was getting.

EDIT: Unova was not the first generation with four mythicals. Forgot about Manaphy.
    > BW released and being the 1st pokemon in the BW pokedex for some reason.

Okay so the reason it was #000 was purely a mechanical reason. You got it *really* early on in the game. Since your Pokedex in Gen 5 goes as far as the furthest seen and/or caught Pokemon is, if it were at the *end* of the Unovan dex, the moment you caught it you'd like all of the Regional Unova dex pages unlocked and just showing ??? and that would be a huge hassle. So they made it #000 and decided to make a big deal out of it.
    I actually got Victini, and while it was cool to have him at the start of my playthrough...idk, he just didn't really click.
    Black and white kinda killed the idea of fun mythicals. Everyone sites the fact that you just kinda get the mythicals now but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the only part. I think the biggest part was how they gave you just a little taste of information in the base game to start rumors like the new journals in RBY or the kid having nightmares in Canalave city or the books talking about the origin of Pok√©mon in the libraries in DPPT. They also used to thematically fit in with the region, like kanto has a lot of themes of man vs nature so mew as a counterpart to mewtwo fits the region, Johto has a theme of purity and tradition so celebi fits there, Hoenn has the space station and the mythicals are from space, sinnoh has themes of origin mythology and pantheons so all the mythicals are gods of certain aspects of the world, then Unova started the theme of mythicals just being rare Pok√©mon, like meloetta could be from any region, Victini is just the victory Pok√©mon numbered 0 no one in the game talks about it, there‚Äôs no explanation why it‚Äôs #0, no extra events for catching it, it doesn‚Äôt really fit in with the rest of gen V, and every mythical after that has the same problem, like what makes Magearna so special? Think about how much you could say about Arceus vs something like Zarude or Zeraora.
Zoroark. They tried to make it Gen V's Lucario but failed.
    To be fair that was just massive self sabotage considering how stupid the method to get one is in BW1, and the fact that the only way to get one in BW2 is N's Zorua.
        Now that you mention it, I do remember when I was playing, I really did want one but was massively disappointed when there was no way to catch a Zorua. Now I don't think of Zoroark at all.
            Exactly - it wasn‚Äôt able to be obtained despite my looking for it and wanting to catch it. It wasn‚Äôt findable so it couldn‚Äôt be ‚Äúpart of the team‚Äù and get good memories
                They fixed that by having it on Route 1 in Ultra Sun/Moon with a 30% encounter rate in this one patch of grass. That was my second main line Pok√©mon game, and I had a Zorua on my team and fell in love with it.
        Needing to transfer either an event Celebi from HGSS for Zorua, or an event shiny Johto Beast from DPPt for Zoroark, is an infuriatingly idiotic requirement for getting Pok√©mon featured in a *movie*
        make it a free gift egg in BW1 and easy profit
            Worked for Volcarona, that seems fairly popular (obviously not to the levels of Lucario, Charizard and Greninja).
                But Volcarona only worked once. Now you have to get a Larvesta and level it up like insane to get a Volcarona.
                    I like to call that Gen 5 syndrome. (Seriously, level 59 for volcarona and 64 for hydreigon??)
                    Volcarona can be obtained at level 35 in the mid game in BW2 but that‚Äôs an exception.
            They already did it first with Riolu in gen 4, why they didn't try it again in gen 5?
                Heck, they give you a free Mega Lucario in gen 6
                    It's funny how both XY and ORAS just gives you a free mega relatively early on

Yes I'm sure giving me a mega evolution when 90% of the game involves fights with mega-less trainers is a good idea lmao
            They did this actually...in japan...I had a Japanese copy of white and was able to grab and raise it in game and then breed it and send an egg to an English copy of black once that came out!
                Thing is, a lot of people dont live in japan, thus not having access to japenese events, especially the kids that lived outside of japan. 
This is my biggest gripe with gamefreak, they run a bunch of really cool events within japan, shiny this, mythical that, and then just ignore the rest of the world when theres a decent playerbase everwhere else
        bw1 is especially bad for this like u can‚Äôt catch fuckall until like 3 gyms in then u still gotta wait until like the e4 or post game to get a heap of mons cos they‚Äôre either rlly late game or they level up so late there‚Äôs no point
            [deleted]
                yeah rufflet or vullaby evolving around 50 is pretty bad in bw when get them after like 7th gym in mid to high 30's, but its far worse when find them early game in later games
                The real problem is that they actually had a good level curve and wanted you to have some time with the base versions before they evolve, at least for the birds and Deino, Larveresta has no excuse, they probably should have just been available to find earlier into the region, like do something like open up Marvelous Bridge but keep the version city closed around Driftveil and make them available there
        Same thing for Milotic. It's still quite popular, because it's a beautiful pokemon indeed, but the fact that very few players got it, specially before beating the Elite4, must have hindered its popularity a lot
            I think this is part of why I love Milotic so much. I was that kid who spent eight hours straight hunting for a Feebas and then had a Milotic on my team during the story play. It made me a legend amongst my friends and Pok√©mon-playing peers, especially since I bred her and had multiple Milotic (and traded some Feebas for legendaries). I still have that first Milotic and she's still in Sapphire. :)
            ORAS did it right giving Feebas a fixed tile to find it
        Not to mention battle preview ruin any chance of him being viable outside of playthrough.
            Would disagree a bit with this point. Especially since the introduction of H-Zoroark into VGC. Although, I do wish there was no preview that would also mean an enormous uptick in Zoroark usage 

And it actually messes with ppls head (or not at all) when they see H-Zoroark in preview. I‚Äôll elaborate - players either do 1 or 2 things when they see Zoroark in my party 

1) Completely ignore or forget Zoroark was in my party which allows Zoroark additional turn(s) to either support or setup 

2) Over prepare or over analyze. (This involves switching a mon out or using a dark move when it would normally be ‚Äúnot very effective‚Äù)

Scenario #1 is far more common. Ppl very often just ignore or forget about Zoroark and still use fake out, close combat, drain punch, shadow ball (any normal, fighting, ghost type moves). Which ofc, H-Zoroark is immune to. 

H-Zoroark biggest strength in my party is still the element of surprise mostly bc ppl just don‚Äôt see him as a threat or get too caught up in several other strategies that are possible with my team and far more common in the VGC (and I do sometimes still use those strategies)

I‚Äôve never took a shot at regional or anything but every season I would make into a decent standing in Master Rank and always have an over .500 record. Certainly not in the top 100 every season but I‚Äôve gotten close and would say I‚Äôm at least capable
                Zoroark isn‚Äôt really a thing in vgc except for meme teams tbh. Even with illusion, it‚Äôs just not that good. You can def have fun with it on ladder and probably take it to some locals, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ever had any decent placements at higher level events. 

The meta is so hyper offensive that even resisted and neutral hits are removing it from the field.
        I think of Hisuian Zoroark before I do normal Zoroark to be honest. Zorua and Zoroark were cool for like 5 minutes back when Black/White launched, then we found out it couldn't be obtained outside a one off event and everybody just lost all interest.

Things like that are large part of why I hate that time limited events with exclusive pokemon are still a thing, anyone that misses the event is just screwed forever unless the event repeats at some point, and even then they can still be screwed if said event is in the next gen.
            Me when I missed Iron Leaves and Walking Wake with no promise of getting them again:
                Bruh theyre in tera raids rn.
    In BW it was held back that you need a Celebi or shiny Legendary Beasts released to tie in with the Zoroark movie. Even more so the way to bring them over to trigger the event flag was quite obscure (it involves the Relocator, the Pokemon Transfer Lab does not work to activate the event).
    Its so stupid they made it event-locked which made most people think its a mythical instead of making it obtainable during playthrough. I hope the eventual remakes should make it free from event-locked

Also I wish it should've have mega instead of stupid Audino but it got its Hisuian form and megas are no longer around, so it doesn't matter anymore.
    I feel like Zoroark is pretty popular tho. It‚Äôs my second favorite Pok√©mon
        Yeah. In the 2020 poll it came 23rd. While obviously not as good as Lucario being in 2nd, I would find it  hard to call any Pokemon in the top 50 not very popular Pokemon
        It's popularity has definitely risen in the past decade since it's debut, but it'll never reach the levels of Lucario, whose my second favorite Pokemon.
    It could of been gen 5s Lucario if they didn't lock it behind events in BW so we could use it on our team
    I like Zoroark. One of my favorite Pokemon designs/ concepts. But honestly it's pretty terrible. It's built purely as a sweeper. Which is great, but because it's so frail, it's ability is borderline useless. It's pretty much perpetually at 1 or 2 hits from being KOed. 

The Hisuian one improves slightly by having a more defensive typing, but is still frail.
    When it was introduced, the way it had a movie about it... I genuinely thought it was intended as a legendary or at least a mythical.
    I always found that, namewise, Liepard would've been better for having those kinds of powers. I mean it's a pok√©mon that's lying about who they are.
Personal theory: Misty‚Äôs Horsea was supposed to be her mascot, but was abandoned for the wildly more popular Togepi instead.
    I always thought Psyduck was her mascot until Togepi came along
        I honestly remember Misty more for Psyduck (the comic relief that she would keep bringing out by accident but who was secretly very powerful), Togepi (the baby of the bunch), Staryu (her actual only competent Pok√©mon), and Goldeen (who was never useful except in the water) than I do her Horsea (as I cannot recall what Horsea's running gag was).
            Horsea was the small weak one that was actually smart. it got kidnapped once and used its Spitting ink to create a trail for the characters to follow if I remember correctly
                Pokemon was always a kids show, but reading this it's nice to remember how every Pokemon was unique, they all had their quarks, personality and attitude.
                Yep in the Eevolutions episode
            Staryu was the best. HYAH!
            You completely missed her Starmie which she typically reserved for utility rather than battle.  She had a powerful 'mon in her pocket most of the time though.
                I forgot she had both a Starmie AND a Staryu on her team.
            Starmie in the corner here thinking "fine guess I'll just leave then".

No but for real, it always seemed like her Staryu was stronger from what I remember, which is pretty weird
        Psyduck isn‚Äôt necessarily her mascot‚Ä¶ but it has gags, which kind of make it memorable. Like, it kind of reminds me of James‚Äô Victreebell, even when Weezing is his real mascot.
            I'd probably say Psyduck could be considered her mascot, at least up until Togepi arrives, due to it being so memorable for her. I suppose you could also argue it was her most powerful pokemon, it's just neither of them knew how to use that power at will. 

I always kind of saw Psyduck as a bit of a metaphor for Misty. Has a headache most of the time (both Psyduck and Ash gave Misty "headaches"), can have temper/rage outbursts, lives in the shadow of her more talented sisters (Psyduck and Misty's other pokemon), has untapped potential and strength and comes up clutch when needed and/or is least expected. I may have read too much into it all, but Psyduck seemed the perfect fit to me as her mascot or "pal" pokemon, with her ace, then, probably being Starmie.
            Downfall is that Psyduvk's gag became stale fast and overshadowed her other Pokemon.

Oh she's gonna send out Starmie? Wrong, Psyduck.

Oh no Psyduck is massively outmatched? Jokes on you every time the opponent will play into the gag of hitting it until the headache power activates.
        To be fair i remember all of her pokemon vividly
    Horsea is super underrated in terms of cuteness. That thing is adorable. 

I mainly think of Psyduck when I think of anime Misty.
    Horsea and Corsola had big deals made around them with Misty wanting them, then they proceed to do nothing and never appear so Psyduck can pop out instead.
    For some reason I think of her Staryu more than Togepi. Either way, both were more popular than Horsea.
Mr. Mime is probably the biggest example. It's well established by now that the Japanese don't have the same fear of clowns that the west does, and considering Mr. Mime is a Rare people that has shown up in the anime as Delia's signature mon, I have a feeling it was intended to be popular
    I feel like I‚Äôm the only person who always loved Mr. Mime as a kid
        Honestly he's kind of crazy in RBY. Abra doesn't require much investment to get to Kadabra and start destroying everything, but you can do even less work and trade for Mr. Mime to IMMEDIATELY destroy everything. The boosted EXP also helps him level faster and stay strong. Honestly a top-tier in-game Pok√©mon.
    >Dahlia‚Äôs signature mon 

Assuming you‚Äôre referring to Ash‚Äôs mom and not the Arcade Star, her name is spelled ‚ÄúDelia‚Äù.
All the 'but it's the Pikachu of this generation' mouse/rodent things. Like minun and pluse, pachirisu etc. Maybe it's just for the joke but they all feel so redundant.
    As a followup to this-

Marill was designed to be a followup to Pikachu, a cute easy to draw elemental mouse with a zigzag tail and a single evolution, featured all the early Johto promos. Marill is the \*real\* Pikaclone of gen 2 before the concept was solidified (and it makes more sense with Johto being supplementary to Kanto, while Hoenn was more a 'reboot' which solidified the formula back to RBY) and doesn't even get recognized as it
        For those who weren‚Äôt Pokefans before Gen 2‚Äôs release, there was so much Mythos out there about Marill, or ‚ÄúPikablu‚Äù as some called it.
            I remember those days. "Leaks" of PIKABLU and Ho-Oh. 

Looking for Mew under the truck for the umpteenth time. 

Watching ripped Japanese scenes of the Pokemon Mewtwo Movie.
                I remember the insane arguments about the weird looking Moltres in the anime lmao.
                    In my circles it was well accepted that the Pokemon missing from the dex in the first episode of the anime was in fact Missing it's Number, thus Ho Oh is forever Missingno to me
                The Mew Truck thing sounded plausible if not likely.

The actual way to force a Mew spawn with the RNG and things like Nugget Bridge sounded like absolute bullshit but actually worked by gaming the coding lol
                    I was convinced the keys in the game corner was connected to the truck to get mew as a kid. 


Now I know that the keys on a machine just means you went to crap and no one take my spot
                Ho-oh was in the first episode of the anime, too. They had years of plans already and probably just enjoyed watching Gen I squirm
            It would've been so cool if they kept doing differently typed Pikaclones instead of clogging up the electric type with the same mon every gen
                Especially since a bunch are single evos. I‚Äôd be okay if we had another couple fully evolved lines of electric rodent.
                    Like the Pawmi line, which is my favorite pika-clone in part because you can actually use them.
                        I'm meh on the design but it's a neat typing and a neat concept.

However, it's also the only one where I agree that the evolution stages look way too similar, but that could be made worse by its debut in Paldea where it's a lot easier to mix up smaller 'mons.
            the pikablu days were good days, so much excitement and hype!
            The pok√©gods...
            Even the trading cards for the first movie called it Pikablu. Also Snubull was Buru.
                That's probably worth a pretty penny now
        It will forever make me sad that instead of getting a creatively designed rodent of a different element each generation, we get repeated electric rodents that all look borderline identical.

It‚Äôs like when a movie is successful, and they focus on all the wrong parts for the sequel
            It‚Äôs probably *because* of Marill‚Äôs unpopularity that they returned to Electric.
        I wish they would have stuck with the elemental mouse concept for pikachu clones. The first few pikaclones are just electric mice with weird mechanics, and even when they started adding extra types you could still mostly count on electric as one of the types. 

I wish they had it where each gen gets it's own elemental mouse, kinda like eeveelutions. Would make the concept more interesting avd give the different pikaclones different niches
    I feel like morpeko was the biggest example though. Marnie uses it, it's got a signature move and ability, looks similar, has the hunger switch gimmick
        I still don't know what the hunger switch does for Morpeko
            Changes the type of its signature move. When its full belly its electric type and when its hungry its dark type
                Ohhh thank you! I wanted to use Morpeko in my team in sword at one point but the constant switch made the battles take too long. So I just switched it out. Never noticed type change on its move.
    Mimikyu is the exception mainly because it play hard into being that with its own story behind it.
        Mimikyu isn‚Äôt an exception because it‚Äôs not considered as an electric type Pikachu clone. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs interesting lol. Togedamaru is the one for Gen 7 instead.
        Alola also has Togedemaru
        Mimkyu is not a pikaclone.
    Do they? Gen 2 and 3's introduce machanics (breeding and double battles), Gen 4 and 5's Pachirisu and Emolga are perfectly popular. Gen 6's Dedenne shows off Fairy-type. Gen 7's definitely a miss if we dont include Mimikyu, and so's the next but at least Gen 8's Morpeko at least has a unique gimmick. And Gen 9's Pawmot is just a straight up normal Pokemon that is actually very well received by the community. Even Raichu, the black sheep of the family got an Alolan form that was super well liked. So whilst yeah theres some misses, overall Id say the electric rodents are actually good Pokemon and should stay something GameFreak does
        Yeah it's not how I meant it. More like, they should have been even more popular, be the mascot of each gen just like Pikachu have been. 
It's just how I feel about them anyway
    Nah, Pikaclones are great and I think they understand they will never be that popular.
    I personally like the pawmi line, because it doesn't really look like a pikachu clone...
    Some of them are really cool. Pawmot became one of my favorites when i played through SV
The elemental monkeys
    Is that why you think they‚Äôve been withholding them from us since the 3DS?
        Also because they're quite superfluous when every single game has Eevee in it.
            Eevee wasn‚Äôt available in Black and White, the monkeys‚Äô debut games.
                Which only aupports the notion that they monkeys were there to fill that gap, but since Eevee is in every game since BW, the monkeys are surplus to requirements.
    I like them quite a lot and am sad to not be able to ever use them.
Zoroark was meant to be the gen 5 Lucario
    Hisui-Zoroark made me love it in a way regular failed
    I feel like it worked, every single one of my friends was obsessed with Zorua and Zoroark when BW came out
    Shouldn't have made it stupidly rare in those games.
    I think Zoroark is very popular with TCG players. Zoroark was very dominant in the TCG for a very long time, Zoroark GX in particular. It worked with a plethora of different partners and strategies, however, not in an oppressive but rather in an enabling way, so most players have fond memories of it.
I feel like they thought porygon was going to have some popularity due to it occasionally appearing in promotional stuff and having special card releases like when Pok√©mon Stadium came out‚Ä¶ and then ‚ÄòElectric Soldier Porygon‚Äù happened where Pikachu did a thing and poor Porygon gets blamed for it
    \#PorygonDidNothingWrong
        It was Pikachu‚Äôs fault. Ban Pikachu.
    The history behind Porygon is cool. Satoshi Tajiri was told making a sprite game was a waste of time since 3D graphics were getting better and that no one would be interested in their game. So he designed a 3D polygon Pokemon in a 2D sprite to be tongue in cheek.
        Now they need to design a 2D Pok√©mon to be in a 3D game to come full circle
    It‚Äôs so annoying too because they gave it TWO more evolutions and they NEVER appear in ANYTHING! there‚Äôs zero mythos or lore outside of gathering some small context clues in DPPt that show porygon-Z was probably created by team Galactic.

Like they‚Äôre all such cool pokemon, I wish they got some exposure.
        I know right?!

I think Porygon would be great inside a Pok√©dex like Rotom

Or rotom and Porygon could make a great duo!

The Porygon line is so underutilized
    I've always thought it was odd that Rotom is in pokedexes instead of Porygon, it would make a lot more sense with porygon. Porygon is literally a digital pokemon, it can be a digital assistant. Rotom's an electric ghost, it can... power the phone? Power was never an issue to begin with in the games.

Come to think of it, in sword/shield and scarlet/violet, does the phone having a rotom even add anything? In sun and moon it was cool because the Rotom was it's own character, but past that they're... just there. With Porygon, it would make sense, a digital assistant is there to help, not be your friend, but rotom isn't a digital assistant, it's a ghost, it should have personality.
Yamper and Bolthound because normally the early game electric types like Luxray and Ampharos are popular Pokemon for playthough teams but Sword and Shield offers you a much cooler one to use being Toxtricity. Yamper in the Journeys anime gets replaced by Eevee getting done dirty
    Boltund in particular is a real interesting one because I think it's one of the few instances where a Dog Pok√©mon has just not been popular
        He should have been a bigger Yamper imo
            Exactly, I love yamper (I have a corgi IRL) but Bolthund is the most generic uninteresting dog Pok√©mon ever conceived
                I love Boltund personally (It's a dog so of course I will), but it's design is definitely just too generic dog to be more popular. Probably would've been smarter to just continue the corgi theme, especially since the breed is super popular nowadays (I had two when I was a kid).
                    Bolthund always felt like it was trying to invoke a greyhound, which makes me wonder if historically dog racing was a thing in the inspiring region from real world or the in game region.

Edit: or just general foxhounds which when I looked them up were so painfully generic they look like what I would put as the ‚Äúdog‚Äù picture in a dictionary‚Ä¶ /smh
                I went into Sword and Shield without knowing too much about the game so I was so excited to catch Yamper. And then I evolved it and I boxed it. I was heartbroken üòü I was expecting it to stay a corgi and I was so let down!
            yeah it should‚Äôve stayed a corgi or like evolved into a sheepdog looking dog instead also bolthund looks like weirdly bald idk not a fan of him as much as i love yamper
                Let's not forget the complete stat change on evolution either.  Yamper starts off with like, 29 base speed and then hits 121 on evolution.  You get this funny chonky corgi who seems like he'll be a bulky electric wall who ends up evolving into a completely separate dog breed that's a speed demon.

The juxtaposition between the two ideas is just jarring, especially on an animal that most people have a strong familiarity with.  We know dog breeds are distinct and different, and we saw a corgi then wanted a corgi.  But it evolves and essentially becomes a whole new concept unrelated to its base beyond "dog".

Yamper sucks because he's an example of one of the worst outcomes of evolution: becoming something so completely different or unexpected that the player gets disappointed since they liked the original idea.  It's not like Bug types either - we all know caterpillars become butterflies, so when Caterpie evolves we're already fully on board to see that drastic change.

No one was expecting that from not only a dog, but a dog breed that's so iconic to the region the game took inspiration from.
                    yeah like there‚Äôs lots of british dogs they could‚Äôve used but bolthund is like just generic dog it doesn‚Äôt seem like any breed particularly also maybe it‚Äôs in the dex or smth idk but yamper and its evo should‚Äôve had some sorta rivalry with wololo since corgis are sheepdogs and farm shit like that is pretty big in the uk also ur right it should‚Äôve kept bulky and used a shetland sheepdog as a base like it could‚Äôve used its fur to hold electricity and shock anyone that tried to attack (lore wise good excuse to give it high defence) i feel like dog mons get done kinda dirty like cat mons are usually really well designed

                        What are you talking about, Boltund's clearly a greyhound.
                        I love the idea of a Sheltie Yamper evo! It feels like a much more natural progression both in visuals and inspirations.
                Its because bolthund is a super hero and the fox thing was the villian. They both look idiotic because mascot concept look trumps generally interesting design.
                    ohhh that makes a little more sense i liked the fox a lot thought tbh it felt like an old school pokemon
                        Nicket is adorable. The second form looks dumb
    yamper and wooloo were big when they were announced. wooloo‚Äôs hype just died down and yamper gets ugly after evolving
Zeraora and Zoroark.

Clearly meant to copy Lucario but didnt work.
    Personally, I was never a big fan of Zeraora, and while Zoroark never got nearly as popular as Lucario, I personally think that it does a much better job standing apart from Zeraora in that department.
        To be fair i dont really like lucario zoroark zeraora esque type of pokemon so to me so i really put them real low
    At least Zoroark reads as its own thing. Zeraora just feels like bargain bin Lucario.
        Definitely.

Zeraora being mythical has no rhyme nor reason.
Its not even a pokemon you get to use in a playthrough since its mythical status.

Like, imagine Zeraora as an in game mon with a prevo(maybe even evo?) I dont think itll be as bad.

Heck its a feline right? Not sure why didnt they just do a tiny electric cat pokemon as a prevo and make it a mon...
            It was just randomly added to Ultra Sun and Moon. The only memorable thing about it was that shiny event in Generation 8.

Despite that, Zarude is probably the Mythical that is the least memorable outside of Phione.
                At least Zarude has that dumb alternate form, but the competition between those two as most unnecessary mythical is still a close competition.
                The randomness of when it came out. It felt like everyone was already moving on from US/UM, and then they just throw this mythical out there like "hey, we forgot we had this thing, so, ugh, here you go."

It's like the exact opposite of Zygarde, where they built up this big thing that everyone thought would lead to a game version Pokemon Z, but they said "haha, Sike. Wait until next Gen so we can shoehorn Zygarde lore in there since we are ~~too lazy to make~~ going to surprise everyone by not making a Z version."
                    I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the 20th anniversary is why the developers didn‚Äôt make Pokemon Z.
                Phione/Manaphy and Zeraora also should have been dual typed. Electric fists? If it was our first electric fighting it would have at least that going for it.
Also Azumarill gets fairy typing but Manaphy doesn't??
                    GF seems dislike adding new type to legenday/mythical Pokemon.
                        Volcanion is the only water/fire Pokemon though
                            I think they were referring to the fact that they would‚Äôve had to have added fairy type to manaphy retroactively. There‚Äôs several Gen 1-5 mythicals that gamefreak could have believably added fairy type to, and they didn‚Äôt add it to any of them - so it seems like they made a conscious decision that they *weren‚Äôt* going to do that.
            Mythicals are way overdone. I think there should be a max of 2 per region (and it's really best to go with just 1). Zeraora also doesn't look mythical to me. It looks great (I actually like its design more than Lucario's), but the second I learned it was mythical... meh, lost interest.
                I liked mythicals when they have like... you know, reasoning for being one.



Zeraora and Volcanion dont have reasons on what they are. They just exist. 

Its not like Magearna or Diancie whos a manmade creation or a mutation.

Nor like Marshadow whos the rainbow feather guardian.
        I like Zeraora, but it kind of feels like someone's Sonic the Hedgehog OC.
    Zeraora gives off this Digimon reject pile vibe.
        OUCH
    I like Zeraora, but never had a chance to obtain it, so... <shrugs>
    At first, I thought "Zeraora" was you mispelling Zorua somehow, if that tells you how little people care/know about/remember that weird cat thing. 

Very much dislike it myself, to be honest.
    Ngl totally forgot zeraora was even a thing until Pokemon unite came out lmao
For gen 1, Clefairy and the Nidoran line. If I recall, Clefairy was first supposed to be the mascot of the game before Pikachu got proposed. And if I recall, I remember an article where Gamefreaks developers thought the Nido family would have been the most popular to use amongst players (well even RB intro features a Nidorino..)
    The Nidos (generally Nidoking) are really popular in Kanto though. Especially for speed runners.
        That‚Äôs nice, I really like them. I think they look the way Satoshi Taijiri first imagined most of Pokemon looking like, kaiju-types mixed with animals. I always have a Nidoking in my team if present in the game :)!
        It's pretty crazy to think that you can get a 3rd stage Mon with good stats before the second gym
            That grows fast and can learn almost everything. And looks awesome!
    Ahhhh, I do love to have a Nido in my party, especially early in the game, so I guess it worked on me
        It worked on me too, I‚Äôm a Nidoran fan since 1998 and will keep being one :)! I was hoping they would come back with the DLC but got really dissapointed :(.
Most generation‚Äôs Pikachu clones

Ironically Mimikyu, a *literal fake Pikachu*, is way more popular than Emolga, Dedenne, Pawmot, etc. Pachirisu gets close, but probably not for reasons they were expecting.
    Mimikyu at least acknowledges the thing it tries to copy. Plus it has a really strange charm to it that I think resonates with a lot of people.
    I honestly don't know why they keep making these. I haven't remembered a single one since Plusle and Minun, since at least they had the memorable feature of being twins and featuring in double battles. Seems like a waste since everyone would just use Pikachu given the chance and I can't imagine anyone needs an electric rodent that bad if Pikachu isn't around.

What happened with Pachirisu?
        It‚Äôs tradition at this point. I doubt they even care about the Pika-clones being popular anymore, it‚Äôs just something that every region needs to feel complete, alongside the birds, rt. 1 normal types, and one or two bug lines. It would feel weird if they excluded them.
        Pachirisu was used to win worlds as a super underground niche pick which got it a decent amount of fame as the face of ‚Äòunderdog‚Äô pokemon / playing with your favourite (even though the player didn‚Äôt care much for pachirisu aside from its unique capabilities until after the win)
    Mimikyu probably would‚Äôve completely upstaged Togedemaru if not for the anime.
Castform perhaps. I can imagine an alternate reality where castform really took off and Gamefreak implemented a bunch of new in-game weathers to give it more forms.
    Poor guy never even got a sandstorm form
        Because otherwise it wouldn't be able to add weather ball to its moveset.

You would have to get rid of one of the weather moves to include sandstorm instead and that would still lock you out of one of its transformations.

Also, I think the real purpose with castform was to show how prominent were weathers as a mechanic when gen 3 came out. 

And it certainly worked. Everyone paid attention to the addition of weathers thanks to castform.
            >Because otherwise it wouldn't be able to add weather ball to its moveset. You would have to get rid of one of the weather moves to include sandstorm instead and that would still lock you out of one of its transformations.
 
Can you elaborate? My brain is having a hard time understanding why this wouldn't work.
                Sunny Day, Rain Dance, Hail, Weather Ball. That fills all four move slots. So if he had a Sandstorm form, you‚Äôd have to give up on one of the other three forms or your only attacking move.
                    Or the trainer could just pick which weather moves to have on it at any given time‚Ä¶
            My Castform‚Äôs four moves were Sunny Day, Flamethrower, Weather Ball, and Thunderbolt, so the 4-move argument literally doesn‚Äôt hold water for me‚Ä¶
    I don't think it was really meant to be popular, it was more of a experiment by GF since it was the first (and on gen 3, the only) pok√©mon to be able to change forms.
        Deoxys was also able to change forms, albeit not during battle.
    Poor Mikey...
I feel like revaroom was meant to be really popular. The only thing that‚Äôs really memorable about it is that team star used buffed forms of them. They even gave varoom slow start, formerly the signature ability of regigigas. It‚Äôs not often that a legendary‚Äôs signature ability gets given to a regular Pok√©mon. It also has a unique typing and signature move but it‚Äôs not very good competitively which contributes to its unpopularity. I think it was also featured in one of the tcg sets recently too.
    >It also has a unique typing and signature move

I don't think that means that it was meant to be popular since most pok√©mon this gen have either a signature ability or signature move (or both, like Espathra, Glimmora, etc) and a lot of pok√©mon have unique or just not common typings
    Yea but that ability is so garbage, giving it to anymon would make it less popula. 
regigigus would do better with turant
        I know it‚Äôs bad, I was just pointing it out because it‚Äôs very unique. Even though slow start is bad it was still a legendary signature ability
    >They even gave Varoom Slow Start

I mean, it‚Äôs a hidden ability, so you really have to go out of your way to get it. Also, it turns into Filter after evolving. Objectively a better upgrade than what Wimpod got‚Ä¶
    Interesting‚Äîit‚Äôs honestly one of my favorites of the paldea pokemon! But I can understand why not everyone likes it.
    Rule #1 for a Pokemon to be popular - people have to like looking at it. Sorry Revaroom.
I wanna say they tried to make minccino/cinccino the new popular cutesy pokemon
    "They were intended to be parallels of¬†Kanto's¬†Clefairy¬†and¬†Clefable; Pok√©mon that everyone would think was cute." -Bulbapedia citing Nintendo Dream

And they were used during the "welcome to the world of Pokemon" intro sequence, so Game Freak was definitely hoping it would leave a good impression.
    i love that line it rlly feels like a line that ur in game mum wud have it‚Äôs also busted in story playthroughs lol i feel like a lotta gen 5 mons suffer from them making it like a semi reboot cos a lotta the pokemon in it end up just less cool versions of older mons but the original unique ones are like amazing like look at bisharp, reuinaclus, gothita line and the legends are easily some of the coolest
    One of my year 8s mentioned this year that Mincinno was his favourite Pokemon.

Thought that was an odd choice, goes to show the old adage of every Pokemon is someones favourite
Quite possibly Raikou, since it‚Äôs one of the legendary trio and should‚Äôve been just as important, but the other two got much more attention and screen-time in other medias, (Guardian Signs is an exception) making a Pok√©mon they probably intended to be on the same plain field in terms of popularity as the other two, instead be on a lower plain field in that department and get overshadowed.
    The expression is ‚Äúplaying field‚Äù btw
        Is this a r/boneappletea in the wild??
        U/bobsplosion mentioned an even ‚Äúplaying field‚Äù. This is actually a zoning issue.
            r/unexpectedoffice
    Hey, at least he got his own TV special, some legendaries have even less
        But Entei and Suicune featured in the third and fourth movies, adding heavily to their mystique; if the pattern had followed, the fifth film could have featured Raikou but instead it was about the upcoming Gen 3 legendaries Latios and Latias‚Äîand besides it being one of my favorite Pok√©mon movies, it does still feel like a missed opportunity.
    suicune was their top dog (top cat?) from day 1 tho, it became a cover legendary despite having no role in crystal‚Äôs plot line and Goh captured one in the anime
        Suicune did have the storyline in Crystal with Eusine chasing it, you get the Clear Bell as well from the radio tower director as well that triggers the event for it.
        Suicune had an entire game with it on the cover while Entei had the third movie. Raikou was screwed over from before even the GBA.
    raikous been my favorite pokemon since i was a kid <3 so happy it‚Äôs catchable in sv indigo disk
    Raikou not having a trainer doesn't help its case. Suicune had Eusine and Goh while Entei had the frontier brain girl. Raikou being alone makes its appearances limited to random occurence in stories
    Especially in the movie I Choose You. Entei and Suicune got whole ass scenes dedicated to them while Raikou just gets a fleeting cameo.
I can't even remember their names but you fought them early in Black and White. The elemental monkeys.
    You might be right. They were kind of a second starter in BW, but imo, they were like a dollar store version of a starter. Much weaker, much more boring (just generic monkeys that happen to have elemental powers), and used too much (used in a gym, given as a gift, and I feel like they were VERY prevalent in Kalos' early game). I think all this contributed to them being super UNpopular. If they were just a rare(ish) encounter found in Pinwheel Forest after the gym, and that's where their prevalence ended, I think they'd be... slightly less hated.

They aren't even the best choice to use against that first gym imo. Lillipup will generally do the job faster (that thing hits like truck in the early game).
    Pansage, Pansear, Panpour

Simisage, Simisear, Simipour
    I said it elsewhere in the thread but I have a hunch that monkey Pok√©mon are a hard sell. Too close to humanoid maybe. Grookie being a slight exception because his fellow starters‚Äô final evolutions are awful looking. But like gen 4 had a monkey starter and it‚Äôs the least popular by a significant amount.
        Infernape is definitely not liked or disliked by any significant amount compared to torterra and empoleon. And humanoid pokemon have been a thing since Gen 1, machop and hitmon lines are popular. I don't think monkeys are worse off
        Too human made me think of Mr mime immediately, seriously catching a Mr mime is enslavement Smdh
Morpeko
    I only ever think of that one [comic](https://twitter.com/JHallComics/status/1159177176413028352?t=OSB0LNQPKANPYGI6xZoziw&s=19) about how Morpeko was designed by a focus group to appeal to millenials.

"I get hangry without my avocado toast! It has pockets!"
    I love morpeko. And Iove that it's based on the idea of Dr. Jekill and Mr. Hyde (that's why it's a guinea pig, because in the story Dr. Jekill uses himself as a "guinea pig" for his experiment and ends up with two personalities". 

Every single pokemon in Galar has some kind of british related inspiration and that is why Morpeko is part of Galar (the protagonist of the story is British).
        A shame the mode switch does next to nothing.  Would've been neat if it altered stats but no it just changes the typing of one move and that's it.
    I had to look him up
    I love Morpeko! But I agree. Even though it was the ace of one of your rivals in Galar it doesn‚Äôt feel like it really stuck around in popularity. Think it could have used an evolution (Moraichu maybe? :p). I think unevolving pokemon often are less popular.
To go for a more recent example, Lechonk was meme status before S/V released, and now nobody gives two shits about the lil guy.
    I think everybody knowing that this was going to happen was part of the meme.
    They were trying hard to make lechonk the next bidoof but it didn't work.
That other electric mouse‚Ä¶ dedenne?
    Small Raichu
    Unironically my favorite Pok√©mon ‚ù§Ô∏è
Incineroar and Cinderace tbh, both are fairly popular but they were clearly intended to blow up a lot more like how Greninja did, especially Cinderace with it getting 2 signature moves and Protean, which was still busted in that gen, and a lot of anime protagonism + being the mascot of Pokemon Unite. Even with all that Cinderace is still not very like that much, I honestly see it as one of the biggest failed attempts by gamefreak.

Incineroar got more popular after a while but that was definitely forced by a lot of shilling, it got added to smash, had a big presence in the anime and kept getting buffs in the games, but when Gen 7 began decidueye was clearly the fan favorite, both primarina and incineroar had a pretty lackluster reception, to not say just straight up a lot of hate.
    > Gen 7 began decidueye was clearly the fan favorite

Incineroar is just incapable of not being talked about however just because of the sheer dominance it had on the competitive scene.
        Yeah I mentioned that in my post, it's crazy how everytime its available it becomes obligatory in most teams
    I think Incineroar failed to gain popularity because the line looked to be going for a quadruped tiger vibe then out of nowhere you get a professional wrestler? I remember so many people being pissed off by Incineroar because they felt let down by the final evolution.
    Cinderance design is just ugly imo. Incineroar I can teeter on the fence with liking or thinking it's cool at least. Idk the last few Gen I feel like the starters are extremely forgetable and unamusing
    [removed]
        With spoons for hands.
Audino

I always imagine some GF employee's daughter drew it and begged for it to be in the game.
    Actually no , Audino is a rare case of a pokemon specifically made for the anime ( like Lugia and Jirachi ) , since Unova was supposed to be a reboot for the series , they thought that when the anime comes out it'll be weird for Nurse Joy to have Chansey on her in Unova so the designers were told to make a Chansey counterpart and thats how Audino was created
        It‚Äôs weird when you look at Gen 5 Pokemon and so many of them are basically direct copies of Gen 1 mons. Not saying they all are but seriously they created a copy of Tauros, Chansey, Hitmonlee and Hitmonchan, etc. They have a geodude copy and even a Hypno copy with Musharna.
    And instead we all just beat up the fat sack of shit for EXP.
        a poor man's Chansey
That electric legendary I forget the name of, speedy bipedal cat thing
    The mythicals in general are such a missed opportunity.  Many of the designs are great but they‚Äôre such a pain to obtain and then they don‚Äôt serve much of a purpose in-game even if you do jump through the hoops to get them.
    Zeraora?
    Zerarora is awesome.
    If I didn't occasionally roll it in randbats I would completely forget this thing exists
In this thread: a bunch of people saying Zoroark is not popular when that's the most common answer here.

I'm gonna go with Throh and Sawk. It felt like they were trying to relive the glory of Hitmonchan and Hitmonlee
    I'm pretty sure Sawk & Throh intentionally were going for Hitmon-vibes knowing that gen 5 was attempting to soft reboot the franchise. There's also more obvious comparisons like Bouffalant/Tauros, the Roggenrola/Geodude lines, & Machop/Timburr lines.
        And Chansey/Audino
    They originally had a horned oni/ogre theme but they sanded it away before release to just be generic humanoids. What a weird choice, would have at least made them visually unique
    All i see when i look at those two guys is bog-standard uninspired fighting types. Really unsure how they made the cut. No secondary type, no gimmick, design is literally blue/red martial artist but it's made of polygons. Idk, big failure as a whole
    It‚Äôs like the whole ‚ÄúCharizard is overrated‚Äù nonsense being repeated ad nauseum to the point that it‚Äôs no longer accurate.
I don't exactly have many thoughts to offer that haven't been said, But, I am a bit perplexed by all the hate for Zorua/Zoroark. Also confused by the Idea that they are *not* popular. It's regularly Ranked in the top 5-10 of  of it's generation.
    Right? I mean, I absolutely agree that gamefreak tried to make it the new Lucario and that it isn't quite on that level of popularity. But it's still massively popular is what I thought.  
I personally love it, much more so than Lucario. I was so happy when in BW2 you were finally able to get one. I use it on every single Black 2 run I'm doing.
        I'm of the same mind, mostly. I don't feel like they 'failed'... Just that B/W and Gen 5 was very hit/miss for people... And, I might be bold in saying this, I don't know a person IRL that grew up with or has played Gen 5 that likes Lucario *more* than Zoroark...
    The fact everyone is saying it kinda shows how popular it is
    People saying Zoroark isn't as popular because they aren't Lucario, is like saying that Lance is not a popular champion because he's not Cynthia.
Id like to mention the opposite of what you describe‚Ä¶ a pokemon that had every right to be super popular, was abandoned by gamefreak but still beloved by the community, Flygon!
    Bro, Swampert that is basically the best starter (based on stats and type combination) and a literal starter, was literally ignored, like it barely appeared in the anime, and was a literal starter
Cinderace. It was clearly intended to be the most popular Gen 8 starter, since it was much better than the other two both in-game and competitively, along with being Goh's ace.
    Its hands are fucking terrifying‚Ä¶
    Cinderace is popular though, lots of merchandise and different TCG-cards of it, it's just the "Ermahgerd!  It's just a guy in a fursuit!"-brigade (The anti-humanoid-pokemon lot) that makes it seem disliked.
        Fair point, though it's still nowhere near as popular as Charizard or Greninja, even though GF probably intended it to be as popular.
Marill was originally supposed to be the Gen 2 Pikachu. Not in the 'clone' sense like Pachirisu or Morpeko but as a cute, super popular mascot.
    Yeah I remember seeing it all over the place when Gen 2 was coming out
        It was the second gen 2 Pok√©mon seen after Togepi. When we met Tracy in the orange islands he had a Maril and it was a big deal at the time. Never took off in the same popularity though. Sad, it was a good design
            Ho-oh was in the first ep so Marill is actually third then.
Possibly Gholdengo... But then that failed at the design stage. The 1000 Pokemon, great competitively, difficult evolving method, and it ends up constantly compared to a cheese string mascot. I get what they were going for overall, but I do wonder why they didn't go for a more 'neutral' design.
    Don't forget about the stupidity that is Gimmighouls' Roaming Form.

We can catch up to legendary Pokemon running at high speeds, but can't catch a tiny coin gremlin. Nevermind it wouldn't even be worth using if we could get it normally anyway, since it evolves into the exact same thing.
        I have a ton of them if you want one. They made them Pokemon Go exclusive like Meltan.

I've just been passing them out in Home through wonder trade.
        I genuinely felt so disappointed when I learned that roaming Gimmighoul evolves into Gholdengo the same as the regular forms. I don't know what I would've expected, but it definitely feels like a letdown that there's literally nothing special about them at all
    At least it's both famous and infamous in competitive. Can't say the same for some other attempt.
    I sort of agree, but I think the fact that it looks so dumb just adds to the charm. I think making it look cool would actually make it less cool. Being goofy cheese man just works.
        I love the goofy string cheese. I play it in the tcg and every week I get someone asking me if I brought the string cheese back (probably at least partially because it isn‚Äôt very good lol)
    I think it's too early to call for Gholdengo. It might become the new Landorus rather than the new Lucario
    [deleted]
    Gholdengo is so baffling, it felt like more a cartoon character than a pok√©mon. I am surprised they didn't get anyone to say it is a cheese string thing... and I have actually not even been exposed that much to food ads.

It is still relatively popular because it is super useful in raids but it is more in spite of its looks. I absolutely won't spend a dollar on it... or maybe for a joke gift.
        I haven‚Äôt played Pok√©mon since gen IV and needed to look up who Gholfengo was. It absolutely does not look like a pok√©mon. I know the art direction has shifted since then, but it baffles me how many of the modern ones aren‚Äôt instantly recognizable as pok√©mon.
    Damn though, Frigo knows how to rock the comp scene.
    shiny should've been platinum.
        platinum, rose gold, white gold, all of them would have been so much better. idk what they were doing with his shiny when they had so many clear and obvious choices that could have been great
        if next game has cheese string it should have different coins to use to evolve it so like u pick up silver coins u get a silver one i love gholdengo i wish it had a cooler shiny
    It's a beast, surfs instead of walking and it's made of pure gold, it's not mega popular just because it's not a dragon or a dog that walks on two legs.
    Do..do people not like Gholdengo? I think it's cool and it's design is fine
        Gameplay wise I like Gholdengo. I just don't like looking at them
Literally any of the Mythical‚Äôs that get released as DLC and get their own movie. Zerazora, Marshadow, Calyrex, Zarude. Who gives an F about these.
    Calyrex and Kubfu weren‚Äôt even in the anime or the films‚Ä¶
    I love Marshadow myself
    Marshadow is the best :(
Okay hear me out: box legendaries. The later the gen, the more they want you to want the box legendaries, but not all box legendaries are created equal
    i feel like most of the box legendaries are pretty memorable... with the exception of zacian and zamazenta. they're the *only* two box legends that i regularly forget exist, and that's coming from someone who likes both of them

why they made it so you can only actually catch them in the goddamn *post game* i will never understand
    The ease at which you can catch them just invalidates their awesomeness. The Time/Space trio were the last box legendaries that were both extremely hard to catch and weren‚Äôt necessary to catch in order to progress through the story.
    Honestly, I feel like they‚Äôve been getting better and better at incorporating box legendaries into the game. I mean, the worst they did was gold and silver - just before the Elite 4, apropos of nothing, going ‚Äúhey, go catch this thing.‚Äù I remember hearing someone say that they usually don‚Äôt use the box legendary in their party because it makes it too easy, but that they went back on their rule for Solgaleo or Lunala because it felt more ‚Äúearned‚Äù I guess.
        Gen 2 handled the box legendaries in an interesting way, imo. They were optional secrets. More an evolution of the Gen 1 legendary birds than what we would come to recognize as box legendaries. They were each hidden within a formidable dungeon that you had to seek out yourself. You also got both box legendaries regardless of game, since the other mascot appeared in the post game (albeit without its signature move). The game didn't hand the legendary to you, but instead hinted at its lore and pointed you to go find it yourself. 

Gen 3 was really the start of the story-based box legendary formula. And pretty much every generation since has used Gen 3 as a rough template. Even HGSS reworked Ho-Oh and Lugia to fit the formula set by Groudon and Kyogre.
        To be fair, legendaries weren't given any real plot significance until Gen 3, maybe excepting Suicune's minor storyline in Gen 2. That's actually how I prefer legendaries.
        Look i dont mind the box legendaries,  but i feel like legendaries overall feel very... meh? Like good stats, but what i like about pokemon is the catching aspect, so in games with more legendaries or just funner pokemon (not necessarily better) im gonna forget about a lot of them
skiddo and gogoat lmao, they were promoted HARD in XY
    They should have been available on more than one route in that game. It would make so much sense to get to catch one on the same route as the ranch!
        That and way more opportunities to ride them than some dude's backyard
Kecleon gets a notable mini quest in RSE, has notable appearances in the anime and spin-offs, and was given Protean as a HA later on but damn if it‚Äôs popularity has always been niche. I constantly forgot that Go didn‚Äôt add it for a few years after the entire rest of the Hoenn dex was there. I think most people‚Äôs memorable experience with it is trying to steal from the PMD shop and getting slaughtered by them- and while that guarantees some niche popularity it never reached the heights one might expect from a Pok√©mon the game goes out of its way to highlight to the player
    Probably doesn't help that its only halfway-decent stats are SpD and attack, but it has a mediocre support move pool and its best physical attacks are sucker punch, foul play, iron tail and strength.
I have to disagree on Haxorus, its so popular that people often mistake him to be Gen5 pseudo legend.
As for an answer, I‚Äôd go with Zorua/Zoroark like everyone is saying. Meant to be gen5‚Äôs Lucario, but self-sabotaged by the method of obtaining it in-game
    Everyone is saying Zoroark, but I feel it's still super popular, no? Not on Lucario's level of course, but still easily one of the most popular of gen 5. Maybe this came later, and when gen 5 was current it wasn't popular.
        i for sure remember it being one of the more popular designs when bw came out but people had a hard on for hating gen 5 when it came out also a very popular mon in the furry community but i feel like it‚Äôs hard to not be popular  in that community lol
        Exactly, Haxorus and specially Zoroark were extremely pokemon.

Zoroark was definitely treated as the new Lucario back then (it even got its own movie). And everyone wanted to have one on their team.

It's just that it's been four generations since then.
Toxtricity.

The game basically hands you one for free very early one. Was technically the first GMAX form shown [as Gmax toxtricity was foreshadowed before Dynamax or even GMAX was revealed](https://dotesports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/16213010/Screenshot_2019-11-16-11-Pok%C3%A9mon-Sword-Pok%C3%A9mon-Shield-%E2%80%93-Overview-trailer-Nintendo-Switch-YouTube1.jpg))

You get two forms of it, it was the only event exclusive GMAX at the time besides Pikachu, Eevee and Meowth, and it had a noteworthy signature move.
    I think they thought the whole ‚Äòband‚Äô concept they had with Toxtricity and Rillaboom was going to be more successful. I think they would both be better off without the drums/guitars.
    Really? I still think Toxtricity is one of the best designs to come out of Gen 8 and definitely the star of my team in my Sword playthrough. I wish we got to keep around that beastly lizardesque gigantamax form.
    Toxitricity is definitely one the most popular gen 9 pokemon
Gothitelle line was supposed to be the next Gardevoir but failed.
it‚Äôs not particularly unpopular but i feel like the treecko line was meant to be the ‚Äúcool‚Äù one of gen 3 starters but in gen 3 it was just not very good so hardly anyone used it and most people fell in love with mudkip or torchic which fair but treecko gets nowhere near enough love
    I feel like the mystery dungeon games brought him above the others with grovyle
        oh shit yeah good point i totally forgot about that 
grovyle has definitely gotta be the most liked middle stage starter
    [deleted]
    If Treeko had been fire or water type it might‚Äôve been a different story.  Grass starters almost always get the short end of the stick from the fanbase.  Doesn‚Äôt help that Torchic and Mudkip are cuter first stage Pok√©mon.  The Treeko line are my favorite, but they can be a hard sell without the prior knowledge of Sceptile.
While not hated, and I even like Midday and Midnight forms Lycanroc was suppose to be like a Lucario for generation 7 with the special promotion it got pre-release. Got a special form in USM alongside new Z-move and most gens have at least one trainer that has one.
No mention for Type:Null and Silvally?

Dudes were everywhere in the promotional material for sun and moon, were an integral part of the story, they were meant to be Mewtwo 2.0 but for arceus... Big reveal when Silvally is finally unleashed.. 

And then it turns out to be literally just Walmart arceus. Not a single redeeming quality, no personality, absolutely nothing special about him. Big disappointment
    How far I had to scroll to find this answer speaks for itself.
I‚Äôm not sure if this was a necessarily ‚Äúintended‚Äù to be big pokemon, but in retrospect I‚Äôm kind of suprised that Manectric never got that popular? Especially with the natural popularity of wolves- and it has a sleek design too! In a way it‚Äôs like a mashup of Luxray and Lucario, who are both super popular?
    Probably because it doesnt have ears and instead has a strange conehead, looking at catgirls and cat ear headphones and stuff like that i think ears are one of the cuteness factors of cat/dog style designs
    I‚Äôm pretty sure Manectric is supposed to be a lion. It has ‚Äúmane‚Äù in its English name and its Japanese name is ‚ÄúLivolt‚Äù (possibly lion+volt).
        looks like a [maned wolf](https://nationalzoo.si.edu/sites/default/files/styles/wide/public/animals/manedwolf-005.jpg?itok=H_cbgGNC) to me
cyclizar. I feel like being the present form of miraidon and koraidon, it was supposed to be a super unique thing that everyone loves and while nobody dislikes it, it‚Äôs really not that popular especially considering how many npcs have them and how common they are.
    I agree, I remember seeing them and being like ‚Äúis that the box legendary pre-evolution?‚Äù Now, I just look at it as ‚Äúwell, that‚Äôs a lame Pokemon‚Äù
Milotic feels really popular to me, but mainly because of its rarity and difficulty to obtain in certain games (screw you 4 squares in mt coronet)
    ‚ÄúRookie‚Ä¶‚Äù

-Gen 3‚Äôs 6 tiles
They tried *so hard* to make Kommo-o cool, and it just isn't. It's fun competitively at least
Sadly, my absolute favorite, Absol. I know it has a decent fanbase, but it's never used and GF constantly ignores it now instead of doing what they can to make it viable.
    they gave it a mega. its appeared in multiple movies and anime episodes across multiple generations. its a playable mon in pokemon unite (and lowkey busted). thats more attention than a lot of the starters lol.
    This is one of the most popular ones üòê
    absol is a travesty, i love that thing but it constantly gets ignored and forgotten about
I can tell you a few Pokemon that they didn‚Äôt intend to be super popular but a certain fanbase thought otherwise üëóüí¶üêá
    Gardevoir and Lopunny, the queens of the Pok√©mon NSFW underworld.
        The day I found out people made NSFW art/comics of those 2 is the day my brain broke. I thought Gardevoir was a graceful pokemon with good stats but now I can never have that pokemon on my team again..because of the implication
        I'd say they're pretty popular, even if part of why they're popular is sketchy. I may be biased though, since Gardevoir is my fave. Its dex entries actually sealed the deal for me, and all the rampant NSFW takes can't tank my joy of it.
        Id throw braixen in there too
    Assuming the droplet emoji is supposed to represent Vaporeon, sure he's going through a renaissance, but he's still only 3rd place on e621 right now, behind Umbreon and Sylveon.
    Gardevoir was your Rival's signature Pokemon in it's debut generation. Definitely feels like it was designed to be popular.
Hazorus is popular in my heart. My Unova run usually has it.
Zeraora I feel like it would have been more noticeable if it wasn‚Äôt a mythical. And I don‚Äôt think the movie helped
Pretty much every starter since gen 6
GF should study this thread. A quick read basically shows 'Pokemon that attempt to imitate previously super popular Pokemon fail'.

  
Whole thread is just Pikachu clones, cutesy mon clones, Lucario clones etc.

  
Meanwhile the originals are mega popular, partly because they were original. I mean what else is like Greninja?
Gholdengo. Very much so. As much as I find this Pokemon charming, a lot of people are put off by its design. It was hyped up to be the 1000th Pokemon and they and their pre evolution Gimmighoul are treated like legendary status. Having events around them, being a beast in competitive, being shiny locked etc. I love it personally. But many don‚Äôt.
I feel like Munchlax fits this
    Came here to say this one, Munchlax was pushed REALLY heavily as an attempt at comic relief across different forms of media and it just never worked.
Do Minccino and Cinccino count as well? She is kinda popular but I feel like she just got outshined by Emolga. Guess being a cute adorable rodent is already a crowded creature category.
I LOVE Haxorus. One of my favorites. But I agree, you don‚Äôt see him mentioned a lot despite being a physical powerhouse that can take many of the other dragons down.
Every Pikachu clone. Especially Morpeko.
Jokes on you milotic is my favorite Pok√©mon. I trade out my starter for one in every game I play.
I would assume Volcanion since they gave it a fully unique typing and made it a mythical.
All the pikachu clones. All the electric rodents that are clearly trying to recapture the magic of pikachu but miss the mark.
    Ironic that Mimimyu, which *in-universe* is just trying to make everyone like it by pretending to be a Pikachu, seems to have been the most successful in this endeavor.

Also unpopular opinion but I kinda like Togedemaru more than Pikachu. I like cute spherical things.
Milotoc is popular, not like, runaway crazy popular, but people really like it.
Any Pikachu clone. Morpeeko, plusle and minun, togedemaru. You know GameFreak wants to make plushies galore of these creatures but, I could be wrong, no one seems to care
The Hangry pokemon
All of the Not Pikachus
I don't doubt they were banking on Incineroar being the popular one over Decidueye.
All mythicals from Gen 6 and onwards. I feel like most of them are very hyped up by marketing, most even getting movies or special gimmicks. But none of them have gotten as popular as gen 1-5 mhthicals. Hell, gen 9 doesn‚Äôt even have one, I think they‚Äôve realized no one cares anymore.
The Poliwag Line in Gen 1 I think is a major one that missed the mark.

I really think they were trying to remake the popularity of Lucario/Zoroark with Zeroara but even with giving the thing away (as a SHINY) and giving it a movie it just missed the mark and not many cared about it outside the resident Furry Fandom.

Gothitelle and it's line felt like a blatant attempt to win the hearts of Gardevoir Fans from previous gens but didn't quite hit it (the Hatterene line in Gen 8 did a better job imo)

More than a few gen 5 mons I felt were trying to cater/replicate the popularity of previous mons that filled similar roles but just fell flat. 

As much as I adore Calyrex to the point it's one of my top favorite legendaries, I feel like Calyrex itself is often thrown to the wayside in favor of it's own mounts (and if it is talked about it is usually how busted it's Rider Forms were in gen 8 only to get nerfed in gen 9)
I'm expecting they want Pawmot to be the next mascot, but there is just no way to replicate the worldwide recognition of Pikachu.
Meloetta? I recall there was an emphasis on it in the anime, but it was overshadowed by all the other gen 5 mythicals (and there were a ton!).
ITT: A bunch of incredibly popular Pok√©mon
Gallade.

I feel like it was made as a male counterpart to Gardevoir to appeal more to the male fanbase, however it was introduced in the same gen as Lucario, which filled a similar niche but was wildly more popular.
    But it can learn false swipe and hypnosis so is excellent for catching pokemon.
Most of the pika clones starting with Marill
    Marill was incredibly popular for a while though.  Pika-blu lives on in the hearts of many!
    I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one who has to make a point that Marill is a Pikaclone despite the typing‚Ä¶
The "Legendary" Arcanine.  I feel like it should've gotten another evolution in the later games or something.  Hisuian Arcanine is cool, but not the extra thing Arcanine needs to be "Legendary"  A Mega Evolution would be awesome for it.
Jangmo-o line
Electivire.
Clefairy, was going to be a mascot in the 90's. It was heavily featured in some early Mangas etc. But Pikachu was more popular so Pikachu became the official mascot after the anime came out
i‚Äôm surprised to hear about milotic because that‚Äôs one of my favorite pok√©mon haha

anyways, i feel like lechonk qualifies for this. it seemed like there was an attempt to make it the bidoof (and to a lesser extent, wooloo) of the generation (goofy early route normal type). they pushed promo cards, event giveaways, social media posts etc. people were into it for like a month and since then i feel like it‚Äôs lost a lot of cultural relevancy. the cult following for bidoof for example was organic and i think it‚Äôs hard for a brand to replicate that through an engineered push
I'm pretty sure they made a really big push for Poliwhirl to be a sort of secondary mascot for the series. It was on pretty much all the merch that had more than Pikachu for a long time and it was Red's first partner in the manga.

Beyond that, though, I think Phione and Sky Shaymin are good examples. Phione has no reason to exist outside of an expectation that people would think it's cuter than Manaphy, but it very easily gets overlooked because of how pointless and redundant it is, and most people seem to think Manaphy is cuter. As for Shaymin, it just requires way too much maintenance to ever want to use.
Nidorino. it showed up for like a few seconds in the whole decades worth of cartoon but it was like pretty much on every merchandise during the Kanto era
Snubbull, it‚Äôs so prominent in the build to gen 2 then just didn‚Äôt take off
The 3 elemental monkeys. They‚Äôre all hated
The missed the boat by not including Poliwrath in the Elite 4. If Bruno had Poliwrath and PrimeApe instead of two non-fighting, weak Onix, everyone would come out ahead. 

Bruno would be taken more seriously. 

Poliwrath would get some more clout. 

Onix would even get more clout because as it is, its stats are a joke by that point in the game. Leave it as the first "boss" and at least it might still -seem- intimidating.
    I never understood that. It's not a Lance situation where there just aren't anymore dragons so you have to use dragon-looking Pokemon. There's literally 2 more fully evolved fighting types to use.
        i think their idea was for each one to use one non-specialization typed pokemon, but even then there are better choices
            like coulve used golem, instead of atleast 1 of the onix.

Since rhydon was for giovanni adn your rival
                not to mention it‚Äôs even worse cuz he uses two of them‚Äîreplace one with poliwrath or primeape, and it‚Äôd still be much better than its actual form

hell, even if we want to go beyond rock types or the golem option, electabuzz strikes me as on-theme based on its significant arms. Pinsir, Kangaskhan, Exsecutor

if we‚Äôre keeping it open to pokemon other trainers use, both nidos and rhydon would also be good
                    >Pinsir, Kangaskhan, Exsecutor

Pinsir and Kangaskhan are cool suggestions, but I can't wrap my head around how you came up with giving Bruno an Exeggutor.
                    The Elite 4 should have been considered dual type specialists from the start. Lorelei would have officially been ice/water, Bruno as fighting/rock, Agatha as ghost/poison, and Lance as dragon/flying. It would have helped them stand out from the gym leaders who stick to one type, and since Lance would no longer be coy with half of his team being flying types, we couldn‚Äôt rag on him for being a ‚Äúdragon‚Äù trainer.
            Young me assumed that the Onixes were to counter your beefed-out Pidgeot that you'd had since early game.
        Because the E4 is fodder for you to train for the Champion. Also, the mons you face are reminiscent of bosses in order to evoke past fights. That's why Lorelei is so similar to Misty (redhead trainer with water mons), Bruno to Brock (shirtless fighter with messy hair and Onix) and Agatha to Team Rocket ("evil" lady with Golbat, Arbok and Haunter line).
        [deleted]
            I mean you'd have a point if the "wildcard" pokemon were actually strong pokemon. But practically every run I've seen (and I've been watching a LOT of Red and Blue runs lately, shoutout to JROSE11) the Onixes are always one-shots. Hell, plenty of times he sets up stat-boosts against them because they're so weak they don't pose a threat. 

MAYBE you could say Poliwrath would be beaten by whatever Grass or Electric type you used to sweep Lorelei, but Grass will still sweep Onix. If you want Electric coverage, than sub one for a Golem. Maybe a Marowak.
    Funny enough that ends up being Chuck's team in Gen2
        Then Chuck could have used Heracross and/or Hitmontop.
    But he obviously uses the Onixes to counter Flying-types!
        He might wanna invest in literally any other rock or electric type Pok√©mon
            Victory road is all the way over there though
    Bit of a crime that Bruno doesn't have Poliwrath or Primeape. 

I've always been curious behind the choices for gym leaders and the E4 in Gen 1 & 2. Some of them just don't make any sense.
    Polywrath is my favorite Pok√©mon still!
    Wait. Bruno was a fighting type specialist? I thought he was rock. Basically, an older shirtless relative of Brock.
    [deleted]
    What's even weirder is that Poliwrath is one of I think 3 pokemon that do not appear at all in red/blue so you literally never see the sprite during a playthrough unless you yourself catch one (or battle a friend that has one). That type of exclusion is really weird to me.
Also Poliwrath line is Red's starter in the manga.
    I remember reading the manga first time during my childhood. Red‚Äôs first mons were poliwhirl, bulbasaur and pikachu.
    The manga is the best pokemon media that exists CMV. They do the world such justice. The battles were fun and creative, the characters were fun and interesting, and the gyms were cooler.

Also the creator said its the closest depiction of pokemon to the world he imagined than any game movie or show
        Just recently discovered the manga myself, been a fan of pokemon since ‚Äò98. Hard agree on the quality, the pokemon moves are so much squishier in terms of versatility.
        What‚Äôs cmv?
            "Change my view"
        I love the Pok√©mon manga but the hardest part of it is that the manga in recent years have suffered due to the breakneck pack of the games‚Äô release. The manga has to keep up with the constant releases now and that has led to the last few arcs being incredibly rushed and less character and Pok√©mon development
    That‚Äôs interesting, I forgot this. I guess it‚Äôs because Poliwhirl is apparently Satoshi Taijiri‚Äôs favorite Pok√©mon (hence its heavy appearances in Gen 1 stuff.)
I was thinking about how it was odd and random that my first email address as a kid, in like 2000, involved Poliwhirl. Then I saw some of the marketing/promotional material from that time period and it makes way more sense. Poliwhirl was everywhere during that period and then sort of fell off into irrelevance with gen 2.
    he did get a neat evo in gen 2, but trade evos in general are a pain if you're playing by yourself
        Yeah having a trade evo as your favorite sucks
        Which always sucked cause Gengar has always been my favorite from the start.
Has a huge role in the early manga. He‚Äôs Red‚Äôs ace over Pikachu even.
The Poly line is still one of my favorites of any gen. Polywag is just too adorable. Definitely a top 5/10 line and first evo for me
    I remember having a poliwhirl plushie like 25 years ago lol. Thing was nice af
Poliwhirl is one of my favorites at least. Back during Pokemania just as the first movie was coming out, Burger King had all these Pok√©mon toys for kids meals. I was so excited to open up a Pokeball and get a Poliwhirl plush.
Still one of my favourites because I got a doll of it when I was young and it just looks cool
Poliwhirl is the GOAT wdym
I had a poliwhirl birthday cake when I was a kid which my mum made for me so the fact it‚Äôs recognised by people who know nothing about Pok√©mon says something. Wish it was the same level as Charzard
Hell yeah on poliwhirl, i remember as a kid getting a bunch of gen 1 pokemon stickers with the old art style after doctors‚Äô visits and among the more recognizable genwunners like koffing, diglett, venonat, magnemite, beedrill, jigglypuff, there was poliwag, not exactly poliwhirl but it‚Äôs the same evolution line, it‚Äôs near and dear to me for this reason
I remember thinking that was weird as hell even as a kid *during* Gen 1. Like, "why is Poliwhirl everywhere? It's not cute or tough looking."
Yesss! I love my Poliwhirl tape measure ü•π
Definitely worked on me, Poliwhirl and by extension Politoed, are two of my favorite pok√©mon
Poliwag and POliwhirl *are* some of my faves though! I don't as much like poliwrath unfortunately.
I believe Poliwhirl was also supposed to be the poster child for the concept of evolution.  In the same way that bugs were the concept for catching little monsters in the first place, creatures like tadpoles that mature into frogs and caterpillars that become butterflies were the basis for Pok√©mon evolution
Clefairy being designed as the series mascot is the reason why in-game pokemon dolls are clefairies.
    Oh, cool! That makes so much sense!
It's pretty sad for clefairy as i remember back in the 90's it was everywhere with a ton of merch and it kinda was the second mascot after pikachu. Then it got forgotten after gen ii came out.

Clefairy was still one of my first favorite pokemon so i still love him. ‚ù§
    what‚Äôs crazy is that the second mascot of pokemon is still from gen 1 but it‚Äôs eevee instead of clefairy lol
        Plus Jigglypuff totally overshadowed it in popularity thanks to its role in the anime.  Clefairy really lost out.

On the other hand Clefable is an actually good Pok√©mon game wise and Wigglytuff is pretty terrible so I suppose it's balanced itself in some ways.
            Jigglypuff also got the Smash Bros popularity bump too.
                that‚Äôs bcs of the anime popularity buff tho tbf
                    It definitely could have influenced it a little bit, but from my understanding Sakurai really loved Kirby and wanted a second fighter with a similar model.
                        >Sakurai really loved Kirby

of course, Kirby is Sakurai's creation
            Clefairy actually is more viable than Clefable in the officially competitive format which is neat!
        Let's Go Clefairy would had been awesome ngl.
            But instead of getting it from Professor Oak you had to go to Mount Moon to get your starter. Which kind of resembles a lot of characters from the anime, like Iris and Axew.
        For me, Eevee isn't my favorite pokemon, but when you include its evolutionary line it feels like the most pokemon of any pokemon.
Tbf, pink isn‚Äôt a ¬´¬†gender neutral¬†¬ª color, unlike yellow that is. Pink isn‚Äôt usually adored by small boys (¬´¬†ew girls¬†¬ª). On top of that, yellow isn‚Äôt a very common color in mascots, making it easier for Pikachu to be recognised. The only other big mascot at the time was Winnie The Pooh.

In overall, switching to Pikachu was quite a good choice
    As a kid, I saw Yellow and Pink as equally "feminine" colours because of the original Power Rangers. I still remember how odd I though it was when I saw the first male "Yellow Ranger"
        Yellow Ranger was masculine in the series that Saban spliced to make Mighty Morphin‚Äô. You‚Äôll notice only Pink‚Äôs suit has the little skirt.
    All colors are gender neutral if you‚Äôre not a little b@&$h about it.
    The Simpsons?
Yeah it has a manga where it's the main character. The talking Pokemon one.
I imagine having Clefairy as the mascot would lead to tough fights in the anime being won due to Metronome pulling out the right move to use.
I know it's not mass market but clefable and the entire clefairy line at least got more  recognition from the competitive community once it got fairy typing. Oh boy fairy type, good move pool letting it run 8+ builds and magic guard/unaware made it the best Pok√©mon of gen 6 in singles (Smogon) and among the top in gen 7 and 8. Pretty good for rejected mascot. 

If nothing else it's my favourite. My bold T-waving calm minding monster still gives my mates nightmares.
There are now only 7 Pok√©mon that cannot be transferred to any Switch games.

Six of them are the Gen V elemental monkeys and their evolutions.

The seventh is Furfrou.

Edit: I've been informed that I missed a few.
    There are a few other pokemon still trapped in home jail.

Patrat and Watchog

Alolan Form Rattata and Raticate (In the Let's Go games but a Alolan Rattata transferred from Bank isn't transferable to Let's Go)

Spinda (In BDSP but for some reason BDSP Spinda can't be transfered to home. Likewise Spinda transferred from bank can't be transferred to BDSP)
        Apparently the reason why spinda isn‚Äôt transferable is because the coding used for its spots were all done backwards. So it‚Äôs just straight up incompatible with home. Hope you didn‚Äôt get a shiny one
            It's not that Spinda is incompatible with HOME, but that Spinda from outside games are incompatible with BDSP and Spinda from BDSP... well, they can't go anywhere anyway. So you can bring a Spinda up into HOME, but then it's stuck there until Game Freak puts it in another game.

I honestly find it to be a profoundly offensive oversight that this bug has not been fixed. I personally don't care about Spinda at all, but every Pok√©mon is somebody's favorite and I feel terrible for anyone who might have transferred a Spinda to HOME from Gen VII who now cannot play with their beloved Pok√©mon. To me, that goes against the entire spirit of Pok√©mon.

I have a similar rant about Dexit, but it's basically the same point except longer so I won't bore anyone by going into that.
            It was transferrable at some point, because I got a pile in my home boxes. Trapped , I assume.
And then Gogoat inexplicably makes it onto Geeta's team. Also there was a meme that Gamefreak forgot about that line for a while. It was also the last regular Gen 6 Pokemon added to Go.
Im kinda mad tauros got the water/fire versions this game 

Imagine skiddo/gogoats but of different elements 

Give me all the goats
    Tauros got forms because bulls are a big thing in Spain.
        I understand fully and dont think it is wrong. 

I just want Ele-goats and am petty-mad because Gogoat is my top 5 favs
I'd argue that Furfrou wasn't supposed to be a popular Pokemon, at least outside of Kalos. It was clearly just supposed to represent the Frenchness of XY.  It's a poodle!  And you can dress it up!  So fancy, so French!  It's the same reason why trainer clothes were initially introduced.
Zoroark not being normally available in BW is a big part of why it didn‚Äôt remain popular, imo.  If I can‚Äôt use it, how am I gonna learn to love it?
    I have to wonder, parts of Zoroark make me think they intended for it to be a playground rumor. This Pokemon you can't get, but has a surprise reveal during N's final battle, and the mysterious Lostlorn Forest with no apparent purpose? The Zorua you read about in Castelia, but can't find anywhere? That screams playground rumor material.

But then on the other hand, they gave it a whole damn movie, tons of exposure, and a huge amount of attention in the shiny beasts event *long* before BW released.

They tried to recreate Lucario *and* Mew at the same time, when both were successful for different, opposing reasons.
        Locario and the Mystery of Mew you say?
            No, Lucario and mew. The Pokemons. The first one was HEAVILY featured both in the games and in the promotional material pre release of the games. You can see Lucario in a gym leader's team in DPP, In the champion's team in DPP and in the team of a beloved npc during his quest line. It was featured heavily in the anime, in the movies, and it's easily available as an egg halfway through the game. Lucario is effectively a mascot of gen 4, it's easily available but also very special and unique.

On the other hand mew was only featured in one movie during gen 1's lifespan. It's almost never mentioned in the game, featured only in descriptions, and normally it's not obtainable without a proper event or distribution, which incidentally happened only in Japan during the release of its own movie. It's eeriness, the not knowing whether it really existed or not, spawned a ton of playground theories. The mystique around it was part of its popularity.

It seems that they wanted to make a pokemon that was mysterious and elusive to obtain enough to create legends and theories about itself at the playgrounds, but that at the same time was at the forefront of that franchise, being basically everywhere in anime, movies and all promotional material. If you know that something REALLY EXISTS and what it can do, then it has no mystery left to reveal. 

Arceus is so beloved by the franchise because it was treated Like mew, something so legendary and elusive that it has an aura of mystery. It's barely mentioned in the games, impossible to obtain without an event that was never distributed, and only officially revealed with its own movie.
                Arceus is an example of Game Freak REALLY getting a Pok√©mon right. The Sinjoh Ruins event in HGSS is one of the weirdest and most memorable events in any Pok√©mon game. PLA also did a fantastic job making Arceus feel like... well, Arceus. If only every mythical could be so realized.
    Riolu on the other hand was made available halfway through the game as a gift egg at iron island, with a very fun quest line associated with it. It makes you want to get it after seeing it being featured heavily in the teams of some of the coolest trainers in the game
    Sneasel syndrome.

\- Appears ultra late in Gen2 and 4, but also can't evolve in Gen 4 despite having unevolved stat line.
    Yep. I remember, I saw the movie on Cartoon Network and thought "gee, that's a cool Pok√©mon. Can't wait to get one in the new game." Then, while playing the game, I found out that you can't actually get one in the game. Then years later, I found out that it was connected to an event that I had no idea even happened when it did.
I think Zoroark is popular enough to not be discussed here.

Like, sure, it never got as popular as the top tier mons like Lucario, Charizard, Pikachu, Eevee, and Greninja - but it‚Äôs up there. As popular as many mythicals that received movies and event status.

Especially with its Hisuian form it got way more popular.

I think it‚Äôs Hisuian form having an exclusive typing is the one thing the original was lacking that really makes it great. If it had had that from the beginning it would have been even more popular.

I don‚Äôt think availability has anything to do with it because, as mentioned, Riolu is just has easily available these days.
I honestly expected it to be a fighter in Smash 4 but it sadly missed the window since XY came out.
"Event" (i.e. enter a digital code) Pokemon is the stupidest idea Gamefreak ever had, imo.
    It's a great tool for keeping people's attention, not so great for the actual players themselves.
I feel like zoroark and lucario getting their own movies shows that they were designed to be pseudos (or at least pseudo-pseudo) leading to, at least zoroarks, rarity. This could also work (albeit less) for pokemon like milotic also being mentioned here a lot. 

I almost feel like it opens up the possibility for another level of rarity after mythical, legendary, pseudo, then ________. 

This new category containing those pokemon falling short of the pseudo title but still maintaining an air of superiority over your more commonplace pokemon for either rarity, power, or even simply detail into the lore and history of the pokemon. Most of the pokemon discussed in this thread could probably fall under this category honestly for various reasons.

Examples including again zoroark, lucario, both non-legendaries with there own movies, and milotic for its rarity, but also possibly home to pokemon like arcanine who was originally designed be at least connected to the legendary bird trio or even gyarados who (at least in the anime and pokedex entries) is described as a monstrous beast of the sea deeply feared by sailors. Even the clefairy line with being so tanky and only found in mount moon with an entire lore around them could also fall into this list. 

Basically a lot of the pokemon in this thread come together to create this idea of the pseudo-pseudos that were hoped for popularity and wrestling either overshadowed or feel short, or meant to feel like playground rumor
    Pseudos with rarity of legendaries are weird. Paradox Pokemon would be legendary post Gen 9 as we would have no way of obtaining them after SV era ends. Ultra Beasts are in the same spots, but is treated as a legendary rightfully.
Zeraora was also probably meant to fill the same role
    I mean, Zeraora just kind of...exists. The most it got was a role in a movie, but even that got overshadowed by everything else in it.
Zarude - Zandstorm
    Everytime I see it or it's name this is what I think followed by the song playing on loop in my head
    "Zarude is buffeted by the Zandstorm!"
A lot of recent mythics feel like that. A random event, "oh neat" then in the box it goes, never to be touched again.
Hopefully Pecharunt has a cool story at least.
    Yeah getting mythicals from random code distributions makes them very uneventful.
        Also them not having an event in-game is pretty boring.

Think back to Gen 3, 4 and 5 (for victini at least) where you generally got an item and had to go somewhere in the world to obtain the pokemon.

That made the encounter much more special than "Insert code, receive mon, maybe get a conversation, like with Diancie"
            Even most if not all of the other Unova mythicals had *something* for them.  Keldeo had the little clearing to get Resolute Form.  Meloetta had the guy in Castelia who would play the relic song.  Even Genesect at least had the scientist who would give the different drives.
                Meloetta also had an [event](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok√©mon_Global_Link_promotions#Musical_shows) related for Pok√©mon Musical feature although its separate from getting the mythical. 

This obscure event is the only time that a Mythical is implied to be owned by a trainer in the main series game outside of the protagonist.
            Spoilers for Indigo Disk DLC:

>!I LOVE THE MELOETTA ENCOUNTER FOR THIS EXACT REASON! It's such an insanely complex and nonsensical way to encounter a Pok√©mon, but the result is a genuinely exciting encounter that had me cackling like a child even though I looked up a guide to get it. My ONE complaint about this encounter is that I really don't think you can figure it out on your own. SV does not really encourage you to talk to random NPCs, so you'll probably never get the hints. And even if you do, they don't spell things out super clearly, so I think it's unlikely anyone will organically encounter Meloetta without the internet telling them she's out there. But man, what an amazing moment that would be. I wish all Mythicals were obtained like this.!<
        Heck if you‚Äôre going to gift them at least distribute them at lvl 10 or 20 so we can actually use them for a playthrough. Lvl 100 just ensures they‚Äôre never getting used
            The level 5 event Pokemon they briefly did were fucking rad. ORAS had a shiny Beldum with hold back (which is false swipe with a different name) so he was strong and good for catching. S&M followed that up with a munchlax with hold back, happy hour, metronome, and a Snorlax z-crystal. Z-Metronoming my way through the game was a blast.

More alt starters and less unique Pokemon with no substance pls, gamefreak.
        This is why I like the Meloetta event in the indigo disc

You spin around like the peroette form , then use the sepia filter as a reference to the og black and white event where the guy talks about his sepia colored dreams , feels very gen 3 esque imo
        The game won't even let you nickname them to make them feel personalized.
    Pecharunt is already more memorable for me just due to the sheer amount of theorizing people have done for it from the teal mask
    People have complained that a lot of recent mythicals‚Äô issues have been because there‚Äôs not much you have to do *in game* to get them - like, you don‚Äôt get to travel to a new area or anything, there‚Äôs just someone standing in the pokemon center to give them to you.

With that in mind, I wish that they would just change the modern idea of mythicals altogether, so that the DLC legendaries would be considered mythicals. It‚Äôs still technically content that isn‚Äôt accessible in the base game, that you have to download, so it *kinda* counts. It‚Äôs better than just adding some Pok√©mon you get with a code that no one will remember.
    Honestly this is why I feel like gen 5 were the last very memorable legendaries/mythics. It's because you can remember the events and cutscenes. I was so pissed when Diancie didnt get a special quest involving the sundial or the crystal cave.
    Most Mythics are like that in general, tbh. Download event ticket, go to a one-off map that's never going to get used again, fight and catch it like any other 'mon, and let it rot in the box. Maybe sprinkle in a line or two of dialogue if an NPC is involved.
    Mythics in the first five generations(except gen iii, jirachi and deoxys were very random, but the deoxys situation was somewhat fixed in the remakes) were linked to the lore in the region. After that, they just became dull.
There was a movie for it and everything but I think Zarude suffered from both the fact that primate Pok√©mon seem to get a mixed reception anyway and there‚Äôs already a grass primate as one of the starters in its own generation.
    There's also the fact that the movie plays against it's rarity and mythic status, by featuring a whole tribe of Zarudes
        I think it's somewhat plausible.

It is not rare in the sense that there are just very few specimen of it, but because they live so deep in the jungle that most humans will probably never encounter them in their entire life.
    And man, until you said this, I was getting Zarude mixed up with the electric anthro-cat mythical.
Zarudes problem was that it literally just doesn‚Äôt look mythical. It looks like a 3rd gen evo of a grass monkey.

Idk if that makes sense, but when I think of mythical Pok√©mon I think of either:

- cute/small/powerful like mew/jirachi/celebi/manaphy/shaymin/victini/marshadow

- or big/cool/edgy/unique like mewtwo/darkrai/crescelia/heatran/etc.

Zarude seems like he wants to be in the second category, but a mojo-jojo lookalike just doesn‚Äôt have that unique of a niche in that crowd.
    Now I can‚Äôt unsee Zarude as just an alternate timeline final evo of Grookey lol it def has that vibe
    it doesnt help that there is literally already a grass monkey in the very same game/generation, *and* its a starter w a similar colour scheme. its just kind of a weird choice.
    You named 3 non-mythicals. Heatran isn't mythical and I suspect you meant volcanion. Crescelia isn't mythical, maybe you were thinking of Genesect(?).

Mewtwo isn't mythical either.

The most important large mythical is Arceus.
    Lore wise, Zarude doesn‚Äôt seem mythical at all either. It‚Äôs been confirmed that multiple Zarude exist, so it‚Äôs not some one of a kind Pok√©mon like Mew, Celebi, Jirachi, etc. 

And it has the power of healing plants and forests, but that‚Äôs nothing new in the Pok√©mon world - even Meganium can heal plants back to life.
Genuinely not even sure what this is. I'll have to google it after this comment, lol.
I only remember how much of a shitshow that one distribution was. People weren‚Äôt getting their emails and then after a while support stopped giving out codes to people because they ‚Äúran out.‚Äù
Okay, but the Zarude movie was banging.
Mythicals are in a terrible spot. You can't use them in VGC, or battle tower (when it actually exists), and their release is ass. Most people will have already become champion, or its level is too high for their current progress. The only thing truely special about them is their rarity.
Same with Zeraora‚Ä¶ no one remembers that thing.
So many mythical tbh. Diancie, Magearna, Zeraora‚Ä¶
My brother loved that Pok√©mon! It was all over the Pok√©mon bed sheets and in merch back in the 90‚Äôs
It definitely got a lot of attention for being 000 *and* being really useable in the story if the Liberty Pass was obtained.

But then the first one turned into footnotes for wiki pages once the new factor wore off, while nothing was ever done with it again outside the movies, which every mythical was getting.

EDIT: Unova was not the first generation with four mythicals. Forgot about Manaphy.
> BW released and being the 1st pokemon in the BW pokedex for some reason.

Okay so the reason it was #000 was purely a mechanical reason. You got it *really* early on in the game. Since your Pokedex in Gen 5 goes as far as the furthest seen and/or caught Pokemon is, if it were at the *end* of the Unovan dex, the moment you caught it you'd like all of the Regional Unova dex pages unlocked and just showing ??? and that would be a huge hassle. So they made it #000 and decided to make a big deal out of it.
I actually got Victini, and while it was cool to have him at the start of my playthrough...idk, he just didn't really click.
Black and white kinda killed the idea of fun mythicals. Everyone sites the fact that you just kinda get the mythicals now but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the only part. I think the biggest part was how they gave you just a little taste of information in the base game to start rumors like the new journals in RBY or the kid having nightmares in Canalave city or the books talking about the origin of Pok√©mon in the libraries in DPPT. They also used to thematically fit in with the region, like kanto has a lot of themes of man vs nature so mew as a counterpart to mewtwo fits the region, Johto has a theme of purity and tradition so celebi fits there, Hoenn has the space station and the mythicals are from space, sinnoh has themes of origin mythology and pantheons so all the mythicals are gods of certain aspects of the world, then Unova started the theme of mythicals just being rare Pok√©mon, like meloetta could be from any region, Victini is just the victory Pok√©mon numbered 0 no one in the game talks about it, there‚Äôs no explanation why it‚Äôs #0, no extra events for catching it, it doesn‚Äôt really fit in with the rest of gen V, and every mythical after that has the same problem, like what makes Magearna so special? Think about how much you could say about Arceus vs something like Zarude or Zeraora.
To be fair that was just massive self sabotage considering how stupid the method to get one is in BW1, and the fact that the only way to get one in BW2 is N's Zorua.
    Now that you mention it, I do remember when I was playing, I really did want one but was massively disappointed when there was no way to catch a Zorua. Now I don't think of Zoroark at all.
        Exactly - it wasn‚Äôt able to be obtained despite my looking for it and wanting to catch it. It wasn‚Äôt findable so it couldn‚Äôt be ‚Äúpart of the team‚Äù and get good memories
            They fixed that by having it on Route 1 in Ultra Sun/Moon with a 30% encounter rate in this one patch of grass. That was my second main line Pok√©mon game, and I had a Zorua on my team and fell in love with it.
    Needing to transfer either an event Celebi from HGSS for Zorua, or an event shiny Johto Beast from DPPt for Zoroark, is an infuriatingly idiotic requirement for getting Pok√©mon featured in a *movie*
    make it a free gift egg in BW1 and easy profit
        Worked for Volcarona, that seems fairly popular (obviously not to the levels of Lucario, Charizard and Greninja).
            But Volcarona only worked once. Now you have to get a Larvesta and level it up like insane to get a Volcarona.
                I like to call that Gen 5 syndrome. (Seriously, level 59 for volcarona and 64 for hydreigon??)
                Volcarona can be obtained at level 35 in the mid game in BW2 but that‚Äôs an exception.
        They already did it first with Riolu in gen 4, why they didn't try it again in gen 5?
            Heck, they give you a free Mega Lucario in gen 6
                It's funny how both XY and ORAS just gives you a free mega relatively early on

Yes I'm sure giving me a mega evolution when 90% of the game involves fights with mega-less trainers is a good idea lmao
        They did this actually...in japan...I had a Japanese copy of white and was able to grab and raise it in game and then breed it and send an egg to an English copy of black once that came out!
            Thing is, a lot of people dont live in japan, thus not having access to japenese events, especially the kids that lived outside of japan. 
This is my biggest gripe with gamefreak, they run a bunch of really cool events within japan, shiny this, mythical that, and then just ignore the rest of the world when theres a decent playerbase everwhere else
    bw1 is especially bad for this like u can‚Äôt catch fuckall until like 3 gyms in then u still gotta wait until like the e4 or post game to get a heap of mons cos they‚Äôre either rlly late game or they level up so late there‚Äôs no point
        [deleted]
            yeah rufflet or vullaby evolving around 50 is pretty bad in bw when get them after like 7th gym in mid to high 30's, but its far worse when find them early game in later games
            The real problem is that they actually had a good level curve and wanted you to have some time with the base versions before they evolve, at least for the birds and Deino, Larveresta has no excuse, they probably should have just been available to find earlier into the region, like do something like open up Marvelous Bridge but keep the version city closed around Driftveil and make them available there
    Same thing for Milotic. It's still quite popular, because it's a beautiful pokemon indeed, but the fact that very few players got it, specially before beating the Elite4, must have hindered its popularity a lot
        I think this is part of why I love Milotic so much. I was that kid who spent eight hours straight hunting for a Feebas and then had a Milotic on my team during the story play. It made me a legend amongst my friends and Pok√©mon-playing peers, especially since I bred her and had multiple Milotic (and traded some Feebas for legendaries). I still have that first Milotic and she's still in Sapphire. :)
        ORAS did it right giving Feebas a fixed tile to find it
    Not to mention battle preview ruin any chance of him being viable outside of playthrough.
        Would disagree a bit with this point. Especially since the introduction of H-Zoroark into VGC. Although, I do wish there was no preview that would also mean an enormous uptick in Zoroark usage 

And it actually messes with ppls head (or not at all) when they see H-Zoroark in preview. I‚Äôll elaborate - players either do 1 or 2 things when they see Zoroark in my party 

1) Completely ignore or forget Zoroark was in my party which allows Zoroark additional turn(s) to either support or setup 

2) Over prepare or over analyze. (This involves switching a mon out or using a dark move when it would normally be ‚Äúnot very effective‚Äù)

Scenario #1 is far more common. Ppl very often just ignore or forget about Zoroark and still use fake out, close combat, drain punch, shadow ball (any normal, fighting, ghost type moves). Which ofc, H-Zoroark is immune to. 

H-Zoroark biggest strength in my party is still the element of surprise mostly bc ppl just don‚Äôt see him as a threat or get too caught up in several other strategies that are possible with my team and far more common in the VGC (and I do sometimes still use those strategies)

I‚Äôve never took a shot at regional or anything but every season I would make into a decent standing in Master Rank and always have an over .500 record. Certainly not in the top 100 every season but I‚Äôve gotten close and would say I‚Äôm at least capable
            Zoroark isn‚Äôt really a thing in vgc except for meme teams tbh. Even with illusion, it‚Äôs just not that good. You can def have fun with it on ladder and probably take it to some locals, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ever had any decent placements at higher level events. 

The meta is so hyper offensive that even resisted and neutral hits are removing it from the field.
    I think of Hisuian Zoroark before I do normal Zoroark to be honest. Zorua and Zoroark were cool for like 5 minutes back when Black/White launched, then we found out it couldn't be obtained outside a one off event and everybody just lost all interest.

Things like that are large part of why I hate that time limited events with exclusive pokemon are still a thing, anyone that misses the event is just screwed forever unless the event repeats at some point, and even then they can still be screwed if said event is in the next gen.
        Me when I missed Iron Leaves and Walking Wake with no promise of getting them again:
            Bruh theyre in tera raids rn.
In BW it was held back that you need a Celebi or shiny Legendary Beasts released to tie in with the Zoroark movie. Even more so the way to bring them over to trigger the event flag was quite obscure (it involves the Relocator, the Pokemon Transfer Lab does not work to activate the event).
Its so stupid they made it event-locked which made most people think its a mythical instead of making it obtainable during playthrough. I hope the eventual remakes should make it free from event-locked

Also I wish it should've have mega instead of stupid Audino but it got its Hisuian form and megas are no longer around, so it doesn't matter anymore.
I feel like Zoroark is pretty popular tho. It‚Äôs my second favorite Pok√©mon
    Yeah. In the 2020 poll it came 23rd. While obviously not as good as Lucario being in 2nd, I would find it  hard to call any Pokemon in the top 50 not very popular Pokemon
    It's popularity has definitely risen in the past decade since it's debut, but it'll never reach the levels of Lucario, whose my second favorite Pokemon.
It could of been gen 5s Lucario if they didn't lock it behind events in BW so we could use it on our team
I like Zoroark. One of my favorite Pokemon designs/ concepts. But honestly it's pretty terrible. It's built purely as a sweeper. Which is great, but because it's so frail, it's ability is borderline useless. It's pretty much perpetually at 1 or 2 hits from being KOed. 

The Hisuian one improves slightly by having a more defensive typing, but is still frail.
When it was introduced, the way it had a movie about it... I genuinely thought it was intended as a legendary or at least a mythical.
I always found that, namewise, Liepard would've been better for having those kinds of powers. I mean it's a pok√©mon that's lying about who they are.
I always thought Psyduck was her mascot until Togepi came along
    I honestly remember Misty more for Psyduck (the comic relief that she would keep bringing out by accident but who was secretly very powerful), Togepi (the baby of the bunch), Staryu (her actual only competent Pok√©mon), and Goldeen (who was never useful except in the water) than I do her Horsea (as I cannot recall what Horsea's running gag was).
        Horsea was the small weak one that was actually smart. it got kidnapped once and used its Spitting ink to create a trail for the characters to follow if I remember correctly
            Pokemon was always a kids show, but reading this it's nice to remember how every Pokemon was unique, they all had their quarks, personality and attitude.
            Yep in the Eevolutions episode
        Staryu was the best. HYAH!
        You completely missed her Starmie which she typically reserved for utility rather than battle.  She had a powerful 'mon in her pocket most of the time though.
            I forgot she had both a Starmie AND a Staryu on her team.
        Starmie in the corner here thinking "fine guess I'll just leave then".

No but for real, it always seemed like her Staryu was stronger from what I remember, which is pretty weird
    Psyduck isn‚Äôt necessarily her mascot‚Ä¶ but it has gags, which kind of make it memorable. Like, it kind of reminds me of James‚Äô Victreebell, even when Weezing is his real mascot.
        I'd probably say Psyduck could be considered her mascot, at least up until Togepi arrives, due to it being so memorable for her. I suppose you could also argue it was her most powerful pokemon, it's just neither of them knew how to use that power at will. 

I always kind of saw Psyduck as a bit of a metaphor for Misty. Has a headache most of the time (both Psyduck and Ash gave Misty "headaches"), can have temper/rage outbursts, lives in the shadow of her more talented sisters (Psyduck and Misty's other pokemon), has untapped potential and strength and comes up clutch when needed and/or is least expected. I may have read too much into it all, but Psyduck seemed the perfect fit to me as her mascot or "pal" pokemon, with her ace, then, probably being Starmie.
        Downfall is that Psyduvk's gag became stale fast and overshadowed her other Pokemon.

Oh she's gonna send out Starmie? Wrong, Psyduck.

Oh no Psyduck is massively outmatched? Jokes on you every time the opponent will play into the gag of hitting it until the headache power activates.
    To be fair i remember all of her pokemon vividly
Horsea is super underrated in terms of cuteness. That thing is adorable. 

I mainly think of Psyduck when I think of anime Misty.
Horsea and Corsola had big deals made around them with Misty wanting them, then they proceed to do nothing and never appear so Psyduck can pop out instead.
For some reason I think of her Staryu more than Togepi. Either way, both were more popular than Horsea.
I feel like I‚Äôm the only person who always loved Mr. Mime as a kid
    Honestly he's kind of crazy in RBY. Abra doesn't require much investment to get to Kadabra and start destroying everything, but you can do even less work and trade for Mr. Mime to IMMEDIATELY destroy everything. The boosted EXP also helps him level faster and stay strong. Honestly a top-tier in-game Pok√©mon.
>Dahlia‚Äôs signature mon 

Assuming you‚Äôre referring to Ash‚Äôs mom and not the Arcade Star, her name is spelled ‚ÄúDelia‚Äù.
As a followup to this-

Marill was designed to be a followup to Pikachu, a cute easy to draw elemental mouse with a zigzag tail and a single evolution, featured all the early Johto promos. Marill is the \*real\* Pikaclone of gen 2 before the concept was solidified (and it makes more sense with Johto being supplementary to Kanto, while Hoenn was more a 'reboot' which solidified the formula back to RBY) and doesn't even get recognized as it
    For those who weren‚Äôt Pokefans before Gen 2‚Äôs release, there was so much Mythos out there about Marill, or ‚ÄúPikablu‚Äù as some called it.
        I remember those days. "Leaks" of PIKABLU and Ho-Oh. 

Looking for Mew under the truck for the umpteenth time. 

Watching ripped Japanese scenes of the Pokemon Mewtwo Movie.
            I remember the insane arguments about the weird looking Moltres in the anime lmao.
                In my circles it was well accepted that the Pokemon missing from the dex in the first episode of the anime was in fact Missing it's Number, thus Ho Oh is forever Missingno to me
            The Mew Truck thing sounded plausible if not likely.

The actual way to force a Mew spawn with the RNG and things like Nugget Bridge sounded like absolute bullshit but actually worked by gaming the coding lol
                I was convinced the keys in the game corner was connected to the truck to get mew as a kid. 


Now I know that the keys on a machine just means you went to crap and no one take my spot
            Ho-oh was in the first episode of the anime, too. They had years of plans already and probably just enjoyed watching Gen I squirm
        It would've been so cool if they kept doing differently typed Pikaclones instead of clogging up the electric type with the same mon every gen
            Especially since a bunch are single evos. I‚Äôd be okay if we had another couple fully evolved lines of electric rodent.
                Like the Pawmi line, which is my favorite pika-clone in part because you can actually use them.
                    I'm meh on the design but it's a neat typing and a neat concept.

However, it's also the only one where I agree that the evolution stages look way too similar, but that could be made worse by its debut in Paldea where it's a lot easier to mix up smaller 'mons.
        the pikablu days were good days, so much excitement and hype!
        The pok√©gods...
        Even the trading cards for the first movie called it Pikablu. Also Snubull was Buru.
            That's probably worth a pretty penny now
    It will forever make me sad that instead of getting a creatively designed rodent of a different element each generation, we get repeated electric rodents that all look borderline identical.

It‚Äôs like when a movie is successful, and they focus on all the wrong parts for the sequel
        It‚Äôs probably *because* of Marill‚Äôs unpopularity that they returned to Electric.
    I wish they would have stuck with the elemental mouse concept for pikachu clones. The first few pikaclones are just electric mice with weird mechanics, and even when they started adding extra types you could still mostly count on electric as one of the types. 

I wish they had it where each gen gets it's own elemental mouse, kinda like eeveelutions. Would make the concept more interesting avd give the different pikaclones different niches
I feel like morpeko was the biggest example though. Marnie uses it, it's got a signature move and ability, looks similar, has the hunger switch gimmick
    I still don't know what the hunger switch does for Morpeko
        Changes the type of its signature move. When its full belly its electric type and when its hungry its dark type
            Ohhh thank you! I wanted to use Morpeko in my team in sword at one point but the constant switch made the battles take too long. So I just switched it out. Never noticed type change on its move.
Mimikyu is the exception mainly because it play hard into being that with its own story behind it.
    Mimikyu isn‚Äôt an exception because it‚Äôs not considered as an electric type Pikachu clone. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs interesting lol. Togedamaru is the one for Gen 7 instead.
    Alola also has Togedemaru
    Mimkyu is not a pikaclone.
Do they? Gen 2 and 3's introduce machanics (breeding and double battles), Gen 4 and 5's Pachirisu and Emolga are perfectly popular. Gen 6's Dedenne shows off Fairy-type. Gen 7's definitely a miss if we dont include Mimikyu, and so's the next but at least Gen 8's Morpeko at least has a unique gimmick. And Gen 9's Pawmot is just a straight up normal Pokemon that is actually very well received by the community. Even Raichu, the black sheep of the family got an Alolan form that was super well liked. So whilst yeah theres some misses, overall Id say the electric rodents are actually good Pokemon and should stay something GameFreak does
    Yeah it's not how I meant it. More like, they should have been even more popular, be the mascot of each gen just like Pikachu have been. 
It's just how I feel about them anyway
Nah, Pikaclones are great and I think they understand they will never be that popular.
I personally like the pawmi line, because it doesn't really look like a pikachu clone...
Some of them are really cool. Pawmot became one of my favorites when i played through SV
Is that why you think they‚Äôve been withholding them from us since the 3DS?
    Also because they're quite superfluous when every single game has Eevee in it.
        Eevee wasn‚Äôt available in Black and White, the monkeys‚Äô debut games.
            Which only aupports the notion that they monkeys were there to fill that gap, but since Eevee is in every game since BW, the monkeys are surplus to requirements.
I like them quite a lot and am sad to not be able to ever use them.
Hisui-Zoroark made me love it in a way regular failed
I feel like it worked, every single one of my friends was obsessed with Zorua and Zoroark when BW came out
Shouldn't have made it stupidly rare in those games.
I think Zoroark is very popular with TCG players. Zoroark was very dominant in the TCG for a very long time, Zoroark GX in particular. It worked with a plethora of different partners and strategies, however, not in an oppressive but rather in an enabling way, so most players have fond memories of it.
\#PorygonDidNothingWrong
    It was Pikachu‚Äôs fault. Ban Pikachu.
The history behind Porygon is cool. Satoshi Tajiri was told making a sprite game was a waste of time since 3D graphics were getting better and that no one would be interested in their game. So he designed a 3D polygon Pokemon in a 2D sprite to be tongue in cheek.
    Now they need to design a 2D Pok√©mon to be in a 3D game to come full circle
It‚Äôs so annoying too because they gave it TWO more evolutions and they NEVER appear in ANYTHING! there‚Äôs zero mythos or lore outside of gathering some small context clues in DPPt that show porygon-Z was probably created by team Galactic.

Like they‚Äôre all such cool pokemon, I wish they got some exposure.
    I know right?!

I think Porygon would be great inside a Pok√©dex like Rotom

Or rotom and Porygon could make a great duo!

The Porygon line is so underutilized
I've always thought it was odd that Rotom is in pokedexes instead of Porygon, it would make a lot more sense with porygon. Porygon is literally a digital pokemon, it can be a digital assistant. Rotom's an electric ghost, it can... power the phone? Power was never an issue to begin with in the games.

Come to think of it, in sword/shield and scarlet/violet, does the phone having a rotom even add anything? In sun and moon it was cool because the Rotom was it's own character, but past that they're... just there. With Porygon, it would make sense, a digital assistant is there to help, not be your friend, but rotom isn't a digital assistant, it's a ghost, it should have personality.
Boltund in particular is a real interesting one because I think it's one of the few instances where a Dog Pok√©mon has just not been popular
    He should have been a bigger Yamper imo
        Exactly, I love yamper (I have a corgi IRL) but Bolthund is the most generic uninteresting dog Pok√©mon ever conceived
            I love Boltund personally (It's a dog so of course I will), but it's design is definitely just too generic dog to be more popular. Probably would've been smarter to just continue the corgi theme, especially since the breed is super popular nowadays (I had two when I was a kid).
                Bolthund always felt like it was trying to invoke a greyhound, which makes me wonder if historically dog racing was a thing in the inspiring region from real world or the in game region.

Edit: or just general foxhounds which when I looked them up were so painfully generic they look like what I would put as the ‚Äúdog‚Äù picture in a dictionary‚Ä¶ /smh
            I went into Sword and Shield without knowing too much about the game so I was so excited to catch Yamper. And then I evolved it and I boxed it. I was heartbroken üòü I was expecting it to stay a corgi and I was so let down!
        yeah it should‚Äôve stayed a corgi or like evolved into a sheepdog looking dog instead also bolthund looks like weirdly bald idk not a fan of him as much as i love yamper
            Let's not forget the complete stat change on evolution either.  Yamper starts off with like, 29 base speed and then hits 121 on evolution.  You get this funny chonky corgi who seems like he'll be a bulky electric wall who ends up evolving into a completely separate dog breed that's a speed demon.

The juxtaposition between the two ideas is just jarring, especially on an animal that most people have a strong familiarity with.  We know dog breeds are distinct and different, and we saw a corgi then wanted a corgi.  But it evolves and essentially becomes a whole new concept unrelated to its base beyond "dog".

Yamper sucks because he's an example of one of the worst outcomes of evolution: becoming something so completely different or unexpected that the player gets disappointed since they liked the original idea.  It's not like Bug types either - we all know caterpillars become butterflies, so when Caterpie evolves we're already fully on board to see that drastic change.

No one was expecting that from not only a dog, but a dog breed that's so iconic to the region the game took inspiration from.
                yeah like there‚Äôs lots of british dogs they could‚Äôve used but bolthund is like just generic dog it doesn‚Äôt seem like any breed particularly also maybe it‚Äôs in the dex or smth idk but yamper and its evo should‚Äôve had some sorta rivalry with wololo since corgis are sheepdogs and farm shit like that is pretty big in the uk also ur right it should‚Äôve kept bulky and used a shetland sheepdog as a base like it could‚Äôve used its fur to hold electricity and shock anyone that tried to attack (lore wise good excuse to give it high defence) i feel like dog mons get done kinda dirty like cat mons are usually really well designed

https://preview.redd.it/876jkwlpbg8c1.jpeg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e5957823ee8b398c5f8cd495ca80cd9f7aaee4fb
                    What are you talking about, Boltund's clearly a greyhound.
                    I love the idea of a Sheltie Yamper evo! It feels like a much more natural progression both in visuals and inspirations.
            Its because bolthund is a super hero and the fox thing was the villian. They both look idiotic because mascot concept look trumps generally interesting design.
                ohhh that makes a little more sense i liked the fox a lot thought tbh it felt like an old school pokemon
                    Nicket is adorable. The second form looks dumb
yamper and wooloo were big when they were announced. wooloo‚Äôs hype just died down and yamper gets ugly after evolving
Personally, I was never a big fan of Zeraora, and while Zoroark never got nearly as popular as Lucario, I personally think that it does a much better job standing apart from Zeraora in that department.
    To be fair i dont really like lucario zoroark zeraora esque type of pokemon so to me so i really put them real low
At least Zoroark reads as its own thing. Zeraora just feels like bargain bin Lucario.
    Definitely.

Zeraora being mythical has no rhyme nor reason.
Its not even a pokemon you get to use in a playthrough since its mythical status.

Like, imagine Zeraora as an in game mon with a prevo(maybe even evo?) I dont think itll be as bad.

Heck its a feline right? Not sure why didnt they just do a tiny electric cat pokemon as a prevo and make it a mon...
        It was just randomly added to Ultra Sun and Moon. The only memorable thing about it was that shiny event in Generation 8.

Despite that, Zarude is probably the Mythical that is the least memorable outside of Phione.
            At least Zarude has that dumb alternate form, but the competition between those two as most unnecessary mythical is still a close competition.
            The randomness of when it came out. It felt like everyone was already moving on from US/UM, and then they just throw this mythical out there like "hey, we forgot we had this thing, so, ugh, here you go."

It's like the exact opposite of Zygarde, where they built up this big thing that everyone thought would lead to a game version Pokemon Z, but they said "haha, Sike. Wait until next Gen so we can shoehorn Zygarde lore in there since we are ~~too lazy to make~~ going to surprise everyone by not making a Z version."
                I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the 20th anniversary is why the developers didn‚Äôt make Pokemon Z.
            Phione/Manaphy and Zeraora also should have been dual typed. Electric fists? If it was our first electric fighting it would have at least that going for it.
Also Azumarill gets fairy typing but Manaphy doesn't??
                GF seems dislike adding new type to legenday/mythical Pokemon.
                    Volcanion is the only water/fire Pokemon though
                        I think they were referring to the fact that they would‚Äôve had to have added fairy type to manaphy retroactively. There‚Äôs several Gen 1-5 mythicals that gamefreak could have believably added fairy type to, and they didn‚Äôt add it to any of them - so it seems like they made a conscious decision that they *weren‚Äôt* going to do that.
        Mythicals are way overdone. I think there should be a max of 2 per region (and it's really best to go with just 1). Zeraora also doesn't look mythical to me. It looks great (I actually like its design more than Lucario's), but the second I learned it was mythical... meh, lost interest.
            I liked mythicals when they have like... you know, reasoning for being one.



Zeraora and Volcanion dont have reasons on what they are. They just exist. 

Its not like Magearna or Diancie whos a manmade creation or a mutation.

Nor like Marshadow whos the rainbow feather guardian.
    I like Zeraora, but it kind of feels like someone's Sonic the Hedgehog OC.
Zeraora gives off this Digimon reject pile vibe.
    OUCH
I like Zeraora, but never had a chance to obtain it, so... <shrugs>
At first, I thought "Zeraora" was you mispelling Zorua somehow, if that tells you how little people care/know about/remember that weird cat thing. 

Very much dislike it myself, to be honest.
Ngl totally forgot zeraora was even a thing until Pokemon unite came out lmao
The Nidos (generally Nidoking) are really popular in Kanto though. Especially for speed runners.
    That‚Äôs nice, I really like them. I think they look the way Satoshi Taijiri first imagined most of Pokemon looking like, kaiju-types mixed with animals. I always have a Nidoking in my team if present in the game :)!
    It's pretty crazy to think that you can get a 3rd stage Mon with good stats before the second gym
        That grows fast and can learn almost everything. And looks awesome!
Ahhhh, I do love to have a Nido in my party, especially early in the game, so I guess it worked on me
    It worked on me too, I‚Äôm a Nidoran fan since 1998 and will keep being one :)! I was hoping they would come back with the DLC but got really dissapointed :(.
Mimikyu at least acknowledges the thing it tries to copy. Plus it has a really strange charm to it that I think resonates with a lot of people.
I honestly don't know why they keep making these. I haven't remembered a single one since Plusle and Minun, since at least they had the memorable feature of being twins and featuring in double battles. Seems like a waste since everyone would just use Pikachu given the chance and I can't imagine anyone needs an electric rodent that bad if Pikachu isn't around.

What happened with Pachirisu?
    It‚Äôs tradition at this point. I doubt they even care about the Pika-clones being popular anymore, it‚Äôs just something that every region needs to feel complete, alongside the birds, rt. 1 normal types, and one or two bug lines. It would feel weird if they excluded them.
    Pachirisu was used to win worlds as a super underground niche pick which got it a decent amount of fame as the face of ‚Äòunderdog‚Äô pokemon / playing with your favourite (even though the player didn‚Äôt care much for pachirisu aside from its unique capabilities until after the win)
Mimikyu probably would‚Äôve completely upstaged Togedemaru if not for the anime.
Poor guy never even got a sandstorm form
    Because otherwise it wouldn't be able to add weather ball to its moveset.

You would have to get rid of one of the weather moves to include sandstorm instead and that would still lock you out of one of its transformations.

Also, I think the real purpose with castform was to show how prominent were weathers as a mechanic when gen 3 came out. 

And it certainly worked. Everyone paid attention to the addition of weathers thanks to castform.
        >Because otherwise it wouldn't be able to add weather ball to its moveset. You would have to get rid of one of the weather moves to include sandstorm instead and that would still lock you out of one of its transformations.
 
Can you elaborate? My brain is having a hard time understanding why this wouldn't work.
            Sunny Day, Rain Dance, Hail, Weather Ball. That fills all four move slots. So if he had a Sandstorm form, you‚Äôd have to give up on one of the other three forms or your only attacking move.
                Or the trainer could just pick which weather moves to have on it at any given time‚Ä¶
        My Castform‚Äôs four moves were Sunny Day, Flamethrower, Weather Ball, and Thunderbolt, so the 4-move argument literally doesn‚Äôt hold water for me‚Ä¶
I don't think it was really meant to be popular, it was more of a experiment by GF since it was the first (and on gen 3, the only) pok√©mon to be able to change forms.
    Deoxys was also able to change forms, albeit not during battle.
Poor Mikey...
>It also has a unique typing and signature move

I don't think that means that it was meant to be popular since most pok√©mon this gen have either a signature ability or signature move (or both, like Espathra, Glimmora, etc) and a lot of pok√©mon have unique or just not common typings
Yea but that ability is so garbage, giving it to anymon would make it less popula. 
regigigus would do better with turant
    I know it‚Äôs bad, I was just pointing it out because it‚Äôs very unique. Even though slow start is bad it was still a legendary signature ability
>They even gave Varoom Slow Start

I mean, it‚Äôs a hidden ability, so you really have to go out of your way to get it. Also, it turns into Filter after evolving. Objectively a better upgrade than what Wimpod got‚Ä¶
Interesting‚Äîit‚Äôs honestly one of my favorites of the paldea pokemon! But I can understand why not everyone likes it.
Rule #1 for a Pokemon to be popular - people have to like looking at it. Sorry Revaroom.
"They were intended to be parallels of¬†Kanto's¬†Clefairy¬†and¬†Clefable; Pok√©mon that everyone would think was cute." -Bulbapedia citing Nintendo Dream

And they were used during the "welcome to the world of Pokemon" intro sequence, so Game Freak was definitely hoping it would leave a good impression.
i love that line it rlly feels like a line that ur in game mum wud have it‚Äôs also busted in story playthroughs lol i feel like a lotta gen 5 mons suffer from them making it like a semi reboot cos a lotta the pokemon in it end up just less cool versions of older mons but the original unique ones are like amazing like look at bisharp, reuinaclus, gothita line and the legends are easily some of the coolest
One of my year 8s mentioned this year that Mincinno was his favourite Pokemon.

Thought that was an odd choice, goes to show the old adage of every Pokemon is someones favourite
The expression is ‚Äúplaying field‚Äù btw
    Is this a r/boneappletea in the wild??
    U/bobsplosion mentioned an even ‚Äúplaying field‚Äù. This is actually a zoning issue.
        r/unexpectedoffice
Hey, at least he got his own TV special, some legendaries have even less
    But Entei and Suicune featured in the third and fourth movies, adding heavily to their mystique; if the pattern had followed, the fifth film could have featured Raikou but instead it was about the upcoming Gen 3 legendaries Latios and Latias‚Äîand besides it being one of my favorite Pok√©mon movies, it does still feel like a missed opportunity.
suicune was their top dog (top cat?) from day 1 tho, it became a cover legendary despite having no role in crystal‚Äôs plot line and Goh captured one in the anime
    Suicune did have the storyline in Crystal with Eusine chasing it, you get the Clear Bell as well from the radio tower director as well that triggers the event for it.
    Suicune had an entire game with it on the cover while Entei had the third movie. Raikou was screwed over from before even the GBA.
raikous been my favorite pokemon since i was a kid <3 so happy it‚Äôs catchable in sv indigo disk
Raikou not having a trainer doesn't help its case. Suicune had Eusine and Goh while Entei had the frontier brain girl. Raikou being alone makes its appearances limited to random occurence in stories
Especially in the movie I Choose You. Entei and Suicune got whole ass scenes dedicated to them while Raikou just gets a fleeting cameo.
You might be right. They were kind of a second starter in BW, but imo, they were like a dollar store version of a starter. Much weaker, much more boring (just generic monkeys that happen to have elemental powers), and used too much (used in a gym, given as a gift, and I feel like they were VERY prevalent in Kalos' early game). I think all this contributed to them being super UNpopular. If they were just a rare(ish) encounter found in Pinwheel Forest after the gym, and that's where their prevalence ended, I think they'd be... slightly less hated.

They aren't even the best choice to use against that first gym imo. Lillipup will generally do the job faster (that thing hits like truck in the early game).
Pansage, Pansear, Panpour

Simisage, Simisear, Simipour
I said it elsewhere in the thread but I have a hunch that monkey Pok√©mon are a hard sell. Too close to humanoid maybe. Grookie being a slight exception because his fellow starters‚Äô final evolutions are awful looking. But like gen 4 had a monkey starter and it‚Äôs the least popular by a significant amount.
    Infernape is definitely not liked or disliked by any significant amount compared to torterra and empoleon. And humanoid pokemon have been a thing since Gen 1, machop and hitmon lines are popular. I don't think monkeys are worse off
    Too human made me think of Mr mime immediately, seriously catching a Mr mime is enslavement Smdh
I only ever think of that one [comic](https://twitter.com/JHallComics/status/1159177176413028352?t=OSB0LNQPKANPYGI6xZoziw&s=19) about how Morpeko was designed by a focus group to appeal to millenials.

"I get hangry without my avocado toast! It has pockets!"
I love morpeko. And Iove that it's based on the idea of Dr. Jekill and Mr. Hyde (that's why it's a guinea pig, because in the story Dr. Jekill uses himself as a "guinea pig" for his experiment and ends up with two personalities". 

Every single pokemon in Galar has some kind of british related inspiration and that is why Morpeko is part of Galar (the protagonist of the story is British).
    A shame the mode switch does next to nothing.  Would've been neat if it altered stats but no it just changes the typing of one move and that's it.
I had to look him up
I love Morpeko! But I agree. Even though it was the ace of one of your rivals in Galar it doesn‚Äôt feel like it really stuck around in popularity. Think it could have used an evolution (Moraichu maybe? :p). I think unevolving pokemon often are less popular.
I think everybody knowing that this was going to happen was part of the meme.
They were trying hard to make lechonk the next bidoof but it didn't work.
Small Raichu
Unironically my favorite Pok√©mon ‚ù§Ô∏è
> Gen 7 began decidueye was clearly the fan favorite

Incineroar is just incapable of not being talked about however just because of the sheer dominance it had on the competitive scene.
    Yeah I mentioned that in my post, it's crazy how everytime its available it becomes obligatory in most teams
I think Incineroar failed to gain popularity because the line looked to be going for a quadruped tiger vibe then out of nowhere you get a professional wrestler? I remember so many people being pissed off by Incineroar because they felt let down by the final evolution.
Cinderance design is just ugly imo. Incineroar I can teeter on the fence with liking or thinking it's cool at least. Idk the last few Gen I feel like the starters are extremely forgetable and unamusing
[removed]
    With spoons for hands.
Actually no , Audino is a rare case of a pokemon specifically made for the anime ( like Lugia and Jirachi ) , since Unova was supposed to be a reboot for the series , they thought that when the anime comes out it'll be weird for Nurse Joy to have Chansey on her in Unova so the designers were told to make a Chansey counterpart and thats how Audino was created
    It‚Äôs weird when you look at Gen 5 Pokemon and so many of them are basically direct copies of Gen 1 mons. Not saying they all are but seriously they created a copy of Tauros, Chansey, Hitmonlee and Hitmonchan, etc. They have a geodude copy and even a Hypno copy with Musharna.
And instead we all just beat up the fat sack of shit for EXP.
    a poor man's Chansey
The mythicals in general are such a missed opportunity.  Many of the designs are great but they‚Äôre such a pain to obtain and then they don‚Äôt serve much of a purpose in-game even if you do jump through the hoops to get them.
Zeraora?
Zerarora is awesome.
If I didn't occasionally roll it in randbats I would completely forget this thing exists
I'm pretty sure Sawk & Throh intentionally were going for Hitmon-vibes knowing that gen 5 was attempting to soft reboot the franchise. There's also more obvious comparisons like Bouffalant/Tauros, the Roggenrola/Geodude lines, & Machop/Timburr lines.
    And Chansey/Audino
They originally had a horned oni/ogre theme but they sanded it away before release to just be generic humanoids. What a weird choice, would have at least made them visually unique
All i see when i look at those two guys is bog-standard uninspired fighting types. Really unsure how they made the cut. No secondary type, no gimmick, design is literally blue/red martial artist but it's made of polygons. Idk, big failure as a whole
It‚Äôs like the whole ‚ÄúCharizard is overrated‚Äù nonsense being repeated ad nauseum to the point that it‚Äôs no longer accurate.
Right? I mean, I absolutely agree that gamefreak tried to make it the new Lucario and that it isn't quite on that level of popularity. But it's still massively popular is what I thought.  
I personally love it, much more so than Lucario. I was so happy when in BW2 you were finally able to get one. I use it on every single Black 2 run I'm doing.
    I'm of the same mind, mostly. I don't feel like they 'failed'... Just that B/W and Gen 5 was very hit/miss for people... And, I might be bold in saying this, I don't know a person IRL that grew up with or has played Gen 5 that likes Lucario *more* than Zoroark...
The fact everyone is saying it kinda shows how popular it is
People saying Zoroark isn't as popular because they aren't Lucario, is like saying that Lance is not a popular champion because he's not Cynthia.
Bro, Swampert that is basically the best starter (based on stats and type combination) and a literal starter, was literally ignored, like it barely appeared in the anime, and was a literal starter
Its hands are fucking terrifying‚Ä¶
Cinderace is popular though, lots of merchandise and different TCG-cards of it, it's just the "Ermahgerd!  It's just a guy in a fursuit!"-brigade (The anti-humanoid-pokemon lot) that makes it seem disliked.
    Fair point, though it's still nowhere near as popular as Charizard or Greninja, even though GF probably intended it to be as popular.
Yeah I remember seeing it all over the place when Gen 2 was coming out
    It was the second gen 2 Pok√©mon seen after Togepi. When we met Tracy in the orange islands he had a Maril and it was a big deal at the time. Never took off in the same popularity though. Sad, it was a good design
        Ho-oh was in the first ep so Marill is actually third then.
Don't forget about the stupidity that is Gimmighouls' Roaming Form.

We can catch up to legendary Pokemon running at high speeds, but can't catch a tiny coin gremlin. Nevermind it wouldn't even be worth using if we could get it normally anyway, since it evolves into the exact same thing.
    I have a ton of them if you want one. They made them Pokemon Go exclusive like Meltan.

I've just been passing them out in Home through wonder trade.
    I genuinely felt so disappointed when I learned that roaming Gimmighoul evolves into Gholdengo the same as the regular forms. I don't know what I would've expected, but it definitely feels like a letdown that there's literally nothing special about them at all
At least it's both famous and infamous in competitive. Can't say the same for some other attempt.
I sort of agree, but I think the fact that it looks so dumb just adds to the charm. I think making it look cool would actually make it less cool. Being goofy cheese man just works.
    I love the goofy string cheese. I play it in the tcg and every week I get someone asking me if I brought the string cheese back (probably at least partially because it isn‚Äôt very good lol)
I think it's too early to call for Gholdengo. It might become the new Landorus rather than the new Lucario
[deleted]
Gholdengo is so baffling, it felt like more a cartoon character than a pok√©mon. I am surprised they didn't get anyone to say it is a cheese string thing... and I have actually not even been exposed that much to food ads.

It is still relatively popular because it is super useful in raids but it is more in spite of its looks. I absolutely won't spend a dollar on it... or maybe for a joke gift.
    I haven‚Äôt played Pok√©mon since gen IV and needed to look up who Gholfengo was. It absolutely does not look like a pok√©mon. I know the art direction has shifted since then, but it baffles me how many of the modern ones aren‚Äôt instantly recognizable as pok√©mon.
Damn though, Frigo knows how to rock the comp scene.
shiny should've been platinum.
    platinum, rose gold, white gold, all of them would have been so much better. idk what they were doing with his shiny when they had so many clear and obvious choices that could have been great
    if next game has cheese string it should have different coins to use to evolve it so like u pick up silver coins u get a silver one i love gholdengo i wish it had a cooler shiny
It's a beast, surfs instead of walking and it's made of pure gold, it's not mega popular just because it's not a dragon or a dog that walks on two legs.
Do..do people not like Gholdengo? I think it's cool and it's design is fine
    Gameplay wise I like Gholdengo. I just don't like looking at them
Calyrex and Kubfu weren‚Äôt even in the anime or the films‚Ä¶
I love Marshadow myself
Marshadow is the best :(
i feel like most of the box legendaries are pretty memorable... with the exception of zacian and zamazenta. they're the *only* two box legends that i regularly forget exist, and that's coming from someone who likes both of them

why they made it so you can only actually catch them in the goddamn *post game* i will never understand
The ease at which you can catch them just invalidates their awesomeness. The Time/Space trio were the last box legendaries that were both extremely hard to catch and weren‚Äôt necessary to catch in order to progress through the story.
Honestly, I feel like they‚Äôve been getting better and better at incorporating box legendaries into the game. I mean, the worst they did was gold and silver - just before the Elite 4, apropos of nothing, going ‚Äúhey, go catch this thing.‚Äù I remember hearing someone say that they usually don‚Äôt use the box legendary in their party because it makes it too easy, but that they went back on their rule for Solgaleo or Lunala because it felt more ‚Äúearned‚Äù I guess.
    Gen 2 handled the box legendaries in an interesting way, imo. They were optional secrets. More an evolution of the Gen 1 legendary birds than what we would come to recognize as box legendaries. They were each hidden within a formidable dungeon that you had to seek out yourself. You also got both box legendaries regardless of game, since the other mascot appeared in the post game (albeit without its signature move). The game didn't hand the legendary to you, but instead hinted at its lore and pointed you to go find it yourself. 

Gen 3 was really the start of the story-based box legendary formula. And pretty much every generation since has used Gen 3 as a rough template. Even HGSS reworked Ho-Oh and Lugia to fit the formula set by Groudon and Kyogre.
    To be fair, legendaries weren't given any real plot significance until Gen 3, maybe excepting Suicune's minor storyline in Gen 2. That's actually how I prefer legendaries.
    Look i dont mind the box legendaries,  but i feel like legendaries overall feel very... meh? Like good stats, but what i like about pokemon is the catching aspect, so in games with more legendaries or just funner pokemon (not necessarily better) im gonna forget about a lot of them
They should have been available on more than one route in that game. It would make so much sense to get to catch one on the same route as the ranch!
    That and way more opportunities to ride them than some dude's backyard
Probably doesn't help that its only halfway-decent stats are SpD and attack, but it has a mediocre support move pool and its best physical attacks are sucker punch, foul play, iron tail and strength.
Everyone is saying Zoroark, but I feel it's still super popular, no? Not on Lucario's level of course, but still easily one of the most popular of gen 5. Maybe this came later, and when gen 5 was current it wasn't popular.
    i for sure remember it being one of the more popular designs when bw came out but people had a hard on for hating gen 5 when it came out also a very popular mon in the furry community but i feel like it‚Äôs hard to not be popular  in that community lol
    Exactly, Haxorus and specially Zoroark were extremely pokemon.

Zoroark was definitely treated as the new Lucario back then (it even got its own movie). And everyone wanted to have one on their team.

It's just that it's been four generations since then.
I think they thought the whole ‚Äòband‚Äô concept they had with Toxtricity and Rillaboom was going to be more successful. I think they would both be better off without the drums/guitars.
Really? I still think Toxtricity is one of the best designs to come out of Gen 8 and definitely the star of my team in my Sword playthrough. I wish we got to keep around that beastly lizardesque gigantamax form.
Toxitricity is definitely one the most popular gen 9 pokemon
I feel like the mystery dungeon games brought him above the others with grovyle
    oh shit yeah good point i totally forgot about that 
grovyle has definitely gotta be the most liked middle stage starter
[deleted]
If Treeko had been fire or water type it might‚Äôve been a different story.  Grass starters almost always get the short end of the stick from the fanbase.  Doesn‚Äôt help that Torchic and Mudkip are cuter first stage Pok√©mon.  The Treeko line are my favorite, but they can be a hard sell without the prior knowledge of Sceptile.
How far I had to scroll to find this answer speaks for itself.
Probably because it doesnt have ears and instead has a strange conehead, looking at catgirls and cat ear headphones and stuff like that i think ears are one of the cuteness factors of cat/dog style designs
I‚Äôm pretty sure Manectric is supposed to be a lion. It has ‚Äúmane‚Äù in its English name and its Japanese name is ‚ÄúLivolt‚Äù (possibly lion+volt).
    looks like a [maned wolf](https://nationalzoo.si.edu/sites/default/files/styles/wide/public/animals/manedwolf-005.jpg?itok=H_cbgGNC) to me
I agree, I remember seeing them and being like ‚Äúis that the box legendary pre-evolution?‚Äù Now, I just look at it as ‚Äúwell, that‚Äôs a lame Pokemon‚Äù
‚ÄúRookie‚Ä¶‚Äù

-Gen 3‚Äôs 6 tiles
they gave it a mega. its appeared in multiple movies and anime episodes across multiple generations. its a playable mon in pokemon unite (and lowkey busted). thats more attention than a lot of the starters lol.
This is one of the most popular ones üòê
absol is a travesty, i love that thing but it constantly gets ignored and forgotten about
Gardevoir and Lopunny, the queens of the Pok√©mon NSFW underworld.
    The day I found out people made NSFW art/comics of those 2 is the day my brain broke. I thought Gardevoir was a graceful pokemon with good stats but now I can never have that pokemon on my team again..because of the implication
    I'd say they're pretty popular, even if part of why they're popular is sketchy. I may be biased though, since Gardevoir is my fave. Its dex entries actually sealed the deal for me, and all the rampant NSFW takes can't tank my joy of it.
    Id throw braixen in there too
Assuming the droplet emoji is supposed to represent Vaporeon, sure he's going through a renaissance, but he's still only 3rd place on e621 right now, behind Umbreon and Sylveon.
Gardevoir was your Rival's signature Pokemon in it's debut generation. Definitely feels like it was designed to be popular.
Came here to say this one, Munchlax was pushed REALLY heavily as an attempt at comic relief across different forms of media and it just never worked.
Ironic that Mimimyu, which *in-universe* is just trying to make everyone like it by pretending to be a Pikachu, seems to have been the most successful in this endeavor.

Also unpopular opinion but I kinda like Togedemaru more than Pikachu. I like cute spherical things.
But it can learn false swipe and hypnosis so is excellent for catching pokemon.
Marill was incredibly popular for a while though.  Pika-blu lives on in the hearts of many!
I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one who has to make a point that Marill is a Pikaclone despite the typing‚Ä¶
I never understood that. It's not a Lance situation where there just aren't anymore dragons so you have to use dragon-looking Pokemon. There's literally 2 more fully evolved fighting types to use.
    i think their idea was for each one to use one non-specialization typed pokemon, but even then there are better choices
        like coulve used golem, instead of atleast 1 of the onix.

Since rhydon was for giovanni adn your rival
            not to mention it‚Äôs even worse cuz he uses two of them‚Äîreplace one with poliwrath or primeape, and it‚Äôd still be much better than its actual form

hell, even if we want to go beyond rock types or the golem option, electabuzz strikes me as on-theme based on its significant arms. Pinsir, Kangaskhan, Exsecutor

if we‚Äôre keeping it open to pokemon other trainers use, both nidos and rhydon would also be good
                >Pinsir, Kangaskhan, Exsecutor

Pinsir and Kangaskhan are cool suggestions, but I can't wrap my head around how you came up with giving Bruno an Exeggutor.
                The Elite 4 should have been considered dual type specialists from the start. Lorelei would have officially been ice/water, Bruno as fighting/rock, Agatha as ghost/poison, and Lance as dragon/flying. It would have helped them stand out from the gym leaders who stick to one type, and since Lance would no longer be coy with half of his team being flying types, we couldn‚Äôt rag on him for being a ‚Äúdragon‚Äù trainer.
        Young me assumed that the Onixes were to counter your beefed-out Pidgeot that you'd had since early game.
    Because the E4 is fodder for you to train for the Champion. Also, the mons you face are reminiscent of bosses in order to evoke past fights. That's why Lorelei is so similar to Misty (redhead trainer with water mons), Bruno to Brock (shirtless fighter with messy hair and Onix) and Agatha to Team Rocket ("evil" lady with Golbat, Arbok and Haunter line).
    [deleted]
        I mean you'd have a point if the "wildcard" pokemon were actually strong pokemon. But practically every run I've seen (and I've been watching a LOT of Red and Blue runs lately, shoutout to JROSE11) the Onixes are always one-shots. Hell, plenty of times he sets up stat-boosts against them because they're so weak they don't pose a threat. 

MAYBE you could say Poliwrath would be beaten by whatever Grass or Electric type you used to sweep Lorelei, but Grass will still sweep Onix. If you want Electric coverage, than sub one for a Golem. Maybe a Marowak.
Funny enough that ends up being Chuck's team in Gen2
    Then Chuck could have used Heracross and/or Hitmontop.
But he obviously uses the Onixes to counter Flying-types!
    He might wanna invest in literally any other rock or electric type Pok√©mon
        Victory road is all the way over there though
Bit of a crime that Bruno doesn't have Poliwrath or Primeape. 

I've always been curious behind the choices for gym leaders and the E4 in Gen 1 & 2. Some of them just don't make any sense.
Polywrath is my favorite Pok√©mon still!
Wait. Bruno was a fighting type specialist? I thought he was rock. Basically, an older shirtless relative of Brock.
[deleted]
What's even weirder is that Poliwrath is one of I think 3 pokemon that do not appear at all in red/blue so you literally never see the sprite during a playthrough unless you yourself catch one (or battle a friend that has one). That type of exclusion is really weird to me.
I remember reading the manga first time during my childhood. Red‚Äôs first mons were poliwhirl, bulbasaur and pikachu.
The manga is the best pokemon media that exists CMV. They do the world such justice. The battles were fun and creative, the characters were fun and interesting, and the gyms were cooler.

Also the creator said its the closest depiction of pokemon to the world he imagined than any game movie or show
    Just recently discovered the manga myself, been a fan of pokemon since ‚Äò98. Hard agree on the quality, the pokemon moves are so much squishier in terms of versatility.
    What‚Äôs cmv?
        "Change my view"
    I love the Pok√©mon manga but the hardest part of it is that the manga in recent years have suffered due to the breakneck pack of the games‚Äô release. The manga has to keep up with the constant releases now and that has led to the last few arcs being incredibly rushed and less character and Pok√©mon development
That‚Äôs interesting, I forgot this. I guess it‚Äôs because Poliwhirl is apparently Satoshi Taijiri‚Äôs favorite Pok√©mon (hence its heavy appearances in Gen 1 stuff.)
he did get a neat evo in gen 2, but trade evos in general are a pain if you're playing by yourself
    Yeah having a trade evo as your favorite sucks
    Which always sucked cause Gengar has always been my favorite from the start.
I remember having a poliwhirl plushie like 25 years ago lol. Thing was nice af
Oh, cool! That makes so much sense!
what‚Äôs crazy is that the second mascot of pokemon is still from gen 1 but it‚Äôs eevee instead of clefairy lol
    Plus Jigglypuff totally overshadowed it in popularity thanks to its role in the anime.  Clefairy really lost out.

On the other hand Clefable is an actually good Pok√©mon game wise and Wigglytuff is pretty terrible so I suppose it's balanced itself in some ways.
        Jigglypuff also got the Smash Bros popularity bump too.
            that‚Äôs bcs of the anime popularity buff tho tbf
                It definitely could have influenced it a little bit, but from my understanding Sakurai really loved Kirby and wanted a second fighter with a similar model.
                    >Sakurai really loved Kirby

of course, Kirby is Sakurai's creation
        Clefairy actually is more viable than Clefable in the officially competitive format which is neat!
    Let's Go Clefairy would had been awesome ngl.
        But instead of getting it from Professor Oak you had to go to Mount Moon to get your starter. Which kind of resembles a lot of characters from the anime, like Iris and Axew.
    For me, Eevee isn't my favorite pokemon, but when you include its evolutionary line it feels like the most pokemon of any pokemon.
As a kid, I saw Yellow and Pink as equally "feminine" colours because of the original Power Rangers. I still remember how odd I though it was when I saw the first male "Yellow Ranger"
    Yellow Ranger was masculine in the series that Saban spliced to make Mighty Morphin‚Äô. You‚Äôll notice only Pink‚Äôs suit has the little skirt.
All colors are gender neutral if you‚Äôre not a little b@&$h about it.
The Simpsons?
There are a few other pokemon still trapped in home jail.

Patrat and Watchog

Alolan Form Rattata and Raticate (In the Let's Go games but a Alolan Rattata transferred from Bank isn't transferable to Let's Go)

Spinda (In BDSP but for some reason BDSP Spinda can't be transfered to home. Likewise Spinda transferred from bank can't be transferred to BDSP)
    Apparently the reason why spinda isn‚Äôt transferable is because the coding used for its spots were all done backwards. So it‚Äôs just straight up incompatible with home. Hope you didn‚Äôt get a shiny one
        It's not that Spinda is incompatible with HOME, but that Spinda from outside games are incompatible with BDSP and Spinda from BDSP... well, they can't go anywhere anyway. So you can bring a Spinda up into HOME, but then it's stuck there until Game Freak puts it in another game.

I honestly find it to be a profoundly offensive oversight that this bug has not been fixed. I personally don't care about Spinda at all, but every Pok√©mon is somebody's favorite and I feel terrible for anyone who might have transferred a Spinda to HOME from Gen VII who now cannot play with their beloved Pok√©mon. To me, that goes against the entire spirit of Pok√©mon.

I have a similar rant about Dexit, but it's basically the same point except longer so I won't bore anyone by going into that.
        It was transferrable at some point, because I got a pile in my home boxes. Trapped , I assume.
Tauros got forms because bulls are a big thing in Spain.
    I understand fully and dont think it is wrong. 

I just want Ele-goats and am petty-mad because Gogoat is my top 5 favs
I have to wonder, parts of Zoroark make me think they intended for it to be a playground rumor. This Pokemon you can't get, but has a surprise reveal during N's final battle, and the mysterious Lostlorn Forest with no apparent purpose? The Zorua you read about in Castelia, but can't find anywhere? That screams playground rumor material.

But then on the other hand, they gave it a whole damn movie, tons of exposure, and a huge amount of attention in the shiny beasts event *long* before BW released.

They tried to recreate Lucario *and* Mew at the same time, when both were successful for different, opposing reasons.
    Locario and the Mystery of Mew you say?
        No, Lucario and mew. The Pokemons. The first one was HEAVILY featured both in the games and in the promotional material pre release of the games. You can see Lucario in a gym leader's team in DPP, In the champion's team in DPP and in the team of a beloved npc during his quest line. It was featured heavily in the anime, in the movies, and it's easily available as an egg halfway through the game. Lucario is effectively a mascot of gen 4, it's easily available but also very special and unique.

On the other hand mew was only featured in one movie during gen 1's lifespan. It's almost never mentioned in the game, featured only in descriptions, and normally it's not obtainable without a proper event or distribution, which incidentally happened only in Japan during the release of its own movie. It's eeriness, the not knowing whether it really existed or not, spawned a ton of playground theories. The mystique around it was part of its popularity.

It seems that they wanted to make a pokemon that was mysterious and elusive to obtain enough to create legends and theories about itself at the playgrounds, but that at the same time was at the forefront of that franchise, being basically everywhere in anime, movies and all promotional material. If you know that something REALLY EXISTS and what it can do, then it has no mystery left to reveal. 

Arceus is so beloved by the franchise because it was treated Like mew, something so legendary and elusive that it has an aura of mystery. It's barely mentioned in the games, impossible to obtain without an event that was never distributed, and only officially revealed with its own movie.
            Arceus is an example of Game Freak REALLY getting a Pok√©mon right. The Sinjoh Ruins event in HGSS is one of the weirdest and most memorable events in any Pok√©mon game. PLA also did a fantastic job making Arceus feel like... well, Arceus. If only every mythical could be so realized.
Riolu on the other hand was made available halfway through the game as a gift egg at iron island, with a very fun quest line associated with it. It makes you want to get it after seeing it being featured heavily in the teams of some of the coolest trainers in the game
Sneasel syndrome.

\- Appears ultra late in Gen2 and 4, but also can't evolve in Gen 4 despite having unevolved stat line.
Yep. I remember, I saw the movie on Cartoon Network and thought "gee, that's a cool Pok√©mon. Can't wait to get one in the new game." Then, while playing the game, I found out that you can't actually get one in the game. Then years later, I found out that it was connected to an event that I had no idea even happened when it did.
It's a great tool for keeping people's attention, not so great for the actual players themselves.
Pseudos with rarity of legendaries are weird. Paradox Pokemon would be legendary post Gen 9 as we would have no way of obtaining them after SV era ends. Ultra Beasts are in the same spots, but is treated as a legendary rightfully.
I mean, Zeraora just kind of...exists. The most it got was a role in a movie, but even that got overshadowed by everything else in it.
Everytime I see it or it's name this is what I think followed by the song playing on loop in my head
"Zarude is buffeted by the Zandstorm!"
Yeah getting mythicals from random code distributions makes them very uneventful.
    Also them not having an event in-game is pretty boring.

Think back to Gen 3, 4 and 5 (for victini at least) where you generally got an item and had to go somewhere in the world to obtain the pokemon.

That made the encounter much more special than "Insert code, receive mon, maybe get a conversation, like with Diancie"
        Even most if not all of the other Unova mythicals had *something* for them.  Keldeo had the little clearing to get Resolute Form.  Meloetta had the guy in Castelia who would play the relic song.  Even Genesect at least had the scientist who would give the different drives.
            Meloetta also had an [event](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok√©mon_Global_Link_promotions#Musical_shows) related for Pok√©mon Musical feature although its separate from getting the mythical. 

This obscure event is the only time that a Mythical is implied to be owned by a trainer in the main series game outside of the protagonist.
        Spoilers for Indigo Disk DLC:

>!I LOVE THE MELOETTA ENCOUNTER FOR THIS EXACT REASON! It's such an insanely complex and nonsensical way to encounter a Pok√©mon, but the result is a genuinely exciting encounter that had me cackling like a child even though I looked up a guide to get it. My ONE complaint about this encounter is that I really don't think you can figure it out on your own. SV does not really encourage you to talk to random NPCs, so you'll probably never get the hints. And even if you do, they don't spell things out super clearly, so I think it's unlikely anyone will organically encounter Meloetta without the internet telling them she's out there. But man, what an amazing moment that would be. I wish all Mythicals were obtained like this.!<
    Heck if you‚Äôre going to gift them at least distribute them at lvl 10 or 20 so we can actually use them for a playthrough. Lvl 100 just ensures they‚Äôre never getting used
        The level 5 event Pokemon they briefly did were fucking rad. ORAS had a shiny Beldum with hold back (which is false swipe with a different name) so he was strong and good for catching. S&M followed that up with a munchlax with hold back, happy hour, metronome, and a Snorlax z-crystal. Z-Metronoming my way through the game was a blast.

More alt starters and less unique Pokemon with no substance pls, gamefreak.
    This is why I like the Meloetta event in the indigo disc

You spin around like the peroette form , then use the sepia filter as a reference to the og black and white event where the guy talks about his sepia colored dreams , feels very gen 3 esque imo
    The game won't even let you nickname them to make them feel personalized.
Pecharunt is already more memorable for me just due to the sheer amount of theorizing people have done for it from the teal mask
People have complained that a lot of recent mythicals‚Äô issues have been because there‚Äôs not much you have to do *in game* to get them - like, you don‚Äôt get to travel to a new area or anything, there‚Äôs just someone standing in the pokemon center to give them to you.

With that in mind, I wish that they would just change the modern idea of mythicals altogether, so that the DLC legendaries would be considered mythicals. It‚Äôs still technically content that isn‚Äôt accessible in the base game, that you have to download, so it *kinda* counts. It‚Äôs better than just adding some Pok√©mon you get with a code that no one will remember.
Honestly this is why I feel like gen 5 were the last very memorable legendaries/mythics. It's because you can remember the events and cutscenes. I was so pissed when Diancie didnt get a special quest involving the sundial or the crystal cave.
Most Mythics are like that in general, tbh. Download event ticket, go to a one-off map that's never going to get used again, fight and catch it like any other 'mon, and let it rot in the box. Maybe sprinkle in a line or two of dialogue if an NPC is involved.
Mythics in the first five generations(except gen iii, jirachi and deoxys were very random, but the deoxys situation was somewhat fixed in the remakes) were linked to the lore in the region. After that, they just became dull.
There's also the fact that the movie plays against it's rarity and mythic status, by featuring a whole tribe of Zarudes
    I think it's somewhat plausible.

It is not rare in the sense that there are just very few specimen of it, but because they live so deep in the jungle that most humans will probably never encounter them in their entire life.
And man, until you said this, I was getting Zarude mixed up with the electric anthro-cat mythical.
Now I can‚Äôt unsee Zarude as just an alternate timeline final evo of Grookey lol it def has that vibe
it doesnt help that there is literally already a grass monkey in the very same game/generation, *and* its a starter w a similar colour scheme. its just kind of a weird choice.
You named 3 non-mythicals. Heatran isn't mythical and I suspect you meant volcanion. Crescelia isn't mythical, maybe you were thinking of Genesect(?).

Mewtwo isn't mythical either.

The most important large mythical is Arceus.
Lore wise, Zarude doesn‚Äôt seem mythical at all either. It‚Äôs been confirmed that multiple Zarude exist, so it‚Äôs not some one of a kind Pok√©mon like Mew, Celebi, Jirachi, etc. 

And it has the power of healing plants and forests, but that‚Äôs nothing new in the Pok√©mon world - even Meganium can heal plants back to life.
Now that you mention it, I do remember when I was playing, I really did want one but was massively disappointed when there was no way to catch a Zorua. Now I don't think of Zoroark at all.
    Exactly - it wasn‚Äôt able to be obtained despite my looking for it and wanting to catch it. It wasn‚Äôt findable so it couldn‚Äôt be ‚Äúpart of the team‚Äù and get good memories
        They fixed that by having it on Route 1 in Ultra Sun/Moon with a 30% encounter rate in this one patch of grass. That was my second main line Pok√©mon game, and I had a Zorua on my team and fell in love with it.
Needing to transfer either an event Celebi from HGSS for Zorua, or an event shiny Johto Beast from DPPt for Zoroark, is an infuriatingly idiotic requirement for getting Pok√©mon featured in a *movie*
make it a free gift egg in BW1 and easy profit
    Worked for Volcarona, that seems fairly popular (obviously not to the levels of Lucario, Charizard and Greninja).
        But Volcarona only worked once. Now you have to get a Larvesta and level it up like insane to get a Volcarona.
            I like to call that Gen 5 syndrome. (Seriously, level 59 for volcarona and 64 for hydreigon??)
            Volcarona can be obtained at level 35 in the mid game in BW2 but that‚Äôs an exception.
    They already did it first with Riolu in gen 4, why they didn't try it again in gen 5?
        Heck, they give you a free Mega Lucario in gen 6
            It's funny how both XY and ORAS just gives you a free mega relatively early on

Yes I'm sure giving me a mega evolution when 90% of the game involves fights with mega-less trainers is a good idea lmao
    They did this actually...in japan...I had a Japanese copy of white and was able to grab and raise it in game and then breed it and send an egg to an English copy of black once that came out!
        Thing is, a lot of people dont live in japan, thus not having access to japenese events, especially the kids that lived outside of japan. 
This is my biggest gripe with gamefreak, they run a bunch of really cool events within japan, shiny this, mythical that, and then just ignore the rest of the world when theres a decent playerbase everwhere else
bw1 is especially bad for this like u can‚Äôt catch fuckall until like 3 gyms in then u still gotta wait until like the e4 or post game to get a heap of mons cos they‚Äôre either rlly late game or they level up so late there‚Äôs no point
    [deleted]
        yeah rufflet or vullaby evolving around 50 is pretty bad in bw when get them after like 7th gym in mid to high 30's, but its far worse when find them early game in later games
        The real problem is that they actually had a good level curve and wanted you to have some time with the base versions before they evolve, at least for the birds and Deino, Larveresta has no excuse, they probably should have just been available to find earlier into the region, like do something like open up Marvelous Bridge but keep the version city closed around Driftveil and make them available there
Same thing for Milotic. It's still quite popular, because it's a beautiful pokemon indeed, but the fact that very few players got it, specially before beating the Elite4, must have hindered its popularity a lot
    I think this is part of why I love Milotic so much. I was that kid who spent eight hours straight hunting for a Feebas and then had a Milotic on my team during the story play. It made me a legend amongst my friends and Pok√©mon-playing peers, especially since I bred her and had multiple Milotic (and traded some Feebas for legendaries). I still have that first Milotic and she's still in Sapphire. :)
    ORAS did it right giving Feebas a fixed tile to find it
Not to mention battle preview ruin any chance of him being viable outside of playthrough.
    Would disagree a bit with this point. Especially since the introduction of H-Zoroark into VGC. Although, I do wish there was no preview that would also mean an enormous uptick in Zoroark usage 

And it actually messes with ppls head (or not at all) when they see H-Zoroark in preview. I‚Äôll elaborate - players either do 1 or 2 things when they see Zoroark in my party 

1) Completely ignore or forget Zoroark was in my party which allows Zoroark additional turn(s) to either support or setup 

2) Over prepare or over analyze. (This involves switching a mon out or using a dark move when it would normally be ‚Äúnot very effective‚Äù)

Scenario #1 is far more common. Ppl very often just ignore or forget about Zoroark and still use fake out, close combat, drain punch, shadow ball (any normal, fighting, ghost type moves). Which ofc, H-Zoroark is immune to. 

H-Zoroark biggest strength in my party is still the element of surprise mostly bc ppl just don‚Äôt see him as a threat or get too caught up in several other strategies that are possible with my team and far more common in the VGC (and I do sometimes still use those strategies)

I‚Äôve never took a shot at regional or anything but every season I would make into a decent standing in Master Rank and always have an over .500 record. Certainly not in the top 100 every season but I‚Äôve gotten close and would say I‚Äôm at least capable
        Zoroark isn‚Äôt really a thing in vgc except for meme teams tbh. Even with illusion, it‚Äôs just not that good. You can def have fun with it on ladder and probably take it to some locals, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ever had any decent placements at higher level events. 

The meta is so hyper offensive that even resisted and neutral hits are removing it from the field.
I think of Hisuian Zoroark before I do normal Zoroark to be honest. Zorua and Zoroark were cool for like 5 minutes back when Black/White launched, then we found out it couldn't be obtained outside a one off event and everybody just lost all interest.

Things like that are large part of why I hate that time limited events with exclusive pokemon are still a thing, anyone that misses the event is just screwed forever unless the event repeats at some point, and even then they can still be screwed if said event is in the next gen.
    Me when I missed Iron Leaves and Walking Wake with no promise of getting them again:
        Bruh theyre in tera raids rn.
Yeah. In the 2020 poll it came 23rd. While obviously not as good as Lucario being in 2nd, I would find it  hard to call any Pokemon in the top 50 not very popular Pokemon
It's popularity has definitely risen in the past decade since it's debut, but it'll never reach the levels of Lucario, whose my second favorite Pokemon.
I honestly remember Misty more for Psyduck (the comic relief that she would keep bringing out by accident but who was secretly very powerful), Togepi (the baby of the bunch), Staryu (her actual only competent Pok√©mon), and Goldeen (who was never useful except in the water) than I do her Horsea (as I cannot recall what Horsea's running gag was).
    Horsea was the small weak one that was actually smart. it got kidnapped once and used its Spitting ink to create a trail for the characters to follow if I remember correctly
        Pokemon was always a kids show, but reading this it's nice to remember how every Pokemon was unique, they all had their quarks, personality and attitude.
        Yep in the Eevolutions episode
    Staryu was the best. HYAH!
    You completely missed her Starmie which she typically reserved for utility rather than battle.  She had a powerful 'mon in her pocket most of the time though.
        I forgot she had both a Starmie AND a Staryu on her team.
    Starmie in the corner here thinking "fine guess I'll just leave then".

No but for real, it always seemed like her Staryu was stronger from what I remember, which is pretty weird
Psyduck isn‚Äôt necessarily her mascot‚Ä¶ but it has gags, which kind of make it memorable. Like, it kind of reminds me of James‚Äô Victreebell, even when Weezing is his real mascot.
    I'd probably say Psyduck could be considered her mascot, at least up until Togepi arrives, due to it being so memorable for her. I suppose you could also argue it was her most powerful pokemon, it's just neither of them knew how to use that power at will. 

I always kind of saw Psyduck as a bit of a metaphor for Misty. Has a headache most of the time (both Psyduck and Ash gave Misty "headaches"), can have temper/rage outbursts, lives in the shadow of her more talented sisters (Psyduck and Misty's other pokemon), has untapped potential and strength and comes up clutch when needed and/or is least expected. I may have read too much into it all, but Psyduck seemed the perfect fit to me as her mascot or "pal" pokemon, with her ace, then, probably being Starmie.
    Downfall is that Psyduvk's gag became stale fast and overshadowed her other Pokemon.

Oh she's gonna send out Starmie? Wrong, Psyduck.

Oh no Psyduck is massively outmatched? Jokes on you every time the opponent will play into the gag of hitting it until the headache power activates.
To be fair i remember all of her pokemon vividly
Honestly he's kind of crazy in RBY. Abra doesn't require much investment to get to Kadabra and start destroying everything, but you can do even less work and trade for Mr. Mime to IMMEDIATELY destroy everything. The boosted EXP also helps him level faster and stay strong. Honestly a top-tier in-game Pok√©mon.
For those who weren‚Äôt Pokefans before Gen 2‚Äôs release, there was so much Mythos out there about Marill, or ‚ÄúPikablu‚Äù as some called it.
    I remember those days. "Leaks" of PIKABLU and Ho-Oh. 

Looking for Mew under the truck for the umpteenth time. 

Watching ripped Japanese scenes of the Pokemon Mewtwo Movie.
        I remember the insane arguments about the weird looking Moltres in the anime lmao.
            In my circles it was well accepted that the Pokemon missing from the dex in the first episode of the anime was in fact Missing it's Number, thus Ho Oh is forever Missingno to me
        The Mew Truck thing sounded plausible if not likely.

The actual way to force a Mew spawn with the RNG and things like Nugget Bridge sounded like absolute bullshit but actually worked by gaming the coding lol
            I was convinced the keys in the game corner was connected to the truck to get mew as a kid. 


Now I know that the keys on a machine just means you went to crap and no one take my spot
        Ho-oh was in the first episode of the anime, too. They had years of plans already and probably just enjoyed watching Gen I squirm
    It would've been so cool if they kept doing differently typed Pikaclones instead of clogging up the electric type with the same mon every gen
        Especially since a bunch are single evos. I‚Äôd be okay if we had another couple fully evolved lines of electric rodent.
            Like the Pawmi line, which is my favorite pika-clone in part because you can actually use them.
                I'm meh on the design but it's a neat typing and a neat concept.

However, it's also the only one where I agree that the evolution stages look way too similar, but that could be made worse by its debut in Paldea where it's a lot easier to mix up smaller 'mons.
    the pikablu days were good days, so much excitement and hype!
    The pok√©gods...
    Even the trading cards for the first movie called it Pikablu. Also Snubull was Buru.
        That's probably worth a pretty penny now
It will forever make me sad that instead of getting a creatively designed rodent of a different element each generation, we get repeated electric rodents that all look borderline identical.

It‚Äôs like when a movie is successful, and they focus on all the wrong parts for the sequel
    It‚Äôs probably *because* of Marill‚Äôs unpopularity that they returned to Electric.
I wish they would have stuck with the elemental mouse concept for pikachu clones. The first few pikaclones are just electric mice with weird mechanics, and even when they started adding extra types you could still mostly count on electric as one of the types. 

I wish they had it where each gen gets it's own elemental mouse, kinda like eeveelutions. Would make the concept more interesting avd give the different pikaclones different niches
I still don't know what the hunger switch does for Morpeko
    Changes the type of its signature move. When its full belly its electric type and when its hungry its dark type
        Ohhh thank you! I wanted to use Morpeko in my team in sword at one point but the constant switch made the battles take too long. So I just switched it out. Never noticed type change on its move.
Mimikyu isn‚Äôt an exception because it‚Äôs not considered as an electric type Pikachu clone. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs interesting lol. Togedamaru is the one for Gen 7 instead.
Alola also has Togedemaru
Mimkyu is not a pikaclone.
Yeah it's not how I meant it. More like, they should have been even more popular, be the mascot of each gen just like Pikachu have been. 
It's just how I feel about them anyway
Also because they're quite superfluous when every single game has Eevee in it.
    Eevee wasn‚Äôt available in Black and White, the monkeys‚Äô debut games.
        Which only aupports the notion that they monkeys were there to fill that gap, but since Eevee is in every game since BW, the monkeys are surplus to requirements.
It was Pikachu‚Äôs fault. Ban Pikachu.
Now they need to design a 2D Pok√©mon to be in a 3D game to come full circle
I know right?!

I think Porygon would be great inside a Pok√©dex like Rotom

Or rotom and Porygon could make a great duo!

The Porygon line is so underutilized
He should have been a bigger Yamper imo
    Exactly, I love yamper (I have a corgi IRL) but Bolthund is the most generic uninteresting dog Pok√©mon ever conceived
        I love Boltund personally (It's a dog so of course I will), but it's design is definitely just too generic dog to be more popular. Probably would've been smarter to just continue the corgi theme, especially since the breed is super popular nowadays (I had two when I was a kid).
            Bolthund always felt like it was trying to invoke a greyhound, which makes me wonder if historically dog racing was a thing in the inspiring region from real world or the in game region.

Edit: or just general foxhounds which when I looked them up were so painfully generic they look like what I would put as the ‚Äúdog‚Äù picture in a dictionary‚Ä¶ /smh
        I went into Sword and Shield without knowing too much about the game so I was so excited to catch Yamper. And then I evolved it and I boxed it. I was heartbroken üòü I was expecting it to stay a corgi and I was so let down!
    yeah it should‚Äôve stayed a corgi or like evolved into a sheepdog looking dog instead also bolthund looks like weirdly bald idk not a fan of him as much as i love yamper
        Let's not forget the complete stat change on evolution either.  Yamper starts off with like, 29 base speed and then hits 121 on evolution.  You get this funny chonky corgi who seems like he'll be a bulky electric wall who ends up evolving into a completely separate dog breed that's a speed demon.

The juxtaposition between the two ideas is just jarring, especially on an animal that most people have a strong familiarity with.  We know dog breeds are distinct and different, and we saw a corgi then wanted a corgi.  But it evolves and essentially becomes a whole new concept unrelated to its base beyond "dog".

Yamper sucks because he's an example of one of the worst outcomes of evolution: becoming something so completely different or unexpected that the player gets disappointed since they liked the original idea.  It's not like Bug types either - we all know caterpillars become butterflies, so when Caterpie evolves we're already fully on board to see that drastic change.

No one was expecting that from not only a dog, but a dog breed that's so iconic to the region the game took inspiration from.
            yeah like there‚Äôs lots of british dogs they could‚Äôve used but bolthund is like just generic dog it doesn‚Äôt seem like any breed particularly also maybe it‚Äôs in the dex or smth idk but yamper and its evo should‚Äôve had some sorta rivalry with wololo since corgis are sheepdogs and farm shit like that is pretty big in the uk also ur right it should‚Äôve kept bulky and used a shetland sheepdog as a base like it could‚Äôve used its fur to hold electricity and shock anyone that tried to attack (lore wise good excuse to give it high defence) i feel like dog mons get done kinda dirty like cat mons are usually really well designed

                What are you talking about, Boltund's clearly a greyhound.
                I love the idea of a Sheltie Yamper evo! It feels like a much more natural progression both in visuals and inspirations.
        Its because bolthund is a super hero and the fox thing was the villian. They both look idiotic because mascot concept look trumps generally interesting design.
            ohhh that makes a little more sense i liked the fox a lot thought tbh it felt like an old school pokemon
                Nicket is adorable. The second form looks dumb
To be fair i dont really like lucario zoroark zeraora esque type of pokemon so to me so i really put them real low
Definitely.

Zeraora being mythical has no rhyme nor reason.
Its not even a pokemon you get to use in a playthrough since its mythical status.

Like, imagine Zeraora as an in game mon with a prevo(maybe even evo?) I dont think itll be as bad.

Heck its a feline right? Not sure why didnt they just do a tiny electric cat pokemon as a prevo and make it a mon...
    It was just randomly added to Ultra Sun and Moon. The only memorable thing about it was that shiny event in Generation 8.

Despite that, Zarude is probably the Mythical that is the least memorable outside of Phione.
        At least Zarude has that dumb alternate form, but the competition between those two as most unnecessary mythical is still a close competition.
        The randomness of when it came out. It felt like everyone was already moving on from US/UM, and then they just throw this mythical out there like "hey, we forgot we had this thing, so, ugh, here you go."

It's like the exact opposite of Zygarde, where they built up this big thing that everyone thought would lead to a game version Pokemon Z, but they said "haha, Sike. Wait until next Gen so we can shoehorn Zygarde lore in there since we are ~~too lazy to make~~ going to surprise everyone by not making a Z version."
            I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the 20th anniversary is why the developers didn‚Äôt make Pokemon Z.
        Phione/Manaphy and Zeraora also should have been dual typed. Electric fists? If it was our first electric fighting it would have at least that going for it.
Also Azumarill gets fairy typing but Manaphy doesn't??
            GF seems dislike adding new type to legenday/mythical Pokemon.
                Volcanion is the only water/fire Pokemon though
                    I think they were referring to the fact that they would‚Äôve had to have added fairy type to manaphy retroactively. There‚Äôs several Gen 1-5 mythicals that gamefreak could have believably added fairy type to, and they didn‚Äôt add it to any of them - so it seems like they made a conscious decision that they *weren‚Äôt* going to do that.
    Mythicals are way overdone. I think there should be a max of 2 per region (and it's really best to go with just 1). Zeraora also doesn't look mythical to me. It looks great (I actually like its design more than Lucario's), but the second I learned it was mythical... meh, lost interest.
        I liked mythicals when they have like... you know, reasoning for being one.



Zeraora and Volcanion dont have reasons on what they are. They just exist. 

Its not like Magearna or Diancie whos a manmade creation or a mutation.

Nor like Marshadow whos the rainbow feather guardian.
I like Zeraora, but it kind of feels like someone's Sonic the Hedgehog OC.
OUCH
That‚Äôs nice, I really like them. I think they look the way Satoshi Taijiri first imagined most of Pokemon looking like, kaiju-types mixed with animals. I always have a Nidoking in my team if present in the game :)!
It's pretty crazy to think that you can get a 3rd stage Mon with good stats before the second gym
    That grows fast and can learn almost everything. And looks awesome!
It worked on me too, I‚Äôm a Nidoran fan since 1998 and will keep being one :)! I was hoping they would come back with the DLC but got really dissapointed :(.
It‚Äôs tradition at this point. I doubt they even care about the Pika-clones being popular anymore, it‚Äôs just something that every region needs to feel complete, alongside the birds, rt. 1 normal types, and one or two bug lines. It would feel weird if they excluded them.
Pachirisu was used to win worlds as a super underground niche pick which got it a decent amount of fame as the face of ‚Äòunderdog‚Äô pokemon / playing with your favourite (even though the player didn‚Äôt care much for pachirisu aside from its unique capabilities until after the win)
Because otherwise it wouldn't be able to add weather ball to its moveset.

You would have to get rid of one of the weather moves to include sandstorm instead and that would still lock you out of one of its transformations.

Also, I think the real purpose with castform was to show how prominent were weathers as a mechanic when gen 3 came out. 

And it certainly worked. Everyone paid attention to the addition of weathers thanks to castform.
    >Because otherwise it wouldn't be able to add weather ball to its moveset. You would have to get rid of one of the weather moves to include sandstorm instead and that would still lock you out of one of its transformations.
 
Can you elaborate? My brain is having a hard time understanding why this wouldn't work.
        Sunny Day, Rain Dance, Hail, Weather Ball. That fills all four move slots. So if he had a Sandstorm form, you‚Äôd have to give up on one of the other three forms or your only attacking move.
            Or the trainer could just pick which weather moves to have on it at any given time‚Ä¶
    My Castform‚Äôs four moves were Sunny Day, Flamethrower, Weather Ball, and Thunderbolt, so the 4-move argument literally doesn‚Äôt hold water for me‚Ä¶
Deoxys was also able to change forms, albeit not during battle.
I know it‚Äôs bad, I was just pointing it out because it‚Äôs very unique. Even though slow start is bad it was still a legendary signature ability
Is this a r/boneappletea in the wild??
U/bobsplosion mentioned an even ‚Äúplaying field‚Äù. This is actually a zoning issue.
    r/unexpectedoffice
But Entei and Suicune featured in the third and fourth movies, adding heavily to their mystique; if the pattern had followed, the fifth film could have featured Raikou but instead it was about the upcoming Gen 3 legendaries Latios and Latias‚Äîand besides it being one of my favorite Pok√©mon movies, it does still feel like a missed opportunity.
Suicune did have the storyline in Crystal with Eusine chasing it, you get the Clear Bell as well from the radio tower director as well that triggers the event for it.
Suicune had an entire game with it on the cover while Entei had the third movie. Raikou was screwed over from before even the GBA.
Infernape is definitely not liked or disliked by any significant amount compared to torterra and empoleon. And humanoid pokemon have been a thing since Gen 1, machop and hitmon lines are popular. I don't think monkeys are worse off
Too human made me think of Mr mime immediately, seriously catching a Mr mime is enslavement Smdh
A shame the mode switch does next to nothing.  Would've been neat if it altered stats but no it just changes the typing of one move and that's it.
Yeah I mentioned that in my post, it's crazy how everytime its available it becomes obligatory in most teams
With spoons for hands.
It‚Äôs weird when you look at Gen 5 Pokemon and so many of them are basically direct copies of Gen 1 mons. Not saying they all are but seriously they created a copy of Tauros, Chansey, Hitmonlee and Hitmonchan, etc. They have a geodude copy and even a Hypno copy with Musharna.
a poor man's Chansey
And Chansey/Audino
I'm of the same mind, mostly. I don't feel like they 'failed'... Just that B/W and Gen 5 was very hit/miss for people... And, I might be bold in saying this, I don't know a person IRL that grew up with or has played Gen 5 that likes Lucario *more* than Zoroark...
Fair point, though it's still nowhere near as popular as Charizard or Greninja, even though GF probably intended it to be as popular.
It was the second gen 2 Pok√©mon seen after Togepi. When we met Tracy in the orange islands he had a Maril and it was a big deal at the time. Never took off in the same popularity though. Sad, it was a good design
    Ho-oh was in the first ep so Marill is actually third then.
I have a ton of them if you want one. They made them Pokemon Go exclusive like Meltan.

I've just been passing them out in Home through wonder trade.
I genuinely felt so disappointed when I learned that roaming Gimmighoul evolves into Gholdengo the same as the regular forms. I don't know what I would've expected, but it definitely feels like a letdown that there's literally nothing special about them at all
I love the goofy string cheese. I play it in the tcg and every week I get someone asking me if I brought the string cheese back (probably at least partially because it isn‚Äôt very good lol)
I haven‚Äôt played Pok√©mon since gen IV and needed to look up who Gholfengo was. It absolutely does not look like a pok√©mon. I know the art direction has shifted since then, but it baffles me how many of the modern ones aren‚Äôt instantly recognizable as pok√©mon.
platinum, rose gold, white gold, all of them would have been so much better. idk what they were doing with his shiny when they had so many clear and obvious choices that could have been great
if next game has cheese string it should have different coins to use to evolve it so like u pick up silver coins u get a silver one i love gholdengo i wish it had a cooler shiny
Gameplay wise I like Gholdengo. I just don't like looking at them
Gen 2 handled the box legendaries in an interesting way, imo. They were optional secrets. More an evolution of the Gen 1 legendary birds than what we would come to recognize as box legendaries. They were each hidden within a formidable dungeon that you had to seek out yourself. You also got both box legendaries regardless of game, since the other mascot appeared in the post game (albeit without its signature move). The game didn't hand the legendary to you, but instead hinted at its lore and pointed you to go find it yourself. 

Gen 3 was really the start of the story-based box legendary formula. And pretty much every generation since has used Gen 3 as a rough template. Even HGSS reworked Ho-Oh and Lugia to fit the formula set by Groudon and Kyogre.
To be fair, legendaries weren't given any real plot significance until Gen 3, maybe excepting Suicune's minor storyline in Gen 2. That's actually how I prefer legendaries.
Look i dont mind the box legendaries,  but i feel like legendaries overall feel very... meh? Like good stats, but what i like about pokemon is the catching aspect, so in games with more legendaries or just funner pokemon (not necessarily better) im gonna forget about a lot of them
That and way more opportunities to ride them than some dude's backyard
i for sure remember it being one of the more popular designs when bw came out but people had a hard on for hating gen 5 when it came out also a very popular mon in the furry community but i feel like it‚Äôs hard to not be popular  in that community lol
Exactly, Haxorus and specially Zoroark were extremely pokemon.

Zoroark was definitely treated as the new Lucario back then (it even got its own movie). And everyone wanted to have one on their team.

It's just that it's been four generations since then.
oh shit yeah good point i totally forgot about that 
grovyle has definitely gotta be the most liked middle stage starter
looks like a [maned wolf](https://nationalzoo.si.edu/sites/default/files/styles/wide/public/animals/manedwolf-005.jpg?itok=H_cbgGNC) to me
The day I found out people made NSFW art/comics of those 2 is the day my brain broke. I thought Gardevoir was a graceful pokemon with good stats but now I can never have that pokemon on my team again..because of the implication
I'd say they're pretty popular, even if part of why they're popular is sketchy. I may be biased though, since Gardevoir is my fave. Its dex entries actually sealed the deal for me, and all the rampant NSFW takes can't tank my joy of it.
Id throw braixen in there too
i think their idea was for each one to use one non-specialization typed pokemon, but even then there are better choices
    like coulve used golem, instead of atleast 1 of the onix.

Since rhydon was for giovanni adn your rival
        not to mention it‚Äôs even worse cuz he uses two of them‚Äîreplace one with poliwrath or primeape, and it‚Äôd still be much better than its actual form

hell, even if we want to go beyond rock types or the golem option, electabuzz strikes me as on-theme based on its significant arms. Pinsir, Kangaskhan, Exsecutor

if we‚Äôre keeping it open to pokemon other trainers use, both nidos and rhydon would also be good
            >Pinsir, Kangaskhan, Exsecutor

Pinsir and Kangaskhan are cool suggestions, but I can't wrap my head around how you came up with giving Bruno an Exeggutor.
            The Elite 4 should have been considered dual type specialists from the start. Lorelei would have officially been ice/water, Bruno as fighting/rock, Agatha as ghost/poison, and Lance as dragon/flying. It would have helped them stand out from the gym leaders who stick to one type, and since Lance would no longer be coy with half of his team being flying types, we couldn‚Äôt rag on him for being a ‚Äúdragon‚Äù trainer.
    Young me assumed that the Onixes were to counter your beefed-out Pidgeot that you'd had since early game.
Because the E4 is fodder for you to train for the Champion. Also, the mons you face are reminiscent of bosses in order to evoke past fights. That's why Lorelei is so similar to Misty (redhead trainer with water mons), Bruno to Brock (shirtless fighter with messy hair and Onix) and Agatha to Team Rocket ("evil" lady with Golbat, Arbok and Haunter line).
[deleted]
    I mean you'd have a point if the "wildcard" pokemon were actually strong pokemon. But practically every run I've seen (and I've been watching a LOT of Red and Blue runs lately, shoutout to JROSE11) the Onixes are always one-shots. Hell, plenty of times he sets up stat-boosts against them because they're so weak they don't pose a threat. 

MAYBE you could say Poliwrath would be beaten by whatever Grass or Electric type you used to sweep Lorelei, but Grass will still sweep Onix. If you want Electric coverage, than sub one for a Golem. Maybe a Marowak.
Then Chuck could have used Heracross and/or Hitmontop.
He might wanna invest in literally any other rock or electric type Pok√©mon
    Victory road is all the way over there though
Just recently discovered the manga myself, been a fan of pokemon since ‚Äò98. Hard agree on the quality, the pokemon moves are so much squishier in terms of versatility.
What‚Äôs cmv?
    "Change my view"
I love the Pok√©mon manga but the hardest part of it is that the manga in recent years have suffered due to the breakneck pack of the games‚Äô release. The manga has to keep up with the constant releases now and that has led to the last few arcs being incredibly rushed and less character and Pok√©mon development
Yeah having a trade evo as your favorite sucks
Which always sucked cause Gengar has always been my favorite from the start.
Plus Jigglypuff totally overshadowed it in popularity thanks to its role in the anime.  Clefairy really lost out.

On the other hand Clefable is an actually good Pok√©mon game wise and Wigglytuff is pretty terrible so I suppose it's balanced itself in some ways.
    Jigglypuff also got the Smash Bros popularity bump too.
        that‚Äôs bcs of the anime popularity buff tho tbf
            It definitely could have influenced it a little bit, but from my understanding Sakurai really loved Kirby and wanted a second fighter with a similar model.
                >Sakurai really loved Kirby

of course, Kirby is Sakurai's creation
    Clefairy actually is more viable than Clefable in the officially competitive format which is neat!
Let's Go Clefairy would had been awesome ngl.
    But instead of getting it from Professor Oak you had to go to Mount Moon to get your starter. Which kind of resembles a lot of characters from the anime, like Iris and Axew.
For me, Eevee isn't my favorite pokemon, but when you include its evolutionary line it feels like the most pokemon of any pokemon.
Yellow Ranger was masculine in the series that Saban spliced to make Mighty Morphin‚Äô. You‚Äôll notice only Pink‚Äôs suit has the little skirt.
Apparently the reason why spinda isn‚Äôt transferable is because the coding used for its spots were all done backwards. So it‚Äôs just straight up incompatible with home. Hope you didn‚Äôt get a shiny one
    It's not that Spinda is incompatible with HOME, but that Spinda from outside games are incompatible with BDSP and Spinda from BDSP... well, they can't go anywhere anyway. So you can bring a Spinda up into HOME, but then it's stuck there until Game Freak puts it in another game.

I honestly find it to be a profoundly offensive oversight that this bug has not been fixed. I personally don't care about Spinda at all, but every Pok√©mon is somebody's favorite and I feel terrible for anyone who might have transferred a Spinda to HOME from Gen VII who now cannot play with their beloved Pok√©mon. To me, that goes against the entire spirit of Pok√©mon.

I have a similar rant about Dexit, but it's basically the same point except longer so I won't bore anyone by going into that.
    It was transferrable at some point, because I got a pile in my home boxes. Trapped , I assume.
I understand fully and dont think it is wrong. 

I just want Ele-goats and am petty-mad because Gogoat is my top 5 favs
Locario and the Mystery of Mew you say?
    No, Lucario and mew. The Pokemons. The first one was HEAVILY featured both in the games and in the promotional material pre release of the games. You can see Lucario in a gym leader's team in DPP, In the champion's team in DPP and in the team of a beloved npc during his quest line. It was featured heavily in the anime, in the movies, and it's easily available as an egg halfway through the game. Lucario is effectively a mascot of gen 4, it's easily available but also very special and unique.

On the other hand mew was only featured in one movie during gen 1's lifespan. It's almost never mentioned in the game, featured only in descriptions, and normally it's not obtainable without a proper event or distribution, which incidentally happened only in Japan during the release of its own movie. It's eeriness, the not knowing whether it really existed or not, spawned a ton of playground theories. The mystique around it was part of its popularity.

It seems that they wanted to make a pokemon that was mysterious and elusive to obtain enough to create legends and theories about itself at the playgrounds, but that at the same time was at the forefront of that franchise, being basically everywhere in anime, movies and all promotional material. If you know that something REALLY EXISTS and what it can do, then it has no mystery left to reveal. 

Arceus is so beloved by the franchise because it was treated Like mew, something so legendary and elusive that it has an aura of mystery. It's barely mentioned in the games, impossible to obtain without an event that was never distributed, and only officially revealed with its own movie.
        Arceus is an example of Game Freak REALLY getting a Pok√©mon right. The Sinjoh Ruins event in HGSS is one of the weirdest and most memorable events in any Pok√©mon game. PLA also did a fantastic job making Arceus feel like... well, Arceus. If only every mythical could be so realized.
Also them not having an event in-game is pretty boring.

Think back to Gen 3, 4 and 5 (for victini at least) where you generally got an item and had to go somewhere in the world to obtain the pokemon.

That made the encounter much more special than "Insert code, receive mon, maybe get a conversation, like with Diancie"
    Even most if not all of the other Unova mythicals had *something* for them.  Keldeo had the little clearing to get Resolute Form.  Meloetta had the guy in Castelia who would play the relic song.  Even Genesect at least had the scientist who would give the different drives.
        Meloetta also had an [event](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok√©mon_Global_Link_promotions#Musical_shows) related for Pok√©mon Musical feature although its separate from getting the mythical. 

This obscure event is the only time that a Mythical is implied to be owned by a trainer in the main series game outside of the protagonist.
    Spoilers for Indigo Disk DLC:

>!I LOVE THE MELOETTA ENCOUNTER FOR THIS EXACT REASON! It's such an insanely complex and nonsensical way to encounter a Pok√©mon, but the result is a genuinely exciting encounter that had me cackling like a child even though I looked up a guide to get it. My ONE complaint about this encounter is that I really don't think you can figure it out on your own. SV does not really encourage you to talk to random NPCs, so you'll probably never get the hints. And even if you do, they don't spell things out super clearly, so I think it's unlikely anyone will organically encounter Meloetta without the internet telling them she's out there. But man, what an amazing moment that would be. I wish all Mythicals were obtained like this.!<
Heck if you‚Äôre going to gift them at least distribute them at lvl 10 or 20 so we can actually use them for a playthrough. Lvl 100 just ensures they‚Äôre never getting used
    The level 5 event Pokemon they briefly did were fucking rad. ORAS had a shiny Beldum with hold back (which is false swipe with a different name) so he was strong and good for catching. S&M followed that up with a munchlax with hold back, happy hour, metronome, and a Snorlax z-crystal. Z-Metronoming my way through the game was a blast.

More alt starters and less unique Pokemon with no substance pls, gamefreak.
This is why I like the Meloetta event in the indigo disc

You spin around like the peroette form , then use the sepia filter as a reference to the og black and white event where the guy talks about his sepia colored dreams , feels very gen 3 esque imo
The game won't even let you nickname them to make them feel personalized.
I think it's somewhat plausible.

It is not rare in the sense that there are just very few specimen of it, but because they live so deep in the jungle that most humans will probably never encounter them in their entire life.
Exactly - it wasn‚Äôt able to be obtained despite my looking for it and wanting to catch it. It wasn‚Äôt findable so it couldn‚Äôt be ‚Äúpart of the team‚Äù and get good memories
    They fixed that by having it on Route 1 in Ultra Sun/Moon with a 30% encounter rate in this one patch of grass. That was my second main line Pok√©mon game, and I had a Zorua on my team and fell in love with it.
Worked for Volcarona, that seems fairly popular (obviously not to the levels of Lucario, Charizard and Greninja).
    But Volcarona only worked once. Now you have to get a Larvesta and level it up like insane to get a Volcarona.
        I like to call that Gen 5 syndrome. (Seriously, level 59 for volcarona and 64 for hydreigon??)
        Volcarona can be obtained at level 35 in the mid game in BW2 but that‚Äôs an exception.
They already did it first with Riolu in gen 4, why they didn't try it again in gen 5?
    Heck, they give you a free Mega Lucario in gen 6
        It's funny how both XY and ORAS just gives you a free mega relatively early on

Yes I'm sure giving me a mega evolution when 90% of the game involves fights with mega-less trainers is a good idea lmao
They did this actually...in japan...I had a Japanese copy of white and was able to grab and raise it in game and then breed it and send an egg to an English copy of black once that came out!
    Thing is, a lot of people dont live in japan, thus not having access to japenese events, especially the kids that lived outside of japan. 
This is my biggest gripe with gamefreak, they run a bunch of really cool events within japan, shiny this, mythical that, and then just ignore the rest of the world when theres a decent playerbase everwhere else
[deleted]
    yeah rufflet or vullaby evolving around 50 is pretty bad in bw when get them after like 7th gym in mid to high 30's, but its far worse when find them early game in later games
    The real problem is that they actually had a good level curve and wanted you to have some time with the base versions before they evolve, at least for the birds and Deino, Larveresta has no excuse, they probably should have just been available to find earlier into the region, like do something like open up Marvelous Bridge but keep the version city closed around Driftveil and make them available there
I think this is part of why I love Milotic so much. I was that kid who spent eight hours straight hunting for a Feebas and then had a Milotic on my team during the story play. It made me a legend amongst my friends and Pok√©mon-playing peers, especially since I bred her and had multiple Milotic (and traded some Feebas for legendaries). I still have that first Milotic and she's still in Sapphire. :)
ORAS did it right giving Feebas a fixed tile to find it
Would disagree a bit with this point. Especially since the introduction of H-Zoroark into VGC. Although, I do wish there was no preview that would also mean an enormous uptick in Zoroark usage 

And it actually messes with ppls head (or not at all) when they see H-Zoroark in preview. I‚Äôll elaborate - players either do 1 or 2 things when they see Zoroark in my party 

1) Completely ignore or forget Zoroark was in my party which allows Zoroark additional turn(s) to either support or setup 

2) Over prepare or over analyze. (This involves switching a mon out or using a dark move when it would normally be ‚Äúnot very effective‚Äù)

Scenario #1 is far more common. Ppl very often just ignore or forget about Zoroark and still use fake out, close combat, drain punch, shadow ball (any normal, fighting, ghost type moves). Which ofc, H-Zoroark is immune to. 

H-Zoroark biggest strength in my party is still the element of surprise mostly bc ppl just don‚Äôt see him as a threat or get too caught up in several other strategies that are possible with my team and far more common in the VGC (and I do sometimes still use those strategies)

I‚Äôve never took a shot at regional or anything but every season I would make into a decent standing in Master Rank and always have an over .500 record. Certainly not in the top 100 every season but I‚Äôve gotten close and would say I‚Äôm at least capable
    Zoroark isn‚Äôt really a thing in vgc except for meme teams tbh. Even with illusion, it‚Äôs just not that good. You can def have fun with it on ladder and probably take it to some locals, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ever had any decent placements at higher level events. 

The meta is so hyper offensive that even resisted and neutral hits are removing it from the field.
Me when I missed Iron Leaves and Walking Wake with no promise of getting them again:
    Bruh theyre in tera raids rn.
Horsea was the small weak one that was actually smart. it got kidnapped once and used its Spitting ink to create a trail for the characters to follow if I remember correctly
    Pokemon was always a kids show, but reading this it's nice to remember how every Pokemon was unique, they all had their quarks, personality and attitude.
    Yep in the Eevolutions episode
Staryu was the best. HYAH!
You completely missed her Starmie which she typically reserved for utility rather than battle.  She had a powerful 'mon in her pocket most of the time though.
    I forgot she had both a Starmie AND a Staryu on her team.
Starmie in the corner here thinking "fine guess I'll just leave then".

No but for real, it always seemed like her Staryu was stronger from what I remember, which is pretty weird
I'd probably say Psyduck could be considered her mascot, at least up until Togepi arrives, due to it being so memorable for her. I suppose you could also argue it was her most powerful pokemon, it's just neither of them knew how to use that power at will. 

I always kind of saw Psyduck as a bit of a metaphor for Misty. Has a headache most of the time (both Psyduck and Ash gave Misty "headaches"), can have temper/rage outbursts, lives in the shadow of her more talented sisters (Psyduck and Misty's other pokemon), has untapped potential and strength and comes up clutch when needed and/or is least expected. I may have read too much into it all, but Psyduck seemed the perfect fit to me as her mascot or "pal" pokemon, with her ace, then, probably being Starmie.
Downfall is that Psyduvk's gag became stale fast and overshadowed her other Pokemon.

Oh she's gonna send out Starmie? Wrong, Psyduck.

Oh no Psyduck is massively outmatched? Jokes on you every time the opponent will play into the gag of hitting it until the headache power activates.
I remember those days. "Leaks" of PIKABLU and Ho-Oh. 

Looking for Mew under the truck for the umpteenth time. 

Watching ripped Japanese scenes of the Pokemon Mewtwo Movie.
    I remember the insane arguments about the weird looking Moltres in the anime lmao.
        In my circles it was well accepted that the Pokemon missing from the dex in the first episode of the anime was in fact Missing it's Number, thus Ho Oh is forever Missingno to me
    The Mew Truck thing sounded plausible if not likely.

The actual way to force a Mew spawn with the RNG and things like Nugget Bridge sounded like absolute bullshit but actually worked by gaming the coding lol
        I was convinced the keys in the game corner was connected to the truck to get mew as a kid. 


Now I know that the keys on a machine just means you went to crap and no one take my spot
    Ho-oh was in the first episode of the anime, too. They had years of plans already and probably just enjoyed watching Gen I squirm
It would've been so cool if they kept doing differently typed Pikaclones instead of clogging up the electric type with the same mon every gen
    Especially since a bunch are single evos. I‚Äôd be okay if we had another couple fully evolved lines of electric rodent.
        Like the Pawmi line, which is my favorite pika-clone in part because you can actually use them.
            I'm meh on the design but it's a neat typing and a neat concept.

However, it's also the only one where I agree that the evolution stages look way too similar, but that could be made worse by its debut in Paldea where it's a lot easier to mix up smaller 'mons.
the pikablu days were good days, so much excitement and hype!
The pok√©gods...
Even the trading cards for the first movie called it Pikablu. Also Snubull was Buru.
    That's probably worth a pretty penny now
It‚Äôs probably *because* of Marill‚Äôs unpopularity that they returned to Electric.
Changes the type of its signature move. When its full belly its electric type and when its hungry its dark type
    Ohhh thank you! I wanted to use Morpeko in my team in sword at one point but the constant switch made the battles take too long. So I just switched it out. Never noticed type change on its move.
Eevee wasn‚Äôt available in Black and White, the monkeys‚Äô debut games.
    Which only aupports the notion that they monkeys were there to fill that gap, but since Eevee is in every game since BW, the monkeys are surplus to requirements.
Exactly, I love yamper (I have a corgi IRL) but Bolthund is the most generic uninteresting dog Pok√©mon ever conceived
    I love Boltund personally (It's a dog so of course I will), but it's design is definitely just too generic dog to be more popular. Probably would've been smarter to just continue the corgi theme, especially since the breed is super popular nowadays (I had two when I was a kid).
        Bolthund always felt like it was trying to invoke a greyhound, which makes me wonder if historically dog racing was a thing in the inspiring region from real world or the in game region.

Edit: or just general foxhounds which when I looked them up were so painfully generic they look like what I would put as the ‚Äúdog‚Äù picture in a dictionary‚Ä¶ /smh
    I went into Sword and Shield without knowing too much about the game so I was so excited to catch Yamper. And then I evolved it and I boxed it. I was heartbroken üòü I was expecting it to stay a corgi and I was so let down!
yeah it should‚Äôve stayed a corgi or like evolved into a sheepdog looking dog instead also bolthund looks like weirdly bald idk not a fan of him as much as i love yamper
    Let's not forget the complete stat change on evolution either.  Yamper starts off with like, 29 base speed and then hits 121 on evolution.  You get this funny chonky corgi who seems like he'll be a bulky electric wall who ends up evolving into a completely separate dog breed that's a speed demon.

The juxtaposition between the two ideas is just jarring, especially on an animal that most people have a strong familiarity with.  We know dog breeds are distinct and different, and we saw a corgi then wanted a corgi.  But it evolves and essentially becomes a whole new concept unrelated to its base beyond "dog".

Yamper sucks because he's an example of one of the worst outcomes of evolution: becoming something so completely different or unexpected that the player gets disappointed since they liked the original idea.  It's not like Bug types either - we all know caterpillars become butterflies, so when Caterpie evolves we're already fully on board to see that drastic change.

No one was expecting that from not only a dog, but a dog breed that's so iconic to the region the game took inspiration from.
        yeah like there‚Äôs lots of british dogs they could‚Äôve used but bolthund is like just generic dog it doesn‚Äôt seem like any breed particularly also maybe it‚Äôs in the dex or smth idk but yamper and its evo should‚Äôve had some sorta rivalry with wololo since corgis are sheepdogs and farm shit like that is pretty big in the uk also ur right it should‚Äôve kept bulky and used a shetland sheepdog as a base like it could‚Äôve used its fur to hold electricity and shock anyone that tried to attack (lore wise good excuse to give it high defence) i feel like dog mons get done kinda dirty like cat mons are usually really well designed

            What are you talking about, Boltund's clearly a greyhound.
            I love the idea of a Sheltie Yamper evo! It feels like a much more natural progression both in visuals and inspirations.
    Its because bolthund is a super hero and the fox thing was the villian. They both look idiotic because mascot concept look trumps generally interesting design.
        ohhh that makes a little more sense i liked the fox a lot thought tbh it felt like an old school pokemon
            Nicket is adorable. The second form looks dumb
It was just randomly added to Ultra Sun and Moon. The only memorable thing about it was that shiny event in Generation 8.

Despite that, Zarude is probably the Mythical that is the least memorable outside of Phione.
    At least Zarude has that dumb alternate form, but the competition between those two as most unnecessary mythical is still a close competition.
    The randomness of when it came out. It felt like everyone was already moving on from US/UM, and then they just throw this mythical out there like "hey, we forgot we had this thing, so, ugh, here you go."

It's like the exact opposite of Zygarde, where they built up this big thing that everyone thought would lead to a game version Pokemon Z, but they said "haha, Sike. Wait until next Gen so we can shoehorn Zygarde lore in there since we are ~~too lazy to make~~ going to surprise everyone by not making a Z version."
        I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the 20th anniversary is why the developers didn‚Äôt make Pokemon Z.
    Phione/Manaphy and Zeraora also should have been dual typed. Electric fists? If it was our first electric fighting it would have at least that going for it.
Also Azumarill gets fairy typing but Manaphy doesn't??
        GF seems dislike adding new type to legenday/mythical Pokemon.
            Volcanion is the only water/fire Pokemon though
                I think they were referring to the fact that they would‚Äôve had to have added fairy type to manaphy retroactively. There‚Äôs several Gen 1-5 mythicals that gamefreak could have believably added fairy type to, and they didn‚Äôt add it to any of them - so it seems like they made a conscious decision that they *weren‚Äôt* going to do that.
Mythicals are way overdone. I think there should be a max of 2 per region (and it's really best to go with just 1). Zeraora also doesn't look mythical to me. It looks great (I actually like its design more than Lucario's), but the second I learned it was mythical... meh, lost interest.
    I liked mythicals when they have like... you know, reasoning for being one.



Zeraora and Volcanion dont have reasons on what they are. They just exist. 

Its not like Magearna or Diancie whos a manmade creation or a mutation.

Nor like Marshadow whos the rainbow feather guardian.
That grows fast and can learn almost everything. And looks awesome!
>Because otherwise it wouldn't be able to add weather ball to its moveset. You would have to get rid of one of the weather moves to include sandstorm instead and that would still lock you out of one of its transformations.
 
Can you elaborate? My brain is having a hard time understanding why this wouldn't work.
    Sunny Day, Rain Dance, Hail, Weather Ball. That fills all four move slots. So if he had a Sandstorm form, you‚Äôd have to give up on one of the other three forms or your only attacking move.
        Or the trainer could just pick which weather moves to have on it at any given time‚Ä¶
My Castform‚Äôs four moves were Sunny Day, Flamethrower, Weather Ball, and Thunderbolt, so the 4-move argument literally doesn‚Äôt hold water for me‚Ä¶
r/unexpectedoffice
Ho-oh was in the first ep so Marill is actually third then.
like coulve used golem, instead of atleast 1 of the onix.

Since rhydon was for giovanni adn your rival
    not to mention it‚Äôs even worse cuz he uses two of them‚Äîreplace one with poliwrath or primeape, and it‚Äôd still be much better than its actual form

hell, even if we want to go beyond rock types or the golem option, electabuzz strikes me as on-theme based on its significant arms. Pinsir, Kangaskhan, Exsecutor

if we‚Äôre keeping it open to pokemon other trainers use, both nidos and rhydon would also be good
        >Pinsir, Kangaskhan, Exsecutor

Pinsir and Kangaskhan are cool suggestions, but I can't wrap my head around how you came up with giving Bruno an Exeggutor.
        The Elite 4 should have been considered dual type specialists from the start. Lorelei would have officially been ice/water, Bruno as fighting/rock, Agatha as ghost/poison, and Lance as dragon/flying. It would have helped them stand out from the gym leaders who stick to one type, and since Lance would no longer be coy with half of his team being flying types, we couldn‚Äôt rag on him for being a ‚Äúdragon‚Äù trainer.
Young me assumed that the Onixes were to counter your beefed-out Pidgeot that you'd had since early game.
I mean you'd have a point if the "wildcard" pokemon were actually strong pokemon. But practically every run I've seen (and I've been watching a LOT of Red and Blue runs lately, shoutout to JROSE11) the Onixes are always one-shots. Hell, plenty of times he sets up stat-boosts against them because they're so weak they don't pose a threat. 

MAYBE you could say Poliwrath would be beaten by whatever Grass or Electric type you used to sweep Lorelei, but Grass will still sweep Onix. If you want Electric coverage, than sub one for a Golem. Maybe a Marowak.
Victory road is all the way over there though
"Change my view"
Jigglypuff also got the Smash Bros popularity bump too.
    that‚Äôs bcs of the anime popularity buff tho tbf
        It definitely could have influenced it a little bit, but from my understanding Sakurai really loved Kirby and wanted a second fighter with a similar model.
            >Sakurai really loved Kirby

of course, Kirby is Sakurai's creation
Clefairy actually is more viable than Clefable in the officially competitive format which is neat!
But instead of getting it from Professor Oak you had to go to Mount Moon to get your starter. Which kind of resembles a lot of characters from the anime, like Iris and Axew.
It's not that Spinda is incompatible with HOME, but that Spinda from outside games are incompatible with BDSP and Spinda from BDSP... well, they can't go anywhere anyway. So you can bring a Spinda up into HOME, but then it's stuck there until Game Freak puts it in another game.

I honestly find it to be a profoundly offensive oversight that this bug has not been fixed. I personally don't care about Spinda at all, but every Pok√©mon is somebody's favorite and I feel terrible for anyone who might have transferred a Spinda to HOME from Gen VII who now cannot play with their beloved Pok√©mon. To me, that goes against the entire spirit of Pok√©mon.

I have a similar rant about Dexit, but it's basically the same point except longer so I won't bore anyone by going into that.
It was transferrable at some point, because I got a pile in my home boxes. Trapped , I assume.
No, Lucario and mew. The Pokemons. The first one was HEAVILY featured both in the games and in the promotional material pre release of the games. You can see Lucario in a gym leader's team in DPP, In the champion's team in DPP and in the team of a beloved npc during his quest line. It was featured heavily in the anime, in the movies, and it's easily available as an egg halfway through the game. Lucario is effectively a mascot of gen 4, it's easily available but also very special and unique.

On the other hand mew was only featured in one movie during gen 1's lifespan. It's almost never mentioned in the game, featured only in descriptions, and normally it's not obtainable without a proper event or distribution, which incidentally happened only in Japan during the release of its own movie. It's eeriness, the not knowing whether it really existed or not, spawned a ton of playground theories. The mystique around it was part of its popularity.

It seems that they wanted to make a pokemon that was mysterious and elusive to obtain enough to create legends and theories about itself at the playgrounds, but that at the same time was at the forefront of that franchise, being basically everywhere in anime, movies and all promotional material. If you know that something REALLY EXISTS and what it can do, then it has no mystery left to reveal. 

Arceus is so beloved by the franchise because it was treated Like mew, something so legendary and elusive that it has an aura of mystery. It's barely mentioned in the games, impossible to obtain without an event that was never distributed, and only officially revealed with its own movie.
    Arceus is an example of Game Freak REALLY getting a Pok√©mon right. The Sinjoh Ruins event in HGSS is one of the weirdest and most memorable events in any Pok√©mon game. PLA also did a fantastic job making Arceus feel like... well, Arceus. If only every mythical could be so realized.
Even most if not all of the other Unova mythicals had *something* for them.  Keldeo had the little clearing to get Resolute Form.  Meloetta had the guy in Castelia who would play the relic song.  Even Genesect at least had the scientist who would give the different drives.
    Meloetta also had an [event](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok√©mon_Global_Link_promotions#Musical_shows) related for Pok√©mon Musical feature although its separate from getting the mythical. 

This obscure event is the only time that a Mythical is implied to be owned by a trainer in the main series game outside of the protagonist.
Spoilers for Indigo Disk DLC:

>!I LOVE THE MELOETTA ENCOUNTER FOR THIS EXACT REASON! It's such an insanely complex and nonsensical way to encounter a Pok√©mon, but the result is a genuinely exciting encounter that had me cackling like a child even though I looked up a guide to get it. My ONE complaint about this encounter is that I really don't think you can figure it out on your own. SV does not really encourage you to talk to random NPCs, so you'll probably never get the hints. And even if you do, they don't spell things out super clearly, so I think it's unlikely anyone will organically encounter Meloetta without the internet telling them she's out there. But man, what an amazing moment that would be. I wish all Mythicals were obtained like this.!<
The level 5 event Pokemon they briefly did were fucking rad. ORAS had a shiny Beldum with hold back (which is false swipe with a different name) so he was strong and good for catching. S&M followed that up with a munchlax with hold back, happy hour, metronome, and a Snorlax z-crystal. Z-Metronoming my way through the game was a blast.

More alt starters and less unique Pokemon with no substance pls, gamefreak.
They fixed that by having it on Route 1 in Ultra Sun/Moon with a 30% encounter rate in this one patch of grass. That was my second main line Pok√©mon game, and I had a Zorua on my team and fell in love with it.
But Volcarona only worked once. Now you have to get a Larvesta and level it up like insane to get a Volcarona.
    I like to call that Gen 5 syndrome. (Seriously, level 59 for volcarona and 64 for hydreigon??)
    Volcarona can be obtained at level 35 in the mid game in BW2 but that‚Äôs an exception.
Heck, they give you a free Mega Lucario in gen 6
    It's funny how both XY and ORAS just gives you a free mega relatively early on

Yes I'm sure giving me a mega evolution when 90% of the game involves fights with mega-less trainers is a good idea lmao
Thing is, a lot of people dont live in japan, thus not having access to japenese events, especially the kids that lived outside of japan.

    >Pinsir, Kangaskhan, Exsecutor

Pinsir and Kangaskhan are cool suggestions, but I can't wrap my head around how you came up with giving Bruno an Exeggutor.
    The Elite 4 should have been considered dual type specialists from the start. Lorelei would have officially been ice/water, Bruno as fighting/rock, Agatha as ghost/poison, and Lance as dragon/flying. It would have helped them stand out from the gym leaders who stick to one type, and since Lance would no longer be coy with half of his team being flying types, we couldn‚Äôt rag on him for being a ‚Äúdragon‚Äù trainer.
that‚Äôs bcs of the anime popularity buff tho tbf
    It definitely could have influenced it a little bit, but from my understanding Sakurai really loved Kirby and wanted a second fighter with a similar model.
        >Sakurai really loved Kirby

of course, Kirby is Sakurai's creation
Arceus is an example of Game Freak REALLY getting a Pok√©mon right. The Sinjoh Ruins event in HGSS is one of the weirdest and most memorable events in any Pok√©mon game. PLA also did a fantastic job making Arceus feel like... well, Arceus. If only every mythical could be so realized.
Meloetta also had an [event](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok√©mon_Global_Link_promotions#Musical_shows) related for Pok√©mon Musical feature although its separate from getting the mythical. 

This obscure event is the only time that a Mythical is implied to be owned by a trainer in the main series game outside of the protagonist.
I like to call that Gen 5 syndrome. (Seriously, level 59 for volcarona and 64 for hydreigon??)
Volcarona can be obtained at level 35 in the mid game in BW2 but that‚Äôs an exception.
It's funny how both XY and ORAS just gives you a free mega relatively early on

Yes I'm sure giving me a mega evolution when 90% of the game involves fights with mega-less trainers is a good idea lmao
In my circles it was well accepted that the Pokemon missing from the dex in the first episode of the anime was in fact Missing it's Number, thus Ho Oh is forever Missingno to me
I was convinced the keys in the game corner was connected to the truck to get mew as a kid. 


Now I know that the keys on a machine just means you went to crap and no one take my spot
Like the Pawmi line, which is my favorite pika-clone in part because you can actually use them.
    I'm meh on the design but it's a neat typing and a neat concept.

However, it's also the only one where I agree that the evolution stages look way too similar, but that could be made worse by its debut in Paldea where it's a lot easier to mix up smaller 'mons.
Bolthund always felt like it was trying to invoke a greyhound, which makes me wonder if historically dog racing was a thing in the inspiring region from real world or the in game region.

Edit: or just general foxhounds which when I looked them up were so painfully generic they look like what I would put as the ‚Äúdog‚Äù picture in a dictionary‚Ä¶ /smh
yeah like there‚Äôs lots of british dogs they could‚Äôve used but bolthund is like just generic dog it doesn‚Äôt seem like any breed particularly also maybe it‚Äôs in the dex or smth idk but yamper and its evo should‚Äôve had some sorta rivalry with wololo since corgis are sheepdogs and farm shit like that is pretty big in the uk also ur right it should‚Äôve kept bulky and used a shetland sheepdog as a base like it could‚Äôve used its fur to hold electricity and shock anyone that tried to attack (lore wise good excuse to give it high defence) i feel like dog mons get done kinda dirty like cat mons are usually really well designed

    What are you talking about, Boltund's clearly a greyhound.
    I love the idea of a Sheltie Yamper evo! It feels like a much more natural progression both in visuals and inspirations.
ohhh that makes a little more sense i liked the fox a lot thought tbh it felt like an old school pokemon
    Nicket is adorable. The second form looks dumb
I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the 20th anniversary is why the developers didn‚Äôt make Pokemon Z.
GF seems dislike adding new type to legenday/mythical Pokemon.
    Volcanion is the only water/fire Pokemon though
        I think they were referring to the fact that they would‚Äôve had to have added fairy type to manaphy retroactively. There‚Äôs several Gen 1-5 mythicals that gamefreak could have believably added fairy type to, and they didn‚Äôt add it to any of them - so it seems like they made a conscious decision that they *weren‚Äôt* going to do that.
Or the trainer could just pick which weather moves to have on it at any given time‚Ä¶
