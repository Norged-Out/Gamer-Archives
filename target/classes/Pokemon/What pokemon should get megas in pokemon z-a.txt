[[What pokemon should get megas in pokemon z-a]]


Just want some options and don’t make it your favourite just because please like personally I think like volcarona or gliscor because there really interesting but what you opinion but i think that if we get another charizard mega im honestly quitting or make more starter megas like the unova starters(VERY underrated) or the new paradoxes but that’s just me 


Personally, I want a Mega-Gliscor.
    Agreed
I need terrible Pokémon to get them. Where is my Shedinja? Where is my Beheeyem? I love Lurantis, but it does unfortunately suck.
    Mega Shedinja, now with 2 HP!
        Mega Shedinja: it can only take damage from critical hits.
            *laughs in Frost Breath*
            Abilities weren't in Arceus so if they even add Shedinja to a Legends game it's basically screwed unless they just get rid of the 1HP only thing.
                They had a special ability for regigigas so it's not impossible they code specifically for shedinja too
Although I think its more likely he's just not included
                    I forgot that.

Poor Regigigas can never catch a break.
                Regigigas still had Slow Start and Cherrim could transform into its Sunny Form (or whatever the name is). So PLA had abilities in some ways
            Mega Shedninja. It becomes pure Ghost type. Which would only give it a weakness to Dark, Ghost, and Fairy.

The ability stays the same and so does it's HP.
                fairy is not super effective against ghost
                Or it becomes Ghost and Dark, with fairy as its only weakness.

I know that about the HP, it was a joke for that.
    Beeheeyem should get a third stage imo
        Beheeyem is already perfection and I have zero optimism towards new evolutions anymore
            None of the new ones did anything for you?

Not even Hydrapple?
                I feel like when you start off with something I don't care for, you're not likely to end up with something I like. I think that was present even just with Alolan forms. The jump from a lot of these older Pokémon to a new evolution is large. Even without that, something like Kingambit is just ugly. Hydrapple is fine, one generation means those issues don't really come up. I kind of just think a good amount of these have the kind of exaggerated design differences Mega Evolution was known for. Then again, even in Gen IV, a few of those new evolutions stunk.
        What kind of alien would it be named after?
            I have seen multiple fan designs

    SHUCKLE!
    Dunsparce. Dududunsparce. Now with a third thorax
hahah another charizard mega hahah right guys

(it’s going to happen anyway and we all know it)
    as it has been written, so shall it be done
Pokemon whose counterpart gotten one. So Froslass, slowking. Butterfree already gotten a gmax form (but gengar has both so maybe?)

Machamp and golem still have not gotten one to complete the kanto trade evolution quad.

As for kalos pokemon, aces of gym leaders, elite four, and lysandre would be good.

Not sure about other starters, but if they are in the game, why not
The Kalos starters. It was supposed *their* region's own gimmick.
Besides Flygon?

I’d love the following:

Ariados

Kingdra

Aegislash

Marowak

Exploud

Tropius

Lunatone/solrock

Walrein

Shuckle

Hydreigon

Nidoking/Queen

Dewgong

Crobat

Jynx

Crawdaunt

And lastly, the legendary dogs
    Jynx to Joynx
        Hijinx
            Better
    Flygon and Walrein megas please. I wanted them so much when ORAS came out.
    AND mega electivire and magmortar
    aegislash would be awesome
        Even cooler, would be 2 Mega's, one full attack with Sword, and one full defense as a giant shield.

Also, Dhelmise.
            That would be a dope idea for an X and Y form, if they do those in ZA
    All great suggestions. Don’t see the legendary dogs getting them since they just got paradox forms
        Ahhh, completely forgot they received those lol I haven’t played SV
    Excellent spread here mmmm yes delectable
    What a great list 💯💯
    This is a really good list
    They’re legendary cats
Dragonite so we can finally obtain Dragoniteite.   
Or, a Kalos pokemon without an evolutionary line like Furfrou or Klefki.
    I’m also hoping for Mega Yanmega.
Glancing the both pokedex again since it's been a minute;

Legends Arceus had 27 new forms and mons.

7 new mons

4 new forms (3 are legendary Pokémon)

16 regionals.


So by that metric as a baseline...

Give 3 regionals to the ZA starters. (3)

Butterfree and Slowking a Mega (5)

The kalos starters a Mega (8) and a battle bond form (10)

Aegislash and Talonflame gets a Mega (12)

Machoke, Charjabug, Gothirita, and Furret get a Kalos regional evolution  (16)

Xerneas and Yveltal get a new form (18)

Gabite and Garchomp get a new regional and a Mega for that form (21)

Galarian Legendary Birds ride again, with a new bird and new regional forms for Ho-oh and Lugia to match (24)

Volcanion gets a Mega (25)

Corviknight gets a regional (26) and Tinkatink gets a regional line to match (28)



So like

8 Megas, 5 new mons, 4 new forms, 11 regionals



Tldr

Slowking, Butterfree, the Kalos starters, and some Kalos mons should get the Mega treatment. 

If Arceus is anything to go by *the new mons will also be the bosses*, so there's gotta be some balance.
All of them. It won’t be game breaking because you can’t do multiplayer in Legends anyway
    This is my thought too. Also we already know megas aren't forever, so might as well just give it to every fully evolved mon they include in the game.
Any Pokémon that doesn’t have anything to them, like no evolutions and no alternate forms. But Eevee evolving into Eeveeon and then mega evolving would be cool
Milotic? Give Wallace's ace a Mega evolution 🥹
Oranguru. No real reason it would just be cool and Oranguru deserves more attention anyway, it’s so underrated.
Mega swellow, why not
Nidoqueen & Nidoking

Arcanine

Golem

Lapras

Dragonite

Meganium, Typhlosion & Feraligatr

Noctowl

Crobat

Politoed

Kingdra

Flygon

Milotic

Staraptor

Luxray

Toxicroak

Krookodile

Zoroark

Chandelure

Haxorus

Braviary & Mandibuzz

Hydreigon

Talonflame

Gogoat

Heliolisk

Decidueye, Incineroar & Primarina

Lycanroc
Jynx so we can get a third ice type
We DEFINITELY need Mega Flutter Mane:

Ghost/Fairy with ability of Shadow Tag.

45/45/45/205/205/205
    750 BST

why do you hate everyone
    you are aware that mega evolutions get +100 total to base stats, not +180? 

why would flutter mane need a mega when it's already absurdly OP? give the little guys some love.
Gyarados and Glalie both received Mega Evolutions while Milotic and Froslass didn’t, which was and still is a travesty imo!

Just to throw some design ideas out there, Mega Milotic could be a Water/Fairy-type based on the rainbow serpent of Australian Aboriginal creationism and Mega Froslass could be based off of intricate wedding kimono… justice for the pretty Pokémon whose masculine counterparts got Mega Evolutions!!!

Mega Lurantis or Salazzle would be fun too!
    mega gothitelle and reuniclus too
Parasec
    And for the love of Arceus please finally give it a physical grass move
I assume we will at vare minimum get 28 brand new Mega Evolutions since that is the amount X and Y introduced. It makes sense to me that most are Gen 6 with gen 5,7, and 8, receiving a few as well above because Gen 1-4 were the ones to get the most back in Gen 6.

Out of those 28. 6 of them are practically guaranteed. The 3 Kalos starters, Xerneas and Yveltal, come on these 5 need to happen and Flygon, because he was originally planned to have one.

Others from Gen 6 that seem very likely are Goodra, Noivern, Hawlucha, Heliolisk, Aegislash, Florges, Pangoro, Gogoat, and meowstic These seem like the most popular Gen 6 pokemon and most likely to get Megas.

As fir Gen 5, 7, and 8, I have no idea I hope we get completely unexpected ones like no one will expect Drampa to get one, for example but they will probably focus on the popular ones with a few weird ones.
Haxorus!!!
All the starters
I would love a ninetales similar to the mega alakazam and psychic type.

Edit: I realise i probably just described mega delphox my heart wants both.
Something truly unhinged that can only exist in the past before an extinction level event, like Haxorus or Dragonite
Dragonite, snorlax, lapras
johto starters
I'd love for Dragonite to get a mega but let's be honest, he didnt get one because he is plump and without flaw

Big squishy orange boi
I am biased, but Linoone. I just wanna see what a Mega Linoone could look like. Lol.

(I don't expect it, but it *is* possible since Zigzagoon is native to Kalos)
Ferrothorn
Durant
Tinkaton
Klinklang
Bronzong
Mega Octillery where it becomes a giant squid nuke and Mega Clefable with it's wings actually working now giving it the flying type
I want a mega Breloom with just a higher speed stat and maybe higher bulk but mostly more speed, why? It has access to spore and it'd be hilarious to outspeed a lot of Pokemon while putting them to sleep
Mega Dugtrio, where it comes out of the ground and has an insane body
Personally I'd like to see megas for weaker pokemon and gen 6 pokemon cause u know they only 1 got it and it's a legendary.

Gogoat, Heliolisk, Meowstic, Pangoro and Malamar for gen 6.

Breloom, Dusknoir, Froslass, Scolipede and maybe Mimikyu just to see what is underneath. Pls no gen 1, they have enough stuff
kalos and alola starters
All of them. Seriously what's stopping them from doing that? They have the money and resources to sink extra effort into it.
Mega Dragonite, holding a... Dragonite.
I just don't want pokemon with no evolution whatsoever or with just one evolution stage to get a mega. Otherwise they'll be doomed to never be able to evolve further.
Florgess
Gen 6 should have its own mega forms honestly.
togekiss
Porygon  - what's the step beyond Z?
    Obviously after Z is Z-A
Everyone except Charizard
How about Pokemon that were weak before? I don’t need a already strong Pokemon become even stronger.
Flygon for sure. 

I still hate that in the lore most every mega (except maybe Slowbro) is in pain and unhappy that they are mega form.

It feels very counter productive when friendship is what drives the mega evolution.
Scolipede might be cool
Zangoose and seviper
Mega Ledian that becomes Bug/Steel, and looks like a Mega Zord version of itself.
Serperior if Snivy ends up being one of the starters
Mewtwo and Charizard
The Johto and Unova starters. For a long time, they struggle competitively and arguably still do.
Haxorus. Gen 5 needs more mega evos, it only has 1 and it’s Audino. Haxorus was that one pokemon we all thought was a pseudo legendary as a kid, it’s also metal as fuck so yeah. 

Krookadile, Eelektross, Chandelurr are some other gen 5 mons that could get megas
sunflora
Mega Tropius or riot
Froslass and slowking
Mega samurott would make me religious
    Very unlikely since it already got a regional form in the last (and first) Legends game, tho.
Gen 6 starters. Always felt weird that they didn't get megas in the gen that introduced the concept, while gen 1 and 3 starters got it.
Give us M-Zangoose and M-Seviper
Any Kalos Pokemon. How tf are you gonna have a region specific mechanic, but none of the native mons have megas?
    Mega forms were originally made to give past Pokemon a new look, mostly given to weak Pokemon like Kangaskhan and Mawile who were known to be awful Pokemon. However, it would make a lot of sense for some Kalos Pokemon to receive megas now since they aren’t new Pokemon anymore
The kalos starters. Should have had them from the beginning.
Seviper and zangoose. Also Groudon and Kyogre
Any but Flygon
I want a Mega Gliscor, Lanturn or Flygon
Gen 5 Pokemon centric
Excadrill, musharna, garbodor, gothitelle, vespiqueen, dragalge would be cool too
Mega dynamax charizard
Personally, diggersby. Just because that’s my favorite pokemon.
Froslass never got a mega she deserves it
Xatu, I need a full totem pole of my boi
All of them. The fact that they don't is stupid imo.
Sylveon
Yanmega to a dragon bug with the legendary nickname mega yan
Flygon

All the starters, ideally.
Flygon, and the Gen 6 fossils
Mega charizard x needs a mega
Yanmega
Dragonite (ite-ite hype)

Mightyena

FLYGON

Lapras

Lugia & Ho-Oh

Nidoking & Nidoqueen

Luxray

Swellow & Noctowl
Megas of all the starters that didn't get a mega, plz and thx.
Give flygon the “pseudo” of the region + s mega evolution pls & ty
Agreed
Mega Shedinja, now with 2 HP!
    Mega Shedinja: it can only take damage from critical hits.
