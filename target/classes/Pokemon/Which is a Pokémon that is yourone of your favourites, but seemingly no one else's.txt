[[Which is a Pok√©mon that is yourone of your favourites, but seemingly no one else's]]


A Pok√©mon that you absolutely adore but that everyone else seemingly dislikes or even just straight up forgets about.


Mine is probably Garbodor. I think it was an awesome modern take on Muk, but people seem to absolutely hate it. I also prefer Omastar to Kabutops which no one else seems to agree with.


What's yours?


The anime made me love Cacnea and Carnivine they are so adorable and wholesome but not many talk about them¬†
    In my last few plays of Ruby/Saph/Emer, Cacnea has been an auto pickup. Faint attack/Pin missile are so clutch as rocking out most monsters.
        >rocking out most monsters. 

You know, I've never thought of that, but they do give good rock vibes. Would go to a rock show with them.
    Aahh I was going to say Carnivine as well ‚ù§Ô∏è
    James and Cacnea are so cute!! Same with Jesse and Dustox :)
    I love both of them and shiny Cacnea is my favorite color.
    Cacturne was a mainstay on my OG *Ruby*/*Emerald* runs. He made the journey to my switch just a few weeks ago. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
    Speaking of James, my answer is Chimecho. My all time favorite Pok√©mon, and it‚Äôs all because of its derpy antics with James
    carnivines neat looking but i just cant get behind such a useless pokemon gameplay wise
    It's not my number 1 but I'm a certified Cacturn appreciator.
    Honestly every pokemon Team Rocket used, I loved
    They are cool/cute looking, plus Cacturne isn't bad in SV.
Although my only complaint is when you look under Cacturns hat and it's less creepy looking. XD
But it does look cute still
    i was gonna say!  I love Cacnea and Shroomish in the Gen 3 anime
Dewgong, cute little thing :3
    Oh it's just a big seal pfft how tough could it be

*dewgong used aurora beam

Me watching my health bar slowly inch to 0 ü§î
    One if the most forgotten in Gen 1 for sure
        Seaking says hi
            At least Seaking has the whole  "FUCK YEAH SEAKING" meme
                What?

                        What is this lol
        It scarred 8 year old me for life. I don't know how many times I had to train to finally beat that Aurora Beam!! Love that 'mon though.
    Dewgong is great! I've used it in a few playthroughs and while it's not the strongest pokemon, I think many would be surprised how useable it actually is. Also it just looks nice!
    This is one of those ones that slipped under the radar in the main games but I now see as super strong because pokemon go. There‚Äôs a few. It‚Äôs funny because I picked up the main games a few months back and was going to rock a meta Pogo pick but realized it sucked. My idea of good pokemon is warped now.
    I always loved Dewgong as a little kid whenever I saw it on TV! I had never played the game but I just saw this gorgeous white seal and was immediately sold!
    That TV evolution to DewwwwGONGgonggong is forever etched into my brain.
    Another Dewgong lover.  We do exist
    i love that fella too, not my favorite but definitely close!
    Dewgong!!! i love Dewgong!! one of my first cards was one. it was fake and you could definitely tell but man i love it to bits <33
Oddish! Liked oddish since I was a 90s kid. Dunno why.
    Oddish has the face of a friend c:
    Because oddish a cute
    Gloom is my homie
    Oddish is so good. The whole line is 10/10 honestly, *and* you get to choose from different evos!
    I love the Oddish line
    One of my first favorites because it was one of the first I learned how to draw!
    people don't like Oddish??
    THIS RIGHT HERE
    Hope you watched the TCG Animations that have Oddish as main star
    Oddish is so cool. What a funky little guy.
    Oddish holds a place in my heart after it became my first legit shiny on Pok√©mon Emerald, after that I started trying to use Oddish more often and I fell in love with Vileplume and Bellosom
    Oddish is amazing! Just look at that friendly little guy!
    I have a class pet oddish. The kids fight to take him home on the weekends.
Donphan has been my boy since day 1
    People don‚Äôt like Donphan? I‚Äôve always thought he was cool since seeing him for the first time in the movie. He was one of my first Pok√©mon ever when I played through Gold as a kid
    Phanpy is one of my all time favorite pokemon, so I'm on board üëç
    How do you feel about it two paradox forms out of nowhere? Always wanted to ask a Donphan fan about this.
        Don't care much for paradox forms (S/V in general, actually). But as a raging paleonerd, i fell in love with Great Tusk. Can't say the same for Iron Treads though.
        I like Donphan but I just don‚Äôt love Paradox forms. Really don‚Äôt care for either of his either. Idk‚Ä¶ these features are just seemingly the norm now, and I haven‚Äôt loved anything outside of Megas. I‚Äôm ready for a no-gimmick gen, but I‚Äôm not holding my breath.
            Both paradox forms are pretty good imo but donphan really needs an evolution to keep up with the power curve.

The paradox forms serve as a straight upgrade, but would work better as a split evolution. Especially in a game with phanphy as an early ground type encounter; going through most of the game with a normal phanphy/donphan only to ditch it near the end when the paradox is available feels bad in practice.
        Donphan was always one of my favorites. I kind of like the new forms. I have the past form on my scarlett team, don't care as much about the future paradox form
    The worst part about donphan is that it's shiny should have been pink. The white is nice, but a baby pink elephant and a baby blue elephant just works.
Don't think Brambleghast has many fans, I am one of them
    In a playthrough it was absolutely a great speedy Ghost/Grass that surprisingly hit hard when I used it. Very good would recommend.

Speaking of Ghost types no one mentions a lot: Cofagrigus and Jellicent are awesome. Everyone mentions the other two Gen 5 Ghosts Chandelure and Golurk, but Imhotep and Pringles are great too.
        Jellicient superiority.
        I always name my male jellicents MUSTACHIO. I love my squishy spooky boy
    BRAMBLEGHAST I FOUND ANOTHER PERSON WHO LOVES BRAMBLEGHAST YES YES YES I LOVE BRAMBLEGHAST!!!
    I fucking love Brambleghast. SV had plenty of issues for sure, but one of the things it (and presumably SwSh but I didn't play those) got right is the overworld Pokemon. I avoided as many spoilers as possible, and walking through the desert and seeing Bramblin was amazing. Tumbling on its side like a real tumbleweed. It was obviously grass, but I didn't know what else, and was a little surprised when i tried to use tackle or something and found out it was ghost as well. Ghost is also my favorite type, so this was a sure lock in for my team. Those little moments of discovery, this one in particular, are what really made SV and I remember that way more than the 2 frame character animations (but if I dwell on those too long I might start to sour again).
    I love Brambleghast, picked it up in Scarlet and love it since.
Tropius gang unite!!!
    tropius deserves a buff
        First time I ever saw a Trpoius I thought it was gonna be strong AF. Like pseudo level cause of how cool its design is. I was mistaken.
            U might enjoy radical red. Idk if it's brilliant in it but it's definitely better lmao
        Tropius deserved an Alolan form with different fruit.
    Loved that it was roaming the plains in Violet.
    Tropius is the GOAT, it needs a buff so badly

When I was playing Blue Rescue Team as a kid, I managed to defeat Rayquaza thanks to a Tropius I recruited in one of the floors. Sacrificed themselves so I could land the final blow ü´°
    Randbats on pokemon showdown made me despise itüíÄ Its a banger design tho
    I posted Tropius without even checking to see if anyone else had said the same because my Dino Friend never gets any love.
    It was a cool Pokemon who was also an elite HM slave. I have fond memories of it.
Sawsbuck
    I wish you could watch one sawsuck change with the seasons
    Finally, a fellow Sawsbuck enjoyer!
        I was so happy to find deerling in gen9
    Love this mon
    Sawsbuck's season forms is such a cool concept. Autumn is my favourite
    I think it's very dumb how hard it is to get the different seasons outside of black/white. I remember getting my hands on some transferred ones in X/Y and mass breeding them. 

I get that the seasons mechanic is gone, but could they not replace it with anything? Randomize the wild encounters? Randomize eggs hatching? Set it based on route hatched on, or even the route you're fighting on? A held item, a consumable item, a random NPC, *anything*!
gastrodon / shellos in general are easily in my top five
    Shellos is adorable
        https://preview.redd.it/xl2ysgyiauvc1.jpeg?width=1929&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e490c3f68ec269227c61239a3a8b40e5bbc18c4b
    I love the little sea slugs
    Gastro boys a good
    Every game they‚Äôre in I almost always have them on my team
    I don't think this is a forgotten pokemon at all. It's very well liked
    I‚Äôm using him for the first time on my current run of platinum and I LOVE him!
Galvantula. Not especially hated, but no one else I know seems to love it as much as I do
    Fluffy spido boy a best
    I love the fuzzy bug boy. Everyone only talks about how cute Joltik is, but Galvantula is a solid mon with great supporting moves.
        Indeed! And I just love his design and type combo
    Big fan
        Elektross. Its only weakness is mold breaker!
    Huge Galvantula fan. Only bug I like!
        Awesome mon. I'm a huge bug type enjoyer, but this one might just be my favorite
    I respect it. Compound Eyes Thunder is not okay
Purugly. It's fat, it's ugly, and I find it kinda cute I dunno why
    That's a lot of pets in real life, mostly dogs, but there are some famous abominations of the feline variety that are still loved.
        As a dog owner and fan‚Ä¶ yeah, there‚Äôs dog breeds whose existence I pity.

Like, pugs actually enjoy being intubated while conscious. Animals with healthy, functional respiratory systems should be upset by that; but they enjoy it because it‚Äôs one of the only times they can breathe clearly.
    At first I didn't think much of it and it wasn't worth catching. Then it didn't show up in Gen 5 without know how hidden grottos worked...then Gen 6 unless you knew how Mirage Islands work...and then nowhere to be see in Gen 7 or 8. Catching and raising one became one of the reasons I was excited for the Sinnoh remakes and Legends Arceus and I didn't regret it.
    I had one called Purbeauty
I never hear any Sharpedo love.
    I used Sharpedo on my team in my playthrough of ORAS. I quite liked him.
    Sw/sh ruined Sharpedo for me
    That goofy ass half shark will always be among my favorites. In fact, my first tattoo was a Sharpedo.
    Sharpedo is awesome, not top of my list but he‚Äôs up there.
    I love that chompy boi.
    I love Sharpedo
    He's got permanent love in my book.

I feel like Kabuto/Kabutops get completely forgotten. I love their design, but they just aren't exciting as far as stats I guess.
    Not really forgotten. Most people agree that it's the gen 1 fossil pokemon they like the most (im an aerodactyl fan myself)
    Yessssss
Seviper is mine. Dig the colors on it.
    Seviper is dope, but Zangoose is top tier in my eyes
        Always for some reason been a fan of Zangoose. Love that guy.
    The shiny one looks cool
    Seviper sorely needs a regional variant or mega evolution to boost its popularity. 

Im with u. I like Seviper over the other Snake pokemon
    The tailblade is fucking sick
    Have you seen its Shiny colors? My, my!
Starmie, wish it got more tlc.
    I got my ass whooped by Misty enough to respect tf out of Starmie
    Same here. It's certainly a well regarded Pok√©mon in competitive circles, or at least it was, but I almost never hear people saying its their outright favourite.
    Starmie is my favourite Pokemon of all time!
    Tlc?
    Starmie is pretty fast and has fantastic type coverage. If it‚Äôs ever an option to get him in the main quest I aim for it.
    Competitive Pok√©mon players spent every generation except SV knowing Starmie well.
Malamar. I played around with it in gen 6, actively used one on my team in gen 7, and from gen 8 onwards I swear by it in competitive.¬†

Remember when everyone thought they were hot shit for running Weakness Policy Steam Engine Coalossal and Surf Dragapult/Weavile? Hi. Topsy Turvy called, it wanted to tell you to SUCK IT. Same goes for Beat Up Justified pairings. ¬†It‚Äôs my dirtiest guilty pleasure, I still get the warm fuzzies thinking about it.

And then there‚Äôs the Contrary of it all. It‚Äôs unassuming, it crumbles to Fairy and Bug, and so people generally don‚Äôt pay it much heed. But suddenly I hit it with my own Fake Tears while it uses Superpower. Two turns of this, and honestly 85% of battles are done.¬† Add Tera Poison to the mix, and it‚Äôs a tremendous problem. Add a Flamigo to you party and most people ragequit. And they never see it coming.¬†

They presume it can‚Äôt do much damage, which isn‚Äôt untrue, but it also is *just* bulky enough to stack up boosts and unless they can erase your stats, they‚Äôre just praying for a crit each turn.

EDIT: [Here's my Malamar team thrashing a nice OU VGC team just today. ](https://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/gen9vgc2024regg-2108555711)Look at my beautiful squid. Didn't even need Flamigo.
    I cackled when I realized that Malamar's contrary reverses all of Ultra Necrozma's stat buffs when you fight him.
        Had one hour of sleep this night and was wondering since when does Magmar has contrary ffs
            Got topsy turvy in the brain
    Malamar is absolute BS cheese against the Sun/Moon island challenges

*oh actually you just raised my stats with your stupid ability

*haha I just used Topsy-Turvy and now you have 300% debuffs across the board stupid ass totem pokemon get rekt
    I take it you‚Äôre using one with Contrary?
    I love Malamar! One of my favourite designs, I have a plushie of it hanging in my car lol.
Emolga is my all time fave that I feel like no one remembers
    Oh I hated Emolga in Black and White lol. Had the worst time trying to beat Elesa when I played through those the first couple times lol
        lol funny thing is Elesa was really easy to beat with my own Emolga xD
Lanturn. I love this little guy, but he's kinda overlooked.
    I like Lanturn but I like Chinchou way more tbh
    Love Lanturn!
    Nuzlockers love Lanturn
    He deserves so much more love, one of my top favourites as well!
    I‚Äôm training up a secondary team on Violet and it has some of the ones I‚Äôve seen mentioned here like Lanturn and Tropius, plus a shiny Hypno
    Underrated typing too
I really like Cramorant.
The napkin on his neck is funny to me
From what I‚Äôve seen Comfey. The little thing was my favorite Pokemon from alola the moment I saw it in the trailer. I even have a shiny one in home
    I see it around the terrarium and still hardly even recognize it as a pokemon so yeah I would sgree
    It's releasing in Sleep tomorrow!
Magmorter. Love that brute. 

Also mainly cuz I never see it get talked about, Dragalge. Never played X and Y so seeing in in Scarlet I loved it.
    When X and Y came out I was shocked few people talked about Dragalgae even back then. It has such a cool design and a cool typing too
    Oh, I love Dragalge. Was so excited when I caught a shiny
    Dragalge is slept on for sure. Such a cool design.
    Noivern and dragalge are brothers in my mind, both 2 stage dragons with less than ideal stats that are annoying as hell to get in kalos

The only reason noivern is more loved is because it had a spotlight in the xy anime (not that i mind, noivern is my favorite pokemon)
    Skrelp is in an odd spot to catch in XY that requires back-tracking a ways after you get surf so it probably was pretty rarely used. It‚Äôs one of my favorite Pok√©mon though! And an easy top 5 dragons!

I think Oricorio line is very interesting but it's not that popular.
I really like Klefki. Granted, I think the people who hate on it most probably haven't actually played a Pok√©mon game in 20 years, but "it's just a keyring, it's so stupid, they're running out of ideas" etc.


¬†It's a mischievous little prankster who steals keys just to be a dick, and it jangles it's keys to scare away predators. That's so funny. He's like a tiny little guy shaking his keys at someone who wants to eat him. I love it.¬†


Plus, anything with prankster is basically useful by default, so I came to like Klefki a lot during Gen 6 competitive.¬†
    Yeah!! I love Klefki too!!
    Wasn't klefki used competitively quite a lot for a while? Definitely not forgotten about and many people love the design, even though it is divisive. 

Personally I love it
        a lot of Pok√©mon are used competitively that I still wouldn‚Äôt consider popular or having a ton of fans outside of that alone
    yeah klefki‚Äôs fucking awesome, cant believe people used it as an argument that they were running out of ideas when it‚Äôs one of the most creative ideas from gen 6

also it might be the only prankster mon that can actually usually tank a hit because steel/fairy is so op
    This right here, also if you loose your keys they will find them, who doesn‚Äôt want that in their life?
    >"it's just a keyring, it's so stupid, they're running out of ideas" etc.

This is why I appreciate Geodude. Good pokemon, amazing counter to that kind of whining. "Sentient key chain" isn't as basic as "rock with arms" and they know it.
    I didn‚Äôt know anything about klefki n now i‚Äôm strongly pro-klefki
    I always thought that argument was stupid when gen 1 has sludge with eyes, pollution with eyes, pokeball with eyes, and magnet with an eye (although, I personally love magnet with an eye).
Tyrantrum? Never heard much hype about him but he's THE reason I bought a 3DS and Pokemon Y
    I felt the same way with Amaura when Y came out. Cute lil aurora borealis friend

I should get an Aurorus and Tyrantrum for doubles and call them Chalmers and Skinner

"Aurora borealis, in this time of the day!?"
        Yeah amaura and tyrunt are by far my favorite fossils, though i love gen 5s fossils too, its hard to pick which one to choose
    I love Tyrantrum, I think he looks awesome
        Tyrantrum is, without a doubt, one of the strongest Pokemon I have and I can't wait to use him again in Z-A
    It was such a disrespect that they finally give us a T-Rex pokemon during the generation where they nerf him. He's everything 10-year-old me would've wanted.
    He‚Äôs my fav fossil ‚Äòmon.
        Same. In XY I always pick him.
Corsola! Any game Corsola is in the time at which you can finally capture it is always so LATE!
    Corsola is sooo cute
Marowak is dope
    Alolan Marowak was made for us
In this household we really love Lechonk. We got a plushie and he‚Äôs our unofficial mascot, even‚Ä¶ we are honestly kind of shocked that they didn‚Äôt become more popular.
    I love pigs so much. I was so excited to see a new pig for scarlet and violet!
        Right? I love the baby pigs especially :D like swinub
    i feel like everyone was talking about lechonk when the trailers came out tho? maybe got less attention after because s/v had a lot more eyecatching stuff
Furret ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
    We stan a normal type king
    Furret definitely isn‚Äôt an uncommon pick though.
    https://youtu.be/ih9zBLDr_ro?si=0L3Y8iNfz-H-4o1u
Sunflora
    Probably one of the most accurate ones mentioned here so far. Everyone keeps mentioning pretty well liked pokemon but I've never seen someone actively love Sunflora
Ludicolo
    My all time favorite pokemon, although he used to be used competitively quite a lot a long time ago so he did have his day in the sun at one point.

Arboliva is a very close second though
    Yes! Another ludicolo fan. One of my favs.
    Ludicolo is the best but others sleep on him
Rhyperior for me, a lot of people think it ruined what was decent in Rhydon.
    You're the first person I've seen who also considers Rhyperior a favorite!
    Rhypherior is excellent and an overall improvement. My only gripe is that you need to trade to evolve. Trading evolutions are a real stick in the mud to me
    We had a drawing done of our wedding outfits and made it Pokemon themed. Had to choose my fav boy to be in it with me.
        https://preview.redd.it/2t82re5avtvc1.jpeg?width=1489&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ef874610dfa70c84daabb0b5aa7bb5633c676ce7
            I like how it looks like he‚Äôs trying to squeeze into the frame on account of rhyperior is a wide boi.
            This is super cute lol
                Got it done as a surprise. Definitely happy with the results
    I like Rhyperior. From the time my eyes saw it in 2006.
    He‚Äôs a beast on a trick room team
    Rhyperior is pretty cool. I think it's a great designs. Rhydon isn't bad but the change from Rhyhorn to Rhydon is actually pretty minimal. And Rhyperior fixes that and looks pretty ferocious and intimidating.
    I also love Rhyperior and it is one of my favourites as well!
    I'd make Rhyperior my ace if pokemon exist in real life. Been in my imaginary team since 2007
    I think a simple color change and maybe a slight jaw-shape change would have made his popularity go way up, but also that whole trio hade wild, artificial, bulky-looking evolutions (meaning Magmortar and Electivire) and I guess too many people just didn‚Äôt appreciate that
    Rhyperior is great!
During Gen 4 there were way less Pokemon that looked "strong" than nowadays and I felt like Rhyperior was quite an impressive Pokemon. Also sort of rare due to it's evolution method.

One of my first rare Pokemon cards was a Rhyperior lv. X.

Also, it shoots stones from it's hands! Rock Wrecker is a creative move imo!

It has a special place for meüòÑ
Slowbro. It is not definitely forgotten due to being a gen 1 Pok√©mon but I cannot express how much I love it. It is so bizarre yet cool looking, and an excellent addition to your team in any game. It takes a bit to evolve but once it does it automatically becomes a staple in my runs.
    Slowbro didnt become one my my favorites until it got its Galarian form. And while it made me appreciate the old one more, I still prefer the poison variant
    Love the slowpoke line sm except the galarian ones
Skarmory, Tangela, Mawile and Mega Mawile
    https://preview.redd.it/492c71l11uvc1.jpeg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=254faa159704efe91df059e62c294af56a0a28bb

Fuck yeah! Mawile is the best!
Claydol!
    Hell yeah, brother
Medicham.
Araquanid. It was a crucial member on my team in USUM. It helped me single-handedly take down Ultra Necrozma.
    Such a cool design too
        Really cool design. Also matched by an amazing shiny form.
Togedemaru! He‚Äôs an absolute menace in battle.
Stufful/Bewear 

I just adore this lil (slash giant) pokemon so much + I adore red pandas irl.
    Yessss! I am a huge bewear fan. He‚Äôs such a doofy looking guy but they can be pretty good.
Aromatisse! I love her because it's such a campy combination of a french can can dancer, and a plague doctor combined with a perfume bottle. It's such a cool design and I really hope she gets a Fairy/Poison or Fairy/Grass mega in ZA
    Username checks out
Scovillain, he‚Äôs such a cool dude. Unfortunately I‚Äôve heard no one talk about him
    Fire/Grass type based of spicy peppers, what's not to love?
        Exactly
    Scovillain is fire! I've heard him being talked about because of his unique typing a lot, though.
        I just don‚Äôt keep up enough, I‚Äôm glad to hear he‚Äôs loved by others
    Scovillain is my favorite Paldea pokemon and that's saying something since I've wanted a Dolphin pokemon for decades! He just looks like the perfect henchman that laughs at its own jokes. Plus no pokemon wants to deal with a sun-boosted Solarbeam or Overheat
    I love him a lot but was floored it didn‚Äôt have another evo. He feels unfinished to me. But love him so much still
    Came here to say this!
Revavroom. Are you kidding? A hotrod style pokemon? üî•
    I love my gold murder mobile!
    They should make a Pokemon racing game with Revaroom as the customizable kart/engine.

Also, I love that they gave it Temper Flare so now it's really useable in most battles.
    Steel/Poison is such a fun type combo.
    My 5 year old daughter is obsessed with Disney princesses and revavroom is also her favorite. No clue why, it‚Äôs made her obsessed with poison types
    We still need it's mobile forms to be released for use
    When I looked through the new Gen 9 mons, I was pretty sceptical about it, but was¬†pleasantly surprise once I played Violet. Had an amazing one which became part of my main team and now I won‚Äôt stand for any Revavroom slander!
Dodrio, don't even know why, just think it's cool
Banette or Zubat
    hell yeah i LOVE banette!!!!! especially its mega forme üòª the more zippers, the merrier!
Cinccino!!!

So cute the way she'll whip your ass five times and then flip her scarf and walk away
Male Jellicent. I love the Pringles stache and it's just a floaty ghost buddy
    Their pokedex entries are so cool too
Greedent. Never had respect for the thing until I did a Nuzlocke of Sword. Literal tank that probably accounted for half of my box surviving.
Spinda
I like me a linoone, used to have a great ES linoone back in gen 6
    Idk why, but its pokedex entry stuck with me as a kid. It was one of the first ones I read as a child
Dhelmise.
I just like the pirate ship aesthetic with haunted seaweed being the real pokemon.
    i'm here to join the dhelmise gang. one of my favorite mons, I feel it gets ignored because it's so rare that a lot of people just don't know it's a thing.

Its rarity is justified, as a Dhelmise can only come into existence after a shipwreck. Due to whatever mysterious forces exist in the universe, the ship's wheel and anchor are tied up in seaweed and reborn as this mysterious pokemon. why does this happen? is it the "soul" of the dead ship returning as a Pokemon? like the ship of theseus, the rest of the ship is gone, yet the anchor and ship's wheel remain. they aren't even part of the pokemon - the pokemon is the mysterious force binding them together. but even with every other part of the ship destroyed and lost... the ship still lives on as long as there is a dhelmise down there chillin on the sea floor.  

at least that's how i see it. dhelmise is rad as fuck.
    Dhelmise is mine too!
Call them lazy and uninspired, sure, but i just love tirtouga and carracosta! I dont really know why, but i just do. Shame they get overshadowed by the dumpster fire that is archen and archeops‚Ä¶
Ursaring is my all time favorite Pokemon and I‚Äôve literally never met anyone who shares this with me.
Stantler. He is a deer
I really like Blissey. A big and kind egg mama who helps lost pokemons and people
    Is it not appreciated? I really live Blissey so much, but I think he/she is still more loved compared to Wormadam.
Maractus my beloved, my first ever shiny I stumbled upon in bw
    maractus is SUPER underrated! such a cutie :3
Magcargo.
    A snail brighter than the sun! I thought it was a Hoenn pokemon for a while xD
RATTATA PRIDE LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Zangoose, Ursaring, Tauros, Persian, Lopunny‚Ä¶maybe I‚Äôm just a sucker for normals, but I can‚Äôt wait til I can actually field this team in a game. Maybe add a Exploud for my 6th.
    Hard agree on the Tauros part
Spheal 

The Design ist flawless. The Name ist perfekt, the german Name "Seemops" (means "seapug") ist perfekt.

I Love him
    Omg they were right it actually looks like a sea pug üòÇ
mamoswine. its a beast and so good
    Huh? It's unpopular? I always try to add it to my team if I can.
    My bf worships Mamoswine! Too... much hahah
    I was terrified of Cynthia's Garchomp until I put a Mamoswine on my team and it pulled through. That same Mamoswine got me wins in Unova and Kalos and is now enjoying its retirement in Alola.

Rest well, Sasha.
I LOVE NINJASK
Mawile doesn't get enough attention. Not mega, just regular. My favorite.
Garbodor is dope!

My favourite is probably Excadrill, which I think is relatively popular? Other than that, I like the elemental monkeys a bunch.
Marshtomp is cuter than swampert
    But mudkip is cuter than marshtomp
I like Mismagius a lot. I don't how many others do though.
    One of my all time favourites
    Also one of my all time favorites
    mismagius my beloved....
Kecleon. If only its base stats were better. Still the mon!
I‚Äôve never heard of anyone loving Maractus, I love its OwO face and the funny sound it makes
my fav is wartortle, who def doesn‚Äôt see much love
definitely Shuckle! Don't fuckle with Shuckle
I haven't seen many people have Breloom as a favorite like me
    Shroomish is so great too. Love its grumpy face
    I love it, a kangaroo/mushroom/ankylosaurus thing that learns Stun spore and False swipe. Darn cute to boot. And grumpy little Shroomish is just as adorable. She's top of my team in Scarlet now.
    I‚Äôm with you, loved Breloom since it came out in gen 3. Packs a punch, interesting typing, cool design and awesome shiny too.
    Oh, I love Breloom!!!! One of my all-time favorites ‚ù§Ô∏è especially the shiny version!
    Fellow Breloom enjoyer spotted
    A lot of players who played comp. in gen 3 loved it, because it had access to Spore.
Bellsprout!
    Hell yeah! I've got a Bellsprout tattoo lol
Banette. I know it got a mega, but since then it's kinda been just popped in games as a filler. I love shuppet and banette so much ü•∫
    Same
Dracovish. He looks awesome and he hits like a Mack truck
Zebstrika. It just has such a cool design.
Octillery. Love that little thing
Bonsly
    Based and rocktreepilled
Zorua cute and Sly
Bruxish.
Wheezing!
Muk might be my favorite pokemon
Yanmega

Cool big prehistoric bug, fast and powerful, only setback is its typing, and no one puts it above the rest of Bugs
    I will never understand why it wasn't a bug/dragon type. Such a missed opportunity for one of the coolest bug pokemon designs
Slaking has always been one of my favs since I used it for the first time back in Ruby & Sapphire
I claim my stake on Lumineon! The butterfly fish is mine and mine alone!
    Thought I was the only member of the fancy fish fan club. Nice to see there are others.
Raichu has been my favourite forever
Definitely Calyrex
I unironically think that Cramorant and Flamigo are some of the best birds to come out of recent games
Darumaka, Helioptile, Accelgor, and Sandile
    Darumaka is my favourite!!
Slowbro doesn‚Äôt seem to have a big following but he‚Äôs my fav fav
I like how so many people here are going with incredibly popular picks that are obviously tons of people's favorites, rather than legitimately more obscure Pokemon.
Donphan is cool as hell.
Krabby/kingler. 

Before the physical/special split krabby was a poor water type due to its dismal special stat but I loved it still. And moves like vice grip really made it shine.
Magcargo. I will die on that hill.
I  like Raichu but probably because he's available in every game except yellow
I like trubbish but my brother absolutely calls it trash everytime he sees it on my team. Trubish is just so cute even if it's not for competitive.
(Plus mawile in gen 3, venonat, beedrill)
    Venonat and Beedrill are some of my favorites too, they're so cute. And I loved Mawile with its new Mega in ORAS, he slayed.
Doesn't Omastar have an entire culture dedicated to it? Anyway, mine is Starmie.
    I think you're referring to the "Praise Helix" memes that twitch plays Pokemon started.
        You're correct sir
Scovillain and phantump
Combusken anyone?
electrode  my beloved
Dunsparce: perfect since 2001
    Everyone wanted some ridiculous normal/dragon thing for Dunsparce.

Pokemon co knew what was needed to make the perfect Dunsparce, 

More Dunsparce.
I could maybe say Floatzel because everyone that I know seems to prefer Buizel, but I think the real answer here is Sawsbuck. I don't think most people remember it exists.
    Came here to find another Floatzel fan. It‚Äôs my No.1.
Cherrim
Mime Jr, don‚Äôt really see many people love it sadly
Quilladin is one of my favourites, he‚Äôs so cute. Yet everyone hates on him :(
Scrolled through every comment and didn't see my favorite so it must be unique but mine is Tapu Koko! I have a shiny plush too
Scrafty
Wartortle is mine!!! üê¢
Absol, Tropius, Girafarig, Stantler, Torterra, and Dragapult.
I'm a Heliolisk-lover and I'm yet to find anyone else that has them as their favourite.
 Vanilluxe
Dedenne! Everyone writes it off as just another pikaclone but fairy and electric are my two favorite types. I love that dude.
Clawitzer

Give me back Terrain Pulse, assholes. You had no right to show me the light then snatch it away the next generation.
My favorite has always been Vespiquen, partly because a queen bee pokemon is a neat concept, partly because she gets a whole host of unique moves (or at least did, RIP orders), and partly because bug types are so maligned in pokemon it makes me defensive of my lil guys.
Any other seel fans??
Steelix. Loved Onix as a kid from watching the anime, and the fact it has an even bigger harder hitting evolution is dope af. Also Aurorus slaps
Wailmer :3
Shiinotic was instantly my favorite alolan pokemon when I saw it. Love at first sight. Creepy, happy so cute. I love all the mushrooms mons but I feel like breloom has a bit more popularity because it's gen 3
Chandelure.  Goth decor as a pokemon.  Perfection.
I don't see much love for my boy, Steelix :(
Aron. Big fan of the shiny variant too. Been hunting one my whole life
Natu/Xatu. They're just cool guys
Sandshrew/slash.
Skarmory. It feels like everyone stopped liking it as soon as they saw corviknight.
Aromatise is a powerful little fairy in XY - I like getting a male and making him a fancy Klaus
Lumineon cuz it was my first shiny
Xatu, Ninetales, and Swellow are 3 I really like but don't see a whole Lotta mentions
    Ninetales? Have you been living under a rock? Everyone says Ninetales is majestic
    Swellow is mine too. And had a #1 Swellow fan in my feed yesterday. We're out here.
    Xatu was the mvp of my Sword monotype Psychic run
    Xatu is one of my favorite pokemon designs. It needs a regional form!
    Swellow is the best.
Purrloin! I find it's design adorable
Mudsdale/Bellibolt/Espathra/Slaking
Masquerain ü§ç
Garbodor and the monkey trio from Unova

Crabrawler and Crabominable
Lickitung. People don't seem to like him much sadly
Banette! One of if not thee best ghost type
Tyrantrum.
Sceptile . I've named him Capaldi because he looks like him (12th Doctor).He is my go to to fight the leaders and Giovanni. With close combat it gets rid of the shields quick üòÑ
Cubone (fairly rated), armaldo and eelektross
Well, my top 6 favs probably have a handful of pokemon that most wouldn't consider 

1. Meganium
2. Annihilape
3. Ariados
4. Wyrdeer
5. Galarian Weezing
6. Celebi
    Chikorita was my first pokemon ever. Meganuim holds a near and dear spot in my heart, plus it has a beautiful design. I love both weezing lines but something about galarian weezing is top notch. My fancy lil' guy with his mustache and top hats
    I am OBSESSED with Annihilape. He's what was missing with the other ghosts to me.
Mr. Mime.

I‚Äôm a sucker for a gimmick.
Serperior and Archaludon!!
Hitmonchan
Heracross, love me some bug Pokemon.
Probopass, because I really love Wikstrom as a character and have gotten attached to his whole team. I think the rest of his team is pretty well loved, though in real life compared to online, I'm one of the few people I know that loves the Aegislash line as much as I do. My friends used to poke fun at me for liking a sentient sword. 

And Stantler!! When we got Wyrdeer I was SO happy that Stantler was finally getting some love.
Corsola! I love its color and the smile. The shiny is one of the bests too <3
Lilligant for me. Normal, not Hisuian. I never see any love for her.
Falinks
stunky, just a super underrated mon i think people forget exists
Yveltal, sometimes i feel like im the only person in the fandom who likes him because i barely see any talk or artwork about him, i just love my little death birdie
ive been an og chingling fan but ive been seeing us multiply lately
Druddigon and Delphox.
Toxicroak! I love its silly face and move pool. I enjoy poison/fighting  (although steel is my favorite type) a lot and I often try to put it into every team I can.
Mismagius!!
https://preview.redd.it/3bnrn8x11uvc1.jpeg?width=475&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=773d6d68b424a113ad82ffe3c1a05f4d194696b2

Isn‚Äôt it just the cutest little guy?
Aurorus
Poliwrath
I really like Ferrothorn since I had one on my team in Pokemon X. Generally cool typing and I like keeping it slow and usually Gyroball. The 4x weakness to Fire is pretty spicy though.

Also, since I missed gen 5, I always associate it with Gen 6 and forget it's from the Gen before.
Butterfree probably ended up a bit more popular than a lot of other gen 1 mons for old hats due to being a very early 3rd stage evo, but I still feel like she's probably quite off-meta as a pick?  There's one of her in most generations after all.

Story time: I played Gold version first at the age of 8 , and somehow in my infinite child wisdom I decided to just full release Chikorita after struggling with Falkner. I guess even at that age I could tell that it was a trash mon, but maybe wasn't aware of the type charts, or the fact the restarting would have only taken like 1hr LOL. Only mon left in my party was a caterpie, and I just used that instead. We struggled our way through the early game together, and then she carried me through the rest near singlehandedly. A bit to funny to imagine Lance's big powerful dragons falling to the might of a literal butterfly but that's basically how it wentüòÇ A major roadblock was the Dark type elite 4 member I remember that being an "oh shit" moment for me as I discovered that psychic literally cannot hit this, and needed to get another member on my team for that one

Most people get to fondly remember a classic like Bulbasaur or Cyndaquil as their starter, I get to remember Caterpie. Wouldn't have it any other way
Wailord.
My all time favorite Pok√©mon is Xatu. Too bad he‚Äôs more of a niche pick. I always hear people say he‚Äôs under-appreciated but he‚Äôs never talked about. And since he‚Äôs not one of the more popular Pok√©mon, he never gets to participate in any of the unique gimmicks
Solosis
Flygon is one of mine. I liked the whole line since sapphire/coliseum. People trash on it being so weak and silly but I think it's fun and cool looking.
Seaking!!! They are just big fishy that deserve some love. Its mediocre stat total is the main concern. It gets lightning rod and mega horn. I want it to get a mega or another evolution into a more majestic koi like creature!!!
Steelix for sure!
I absolutely LOVE appletun. Grass/Dragon typing isn't too common, but I love the design so much, and the fact that he is so tiny and cute but hits like an absolute truck is so appealing to me. I've had him as my phone lock screen ever since SwSh came out.
Zubat. Just Zubat. I love him so much. My first caught pokemon ever my first shiny. I love the colors and everything about it.
Alakazam
I would say Mightyena, I have seen a few other Mightyena fans, but we seem to be quite rare. Fire Ninetales is also my favorite Pok√©mon but most folks seem to prefer the Alolan form, which I simply can't agree with
Scolipede, I love that pokemon so much
Mimikyu
Reuniclus for sure. Let me tell you I was incredibly surprised when Go came out with a sweatshirt for it
I have a couple:

- Raichu, especially Alolan Raichu (actually superior to Pikachu in many cases imo)
- Miraidon
- Hisuian Typhlosion
Trevenant for sure!
    I fw it hard, especially the shiny
Phanpy is a cutie and needs more attention
    Ctrl+F'd Phanpy to share an artwork my gf did for me back in high school of my starters, and my favorite. https://imgur.com/crdq24g and bonus, plush on my PC https://imgur.com/a/IWCC04z
Hypno or Krabby
Cubone.

It has the saddest story and I really feel emotionally attached to it since I also have some similar issues with my mother. But no one seems to care about him at all...
I feel that not enough people talk about Zorua. The best mischievous fox.
Hitmonlee has been my favorite Pok√©mon for years now I feel like it is under appreciated
Squawkabilly! It‚Äôs chatot with more personality, and everyone seems to hate it. I don‚Äôt doubt it‚Äôll be completely ignored going forward though, even garbodor got a G-max. Farewell, my colour babies.
Swablu or altaria. If it‚Äôs in the generation, it‚Äôs on my team lol!
Pelipper is up there for me. I love its design and moveset, but I feel like it's overshadowed by Gyarados as a water/ flying type
Venonat/Venomoth
Skiploom (shiny) i have it in a gym for 700+ days .
Swellow and Pidgeot have a special place in my heart despite being outclassed by other early birds these days but my Love of the early bird Pokemon comes from Ash always catching them when I was a kid so there is like a nostalgic connection with that.

I also love Buizel, diamond was my first Pokemon game so I always associate Buizel with that for some reason, I recently played a romhack of Pokemon X and must say Chestnaught shot up the rankings for me as well and he never gets any love but I loved using him.
Tangela. They‚Äôre kinda cute in an odd way, and it‚Äôs evolution is a swamp monster
 Chinchou is so cute
Barbaracle is one of my favorites in Kalos
I love Klefki! I think it's soo cute and adorable
Cofagrigus, Magnezone, Florgess, Wigglytuff, Mamoswine, and Swalot are the ones that come to mind atm.      

I caught accidentally a Gulpin with great IV's that massacred with sludge when playing 3rd gen once. Wonderful little boi.
Barbaracle
Croagunk, Toxicroak.

He‚Äôs so cute ü•π
Mismagius
Heatmor! 

I already really loved him previously, but he got firmly launched into first place after defending him from friends who thought he was ugly. 

He's a fire-breathing anteater with engines. That's sick af. I rest my case.
Chimchar, not infernape, Chimchar
For me it has to be Accelgor one of the coolest designs ever from Pokemon and it gets no love!
Tropius!
Bonsly/Sudowoodo :)
Numel! He's so derpy, and he was the first Pok√©mon card I ever had!
I'd say Salamence but it's not true. I actually know other people to whom it's their favourite too, which is strange as Pokedex is hella large
Vespiquen! I love bees, but in-game she's pretty bad. Still have one on my team tho lol
Chesnaught is my favorite fully evolved starter. He never gets the love he deserves.
Is Golduck an unusual favorite?
Swoobat. I think it is sooo cute and has a great color scheme and cry
Zubat
Ledyba! I'm *obsessed* w the lil dood, but no one else ever really mentions it, on or offline! Also Raboot. I love that lil rabbit SO MUCH!!
Rhyperior i just think it looks cool and is a huge improvement on Rhydon
Dusclops
Drifblim. While not my outright #1, my preferences do tend to lean towards tankier Pokemon that can recover for good sustain (Venusaur, Amoonguss, Reuniclus to name a few of my other faves), but then there is this boi. He can buff his SP/Def, recover, and has a mammoth health pool. People don't tend to like him for his weaknesses and lack of offence, and in competitive he's in the lowest tier - Which I kinda agree with in those contexts, but regardless he's still one of my favourites! Plus I also know people are creeped out by his tendency to steal children (From the Pokedex entry) lol
My favorite is Machamp. I‚Äôm sure there are dozens of us out there, but I haven‚Äôt met anyone else who makes the same claim. Let‚Äôs get MUSCULAR
Simisage
I think people would like garbodor if it‚Äôs arms were different
Seismitoad! I love his design/typing and always pick him up if he‚Äôs available.
Kingdra, its been my fave from the beginning
Big fan of Carbink. Just a floating jewel rabbit type thing. Cute as fuck, rock/fairy is a cool typing
Does ninjask count?
the lack of carracosta appreciation is unbelievable
fennekin

i chose fennekin because delphox is cool and i think greninja is overhyped and overrated
Beedrill. Totally get why it's less popular than Butterfree but I love it and think it's pretty badass.
mismagius, reuniclus and maractus are some of my favorites that i never see people talking about. i don't think they're disliked but no one seems to love them like i do
I like Minior. Its so unique for me T-T. And Lileep for sum reason hahaha i like lileep
Mareep! My favorite little sheep buddy, people seem surprised when I root for him lol I thought he‚Äôd have a huge fan base, but no, seems like it‚Äôs just me!
minior, I love the space ball, especially its shiny
I adore Dodrio
Definitely granbull, people hate it for being "ugly," but I love how unique its design is
I don‚Äôt particularly like (or dislike) snakes but for some reason I was really drawn to Seviper playing through Emerald as a kid.
Until Gen 9, I didn't really have a "favorite," but then I played scarlet and caught a phanpy (which then evolved into donphan). I used said donphan for the rest of my playthrough and subsequent dlc's because I buffed its stats a lot. So I now love donphan and wish it got more love.
There's not enough love for Galvantula. Good typing, good ability, great support.
Relicanth, love that prehistoric fishy
Baxcalibur. WHY DOES IT SEEM LIKE I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO LOVES THIS POKEMON!?!
I don't see too many Cradily fans.
Bellossom is one of my favorites. It gets outshined by so many others, including its original split to Vileplume,¬†and not many people seem to pay any mind to it or use it. I think it is cute and I love the little hula flower Pok√©mon.¬†
I like to think Reuniclus is an uncommon favourite to have, but I‚Äôm also not super active in the pokemon fandom
Jynx, Bruxish, Wishiwashi, Klawf. Huge favorites that I feel like nobody bats an eye at.
Cubone. I‚Äôve always had a soft spot for it.
Minior is genuinely so fun to use in battle
Lugia

Something about growing up on soulsilver and watching the Johto arc of the anime made me love it and it's duality as both a gentle giant and rage and fury incarnate. Slap it's self exiled nature and Takeshi Shudo's great upset with it and you get a Pokemon that will always have the #1 slot in my heart
Dragalge is my favourite dragon type and one of my favourite designs overall. I love the unique type combination (I like to pretend Naganadel doesn‚Äôt exist), and the idea of this huge looming leafy seadragon fuelled with draconic energy is so eerie but badass to me.

Plus I just love using it in competitive. I am a sucker for mons that are just nukes, and even without much investment Dragalge‚Äôs adaptability Draco meteor just hits like a truck.
Chatot! I didn't even use the chatter feature back in D/P/PL because I thought its original cry was adorable

I ironically have a Lv100 Chatot that I got from the Platinum in-game trade chilling in Legends: Arceus, whilst my starter from that same Platinum save is chilling in Violet now, which is ironically my favourite Pokemon (Empoleon). Had them both since 2009. Wild to think that was 15 years ago.

Chatot deserves more love üê¶üé∂
Ampharos, never left my side.
I loved Torkoal before it was cool üòé 

Also Seviper, Mightyena, and Aurorus need some love
woobat! i feel like its so easily forgotten but whats now to love about a blue fluffy ball with bat wings and a heart nose?
Koffing does it for me, personally I love that face, dude's always trippin'.
Maybe Wailord?  Mostly because I think the Pok√©dex size comparison is hilarious.  The thing makes actual legendaries look like ants in comparison.
Crobat is my favorite, which is really unfortunate for my Violet playthrough =(
I'm with you, OP; Omastar is in my top five.
Growing up my favorite Pokemon was Golem, to the point that my mom made me a golem costume for Halloween , but everyone thought I was a potato‚Ä¶
I went in not wanting to like Type:Null/Silvally but I love them so much
Most recently I really love Shaymin. Out of mythicals everyone goes for Jirachi, Celebi, mew or Victini. But Shaymin is an adorable spring hog ü•∞
not so sure but goodra ? I also find lickitungs design funny
magby!!
The Anime made me like Scyther. The Green Mantis look with the scythes on it's arms. Also the cry Scyther!
Bellsprout for that one scene with bellsprout dancing from the anime going
BELLSPROUT in a voice I cannot describe. Lopunny but not cuz I'm horny, I was challenged to do a solo mon run of ultra sun/moon with a normal type by a homie and the only one I could find was buneary. Return carried me most of the game and even though it was really fucking difficult I managed to succeed and now always want one on my team since then.
My top two I think are relatively unpopular, Drifblim and Pikipek
Farfetch'd
Female Nidoran and Nidorina
Noctowl and Crabonible! Loved Noctowl ever since he carried me through my first playthrough of Gold 

And Crabonible is a goofy lil' guy whose smile I will protect with my life
Spinda! His little drunken bear stumble is so cute! And they‚Äôre all unique!
Slakoth
Chespin.

He‚Äôs so silly and cute ü•∞
Drifblim.
I‚Äôm probably one of the only people who actually likes koffing
Despite all the memes, my ride or dies are 100% Lopunny and Cinderace. Love my bunnies!
Iron Moth, Iron Hands, Iron Crown, Iron Leaves. I know people love to shit on Future Paradoxes (except Valiant) because they are "lazy designs" that only made the base mons "robotic and metallic". But looking at their in-game animation, I loved their concept

* **Iron Moth** - Volcarona is a fan favorite, but I like Iron Moth as much as the bug that represents Sun (nah I don't like Slither Wing, Fight me). Moth represents sun as it is a Solar Panel. How cool is that? But wish it got Quiver Dance.
* **Iron Hands** - Massive improvement on Hariyama, whom I'm not a fan of. I like Makuhita, but Hariyama's face looks creepy to me. Iron Hands removes that creepiness, has way better color scheme and stats, and I love how its hands detach during combat. It has two of my favorite typings in Fighting and Electric.
* **Iron Crown and Leaves** - I don't care for Cobalion, and hate Virizion's designs. But their future paradoxes formes are again a massive improvement just by becoming metallic. I love how Iron Crown's horns extend and glow during attack, and same for Leave's blades.
* I love *Iron Bundle* too, but idk if its "seemingly no one else's favorite" - Again, "just by lazily making it metallic" its design is a massive improvement over Delibird. And even more massive improvement is that its stats that take it from one of the worst to one of the best Pokemon. It's a beautiful redepmtion arc, I love it.
* *Iron Valiant* is my favorite mon, but I think its a lot of people's favorite. Being a fusion forme of 2 already great designs, coupled with insane stats, unlimited movepool (give it Play Rough) and such a unique typing make it my favorite.
Tangela
My number one Pok√©mon is blissey
Jynx. Don‚Äôt need to say more.
Breloom! I just think it‚Äôs so cute
Nidoking
Ninetails love the way it looks. Elegant strong beautiful. I wish it were fire ghost or fire psychic tho
For design: Espurr and Meowstic are cute and get overlooked quite a lot

For battle usage: I do a fair number of draft leagues and I feel like I'm the only one that has ever taken Mismagius. Good stats, great coverage, nasty plot access, three type immunities, usually on the lower half of the point/tier spread, you'd think it'd be more popular.
In my last few plays of Ruby/Saph/Emer, Cacnea has been an auto pickup. Faint attack/Pin missile are so clutch as rocking out most monsters.
    >rocking out most monsters. 

You know, I've never thought of that, but they do give good rock vibes. Would go to a rock show with them.
Aahh I was going to say Carnivine as well ‚ù§Ô∏è
James and Cacnea are so cute!! Same with Jesse and Dustox :)
I love both of them and shiny Cacnea is my favorite color.
Cacturne was a mainstay on my OG *Ruby*/*Emerald* runs. He made the journey to my switch just a few weeks ago. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Speaking of James, my answer is Chimecho. My all time favorite Pok√©mon, and it‚Äôs all because of its derpy antics with James
carnivines neat looking but i just cant get behind such a useless pokemon gameplay wise
It's not my number 1 but I'm a certified Cacturn appreciator.
Honestly every pokemon Team Rocket used, I loved
They are cool/cute looking, plus Cacturne isn't bad in SV.
Although my only complaint is when you look under Cacturns hat and it's less creepy looking. XD
But it does look cute still
i was gonna say!  I love Cacnea and Shroomish in the Gen 3 anime
Oh it's just a big seal pfft how tough could it be

*dewgong used aurora beam

Me watching my health bar slowly inch to 0 ü§î
One if the most forgotten in Gen 1 for sure
    Seaking says hi
        At least Seaking has the whole  "FUCK YEAH SEAKING" meme
            What?
                [Sorry, my age is showing](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/fuck-yeah-seaking)

https://preview.redd.it/5ch3qn5ptuvc1.jpeg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=38ba5ae5d44ae43ff076500543bee59cb53d4df0
                    What is this lol
    It scarred 8 year old me for life. I don't know how many times I had to train to finally beat that Aurora Beam!! Love that 'mon though.
Dewgong is great! I've used it in a few playthroughs and while it's not the strongest pokemon, I think many would be surprised how useable it actually is. Also it just looks nice!
This is one of those ones that slipped under the radar in the main games but I now see as super strong because pokemon go. There‚Äôs a few. It‚Äôs funny because I picked up the main games a few months back and was going to rock a meta Pogo pick but realized it sucked. My idea of good pokemon is warped now.
I always loved Dewgong as a little kid whenever I saw it on TV! I had never played the game but I just saw this gorgeous white seal and was immediately sold!
That TV evolution to DewwwwGONGgonggong is forever etched into my brain.
Another Dewgong lover.  We do exist
i love that fella too, not my favorite but definitely close!
Dewgong!!! i love Dewgong!! one of my first cards was one. it was fake and you could definitely tell but man i love it to bits <33
Oddish has the face of a friend c:
Because oddish a cute
Gloom is my homie
Oddish is so good. The whole line is 10/10 honestly, *and* you get to choose from different evos!
I love the Oddish line
One of my first favorites because it was one of the first I learned how to draw!
people don't like Oddish??
THIS RIGHT HERE
Hope you watched the TCG Animations that have Oddish as main star
Oddish is so cool. What a funky little guy.
Oddish holds a place in my heart after it became my first legit shiny on Pok√©mon Emerald, after that I started trying to use Oddish more often and I fell in love with Vileplume and Bellosom
Oddish is amazing! Just look at that friendly little guy!
I have a class pet oddish. The kids fight to take him home on the weekends.
People don‚Äôt like Donphan? I‚Äôve always thought he was cool since seeing him for the first time in the movie. He was one of my first Pok√©mon ever when I played through Gold as a kid
Phanpy is one of my all time favorite pokemon, so I'm on board üëç
How do you feel about it two paradox forms out of nowhere? Always wanted to ask a Donphan fan about this.
    Don't care much for paradox forms (S/V in general, actually). But as a raging paleonerd, i fell in love with Great Tusk. Can't say the same for Iron Treads though.
    I like Donphan but I just don‚Äôt love Paradox forms. Really don‚Äôt care for either of his either. Idk‚Ä¶ these features are just seemingly the norm now, and I haven‚Äôt loved anything outside of Megas. I‚Äôm ready for a no-gimmick gen, but I‚Äôm not holding my breath.
        Both paradox forms are pretty good imo but donphan really needs an evolution to keep up with the power curve.

The paradox forms serve as a straight upgrade, but would work better as a split evolution. Especially in a game with phanphy as an early ground type encounter; going through most of the game with a normal phanphy/donphan only to ditch it near the end when the paradox is available feels bad in practice.
    Donphan was always one of my favorites. I kind of like the new forms. I have the past form on my scarlett team, don't care as much about the future paradox form
The worst part about donphan is that it's shiny should have been pink. The white is nice, but a baby pink elephant and a baby blue elephant just works.
In a playthrough it was absolutely a great speedy Ghost/Grass that surprisingly hit hard when I used it. Very good would recommend.

Speaking of Ghost types no one mentions a lot: Cofagrigus and Jellicent are awesome. Everyone mentions the other two Gen 5 Ghosts Chandelure and Golurk, but Imhotep and Pringles are great too.
    Jellicient superiority.
    I always name my male jellicents MUSTACHIO. I love my squishy spooky boy
BRAMBLEGHAST I FOUND ANOTHER PERSON WHO LOVES BRAMBLEGHAST YES YES YES I LOVE BRAMBLEGHAST!!!
I fucking love Brambleghast. SV had plenty of issues for sure, but one of the things it (and presumably SwSh but I didn't play those) got right is the overworld Pokemon. I avoided as many spoilers as possible, and walking through the desert and seeing Bramblin was amazing. Tumbling on its side like a real tumbleweed. It was obviously grass, but I didn't know what else, and was a little surprised when i tried to use tackle or something and found out it was ghost as well. Ghost is also my favorite type, so this was a sure lock in for my team. Those little moments of discovery, this one in particular, are what really made SV and I remember that way more than the 2 frame character animations (but if I dwell on those too long I might start to sour again).
I love Brambleghast, picked it up in Scarlet and love it since.
tropius deserves a buff
    First time I ever saw a Trpoius I thought it was gonna be strong AF. Like pseudo level cause of how cool its design is. I was mistaken.
        U might enjoy radical red. Idk if it's brilliant in it but it's definitely better lmao
    Tropius deserved an Alolan form with different fruit.
Loved that it was roaming the plains in Violet.
Tropius is the GOAT, it needs a buff so badly

When I was playing Blue Rescue Team as a kid, I managed to defeat Rayquaza thanks to a Tropius I recruited in one of the floors. Sacrificed themselves so I could land the final blow ü´°
Randbats on pokemon showdown made me despise itüíÄ Its a banger design tho
I posted Tropius without even checking to see if anyone else had said the same because my Dino Friend never gets any love.
It was a cool Pokemon who was also an elite HM slave. I have fond memories of it.
I wish you could watch one sawsuck change with the seasons
Finally, a fellow Sawsbuck enjoyer!
    I was so happy to find deerling in gen9
Love this mon
Sawsbuck's season forms is such a cool concept. Autumn is my favourite
I think it's very dumb how hard it is to get the different seasons outside of black/white. I remember getting my hands on some transferred ones in X/Y and mass breeding them. 

I get that the seasons mechanic is gone, but could they not replace it with anything? Randomize the wild encounters? Randomize eggs hatching? Set it based on route hatched on, or even the route you're fighting on? A held item, a consumable item, a random NPC, *anything*!
Shellos is adorable

I love the little sea slugs
Gastro boys a good
Every game they‚Äôre in I almost always have them on my team
I don't think this is a forgotten pokemon at all. It's very well liked
I‚Äôm using him for the first time on my current run of platinum and I LOVE him!
Fluffy spido boy a best
I love the fuzzy bug boy. Everyone only talks about how cute Joltik is, but Galvantula is a solid mon with great supporting moves.
    Indeed! And I just love his design and type combo
Big fan
    Elektross. Its only weakness is mold breaker!
Huge Galvantula fan. Only bug I like!
    Awesome mon. I'm a huge bug type enjoyer, but this one might just be my favorite
I respect it. Compound Eyes Thunder is not okay
That's a lot of pets in real life, mostly dogs, but there are some famous abominations of the feline variety that are still loved.
    As a dog owner and fan‚Ä¶ yeah, there‚Äôs dog breeds whose existence I pity.

Like, pugs actually enjoy being intubated while conscious. Animals with healthy, functional respiratory systems should be upset by that; but they enjoy it because it‚Äôs one of the only times they can breathe clearly.
At first I didn't think much of it and it wasn't worth catching. Then it didn't show up in Gen 5 without know how hidden grottos worked...then Gen 6 unless you knew how Mirage Islands work...and then nowhere to be see in Gen 7 or 8. Catching and raising one became one of the reasons I was excited for the Sinnoh remakes and Legends Arceus and I didn't regret it.
I had one called Purbeauty
I used Sharpedo on my team in my playthrough of ORAS. I quite liked him.
Sw/sh ruined Sharpedo for me
That goofy ass half shark will always be among my favorites. In fact, my first tattoo was a Sharpedo.
Sharpedo is awesome, not top of my list but he‚Äôs up there.
I love that chompy boi.
I love Sharpedo
He's got permanent love in my book.

https://preview.redd.it/wbw1fyq9tuvc1.jpeg?width=2252&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=85b1609ec953aee2855635ce77676d1d5fba5ca3
Not really forgotten. Most people agree that it's the gen 1 fossil pokemon they like the most (im an aerodactyl fan myself)
Yessssss
Seviper is dope, but Zangoose is top tier in my eyes
    Always for some reason been a fan of Zangoose. Love that guy.
The shiny one looks cool
Seviper sorely needs a regional variant or mega evolution to boost its popularity. 

Im with u. I like Seviper over the other Snake pokemon
The tailblade is fucking sick
Have you seen its Shiny colors? My, my!
I got my ass whooped by Misty enough to respect tf out of Starmie
Same here. It's certainly a well regarded Pok√©mon in competitive circles, or at least it was, but I almost never hear people saying its their outright favourite.
Starmie is my favourite Pokemon of all time!
Tlc?
Starmie is pretty fast and has fantastic type coverage. If it‚Äôs ever an option to get him in the main quest I aim for it.
Competitive Pok√©mon players spent every generation except SV knowing Starmie well.
I cackled when I realized that Malamar's contrary reverses all of Ultra Necrozma's stat buffs when you fight him.
    Had one hour of sleep this night and was wondering since when does Magmar has contrary ffs
        Got topsy turvy in the brain
Malamar is absolute BS cheese against the Sun/Moon island challenges

*oh actually you just raised my stats with your stupid ability

*haha I just used Topsy-Turvy and now you have 300% debuffs across the board stupid ass totem pokemon get rekt
I take it you‚Äôre using one with Contrary?
I love Malamar! One of my favourite designs, I have a plushie of it hanging in my car lol.
Oh I hated Emolga in Black and White lol. Had the worst time trying to beat Elesa when I played through those the first couple times lol
    lol funny thing is Elesa was really easy to beat with my own Emolga xD
I like Lanturn but I like Chinchou way more tbh
Love Lanturn!
Nuzlockers love Lanturn
He deserves so much more love, one of my top favourites as well!
I‚Äôm training up a secondary team on Violet and it has some of the ones I‚Äôve seen mentioned here like Lanturn and Tropius, plus a shiny Hypno
Underrated typing too
I see it around the terrarium and still hardly even recognize it as a pokemon so yeah I would sgree
It's releasing in Sleep tomorrow!
When X and Y came out I was shocked few people talked about Dragalgae even back then. It has such a cool design and a cool typing too
Oh, I love Dragalge. Was so excited when I caught a shiny
Dragalge is slept on for sure. Such a cool design.
Noivern and dragalge are brothers in my mind, both 2 stage dragons with less than ideal stats that are annoying as hell to get in kalos

The only reason noivern is more loved is because it had a spotlight in the xy anime (not that i mind, noivern is my favorite pokemon)
Skrelp is in an odd spot to catch in XY that requires back-tracking a ways after you get surf so it probably was pretty rarely used. It‚Äôs one of my favorite Pok√©mon though! And an easy top 5 dragons!
Yeah!! I love Klefki too!!
Wasn't klefki used competitively quite a lot for a while? Definitely not forgotten about and many people love the design, even though it is divisive. 

Personally I love it
    a lot of Pok√©mon are used competitively that I still wouldn‚Äôt consider popular or having a ton of fans outside of that alone
yeah klefki‚Äôs fucking awesome, cant believe people used it as an argument that they were running out of ideas when it‚Äôs one of the most creative ideas from gen 6

also it might be the only prankster mon that can actually usually tank a hit because steel/fairy is so op
This right here, also if you loose your keys they will find them, who doesn‚Äôt want that in their life?
>"it's just a keyring, it's so stupid, they're running out of ideas" etc.

This is why I appreciate Geodude. Good pokemon, amazing counter to that kind of whining. "Sentient key chain" isn't as basic as "rock with arms" and they know it.
I didn‚Äôt know anything about klefki n now i‚Äôm strongly pro-klefki
I always thought that argument was stupid when gen 1 has sludge with eyes, pollution with eyes, pokeball with eyes, and magnet with an eye (although, I personally love magnet with an eye).
I felt the same way with Amaura when Y came out. Cute lil aurora borealis friend

I should get an Aurorus and Tyrantrum for doubles and call them Chalmers and Skinner

"Aurora borealis, in this time of the day!?"
    Yeah amaura and tyrunt are by far my favorite fossils, though i love gen 5s fossils too, its hard to pick which one to choose
I love Tyrantrum, I think he looks awesome
    Tyrantrum is, without a doubt, one of the strongest Pokemon I have and I can't wait to use him again in Z-A
It was such a disrespect that they finally give us a T-Rex pokemon during the generation where they nerf him. He's everything 10-year-old me would've wanted.
He‚Äôs my fav fossil ‚Äòmon.
    Same. In XY I always pick him.
Corsola is sooo cute
Alolan Marowak was made for us
I love pigs so much. I was so excited to see a new pig for scarlet and violet!
    Right? I love the baby pigs especially :D like swinub
i feel like everyone was talking about lechonk when the trailers came out tho? maybe got less attention after because s/v had a lot more eyecatching stuff
We stan a normal type king
Furret definitely isn‚Äôt an uncommon pick though.
https://youtu.be/ih9zBLDr_ro?si=0L3Y8iNfz-H-4o1u
Probably one of the most accurate ones mentioned here so far. Everyone keeps mentioning pretty well liked pokemon but I've never seen someone actively love Sunflora
My all time favorite pokemon, although he used to be used competitively quite a lot a long time ago so he did have his day in the sun at one point.

Arboliva is a very close second though
Yes! Another ludicolo fan. One of my favs.
Ludicolo is the best but others sleep on him
You're the first person I've seen who also considers Rhyperior a favorite!
Rhypherior is excellent and an overall improvement. My only gripe is that you need to trade to evolve. Trading evolutions are a real stick in the mud to me
We had a drawing done of our wedding outfits and made it Pokemon themed. Had to choose my fav boy to be in it with me.
    https://preview.redd.it/2t82re5avtvc1.jpeg?width=1489&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ef874610dfa70c84daabb0b5aa7bb5633c676ce7
        I like how it looks like he‚Äôs trying to squeeze into the frame on account of rhyperior is a wide boi.
        This is super cute lol
            Got it done as a surprise. Definitely happy with the results
I like Rhyperior. From the time my eyes saw it in 2006.
He‚Äôs a beast on a trick room team
Rhyperior is pretty cool. I think it's a great designs. Rhydon isn't bad but the change from Rhyhorn to Rhydon is actually pretty minimal. And Rhyperior fixes that and looks pretty ferocious and intimidating.
I also love Rhyperior and it is one of my favourites as well!
I'd make Rhyperior my ace if pokemon exist in real life. Been in my imaginary team since 2007
I think a simple color change and maybe a slight jaw-shape change would have made his popularity go way up, but also that whole trio hade wild, artificial, bulky-looking evolutions (meaning Magmortar and Electivire) and I guess too many people just didn‚Äôt appreciate that
Rhyperior is great!
During Gen 4 there were way less Pokemon that looked "strong" than nowadays and I felt like Rhyperior was quite an impressive Pokemon. Also sort of rare due to it's evolution method.

One of my first rare Pokemon cards was a Rhyperior lv. X.

Also, it shoots stones from it's hands! Rock Wrecker is a creative move imo!

It has a special place for meüòÑ
Slowbro didnt become one my my favorites until it got its Galarian form. And while it made me appreciate the old one more, I still prefer the poison variant
Love the slowpoke line sm except the galarian ones
https://preview.redd.it/492c71l11uvc1.jpeg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=254faa159704efe91df059e62c294af56a0a28bb

Fuck yeah! Mawile is the best!
Hell yeah, brother
Such a cool design too
    Really cool design. Also matched by an amazing shiny form.
Yessss! I am a huge bewear fan. He‚Äôs such a doofy looking guy but they can be pretty good.
Username checks out
Fire/Grass type based of spicy peppers, what's not to love?
    Exactly
Scovillain is fire! I've heard him being talked about because of his unique typing a lot, though.
    I just don‚Äôt keep up enough, I‚Äôm glad to hear he‚Äôs loved by others
Scovillain is my favorite Paldea pokemon and that's saying something since I've wanted a Dolphin pokemon for decades! He just looks like the perfect henchman that laughs at its own jokes. Plus no pokemon wants to deal with a sun-boosted Solarbeam or Overheat
I love him a lot but was floored it didn‚Äôt have another evo. He feels unfinished to me. But love him so much still
Came here to say this!
I love my gold murder mobile!
They should make a Pokemon racing game with Revaroom as the customizable kart/engine.

Also, I love that they gave it Temper Flare so now it's really useable in most battles.
Steel/Poison is such a fun type combo.
My 5 year old daughter is obsessed with Disney princesses and revavroom is also her favorite. No clue why, it‚Äôs made her obsessed with poison types
We still need it's mobile forms to be released for use
When I looked through the new Gen 9 mons, I was pretty sceptical about it, but was¬†pleasantly surprise once I played Violet. Had an amazing one which became part of my main team and now I won‚Äôt stand for any Revavroom slander!
hell yeah i LOVE banette!!!!! especially its mega forme üòª the more zippers, the merrier!
Their pokedex entries are so cool too
Idk why, but its pokedex entry stuck with me as a kid. It was one of the first ones I read as a child
i'm here to join the dhelmise gang. one of my favorite mons, I feel it gets ignored because it's so rare that a lot of people just don't know it's a thing.

Its rarity is justified, as a Dhelmise can only come into existence after a shipwreck. Due to whatever mysterious forces exist in the universe, the ship's wheel and anchor are tied up in seaweed and reborn as this mysterious pokemon. why does this happen? is it the "soul" of the dead ship returning as a Pokemon? like the ship of theseus, the rest of the ship is gone, yet the anchor and ship's wheel remain. they aren't even part of the pokemon - the pokemon is the mysterious force binding them together. but even with every other part of the ship destroyed and lost... the ship still lives on as long as there is a dhelmise down there chillin on the sea floor.  

at least that's how i see it. dhelmise is rad as fuck.
Dhelmise is mine too!
Is it not appreciated? I really live Blissey so much, but I think he/she is still more loved compared to Wormadam.
maractus is SUPER underrated! such a cutie :3
A snail brighter than the sun! I thought it was a Hoenn pokemon for a while xD
Hard agree on the Tauros part
Omg they were right it actually looks like a sea pug üòÇ
Huh? It's unpopular? I always try to add it to my team if I can.
My bf worships Mamoswine! Too... much hahah
I was terrified of Cynthia's Garchomp until I put a Mamoswine on my team and it pulled through. That same Mamoswine got me wins in Unova and Kalos and is now enjoying its retirement in Alola.

Rest well, Sasha.
But mudkip is cuter than marshtomp
One of my all time favourites
Also one of my all time favorites
mismagius my beloved....
Shroomish is so great too. Love its grumpy face
I love it, a kangaroo/mushroom/ankylosaurus thing that learns Stun spore and False swipe. Darn cute to boot. And grumpy little Shroomish is just as adorable. She's top of my team in Scarlet now.
I‚Äôm with you, loved Breloom since it came out in gen 3. Packs a punch, interesting typing, cool design and awesome shiny too.
Oh, I love Breloom!!!! One of my all-time favorites ‚ù§Ô∏è especially the shiny version!
Fellow Breloom enjoyer spotted
A lot of players who played comp. in gen 3 loved it, because it had access to Spore.
Hell yeah! I've got a Bellsprout tattoo lol
Same
Based and rocktreepilled
I will never understand why it wasn't a bug/dragon type. Such a missed opportunity for one of the coolest bug pokemon designs
Thought I was the only member of the fancy fish fan club. Nice to see there are others.
Darumaka is my favourite!!
Venonat and Beedrill are some of my favorites too, they're so cute. And I loved Mawile with its new Mega in ORAS, he slayed.
I think you're referring to the "Praise Helix" memes that twitch plays Pokemon started.
    You're correct sir
Everyone wanted some ridiculous normal/dragon thing for Dunsparce.

Pokemon co knew what was needed to make the perfect Dunsparce, 

More Dunsparce.
Came here to find another Floatzel fan. It‚Äôs my No.1.
Ninetales? Have you been living under a rock? Everyone says Ninetales is majestic
Swellow is mine too. And had a #1 Swellow fan in my feed yesterday. We're out here.
Xatu was the mvp of my Sword monotype Psychic run
Xatu is one of my favorite pokemon designs. It needs a regional form!
Swellow is the best.
Chikorita was my first pokemon ever. Meganuim holds a near and dear spot in my heart, plus it has a beautiful design. I love both weezing lines but something about galarian weezing is top notch. My fancy lil' guy with his mustache and top hats
I am OBSESSED with Annihilape. He's what was missing with the other ghosts to me.
I fw it hard, especially the shiny
Ctrl+F'd Phanpy to share an artwork my gf did for me back in high school of my starters, and my favorite. https://imgur.com/crdq24g and bonus, plush on my PC https://imgur.com/a/IWCC04z
>rocking out most monsters. 

You know, I've never thought of that, but they do give good rock vibes. Would go to a rock show with them.

It scarred 8 year old me for life. I don't know how many times I had to train to finally beat that Aurora Beam!! Love that 'mon though.
