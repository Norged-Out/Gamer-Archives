[[if tboi only had 5 playable characters (not counting tainted), who would you choose to remain playable here are my picks]]





Isaac, blue baby, lost, forgotten, and azazel

Reason for this is because all of them tie directly to the story In some way. Blue baby, lost, and forgotten are all of Isaac's burdens as seen in the beast ending, and azazel is what Isaac fears he is.
    Rip keeper I guess
        Game needs an easy mode
        I guess because of him being from a mode aside from the main storyline. I could take him instead of Azazel, but that brimstone too unique for me to get rid of)
        I rather play lost than keeper that holy mantle is 1 free hit every room
    Only correct answer right here
That's not forgotten, that is "Forget or ur rotten" ![img](emote|t5_2sxpk|17739)
Cain is always on the list because pills
    Would Cain be the supreme baller, as he takes all pills, or a coward by having all negative effects eliminated from him?
        He's taking drugs either way
            Yes, but its like comparing a stoner(real baller ![img](emote|t5_2sxpk|17743)) to a strongman that tales steroids(Ca√≠n![img](emote|t5_2sxpk|17738))
Plot twist, you don‚Äôt have access to other characters unlocks either

so enjoy life without Damocles and Rock Bottom J&E deniers

Isaac, The Lost, Bethany, Azazel, and Eden. Keeping Isaac because duh, gotta keep at least one challenge character in, the easy character is good to have, Eden is a must imo, and Bethany is my favorite character.
    bethany enjoyers
    Isaac isn‚Äôt hard imo üòÖ
        I can see how you thought that's what I meant lol, Isaac isn't hard. I was referring to the lost with that.
Isaac, Maggy, Cain, Judas, Eve.

Less because of a gameplay reason, and more because those are the "OG" characters to me. I know Blue Baby would be more accurate than Eve, but I'm biased. I started playing TBOI because the original flash version was a dollar because it was on sale back in October. I still don't have Wrath of the Lamb, but apart from Judas, I had all of these characters unlocked. I actually rushed to unlock Eve first because I thought she looked cool lol. I suck at flash Isaac and never got past depths, but the 12 hours I have in it convinced me into getting Rebirth and its DLCs 2023 Xmas which was one of the best choices of my life.

I'd still be cutting out my favorite characters (Azazel, Lilith, and a good few of the Tainteds) but these are the ones I most associate with TBOI.
Issac, Cain, Lillith, Eden, Azazel
Isaac, Magdalene, Azazel, Eden, Bethany
Isaac, Judas, Eden, Lost, Azazel
Isaac, Eden, Forgor, Azazel, Lost
Same as you but, swap keeper with azazel
Ok, so the three who kinda have to stay:

Isaac, Eden, The Lost

Isaac is self explanatory, main character

Eden provides the variety needed when you only have 5 characters

The Lost is the only non tainted character without health, I feel like that trait is too important to give up

Now, the final two: Maggy and The Forgotten 

Maggy because she has the unique trait of being hella tanky and having fun game breaks

The Forgotten because of how vastly different his gameplay is and how massive breath of fresh air he would be to play
    I still feel like the keeper is better over maggy. Issac and eden could become tanky in similar ways to maggy while the kepper brings a unique play style to the game just like the forgotten
        keeper is probably my favorite character but I thought maggy was a better choice because of her floor 1 rigs, while keepers most fun while your slowly unlocking stuff to make him stronger
            Fair enough
Isaac, lost, J&E, Keeper and bethany. The other ones are simply Isaac but with slightly different items, except for forgotten and blue baby.
    Personally, I think Jacob and Hitbox shouldn't even be in the game now. Replace it with Azazel or Lilith and I would 100% agree
    Based hit box and hit box enjoyer
Cain,Forgor,Eden,Beth and Lost.
Isaac, Bethany, Jacob & Esau, Eden, Azazel
Isaac, Forgotten, Lost, Eden, Azazel
Jacob, Esau, Stumpford, Frank, and Jeff ![img](emote|t5_2sxpk|8906)
    Jeff is stupid and dumb
Isaac, blue baby, eve, cain and hitbox & hitbox
    I was gonna put hitbox & hitbox in my list, but I didn‚Äôt out of spite
Isaac, lost, azazel, Judas and Samson. Pretty vanilla, I guess.
Lilith, Cain, Bethany, Lost and maybe Azazel, in that order.
Eve, Eve, Eve, Eve and Eve
Isaac, Cain, Judas, Blue Baby and probably Forgotten, although I really like Lazarus (not tainted), Lilith and Eden. The logical pick would probably be the newbie friendly Azazel, though.
Tainted Cain regular blue baby normal blue baby tainted lost and d6 less Issac and also since blue baby‚Äôs not on that list no d6 for you
    Someone didn‚Äôt read the title lol
[deleted]
    They specifically said non tainted ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Cain, Samson, Isaac, Bethany, Azazel
Isaac, ???, Keeper, Forgotten, and Lost are all meant to be Isaac during the stages of decomposition, and thus being the most lore relevant so it'd probably be those.                                                                                 If it were up to me tho, I'd choose Isaac, Azazel, Lost, Forgotten, and J+E
Issac, azazal, forgotten, lost, keeper
Isaac, bethany, forgotten, cain, t cain
Based normal keeper
I have a friend that doesn't know what other characters do because he only plays as azazel so he would choose azazel 5 times
eve cain maggy judas and ???
Issac, Lilith, The Forgotten, Azazel, and The Keeper
Isaac, Judas, Cain, Eve, and Maggie, oh, and ??? as a secret 6th character for beating the game a bunch
Keeper appolyon forgotten azazel j&e 

(I have a mod for j&e that makes them playable)
Rip Lazarus bro won‚Äôt appear on anyone‚Äôs list
I agree with your picks, but sub keeper for azazel, cause he was my main character for the first 300 hours, and I haven‚Äôt unlocked keeper yet (I have everyone else, including tainted versions, but only have 600 gold in the greed donation machine)
Lilith, Keeper, Judas, Bethany, Cain.
Eden, lost, forgor, keeper and azazel
I'll ignore the story-line, and tell my picks:
Azazel
Tainted Lost
Eye sack
Tainted Azazel
And, last but not the least, Tainted Eden.
Isaac, lost, forgotten, azazel and Bethany
Isaac, Judas, The Lost, Maggy & Eve

I like Isaac
Judas is a fun character who I love to play as ever since binding of Isaac

The lost with mantle is fun. Without I‚Äôll probably go cain

Maggy since speedrunning = fun

And eve because like Judas, she is fun to play as. She also has the unique ability of trying to keep your red hearts non-existing (for people without razer blade)
I'd pick the same ones tbh
all the dogma cutscene isaacs.
Isaac, the lost, blue baby and the forgotten.
Isaac ??? Azazel forgotten and eden
regular keeper sucks donkey balls
Magdalene is the most fun non-tainted for me, so definitely her.

Other than than probably Lost, Isaac, Lilith and Blue Baby.
Isaac , obviously
Maggy as an "easy character"
Lost as a challenge character
Forgotten for a different play style
And Azazel cause he's fun
Where's Judas ? That glass cannon character is my favorite
Isaac, Azazel, Keeper, Forgotten and Eden
Isaac, Eden, Lost, Keeper, Jacob and Esau

Isaac cuz you gotta man, if he's not in the game than whose binding we playing anymore.

Eden because, as painful as it was to choose him over so many others, you need the variety he brings.

The Lost because his Gimmick is fun and hard.

The Keeper because his Gimmick is so unique.

Jacob and Esau because I rly like them and find them vry fun :)


Also choosing only 5 sucks op wtf dude you just wanna bring us pain and suffering :(:(:(
Isaac maggy Cain Judas eve (Samson does not exist)
car
Isaac, Judas, Eden, Lost, bethany :)
Isaac, Keeper, The Forgotten, Azazel and Blue Baby
Isaac, Maggy, Eden, Azazel, Keeper
Why the hell does the forgotten have a gun?

Isaac,lost,forgotten,jacob and esau and eden since the each give a unique way to play the game
???, Lazarus, J&E, Apollyon, and Keeper. They‚Äôre not my favorites but ik it would piss a lot of people off
forgotten, lost, isaac, forgotten, and forgotten
Original 5 characters are: Isaac cain magdalene eve and blue baby but i wouldn't choose them. My picks are: isaac, cain, lost, forgotten and apollyon
Isaac (of course), Azazel, Lilith (need that C-section), Eve (why not), and the non-binary character to balance things out: ghost (The Lost).
Forgotten, Isaac, Cain, Apollyon and Eve.
Fuck Eden why do people love this character so much
Isaac, Lost, Azazel, Forgotten and brothers(I don't like them but their mechanic is interesting)
Isaac, Cain, the lost, forgotten , keepeer
isaac, maggy, cain, judas, azazel

&#x200B;

gotta keep the core 3, judas is basically an addon for the main 3, and azazel for easy mode
Issac, the lost, the forgotten, Eden, azazel
Lost or eden
Rip keeper I guess
    Game needs an easy mode
    I guess because of him being from a mode aside from the main storyline. I could take him instead of Azazel, but that brimstone too unique for me to get rid of)
    I rather play lost than keeper that holy mantle is 1 free hit every room
Only correct answer right here
Would Cain be the supreme baller, as he takes all pills, or a coward by having all negative effects eliminated from him?
    He's taking drugs either way
        Yes, but its like comparing a stoner(real baller ![img](emote|t5_2sxpk|17743)) to a strongman that tales steroids(Ca√≠n![img](emote|t5_2sxpk|17738))
