[[How the FUCK do you beat Mother]]


I've gotten to Mother several times now with really good runs, but every single time that I get close to killing her I just get absolutely fucking slammed, and the worst part is just how *long* it takes to get to her every time.

&#x200B;

Update: Finally beat mother, thanks for all the advice!


Getting to mother with enough health is the hard part. Most of the time I have beat her I had some sort of rechargeable health. 4.5 volt is your friend. That item has won tons of runs for me. Usually you’ll find an item it will work with. Other than that you just have to get lucky. I almost always focus on getting angel deals. I play on the switch and I restart a ton until I get a decent starting item. The only practice I get with defeating mother is actually getting to her so I can’t command console summoning her to fight and learn. Hope that helps.
    4.5 volt + Book of Shadows is sooo good. 

To me getting to Mother herself with enough health wasn't the hardest part per se, it's more so surviving Dross and Mausoleum and of course not forgetting to pick up both knife pieces. Weirdly enough the Corpse is one of the easiest levels in my opinion (the bosses are still hard).
        Dross is not too hard for me. Ashpit on the other hand is bullshit. The bosses there are even more bullshit
            For me i almost always go to dross/downpour just because the patterns aren't super hard and feel fair 90% (exception was me getting keeper unlocks like wooden nickel/a coin) of the time but i'll only go to mines/mausoleum if i'm going to mother just because of how much harder they are compared to caves/depths
                Yeah for sure. Imo, mines is at least mostly fair. Ashpit bosses like clutch, singe, and Gideon can go off themselves

Meanwhile I still have absolutely no idea what visage does besides some chains, spinning? Brimstone, random bullets, more chains, energy balls, things, attack. Seriously every time I thought I know what to expect, he pulls off a new attack

Mausoleum is where I become paranoid in every single room
                    Only reasonable ashpit boss is shell
                        Fr. Even pile is somewhat bs, just not as bs as others
                            With base keeper or maggy speed i'd say he's unfair
                                Tru. At this point I might even prefer a long boss room than a small one, cuz at least there’s a certainty of which boss I’ll face
            I meant in the way that they're much harder than regular Basement. Also my current laptop runs Dross in like 15 fps lol.
    The absolute worst on switch is the lag when she spams the bullet hell move. And the lag in the mirror dimension
Most of her attacks are avoidable with practice, but the truthful answer is to beat her you gotta die to her a bunch. And don't get hit by scripted attacks like her dash or turdstone beam

A big HP pool helps, and of course there's always Gnawed Leaf+ Orbital
    I always get hit by the dash![img](emote|t5_2sxpk|17741)
        The one where she charges left and right once each?
My best tip is to plant bombs when she does it, they slow her down immensely, so you can dodge even when you react a little too late and deal some damage
        You littersly see Left or right side shake before she charge everything telegraphed
            Yea, there’s a visual cue. Very simple stuff
its a tough but fair boss with a shitton to learn.all you can do is keep trying and learn her attacks. some people opt to use the command console to practice her. whether thats too cheaty to you or not is entirely up to you, its a singleplayer game. personally i dont think its that cheaty
    Cries in console
        this was such an issue that I spent an extra 50 euros to get it on pc after I bought it on switch
            External mod desc was what made me double dip.  So helpful.
        Maybe not exactly the same, but save scumming is a good console alternative. Save to USB right before dropping down the hole, load from the save if you die.
    Yeah this one took me the longest to pick up on how to fight. Lots of seemingly unfair attacks that are damn hard to dodge
watch some fights of her on youtube and watch the projectile patterns.. then after 1st phase get out of the middle.
Delirium is a lot worse, Mother is easy
Quite literally skill issue. You can dodge everything in that fight and her patterns are straightforward.
Quick, precise, small movements. Her attacks are generally tightly spaced so moving too much makes it harder to get into a decent safe spot. Also, her harder attacks (ping pong and spinning head) come down to doing quick circles or moving back and forth in the same spot until they end. Throw a bomb down on her charge attack as well.
Era walk, book of shadows and brimstone :)


Edit: don't forget car battery!
    4.5V*
With skill obviously

And you can't go wrong with lots of HP + being patient with her patterns
Bombs are your friend against her. And keep anything that gives a shield. With high damage and lots of bombs you can win before your algiz runs out.
She's completely fair. The hardest part is getting to her. I hate Mausoleum/Gehenna.
Make a lot of damage to her, while at the same time take none yourself.
Have no skill issue![img](emote|t5_2sxpk|8906)
I abused Glowing Hourglass as Bethany with like 20 soul charges stored. Slow is the best status in the game, op as fuck
This video helped me a lot https://youtu.be/J9wyHG2T294?si=zMxHMSbFbp0ajHoE
lol, I thought this was a Mother subreddit for a second and got so confused
I think you have to prioritize dodging heavily, like 95% dodging and 5% shooting. You just hold towards her general direction and make sure you aren’t getting hit
A lot of the later bosses are very much based around being positionally aware. Usually the sides of a room are pretty safe, mom breaks that with the doors she can attack from. Stay moving, stick to the center and corners of the room. Sometimes it'll be safer to stop attacking and focus entirely on repositioning.
Here's my mother guide from the top of my head:

Fistula attack: keep calm and go above it if needed, also try to stay at least a bit off the ground so the tears don't hit you, they go in a triangle pattern so just stay inside the area. Despite how overwhelming it may seem it's decently slow, so try to not get scared by it.
Knife attack: go 5 tiles under Mom's hand the opposite of where her knife lands, if done correctly the tears from the knife should go above and under you since they also go in a triangular pattern. Now look at where the middle tears are coming from and go down and up to avoid it, slow movements are key. 
Note: sometimes you can go to the very bottom and go up and down instead of vice versa, though it's a little inconsistent so I recommend the first method.
The stampede: I don't know what this attack is called but it's where she summons a bunch of Isaacs to walk up. I suggest picking either left or right and making sure to kill any Isaacs that go in your lane, so just shoot down basically. You can shoot down without much thought so just look up at if mother is throwing an isaac at you or not, if she is you can just move up and down accordingly until the attack is over, so stay in your lane.
Maggot attack: when there's a little lump appearing on mother's hand, she's doing the maggot attack, where she'll fire off cursed eye tears and they'll home in on you. Though, they're decently slow, so you can go to the bottom left or right respectively until you can't anymore, then go up and the opposite direction. This should make the tears leave the screen with only 1-2 still left, which you can evade by going down with the extra space.
Maggot firing attack: when she raises her fist I suggest moving as far away as possible from her hand, and then dodging the red tears, they go in simple straight patterns so it should be easy to evade. The hard part comes from the maggots she spawns, they'll crowd the screen so definitely kill them fast and prioritize them first and foremost, since if you don't they'll make her next attacks nigh-impossible to dodge.
Ok, done with the first phase I think. Now the second.
Swallowing attack: run around mother in a circle until she gulps, then go into a corner, the corners make the fistula thing a LOT easier to evade. Now go to the underside of the arena where there's more space and dodge. Do note that the tears CAN bounce off of mother, so sometimes you'll have to look out for that but 9 times out of ten mother will actually block the tears.
Spin attack: just go left and right when a tear flies near, if you're in a bad spot like a corner then go up and down.
Up and down rush: when she jumps up, she'll go up and down in your general location, she telegraphs where she's going by doing a little particle affect. (She always goes above) go left and right depending on which side she's on (note: you can place a bomb in her path, which will stop her allowing for extra damage) once she's gone on both sides go to the bottom of the arena, she'll go in the middle and her projectiles will never hit you.
Line attack: go in the middle of the lines, do note that Isaac's hitbox is smaller than you think, same with tears. So small movements are key in this attack, same with many of mother's attacks! So I suggest going in the openings of the tears, though the tears do fall quite fast so sometimes you can just squeeze your way through but it's risky. 
Welp, that's all, hope this helps.
Whos gonna tell him😞
i have a -70 winstreak finally did it today went mental
It's the easiest of the superbosses with normal tears honestly. Megasatan is easier only if you've completely broken the run.
    You get a lot less Items for mother though, both the chest and darkroom are at least 4 Items and can make you so much more powerfull

Also Mega Satan is really not that hard, I mostly get hit when he spawns four Sins at once, because it's just utter chaos, but the bullet hell segments are (expect for like the silver Z one) really dodgeable if you know them, especially the ones in phase 2

In Antibirth you got four Items right before fighting mother, no clue why Ed changed that
        The silver ones are don't move when the tears intersect in their zigzag and move when they make a brief stop to reposition
Get lucky
my idea is grinding for a gnawed leaf and orbital combo, ill be its basic as fuck BUT nearly guaranteed win if u can get there :)
    Lmao and just Repeat that for every character?
        yeah ig it can kill delirium it just takes a while depending on the orbital
Magdalene with birthright, the wafer and a loooooooot of health ups
The Bible one shots her if you have it
    This is repentance mother, not her foot or heart. You can't kill her with the bible
        Oh snap, get good then I guess. Good luck and godspeed
Lay and pray. By far the worst boss of the game
    Totally disagree.  With practice, patterns can be learned.  Just takes time.  There are other bosses where that is not the case.
        Only one. Every other boss is much fairer
            The thing is, mother is 100% fair.  It takes time, but once learned is no more difficult than any other boss.  I don't think you could say any boss is more fair than mother.  Mother is harder, but fair.
                Every boss but maybe  maybe, delirium is meow fair.
            I know you mean delirium,

but Mega Stan’s 4 sins wave is actually quite unfair if your items are garbage

Mother’s attacks are fair
                And mother impossible if you don't have a lt least a defensive item
                    No it’s possible. You just need to practice. Her attacks are set
        Who is the worst boss in your opinion?
            Probably Delirium.  You can take unavoidable damage in that fight.  All damage against mother is fair.
                Besides the damn fistula attack otherwise it’s probably my second favorite boss after hush, it’s just a bit of a slog to get there with sucky characters.
                    Tbf, even the fistula attack is probably completely avoidable with practice
                        I’m sure but if I’m dying to mother it’s gonna be on the first phase
                Very true.
    This is one of the giga bosses in the game with no bs lol
        She is the second end game boss with most bs. Way more than mega Satan, more than hush, way more than The beast
            Mega satan and the beast are extremely easy bosses, especially mega satan. Hush and mother are the best bosses in the game imo, no bullshit, skill required, not impossible but neither too easy. The cum boss is terrible and should be reworked
            All I hear from you is a massive skill issue tbh
                Maybe.
I'm probsbly not good enough to beat Mother with normal character, but I've beaten delirium with the lost so it seems mother is harder which is my point
            Name one BS phase
                The vertical and horizontal tearlones have a phase when you can't see the next shot path.

The rotating phase leaves you no opening if it happens to start when you are in the wrong corner
                    You can see it, it’s just overlaid on top of the previous shot pattern. 

I’ll give you the rotating one, but that can be avoided by staying out of corners during phase changes
            If you have no items, mega Stan’s 4 sins wave is pretty bs. 

If your speed is low like Magdalene, it’s impossible to dodge dogma’s spinning dash attack. Also Ultra Death’s skull attack is bs

Mother’s attacks can be learned and she can be beaten even with no items
    Not even close.
    Mother has fixed patterns that you just have to know and it is not that bad i really love mother as a boss tbh compared to the cunt that is delirium for example
        She has fixed BS patterns
            Nah man just like hush after you get to know the pattern it is not really too hard anymore
    Until she outright telefrags or bombards you with tears it's fine, compared to other endgame baddies.
        "at least she is better than delirium" isn't a huge flex
            Idk... I have beaten Delirium multiple times, I've only beat Mother once. It may be because Delirium is a 2x2 space and Mother is a 2x1 room.
                Me too but it's too much of a strong opinion to state to somebody arguing with me
        Mother can't telefrag?
            I think he means “Mother can’t telegraph or bombards with tears (unlike a certain cum boss)”
            Every attack she can throw at you is telegraphed, to the point you can even tell which attack it is, think that makes it more fair.
● A good thing to try and invest in is gaining some speed in the earlier floors, when you do make it to Mom just keep an eye on the shadows, avoiding her big ass leg from damaging and blocking the screen is a plus. 

● Try not to hug the walls, she spawns annoying critters and getting trapped between that and the little Rock formations can take you from full health to few hearts in seconds. 

● Lastly what helped me get used to fighting Mom was doing challenge rooms, honestly the little rush of waves is a good mini version of fighting Mom and the such for future floors. 
But you got this man 👍 little practice and remembering a few good items gets you to further floors and cooler gameplays. 

Edit: also you could just use The Bible if you get the hold of it, it let's you fly for the room and also insta kills Mom and her heart (just don't use it on Satan as funny as it may sound) 
Safe basement dwelling
    I think OP talks about Mother, not Mom ?
    OP is referring to Mother, the last boss of the alt path
[deleted]
    Mother, not mom.
I tend to hover around one of the doors and keep moving and just focus the one door.

Edit: lol why all the downvotes. It's literally a strategy that works.
    Cuz that’s not “Mother,” that’s “Mom’s Foot.”

If you don’t know “Mother” yet, you should keep on playing. You will find out soon (hopefully)
    In flash there was a spot right beneath the left door where the hand would trigger but not hit you, I had to relearn the Mom fight when Rebirth came out because I would only ever cheese her back then (Monstro 2's brimstone had the same, the move would trigger, but miss you by a hair)
I mean best thing you can do is pick your moments, in some attacks like the knife or spin2win its just best to focus only on dodging, come phase 2 just make sure to keep your distance and pay attention to her bouncing about.
Some of her attacks can be really hard to dodge due to their randomness. I find the fight is much easier if you have some defensive tools rather then straight up offense. Book of shadows, wafer, even gnawed leaf can be a life saver.

Try to save all your stuff for the second phase of the boss as she has more difficult attacks and is more mobile.
I felt the same way about the beast fight before I was comfortable with it. Just keep getting down there and practicing her fight. There's a shit ton to remember but once you get the patterns down it gets much easier.
Shoot and/or hit her until she dies
I have died from her a minute ago lol
cry
There’s a YouTube video I watched where this guy went over all of her different attacks and how to avoid them and I haven’t failed her since watching it, it was very informative, if you literally go on YouTube and type in isaac mother fight tutorial it will go over everything :)
Like any boss, it just comes to learning her attacks/patterns and having a strong build. I wouldn't say she's one of the bosses that requires a unique strategy (BOI has very few of those imo), but she's one of the more bullet hell style fights, so my top advice is keep moving. Some defensive orbitals would be useful, plus like someone already mentioned, 4.5 Volt is particularly helpful in longer fights
I got a dead god and i'm going for the second, and I still don't know how to dodge her worm attack. Just tank it or get invincibility items/dry baby/orbitals, that's usually what carries me
No shame on hitting speed restarts til you get a top tier first floor or two
If you tell us what of her attacks give you more trouble we can help you with specific tips, this reads more like a rant than like a help request.
i think mother and the path to mother is more about learning enemies. mother is pretty easy after you learn a few gimmicks and her patterns but the path to her through things like ashpit and gehenna are rough, if you get those variants of alt floors. the thing about mother is there’s no time limit so you can always min max and imo always should. i never have a short mother run, i always milk every single floor, because you’ll need it.
still surprised I managed to beat her with the Lost at this point
It's hard to make tips when you don't think about what you're doing, but I guess a good thing to do is either pay attention to the attacks or just watch [this](https://youtu.be/J9wyHG2T294?si=uLIo48YISwfY-Vp8) for help on how how dodge
More skill less issue
which one theres 2 the green one or the one with the heels.

4.5 volt + Book of Shadows is sooo good.

    I know you mean delirium,

but Mega Stan’s 4 sins wave is actually quite unfair if your items are garbage

Mother’s attacks are fair
        And mother impossible if you don't have a lt least a defensive item
            No it’s possible. You just need to practice. Her attacks are set
Who is the worst boss in your opinion?
    Probably Delirium.  You can take unavoidable damage in that fight.  All damage against mother is fair.
        Besides the damn fistula attack otherwise it’s probably my second favorite boss after hush, it’s just a bit of a slog to get there with sucky characters.
            Tbf, even the fistula attack is probably completely avoidable with practice
                I’m sure but if I’m dying to mother it’s gonna be on the first phase
        Very true.
She is the second end game boss with most bs. Way more than mega Satan, more than hush, way more than The beast
    Mega satan and the beast are extremely easy bosses, especially mega satan. Hush and mother are the best bosses in the game imo, no bullshit, skill required, not impossible but neither too easy. The cum boss is terrible and should be reworked
    All I hear from you is a massive skill issue tbh
        Maybe.
I'm probsbly not good enough to beat Mother with normal character, but I've beaten delirium with the lost so it seems mother is harder which is my point
    Name one BS phase
        The vertical and horizontal tearlones have a phase when you can't see the next shot path.

The rotating phase leaves you no opening if it happens to start when you are in the wrong corner
            You can see it, it’s just overlaid on top of the previous shot pattern. 

I’ll give you the rotating one, but that can be avoided by staying out of corners during phase changes
    If you have no items, mega Stan’s 4 sins wave is pretty bs. 

If your speed is low like Magdalene, it’s impossible to dodge dogma’s spinning dash attack. Also Ultra Death’s skull attack is bs

Mother’s attacks can be learned and she can be beaten even with no items
She has fixed BS patterns
    Nah man just like hush after you get to know the pattern it is not really too hard anymore
"at least she is better than delirium" isn't a huge flex
    Idk... I have beaten Delirium multiple times, I've only beat Mother once. It may be because Delirium is a 2x2 space and Mother is a 2x1 room.
        Me too but it's too much of a strong opinion to state to somebody arguing with me
Mother can't telefrag?
    I think he means “Mother can’t telegraph or bombards with tears (unlike a certain cum boss)”
    Every attack she can throw at you is telegraphed, to the point you can even tell which attack it is, think that makes it more fair.
For me i almost always go to dross/downpour just because the patterns aren't super hard and feel fair 90% (exception was me getting keeper unlocks like wooden nickel/a coin) of the time but i'll only go to mines/mausoleum if i'm going to mother just because of how much harder they are compared to caves/depths
    Yeah for sure. Imo, mines is at least mostly fair. Ashpit bosses like clutch, singe, and Gideon can go off themselves

Meanwhile I still have absolutely no idea what visage does besides some chains, spinning? Brimstone, random bullets, more chains, energy balls, things, attack. Seriously every time I thought I know what to expect, he pulls off a new attack

Mausoleum is where I become paranoid in every single room
        Only reasonable ashpit boss is shell
            Fr. Even pile is somewhat bs, just not as bs as others
                With base keeper or maggy speed i'd say he's unfair
                    Tru. At this point I might even prefer a long boss room than a small one, cuz at least there’s a certainty of which boss I’ll face
I meant in the way that they're much harder than regular Basement. Also my current laptop runs Dross in like 15 fps lol.
Yea, there’s a visual cue. Very simple stuff
External mod desc was what made me double dip.  So helpful.
