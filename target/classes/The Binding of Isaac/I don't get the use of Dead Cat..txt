[[I don't get the use of Dead Cat.]]


I'm very new to the game, but this item seems kind of...terrble. It respawns you with one health, which would be great if it didn't spawn you *outside the room you were just in*, meaning if you died on a difficult encounter or a boss, you have to start all over. It just seems like it's forcing you to bash your head against a wall, but every time you get knocked out, it shocks you awake and goes "you're welcome for letting you hit your head on the wall again". Do any more experienced players have any advice?


For the Lost, it gives you 9 extra Losts! So damn handy.
    So many "bad" items are killer with the Lost. Glass Cannon anyone?
    Imo it sucks
The thing about Dead Cat is that the better you are at the game, the better the item becomes. Once you die your aim is to dodge until you get some soul hearts as a buffer, then trading away the red hearts in a devil deal since having no health containers makes certain items like Whore of Babylon and the Polaroid always have their effects, and the revival effect can be used to trade away lives for devil deals. Dead Cat also contributes to the Guppy transformation, which is far and away the best transformation in the game period, and is enough to win you the run.

If you have no soul hearts available and you aren't able to get back to a comfortable amount of health? Then yeah, you're in for a bad time.
    I appreciate the advice! I'm sorta new to roguelites- the only other ones I've played are Hades and a mobile game called Shattered Pixel Dungeon. With Hades, I didn't like certain builds or weapons, because my thought process was "why would I be a glass cannon when I can just be a regular cannon", but here it seems the philosophy is more "If I'm going to be made of glass, might as well be a glass cannon"- hence why I'm liking Azazel so far!
        Hopefully you'll have even more fun with the game in the future! One of the things that makes Isaac my favorite roguelite are the how the item synergies, item variety, and knowledge of game mechanics makes each run fresh compared to how most others usually have a set loadout you'll want to get to, which is why things that seem bad at first like Dead Cat can easily be turned around to benefit you immensely. Azazel's also a good pick for a character to learn the game with, the flight and mini-brimstone make him very good, and once you've gotten enough experience you'll probably like the other powerful glass cannons Judas, Eve, and the Lost (though you'll probably want to avoid the item Glass Cannon unless you're the Lost).
            I'm on a run right now where I got triple shot as Azazel, and I just picked up Mutant Spider, which means I'm now firing 12 brimstone shots. Granted, they take forever to charge up, but it annihilates shit! I can see what you mean- while the randomness and lack of a defined build can mean you're kind of floundering for good items sometimes, it also leads to fun stuff like this!
            (Also, I'm enjoying Eve too!)
        There aren't many glass cannon builds I can think of in Hades haha, unless you mean like going full cast build with poseidon's blade, idk
You're never really that squishy in Hades
(If you haven't yet, unlock Lucifer it's the funnest weapon in the game, it's a form of the rifle, turns it into a beam weapon and straight murders) 

But yeah, I've been playing roguelites for like 10 years, played them all, I wouldn't say I'm a master or anything I die and get hit like anyone else sometimes, but that said I totally agree with your argument against the cat haha
Sure, 9 lives..but for some reason getting 5 containers and buffs seems way more reliable than 1 heart and a sketchy respawn
            I was referring to Guan Yu in particular- I just can't deal with that massively gimped health.
                Oh man, totally, I literally unlocked that just to get the other aspects and never looked back haha, didn't even think of it.
You can output just as much damage from casts, boons, brit builds, duos and a million other ways without the massive health debuff for sure haha, I'm with you there. 
Honestly I'd just rather face tank some damage so you can get in a big hit than have to be extra careful
With furies/hydra it isn't hard to not get hit, with thesius you can kite asterius while dodging his shots but usually you take a few hits in his boon phase, with hades I usually need at least 1 defiance, unless I'm rocking like the ares duo where you're a spinning death blade or a lucifer aphrodite beam nuke and kill him in seconds haha 

But yeah, fuck guan yu
Dead cat can screw you up a bit, but normally if you are dying over and over with it you would have died anyway. I wouldnt take it if you have lots of red hearts unless you already have a guppy item, then maybe.

Its good when you have low red hearts and high soul hearts which is the goal for most players. You get a guppy item that has no downside if done right, and can save you later
    No you wouldnt die anyway cause if I lose a heart on a room I don't teleport back outside
Many players pick Dead Cat not because of its actual item effect, but because it contributes to a certain transformation. When you pick up three items related to Guppy the cat, you will gain flight, and each tear that hits an enemy will spawn a blue fly which will deal 1.5x damage to any enemy it hits, significantly boosting your damage output.

The item effect itself is not very useful indeed, but if you already have low health by the time you pick it up, its drawback of setting your HP to 1 is not that bad. In fact, once you regain your health, Dead Cat will be a straight improvement in a sense of "it's better to have it than not have it". Sure, trying to beat a boss with just one heart in 9 tries is difficult, but it's arguably better than not having any extra tries at all after losing. (Though it may be a time waste if it seems impossible to defeat a boss with one heart.) 

There is also a certain challenge... thing, where Dead Cat becomes extremely useful. I won't spoil what that thing is, since it's fairly late-game, but once you unlock a specific trinket as Isaac and look up what it does (it's extremely difficult to figure out what it does on your own, as it seems to do nothing when you pick it up), you'll know why Dead Cat is useful for it.
It's good, because you can die 9 times and respawn 9 times. :P
>which would be great if it didn't spawn you *outside the room you were just in*

That can be really annoying if you happen to get yourself stuck in a curse room.

Edit: I should add that should only happen from The Womb onwards.
Damn, Guppy's Full Body can be a interesting item, and as a beginner player i also thought whats the point of it, however when you get better at the game you realise that it can be very broken for devil deals, as it can basically be a free item towards guppy, allow you to buy another item without spending any soul hearts or even allow for activation of certain items that are based on HP, and adds 9 lives for the lost. Personally i tend to play with at most 2/3 red heart containers, this is because red hp, can be a problem in later floors, but if you are a person who likes to have a lot of red heart containers dont pick up this item. However as you get better you will see the problems with red hearts, and start to see them more and more as currency to bargain with the devil with, especially when it comes to items like Abaddon
I like taking it because it gives you one heart container if you don't have one, meaning you can take another devil deal.
I know this is an old topic, but I absolutely agree that it putting you outside the room you died in is really grating and annoying.
Its good for devil deals and for damacles
