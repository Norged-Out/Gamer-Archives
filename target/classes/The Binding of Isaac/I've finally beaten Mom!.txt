[[I've finally beaten Mom!]]





Bro i had a hard time beating >!the beast!<, and this legend's defeated the mom!?
    the mom
        THE mom
            DA MOM
                Dababy
                    TheInfant
                        Dachild
                            Disaac

    My god…
    Technically The Beast is Mom
        what? it's literally called the beast, one can't get more specific than that
            Well technically Isaac is Mom
                Well technically speaking, Isaac is dead, so mom's dead too then
                    Well, technically speaking, isaac and his mother lived alone in a small house on a hill.
            I'm not sure but I'm pretty sure it's never actually referred to as "the beast" in Repentance it is referred to as mother though 

Edit: I am incorrect
                LITERALLY in the bestiary, the name holder for the thing says the beast so i cannot see how u missed that

yes i did just come to an 8 month old comment to say that what about it XD
                    Ah, I never look at the bestiary.
        The beast is supposed to represent religion viewed through the eyes of dogma the face of the true evil that’s why you face dogma the boss as it is the rhetoric that protects the true beast behind it all.
            Well the dad in the end literally calls the beast mother of harlets
        Well, the plot is confusing but mom is not the beast
            Mom is the beast, just look at the clothes beast has at the end of the neck, that is mom's dress.
                Oh, I never realised the dress
    He’s the true legend
Congrats man. Good luck on this new and fresh adventure that you definitely aren't a master of already 😉
    Damn what the hell did the people under me say
    Look at the left
        I did.
That's what the 😉 is for
            Sry my bad

                Don't down vote him saying sorry, gosh
                    I really don't care about the downvotes... But damn
                        I downvoted to contribute to the -450 score cause that's hilarious, you said you don't care anyway.
                            Let me go to the oblivion guys!! I want the 1k downvotes
                                The prophecies spoke of this one, in the old writings. He dwells in that darkness that is downvotes, draws power from it. The end is neigh.
                                You really are going to be Forgotten if the downvotes continue
                                Ayy, 1k downvotes
                        I just downvoted cause I thought you could get a his core of 80, just downvote yourself and you'll get a record
                            I don't have word to describe you... I don't want to insult you.
                            Well nevermind
                                I just did that, Congruts!! Highscore
                                    Omfg YES!!! I BROKE THE CUP OF 80
                        Redditors always think the downvote is a disagree button...
                            i mean it kind of is no? just shows what the person is saying doesnt reflect the opinion of others

or something just being poor taste gets downvoted
                    I got downvoted for absolutely no reason, honest question. "Dont act like you know what ur talking about" THEN ANSWER IT BY CORRECTING ME DONT BE A D***
        June 2, 2021: The downvotes incident
        You just missed le joke! HahA! r/woshoshosh!
            jokaireee!
                Penniwaiz
                ho' my gosh!
            I hoped this was a real sub. I was wrong
                It is now.
        Gee 450 downvotes ? This sub has no chill xD
            I see xD. Now i read two times before post xD
                [deleted]
                    May the force be with me
        Can someone say why do you downvote me so much, I beg your pardon to not understand the joke but.. Gosh...
            Once something has a few downvotes, everybody just piles on. Asking why you're getting downvotes can also lead to lots more downvotes - just cos. I upvoted you to cancel some out.
                Downvoted you just for mentioning the downvoting.
                    That's fair.
                I downvoted you too, to make myself feel like a true redditor
            Isaac subreddit for some reason is one of the places that downvotes stuff into oblivion really fast. 

My most controversial comment had like 80 downvotes until I brought proof, after which I actually got slightly into plus again and was me mentioning that Holy Water had a chance to appear in Afterbirths devil deals. ([Here is the comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/bindingofisaac/comments/6gdi74/950_hours_in_this_game_and_this_is_the_first_time/dipmvh1/) 
and just to be safe: [Here is the picture of proof](https://i.imgur.com/ZbIVyAM.jpg). (this was AB without mods, never installed mods before AB+)


A second comment I still got in good memory is me mentioning that, if you use Mama Mega, you don't need to beat Mom to get into Boss Rush, you can immediately enter the door, do Boss Rush and then go back into the Mom fight (which is useful if you have a high chance for a deal which you don't want to waste). 

This comment was made during a time where console was easily avaible for all, meaning checking that fact would've taken like 3 minutes, yet at some point I was at 20 or 30 dislikes, despite the much smaller sub back then.
                What a find. Never expected that.
        Havent seen this much downvotes thru my 1 year of reddit
            Even, but if I can break a record or something, get me down this FUCKING Oblivion xD
            have you seen the EA comment?
                No
        "you definitely aren't a master of already"
        r/woooosh

                        noooo

        "that you definitely arent a master of already"
        call me
        You know what? Fuck you

*downvotes your -901 comment*

Edit: you downvoted me but now you're at -1150 you STINKY
        Over a thousand downvotes, I have NEVER seen anything even close to that before
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xECUrlnXCqk
        Wtf man 560 downvotes? Most comments don't reach 500 upvotes
        r/karmaroulette
    Even though he has a file eight next to it where he almost completed the file xd.
        r/wooooosh
            drop an "o" to link to the correct sub
                r/woooosh

like so
        dead god means the file is 100% done
            Yeah its aaalmost like the post is labelled shitpost or something like that
                lol I'm aware, just corrected his "he *almost* completed the file" statement
                    Always glad when a person's sense of humour isn't up their own arse
                        Potato is correcting Pitushi, Vinzo, not correcting OP
                        What just happened lol I think you were the only one not in on the joke
                            I'm used to it lol
You just have an impressive amount of hours into the game to beat such a difficult boss
    Yeah, dogs are pretty hard to beat 😔 took me 45 tries to beat a single one.
        Everyone hates Capra Demon, don’t worry.
        MOM is harder than greed

                                    [deleted]
                bruh it's a joke
        r/whoosh
        This guy is obviously lying, he even said Pin is an easy boss
I bet u had the Bible 😡 There's no other way to beat that boss, the hardest boss by far
    bro the bibles just an urban legend 😡 It doesn't exist. they even made one IRL and filled it with unbelievable stories to reference the urban legend from the Binding of Isaac
        I tried using bible on mom IRL and it worked!!!!
        Can confirm I’ve played 800+ hours on pc and console and never had the bible. Heard it’s only on switch as an in game purchase..
    He used mods to get the bibble 😡😡🤬🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬🤬😡🤬😡
        Everyone starts with bible
            Bibble**
    I know we're all memeing hard in this thread but Mom is actually a harder fight than It Lives for me
    Okay but no joke, after it took ages for me to find the Bible to unlock the Halo in Flash Isaac, when Rebirth launched I got it my very first run.

I was so mad too, since I couldn't go on to fight Mom's Heart because it was my "first" Mom kill
Any tips for clearing depths 1? Have had this game for 400+ hours and I still haven't beaten mom.
    Haven’t beaten mom yet either but i find it easier if you unlock megamush to get those i frames
        Sounds like a weaker version of breath of life. I don't know if I can take an item that is so obviously bad for my run when I can just take breath of life which gives me those iframes anytime on demand.
            why take either when isaac's heart exists? makes you literally immortal.
        I think the bullet hell segment with mom’s foot is the hardest part. It just hits me every time.
            As someone trying to get the forgotten on my current save

This but unironically
    Unlock godhead, its really strong especially in depths 1
        Barely managed to clear basement 1 with Polyphemus + Rock bottom. Hoping for the death certificate on basement 2 so I can take sacred heart/Godhead. Hopefully that should be enough, but I'm ready to be disappointed.
            Are you crazy? Dont ever Pick up Polyphemus that items kills your run
                It lowers your tears all for some stupid pseudo piercing that doesn't even work!
            I see what you all are doing here.
                btw really never pick up angel pool items, they're trick items that have a hidden side effect, usually killing you quickly
                    Just like most religions then?
                        Fun fact! This was an intentional joke from Edmund
        But it's way better in basement 1, reset until it shows up
    Depths 1 is a real bastard. You pretty much need an Ewaz rune or We Need to go Deeper and just skip to Depths 2.
    Try to unlock Death Certificate. Its a great item that should help you a lot with beating mom.
    Wait for the skull things to pop out before yoy shoot them. It took me 400 hours to kill one too
        One semi-reliable method that I use; if you have any bombs, just go near it and place a bomb. Don't run away otherwise it won't open. You will take some damage from the explosion, but it's worth it to kill them, even if it loses the run. Sometimes I use 4-5 bombs because I mess up the timing.
            Or just shoot them?
    Try Trisagion and IPECAC. That's a synergy that melts Mom in seconds. :)
    I syill suck at this game and recently I checked how many hours I have... 1900. I HAVE 1900 HOURS OF ISAAC REBIRTH WHAT THE HELL AM I DOING WITH MY LIFE. AND IM STILL A NOOB WHO KEEPS HIS FINGER ON THE R KEY

Edit: not only I have 1900 HOURS but I just realised that I BARELY played afterbirth + and havent played in hears before repentance. All those hours are from a few year at the beginning what the hell
        Just become back your money? It's a shit of piece game anyway, and the developer might in his next life be a cow on a trash farm. It's just fucking bad.
        That finger on the r key is a must for every player with 500h +
            Imagine the maniac who has every achievement exceot the one for the r key
can't wait for the updated post when you defeat mom's heart!
    Wait there is more????!!!
        No, you did it all. Isaac is maybe a 30 minute long game
            500 hours in and still haven’t beat monstro, how is this a thirty minute game !?!?!?!??!!?
                ONLY if you beat it FRIST Try 

And no joke

THAT IS VERY improbable
            Actually, according to the Wikipedia page, it is. Mom is the final boss according to Wikipedia (look it up it's pretty interesting)
    Bruh dont spoiler them!
Can't you see that they only beat mom so far?!
    Lol nobody's ever done that before, I doubt OP will be able to
You seem like you know your way around this game. How do I kill those black flies?
    I don't know, luckily I didn't find any yet
    Hold R
Make sure to play on hard mode! A lot of newbies play on normal !
    Wait, am I doing it wrong playing on normal?
        Yeah you should probably delete your save file and start a new one on hard. Once you play on normal once you're locked out of getting the hard mode achievements
            Wait really?!
                [deleted]
                    Oh thank God.
                        Just play hard mode to get the items.
                        The reason to do hard mode is because in that way foi evolve sligthy faster and get achieviments in Double the speed
    hi, thick dipshit here, is this sarcasm?
        Sort of, but also ok advice. Hard mode gives unique unlocks, and if you plan on getting completion marks on each character, you'll need to do their endings twice if you play them first on normal mode.

Ultimately though, the game is supposed to be fun, so play it however you want to
            >the game is supposed to be fun

[citation needed]
        This whole post and all the comments are sarcastic. Play on whatever mode makes you happy
        I'm very curious on why you got down voted so much, have an upvote.
            I think it was because they thought i was calling the op a thick dipshit, when, in fact, i was refering to myself, having an extremely hard time differentiating sarcasm from earnest remarks.
Congluturations!
    My theory: People write Congratz because none knows how to write Congratjulashons
        You write like that



CONGRATULAÇÕES 


or


CONGRATULATIONS
Smh probably used mods
    Filthy cheaters on this sub, I swear!
I see what you did there
amazing! i hope you enjoy the rest of the game! :D

        r/wooosh
            Also r/woooosh (not woooshing you im just adding another)
            Damn
Enjoy the game! Try out every item you see
    Specially Ipecac with that item called trisagion, the most OP synergy in the game
GG! Being a NEW PLAYER surely is hard, but i bet one day you will get Dead god!
    I hope you saw the image
        Why do you think I mentioned the dead god achievement?
            Ok
ISAAC 2 CONFIRMED??
Me too, then I played isaac.
Holy shit dude, that's impossible to do! We have a god amongst us.
    did you just say "amountst us"🔫🤨⁉️
Fuck you mom was gonna get me McDonalds and now she can't... Cause she's dead.
    Free McDonalds meal, I guess
GG! (I'm not blind, I'm leagaly blind)
Lmao, good one
Why did you do it on a new save though? Now you have to do it all over gain on the one to the left smh
You're going to love the rest of the-

...wait a goddamn minute.
I wanna beat mom but I'm dummy thicc and my asschecks keep bumping into explosive mushrooms.
Quality meme
I cant get past the basement 2 you are already better than me
    Wait basement 2 exist?
        Yeah i had to restart until i got tech x to make it to there
They died so many times on file one, they were locked out and theirs a skull. Somehow they beat mom, I’m still trying too.
Does anyone know how to shoot?
Congrats, that is the last boss in the game, time to quit
Wow, amazing! Great job!  You should definitely try unlocking death certificate so you can use it in Depths
Dead god
Where the fuck did you get C Section
    Death Certificate
        Oh btw it's unfinished
Great but wait until you face The duke of flies
Funny thing is Edmund once said that a guy actually told him he beat the game/mom while being serious lol
Wo, good job! Im personally still having trouble with basement II
Hmmmm I wonder why the file on the right says god eh it’s probably nothing nice job man real proud of you !!!!
Way to go, but should I tell you that this is merely the beginning!
    look at the left
        💀
Congrats :3 (shush i see dead god there)
Lol
Nice on the mom kill!
Congrats dude!
I want to hate you but I cant
I love how you are so bragging that you killed mom, and have dead god, also I am better than ya, I beaten MONSTRO.
Why are you playing on file 2? That's twice as hard as file 1. Just delete all your saves now while you're still ahead!
You beat the game! Time to uninstall it and get a new one.
Woohoo!!!
ITT: People who can't imagine someone sharing a PC.
    Look at the post flair
L
For all the people commenting about the save file on the left, you can get that easily from various websites. The game is the most fun when you have access to all the items and characters. If you want endless hours without being pressured into fighting some specific boss with a specific character just to unlock some stuff, then complete save files are for you
    It was just a meme
        Silly me. Thanks for clarifying
    Doesn’t that completely counter the point of the game?
        Not to everyone. And I get it, not everyone wants to beat purist for example.
            What was that again? Simply no treasure rooms or?
                No treasure, basic Isaac, beat it lives. No. Not again.
...because you definitely haven’t on file 1?
    r/whoosh
        I knew someone won't get it
            I'm new to the game so didn't get it too. I beat mom on my 4th try after I got the Bible lol
                If you still don't get it: the savefile to the left is 100% complete.
        3 - 4 o's is the sub
        The original woooosh sub is r/woooosh
    Do you even look at the flair
        my guy it was a joke - a shitty one yes but not worth any negative responses
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmh
In several ways.
Hope you enjoy your fresh adventure!
I wish my save files looked like this
congratulations man ur on ur way to mom’s heart in a little bit!
Hol' up.
DING DONG THE WICKED BITCH IS DEAD
wow man congrats, now to the rest of the bosses
OH MUH GOD YOU FINALLY DID IT
First of many times
Ya dun did it, son!
Pog

Keep Up The Great Work
I started a new file with the DLC and I only recently started having some free time to actually play. Looking forward to see NL's playing from launch to see what bugs I may have missed out on. He encountered some weird ones at the previous DLCs.
I only just beat the beast for the first time
Congrats, but you'll have to beat mom multiple times if you want to progress in the game!
Yooo congrats im still on the duke of flies myself
And dead god XD
Lol I remember I was playing tboi and I accidentally started boss rush and somehow survived, it was my first successful run
I remember my first mom fight. I was so unbelievably overpowered that i got the wrong impression and thought she was easier than pin until the very next run where i only got the bean as a passive and a bunch of underwhelming actives. Got my ass schooled real fast
Just unlocked poleroid and negative myself for the first time, but having a real hard time with the game now and haven't won a run since :(
I honestly need to know, what is the purpose of using other save files? Is it tied to the achievements? I have only been using one save file from the start.
    I have completed the first one and unlocking is more fun to me. I want to get all 3 save files done for the look once. The 2nd one is from the start and 3rd one modded, but im not gonna start now
nice man! but a long way to go tho
What is the other save?
    Empty, do you have eyes
YOOOO you're like 80% through the whole game
holy shit bro!
i'm at 150 hours and i haven't beaten mom yet, any tips for not dying on basement 1?

somebody once suggested console but i died still :(
Oh, you think your soooo good beating Mom, eh? Well, BOYO, I'll have you know I have defeated a fly. What you got on THAT, huh?
wait until you get the alt path!
Plot twist
They are not making a joke

It Just one save file is for his bro and the one mom was Basten is for them
oh
Well played kiddo
After beating hush ive hit a corner on what to do, how do you unlock mom fight?
*looks to the left of the picture*
Seriously just like 2 inches on the other side
Foreshadowing be like:
![img](emote|t5_2sxpk|2357)![img](emote|t5_2sxpk|2357)![img](emote|t5_2sxpk|2357)
That's amazing! I hope you can progress to Satan or issac
Congrats, that’s a pretty big feat
yay!!!!

Technically The Beast is Mom
    what? it's literally called the beast, one can't get more specific than that
        Well technically Isaac is Mom
            Well technically speaking, Isaac is dead, so mom's dead too then
                Well, technically speaking, isaac and his mother lived alone in a small house on a hill.
        I'm not sure but I'm pretty sure it's never actually referred to as "the beast" in Repentance it is referred to as mother though 

Edit: I am incorrect
            LITERALLY in the bestiary, the name holder for the thing says the beast so i cannot see how u missed that

yes i did just come to an 8 month old comment to say that what about it XD
                Ah, I never look at the bestiary.
    The beast is supposed to represent religion viewed through the eyes of dogma the face of the true evil that’s why you face dogma the boss as it is the rhetoric that protects the true beast behind it all.

                May the force be with me
    Can someone say why do you downvote me so much, I beg your pardon to not understand the joke but.. Gosh...
        Once something has a few downvotes, everybody just piles on. Asking why you're getting downvotes can also lead to lots more downvotes - just cos. I upvoted you to cancel some out.
            Downvoted you just for mentioning the downvoting.
                That's fair.
            I downvoted you too, to make myself feel like a true redditor
        Isaac subreddit for some reason is one of the places that downvotes stuff into oblivion really fast. 

My most controversial comment had like 80 downvotes until I brought proof, after which I actually got slightly into plus again and was me mentioning that Holy Water had a chance to appear in Afterbirths devil deals. ([Here is the comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/bindingofisaac/comments/6gdi74/950_hours_in_this_game_and_this_is_the_first_time/dipmvh1/) 
and just to be safe: [Here is the picture of proof](https://i.imgur.com/ZbIVyAM.jpg). (this was AB without mods, never installed mods before AB+)


A second comment I still got in good memory is me mentioning that, if you use Mama Mega, you don't need to beat Mom to get into Boss Rush, you can immediately enter the door, do Boss Rush and then go back into the Mom fight (which is useful if you have a high chance for a deal which you don't want to waste). 

This comment was made during a time where console was easily avaible for all, meaning checking that fact would've taken like 3 minutes, yet at some point I was at 20 or 30 dislikes, despite the much smaller sub back then.
            What a find. Never expected that.
    Havent seen this much downvotes thru my 1 year of reddit

    This guy is obviously lying, he even said Pin is an easy boss
bro the bibles just an urban legend 😡 It doesn't exist. they even made one IRL and filled it with unbelievable stories to reference the urban legend from the Binding of Isaac
    I tried using bible on mom IRL and it worked!!!!
    Can confirm I’ve played 800+ hours on pc and console and never had the bible. Heard it’s only on switch as an in game purchase..
He used mods to get the bibble 😡😡🤬🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬🤬😡🤬😡
    Everyone starts with bible
        Bibble**
I know we're all memeing hard in this thread but Mom is actually a harder fight than It Lives for me
Okay but no joke, after it took ages for me to find the Bible to unlock the Halo in Flash Isaac, when Rebirth launched I got it my very first run.

I was so mad too, since I couldn't go on to fight Mom's Heart because it was my "first" Mom kill
Haven’t beaten mom yet either but i find it easier if you unlock megamush to get those i frames
    Sounds like a weaker version of breath of life. I don't know if I can take an item that is so obviously bad for my run when I can just take breath of life which gives me those iframes anytime on demand.
        why take either when isaac's heart exists? makes you literally immortal.
    I think the bullet hell segment with mom’s foot is the hardest part. It just hits me every time.
        As someone trying to get the forgotten on my current save

This but unironically
Unlock godhead, its really strong especially in depths 1
    Barely managed to clear basement 1 with Polyphemus + Rock bottom. Hoping for the death certificate on basement 2 so I can take sacred heart/Godhead. Hopefully that should be enough, but I'm ready to be disappointed.
        Are you crazy? Dont ever Pick up Polyphemus that items kills your run
            It lowers your tears all for some stupid pseudo piercing that doesn't even work!
        I see what you all are doing here.
            btw really never pick up angel pool items, they're trick items that have a hidden side effect, usually killing you quickly
                Just like most religions then?
                    Fun fact! This was an intentional joke from Edmund
    But it's way better in basement 1, reset until it shows up
Depths 1 is a real bastard. You pretty much need an Ewaz rune or We Need to go Deeper and just skip to Depths 2.
Try to unlock Death Certificate. Its a great item that should help you a lot with beating mom.
Wait for the skull things to pop out before yoy shoot them. It took me 400 hours to kill one too
    One semi-reliable method that I use; if you have any bombs, just go near it and place a bomb. Don't run away otherwise it won't open. You will take some damage from the explosion, but it's worth it to kill them, even if it loses the run. Sometimes I use 4-5 bombs because I mess up the timing.
        Or just shoot them?
Try Trisagion and IPECAC. That's a synergy that melts Mom in seconds. :)
I syill suck at this game and recently I checked how many hours I have... 1900. I HAVE 1900 HOURS OF ISAAC REBIRTH WHAT THE HELL AM I DOING WITH MY LIFE. AND IM STILL A NOOB WHO KEEPS HIS FINGER ON THE R KEY

Edit: not only I have 1900 HOURS but I just realised that I BARELY played afterbirth + and havent played in hears before repentance. All those hours are from a few year at the beginning what the hell
    Just become back your money? It's a shit of piece game anyway, and the developer might in his next life be a cow on a trash farm. It's just fucking bad.
    That finger on the r key is a must for every player with 500h +
        Imagine the maniac who has every achievement exceot the one for the r key
Wait there is more????!!!
    No, you did it all. Isaac is maybe a 30 minute long game
        500 hours in and still haven’t beat monstro, how is this a thirty minute game !?!?!?!??!!?
            ONLY if you beat it FRIST Try 

And no joke

THAT IS VERY improbable
        Actually, according to the Wikipedia page, it is. Mom is the final boss according to Wikipedia (look it up it's pretty interesting)
Bruh dont spoiler them!
Can't you see that they only beat mom so far?!
Lol nobody's ever done that before, I doubt OP will be able to
I don't know, luckily I didn't find any yet
Hold R
Wait, am I doing it wrong playing on normal?
    Yeah you should probably delete your save file and start a new one on hard. Once you play on normal once you're locked out of getting the hard mode achievements
        Wait really?!
            [deleted]
                Oh thank God.
                    Just play hard mode to get the items.
                    The reason to do hard mode is because in that way foi evolve sligthy faster and get achieviments in Double the speed
hi, thick dipshit here, is this sarcasm?
    Sort of, but also ok advice. Hard mode gives unique unlocks, and if you plan on getting completion marks on each character, you'll need to do their endings twice if you play them first on normal mode.

Ultimately though, the game is supposed to be fun, so play it however you want to
        >the game is supposed to be fun

[citation needed]
    This whole post and all the comments are sarcastic. Play on whatever mode makes you happy
    I'm very curious on why you got down voted so much, have an upvote.
        I think it was because they thought i was calling the op a thick dipshit, when, in fact, i was refering to myself, having an extremely hard time differentiating sarcasm from earnest remarks.
My theory: People write Congratz because none knows how to write Congratjulashons
    You write like that

    Oh btw it's unfinished
look at the left

Look at the post flair
It was just a meme
    Silly me. Thanks for clarifying
Doesn’t that completely counter the point of the game?
    Not to everyone. And I get it, not everyone wants to beat purist for example.
        What was that again? Simply no treasure rooms or?
            No treasure, basic Isaac, beat it lives. No. Not again.
r/whoosh
    I knew someone won't get it
        I'm new to the game so didn't get it too. I beat mom on my 4th try after I got the Bible lol
            If you still don't get it: the savefile to the left is 100% complete.
    3 - 4 o's is the sub
    The original woooosh sub is r/woooosh
Do you even look at the flair
    my guy it was a joke - a shitty one yes but not worth any negative responses
I have completed the first one and unlocking is more fun to me. I want to get all 3 save files done for the look once. The 2nd one is from the start and 3rd one modded, but im not gonna start now
Empty, do you have eyes

what? it's literally called the beast, one can't get more specific than that
    Well technically Isaac is Mom
        Well technically speaking, Isaac is dead, so mom's dead too then
            Well, technically speaking, isaac and his mother lived alone in a small house on a hill.
    I'm not sure but I'm pretty sure it's never actually referred to as "the beast" in Repentance it is referred to as mother though 

Edit: I am incorrect
        LITERALLY in the bestiary, the name holder for the thing says the beast so i cannot see how u missed that

yes i did just come to an 8 month old comment to say that what about it XD
            Ah, I never look at the bestiary.
The beast is supposed to represent religion viewed through the eyes of dogma the face of the true evil that’s why you face dogma the boss as it is the rhetoric that protects the true beast behind it all.
    Well the dad in the end literally calls the beast mother of harlets
Well, the plot is confusing but mom is not the beast
    Mom is the beast, just look at the clothes beast has at the end of the neck, that is mom's dress.

    Actually, according to the Wikipedia page, it is. Mom is the final boss according to Wikipedia (look it up it's pretty interesting)
Yeah you should probably delete your save file and start a new one on hard. Once you play on normal once you're locked out of getting the hard mode achievements
    Wait really?!
        [deleted]
            Oh thank God.
                Just play hard mode to get the items.
                The reason to do hard mode is because in that way foi evolve sligthy faster and get achieviments in Double the speed
Sort of, but also ok advice. Hard mode gives unique unlocks, and if you plan on getting completion marks on each character, you'll need to do their endings twice if you play them first on normal mode.

Ultimately though, the game is supposed to be fun, so play it however you want to
    >the game is supposed to be fun

[citation needed]
This whole post and all the comments are sarcastic. Play on whatever mode makes you happy
I'm very curious on why you got down voted so much, have an upvote.
    I think it was because they thought i was calling the op a thick dipshit, when, in fact, i was refering to myself, having an extremely hard time differentiating sarcasm from earnest remarks.
You write like that

    Also r/woooosh (not woooshing you im just adding another)
    Damn
Why do you think I mentioned the dead god achievement?
    Ok
Yeah i had to restart until i got tech x to make it to there
Oh btw it's unfinished
💀
Silly me. Thanks for clarifying
Not to everyone. And I get it, not everyone wants to beat purist for example.
    What was that again? Simply no treasure rooms or?
        No treasure, basic Isaac, beat it lives. No. Not again.
I knew someone won't get it
    I'm new to the game so didn't get it too. I beat mom on my 4th try after I got the Bible lol
        If you still don't get it: the savefile to the left is 100% complete.
3 - 4 o's is the sub
The original woooosh sub is r/woooosh
my guy it was a joke - a shitty one yes but not worth any negative responses

Well technically Isaac is Mom
    Well technically speaking, Isaac is dead, so mom's dead too then
        Well, technically speaking, isaac and his mother lived alone in a small house on a hill.
I'm not sure but I'm pretty sure it's never actually referred to as "the beast" in Repentance it is referred to as mother though 

Edit: I am incorrect
    LITERALLY in the bestiary, the name holder for the thing says the beast so i cannot see how u missed that

yes i did just come to an 8 month old comment to say that what about it XD
        Ah, I never look at the bestiary.
Well the dad in the end literally calls the beast mother of harlets
Mom is the beast, just look at the clothes beast has at the end of the neck, that is mom's dress.
    Oh, I never realised the dress

            I downvoted to contribute to the -450 score cause that's hilarious, you said you don't care anyway.
                Let me go to the oblivion guys!! I want the 1k downvotes

                    Ayy, 1k downvotes
            I just downvoted cause I thought you could get a his core of 80, just downvote yourself and you'll get a record
                I don't have word to describe you... I don't want to insult you.
                Well nevermind

            Redditors always think the downvote is a disagree button...
                i mean it kind of is no? just shows what the person is saying doesnt reflect the opinion of others

or something just being poor taste gets downvoted
        I got downvoted for absolutely no reason, honest question. "Dont act like you know what ur talking about" THEN ANSWER IT BY CORRECTING ME DONT BE A D***
jokaireee!

I see xD. Now i read two times before post xD

        May the force be with me
Once something has a few downvotes, everybody just piles on. Asking why you're getting downvotes can also lead to lots more downvotes - just cos. I upvoted you to cancel some out.
    Downvoted you just for mentioning the downvoting.
        That's fair.
    I downvoted you too, to make myself feel like a true redditor
Isaac subreddit for some reason is one of the places that downvotes stuff into oblivion really fast. 

My most controversial comment had like 80 downvotes until I brought proof, after which I actually got slightly into plus again and was me mentioning that Holy Water had a chance to appear in Afterbirths devil deals. ([Here is the comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/bindingofisaac/comments/6gdi74/950_hours_in_this_game_and_this_is_the_first_time/dipmvh1/) 
and just to be safe: [Here is the picture of proof](https://i.imgur.com/ZbIVyAM.jpg). (this was AB without mods, never installed mods before AB+)


A second comment I still got in good memory is me mentioning that, if you use Mama Mega, you don't need to beat Mom to get into Boss Rush, you can immediately enter the door, do Boss Rush and then go back into the Mom fight (which is useful if you have a high chance for a deal which you don't want to waste). 

This comment was made during a time where console was easily avaible for all, meaning checking that fact would've taken like 3 minutes, yet at some point I was at 20 or 30 dislikes, despite the much smaller sub back then.
    What a find. Never expected that.
Even, but if I can break a record or something, get me down this FUCKING Oblivion xD
have you seen the EA comment?

why take either when isaac's heart exists? makes you literally immortal.
As someone trying to get the forgotten on my current save

This but unironically
Are you crazy? Dont ever Pick up Polyphemus that items kills your run
    It lowers your tears all for some stupid pseudo piercing that doesn't even work!
I see what you all are doing here.
    btw really never pick up angel pool items, they're trick items that have a hidden side effect, usually killing you quickly
        Just like most religions then?
            Fun fact! This was an intentional joke from Edmund
Or just shoot them?
Imagine the maniac who has every achievement exceot the one for the r key
500 hours in and still haven’t beat monstro, how is this a thirty minute game !?!?!?!??!!?
