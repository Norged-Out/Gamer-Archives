When you eat sulfur and you dont get a blood laser
    ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
    You didnâ€™t I was spewing out a red laser from my mouth. Didnâ€™t feel very good tho.
    Obviously sulfur is a suppository
Guys, please help. I ate some rotten and spoiled food and now I'm sick instead of growing more durable. Have I been lied to?!
    thats what you get for picking up a red heart item, fuckin cringe
        Have you played repentance tho ðŸ¤”
            yh and i havent made it to a boss fight thus far ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž
                g
                    indeed
            *cries in console*

Did they buff red harts? Please explain, I'm curious.
                Red hearts have a higher chance to spawn on Repentance. Furthermore soul hearts are rarer, devil deals are worse, angel rooms are improved, many reasons to try to hold on to red health much of the time.
                They made red heart builds more useful. And as stated in previous comment, devil deals are nerfed for sake of angel rooms.
                More like they nerfed soul hearts
                    They also massively buffed red health
                        red healt wasnâ€˜t bad before but devil deals were the better option
                            The drop rate for red health was so low that it didn't really offer any advantage to soul hearts
        how else am i gonna pay for all those sweet, sweet devil deals? i want my tears to [kill gods](https://thegarages.bandcamp.com/track/fight-gods), you know?
When carrying your dead cat doesn't give you extra lifes and you just fucking die
    when your dogs body doesn't add shrapnel onto shots and instead gets you sent to a mental hospital
        When you kill your mother and all you got was this stupid picture and have to crawl into her womb. *(Typing this out felt weird)*
            When you kill a dove but instead of gaining flight and spectral tears you get labeled as a psychopath
when you eat a dog food but doesn't get a healthup
    It's tasty tho.
        what
            I mean heâ€™s not wrong
            Dog food taste testers. A real job
I find it hilarious that a good 9/10 items should be harmful and/or kill you but in stead...  ALL STATS UP!
    Remember the colour of the magic mushroom, in real life it's a real... Uh... Danger.
    oh yeah, trash items are things that are not bad for you (clothing, food) while good items will kill you (razor blade in an apple, poisonous mushroom) which makes sense, cause things that are bad for you make you cry
        >trash items are things that are not bad for you (clothing, food)

Hey, man, Blanket and PJ's are great
            what I meant were mostly something like moms heels and camo undies
                Camo undies are great with orbitals though
                    Have you had Gemini and camo undies? Stealth run.
                    Are there Items that would kill (or badly hurt)  you irl, which you would pick camo undies over?
                        Straight Razor (Blood Rights), The Razor, bomb vest (Kamikaze), Scissors, Glass Canon, unless you specifically mean passives in which case the Guillotine, Ludovico Technique, Kidney Stone, there's others but they aren't exactly "Items" irl.
                            I will not tolerate Repentance kidney stone slander. That item is insane for boss shredding and I will fight about this
                                I'm just not a fan of an ability that stops me from being able to fight on the regular. Keep in mind, these are things that *I, myself*, would pick Camo Undies over, your milage may vary
                            ok, if that's your opinion on these, yes the active items are shit in most situations, but I myself would take all these passives over camo undies
                                That thanks your opinion. Me? I just can never get the hand of Ludovico unless my build is specifically set up to make amazing use of it, like Brimstone or something. Kidney Stone I'm just not a fan of "You cannot fire now" even if you get a burst after a bit. And the Guillotine I just don't like, it throws off my aim and my ability to keep track of my body and hitbox
TBOI players when putting on their mom's clothes doesn't make the tears out of their eyes fly further
    Speak for yourself
        What?
            # SPEAK FOR YOURSELF
    Let me get the belt, see if that doesn't make you run away fast! (There is a logic to most items and their stats counterpart! )
    But squeezing your mom's pad actually grosses people out.

    Step 1: Eat only boiled potatoes for a day and get constipated

Step 2: Shit and put that petrified poop in your pocket

Step 3: Profit
*Tfw you read the whole bible but still don't get the ability to fly*
    Isaac can read the whole bible at once, that's why it lets him fly for a moment.  You just can't read it fast enough to get the right effect.

One of those slapping-the-chicken-to-cook-it kind of problems.
        *You dare challenge me brÃ¶ther?*
I know this is a joke but let's be serious for a sec guys: Never EVER attempt anything presented on the game, such as getting your dead cat from the devil in exchange of one of your hearts.
    so i should not stick a wirecoat hanger in my head? damn you just ruined my plans for the evening.
        I'm so sorry
        Damn I was gonna put toothpicks in my eyes
    iono, only one heart seems like a steal
        [deleted]
            that's precisely why i said one heart is a steal, my dood.
            Not if you have a silver tongue
Yo guys I used a pair of pinking shears but instead of gaining the ability to give conscience to my body while my head floats alive and well I just decapitated myself
Drank ipecac, I threw up, and it hurt myself to do, so I guess that works the same
When you eat a red heart but your life is still ending
What item is this referring to
    Hey friend not OP but i believe this meme is a reference to no particular item in the game but rather a witty exaggeration of the core mechanic of picking up items to get upgrades. :)
        Ur right
    Mysterious liquid or sulfuric acid i presume
I put rubber cement in my eyes but my tears still don't bounce? 

Any help?
    are you sure? how many fingers are on my hands rn?
        Te- *fucking dies*

    When isaac players put a fetus in a jar and instead of getting bomb tears they get arrested by the hospital guards
you mean I should stop eating chilies and roten bread? :( my life is a lie
    That's not true! You can still eat moldy bread.
No no no silly!,that's how you unlock forgotten in real life you dum dum!
    can you tell me how to use forgotten irl also?
        I didn't yet achieve forgotten as I'm an newbie to Issac and only play in rebirth and I can't have any DLC so I can't test it out
            well now im just a skeleton :(
                I think if you hold the bone for around 3 sec you should be able to throw it
                    And if you let it go then the soul of forgotten should appear
I sold my soul to the devil but I didn't get brimstone
When eating a puberty pill doesn't grow pubes on your head ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
When you wear your momâ€™s panties and donâ€™t actually get a range upgrade in real life
when you get 4 balls of bandages but don't get a girlfriend
I put rubber cement on my eyelids and it made me cry more instead of making my tears bounce ðŸ˜¢
    *Tears way up!*

    Straight Razor (Blood Rights), The Razor, bomb vest (Kamikaze), Scissors, Glass Canon, unless you specifically mean passives in which case the Guillotine, Ludovico Technique, Kidney Stone, there's others but they aren't exactly "Items" irl.
        I will not tolerate Repentance kidney stone slander. That item is insane for boss shredding and I will fight about this
            I'm just not a fan of an ability that stops me from being able to fight on the regular. Keep in mind, these are things that *I, myself*, would pick Camo Undies over, your milage may vary
        ok, if that's your opinion on these, yes the active items are shit in most situations, but I myself would take all these passives over camo undies
            That thanks your opinion. Me? I just can never get the hand of Ludovico unless my build is specifically set up to make amazing use of it, like Brimstone or something. Kidney Stone I'm just not a fan of "You cannot fire now" even if you get a burst after a bit. And the Guillotine I just don't like, it throws off my aim and my ability to keep track of my body and hitbox
And if you let it go then the soul of forgotten should appear
red healt wasnâ€˜t bad before but devil deals were the better option
    The drop rate for red health was so low that it didn't really offer any advantage to soul hearts
