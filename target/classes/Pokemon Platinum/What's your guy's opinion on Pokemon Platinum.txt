[[What's your guy's opinion on Pokemon Platinum]]


I'm a long time Pokemon fan who got into the games in the 3DS era. I wanted to try one of the older games to see if I was missing out. I settled on Platinum as I my older brother really liked it. The game is very hard to find though, my local Disc Replay had one copy for $70. So I just decided to purchase a DS emulator on the Google Play store and try it that way. I would just like a second opinion on this, is Platinum any good?


Honestly in my personal opinion Diamond, Pearl, and platinum is one of the best pokemon games they made, the story line is good, the pokemon selection is nice, and post-end game content is amazing. I wouldn't pay 70$ for it honestly but i would highly recommend playing it
Ive played a bunch of Pokemon games and Platinum is still my personal fav, i deff think it would be in a top 3 pokemon main series games.
It’s my favorite, but I’m biased because Diamond was my first game
    Well, it's my favorite too, and my first game was Alpha Sapphire... It just is such a cool game!
It’s the best Pokemon game IMO. Most of it is probably just nostalgia, but it has one of the best stories in any Pokemon game, has some of my favorite music, gen iv in general introduced some of my favorite Pokemon, it had the best legendaries and events, and it was much less slow and tedious than Diamond & Pearl.
Platinum is probably the best example of the 3rd game in a region, taking place in one of the most memorable regions.

TLDR - Is good
it is a fan favourite

most people on reddit had platinum as the game coming out when they were a kid or in their early teens

be wary that it is slow as fuck, youre in for the long haul if you want to complete this game, if you want a shorter faster experience other gens are better (gen 2 for example)

but if you can deal with the pace, platinum will be the most immersive game in the series.  sinnoh to me feels like the region that is most like a real place. it stands out to me even more now that SWSH are out - Sinnoh feels more like the UK, especially Wales, than Galar ever will.

....opinons may change if they do a bad remake in gen 8. (doesnt seem to be happening)
Platinum was a great game
Ive only played pearl, and loved it. Platinum is way better than pearl so you should play it
Platinum ranks number 5 in the series on my list. It's a solid game, one of the best ever made.
I'm still stuck at Mount Coronet.
The best of the sinnoh games since D/P are mediocre in comparison. Plus more post-game content as well.
I have platinum (and all the other gen 4/5 games) on an R4 card I got a few months ago. Works like a charm.
Extremely overrated but good
Is one of my favorites
Platinum is in my personal top 3 of the best Pokemon games, only behind Heartgold/Soulsilver and Black/White 2. It is definitely a great Pokemon game!
I personally skipped platinum because Sinnoh is kind of a disappointment. They forgot an entire type existed and its a bit of a drag. I would recommend going for Heartgold/SoulSilver if you want a gen 4 game, otherwise play Black/White then Black/White2. The Unova games are arguably the best
    You skipped the best version of sinnoh so your judgement of it is very harsh considering that.
        The lack of any fire types besides Rapidash is kind of a big deal; as far as the region goes I just didnt appreciate the layout and the amount of crisscross backtracking that needed to be done.
            As I said, the lack of fire types is FIXED in Platinum. I think the layout is actually one of its strength. Do you prefer Galar that is literally just a straight line from start to finish?
                I prefer something like Unova or Kalos, where while the route was mostly straight forward, there was enough ability to side track and explore
    Platinum fixed the imbalance of types in Sinnoh, and added some nice post game stuff. On top of that, the story part is much better and the gym leader, E4 and champion teams are improved, too. Also, while D&P certainly were slow at times, Platinum is much quicker!
        Platinum is still really slow
            It's absolutely bearable. It has never reduced my enjoyment of the game, whereas in D&P it definitely was bad.
                It kinda did for me, but I haven’t played Diamond or Pearl so I don’t know how bad it was at first
gewd bideo game
Meh. Those games were so slllloowwwwwwww. Don’t even get me started on the lack of fire types.

Playing the game felt like a chore with all the grinding.

I mean sure the games were fine but that’s it. The story was ok nothing too outstanding.

Maybe it’s because I wasn’t there when it first came out, so I have no feelings for it.
    The fire type problem is fixed in Platinum, and the game is significantly faster than Diamond and Pearl!
        I’m aware that the problem was sort of fixed in platinum but it still wasn’t enough, your only choices were a starter, a rapidash, a houndoom, and a starter evo that not everyone had access too.

And if platinum was considered faster then DP then Jesus Christ DP must’ve been slow as hell, maybe it’s because I’m more used to modern games
            In Platinum you've got the starter, Rapidash, Houndoom, Flareon and Magmortar, so 4-5 fully evolved fire types. For comparison, in Emerald you have the starter, Camerupt, Magcargo, Torkoal and Ninetales, so 4-5 fully evolved fire types - just as much ! Yet, no one ever talks about the lack of fire types in Gen 3 \^\^.

I still think it's totally exaggerated to call Platinum THAT slow. Yes, compared to modern games, it is slower, but it's far from unbearable.
                I completely forgot about flareon

And yeah I guess it is just because I’m used to the pace of modern games, I just recently bought platinum after all
Well, it was okay. But very overrated. It has some decent Pokémon, but you’re held back from using the teams you want because so few of the Pokémon can learn necessary HMs. There’s only a few Pokémon that learn fly, hardly any of them accessible around that point except Staraptor, and a little further Altaria. Very few learn defog and rock climb. Also, there’s some terrible map design, IE a huge area filled with snow that’s all encounter tiles and slows you to a crawl, and you have to find a needed HM in all that; as well as areas with fog that make all attacks except ones like Aerial Ace and Aura Sphere have a chance to miss, which is VERY annoying if you don’t want to waste a move slot for a useless move like defog. What trainer is gonna use stealth rock in the main game? Come on. Also, the health bars take forever to drop or go up. Look up how long it takes a Blissey to faint, it’s ridiculous. With how much those things heal themselves online I imagine that must have wasted so many people’s time back then. And then there’s a few annoying gym puzzles, but every Pokémon game has those except for Alola. It also has a steep level curve at places. It’s upsides are that there are some cool Pokémon added, like Garchomp, Luxray, Gliscor, the starters, the legendaries (I’m not much of a Palkia fan but some people like him), Yanmega, Roserade, Weavile, and Gallade. Another upside is the story. While not as deep as, say, Alola’s story, or Unova’s story, it’s still pretty good. It’s got some good characters, themes, and the best champion out of the Pokémon games. It’s events are also pretty cool, even if they’re now locked behind glitches or action replay. I’d probably give it a 7.8 out of 10, too many HMs
    What are they booing you? You're right.
        Well, seems like some people have different opinions on that ;).
            Opinions yes but I have reasons
                So do I :).
                    And that’s fine! I don’t mind if someone likes it. I was just mentioning the games’ flaws so OP would know what to expect
                        The games' flaws in your opinion. And I tried to argue against your points, resulting in the realization that both of us are entitled to have our own opinions. E.g. Sword and Shield has the objective flaw that it lacks explorable areas. No one can argue against that, but with this, it comes down to own preferences.
    The snow area is NOT terrible map design. Some people are just waaaay to impatient. It is meant to slow you down, to make it hard to get through. I really like that there are areas like that in Sinnoh. You may like or dislike it, but the map design itself is NOT bad.

Same with the fog, of course it is inconvenient, but it is meant to be like that, like it or not. 

The health bars go down significantly faster in Platinum. Still not super fast, but is absolute tolerable. 

Gym puzzles are meant to be exactly that: puzzles. If you get frustrated by Pokemon gym puzzles, I feel bad for you. Or why do you dislike some of them?

Look at Galar, where the lack of HMs completely kills the exploitability and sense of adventure. I agree that it should not hinder your teambuilding and I admit that it can be annoying at times, but still it has its upsides to have them.
        Answer to first paragraph. Making you trudge through endless snow while searching for a little HM pokeball that’s hidden is not fun to do, especially if you forgot repels like I tend to do. Answer to second paragraph. Why would they purposely make part of the game even more unfun because they want fog? I’m very sure it has ended some lives in various nuzlockes. I know it caused one or more of my Pokémon to faint because the game is deciding to let itself make moves while I’m stuck missing moves. I wasn’t doing a nuzlocke but I didn’t have revives right then either. Answer to third paragraph. Yes, they do, but it’s still annoying having to wait so long when I’m healing my team after a battle. Answer to fourth paragraph. I don’t mind most gym puzzles, but some are very annoying. Maylene’s gym is one of them. Every punching bag makes a little animation that stops you if you slightly bump into one the wrong way. Not to mention, several of the gym trainers stand directly in the way of where you’re supposed to go after challenging you, forcing you to go out of the gym and do the entire thing again up to that point. It was just annoying, not hard. Kinda how I felt about a lot of things in this game. And lastly, I wouldn’t really know about Galar that much as I don’t have a Switch, but I think HMs were done much better in Alola, where you don’t have to use one of your own Pokémon to do something. But from what I’ve seen of Crown Tundra, it has decent exploration without HMs. I don’t know about the main game though, I’ve heard it’s just a straight line.
            You didn't encounter Pokemon in the Snow though, as far as I remember. Also, the snow and the fog are there to show you that nature won't make it easy for you every time, and I love that cause it adds so much authenticity to the region. It's a journey you're on, not a guided, comfortable tour through the neighborhood. The game gives you tools to e.g. deal with the fog. I know that many people dislike the tedium, but I think it's actually one of the strengths of older Pokemon generations. You had to earn your way from Mt coronet to Snowpoint City. I remember the relief I felt as a kid when I finally arrived there, it is such a memorable moment. Had the route been all cozy and easy, I would not have remembered crossing it nearly as fondly. 

Regarding the speed of animations and such...I think most people are simply too impatient. It's charming to see the small punching bad animation, although I do agree that that puzzle can be a bit frustrating if you accidentally hit one of them.

While Crown Tundra does have  basic exploration in a more complex environment...the complete base game is absolutely lacking. It literally is a straight line, with no optional areas and nothing to explore really. 

I totally agree with the Sun and Moon PokeRide, to me it's almost the perfect solution, but since the Pokemon series hadn't invented it back then, having HMs is better than not having them at all like in Galar.
                I do think the fog and snow is good from an atmosphere kind of look. From a gameplay look though, they’re just annoying. Things like the fog area and the snow area don’t make me look fondly back on them, they just made me look back on it as ‘that was annoying, probably not gonna play through it again’. And yes, I guess you could say we’re impatient. You could also say I just want to get to the next part of the story, not walk extremely slowly through a huge area of deep snow. The swampy areas are similarly annoying but I can let those slide cause they aren’t as long of routes. Chargestone cave from gen 5 was similarly frustrating but I had just forgotten repels and that was why. I’ve also never been great at mazes in Pokémon games either. But I got that feeling that you described when I finally arrived in Mistralton City. I didn’t really get that from arriving in Snowpoint- it was more of a ‘please don’t make me go through more snow to get to the next place’ kinda thing.
                    I guess we just disagree on what is fun and what isn't. Getting through snow, fog, swamp and also dark areas (caves) is definitely not smooth and easy. But I like that. I loved Chargestone cave, but I didn't find it frustrating in the slightest. And I didn't get the Snowpoint feeling at Mistralton, but rather in Icirrus, after having walked through a whole route and Twist Mountain, one of my all time favorite caves in Pokemon.

I don't think Pokemon is a story driven game in the first place. It's about a journey, an adventure. You explore a region, and on your way you get stronger, challenge the gym leaders and become the best. The evil team plot definitely adds a nice layer, but I don't think the world and exploration, and adventure should take a back seat here. So I don't mind having quite some time between story points.

As I said, we definitely don't share the same ideas of what a good Pokemon game and map should be like, and that's okay. But calling Sinnoh's map design bad is unfair. It's just that you don't like to deal with slow and inconvenient sections.
Never played it
Platinum is... not my favorite. 


In general, if you liked the 3ds era then you'll probably find sinnoh to be fairly slow and dull. It has it's upsides; the sprites are charming, the underground feature is fun, pokeball stickers were neat, and there's more postgame than a lot of recent games. But, they are definitely slow and grindy, the plot is about the level of xy, most of the areas are pretty samey, and it has the highest number of hms of any gen.


Overall, you'll probably love it or hate it, and I lean more towards the latter.
It's great that you're getting an emulator because, as you can tell from the comments, platinum is very slow. It's a very dialogue heavy game which gets annoying. The emulator will allow you to play at faster speeds so that helps. Also, i recommend downloading Renegade Platinum which is a modded version of the original with TONS of improvements such as being able to catch most of the gen 1-4 pokemon before the elite 4 therefore fixing the biggest complaint of crappy fire type availability. Plus the creator made it so all pokemon evolve without needing trading or other stuff. And they included fairy typing with updated moves sets based on Sun/Moon. So if you wanna try Platinum, this is the route I'd recommend. I too am playing the game and have found it enjoyable. I started with Blue version over 20 years ago and I'd say Platinum is probably 4th or 5th on my list. Hope this helps
Platinum has some great and creative environments and routes. Even if they are themes from past games, they are just executed in a better way
Well, it's my favorite too, and my first game was Alpha Sapphire... It just is such a cool game!

You explore a region, and on your way you get stronger, challenge the gym leaders and become the best. The evil team plot definitely adds a nice layer, but I don't think the world and exploration, and adventure should take a back seat here. So I don't mind having quite some time between story points.

As I said, we definitely don't share the same ideas of what a good Pokemon game and map should be like, and that's okay. But calling Sinnoh's map design bad is unfair. It's just that you don't like to deal with slow and inconvenient sections.
As I said, the lack of fire types is FIXED in Platinum. I think the layout is actually one of its strength. Do you prefer Galar that is literally just a straight line from start to finish?
    I prefer something like Unova or Kalos, where while the route was mostly straight forward, there was enough ability to side track and explore
It's absolutely bearable. It has never reduced my enjoyment of the game, whereas in D&P it definitely was bad.
    It kinda did for me, but I haven’t played Diamond or Pearl so I don’t know how bad it was at first
In Platinum you've got the starter, Rapidash, Houndoom, Flareon and Magmortar, so 4-5 fully evolved fire types. For comparison, in Emerald you have the starter, Camerupt, Magcargo, Torkoal and Ninetales, so 4-5 fully evolved fire types - just as much ! Yet, no one ever talks about the lack of fire types in Gen 3 \^\^.

I still think it's totally exaggerated to call Platinum THAT slow. Yes, compared to modern games, it is slower, but it's far from unbearable.
    I completely forgot about flareon

And yeah I guess it is just because I’m used to the pace of modern games, I just recently bought platinum after all
Opinions yes but I have reasons
    So do I :).
        And that’s fine! I don’t mind if someone likes it. I was just mentioning the games’ flaws so OP would know what to expect
            The games' flaws in your opinion. And I tried to argue against your points, resulting in the realization that both of us are entitled to have our own opinions. E.g. Sword and Shield has the objective flaw that it lacks explorable areas. No one can argue against that, but with this, it comes down to own preferences.
You didn't encounter Pokemon in the Snow though, as far as I remember. Also, the snow and the fog are there to show you that nature won't make it easy for you every time, and I love that cause it adds so much authenticity to the region. It's a journey you're on, not a guided, comfortable tour through the neighborhood. The game gives you tools to e.g. deal with the fog. I know that many people dislike the tedium, but I think it's actually one of the strengths of older Pokemon generations. You had to earn your way from Mt coronet to Snowpoint City. I remember the relief I felt as a kid when I finally arrived there, it is such a memorable moment. Had the route been all cozy and easy, I would not have remembered crossing it nearly as fondly. 

Regarding the speed of animations and such...I think most people are simply too impatient. It's charming to see the small punching bad animation, although I do agree that that puzzle can be a bit frustrating if you accidentally hit one of them.

While Crown Tundra does have  basic exploration in a more complex environment...the complete base game is absolutely lacking. It literally is a straight line, with no optional areas and nothing to explore really. 

I totally agree with the Sun and Moon PokeRide, to me it's almost the perfect solution, but since the Pokemon series hadn't invented it back then, having HMs is better than not having them at all like in Galar.
    I do think the fog and snow is good from an atmosphere kind of look. From a gameplay look though, they’re just annoying. Things like the fog area and the snow area don’t make me look fondly back on them, they just made me look back on it as ‘that was annoying, probably not gonna play through it again’. And yes, I guess you could say we’re impatient. You could also say I just want to get to the next part of the story, not walk extremely slowly through a huge area of deep snow. The swampy areas are similarly annoying but I can let those slide cause they aren’t as long of routes. Chargestone cave from gen 5 was similarly frustrating but I had just forgotten repels and that was why. I’ve also never been great at mazes in Pokémon games either. But I got that feeling that you described when I finally arrived in Mistralton City. I didn’t really get that from arriving in Snowpoint- it was more of a ‘please don’t make me go through more snow to get to the next place’ kinda thing.
        I guess we just disagree on what is fun and what isn't. Getting through snow, fog, swamp and also dark areas (caves) is definitely not smooth and easy. But I like that. I loved Chargestone cave, but I didn't find it frustrating in the slightest.
