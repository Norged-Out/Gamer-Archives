[[In Memory of My Real-Life Rival]]


When I was younger I was never allowed to play Pokemon, that was until some new neighbors moved in across the street and their son (who became my best friend) played it. 

He had Sapphire and a gameboy advanced, and the first time I met him he showed me everything, he had a Marshtomp as his starter who he loved. This kept on for a couple of months on and off with him showing me his progress in his game, I remember when his starter evolved into Swampert and went he beat the league, I loved watching it and couldn't wait to play it myself. 

A little bit later Diamond and Pearl came out and we begged my parents to let me get one of the games so we could play together. We did everything else together so why not this? Eventually they caved, I got pearl and he got diamond. I picked Turtwig and he picked Piplup (because he loved his water types) and we named our rivals in game after each other. We got together to battle and trade all the time, it was the most fun I've ever had with Pokemon. This continued with platinum and a bit into heart gold/soul silver but he started to move on. 

He was always more into sports than me, he played baseball, hockey, and basically any other sport you could imagine. I just played curling (with him) and started doing acting instead, so we started going down different paths. He would still play the games every now and then but I was a lot more serious with it and eventually got pretty good at the card game. The one thing that never changed was that I always named my rivals with his name. 

Even if we weren't hanging out everyday and no longer talked much, he was still one of my best friends and this help me feel connected to him. 

We graduated last year from highschool and with barely talking to each other during it, we found each other at grad to wish each other well, catch up, and take a photo. 

This week he passed away in the Humboldt bus crash in Saskatchewan. 
I have always thought of him as a brother and a bit as a role model, I've always wanted to be more like him and to see him gone hits me hard. 

Even after all of this time I still remember the first time we met and his Swampert that he loved. 
I've made a promise to always name my rival his name in the future so that even though he is gone he isn't forgotten and that I will always love him. 

I'm not sure why I made this post but I just thought it was a story I needed to share both for his memory and to talk about the feelings I'm going though. This has been a tragedy in Canada and I hope anyone else effected by the crash is doing the absolute best they can. This is just to show that they are all people and each and every person close to them is hurting right now. 

Rest easy buddy. 

Edit: Thank you all so much, this means so much to me and to his family 

Edit 2: Thank you for the Gold, I'm more stunned that this story has reached so many people, I've even connected with other people who knew my friend because of this. I will eventually be replying to every single one of you! 


My deepest condolences to you and everyone affected. I'm glad you have those memories with him to cherish. Hold onto those as much as you can.
    Thank you so much, that's what we are trying to do, celebrate life
I'm very sorry to hear that. This was a wonderful post to read, he was lucky to have you as a friend, and I'm sure you felt the same with him. Keep well OP. 
    He was amazing and I hope to be at least half as amazing to other people as he was to me
So long as you remember him he'll never truely be gone. If you ever need anything the community will always be here!
    Exactly, thank you that means a lot!
Such a touching story. May your friend rest in peace
    His story and all the stories of those affected deserve to be heard and I'm glad it received such a warm reception. 
Oh my gosh. I know people who were related to someone in that crash. It's surreal to see that bleed over into this subreddit. I'm so, so sorry. 

If I can relate to you a bit, this reminds me of my old buddy, way-way back when I was 6 years old. I wasn't allowed video games either, so my only exposure to actual Pokemon games was through huddling with my friend under a nightlight watching him play Blue. 

I moved away after I got my first GBA, and by the time I moved back he'd long left the Pokemon fanbase. We hardly ever talked again, but, I always had fond memories of him. 

Two years ago he committed suicide. It's surreal to have people influential in your life just ripped away, even if you were no longer the greatest of friends. I don't know if you've heard about him- he was a former member of the Burlington teen-tour band. 

Sorry for the tangent. TL;DR, I had a similar experience, I knew someone related to the crash, and I know you and his family will be able to find the strength to recover. 
    Thank you, this crash has affected so many people and I hope only the best to them. I also hope you're doing good as well, death is never easy to deal with and you seem to be living strong and remembering the good times, which is about all we can do. 
        Thank you for your reply. It means a lot- I haven't really thought about him in a while, and I'm happy to say that your post did remind me of the good times. Keep on pressing on, dude. :)
    Well, to you and to OP, my deepest condolences, and he sounds to me like one of my friends, and I would hate to hear that he commuted suicide... at least you have fond memories
        [deleted]
            What happens if he was from Burlington? 
                He has to work at the town coat factory. 
This bought a tear to my eye. Hope you get the strength to get through this. Losing a close one is also hard. I prey that his family can get on with this loss...
    The whole community got hit hard but we are all here for each other and seeing this support from outside is amazing too, thank you.
What is his name or nickname, not for stalker stuff but so I can honor your friend by naming a rival or Pokemon for him. Feel free to PM me a name I can use in his honor if you don't want to post it here. 
    His name was Parker and that is amazingly sweet, thank you
        To be honest, the Diamond/Pearl rival seems like a such a big Parker. I hope we get to name our rivals again in the remakes, whenever that may be.
        I will name my Swampert and all my water starters in pokemon go parker now, if I knew how to send screen shots on mobile I would, but take my word for it they will all be changed tonight. I'll also name all my grass starters after you,  Maddog or mastaman? Inbox me if you have a different  nickname in mind
            Maddog would be just perfect haha, and thank you thats crazy I still can't believe some of this support
        You are welcome. I will help Parker to continue to live on.
        So #Parkermon
        Coincidentally about to play through Platinum. Will also name him Parker :) he definitely looks like a Parker.
        In memoriam, I will be doing this aswell. I had a similar situation a few years back, and I've named my starter after my friend Temple (last name, we were in JROTC together) since SS.

Parker is my rival's new name sir, and god bless.
    Well shit, OP's friend [was believed to be alive until this morning](https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/8ayfqg/body_in_humboldt_bus_crash_misidentified_xavier/) when the person they thought was him woke up and said his name was Xavier.

[And apparently Parker's parents were in the room when it happened](http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/xavier-labelle-and-parker-tobin-ron-maclean-on-the-tragic-mix-up-of-the-two-humboldt-players/), This is getting more fucked up by the day.
        Yeah my family was in contact with them and hearing about that was heart breaking. 
    This is a great idea. 
    Same. Whichever game I start anew next, I’ll make sure to incorporate a meaningful name into it for him and you. Is there a specific name you’d prefer us to use? Your friendship can easily spread into thousands of Pokémon adventures this way.
    Yeah I was thinking of restarting my alpha sapphire so that would be fitting to name him as my rival. 
    Et moi
I'm sorry for your loss, you two had a beautiful friendship 
    He's the type of friend everyone deserves I hope you have someone in your life like that and cherish them when you can.
Dang... I have a friend just like that from my youth and your  post made me realize how fortunate I am to have him around still. Much love to you, and I'm deeply sorry for your loss <3 
    I'm so glad you have someone like that, if you haven't talked to them in a while you should think about sending them a message and just catching up. Nothing lets us appreciate life more than the loss of it.
    Can anyone tell me what the deleted comment said
        It was a “dang” bot comment. Just insensitive for the situation
        probably something inappropriate

Sending positive vibes from Toronto. It is all over the news and is very, very tragic. Seems like a great small town (less than 10k population). 

People at work have been talking about it all day and some of the ladies are very distraught given their young ones are hockey players and constantly on a bus driving to a game somewhere.  
    I don't know the town personally but I've heard nothing but great things. Small town hockey embodies what Canada is and even though I have never played myself, that sense of community is so important and I'm glad that Canadians and beyond can all come together for that.
This is a true tragedy. My mother’s cousin was thought to have survived the crash, albeit with major injuries, but when the person woke up in his hospital bed and was addressed by the cousin’s name, he responded “That’s not me”. Turns out my mother’s cousin did die in the crash, the reason for the confusion was because they had all dyed their hair blonde. Hope you get through it, great post.
    Wasn't Parker the guy who was thought to have survived, but when the guy woke up he said, "I'm Xavier", so that means you and OP are talking about the same guy! Parker is OPs friend.
        Whoa. That’s insane! r/nevertellmetheodds
            Yep, the world is a small place. Surprised that OP hasn't responded. You guys could remember him together. /u/MaddogMastaMan

I love how a Pokemon subreddit bring us altogether, from mourning a loved one, to helping people retrieve their lost Pokemon games/merchandise.
                Actually I didn’t really know him all that well. Sorry to burst your bubble of positivity :(
                    oh, its aight
                I had sent him a message, I just didn't want to say last name in public. But yeah it is a crazy small world
                    For sure dude.
I’m incredibly sorry for your loss, my thoughts go to you and everyone affected by this tragedy. But, this was such a lovely post and it’s a wonderful way to honour your friend!
    Thank you, this crash hurt far and wide and I hope the best to everyone related to it. 
Oh man.. I watched the livestreamed services held last night and it was really hard to swallow. My greatest condolences to you and everyone else affected by this disaster. Its reach to even this community shows how every incident is massive in some way. I hope we can all come together and help you through these tough times.

All the best to you dude, he will always be with you no matter what.
    In Canada something like this is so uncommon so when it does happen it hurts bad, seeing the support even beyond is what really helps us pull through.
this is the most beautiful thing i've read in a very long time. i'm just speechless.
    I'm glad that his story can touch people all over
        I'm speechless too...
As a fellow Canadian who likes sports (and who's favourite Pokemon is Mudkip), this hurts to read.

Personally I cannot even imagine how would I cope if one of my childhood friends who played pokemon games with me, just gone like this. I browse r/hockey rather frequently, and I just don't even have the courage to comment on the subject. They're all so young, even a little younger than me and it's gotta be one of the worst feelings in the world to see promising young lads just have their life cut short, so abruptly like that. 

It's weird, I haven't played Pokemon games since ...4 years ago, and I only came across this sub by coincidence (misclick) and this is the top voted post. I guess we're all connected in some way, the world truly is a small place.

Stay strong brother.
            I don't know anyone here that hasn't felt this a great deal, and that is a crazy coincidence. The needless loss of life through chance is saddening but all we can do is remember them and move on stronger and live for them. 
May Arceus bring him home safely
That is awful news, I'm really sorry to hear it.

I think this is a nice thing to do, I'm sure he would appreciate it :)
    He would have got at least a good chuckle out of it for sure! Haha
Resonating post, life is a crazy thing. Rest in paradise 
    Crazy indeed, but we can only keep looking up and remember the good times.
I feel so sorry for you, you must have felt so sad when you heard the news. Make sure you never forget those precious memories of you, your rival and his Swampert. It's nice to see how a simple franchise can bring two people together so well. My deepest condolences to everyone involved, from a young England citizen.
    Its been a roller coaster, he was misidentified and we were told he was in the hospital until they checked the dental records and we found out the truth. Swampert will always have a special place because of him.
I’m sorry for your loss. I was watching the press conference for that this morning. I can’t recall who said this but it goes something along the lines of “people die twice once when they stop breathing and again when their name stops getting mentioned” keep him in your memories. 
    That's my exact thoughts, it may just be a reddit post but it helps his memory to live on
        to add on, when youre in a more emotionally stable place, creating a journal of memories helps, even if your memory degrades you can look at the whole of your relationship, the good, the growing up together, graduation meetups, even little fights are still memories that create a whole image of a beautiful person
sending love and good vibes form California <3 
    Thank you, its wild to see how far this has traveled, it means a lot
Oh man I wish the best for you 
    Thank you, and I wish the best to the others affected, together we can get through this
Wow, sorry for your loss man,. Beautiful way to remember your friend though. 
    Its a small part of the relationship between us but still a special one
I remember my best friend as a kid and how we used to play Pokemon together, making up our own Dex and creating our own fantasy pokemon universe, making each other our rivals and all the stuff kids do like OP and his friend.

We fell out as teenagers over a girl and while we did make up we've barely spoken since. And reading this post has really shaken me

I want to contact him, maybe meet and catch up on the last few years and who knows if he'll even be able to, but this post has inspired me to get off my arse and reach out.

Thank you OP.
    Do it man, if you don't you may regret not doing so.
    I'm so happy, I've had a lot of friends that I've falling outs with, but that never means it's irrepairable. Reach out and celebrate your friendship and appreciate that your both alive to do so. Take care
God damn man.  This hit me real hard in the feels.  I have a similar story, but even though he hasn't passed, my Rival and I don't talk much anymore either.  Going on 12 years we've been best friends.  I'm going to reach out to him today.  Hang in there man.
    I'm so glad you have someone like that and please do reach out. Nothing remind us about the value of life than the loss of it, if you can value life through my experiences and not have to lose anyone close to you then that is even better. 
Americans give Canadians a lot of crap, but in reality you're our brothers and we really do care about you.
    Thank you for that, we share a border so we are kinda stuck, might as well support each other when we can! 
Lots of love.
    Same to you, everyone can use more love
As soon as you said he played hockey I knew what was coming. Such a tragic incident.
    Yeah the accident was tragic and affected so many people, I've been seeing too many all too similar stories recently too.
        Similar to OP's or similar to the accident?
            Similar stories about those involved in the accident 
        I know so many people that were personally affected by the crash, it breaks my heart.
    I don’t get it.
        What do you mean you don't get it? Read his post, it's pretty obvious..
            No, I mean I don’t quite understand your comment.
                OP said his friend played hockey, title said "in memory", put two and two together man.
                    Now I get it, thanks for clarifying!
Sorry for your loss ❤️ and also be thankful for Nintendo and game freak for bringing together two people 
    If he didn't have that gameboy when I met him who knows how it would have played out different
        Exactly. Look at my username lol I love the gameboy so much and it has changed my life, and yours, forever
Next time I run Black, I'll ring the bell at the Celestial Tower for your friend. I'm so sorry for your loss.
    You just reminded me to do the same thing, that's always been a heavy place and now it'll mean even more, thank you
    Thank you for reminding me of the Celestial Tower Bell. I'm running Black aswell, so I guess i'll ring the bell for him too.
    If only that bell could bring back people, like the bell of awakening from Dark Souls 3. Losing someone you had a deep bond with is truly devastating.
So very sorry for your loss. Sending good vibes your way!
    Thank you, that means a lot
That’s really nice. I’m sorry about him. 
    Don't be too sorry, instead celebrate and enjoy the people around you while you have them
That's a nice tribute to your friend. I'm sorry for your loss.
    Its not much but its means a lot and that's what really matters
        Hey it has meaning to you, and that's what really matters.
What's his name? I want to name my Swampert after him. 
    Parker, I'm sure he'd love it
[deleted]
    I'm so happy for you and Tyler, I hope you still talk and if you don't maybe think of sending a message and catching up. Appreciate life while its here! 
I'm not very religious, but I really hope there is an afterlife, so you both can meet again, and have a few more battles.
    posts like these make me hope that when you die you can either choose to cease to exist or be reincarnated.
I had a friend just like this growing up.  We were neighbors too and we started way back with OG red version on huge gameboys.  He stopped playing after gold version but it was so much fun playing together.  Hell it was so cool as a kid during that time.  I remember sitting at a yardsale with a link cable trading pokemon with kids who came by with their parents.

We grew apart and he moved away.  Im 30 now and just bought a house in another town.  Crazy shit is he is my neighbor again.  We dont really talk now but its cool we ended up next to each other after 15 odd years.
    That's absolutely wild! Hey, even if you don't talk you both have those memories and that's what matters
Really sorry to hear this. One thing that helped me was naming a Pokemon in their honor. If you're willing to spend more time on it, you can even aim for a Nature and Characteristic that suit their personality. May or may not be something you'd like to do, but I feel like it helps me.

Do you still have that copy of Sapphire with the same save file?
\*hug for OP*
I'm in Britain (with love, from England) so although we acknowledge this crash is terrible, it's not really... quite as thought about as it should be. It doesn't affect us, so we get on with our lives (in no way am I saying that's right). This must be really hard for you.
Without comparing my situation to yours in ANY WAY WHATSOEVER, I understand what it feels like to still feel closely attached to a person you've drifted apart from, or even still get along well with but don't see so much anymore. Personally, as not so much of a hockey fan (whenever I play it people just whack me in the shins), I guess I didn't really stop to think about how many people this would affect until I read this post. My condolences, mate.
But, you MIGHT not want to play X, Y, Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun or Ultra Moon: I've played them all and as far as I can remember, you can't name the rival in them. Maybe... maybe instead, you could always have a Swampert in your party named after your late friend..? (I know now I'm going to be breeding to get the perfect one.) I hope you read this and that it helps to know that, even if it sounds weird coming from a stranger, I respect your situation, as do the so many others who have also responded. Always cherish those memories of him (and his Pokemon!) and he will never truly leave his world.
Oh damn that went in a different direction than I expected. I'm sorry for your loss.
I heard your friend likes mudkips
    He loved that meme when it started haha! 
I was at the Devils-Capitals game, where they did a moment of silence for all of the victims. Thats crazy that the effect of the tragedy has spread even here, the most unlikely place (imo) for it. I am sorry for your loss, and thats crazy. Reading this gave me flash backs to my childhood, where I had 3 or 4 friends obsessively playing the games alongside me. We would talk about it in school and couldn't wait to get together to play. Losing someone sucks, but I'm intrigued by the connection you guys established with Pokemon.
    It reaches much further than anyone would imagine. I hope you still talk to them and if not maybe think of reaching out and catching up, cherish the friendships you have, live life you know? 
That was a very touching story. I am so sorry for the loss of your friend. All of Canada is mourning along side you brother.

Sorry for your loss dude. Fuck, when did the room get so blurry? 
    I know I've been asking myself the same question all day haha
Fuck bud. Im sorry. 

My heart goes out to you and those lost. 


    Thank you, this support is amazing and does really help those affected
Aww this touched my heart in a next level , losing a best friend, nostalgic Pokemon way all wrapped together in one, what an explosion of emotions, thanks for sharing your sweet story, he might want you to find your next rival eventually , the SO rival, keep your chin up lad ;)
    Idk if you believe in tattoos but swampert is looking pretty prime
        I was thinking the same thing, who knows it might happen
    He'll always be a part of me but I will keep moving on, its what he would have wanted and why not live my life to its fullest while I'm still here!
        Good for you man! Wise words, I'm sure this is what he would have wanted <3
Your post has made me feel a great deal of feels. Again, really sorry for this loss. 
    Seeing this reach has been amazing and really shows how supportive this community is
        Definitely :) hope you enjoy my gift of gold btw
I'm so sorry for your loss...please tell me you still have those games with the save files you used to play with him! Those should be kept safe and treasured forever.
    Still have my first ever starter up with me in gen 7!
Sending love from BC <3
I’m so sorry for your loss. I’m replaying OR very soon and I’m sure Parker the Swampert will make a great friend. 
My condolences, OP. I wish you, your friend’s family, and all the other friends and family affected by this event the best.
Wow. I don't know what hit me harder, losing a wonderful hockey team to a tragic occurrence, or learning more about them after the fact and how they impacted their community.

My condolences.
    It's tough when it's a number that you know affects so many people but when you start hearing about who they were it gets way harder. 
Im so sorry for your loss, im from ontario and when my girlfriend told me what happened my heart hurt for all the people experiencing loss from this tragedy. I was lucky that my brothers made it out of Fort McMurray I have never been any closer to the same. So sorry for your loss. He will live on always in Pokemon World!
So sorry about your friend. Being a hockey player myself i couldn’t believe it when I read the report. I cannot imagine what everyone is going through and I’m so sorry.  As a member of the hockey community worldwide I left a stick outside for one of them down here in Connecticut once I saw people up in Canada were doing the same. My condolences to you and everyone affected. 
    Thank you, even a small gesture like that so far away still means a lot
I did not read the post title before reading this. Complete plot twist if you read it that way. My condolences by the way
My deepest condolences for your loss. I lost my best friend 7 years ago and I still have trouble dealing with it. It's beautiful that you have the kind of bond you do that started with something as awesome as Pokémon. 
I have fond memories of playing Pokémon with my friend too, I can't imagine what you're going through right now. 
Bless you. This is a sweet tribute. I am so sorry about your friend.
My heart goes out to you. This was a touching story, and I hope your buddy is at peace.
I now know what people mean by feeling your heart drop. I am so, so sorry for your loss.
Me and my best friend grew up together, playing Pokemon together, naming our rivals after each other and always getting the opposite game than eachother. i couldn't imagine losing him. My Sincerest apologies to you.
    Remember to let him know how much he means to you every now and then. It may seem dumb but it'll be worth it in the end
Deepest condolences to you and everyone affected, man. This was a heart breaker. ;(
I wish only the best to you and your friends family. May his memory live on forever, and his pokemon too.
Putting stories to the faces we see on the TV helps us realize the weight of the loss. I’m so sorry. Thank you for sharing. 
I'm so sorry for your loss! Hope he's soul rests in peace
Condolences to you and the family, sending good vibes from Italy 🇮🇹 
Condolences :(( 
Maaan. That sucks. 
The Humboldt crash was so surreal I can't stop thinking about how in a different life that could have been my brother or one of my cousins. My heart goes out to you. Keep strong and train on my friend.
I'm so sorry to hear that. Cheer up.
 My sincere condolences. I pray that you and everyone else affected will be okay. 
I'm sorry man I hope you cherish those memories forever and know he did too
Myself about about 300 other union boilermakers and pipefitters had a stand down while on shift for those lost on the bus. We all took our hard hats off and sent out our prayers. Heart goes out to all those involved.
[deleted]
    Me too! What a great idea!
Holy shit man i give my utmost condolences. I completely understand that childhood joy of playing Pokémon with your best friend and had a similar experience as you with diamond and pearl with my friends as I am only a few years younger. Again I give my condolences and wish you the best
This story made me cry in the break room at work in front of my coworkers. I never had a good nickname for Swampert, so I guess mine will be named Parker from now on. 
Winnipeger here, hoping and wishing all of you in Humboldt the best in life after what happened. May your friend rest in peace 
This hit me in places that I never thought would be possible. 

While growing up I had a friend who ended up giving me his copy of Pokemon heart gold because he just simply knew that I loved generation two of Pokemon. He just sort of knew that if he gave me the game, that I would spend a ton of time playing through it, and that the game would get a ton of love. In honor of that, I named my Cyndaquill, Slade, as that was his lame as hell bboy name at the time. Gradually with time we stopped kind of talking to each other as our paths kind of moved away from each other. And the last news I heard of him was, that he got into an accident and passed away. I won't lie, it fucked me up when I opened my heart gold to see Slade the Tyflosion there. While I'm okay now, the story you wrote here definelty had me shook for a second, because I've been there before. 

My condolences to you and his family, and everyone affected. If you ever need anyone to talk to, my DMs are always open. 
    That is a beautiful and heart breaking story, I hope you cherish the memories with him and live your life the best you can in his honour. Lots of love from one friend to another. 
I'm so sorry man, that was an amazing and heartbreaking story, thanks for sharing. I hope your friend sees this, wherever he is now. 
Being a Pokemon fan myself, i never did get to play Pokemon game on gameboys because family couldn't afford it, and I only played it through emulators. My heart was warmed to read your story, and it crushed when saw that your friend passed away.

It must have been really hard for you, I hope you will be able to be strong.

My condolences to you and his family, may his soul rest in peace. 
This hit me man!
Hope all gets well for his family and yourself as well. 
My deepest apologies to you. your friends family. and everyone involved in that crash. Just remember he will always be alive within you. in your heart. May your friend rest in peace.
Stick taps for you, OP. _/
I always name my rival with my best friend's as well. I don't think I can even imagine how this would feel if he too passes away. My deepest condolences to you and his family. 
    Just remember to tell him how much he means sometime, it may seem dumb but you never know when the last time you can will be
This made me tear up and it hits close to home. My real life rival always picked water types too and I also picked grass. Condolences, Brother. 
i'm sorry to hear about your loss man. As long as you have something to remember him by, he'll never be forgotten.
I'm sorry for your loss. My best wishes to you and everyone that this has impacted in their lives. Stay strong OP.
My deepest condolences on your lost and to all their families. You both were very lucky to have each other as friends and buddies. As we grow old, life takes us through different paths and sometimes it is almost impossible to understand why young people who are full of life and dreams have to go so soon. Your post was wonderful and an original way to pay tribute to your best friend. Thanks so much for sharing it with us.
This really hit me hard once I read further and realized what happened. I am so sorry for your loss and send you my best wishes. May your friend, his teammates and the victims rest in peace. As a Canadian, this does hit close to home and my school is trying to do something to help. 
There’s not much I can really say that hasn’t been said more eloquently by others. But we’re here for you. 
Beautiful.
I know I’m late, but my condolences my friend. As hard as this time is, the fact that you have those memories to remember him by is so special, and they’re exclusive to you. Just remember that, that those memories you shared were between the two of you and only you. Peace brother :’)
Damn dude, my condolences. He’ll live on with you. Remember that 
    Live on in the good times and great memories, thank you
That's really sad even for me and I'm not usually too emotional. R.i.p
    Neither was he but if he saw he was able to get a couple tears he'd be having a great laugh! I'm glad it resonated with you, thank you
I'm wondering.. where are my pokemon friends just now? We're brazilian, it's a fucking big country (just like USA and Canada). We went to total different places. If one of us (we were 5, I still have connection with just 1 of them, because he is still living in our hometown) die, the others will just don't know.. maybe some days or weeks later, or maybe never

I still remember the pokemon we liked the most (we played together the 3 first generations before the group start to take different paths) 

the fat guy: alakazam, jolten, politoed, venusaur
the beautiful: espeon, umbreon, dragonite, blastoise
the athletic: tyranitar, venusaur, hitmonlee, vaporeon
the weirdo: blissey, seviper, castform, scizor
me, the sensible: sandslash, xatu, jumpluff, raichu

me and the athletic reached some good ranks (a stable top 300 in the most competitive server) playing the old Pokemon Netbattle at 4th generation, but university took our time, and we just had to stop. There is a photo in my facebook when we last met, the 5 together. It was 6 years ago, I was breaking up of my first relationship, and we drunk a lot. Fun night
    That's so good that you have those memories! I hope you still talk to your one friend every now and then. I'm sure even those that moved away cherish those memories too!
Even though I never knew any of those boys, it still hurts. As an Edmontonian, that from which some of those boys were from, including the surrounding areas, it really does hurt. Even if you're like me and only ever played rec leagues or with friends, it really hits close to home.

My deepest condolences towards you and the families involved.
    Also being from Alberta it didn't hit me as hard as some people in Sask. that lost so many friends, but the one I did lose was one hell of a guy.
Awesome to hear how both of you stayed friends with your lives moving on. I played hockey and Pokémon my whole life, still do at 23. I watched the vigil from last night and it was great to see the community come together and celebrate a group of guys. 

Alberta is with you my friend.

Sidenote, a lot of us left out sticks outside for the guys, I hung up the last jersey I wore for Minor Hockey outside my house. It'll stay there for a while.
    Thank you, I'm from Alberta too but sadly not at home so I couldn't leave my stick out. I'm hoping to be able to go back home for his vigil but with all the craziness of uni its a tough juggling act
I think you articulated something very poignant about Pokemon and gaming in general. Many of us grew up with this series, many of us made friends with the help of these games. Our best memories of playing Pokemon arent necessarily about finishing the elite four or catching a shiny, its more about sharing the experience with others and enjoying the competition of it. So long as you remember those experiences and uphold your tradition, you are honoring his memory in the best way possible. Games are meant to be enjoyed together, and they are ultimately so much more rewarding that way too.  
    Exactly, its about trading and interactions as much as it is about battles
Would you like someone to talk to? If there's anything we can do, let us know...
    Thank you, Ive had unbelievable support and the only thing I could hope for you to do is to cherish your friends while they are around.
        Heh, would if I had those :P

seriously, though, please let me know if you need someone to reach out to. I have some experience with the mental health field. At the very least, I can be an ear for you to speak to
Who's cuttin' Onions??? 

Seriously OP, my condolences
    I don't know but who ever it is has been following me around all day! Haha
        Me too, bro, me too. Sucks doesn't it?
Thanks for sharing your story, it was beautiful.
    Sharing the memories are all we can do at this point to celebrate, I'm glad you enjoyed reading it, it means a lot
Sorry for your loss, that's the best kind of friendship and you are lucky to have had that friendship.
    It really is, I hope you have a friendship that you can say that about too!
Damn... After all of the feels from the Sedins retiring and the crash... this is really sad. Hang in there, dude, and thanks for sharing your story. Cherish those memories forever, and he will live on as your rival, always pushing you to better yourself and your Pokemon partners!! 
    Exactly, I have to do my best now because I know that's what he would have wanted
I am so sorry for your loss. My inbox is always open if you want to talk.
    Thank you, the support has been amazing
I'm sorry for your loss. :( This is a really inspiring story. I remember having one friend who was into Pokémon for a little while until he got into sports, too. 
    We all go our own ways but we still deep down are friends 
I'm so sorry to hear about your loss. Prayers from Colorado 
    Thank you, he grew up close to the Rockies so I'm happy to see the American side showing support too.
I’m so sorry for your loss. 
    Thank you, celebrate his story though so he can live on
        I found your comment on his name, if I can find the games in which we can name our rival I’ll name my rival in honor of him. 
Oh my god I am so sorry. I was devastated when I learned the news of the crash. This made my heart sink. Much love from Montreal. May he rest in peace.
    It hit all of Canada really hard but I'm glad we are all here to come together in these peoples time of need.

I’m very sorry to hear about this circumstance. He didn’t deserve for this to happen to him, and you have my condolences for what happened.

I’m glad that you were able to appreciate such special moments with him though.
    No one deserves something like this its just all chance so at least he lived a great life and I have great memories with him to look back on
This has been such a tragedy for our country.  It sounds like all these guys were stand up dudes, I hope you find solace in knowing that you meant a lot to him too and that I’m sure he cherished the memories you both shared.  Having someone like yourself be so welcoming in a new neighbourhood is always a great thing, especially during that age in a child’s life. 
    Catching up with him when we graduated was a blast and really opened my eyes to the love that was still there even after all those years. I always try to be as friendly as possible because you never know who you will have these memories with, and whats more Canadian than being friendly eh!
Be it a terrible accident, suicide, medical issues, whatever, posts like this continue to remind me that no one is truly alone in this world. If someone passes away, there's always Someone who will remember them, even if it's someone you'd never expect. I'm sorry for your loss, thank you for writing this, and I'm glad it's gotten a bit of attention so your friend will be remembered by even more people.
    Exactly, even if the world seems cold there is always those who care
        just a random question did your friend play oras with you?
I'm surprised it wasn't asked, but why weren't you allowed to play Pokemon as a young child?
    It was just a dumb rule from my parents, weren't huge into anime and all that stuff and Pokemon was the prime focus of that for my age. But when they saw it made me happy and I was able to bond with people over it, they realized it was a dumb rule
If it were me I would ask the family if I could transfer that Swampert up to Gen VII as an eternal memory. 

I am very sorry for your loss.
    Don't do this OP. Let the family mourn their loved one. If your friend moved away from Pokemon, then the game (if he still has it) is probably not easily accessible for you to find.
        Sorry, I did not mean right away. Obviously doing it anywhere near the time would be quite inappropriate.
        Why not? If it helps OP to respect his lost friend and it doesn't hurt anyone, there is absolutely NO reason to not.
            It can hurt the family if they are trying to mourn. It's disrespectful to ask now. 
I'm assuming your buddy was not the one that was misidentified and still alive. Either way, thanks for sharing your story, and, assumption holding true, I hope you can keep his spirit alive within you throughout all of your shared passions.
    The one who was misidentified was thought to be my mother’s cousin. Turns out it was a different person :(
        Sorry to hear it.
            We’re distant relatives, we barely knew him. I feel bad for his close friends and family.
    No sadly he was the one they thought was still alive, but he will live on in the great times we had
        God, that's even worse. His family, you, to be given false hope... you're holding up remarkably well. I'm glad that sharing the story is helping you. I know what it's like to have someone suddenly ripped from your life.
        That's even worse than finding out the truth straightaway. I feel your pain.
Sending positive vibes from Ottawa! Sorry to hear about your friend, but always hold onto those memories, and let them live on inside of you forever. Cherish the good moments, we are all here for you!
    Just like you said, cherish the good, instead of obsessing over his death we are all trying more to celebrate the life he had and the life we all have because of him
[deleted]
    It's hit everyone in Alberta and Saskatchewan in one way or another and I'm glad everyone is still holding strong. I hope you cherish those memories you had and maybe if you get the chance you should send him a message and catch up if you can.
Thank you for sharing this memory of him. I hope you're able to look back and smile at all the good times you two had. 
    That's exactly my I made this and how I've been holding up
Wow you just made me cry a little and usually I don't get very emotional, may he rest in peace
    I'm glad his story has touched you, he'd get a good laugh of a stranger crying over him haha! Thank you
        Then you should know it's not just the one stranger who cried
This was such a beautiful story with a surprising ending that I was not expecting. I am so sorry for your loss but it sounds like y'all had a beautiful, pure friendship that will last in memory, and your Pokemon rivals, for many years to come <3
Thank you for sharing such a lovely memory! 
    I'm glad people get to hear about how great of a person he was
        Me too! It's still an awful tragedy, but you shared a little light in the dark. Thank you again. 
I'm so sorry, you're in my thoughts along with anyone affected by this horrible tragedy.
    It has hurt so many people and I only hope the best for all of them, thank you
        I hope you are ok also. 
This is beautiful... 
Sorry for your loss.
I am so sorry. This is a beautiful story.
I'm so sorry about your loss. My deepest sympathies. 
my deepest condolences, a truly touching story.

You have my condolences my friend. May he rest in peace.
That's really sad. I hope it gets easier.
    Oh it will, it sucks now but as long as we can focus on the good the bad won't seem so bad one day
        Exactly! I hope his family knows that too. It can be hard to lose someone you're close to.
Welp, that was too much feels for me for one day :(


My condolences on the loss of your friend. Continue to play in memory of your buddy! Cherish those good times! 
    I will never forget them, thank you
Great story. Very sorry. 
I never imagined myself crying at a Reddit post.
    Well I never thought I'd cry while writing one haha!
    Mainly because the story until the high school part is relatable an something almost equal has happened to me.
        It happens, I hope you cherish the memories you have
Whose cutting unions?

My condolences. I have no idea what it must feel like. I wish you the best of luck.
Thank you so much for sharing your story and I'm deeply sorry for your loss.
Yeah I heard about that, can't imagine the grieve & heartbreak after such a tragedy. You guys shared something truly special! I hope you find peace along with the families affected. Thank you for sharing what a great individual your friend was with us!
    It has been a wild ride for everyone and knowing people who never would have met him get to see the kind of person makes it just a little bit easier
I am so sorry. I went through something a bit similar several years ago. My close childhood friend and I loved Pokemon, but grew apart once we went to different high schools. He then died the first year of college. It is a terrible experience to go through, and I am sorry you (and others) have to experience this.

Please do continue to honor the friendship you had. And if you are ever hesitant to reach out to his family, please do! I am sure they will appreciate it. For everyone else, please enjoy time with your close friends and family. These situations are always a grim reminder that life can end too quickly.
    I am so sorry for you too, losing a friend, especially one you've had for a long time, is never easy. I will cherish the times and I hope you do the same with your friend 
I’m tearing up right now, your tribute to him was so beautiful and I’m sure your guys’ friendship was even greater. It’s amazing that you two got to experience this life, especially with Pokemon, together, and happily so. Rest in peace to your friend and warm thoughts to his family and you. <3 
    Oh man the amount of good memories I have are endless this one just happened to stick out and I thought it would be good to share, thank you 
        Anytime, we’re here to support you ! His memory will live on.
Don’t cry


Trying not to cry.


Cries a lot. 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
    My thought process today haha!
    I'm glad I'm not the only one *laughs while crying*
Such a tragedy, my condolences.  Went to an AHL Cleveland Monsters game last night and before the anthem, we had a moment of silence.  Both teams alternating in a big circle on the ice.  Wish you and his family well.
    The crash affected people far and wide and its amazing to see the support coming from even further than I could have ever imagined
This is tough, man. Hits way too close to home. Thanks for sharing your story.

Hope you're holding up alright.
    I'll be just fine I am now only hoping the best for all the others affected, they are all amazingly strong
Sorry for your loss. Thanks for sharing your story. Pokemon was a huge part of my childhood too. Always worthwhile reading about how it affected other people.
    It's amazing how something so simple can effect someone so much
I'm so sorry for your loss. :(
I’m so sorry for your loss, as a die hard hockey fan I was in complete shock when I heard what had happened in Humboldt. I’m happy to hear that you have found a way to honor your friend. These young men will never be forgotten and may they Rest In Peace. 
    As someone who doesn't even play hockey it still hurt even before I found out my friend was involved. Its something so intrinsically Canadian that the ripples reach far and wide
I am sorry to hear this news, I do wish the best by you and everyone affected by this unfortunate event. I can sadly say, that I can relate to this to a certain extent. When I was young, around 12, I had a friend named Paulo. He was without question my closest friend, and maybe even my only friend at the time. We both shared a deep love for pokemon, and would play together, and collect cards, and discuss the game ect. One day after school, we decided that we would design and draw our own pokemon, it was a great deal of fun. Little did I know it would be the last time I'd see him, as he was later struck by a car on his walk home with his mother and put into critical condition. He was in a coma for months, and everyday I would hope and pray that I would get a call saying he would be fine,and I'd be able to see him again. That day never came. I have a little box of pokemon cards, drawings we made together and pictures of him so I never forget how much he influenced my love for this game. Never forget your friend, he is truly special. 
    I'm so sorry for your loss and it is touching to see how you've kept those memories close. Life is crazy fragile and nothing reminds us to cherish it more than when it is lost. Best to you
        Thank you so much.
Sending love from North bay ontario❤❤❤
    This is something that has effected so many Canadians and seeing support from out East is amazing, thank you
        I'm here for you if you need someone
        And England!
I can't even read these replies, i'm tearing up again. This has been a hard week for us in the hockey community.  
Love from a Winnipeg Jets fan.
    Hockey and beyond, home town hockey is so fundamental to Canada that its affected so many, thank you
That story sounds insanely familiar dude. Been playing the old Diamond recently again now, thinking about those memories.  

I’m sorry you lost your friend.
    I'm glad you have those memories cherish them and those you shared them with while you can
Rest in peace. 💜
My cousin and I had such a close bond we 
corrected anyone that called us friends. He was allowed to have gameboys and a DS lite and got Diamond and we'd take turns (I wouldn't save) which is what finally convinced my parents to get it so we could play. HGSS came out a the best time because that's when we loved it the most. He doesn't play Pokémon now, thought we're still close. Throughout childhood we competed against each other and it helped us grow. We never named our rivals after each other but we always played together. This story brings me so many memories and happiness of that era in my life.

Thank you for sharing your story, and I think it's awesome for the kid in you to honor him in this way. Keep ya head up, remember the good times.
    What are we if not big kids that have responsibilities now haha. I'm glad you have those memories and cherish them like you should
        I agree 1000%. Too bad we can't be little forever
I keep hearing the Blue theme in my head. Remember, your friend may be gone, but he has a kickass theme to go with em.
That's beautiful dude... 
I hope you read this. I feel so sorry for you dude. I KNOW YOUR PAIN TOO DAMN WELL. I graduated just last year as well with friends I could call rivals myself. Although i didnt have them as definitive best friends of mine I just lost not one but two of them due to different circumstances just this past November. I felt so bad and couldn't believe this whole experience was real. They had their whole lives ahead of them. My advice to you is to keep going harder. Keep striving further. Its what your best friend would've wanted for you. He will always be by your side despite you not being able to see him
    I wish only the best to you, a few people from my grad class have died but this one hit the closest. Of course, he wouldn't have wanted it any other way
Why am I crying
So sorry about your friend. But Thank you for sharing this beautiful life story ! As a Canadian myself I really think this tragedy has shook the whole country and I send my thoughts and prayers to you and everybody who was directly affected. 
    It has and it is amazing to see Canadians and beyond unite to remember these great people
I'm a Canadian and I'm very sorry to hear about this loss.
(I have the same feeling to everyone who's also involved in this incident.)
Wow that hit me hard.
Was not expecting that.
A great pokemon story that I was enjoying, then, feels. I'm so sorry.
Sorry to hear this I hope he stays with you in your heart and you have a peaceful grieving period. 

After reading this I imagine him and swampert kicking ass and taking names 
    They sure kicked my ass to start with haha! Thank you
That story brings a tear to my eye and if that happened to me and my friend i would be crying 😢
    Oh trust me I have been haha!
Sorry to hear. I have a friend similar to the one you lost. I’m sorry. Maybe you can ask his parents if you can trade his swampert and you can keep it in his honor. Better than his Pokémon just sitting there forever :( 
I'm sure he's looking on, smiling at you for what you've done.
You have my condolences :(
That was a great story bro sorry for loss and hope the province can get pass and heal from this incident
Wow, this story took a turn I was not expecting. It's so crazy how quick life can change. Hope your doing well OP. Your friend is in a better place.
    Life is pretty wild and you never know when something like this will happen so just remember to cherish those close to you while you can
        Im glad you know that. The sooner you realize that all things in life are only temporary, the sooner you can not forget and move on but be at peace with accepting how fleeting life is. It's important to appreciate what you currently have because it will eventually be gone. You should also be excited for the new things, events and people that are soon to come in the future.
I'm very sorry for your loss, but I am glad that you have memories of him, and are continuing to honour his memory. My deepest condolences.
Wife told me it was going around social media to place hockey sticks at your front door in remembrance.  Doesn’t seem like much and wish I could do more, but I send my deepest sympathies to you and for all who are suffering from this tragedy.  Two goalie sticks are outside our door.   My thoughts are with you guys...
    That's been the big thing that I haven't been able to take part in sadly because I am away at uni. Thank you for that gesture no matter how small it still counts (funny thing too is that he was the goalie, what are the odds!)
I’m so sorry for your loss, man 
I went to school with one of the guys who passed away as well. Thoughts with you. Its been a rough couple days. But seeing all the support from everyone is heartwarming. 
This story is touching in a way I've never really felt before. I came into a love of Pokemon games in a very similar way, just a generation earlier. The feelings of nostalgia this brings up  for me are so bittersweet, and I'm sure many other people reading this feel the same way. You have my deepest sympathies for your loss, and I'm sure your rival would be touched to know he touched your life this way. 
    It's a feeling many can empathize with and I'm glad so many people can share the good times we had
I wasn’t planning on crying tonight. My thoughts are with you and his family. 
Oh, I'm so sorry. I have family in Nipawin who always went to the hockey games. All of Canada is reeling from this tragedy and our hearts are with you. 
This went really dark really fast and I was like ow my feels.


Friendship evolution
You probably still have some of his Pokemon that you've traded which will serve as awesome reminders of your times together
I feel great that I read this post. Thanks for sharing that story with me and everyone else.
A man's not dead while his name is still spoken. Keep naming those rivals after him and think of him when you do, and he'll never really be gone.
My condolences. 

In our hearts the dead live forever. 
Welp this was a sad post to read before bed

Sorry for your loss
I cannot imagine what you or any of the other loved ones of this tragedy may be feeling. Sending you love and strength from Toronto, my friend. 

I have two cousins who play hockey, and the oldest one I think is in a similar division as the Broncos. I’ve always worried that this could happen to one or both of them, and I’m so so very sorry that it’s your reality. I certainly forgot how to breathe for a few seconds when I saw the headline. 

Take care of yourself. Grieve however you need. All of Canada and the hockey industry is with you <3
 who is cutting onions near me 
Wow. Thank you so so much for sharing this. It’s amazing to see your experience with Pokémon went way passed just “catching ‘em all”. Thank you again, I legitimately started tearing up.
I'm truly sorry for your loss and everyone elses who had friends, brothers, sons and loved ones on that bus. 

Your story hits hard for he was a fellow player. May he play the heck out of Pokémon and all sports he loved in the great beyond.
I’m sorry to hear about your friend. I hope you and his family can get through this okay.

As a member of both the hockey community and the pokemon community and as one who has lost some childhood friends, this hits home.
Dude, you should get a tattoo of two “youngster” trainers (that area drawn to somewhat resemble the two of you as kids) in the Pokémon art style, with a Mudkip and a Treecko. (Assuming you’d have maybe picked grass starter if you actually got to play Ruby or Sapphire.) I bet you at least one of the folks who’s upvoted or commented is a good artist and would be more than willing to draw that up for you. Then you could permanently memorialize your friendship with him on your own body. Would be beautiful. 😢❤️
That was beautifully written and moved me to tears. I'm so sorry for your loss, my thoughts are with you and everyone who has been touched by this tragedy. Sending love from Ottawa. Stay strong my friend, I will name my Swampert after him. 
never say goodbye. if you don't say goodbye they're not really gone. they're just not here right now.

God damn it, I feel sorry as hell for you man, as someone who is going through high school with a friend group I respect the shit out of, this kills me
    Cherish them and tell them how much they mean every now and then, you'll never know when its too late 
Such a tragic story, I'm so sorry for your loss. Your friend is immortalized through love, as you know.
[removed]
    Upon reading this again, I wanted to apologize. I realize that I was insensitive here, and I am sincerely sorry for your loss, OP. Also, thank you to the people that prompted me to realize this was wrong.
Why weren't you allowed to play?
Thank you so much, that's what we are trying to do, celebrate life
He was amazing and I hope to be at least half as amazing to other people as he was to me
Exactly, thank you that means a lot!
His story and all the stories of those affected deserve to be heard and I'm glad it received such a warm reception. 
Thank you, this crash has affected so many people and I hope only the best to them. I also hope you're doing good as well, death is never easy to deal with and you seem to be living strong and remembering the good times, which is about all we can do. 
    Thank you for your reply. It means a lot- I haven't really thought about him in a while, and I'm happy to say that your post did remind me of the good times. Keep on pressing on, dude. :)
Well, to you and to OP, my deepest condolences, and he sounds to me like one of my friends, and I would hate to hear that he commuted suicide... at least you have fond memories
    [deleted]
        What happens if he was from Burlington? 
            He has to work at the town coat factory. 
The whole community got hit hard but we are all here for each other and seeing this support from outside is amazing too, thank you.
His name was Parker and that is amazingly sweet, thank you
    To be honest, the Diamond/Pearl rival seems like a such a big Parker. I hope we get to name our rivals again in the remakes, whenever that may be.
    I will name my Swampert and all my water starters in pokemon go parker now, if I knew how to send screen shots on mobile I would, but take my word for it they will all be changed tonight. I'll also name all my grass starters after you,  Maddog or mastaman? Inbox me if you have a different  nickname in mind
        Maddog would be just perfect haha, and thank you thats crazy I still can't believe some of this support
    You are welcome. I will help Parker to continue to live on.
    So #Parkermon
    Coincidentally about to play through Platinum. Will also name him Parker :) he definitely looks like a Parker.
    In memoriam, I will be doing this aswell. I had a similar situation a few years back, and I've named my starter after my friend Temple (last name, we were in JROTC together) since SS.

Parker is my rival's new name sir, and god bless.
Well shit, OP's friend [was believed to be alive until this morning](https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/8ayfqg/body_in_humboldt_bus_crash_misidentified_xavier/) when the person they thought was him woke up and said his name was Xavier.

[And apparently Parker's parents were in the room when it happened](http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/xavier-labelle-and-parker-tobin-ron-maclean-on-the-tragic-mix-up-of-the-two-humboldt-players/), This is getting more fucked up by the day.
    Yeah my family was in contact with them and hearing about that was heart breaking. 
This is a great idea. 
Same. Whichever game I start anew next, I’ll make sure to incorporate a meaningful name into it for him and you. Is there a specific name you’d prefer us to use? Your friendship can easily spread into thousands of Pokémon adventures this way.
Yeah I was thinking of restarting my alpha sapphire so that would be fitting to name him as my rival. 
Et moi
He's the type of friend everyone deserves I hope you have someone in your life like that and cherish them when you can.
I'm so glad you have someone like that, if you haven't talked to them in a while you should think about sending them a message and just catching up. Nothing lets us appreciate life more than the loss of it.
Can anyone tell me what the deleted comment said
    It was a “dang” bot comment. Just insensitive for the situation
    probably something inappropriate 
[removed]
I don't know the town personally but I've heard nothing but great things. Small town hockey embodies what Canada is and even though I have never played myself, that sense of community is so important and I'm glad that Canadians and beyond can all come together for that.
Wasn't Parker the guy who was thought to have survived, but when the guy woke up he said, "I'm Xavier", so that means you and OP are talking about the same guy! Parker is OPs friend.
    Whoa. That’s insane! r/nevertellmetheodds
        Yep, the world is a small place. Surprised that OP hasn't responded. You guys could remember him together. /u/MaddogMastaMan

I love how a Pokemon subreddit bring us altogether, from mourning a loved one, to helping people retrieve their lost Pokemon games/merchandise.
            Actually I didn’t really know him all that well. Sorry to burst your bubble of positivity :(
                oh, its aight
            I had sent him a message, I just didn't want to say last name in public. But yeah it is a crazy small world
                For sure dude.
Thank you, this crash hurt far and wide and I hope the best to everyone related to it. 
In Canada something like this is so uncommon so when it does happen it hurts bad, seeing the support even beyond is what really helps us pull through.
I'm glad that his story can touch people all over
    I'm speechless too...
As a fellow Canadian who likes sports (and who's favourite Pokemon is Mudkip), this hurts to read.

Personally I cannot even imagine how would I cope if one of my childhood friends who played pokemon games with me, just gone like this. I browse r/hockey rather frequently, and I just don't even have the courage to comment on the subject. They're all so young, even a little younger than me and it's gotta be one of the worst feelings in the world to see promising young lads just have their life cut short, so abruptly like that. 

It's weird, I haven't played Pokemon games since ...4 years ago, and I only came across this sub by coincidence (misclick) and this is the top voted post. I guess we're all connected in some way, the world truly is a small place.

Stay strong brother.
        I don't know anyone here that hasn't felt this a great deal, and that is a crazy coincidence. The needless loss of life through chance is saddening but all we can do is remember them and move on stronger and live for them. 
He would have got at least a good chuckle out of it for sure! Haha
Crazy indeed, but we can only keep looking up and remember the good times.
Its been a roller coaster, he was misidentified and we were told he was in the hospital until they checked the dental records and we found out the truth. Swampert will always have a special place because of him.
That's my exact thoughts, it may just be a reddit post but it helps his memory to live on
    to add on, when youre in a more emotionally stable place, creating a journal of memories helps, even if your memory degrades you can look at the whole of your relationship, the good, the growing up together, graduation meetups, even little fights are still memories that create a whole image of a beautiful person
Thank you, its wild to see how far this has traveled, it means a lot
Thank you, and I wish the best to the others affected, together we can get through this
Its a small part of the relationship between us but still a special one
Do it man, if you don't you may regret not doing so.
I'm so happy, I've had a lot of friends that I've falling outs with, but that never means it's irrepairable. Reach out and celebrate your friendship and appreciate that your both alive to do so. Take care
I'm so glad you have someone like that and please do reach out. Nothing remind us about the value of life than the loss of it, if you can value life through my experiences and not have to lose anyone close to you then that is even better. 
Thank you for that, we share a border so we are kinda stuck, might as well support each other when we can! 
Same to you, everyone can use more love
Yeah the accident was tragic and affected so many people, I've been seeing too many all too similar stories recently too.
    Similar to OP's or similar to the accident?
        Similar stories about those involved in the accident 
    I know so many people that were personally affected by the crash, it breaks my heart.
I don’t get it.
    What do you mean you don't get it? Read his post, it's pretty obvious..
        No, I mean I don’t quite understand your comment.
            OP said his friend played hockey, title said "in memory", put two and two together man.
                Now I get it, thanks for clarifying!
If he didn't have that gameboy when I met him who knows how it would have played out different
    Exactly. Look at my username lol I love the gameboy so much and it has changed my life, and yours, forever
You just reminded me to do the same thing, that's always been a heavy place and now it'll mean even more, thank you
Thank you for reminding me of the Celestial Tower Bell. I'm running Black aswell, so I guess i'll ring the bell for him too.
If only that bell could bring back people, like the bell of awakening from Dark Souls 3. Losing someone you had a deep bond with is truly devastating.
Thank you, that means a lot
Don't be too sorry, instead celebrate and enjoy the people around you while you have them
Its not much but its means a lot and that's what really matters
    Hey it has meaning to you, and that's what really matters.
Parker, I'm sure he'd love it
I'm so happy for you and Tyler, I hope you still talk and if you don't maybe think of sending a message and catching up. Appreciate life while its here! 
posts like these make me hope that when you die you can either choose to cease to exist or be reincarnated.
That's absolutely wild! Hey, even if you don't talk you both have those memories and that's what matters
He loved that meme when it started haha! 
It reaches much further than anyone would imagine. I hope you still talk to them and if not maybe think of reaching out and catching up, cherish the friendships you have, live life you know? 
I know I've been asking myself the same question all day haha
Thank you, this support is amazing and does really help those affected
Idk if you believe in tattoos but swampert is looking pretty prime
    I was thinking the same thing, who knows it might happen
He'll always be a part of me but I will keep moving on, its what he would have wanted and why not live my life to its fullest while I'm still here!
    Good for you man! Wise words, I'm sure this is what he would have wanted <3
Seeing this reach has been amazing and really shows how supportive this community is
    Definitely :) hope you enjoy my gift of gold btw
Still have my first ever starter up with me in gen 7!
It's tough when it's a number that you know affects so many people but when you start hearing about who they were it gets way harder. 
Thank you, even a small gesture like that so far away still means a lot
Remember to let him know how much he means to you every now and then. It may seem dumb but it'll be worth it in the end
Me too! What a great idea!
That is a beautiful and heart breaking story, I hope you cherish the memories with him and live your life the best you can in his honour. Lots of love from one friend to another. 
Just remember to tell him how much he means sometime, it may seem dumb but you never know when the last time you can will be
Live on in the good times and great memories, thank you
Neither was he but if he saw he was able to get a couple tears he'd be having a great laugh! I'm glad it resonated with you, thank you
That's so good that you have those memories! I hope you still talk to your one friend every now and then. I'm sure even those that moved away cherish those memories too!
Also being from Alberta it didn't hit me as hard as some people in Sask. that lost so many friends, but the one I did lose was one hell of a guy.
Thank you, I'm from Alberta too but sadly not at home so I couldn't leave my stick out. I'm hoping to be able to go back home for his vigil but with all the craziness of uni its a tough juggling act
Exactly, its about trading and interactions as much as it is about battles
Thank you, Ive had unbelievable support and the only thing I could hope for you to do is to cherish your friends while they are around.
    Heh, would if I had those :P

seriously, though, please let me know if you need someone to reach out to. I have some experience with the mental health field. At the very least, I can be an ear for you to speak to
I don't know but who ever it is has been following me around all day! Haha
    Me too, bro, me too. Sucks doesn't it?
Sharing the memories are all we can do at this point to celebrate, I'm glad you enjoyed reading it, it means a lot
It really is, I hope you have a friendship that you can say that about too!
Exactly, I have to do my best now because I know that's what he would have wanted
Thank you, the support has been amazing
We all go our own ways but we still deep down are friends 
Thank you, he grew up close to the Rockies so I'm happy to see the American side showing support too.
Thank you, celebrate his story though so he can live on
    I found your comment on his name, if I can find the games in which we can name our rival I’ll name my rival in honor of him. 
It hit all of Canada really hard but I'm glad we are all here to come together in these peoples time of need.

No one deserves something like this its just all chance so at least he lived a great life and I have great memories with him to look back on
Catching up with him when we graduated was a blast and really opened my eyes to the love that was still there even after all those years. I always try to be as friendly as possible because you never know who you will have these memories with, and whats more Canadian than being friendly eh!
Exactly, even if the world seems cold there is always those who care
    just a random question did your friend play oras with you?
It was just a dumb rule from my parents, weren't huge into anime and all that stuff and Pokemon was the prime focus of that for my age. But when they saw it made me happy and I was able to bond with people over it, they realized it was a dumb rule
Don't do this OP. Let the family mourn their loved one. If your friend moved away from Pokemon, then the game (if he still has it) is probably not easily accessible for you to find.
    Sorry, I did not mean right away. Obviously doing it anywhere near the time would be quite inappropriate.
    Why not? If it helps OP to respect his lost friend and it doesn't hurt anyone, there is absolutely NO reason to not.
        It can hurt the family if they are trying to mourn. It's disrespectful to ask now. 
The one who was misidentified was thought to be my mother’s cousin. Turns out it was a different person :(
    Sorry to hear it.
        We’re distant relatives, we barely knew him. I feel bad for his close friends and family.
No sadly he was the one they thought was still alive, but he will live on in the great times we had
    God, that's even worse. His family, you, to be given false hope... you're holding up remarkably well. I'm glad that sharing the story is helping you. I know what it's like to have someone suddenly ripped from your life.
    That's even worse than finding out the truth straightaway. I feel your pain.
Just like you said, cherish the good, instead of obsessing over his death we are all trying more to celebrate the life he had and the life we all have because of him
It's hit everyone in Alberta and Saskatchewan in one way or another and I'm glad everyone is still holding strong. I hope you cherish those memories you had and maybe if you get the chance you should send him a message and catch up if you can.
That's exactly my I made this and how I've been holding up
I'm glad his story has touched you, he'd get a good laugh of a stranger crying over him haha! Thank you
    Then you should know it's not just the one stranger who cried
I'm glad people get to hear about how great of a person he was
    Me too! It's still an awful tragedy, but you shared a little light in the dark. Thank you again. 
It has hurt so many people and I only hope the best for all of them, thank you
    I hope you are ok also. 
Oh it will, it sucks now but as long as we can focus on the good the bad won't seem so bad one day
    Exactly! I hope his family knows that too. It can be hard to lose someone you're close to.
I will never forget them, thank you
Well I never thought I'd cry while writing one haha!
Mainly because the story until the high school part is relatable an something almost equal has happened to me.
    It happens, I hope you cherish the memories you have
It has been a wild ride for everyone and knowing people who never would have met him get to see the kind of person makes it just a little bit easier
I am so sorry for you too, losing a friend, especially one you've had for a long time, is never easy. I will cherish the times and I hope you do the same with your friend 
Oh man the amount of good memories I have are endless this one just happened to stick out and I thought it would be good to share, thank you 
    Anytime, we’re here to support you ! His memory will live on.
My thought process today haha!
I'm glad I'm not the only one *laughs while crying*
The crash affected people far and wide and its amazing to see the support coming from even further than I could have ever imagined
I'll be just fine I am now only hoping the best for all the others affected, they are all amazingly strong
It's amazing how something so simple can effect someone so much
As someone who doesn't even play hockey it still hurt even before I found out my friend was involved. Its something so intrinsically Canadian that the ripples reach far and wide
I'm so sorry for your loss and it is touching to see how you've kept those memories close. Life is crazy fragile and nothing reminds us to cherish it more than when it is lost. Best to you
    Thank you so much.
This is something that has effected so many Canadians and seeing support from out East is amazing, thank you
    I'm here for you if you need someone
    And England!
Hockey and beyond, home town hockey is so fundamental to Canada that its affected so many, thank you
I'm glad you have those memories cherish them and those you shared them with while you can
What are we if not big kids that have responsibilities now haha. I'm glad you have those memories and cherish them like you should
    I agree 1000%. Too bad we can't be little forever
I wish only the best to you, a few people from my grad class have died but this one hit the closest. Of course, he wouldn't have wanted it any other way
It has and it is amazing to see Canadians and beyond unite to remember these great people
They sure kicked my ass to start with haha! Thank you
Oh trust me I have been haha!
Life is pretty wild and you never know when something like this will happen so just remember to cherish those close to you while you can
    Im glad you know that. The sooner you realize that all things in life are only temporary, the sooner you can not forget and move on but be at peace with accepting how fleeting life is. It's important to appreciate what you currently have because it will eventually be gone. You should also be excited for the new things, events and people that are soon to come in the future.
That's been the big thing that I haven't been able to take part in sadly because I am away at uni. Thank you for that gesture no matter how small it still counts (funny thing too is that he was the goalie, what are the odds!)
It's a feeling many can empathize with and I'm glad so many people can share the good times we had
Cherish them and tell them how much they mean every now and then, you'll never know when its too late 
Upon reading this again, I wanted to apologize. I realize that I was insensitive here, and I am sincerely sorry for your loss, OP. Also, thank you to the people that prompted me to realize this was wrong.
Thank you for your reply. It means a lot- I haven't really thought about him in a while, and I'm happy to say that your post did remind me of the good times. Keep on pressing on, dude. :)
[deleted]
    What happens if he was from Burlington? 
        He has to work at the town coat factory. 
To be honest, the Diamond/Pearl rival seems like a such a big Parker. I hope we get to name our rivals again in the remakes, whenever that may be.
I will name my Swampert and all my water starters in pokemon go parker now, if I knew how to send screen shots on mobile I would, but take my word for it they will all be changed tonight. I'll also name all my grass starters after you,  Maddog or mastaman? Inbox me if you have a different  nickname in mind
    Maddog would be just perfect haha, and thank you thats crazy I still can't believe some of this support
You are welcome. I will help Parker to continue to live on.
So #Parkermon
Coincidentally about to play through Platinum. Will also name him Parker :) he definitely looks like a Parker.
In memoriam, I will be doing this aswell. I had a similar situation a few years back, and I've named my starter after my friend Temple (last name, we were in JROTC together) since SS.

Parker is my rival's new name sir, and god bless.
Yeah my family was in contact with them and hearing about that was heart breaking. 
It was a “dang” bot comment. Just insensitive for the situation
probably something inappropriate 
Whoa. That’s insane! r/nevertellmetheodds
    Yep, the world is a small place. Surprised that OP hasn't responded. You guys could remember him together. /u/MaddogMastaMan

I love how a Pokemon subreddit bring us altogether, from mourning a loved one, to helping people retrieve their lost Pokemon games/merchandise.
        Actually I didn’t really know him all that well. Sorry to burst your bubble of positivity :(
