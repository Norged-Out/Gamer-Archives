[[My wife may be a crazy person]]


I got her to play her first ever Pokémon game. I went with platinum since it's the best.

She starts the game and picks Turtwig (nicknamed Pots). She is chilling and fights the first rival fight and beats Chimchar. She seems to be having a good time for the most part. But then it happens.

A few minutes later her Turtwig gets k/o'ed and she looks me dead in the eye and tells me that Pots is worthless and that she hates it for being a failure. 

Next she sees a Starly, "Ew. I hate that bird." How on earth could she hate Starly - one of the best bird lines in all of Pokémon. 

Just recently on her way to Oreburg she sees a Psyduck and tries to catch it. It breaks out of two balls which she decides is unacceptable thus making it ungrateful and unworthy of being on her team. She kills it and proceeds to look for more Pysduck to kill to drive the point home.

This sounds like a Sims player playing Pokemon, ngl.
    my sims gf gets unhinged apparently when i give em a pokemon game, the names really are a tell all
        My sims GF is also a Pokémon GF so I get the best of both worlds
    Can confirm this is what the experience is like
Oh my, she is gonna take things personal if she ever meets Cynthia at the Elite 4 LOL
    ....what about if she meets Mindy?
        u/TotalNo7564 please steer your wife into Mindy when the time comes 🤣
        who?
            the person who trades you a haunter, which normally evolves by trade, but the one she gives you is holding an everstone, and if it wasn't bad enough, she immediately taunts you regarding that.
                Bro... fuck that cunt 😂

    No we must get them GBA Fire red, Ruby, and Sapphire
    Yea fuck milotic 😮‍💨
    She a tough battle?
People like that are the reason Palworld exists
Is your Wife Paul?
    Honestly I thought of Paul Hollywood first..

Paul didn't stand out in my memories of pokemon rivals.
        You deserve a Hollywood handshake
            😂 yes please!! Oh the honor!
     who tf is Paul
        Ash’s rival in the gen 4 anime. He had a whole method of judging Pokémon based purely on their strength in battle.
            Crazy how I just watched a video about him abusing his chimchar, the similarities between her and Paul are striking
                And the fact that turtwig was Paul's starter
            Why did I think of the Apostle Paul first 😭
                I thought Paul Blart so....
                    A blunt rotation between the Apostle Paul, Paul Blart and Paul from Pokémon is WILD 😭
                        Don't forget Paul Wall
                            “What It Do It's Paul Wall, I'm The People's Champ”
                            And Paul the alien
                                The Paulverse is immense and must be respected, else the blunt rotation shall fall apart.
                        Paul McCartney for me
            Honestly Paul was the most interesting rival to me cos he really challenged Ash's training methods and was such an interesting foil for him. Their final battle in Sinnoh Leage Victors was probably the peak of the series battle wise for me
            Shout out to Paul🇹🇷👍
    I was about to comment this! lol
Load up a new save file of HGSS and have her battle Whitney
    Got milk?
    Or Gen 5 and Elesa with her volt switch Emolga(s)
        to be fair the volt switch emolgas as a gimmick usually only work once because you're ready for it next time you play. With Whitney and miltank getting stomp flinched into oblivion is always a threat because it has scrappy ability and miltank is fast as fuck.
            I hate that cow. Good thing I'm making jerky, so should I say miltank jerky
    Man did that battle suck as a kid.
    Whitney was easy.  Onix with rock smash was just trolling. She couldn't do much damage and rock smash, has a chance of lowering defense, so even if she did defense curl, it gets cancelled.
This would make an amazing copypasta
Well, I hate to see what happens if she finds a shiny.
    Especially Espeon.
this is very upsetting. turtwig is simply doing his best.
Honestly same
Request a divorce immediately.
"kills it"
    The game said “fainted” but her heart said “murdered”.
        She doesn't kill with her mons. Someone who kills with her mons has forgotten the face of her mother. She kills with her heart..
Your wife is… taking it too seriously in a joking way..
I’d be thinking about renewing my vows, she’s a keeper with jokes like that😂😂😂
    Tell me about it. The deadpan humor is so my type
That sounds like my little sister. In Pokemon mystery dungeon, shed throw blast seeds at her partner for "misbehaving"
    That’s wild I like it
Ngl when I first started playing Pokemon Diamond, fresh after having adored Omega Ruby and Fire Red (my first games, don't ask why those 2 specifically) I fucking HATED it.

That stupid high pitched sound Starly made (that still kinda catches me off guard if I'm not ready) how slow it all was compared to the other games I'd played, even some of the music wasn't totally vibing with me (mainly Orenburg, I dunno why that theme rly got on my nerves when I first heard it. Even listening to it now I see/hear why I didn't like it but I've come to appreciate it)

Gave the game a try again years later thru a modified copy of Platinum (mainly just changed a hex value to remove the FPS cap, therefore making the game run buttery smooth even on og hardware) and I loved every moment of it. Been chipping away at the game and am now at the 8th gym.

Have a friend whose big on Sinnoh and convinced me to give it another go. After seeing BDSP reveal, I knew I wasn't getting it cuz... cmon, would you get it based on that awful first trailer? I don't think so. I didn't, still haven't. So yea, thank him. I love Platinum. Give your wife time, she'll come around.
    How do you feel about the sound Kricketune made?
        That brings back memories holy cow
        Honestly prefer it over Starly still. It's just soooo high pitched.

They fixed it in later gens I think but in those first games it blasts you if you're not ready to hear it.

Still ended up adding Starly to my team and basically going for the defacto Gen 4 squad of Infernape, Lucario, Luxray, Staraptor, Gabite (unevolved still) and Azumarill, the only rly oddball pick.
    I must be one of the only people that play Pokemon games with the sound off 😂 The music annoys me after like 5 mins. I’d rather sit in silence or have the TV on the background 😂
        I mean I get that, game OSTs can be somewhat repetetive at times, tho that's exactly what my brain needs sometimes. I adore game OSTs and will always listen with sound on. Only game I usually turn music off for is Pokemon Go but that's just cuz it's like, the same theme for hours while I'm walking.
        You're not the only one! My sister and I both played with the sound off!
    ^^EEEE^^ooo^EEEEE!
It sounds like you should leave that relationship imo
This is hilarious! I read it to my wife and busted up laughing!  Yes please keep up with updates! And take my vote to boot!
    Aw man thanks! It has been super fun to watch so I’ll keep you posted :)
>Ew. I hate that bird

Just show her the Smogon page for Staraptor and she'll probably change her tune. She sounds worse than Silver...
She sounds like a team rocket villain. Lol
Dude, my ex-girlfriend was the exact same way! Like, same reasoning and everything.
    They should be friends lol
This should really be filmed and monetized so I can watch and you can supplement your rent.
    Ugh that would be sweet.
She’s got the makings of a champion
Lol I’d watch a series on this
OP this is the funniest thing I’ve read in a while, honestly… might just be a goldmine, I’d sub to a YouTube channel on the spot for this content!
she's winning
Idk, sounds like she’s having fun to me.
Playing a game the same way or a common way is actually more boring and being a mindless follower is crazier from my perspective
Help her get an egg maybe she’s lowkey a maternal
This is hilarious and need updates.
Platinum can be an investment sometimes. Notoriously slow, you have to commit, or you will get exhausted. Look no further than Roark to drive the point home. His Cranidos has an Attack stat that is much higher than anything you will have, so the only true option is really to just grind it out until you are an appropriate level.

Long way to say, that Pokemon Platinum, perhaps out of all the games, requires patience from the player.  
But don't hate your wife for this. Seems a bit much over a video game.
I love that no comment fights you on the fact that Plat is the best
    Omg I didn't even notice. So true lol
This is pretty funny. We definitely need more updates!
she sounds like a fun person to have around at parties tbh (complimentary).
do yall have any pets?
    We do! A little black pit mix. Wife loves her and treats her like a baby princess.
Bro, i just got scared reading all that 😱!!!! But it seems like she is a regular DnD player, enjoying pokemon. The only way they know by murdering everything.
your wife is Paul from the anime, congrats!
Paul, you married Paul from sinnoh
    It seems I did lol
This is one of the only times it's ok to say, "Geez, calm down, it's a kid's game!"
    It’s the ONLY time haha
Lol, she's perfect. Teach em all who's boss! And this may be heresy, but starly looks lame. Staraptor is the only cool one in the line
Black/white 2, lead her into the hidden Cynthia fight (or maybe she finds it herself) and see what happens👀
I like your wife
Need updates!
She sounds like Paul from the anime.
She may just be a serial nuzlocke player, the only fix is calling the Nintendo power hotline and waiting for the zombie that works there to answer the phone
Hey bud I’d double check the food she’s giving you.
Im freaking weak 3 red flags 🤣🤣
>How on earth could she hate Starly - one of the best bird lines in all of Pokémon. 

I mean, if you've never seen staraptor, it just looks like a bird. And in Platinum, it just looks like a psychotic bird.
Why does all this seem like me when I first played Pokémon?🤔🤔🤔🤔
Turtwig is awesome. Once it hits torterra it’s a semi bulky Pokémon that hits like a truck with stab earthquake
I'm giggling maniacally
I'm sorry that I commented 3 times but just letting you know your wife rocks
    Tell me about it haha
Lucky for her she doesn’t get to experience Whitney’s Miltank lmao
she isn't crazy, she's a gatekeeping gaslighting girlboss
    Facts
Susan the psyduck gon’ learnnnn todayyyy
I can't stop laughing, this is too funny. 🤣
Need a step by step analysis please!
    I’ll definitely add a part 2 :)
She's what you call a "based gamer".
I am eagerly awaiting the updates.
    I’ll report back as soon as she plays again!
She’s better off on Team Rocket.
Tell her to play Palworld
Ummmm I kinda want her to get to Cynthia just to see what happens 👀👀👀
    My hope is that she gets hooked and plays more than 15 minutes at a time. Cynthia is going to be an awesome showdown.
        She gets major points just for trying. Would LOVE if my bf even took a passing interest in anything Pokemon :-/
I need daily updates I'm invested god damn it
    I’m totally going to post updates! She will be playing more tomorrow :)
I'm invested in this "Wife plays Platinum" series
RUUUUUUUN!!!!
1984 (Pokémon)
NTA Divorce
Sounds normal
I'm so sorry.





Time to talk to a divorce lawyer.
Are you married to Silver's twin sister?
Well the whole Turtwig line is awful, but the starly line is awesome, she seems normal for a first time player honestly.
Sounds hilarious
They usually are
Red flags!
NO DOUBT.  Compromise like you understand
That’s pretty much how I acted my first time playing Pokémon. Of course, I was 7….
honestly, i get it
Is your wife Silver?
    Lol.  Or Silver's twin sister?
Alright so who has made the cut so far?
    As of Part 2 she has Turtwig, Ponyta, and Shinx :)
Ok but what did she say about our lord and savior bidoof?
    She HATES bidoof. I told her that she could use him for an HM slave at least
If it’s her first one she not looking at it through kid goggles the way you still do
    It’s true! She has a lot less childlike curiosity but still finds a lot of it satisfying
        Yea same my wife cannot get into the series but she loved legends of arceus she did play shield first but didn’t enjoy as much
“Platinum since it’s the best” 

Df is wrong with you
    Don’t you be talking smack about Platinum
The cringe😬
    :0
The crazy part is saying Platinum is the best
    Whooooaaa chill chill chill
Starly is ugly tbf.
Her not liking starly is a green flag.
That's so me coded
This is the enjoyment I didn't know I needed!
Starly line fuckin sucks. I literally got a shiny of it back when I had original Diamond, and promptly put it in my box cause I ain't like the pokemon or the color palette. Ended up giving it to my boy that loves that emo bird for some reason, and got a shiny charmander which he had an extra of, so win win for me lol
    My dude. Starly and its evolutions are some of the best regional birds ever made. They are nearly a must have on a sinnoh team. The only other valid replacements are Togekiss or Crobat.
        I fucking love starly
        Yeah which is why I always had a Crobat. One of my favorite pokemon of all time. To each their own, right?
        Yeaaaaa I’m a crobrat bro. Screw your pigeot remix (respectively)
            Staraptor is better than pidgeot without its mega.
                I understand but I am still not a fan of
    HAHA the first sentence killed me! My wife saw this comment and upvoted instantly.
        That's funny, and great cause there's pokemon for everybody to like. I don't absolutely hate that line. They learn great moves. Anyway I hope she's goes on to fall in love with these games the way we have! Gen 4 is truly a masterpiece in my opinion.
            I totally agree.
Based.
Ngl, or she needs to act more mature or games are not her thing
Btw it's funny to know what her has done, I'll be waiting part 2
I do the same thing when a Pokemon just doesn’t want to be caught.
    I especially feel that way in PokemonGo
my sims gf gets unhinged apparently when i give em a pokemon game, the names really are a tell all
    My sims GF is also a Pokémon GF so I get the best of both worlds
Can confirm this is what the experience is like
....what about if she meets Mindy?
    u/TotalNo7564 please steer your wife into Mindy when the time comes 🤣

I mean I get that, game OSTs can be somewhat repetetive at times, tho that's exactly what my brain needs sometimes. I adore game OSTs and will always listen with sound on. Only game I usually turn music off for is Pokemon Go but that's just cuz it's like, the same theme for hours while I'm walking.
You're not the only one! My sister and I both played with the sound off!
She gets major points just for trying. Would LOVE if my bf even took a passing interest in anything Pokemon :-/
Yea same my wife cannot get into the series but she loved legends of arceus she did play shield first but didn’t enjoy as much
I fucking love starly
Yeah which is why I always had a Crobat. One of my favorite pokemon of all time. To each their own, right?
Yeaaaaa I’m a crobrat bro. Screw your pigeot remix (respectively)
    Staraptor is better than pidgeot without its mega.
        I understand but I am still not a fan of
That's funny, and great cause there's pokemon for everybody to like. I don't absolutely hate that line. They learn great moves. Anyway I hope she's goes on to fall in love with these games the way we have! Gen 4 is truly a masterpiece in my opinion.
    I totally agree.
the person who trades you a haunter, which normally evolves by trade, but the one she gives you is holding an everstone, and if it wasn't bad enough, she immediately taunts you regarding that.
    Bro... fuck that cunt 😂

😂 yes please!! Oh the honor!
Crazy how I just watched a video about him abusing his chimchar, the similarities between her and Paul are striking
    And the fact that turtwig was Paul's starter
Why did I think of the Apostle Paul first 😭
    I thought Paul Blart so....
        A blunt rotation between the Apostle Paul, Paul Blart and Paul from Pokémon is WILD 😭
            Don't forget Paul Wall
                “What It Do It's Paul Wall, I'm The People's Champ”
                And Paul the alien
                    The Paulverse is immense and must be respected, else the blunt rotation shall fall apart.
            Paul McCartney for me
Honestly Paul was the most interesting rival to me cos he really challenged Ash's training methods and was such an interesting foil for him. Their final battle in Sinnoh Leage Victors was probably the peak of the series battle wise for me
Shout out to Paul🇹🇷👍
I hate that cow. Good thing I'm making jerky, so should I say miltank jerky
