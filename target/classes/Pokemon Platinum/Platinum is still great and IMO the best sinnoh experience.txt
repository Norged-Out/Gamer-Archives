[[Platinum is still great and IMO the best sinnoh experience]]


Affter beating Briliant Diamond last month I wanted to play platinum again after so many years not touching the game, and I have to say, it was one of the best experiences I just had with a pokemon game in a long time. Not saying bdsp is a bad game, but I just fell like platinum just brought sinnoh to life in a way that both the original dp and now bdsp failed to do. 

Its surprising how much platinum improved the story, pacing and characters of sinnoh, specially Cyrus that now became one of my favorite team leaders. 

Its also nice to note how the ds graphics have aged well. Floarpma town and Snowpoint city are just beatifull in the ds graphics. 

Anyway, would like to know if you agree. In your opinion what is the best sinnoh experience ?


Not a hot take honestly, I vehemently hated gen 4 until i played platinum, now i like it
    This right here! If it wasn't for Platinum I would've stayed hating Gen 4!
    Yeah this take is super cold.
I do appreciate how Platinum has a more complete postgame with the extra things going on in Stark Mountain and so on. From a pure gameplay perspective, I'd say Platinum > BDSP > DP.
    Probably an unpopular opinion but i would rather have had a remastered Platinum than BD/SP.
        I completely agree and I can assure you that it is by no means an unpopular opinion.
Platinum had better post game, I spent so long grinding money to fill out my villa at the resort area, plus the whole Distortion World was dope.
bdsp feels easy partly due to affection and partly due to having 15 years of experience 

The forced exp share is anti ubergring
if there was no platinum, i think gen 4 would have been the least liked region, DP where just so bad and seemed rushed, it was so slow, the gym/e4 teams were so trash, the whole sinnoh dex wasn't avaialble. I am shocked that game came out in that state. I honestly believe platinum saved sinnoh
Of course it is. Platinum is one of the best pokemon games made.

DP and BDSP are just decent.
Totally agreee. 2D pokemon will always be the definitive experience. The world is more immersive, your imagination is actually valued, and the sprites look more reflective of the offical artwork than the 3D models do.
    The only game in 3d that I really like the world is oras.
        I actually iked SM's world and presentation of it quite a bit, but still doesn't top BW2's for me. gen 8 is the epitome of meh, oras is alright but I prefered the world in emrald, XY I haven't played in a long time so the jury's out on that (although just looking at it, it doesn't hold a candle to the best of the 2D worlds.) I haven't played BDSP yet but I'll buy it when the price drops a bit, which will probably happen when LOA comes out.
            Bw2 was the peak of Pokémon innovation
                It even had multiple difficulty modes. In classic Gamefreak fashion, they were of course implemented in the most absurd way possible.

                    Then they stoped trying
It is just a fact. The remakes are objectively worst. 

They literally take out or make worst features from the original, do a horrible translation from 2 screens to 1 screen, same goes for 2d to 3d, not a single good feature in platinum, unadjusted EXP share forced all time...

All in exchance for a new underground area and 6 unfair fights just at the end. Not even a single QooL to the horrible catch methods from a lot of mons or, idk, A FIRE TYPE (houdoom is locked under RNG from underground stuff). 

Platinum managed that better, expanded the region and made the pokedex not horrible, all of that while having a consistent art style.
The Gen IV remakes should have been remakes of Platinum, just keep the Galactic stuff focused on the single box legendary of each respective version, and have the Giratina/Distortion World part in both versiions as an extension of the original Spear Pillar Scene, with the mythicals as a post-game section akin to the Delta Chapter. Full Battle Frontier, etc.
I would have agreed with you if gen 4 as a whole didnt suffer from being incredibly slow. To me that ruins the playability
    Emulator’s speed up function is the true savior of Gen 4
As someone who's first own Pokémon game was Platin, I have to agree.
I mean, Platinum expanded characters, but the characters were still pretty terrible. Cyrus is still a bad villain in terms of logic and reasoning, and no amount of character development will make what he tried to do make sense outside of him having a mental issue or something.

Giratina and the Distortion World was nice, but, like many other Pokémon games, they had essentially no relevance to the story outside of the five-ten minutes that they show up.

The gym designs were cool I guess, although I myself don't necessarily care too much about it.

As far as teams, I prefer D/P teams. I'm against mono-type gym leaders and Elite 4 teams, so seeing things like Drifblim, Steelix, Lopunny, Octillary, etc is vastly more interesting than the fixed teams in Platinum.

As far as *The* Sinnoh experience, I'd say Platinum and bdsp are tied in my opinion. They both have pros and cons that make me love and dislike them. Both aren't perfect, despite my adoration for gen 4.
    platinum may not develop cyrus but was it really necessary to develop it? cyrus is just a crazy guy, self-centered and probably with some emotional disorder that makes him act the way he did with the intention of destroying the universe and rebuilding it without the human spirit in his view, I don't think he really needed development, ghetsis also doesn't have a character development besides being cruel and manipulative and everyone loves him as a villain, the distorted world may not add much to the gameplay but in the lore it adds a LOT along with the giratina which was probably the biggest goal and the rest it's more personal taste even about the teams and the difficulty but honestly I still think Platinum is MUCH superior to BDSP which are basically remakes of the "incomplete" versions of sinnoh
        >platinum may not develop cyrus but was it really necessary to develop it? cyrus is just a crazy guy, self-centered and probably with some emotional disorder that makes him act the way he did with the intention of destroying the universe and rebuilding it without the human spirit in his view, I don't think he really needed development

"Just some crazy guy" is not really a good reason, for me anyway. I get that crazy people exist, but usually in writing there's some deeper reason for why the antagonist is the way they are.

A somewhat understandable reason.

Having a villain trying to destroy the world in a video game for the sake of destroying it because "wynaut" is incredibly boring.

>the distorted world may not add much to the gameplay but in the lore it adds a LOT along with the giratina which was probably the biggest goal 

What substantial bits does it add in the lore of the Pokémon world? I'm very curious on this one because, as far as I can tell, there's not much.
            it was explained that the distorted world exists to balance the pokemon world of matter with the antimatter that there exist and giratina watches over the pokemon world from there and if necessary he intervenes as he did with cyrus, trapping him in his world and well cyrus was never meant to be an interesting villain given his design and way of acting, he's basically a guy with problems without much depth who found he could remake the world his vision and manipulated people to do the dirty part and left the most serious part for him as he is a scientist in platinum
                >it was explained that the distorted world exists to balance the pokemon world of matter with the antimatter that there exist and giratina watches over the pokemon world from there and if necessary he intervenes as he did with cyrus

Yes. Giratina is not evil, just does what needs to be done. I don't think that's a huge lore drop, lol. 

>cyrus was never meant to be an interesting villain given his design and way of acting, he's basically a guy with problems without much depth who found he could remake the world his vision and manipulated people to do the dirty part and left the most serious part for him as he is a scientist in platinum

That's the problem, he wasn't interesting. Saying that the main antagonist is not supposed to be interesting doesn't make me excited to face the main antagonist. I get it, it's a Pokémon game and characterization is pretty much nonexistent with most NPCs, but I don't think a character being boring "because he's not supposed to be exciting" is a good reason for the character to be boring, lmao.
                    well several antagonists are like this: cyrus, lysandre, rose, giovanni, they are not very interesting as people or villains but they play their role in the story, on the other hand: lusamine and ghetsis are great interesting villains and maxie and archie are great antagonists too
                        >well several antagonists are like this

Yes, I know. Uninteresting characters is not a problem with just Platinum, but with the entire Pokémon franchise. I only specified Cyrus because we're specifically talking about Platinum here.
    I'm sorry but to say platinum is as good as BDSP??? You've gotta be trolling. Everything else was pretty legit in my opinion in terms of criticism. 

Tho Cyrus also wasn't really a villain you were supposed to identify with either. He was cold, cruel, and sometimes, those people and their motives simply don't make sense. He did a great job being simply "evil" and providing growth to the other galactic leaders. In the end, even they'll tell you his motives didn't make much sense to them either, but he was charismatic and they wanted a different world. Cyrus may have been "crazy," but it showed he was opportunistic too and would use his charisma and others desires and discontent to his advantage

He saw others (people and Pokemon) as tools at his disposal no matter how close. His cold heart would eventually rip apart even the very fabric of time and space if not stopped by you and Giratina. The story was already out there to begin with, what more do you want? You guys want everything to make sense and even in the real world it doesn't. Cut them some slack here man
        >I'm sorry but to say platinum is as good as BDSP??? You've gotta be trolling. Everything else was pretty legit in my opinion in terms of criticism. 


Not really. Outside of the Battle Frontier, I'd say they're pretty tied. But that's just for me. Everyone is free to have their own opinions.

Cyrus may have been "crazy," but it showed he was opportunistic too and would use his charisma and others desires and discontent to his advantage


That's boring, though. A villain being evil because "I'm evil" has been done countless times already. They could've explored on the mental instability happening within Cyrus to better see just what was going on in his head, rather than being a simple "I grew up, saw emotions were bad, so will kill the world." At least with ORAS they tried to make Maxie's and Archie's motivations seem *somewhat* understandable, thank God because their R/S/E iterations were also God awful.

Team Galactic didn't know what was happening because they were pretty much kept in the dark through his actual plan last I checked. But that doesn't mean they couldn't do something more with Cyrus. He doesn't have to be a villain that people can see themselves in and connect with. But anything would've made him better than how he is. 

>The story was already out there to begin with, what more do you want? You guys want everything to make sense and even in the real world it doesn't. Cut them some slack here man

I want characters to be interesting, yes. Cyrus is not a good character. Most characters in gen 4 aren't, and I can admit that despite gen 4 being my favorite gen. The story may be out there, but that doesn't mean they can't make interesting characters.
I havnt played BDSP but back when Pearl and Diamond originally came out (I was like 14 then I think) I could not make it through the game for the life of me and up till this point I had beaten every Pokemon game I got from the main series. I just felt no interest in the gen :/ then Platinum came out and I figured I'd try once more and I absolutely loved it. I still think back to it occasionally as I just really enjoyed the Platinum experience.
I’ve been playing a mod hack called Renegade Platinum, it improved and updated a lot of aspects to the game, and is definitely worth checking out
is that even a point of discussion? Platinum is objectively better in pretty much every way.
If you haven't already, check out renegade platinum. 


I played it last year and it completely ruined BDSP for me. It's what pokemon games should be. Difficult battles and proper level scaling, a few type adjustments to make some pokemon a bit more unique or viable and best of all, all pokemon are obtainable with no trade evolutions (i got to use gengar and porygon z xD).

    What about the lack of good pokemon available, worst story, bad gym leaders and elite four teams, lack of content and worst pacing ?
        [deleted]
            Only elite 4 the rest of the npc teams in bdsp are really bad
                I don't see how it can be that bad given the fact that you can encounter every single local Pokemon except legendaries and unown with just trainer battles.

Can any other game say that?

                    What ? Platinum was the game that introduced the battle frontier. There wanst a battle frontier in dp.
                        [deleted]
                            For real ? I know emerald created the battle frontier. I said that platinum introduced the sinnoh BF, because you said that it removed it and therefore you were wrong.
    Platinum fixed the slow engine issues.
If platinum just had increased speed on animations it might be the perfect Pokémon game ngl
Definitely. As usual, the extra version is more polished. I as so disappointed BDSP didn't carry the changes/ additions from Platinum like HGSS did with Crystal.

edit: who the fuck downvoted me?!
I played a Platinum playthrough to get ready for the BDSP release. Saw the games when they came out and realised I was satisfied with my Platinum playthrough even though it was my tied first favourtie pokemon game.
I absolutely agree. After I beat BD I don't plan on playing it again, but a replay of Platinum I'd take any day
'Best Sinnoh Experience' kinda like saying 'Best Root Canal'.
i love platinum, one of my favorites
Renegade Platinum is *the* best way to experience gen4, and might even be the best pokemon game overall to play. Sacred Gold/Storm Silver being up there too.
Platinum is my favourite game by far. It's so fun.
Platinum have just ONE fault: *little miss* is Diamond exclusive
    They had to give diamond and pearl something lol
This right here! If it wasn't for Platinum I would've stayed hating Gen 4!
Yeah this take is super cold.

I get it, it's a Pokémon game and characterization is pretty much nonexistent with most NPCs, but I don't think a character being boring "because he's not supposed to be exciting" is a good reason for the character to be boring, lmao.
        well several antagonists are like this: cyrus, lysandre, rose, giovanni, they are not very interesting as people or villains but they play their role in the story, on the other hand: lusamine and ghetsis are great interesting villains and maxie and archie are great antagonists too
            >well several antagonists are like this

Yes, I know. Uninteresting characters is not a problem with just Platinum, but with the entire Pokémon franchise. I only specified Cyrus because we're specifically talking about Platinum here.
Only elite 4 the rest of the npc teams in bdsp are really bad
    I don't see how it can be that bad given the fact that you can encounter every single local Pokemon except legendaries and unown with just trainer battles.

Can any other game say that?

                For real ? I know emerald created the battle frontier. I said that platinum introduced the sinnoh BF, because you said that it removed it and therefore you were wrong.
It even had multiple difficulty modes. In classic Gamefreak fashion, they were of course implemented in the most absurd way possible.

    Then they stoped trying
>it was explained that the distorted world exists to balance the pokemon world of matter with the antimatter that there exist and giratina watches over the pokemon world from there and if necessary he intervenes as he did with cyrus

Yes. Giratina is not evil, just does what needs to be done. I don't think that's a huge lore drop, lol.
