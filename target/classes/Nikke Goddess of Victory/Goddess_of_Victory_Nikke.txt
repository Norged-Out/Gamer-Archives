==Story==
''Goddess of Victory: Nikke'' takes place in a post-apocalyptic future where the Earth was suddenly attacked by extraterrestrial mechanical creatures called Raptures that destroyed everything on the surface, forcing the remaining humans to take refuge underground and establish the Ark, a metropolis ruled by the Central Government. The [[Private military company|PMC]] manufacturers Elysion, Missilis Industry and Tetra Line—owned by Ingrid, Syuen and Mustang, respectively—that compose the Big Three work on converting women and children into powerful obedient soldiers called Nikkes to be used as a weapon to defeat the Raptures and restore humanity on the surface.{{sfn|Shift Up|2022|loc=scene: Anis episode 2: Food. "'''Anis''': 'Elysion, Missilis Industry, Tetra Line. ... Only they can produce Nikkes. ... Each company has its own expertise. Let me think... I remember Elysion's expertise is military supplies, food, and transportation. Tetra's are entertainment, clothes, daily necessities... The rest are all Missilis' fields, I think.'|ps="}}{{sfn|Shift Up|2022|loc=chapter 16}} Due to their prominence, the Big Three [[CEO]]s have very high authority; they are, however, heavily monitored by the Central Government to prevent any hostile behavior.{{sfn|Shift Up|2022|loc=chapter 02. "'''Syuen''': 'You do realize that the CEOs of the Big Three have the same authority as Deputy Chiefs?'|ps="}}{{sfn|Shift Up|2022|loc=scene: Anis episode 2: Food. "'''Anis''': 'Of course, there may be some aggressive behavior from the big companies. Our great Central Government keeps its eyes on the Big Three.'|ps="}}
The story is played from the perspective of the Commander who graduated from the Military Academy one day prior to the events of the game;{{sfn|Shift Up|2022|loc=chapter 00}} despite this, they perform extraordinarily in the operations and survive various encounters with rare Rapture species throughout the journey.{{sfn|Shift Up|2022|loc=chapter 08. "'''Andersen''': 'You're the only Commander who has survived multiple encounters with Chatterbox. You're the first to come in contact with the Pilgrims and the Heretics, and witness an altercation between them. You're also the first to see one of their former subordinates become a Heretic.'|ps="}} They lead a squad called Counters, which consists of the Nikkes Anis, Rapi and later down the story, Neon.{{sfn|Shift Up|2022|loc=chapter 02}} The Commander views Nikkes with sympathy and privately advocates for Nikke rights, which is illegal in accordance with the laws of the Ark.{{sfn|Shift Up|2022|loc=chapter 16}} Outlaws may be sent to the Rehabilitation Center or the Outer Rim, an area fully isolated from the rest of the Ark, and they have formed terrorist organizations claiming to fight for [[human rights]] for themselves.{{sfn|Shift Up|2022|loc=scene: Anis episode 4: People in the Outer Rim}}
==Development and release==
''Nikke'' was developed by South Korean-based studio Shift Up working with Level Infinite, a publishing brand of [[Tencent Games]]. Development began between 2017 and 2018 with an internal planning competition of which one idea was selected to be the predecessor of the game.{{sfn|Seo (서)|2021|loc="김형태 대표는 '니케는 시프트업이 5년만에 내놓는 신작'"}}
Shift Up's CEO Kim Hyung-tae, who was responsible for the [[video game producer|production]] and [[Game art design|illustrations]] of the game, said in an interview with ''[[IGN|IGN Japan]]'' that the battle environment features life-size models using [[Live2D]], Shift Up and Level Infinite hosted [[beta test|closed beta test]]s for the global version between the announcement and its release, allowing selected registrants to test out the game mechanics. The game contains [[voice-over]]s in English, Japanese and Korean.{{sfn|Nagaoka (長岡)|2022|loc="今回のグローバルクローズドβテストで新たに追加されたメインストーリーを、日本語、英語、韓国語のフルボイスで楽しめる。|ps="}}
Shift Up first revealed ''Nikke'' along with ''[[Stellar Blade]]'' at the Crank in Showcase event in 2019, A [[Microsoft Windows]] version of the game was released on February 15, 2023, with, soon later, a brand collaboration with manga series ''[[Chainsaw Man]]'' that introduced characters therefrom as playable characters. The game has since collaborated with the RPG ''[[Nier: Automata]]'' in September of the same year and the series ''[[Re:Zero]]'' in March 2024.
==Reception==
-->
According to data analysis from SensorTower, ''Nikke'' grossed over $70&nbsp;million in revenue in its first month of release, --> It reached a total of $400&nbsp;million less than one year after its release, and saw over 25&nbsp;million downloads before the Windows port's release. its unique ''gacha'' mechanics may have also been a contributing factor.
''Goddess of Victory: Nikke'' was nominated for the [[Famitsu scores|Famitsu Dengeki Game Awards]] 2022's "Best App" category.
== Controversies ==
Following the release of a character costume, players criticized Tencent for having the design altered from beta versions to show less revealing clothing. Since Tencent is based in China, its video games must adhere to the [[Censorship in China|censorship policies of China]] in addition to those of other jurisdictions.
In January 2023, an official Thai advertisement—which depicted a ''Nikke'' player watching Anis', Rapi's and Marian's bouncing buttocks and fantasizing about such with [[cosplay]]ers—was taken down and apologized for by Tencent after they received backlash from Thai fans who were unhappy with the portrayal of the playerbase. This pullback, however, faced another backlash from a different portion of fans who were already upset with the censorship, claiming that "there is nothing wrong with the ad for being honest about why some players are attracted to the game".
