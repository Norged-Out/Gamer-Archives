[[Dot damage go brrrrrr]]





the sound effect of Nihility doing its thing gets me going.
    I have to admit that the Tales DoT trial characters made me consider pulling for Kafka but I'm passing for now. I've invested too much into another lightning character JY and I need more elemental coverage like imaginary and ice.
        Ice DPS are limited to Herta and Yanqing, and Herta sucks while Yanqing is hard to get. Pela is like Yun Jin, Ice but actually isn't Ice and just generalist. March is March, shield bot.
            March is an excellent AOE Freeze spammer when you build Effect hit rate & Energy regen on her.
I'm gonna be honest that is me playing the remembrance path and watching the healthbar disappear without them getting a trun
    The 3 stars blessing which give dissociation when attacking frozen enemy and the 2 stars blessing which remove dissociation and gives extra damage is *chef kiss*.
        And then there‚Äôs the runs where you don‚Äôt roll dissociation and do absolutely 0 damage
            Or you run into that big blue elite that seems to be immune to freeze.
                This happened to me earlier today. It was so frustrating lol. I still killed him but it was *slow*
                I believe there's an enchancement that ignores freeze immunity on some of those remembrance cards.
        Does it remove the freeze?
            No, only the dissociation, so you can have character attack to apply the debuff and then another turn attack to deal 30% of total health damage.
    Or hunt with Seele and Bronya, so many Seele turns with her skill critting over 100k with the right blessings
        I was getting my butt beat in world 7, Hunt Path saved my life. I love moving 6 times and doing 4 ultimates before the enemy can think üòÉ!
            Yesterday I was going against the deer boss and my Seele attacked 13 times consecutively. Poor deer...
        On world 7, if you have the resonance formation that gives you resonance energy whenever you kill enemies below 50% HP, the trees can be two shot. There are four trees, so you can chain resonances (first use gets trees to 50%, second kills them all, four trees, each equals 50% energy, so you get both back and most likely the deer is dead now too) to just kill everything. 

I completed a run like that, and my actual characters only went once or twice.
        Got a 320k something critical with seele in with path of the hunt this morning. Got a nice trophy for it too. She's a beast.
Svarog counter attack with elation path in an SU run be like:
    Plus fireworks!
    The aftertaste shit is so satisfying
Nihility gang
I love giving people cancer
Can't wait for CEO of dots next week
    She is coming home
Watching 1 dot from Sampo deal 64k dmg. *Beautiful.*
Big numbers, many numbers, colorful numbers, monke brain activates
God I cant wait to get Kafka and Luka and tear up SU in nihility path
I originally build Sampo as a joke, now he's my main. His DoT just feels so good. The only time it doesn't feel good is when i don't get any Nihility upgrades, or if i don't get the Suspicion upgrade
Nihility path is so fun
    Once you try out you wont be able go whithout it
        For real. I find it hard to pick anything else now. Next week is gonna be good.
Dot damage üòî
Oh yeah that's me but with Jing and elation..
its all a psyop to make me pull kafka
Me next week with my e1 s1 Kafka (prayge)
Yeah seeing those big colorful numbers just gives me a dopamine rush.
Those are rookie numbers
How many of these are from SU? *unimpressed*
basically every player in every turn base rpg
Ice damage makes enemies go ‚Äúbrrrr‚Äù
Me when I see silver wolf
himeko, herta, serval, sampo, jing yuan

=

happy brain on the tales event fr
Watching the Dot deciding to completely both confuse me and kill every without trying is one of the main reasons why I'm still fundamentally pissed Sampo refuses to so much as even come home.
    Hopefully you get him on kafka banner. Good luck!
        Unfortunately I won't be able to since I'm not pulling on her banner.

Blade (being the bastard that he is) didn't come home, neither did any 5* so I'm sitting at a big amount of pity. I'm pulling for Dan Heng IL so I cant risk it especially since I've been dried of my Jades. So not only do I have to skip Sampo but I also have to skip Luka.
This is why im going for Kafka xD
As a relatively new player who enjoys Sampo and Serval (and really wants Kafka for many reasons), this pleases me LOL.
me but when i have bladey, himiko and herta on elation on the deer and i get them all to follow up and my frame rate halves

no but seriously while my herta isn't built at all she makes the most numbers fly and that makes me happy
