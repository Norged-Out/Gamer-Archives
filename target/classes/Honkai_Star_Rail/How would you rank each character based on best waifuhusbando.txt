[[How would you rank each character based on best waifuhusbando]]


Here's mine

1. Kafka (dommy mommy)
2. Tingyun (she's nice)
3. March 7th (cute af)
4. Asta (hoshiboshi)
5. Sampo (hear me out...)

(I didn't mention herta :( . Apology to SexWithHerta)


1. Stelle (I too like trashy things and to me she's very cute)
2. Qingque (very relatable. A gambler and a slacker)
    Qingque is the most relatable person in the game for sure.

At this point, u/SexWithHerta will become a global icon in both the official subreddit and the okbuddy subreddit
March really brings the cute funny appeal to adventuring and her humor along with reactions are second to none
    Ikr. I dont get it why some people hate her
        It's just different strokes for different folks.  


I find March incredibly annoying. Other people dislike the characters that I like. It just is what it is.
1. Yanqing and Arlan - Both fighting for the first place, being the cutest pumpkins in the game
2. Serval - Punkrock musician? Mechanic-rascal? Big sister? Count me in!
3. Sampo - Hands (and pants) down the best character in the game, being the first and only 6\* unit^(1) 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

(1) - according to the famous polish game critic S.Koski
    Arlan is badass
        Arlan best boi
    Yanqings like 12 yo
1) Stelle - Cause her personality and sense of humour from the dialogue choices are absolute top tier gremlin trash-panda

2) Seele - Been a seele stan since honkai impact 3 and it ain't gonna stop now chief

3) March 7th - Very bully-able but in a best friend kinda way and also seems like a blast to hang out with

4) Kafka - Mommy

Honourable mentions to pretty much most of the cast cause I love them all! Don't really hate anyone atm
    Seele's voice in honkai impact 3 is cute af
        Ya! That's why i call myself a Seele stan rather than saying she's my waifu. She is in the 'Must protecc at all cost' category XD Similar to Clara and Hook here, they all so damn cute! <3
Kafka: I could listen to her talk all day long(EN), not really into the dommy mommy thing but she is Waifu  
Only other character I would pull for these reason I cannot and probably will not be able to get so the game is pretty dry imo.
1. Natasha

2. Serval

3. Pela

4. Asta

5. Fu Hua
Why has no one mentioned Himeko yet?
1. Dan Heng
2. Ying yuan
3. Luocha
4. Kafka
5. Blade
Tingyun is my top pick with himeko as a 1.5, march 2 and stelle 3
1. Daddy light-I mean Jing Yuan. (I am a simp thats why.)
2. Dan Haeng (first cutscence. and im still a simp woof woof)
3. Arlan (I want to pet him and his dog.)
4. Gepard (Hot sister and could carry your team both metaphorically and literally)
5. Himeko (Mom?)

Honrable mentions: Blade, Sampo and Yukong
    The dog belongs to Asta
        Officially, yes, but Arlan seems to take care of Pep so much it feels like fluff ball is his.
PomPom solos
    Smash?
        For the meme I need to say yes right?
            But doesnt that make you a furry?
Welt would be first.

Herta be the last, because personality
    Herta has the best personality. "Do you know who I am?"
        "Even seen a diamond this big?"

**IT'S ALL YOURS**
            "You must be honored to meet me"
Seele: Yes

Bronya: Yes

Silver Wolf: Yes

Qingque: Yes

Asta: Yes

Natasha: Yes
1. Kafka, what's that, a hot, mean lady who will tell me what to do? Why not just turn my knees to jelly forever
2. Serval, she's fun, smart, talented, and has impeccable fashion sense
3. Tingyung, I'm a fan girl of big fluffy tails, and she's so supportive
I don't think there are enough cute boys in the game. All the ones I've encountered seem kinda flat imo. That said

March (cute)

Asta (cute)

Seele (cute)

Himeko (hot)

Kafka (hot)
1. Asta
2. Fu
3. Qingque
4. March
5. Tingyun

Not sure if this would be my permanent list but without giving much thought that is it
Jing Yuan
Blade
Gerpard

Snake likes your ranking.
Number one: Silver Wolf.
Number two: Literally everyone else

I am slightly biased if you can’t tell
1. Seele and Jingliu - pretty and cool af.
2. Bronya and Silver Wolf - super pretty.
3. Quinque - cute and relatable.
4. Kafka - hot.
5. Gepard - gooddest boi.
    Gepard can be a good boy for me
1. I'd do Gepard. He is hot and looks kempt. Not sure why Pela calls him unkempt. He looks like he smells like a fresh Spring meadow.

Fun fact: Gepard means "Cheetah" in German and is pronounced GAY-part

I don't like any other of the men. I play with Sampo because I feel sorry for him but he's just a friend
1. Kafka
2. Bronya
3. Natasha
4. Silver Wolf
5. Tingyun
1. Luocha, I'd die for that man
2. Blade
3. Jing Yuan
4. Gepard
5. Sampo and Welt

For the girls

1. Mommy Yukong
2. Bronya
3. Kafka
4. Himeko


It will be over for everyone(but Luocha) when Jing Yuan's Master is confirmed to be playable.
    "I'd die for that man"

Sushang: No real opinion on her - PASS

Tingyun: Pretty fox girl - Waifu

Yukong: Can't think for herself (As of now) - PASS
    Husbandos.  
Sexy Grampa Welt and Hair blowing in the wind thunder daddy Jing Yuan
1. PomPom
1. Himeko   
  
2. Kafka   
  
3. Natasha  
  
4. March 7th  
  
5. Tingyue
March for fun.

Asta if I was a gold digger or aiming to be a trophy spouse.

Dan Heng if I wanted to wake up and trust that the house didn’t burn down over night.
Qingque > Luocha > Welt > Sushang > SW.

I do not care for anyone in the game other than those 5.
March 7th 
Kafka no one else 
Seele was good but story in later part changed my opinion.
Idk but like hear me out… all the stelloran hunters… plus Natasha and possibly tingyun (Gepard is up there)
1 - Blade (Absolute edgelord) 
2 - Bronya (She's cool af)
3 - Welt (Gigachad grampa)
4 - Stelle (She's funny)
5 - Clara (She's cute and innocent)
Qingque is the most relatable person in the game for sure.
