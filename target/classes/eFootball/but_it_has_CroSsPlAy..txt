[[but it has CroSsPlAy.]]





Lol even pes mobile is better than this shit
eFootball now competes with Stick Football for the mobile market.
You literally have 10% of control over what your players do its mad ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
    Seriously, I feel like a passenger in this game. I have more control over my players in football manager
    For me the biggest thing is that when you hit 'change player' it takes a full half-second to switch, which throws me right off. I've since learned to take it into account and anticipate when I'll need to switch.

But with all the timing buttons right, it doesn't feel like I'm playing football, it feels like 'just a video game' if you see what I mean.
Could care less about the graphics ....it's the crap gameplay that's clearly been tailored for mobile ....well done Konami the one and only thing you always had over FIFA ...the actual gameplay you have butchered .....guess the days of having a good football game are finally over
And now 1 more year to maybe "fix" the game.
My disappointment is immeasurable
Game is booty cheeks.
    dont insult booty cheeks like that
1 month ago people be like: Yeah mobile can handle next gen physics and computation to match ps5

Good news for mobile gamers though
Can't even tell anyone I have played this shit without getting ridiculed. The player faces and abomination of animations are everywhere on Twitter. If it stays like this by any margin is going to be the final nail in the coffin for this joke branded as efootball
I don't even know what to say...
I played just one game, put the controller down and i thought...that is the next level of fifesque. Everything is stylized that way i think, but dressed in oversized older brother's things.
I'm not picky about details, just the hardcore, old school, Pes series gameplay fan.
This is some other dimension, the rules of which I don't really understand.
I would love to learn new commands in the game, but what happened to me while playing eFootball is a traumatic experience that will stay with me for a long time.
I can't find just ONE positive thing right now, and I remember a few, when the last time Pes changed the engine.
I have to congratulate the ignorants from konami for successfully finishing the Pes series on PS, xbox and PC.
The eFootball adventure is not for me, and neither is it for about 80% of existing players, so it's the perfect time to focus these ruthless, capitalist manipulators from konami on an underage clientele staring at their mobiles.
This is a very sad day for all of us (excluding konami members).
I could go on and on for a long time, but it's a waste of time, so I will continue another season in Master Ligue.
See you, maybe in another football simulation in some time, because other producers are not idle, fortunately for us.
Onto UFL now
I need to find users who said "don't worry, it won't be with mobile graphics, they got marketing wrong, WE WILL HAVE TWO DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THE GAME" and blah blah blah blah ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
    It clearly isn't mobile graphics. **That said**, it's annoyingly desaturated with bad lighting and also badly scaled to different hardware. I can't buy a fucking PS5 for almost a year now, so I'm playing on PS4, it's dropping frames like hell. There's no excuse how badly they handled the visuals. Sadly, it looks like they simply thought that a full realistic lightning would be similar to what a camera without any color grading shows, but your eye is not working like that. And at least there should be a shitton of graphical settings to tune it to your hardware/liking. Also, the blue - yellow UI is atrocious, I had to stop playing after a few hours because of the bad framerate and the UI.
        Good news for you, itâ€™s dropping frames like hell on PS5 too.
    I've been looking for those people too. Strangely can't find them.

        You still doing this again? Because I keep responding to you, and you keep ignoring me, which I imagine you do the same to others so you can have this odd arrogance to your posts.
    I don't recall people saying two different versions , just that the graphics will take advantage of each hardware differently. In terms of the graphics, I honestly don't think they're bad , just not as good as they could/should have been.
Is there player trading in efootball 2022?
    No. Right now, there is only pain.
        this comment. this comment right here ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚.
I wouldn't have discovered PES if it wasn't for mobile, but seeing the disaster that is eFootball, I'll just stick to playing my modded PES 2017 in my laptop than play this if it doesn't improve.
Mobile games actually work properly.
Maybe they let Iniesta and Pique make programming of the game to...
Konami being Konami
Most probably is like 2 weeks of development.
Need 2 more 2v2 0243 6424
