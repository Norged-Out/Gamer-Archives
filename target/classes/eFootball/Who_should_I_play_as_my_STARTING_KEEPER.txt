[[Who should I play as my STARTING KEEPER]]


I only have this two with the standard courtios card and Dibu ( this weeks potw card who I find very very disastrous)...... I am having a difficult choosing who my starting keeper should be?


Just noticed they forgot to blur the Turkish airlines logo from the UCL

Better go with lunin as your main keeper. Navas might have 97 reflex but that combo of 185 height and low reach will be detrimental.
    LUNIN IT IS THEN
    What about potw donarumma?
I’ve tried Lunin multiple times and he isn’t the best keeper sadly
    Way better than navas imo. Navas is literally tiny compared to other gks and he has way low of jump to compare with Sommer. 

I fear nothing. But Navas's height. It scares me.
GP Courtois better than both!
Kylie's hight is are around 165
    Minogue ?

    I saw the exact message while watching UCL 😮‍💨
    Ofcourse why not, looking forward to play you bro.
I have played with Navas and he dosent feel great at all
Kobel hands down!
Bro just use kobel
    Standard Kobel?
        Free kobel
            You can get from the daily penalty shots
            Haven't gotten that card yet
Trust me, your best option will be standard M. Neuer GK1-5, GK2-8, and GK3-10. You have the money, it should really help you, I am F2P too and I understand, if you do try it, please let me know how he does!
    Do you want to get scored on from shots in the middle of the pitch? Because that's what happens when you put Neuer in the goal.
        Sorry, but THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN FOR ME XD, I think you just have a bad build. I start with Neuer since this season unless he is below average condition in division and bud brought me \~40 points to divison 2 already though I have to study a lot as a student so I can't even play that much.
    Wont be enough against top cards striker...
        You don’t say, but what other best options do he has? He seems like a coin-poor F2P
    Shitty GK awareness.
        85 awareness is great and more than enough since it is Neuer. How do you know if you never tried it? I played him as first GK this season except when he is in bad condition and I didn’t even play a lot yet I got in top 100000 already
