Kim is too short for CB. Move Godzilla to CB and put Kim as RB (invest your progression points on ACC and passing). 
Is Thanos hole player or classic no. 10?
    I disagree. I would remove one attacking mid and move kim as a DMF. I think he has the blocker skill and in the mid field that's critical to have, IMO.
        no chance, id personally put him in goal and let saitama defend- just my preference though
            Fair enough
    Thanos is a Creative Playmaker, bro. Contrary to popular belief of being a Destroyer.
Another team with haaland
Actually funny.
Donâ€™t use the same players everyone uses, there are a lot of fun hidden gems. Iâ€™d suggest Frodo, Venom, Darth Maul, the guy from Predator, the guy from Doom, a Russian girlfriend, and if you have a 5 nomination contract get Jesus Christ. For coach, if you play Possession use Pazuzu, if you play Quick Counter use Napoleon. Good luck.
    Noob advice, Jesus base card is much better than nominating contract and it only costs your soul
    For the coach I do say Hitler. But hey it's just my opinion.
        Yeah, but Konami doesnâ€™t own the right and itâ€™s under a fake nameâ€¦.can you guess which one?
    Luffy is also a pretty good shout over Haaland
    Which guy from predator?
        Arnold
            I think Danny Glover from predator 2 is a hidden gem.
Ok, this is the first time I laughed with a meme from this sub. Good one dude.
Haaland tho hahahahaha
    He's the real punchline.
This is the best efootball meme I've seen yet!
Kim has pinpoint Launchers.... Would suggest u to move him in LB/RB for shooting in missiles for Haaland to head it in.
Vader in cdm? Really? Mans got like 30 pace and no mobility.

Same thing for gozdilla rb, you're much better off playing it as cb bcuz of his height and physicality.
Basically hes like rudiger but better.

If you got him, try out yoda as AM. He will literally force push opponents off the ball and has great mobility. Maradona who?
    This man makes sense ðŸ‘†
    I'd get Optimus Prime at cdm, personally. Intercepticons everything.
Well with saitama as goalkeeper you will never conceed again
We should support brainless posts like these lmao, much better then the b*tching
Imagine the face of guy who was going to create a post to ask how to improve his team
Content quality v.2.03
This entire sub represented in a single post. Well done.
Try to get the ones from Shaolin Soccer
By the end of the year, Konami will maybe release these cards after Neymar Super Sayien
    Saving all my free coins for it!
Who need other players?  
You use Saitama as GK and he can block all incoming attack. Then he can do single throw or kick ball direct to opponent goal with full power. Done. Other players can sit and relax on pitch.

&#x200B;

Just make sure, no sale advertisement on stadium. It can disturb his concentration, especially with 90% discount on it.
Needs Jon Snow at center mid
    He don't want it.
    He doesnt want to be #10 broooâ€¦
        Itâ€™s because (wait for it) we donâ€™t get snow yet in game lol
Tell me why you dont have Neo at winger
Great team. Also kim is enough for CB(if i speak I'm in trouble).
Quality shitpost :))
LMAO
Where's the ultra rare legend Joe Biden?
Lmaooo one punch man at GK is brilliant. He's punching any cross or shot attempts clear out of the stadium
Footnite
Iâ€™d suggest putting Gandalf as CB - the â€˜you shall not passâ€™ trait is OP
W8 for legendary Hitler and put him instead of Haaland
    Would probably be an overly aggressive CDM.  

Mussolini for RWâ€¦ or just get the real RW Mussolini thatâ€™s available in the game (the dictatorâ€™s great grandson).
Man you forgot MbappÃ© 100 rating /s
Missed opportunity to put Super Buu up top.
Joke's on you we have 102 rated players now.
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
I miss sauron
Sauron upfront
Buy coins for exodia lol
Should have cod characters since PSG players will be there in cod
right lol.
Dude!! Cthulu is a great LB but the best CB in game
Very easy to improve. Just change the left guy who can destroy mountains with Vegeta that can destroy planets...
Most of them are more like "I'm just showing off my squad"
King Kong for Kim.
theres that one guy, who goes balls deep and gets every player and posts this exact thread...i dont know him by username but hes funny
Bahahhahaha, dam I laughed harder than I should ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Aahhahah
fuck, thatâ€™s me hahaha
No stalin no party
Konami could learn from this and make sone game modes to accommodate this kind of fun.

Remember the penguins, raptors from PES.

Having actual character models in the game that resemble these characters and special skills that go with them would be amazing. It would also differentiate the game from EAs monstrosity.

I'd happily spin for a neo who could pull off bullet/ball time.
HAALAND IS ALWAYS THEREEE
Just need the missing 12th player - The referee
You should add "Donald Trump" as a Winger. He is Dodging CIA and FBI and running his Campaigns successfully. Defenders wouldnâ€™t even have a chance.
Saitama at goal feels like a mistake with how easily distracted he gets, I would switch him Naruto for his clones and energy level or maybe Vader, nothing is getting past Vader.
I disagree. I would remove one attacking mid and move kim as a DMF. I think he has the blocker skill and in the mid field that's critical to have, IMO.
