[[Neymar can do whatever he wants in Efootball 2022]]





Lmao this game man.

I was hoping he would walk the ball into the net and it would count as a goal, but what happened was even funnier
is this eAmericanfootball?
    eHandball
        EHandegg
Of course he can. He is one of the ambassador of efootball
assist of the year lol
This is the true embodiment of the saying (the pitch is ours), so we do whatever we want with the foot or the hand
Ebasketball hahahah
I remember roughly 10 years ago when FIFA switched engines and PES players lost their shit about the funny bugs. Well that's karma coming back to bit you in the ass.
    EA is worth 8 times konami, thatâ€™s way funnier
    Nah. I play both ef22 and fifa22, and the latter has way more bizarre glitches. Own goals from the other penalty box, goal keepers picking up freekicks before they are taken or using their hands 10m outside the penalty box and so forth.

That's not an excuse for ef22 which needs to improve, but pretending its more glitchy than FIFA is simply false.
        Man how delusional one can be.
            I know this sub loves to just rage against efootball but just play both, first 10hrs are free if you have xb sub. Or just check the FIFA sub and see the endless lists of glitches posted. 

Kinda disappointing to see how hostile and insulting this sub is whenever anyone refuses to say efootball is worse than Hitler. Yes, it needs work. No, FIFA is not more polished when it comes to their animation rigging system or weird glitches. Not that hard to accept. I currently play FIFA, waiting to see where efootball goes in the future. Doesn't mean I have to be tribal, pretend FIFA is perfect, throw a hissy fit or be a drama queen. When you play either you are gonna see glitches. Big deal.
                Fifa has a lot of glitches, but there's genuinely no way you think it has more than efootball...

Can't believe we waited 2 years for this garbage
    I don't think it's garbage. i laugh so loud !!! :-) so funny

2 years waiting for this is really worthwhile. so much fun in reddit and YT :-)
I had this bug happen to me once. But I canâ€™t remember how it ended. Not a goal.
Crossplatform, cross sport. Take THAT EA!!!
The best bug of all!!!
Damn, I love this game
This game is truly a masterpiece.

Konami, you...
How did you unlock the new skill for Neymar?ðŸ˜‰Is it available after today's maintenance?
    Pay the DLC dude
I can't believe  I found something  worst than my ex wife
Konami have made the best rugby game since Jonah lomu
lmao, he is using black magic in this game
but it's free!!!
OMG you just have to laugh!
lmao this shit can't be real
OMFG it's actually getting too much now jesus christ
Lmaooo
Hahahah!! And some people are still defending this game!! This is pathetic. Steam reviews are higher than expected IMO
How do you trigger that behavior? Or was it just a random glitch?
LUUUL
hahahahahahaha
From ewfootball to ewbasketball, neymar grew up
I would have to let the other guy score on me after all that, I just couldn't. I'd be embarassed lol.

Man was looking for hoop to do a three pointer but then settled for assist.
What DLC is this?
Thank you for this, I was having a good day, now it's turned out great and I can sleep with a smile on my face. Didn't realise efootball could be this hilarious, nothing like a good laugh before going to bed lol
Coming soon to the Toon too. And I cannat wait.
I am not sure, but I think this could be a bug. @konami: your thoughts on this?
I think they got the wrong football during development
I was expecting a skill show but this is genius
This is absolutely hilarious. And absolutely horrifying =)
This is just embarrassing from Konami.
Simply...WTF.
Laughing too hard rn
What a total shitshow. I have played PES for nearly 20 years and this is the worst state it's ever been in.
eHandball
