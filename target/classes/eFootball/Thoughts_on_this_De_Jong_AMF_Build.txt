[[Thoughts on this De Jong AMF Build]]





For amf definitely get the acceleration and balance higher instead of speed and stamina
    Thanks, I’m putting 12 into Dex instead now
        Idk if you need advice or not but in case you do, with pace my perspective is:

"Speed" stat is mostly for off-the-ball movement

"Acceleration" stat is mostly for getting the ball away from defenders to start a dribble, making space basically 

"Dribbling" stat is for how fast the player dribbles/moves WITH the ball

A good example of this is my POTW Haaland card vs Maradona. Haaland's speed stat is 92, but he's slow as fuck because his acceleration is 75 and his dribbling is 76. The only time he's fast is when he doesn't have the ball. Whereas my Maradona has a speed stat of 82, but because his dribbling is 97 and his acceleration is 92, he is fast as fuck.
It is hard to get a good balance and acceleartion on this card. Instead, try to get a decent CMF out of him. My build has 85 defensive awareness, 83 offensive awareness, 90 finishing, and 93 tight possession. Also, gave him aerial superiority, interception, blocker and long range shooting. He is the only one that offers such a high defensive and offensive effectiveness at the same card. Hole player style helps him to be in the box and make perfect runs with his deadly finishing and heading, while being solid defensively with 90+ tacking and interceptions. He is such a unique card. There are better AMFs than him in the game, don’t waste such a unique card by training him only offensively. I have tried epic Pirlo, BT Kimmoch, and showtime Bellingham there but they can’t offer a great balance between offensive and defensive duties that the de Jong card offers.
    I understand what you’re saying. I think his versatility and effectiveness in defense is actually why I want to use him at amf. I play a 4222 and want my team to enter a 442 shape when defending (like Arteta/Guardiola’s irl) so I need AMFs with strong defensive engagement and aggression. I was trying to use a combo of Gullit and ST Bellingham, but De Jong is actually much more suited for it than Bellingham imo. I also don’t like DMFs without play styles, so If I don’t use him at AMF, he won’t have a place in my team right now
        I use him at 4222, but I have one DMF and de Jong is CMF. It is actually like having 2 DMF in defence and 4132 in attack, because de Jong is capable of being both in the place of a DMF and a AMF. Try it for a few games, and see how he shines. Lack of balance and acceleration is not good for a pure AMF and even that tall Gullit is better than de Jong in those two stats. He will be wasted there.
too much lbs, would rather get that balance up
    Sounds good! Thanks
do you really need 98 low pass?

also, why force something that isn't there, he's best used at CMF. why don't you use a natural AMF at AMF? I'd rather use the free Songkrasin than de Jong at AMF
    He’s a 104 rated amf and very well balanced. I want AMFs that can contribute defensively and offensively in a 4222. So Im playing De Jong on the left and Gullit on the right behind Rumme and Messi. Considering this De Jong’s combination of finishing, heading, passing, dribbling, and defense, I don’t know how a player like Songkrasin could be better. I think this card would be Tier 1/S at AMF
        Nah, de Jong is 100% tier S at CMF, but at AMF he lacks acceleration, balance and dribbling, he's too stiff for that role

Not saying he'll be bad there, just saying that it's not his best role. Kinda like wanting to use Rummenigge at LWF. He can reach a 103 rating in that position, I'd rather just use the free Santos Neymar at that position, even tho his rating on the app can only get to 102 at LWF

If base overall ratings are already irrelevant, off-position ratings from the eFHUB app are 200% irrelevant
his stats looks way netter as cmf
I played a lot of games with this card as right cmf along with Viera, G.silva. 

He somehow doesn't live upto the stats in ball winning compared to G.Silva or Viera.

I also have no idea what high lofted pass Stat is supposed to do. The through lofted ball never works .

First two - three weeks were great. It is a good card but underwhelming for me. Iam considering spinning for matthaus
