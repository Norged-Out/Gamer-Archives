[[Would you actually want to be a prototypeevolved]]

So be able to shape shift, destroy anyone and anything, run up buildings, glide in mid air, be near indestructible to firearms and even nukes as well as being able to consume people and gain their form and memories not to mention immortality at the cost of being hunted by the entire world government and other creatures? I'm leaning yes
Eternal youth, shapeshifting, superhuman strenght, speed endurance and nearly endless stamina. You dont really NEED to kill people, even if you needed biomass food should do the trick
    Well. You need to be just like Barry. The flash. Eating a lot of food to compensate the energy he burn to maintain the speed n' shiieeet, like eating whales kinda thing.
        definitely but backdraft is that you would eat out the entire resources of earth within a few years if not months
            Well it's a sacrifice I would do for living üòîüëå
        The Prototype 2 comics showed that Mercer was able to live a normal-ish human lifestyle for a few years‚Ä¶ he probably couldn‚Äôt do a lot of the cool shit on that diet but he was still an immortal god thing.
    I mean in canon (from what I‚Äôve heard) Alex HARDLY killed innocents. Mostly like a trillion law enforcement but yeah
        Canonically he never killed a civ as like any sandbox game, freeroam is not canon and there is no mission where you need to kill innocents, except maybe gentek scientists in the secondary missions.


I was talking that maybe prototypes need biomass to sustain themselves, but both mercer and heller had a lot of soldiers to consume
            Gentek Scientists don‚Äôt actually count as pedestrians and neither do web of intrigue targets as canonically they are affiliated with both Gentek and Blackwatch which Mercer holds both responsible for the creation of the Blacklight Virus.
There‚Äôs not many downsides to being a prototype. You could probably live off a normal human diet if you really tried to. Alternatively, walk into a forest and eat some trees. You‚Äôll get all the biomass you could want without the pesky morality issues of eating people
Freaking amazing powers at the cost of no longer being eligible for blood donations? Fuck yes!
    I'd donate blood to see what would happen
        You know exactly what would happen üòÇ
    Wait‚Ä¶ since Mercer is the embodiment of the virus wouldn‚Äôt that mean he can no longer have sex with people without killing them through infection???
        Not according to Prototype 2 and its comic issues.
        Maybe? Depends on how thorough his shape shifting is. If all it does is LOOK like what he‚Äôs shifting into but isn‚Äôt actually then he would kill them. But it‚Äôs mentioned that he‚Äôs shifting his very DNA which implies a level of fine control. So it‚Äôs iffy, but I‚Äôd say possible if he isn‚Äôt careful
Well. Evolved are just zombie's with "a brain" but still can't be good as Heller or Mercer.

So, I want to be like them not just a copy like the evolved
    Well I think canonically the Evolved are just Prototypes Mercer created with only one power being given to them but with no training other than performing espionage attacks against Blackwatch and Gentek.

We see an evolved named Roland (I hope that‚Äôs his name. He‚Äôs the blonde guy that thinks calling Heller stubborn is an insult.) develop the ability to be undetectable through Mercer‚Äôs viral senses but acts as a double agent to stalk Heller and rogue Evolved for Mercer until you kill him. 

So it‚Äôs been established that Evolved can be just as strong as Mercer or Heller if they weren‚Äôt solely taking orders from Dr. Micromanager Mercer.
        Well. You have a point but, I think Mercer gave them the virus like it was Coca cola Light, in a minor dosis so they can resist the virus in their body.
But for Heller is another thing, because he has that unique DNA so he absorb better the virus than the others evolved, that's why Heller is transformed in a runner or Prototype like Mercer.
            We can‚Äôt say for sure because when Mercer infected Heller, Mercer chose to withhold any powers other than enhanced strength, speed and consumption. Heller had to go out of his way to consume beings far more developed than him in most cases. He even gets the blade and whipfist from two high ranking Evolved.
        He was undetectable to Galloway‚Äôs tracking abilities. Heller was too. Alex‚Äôs tracking abilities don‚Äôt seem to be as easily hidden from. Multiple times throughout the game he‚Äôs been able to find heller whenever he‚Äôs wanted to. So it hasn‚Äôt really been established that an evolved can get as strong as a prototype.
            My point is the Evolved have the same potential as Prototypes but simply aren‚Äôt able to live up to their potential due to the frequency of their operations.
                What makes you think they have the same potential?
If i start out with the bundle Heller gets in normal life theirs no reason for me to have to kill anyone, i can just amazon any interesting animals i want to consume and live life free of any injury or illness and the security of knowing i can yeet a truck a few city blocks along with any powers i drive from amzoning bugs and fish and stuff.

if i wake up in NY during prototype 1 or 2 with Hellers starting powerset, I'll basicly ignore blackwatch, consume any infected that can grant me powers, then nope out and leave it to alex or heller.

if i'm replacing Alex, then i kind of have to follow the plot until the first supreme hunter fight, then i make sure to consume EVERY SINGLE DROP OF IT. then i deal with Greene and dont become a homicidal maniac. something very simmiler if i am dropped as heller.
And I also would turn everyone into evolved. Well,all who survive transformation.

 It is the right thing to do,our race would make significant progress if we don't have to deal with accidents, diseases or death.
    Mercer was likely able to create Evolved by changing how the virus in his own body reacts to other beings. Elizabeth Greene had the unique ability to create any disease on demand with any specifications required so that scene where Heller orders the Blackwatch soldiers to test release Whitelight demonstrate the sole purpose of Whitelight which for lore reasons was only meant to create Evolved, which is proven due to Heller‚Äôs quote: ‚ÄúFuckin‚Äô Hell, imagine if Gentek had released all this Whitelight, the whole city would be crawling with Evolved.‚Äù
If I were to choose the power set from anything at all, prototype is my number one option!
No.
Doctor visits would be a tough situation
Third option. While all the powers are super cool, I‚Äôm a 19-year-old college student with the emotional maturity of a Mogwai. I wouldn‚Äôt trust myself to use those powers responsibly, especially because I‚Äôm living through a financial struggle at the moment. Someone more mature than me could probably use these powers more effectively while maintaining a relatively normal life. Personally, I still have some issues to work out. All my life I‚Äôve felt weak and deep down I would probably want to take those powers, but I also understand that it most likely wouldn‚Äôt end well.

Also, I‚Äôm interested in martial arts. I used to do Brazillian Jiujitsu, and I‚Äôm thinking about starting Muay Thai. I wouldn‚Äôt want such an unfair advantage over the other fighters. A simple punch could be someone‚Äôs head if I don‚Äôt know how to control my power or get ahead of myself. A simple rear naked choke could break a neck.

TLDR: it‚Äôs not a matter of whether or not I like the powers, but whether or not I could use them responsibly and with a great degree of control.
If I had the choose? Maybe. If I didn't then I would probably choose Evloed. Let's face it. 98% of us ain't becoming prototypes, rather take my chances as an evolved then potentially resist and die by the virus as most of mercer turns were willing. Besides. I don't need to technically get in Heller way, and some did exist after Alex defeat.It seems normal citizens were turned possible due to good potential/guards needed so was normal marines and blackwatch.  After Alex defeat and if I'm able to resist the hive mind like others I just live in NYC and consume on blackwatch not like they like us anyway.
