[[Are prototypes and evolved immortal or they still age just really slow]]





My theory is that they age proportional to the biomass they consume and store within their forms. If this is true, when Alex ate the blackwatch soldier in the cutscene in the beginning mission his lifespan would’ve gone up about another 65-80 years. Blacklight was designed to replicate and assimilate at a molecular level in order to reshape itself into a more efficient form. The reason Alex couldn’t regenerate in Murder Your Maker was that he lost too much biomass when fighting Heller which prevented him from regrowing his blade or other powers when they were separated from him. If you think about aging it’s really just your cells losing efficiency to replicate and your telomeres on your chromosomes shorten with each duplication. Consuming a whole other human would assimilate their lifespan as well as every other benefit a Prototype would receive. Now apply this to every canonical consume Alex performed, this includes web of intrigue targets too.
Prototype artbook says that mercer and supreme hunter don't age
    Glad someone pointed this out. They’re 100% virus. Wouldn’t make sense if they aged since they no longer function the same way humans do.
        Yes, this is tragic, but heller is doomed to eternal life until his daughter grows old and dies before his eyes
As long as they have access to biomass, they should be functionally immortal
    Yeah that seems to be the case as Elizabeth Greene survived what? about 40 years with no aging effects? It's pretty odd to say the least
I'd say they're immortal since they can probably stop telomeres shortening
For a while we assumed they were because Greene was, then the guide stated they are but I'm still iffy on that one. I was about to say what reaver said about them extending their life by absorbing others
    greene has no ability to consume at all, but was immortal, I don't think it matters
        Eh, runners and prototypes are different so they could work differently
            guide says otherwise
By aging, you mean Alex not turning old right? Because once they get infected by the blacklight, they're current age halts or something yeah?
According to game cut-scenes, dialogue and the Prima Guide they are immortal, unaging, not only their cells do not age or degrade but also seem to be capable of generating more with little to no extra biomass.
I think they age based on what form they are shaped currently into.
I'm pretty sure as long as they have biomass near them they're immortal
