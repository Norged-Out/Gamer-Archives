[[Ask Gaming Can anyone give me a REAL review of Prototype]]





I finished it yesterday. This post will be full of spoilers. 

Gameplay: Amazing. It is tons of fun to just run around destroying shit. The powers feel powerful. Skyjacking helicopters is tons of fun. Problems though. In GTA games it's fun to run around and explore because everything is different and exciting, and there's some pretty cool locations. Prototype though.. well when you can run and glide everywhere in the entire game there is nothing to explore. I'd compare it to the katamari games. You start off really small scale, and explore the levels. But then you get huge and roll up the entire levels. It feels like you start off huge and there's nothing to explore. Next issue is the chasing and running. Escaping bad guys is EXTREMELY easy regardless of what the reviews say. The worst thing that can possibly be sent after you is a bunch of helicopters. Problem with that is you are in a city full of skyscrapers and helicopters can't see past skyscrapers. E.g. run around a building, change disguise, boom you've escaped. Knowing this it's easy to just run into a base, kill things, run away, change, rinse and repeat. Not fun.

Graphics: The graphics are fine. Don't let the reviews lead you off on this. I had no problem with them. Quantity over quality, oh well. The animations are very good.

Storyline: Absolute shit. It's been done a million times. You're playing, and blowing shit up, and then storyline happens, and you find that it doesn't really matter at all. Plot twists happen, and you say "Eh. Who cares".

Mindless killing is certainly fun. To a point. There are VERY few types of enemies in this game. There's a tank (variations), a helicopter (variations), hunters (no varations), a big hunter (same as the small ones, just more health), infected civilians (no threat whatsoever), super soldiers (cool idea, but they're as easy to escape as anything else, and there is little point in killing them on the missions).

I think all of these problems wouldn't have bothered me if it weren't for the difficulty level. I play games all the time. And I always start on the hardest difficulty possible. The problem with this game is the difficulty is extremely high on normal. This is probably enough to turn most regular gamers away, at least a little bit. The other problem was the bosses.

Halfway through the game you fight a supreme hunter. Cool fight, very hard boss. 3/4 of the way through you fight mother (as seen in the trailers). AWESOME fight. Took about 30 minutes without dying to finish her off. But the problem came at the end of the game. Last boss fight was just another supreme hunter retextured. Not cool. Not fun. A game with this amount of destruction should finish on a high note with a huge battle. No fight through the city. No enormous boss. Just a boring fight. Very disappointing.

Aside from everything I've said so far, I really didn't mind the game. I'm not a collector, I sped through it in about 8 hours. I still recommend this game (surprisingly) but don't expect playing through the storyline to be the meat of it. Just have fun blowing shit up. And expect nothing more.
    This actually sounds exactly like my kind of game. I'm the type of person who picks up GTA and then spends two hours driving around, exploring, and finding new ways to kill things and not get arrested. I'm not a huuuuuge story plot kind of person, being raised almost exclusively with online multiplayer games. Just running around and killing things makes me happy. When there is a story, such as the aforementioned GTA, I tend to get sidetracked with the mindless killing and forget all about the story. An eight hour story might end up taking 20-30 hours for me, haha.

I'm going to wait maybe two or so more days, until the hype has died down and reviews are solid, then I'll purchase it. I mean, worst comes to worst I can resell it as used. Besides, with all the updates that come out these days, maybe they'll release a huge game-changing patch? I can hope!

Thanks for the review!
I do not understand how the word "Crackdown" has not appeared anywhere in these comments yet.  Is the game not comparable?
I'm very interested in purchasing Prototype; however, I do not really have money to be risking on a potentially boring game. 

I've been following Prototype for some time, constantly anticipating a demo and/or review. Those did not arrive, which has come as a shock to me. I can only assume that the pre-game reviewing and demos were not allowed due to it under-preforming and not living up to anticipation and expectation. My only source of "review" of prototype, so far, has been 4chan's /v/ section, which is basically a bunch of XBox 360 fans and PS3 fans arguing over which is better. I'm sick of hearing people bash Infamous or Prototype just because it is a PS3 exclusive, a multi-platform, or a rival-game. There are no real reviews in there.

I'm basically looking for someone to tell me whether Prototype is fun, if it's actually something to spend the $60 on. I saw IGN's review of a 7.5, but I refuse to believe that. They don't seem to have the most reliable reviews. I trust you guys much more.

How is the game play?

How are the graphics, which I understand aren't too great (I don't mind too much).

How is the story?

How is the just mindless fun killing, even without concern for the story?

How is the game overall?


You need not answer all, just give me what you think of Prototype. I really want this game, but, as I said, I can not risk money on something that I'm expecting to be vastly superior than it actually is.

Thanks!



Edit:

Why are you guy downvoting this thread? :[


    I've been playing it for a while, so I can add a few things here.

Game play is fun if you enjoy sandbox games.

Running up buildings is amazing at first, but loses its appeal fast.

The graphics are actually awesome, but keep in mind at some points there can be like 500 people on screen, so they are simplified in terms of npc models.

The story is interesting so far, I've been taking it slow and have only gone into the story about 3 hours worth.  The rest of my time has been spent mindlessly slaughtering every single thing that gives me experience so I can gain more abilities.

Mindless killing is great, but just like anything in excess, gets boring.  When you develop a lot of abilities to kill people in different ways, it brings back flavor.  

Also, when the monsters begin to come out to play, it adds a degree of challenge that makes you actually want to progress.  Humans are one shot kills after some abilities are learned.

I'd say the 7.5 is accurate.  It's fun, it's awesome for a while, but it isn't going to be Halo 3 or Gears 2.  Worth a rent.


    It's made by the same people that made Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction for the original Xbox. Everything I've seen of it so far indicates that it is exactly like that game in every way, just replace Hulk with some generic bad guy wearing black.

It's likely that lots of buildings will be completely destructible, lots of people will be completely killable, and you can use enemy vehicles against them as weapons. In IH:UD, you could grab tanks and whip them around at helicopters, or you could ball it up and throw it down a street as if you were going bowling. You could jump on top of a five story building and stomp on it until it went down, or you could run around on the bottom punching the sides in and breaking it's support. Very sand box type game play. It was one of my favorite games simply because it never got boring for me. There was always a new way to beat someone down that I hadn't tried, a new tank or car to throw at the enemy, etc etc. 

If sandbox type games that aren't strong on the story(I'm assuming) aren't your thing, rent it or wait till the price drops.
        I wouldn't buy it because I have Hulk for PS3 and I was bored after a while... not my style of game...
            If you mean the [movie tie in game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Incredible_Hulk_\(2008_video_game\)), then they are completely different games.  I played it on 360 and it was mediocre.  [IH:UD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incredible_hulk_ultimate_destruction), which the GP is talking about, is awesome.
            Completely different game, man. The movie tie in is just another generic title. 
    Seeing as how most stores usually get it a day or two after the official 'launch', and the fact that most gamers who DO have it are going to be wrapped up with it, I would say you have a few more days to wait.

I wouldn't worry though. For a game this hyped, there is sure to be plenty of conversation here about it in the weeks to come.
    I'm with you, I went and bought a game the day it came out.  Just so happened that was the first time I had heard about it too.  The game was Sacred 2: Fallen Angel.  It looked like it may have been a good dungeon crawl game on the 360 and I went and bought it even though I had not heard anything about it before.  I'll never do that again.

It was the worst game I have played in a long time.  I tried looking around for some prototype reviews for you and came up short.  I'm really looking forward to this game as well.  I'll wait a couple of weeks to get some reviews out.  Do you have anywhere near you that you could rent it from to give it a shot?  That's an option.
    You know, you could just *acquire* it to give it a test run.
Trusting one review is foolhardy. Metacritic is the best way to go. Game devs, and especially publishers, follow that more than anything else.

But I worked on the game. I can tell you that if you want to feel like a certified bad-ass and blow shit up, this is your game. It caters to anyone who has ever had a daydream of being a superhero, and adds a hell of a lot of violence and blood.

    Ohh! Will you send me a free copy... for... test purposes?
        also

> if you want to feel like a certified bad-ass 

so that's a guarantee that the game comes with an official badass certificate?

if not, could you send me one please?

    Why do 3 ton trucks bounce around like they're made of cardboard? Was this game build on the Euphoria engine? Seems like the physics could have used a bit more optimization. 
        They could have optimized physics and they could have made the animation of him going up buildings more realistic instead of him just humping the building, but it's a fun game not a realistic game. It's definitely not a 10, but it has a ton of interesting game play aspects that warrants a rent for sure. I am definitely having fun with the pace. The controls are about as good as they could have gotten them given the huge array of possible moves/powers. 
            Oh yeah I'm not writing it off completely but it could have been a 10 if they spent a bit more time on it. 
    Our bonuses are based on the overall metacritic ranking. We had to beg and plead with the publisher on one game to round the 84.5 up to an 85% so we could improve our bonus :S

And congrats on finishing it.
Just wait...
Metacritic has it at 93 right now.

But that's sure to go down. I think it will be as good as inFamous. Good time to be a gamer...with Red Faction out as well it's tough to pick just one game.
    red faction is great. i rented it and i am now torn between which one of these 2 to buy.
    Metacritic isn't yet including ign's 360 score of 75 in its results for some reason.
This seems like a console centric game (what isn't these days) did you encounter any issues using keyboard and mouse controls or would you recommend hooking a 360 controller up to the PC to play? 
In my personal opinion, it plays pretty much like Crackdown or InFamous.  So if you like those games, get Prototype.  If you have not played those games, get one of them instead, they are both slightly better than Prototype.
I was quite blown away by some teaser trailer I watched a couple of months ago showing off some of the cooler gameplay mechanics. Ever since then I've been following the game and yesterday I finally got my hands on a copy. 

I'm a pretty big fan of open world games and spent countless hours playing GTAIV. Initially I was a bit underwhelmed by the graphics as is often the case a teaser trailer at low resolution will look worlds apart from the real thing at 1920 x 1200. 

The world lacks the polish of Rockstars Liberty City, physics leave a bit to be desired and whilst I've heard that both the games use the Euphoria engine Rockstar definitely put more effort into it's optimization. Big heavy objects bounce around as if they were weightless and the crash audio samples accompanying the havoc are a bit bland. 

The way the mission system and cutscene triggering works feels a bit unpolished too, the story tends to jump a bit over the place. Building a storyline around a sandobx type game must be quite difficult and this was a noticable problem that in the older GTA games but in IV they managed to really bring it all together.

Another gripe I had with prototype was that so far none of the buildings are really explorable and the whole games is really focused around running and climbing the buildings which is shittons of fun but it would be nice to be able to do both. 

Having said all that it's not all bad the superpowers are a lot of fun and hurling cars and air conditioners at helicopters or oncoming traffic feels pretty damn cool. The parkour aspect of the game is one that seems to be the most polished and most of that is handled pretty well. So far I've done a few missions but they seem pretty bland and running around the rooftops and fucking shit up seems much more fun. 

In summation it's not game of the year material IMO but perhaps could have been if more time was spent making the city more immersive fixing the mission flow and improving the realism of the physics. 

Probably won't be out for a couple years if it ever makes it to production. Could still be in testing, or could just be wanting to get public opinion before mass production.
