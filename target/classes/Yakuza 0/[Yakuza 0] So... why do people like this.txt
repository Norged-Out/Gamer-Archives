[[[Yakuza 0] So... why do people like this]]


I picked up Y0 on sale on PSN the other day and I'm really struggling with it so far. What am I missing? It just isn't good. I read up a bit on what people are saying about the combat, and most agree that it isn't the best (and it really isn't). But then... what's left? You do fetch quests and you fight. The world might seem lived in at first glance, but it's a shell. You can bump into npcs and that's it. You can enter a lot of buildings, but for what? There are a bunch of mini games, but if you offered me these on their own you couldn't pay me to play them. There are plenty of side stories, but these have been uninteresting both story and gameplay-wise. It's all fluff. 

The main story has been the most enjoyable part so far, though that isn't saying much. I'd probably like it more if the characters didn't spend so much time saying very little. I do like the extreme campiness of it all (I burst out laughing at the karaoke scene in the beginning). But overall I think it is just way too slow-paced. This isn't helped by the text boxes being really slow, either. I feel like they did this on purpose, too, to inflate the game's runtime. Again, fluff.

The camera is bad. The movement is bad. The sound design is bad. The UI is garish. The environment design is great, but held back by the PS3-level quality of the graphics (you can really tell this game was designed for both consoles). The localisation is BAD. The inventory system is clunky. There is no autosave. Really? Why? The game lets you try again from a checkpoint if you die anyway, so it's not like it creates any tension. It's just inconvenient.

Again, I can appreciate all the camp. Why do all these random people want to fight me? It makes no sense, but it's funny. You literally invest money in yourself to get stronger. That's hilarious. The aforementioned karaoke scene. The disco dancing was similarly entertaining (even if the accompanying mini game was shite). Other than that, though, I'm not really seeing a lot of things to like about this. It seems like the game is designed to waste your time rather than provide fun gameplay. 

The reason for this rant is partly that none of my friends would give a rat's ass what I think about a semi-obscure Japanese button-masher-rpg (or whatever you want to call it) and I just needed to vent my frustration a little, and partly to see if anyone else felt the same way at first, but ended up liking it. I'm pretty close to just deleting it and moving on to something else, but figured I'd check with the community first.

Sorry for the incoherent ramblings, I usually just lurk on reddit.


If it's not your cup of tea it's not your cup of tea.

Personally, I think the translation is great and the side stories are amazing (even if they don't exactly innovate in quest design) but if you don't like it...you don't like it. No matter how many people tell me how great Dark Souls is my opinion isn't going to change just because other people feel otherwise, this is true for everyone.
Its the MOST fun i've had with a game in 23 years, i picked up Yakuza 0 completely blind and found myself completely sucked into the game, since then i've put over 180 hours in it, and have played Yakuza Kiwami and Yakuza Kiwami 2 after for over 80 hours each, the combination of the refreshing, manly hand to hand combat (as opposed to the generic third person shooters with guns) with the best music i've ever heard in a video game before, a small city that isnt an empty wasteland filled with dead time, but is instead densely packed with super fun and sometimes bizarre sub stories that almost always teach a life story and minigames.

The story of Yakuza 0 is phenomenally good and is the only one to ever make me reconsider what exactly am i doing with my life, i'd say it has greatly changed my life for the better.

I like how the Yakuza games start off slowly and pick up BIG time later on instead of everything going to shit 5 minutes in, its more realistic that way for me, even with the slow start most Yakuza games start off with a bang (for Yakuza 0 the Dojima Family office gauntlet was mindblowing for a person that went in 0 completely blind)

So yeah, at some point people have to realize not everyone likes what you like and vice verca, what you see as "clunky and boring" i see as methodical and brilliant.

Some people LOVE games like FIFA and racing games, games i cant stand and wouldnt touch even if they paid me to, but i dont go there and say "what do you find about these games", its a waste of time, people like games like Fortnite, a game i played once and never touched again because i died of boredom, they aint bad games, they simply aint for me.

I've fallen in love with the Yakuza games from the first minute, so i'd say you either LOVE Yakuza games or you dont at all.

I forgot to say i LOVE the combat (and all the juicy, brilliant Heat Actions)

            Just mad that the games actually trash
            Calm down, this is about how bad the game is and I’m just agreeing.  Don’t get your panties in a bunch just because I’m talking sense.
                Yeah lets go to a sub where everyone supports the topic and then specifically shit on it yeah thats gonna go well.

If you have valid criticisms by all means share them but dont call the game shit or think that people are stupid for enjoying it. Fucking troll.

                            Why do people like this game.... Is not fire starting and if it is you are too touchy grow a pair of f****** testicles or ovaries and stop letting s*** like that get to you!

        > The tables are turning and people are now starting to see 

No they're not, lol, this wasnt a person that was a fan of the series and woke up one day and said this series sucks, this is a complete newcomer that took a chance and he didnt like it, as im sure happens every day with many many games, we get a truckload of newcomers that say they picked up 0 for the first time and absolutely fell in love with it, doesnt change the fact that the Yakuza games and the studio behind them gain traction in the West every day, the extremely dedicated community behind the Yakuza games aint going anywhere too, and crying about it wont change anything, soon enough the new age of the Ryu Ga Gotoku games begins, and Shin Yakuza is almost ready to be revealed to the world, in all its marvel.

Far as im concerned the only trash here is a little shit called psychedelic bee that has nothing better to do with his life but dwell in his mom's basement and vomit his filth in gaming communities he doesnt like, im in a gaming community i absolutely love, where are YOU though? Saw light and decided to come in?

Nice bait btw.

                >  I am what you call an expert and my gaming experience has informed me this game is bad.

Now if THIS isnt a sign of how painfully stupid this moron is, i dont know what is, i guess you cant help being mentally ill, but this is it for me tolerating your filth, now back to your cave shithead.

I guess games like Bloodborne that have been PSPLUS games also really needed those "extra sales" so Playstation made Bloodborne a PsPlus game to save it from having really shitty sales (even thought by 2015 it sold 2 million copies), why didnt i think of that!

Behold the logic of a true gaming master!
                    Lmfao, i fucking died laughing at the expert part.
                >uses Sega as a red flag

So by that logic, Bayonetta is a terrible game.

Nice logic.

You look like a hypocrite after that comment dude.

But hey the Yakuza games suck...
    I have been playing yakuza 0 and kiwami for a year and still not get tired of it. The epic music, brutal heat actions and if you master counter attacks it is very fun
Maybe you don’t like the game? No point in forcing yourself to play a game that you can’t get into.
    I mean, I've changed my mind about stuff before. But you're probably right.
> The reason for this rant is partly that none of my friends would give a rat's ass what I think 

To be fair we don't care either. I always find it weird when people come to reddit to complain how they don't like this specific thing that sub is about. If you don't like something as trivial as video game just move on, no reason to dwell on it.

Constructive criticism would be a good starter for a discussion but your post is nothing like that. 

Also it's pretty hard to take you seriously after reading this:

>The world might seem lived in at first glance, but it's a shell
    I mean, constructive for whom? The developers? I'll concede my post may not have been the most nuanced, and also, entirely unnecessary. I just wanted to get it off my chest.
        No don't apologize Reddit is a place for sharing and communicating and having discussions.
If he wants to make you feel bad about starting a discussion he can f*** off and get off at it Reddit!
    To be fair, the world is pretty empty. It seems like they just put a ton of civilians in it to make it seem lush but when you really look at it, there's virtually nothing to do. 

Mini games are cool for a while but I'm not sure why anyone would go out of their way very often to do em. 

Shops and restaurants are cool. I always found them pretty aesthetic but there's no depth to them. 

I actually really liked the sidequests aside from the chracter models which look ridiculous in comparison to the protagonists. 

Random encounters aren't really that interesting. It makes sense in a lot of other RPG games, getting attacked by monsters and stuff but.. Angry gangsters..? Rich guys..? Men In Black..??? After a while it just feels weird and unsatisfactory, especially because there's not really anything that comes after. They just apologize and go on. It's not like you killed them or anything so they can't come back, they just simply don't and you never hear from them again. 

Combat in 0 also kinda sucked. It's either painfully easy or awkward at worst. I think it really excels in crowd fights where our protagonist is mowing down guys, it FEELS a lot more fast paced than the one on one fights. There's more targets, your goal is to take all of them down. And you can freestyle how you wanna fight because if you miss or something, you're still gonna hit someone. The crowd of enemies is always acting in some way. You've gotta dodge, counter, grab, etc all according to the situation. Whereas in 1 on 1 fights, you really see how limited the A.I. is. Very small movesets that don't do much damage even on max. And there's no reason for you to do anything except spam the most effective way to beat them. My strategy is always just build heat (usually through gunshots) and then heat moves. 

I LOVED the story though. I've only played 0 and I'm on my way to Kiwami 1 but the story was amazing. At first I really didn't like it and wasn't sure how it could possibly get better but the way it starts out so slow and progressively delves into chaos is genius to me. I felt like the main story itself did best at making the world feel lived in, the threat of Yakuza lurking around and not knowing what they might do or who's watching is so exciting. Especially when Kiryu's manhunt began, you really end up feeling like the world is against you. 

But that's about it. Aside from that, the world as a whole is just.. Dull. There's not much mechanics to fill it in. Even if you use your whole arsenal, the fun just doesn't make up for it. You're surrounded by hundreds of people and the most you can interact with them is throwing money. The sidequests are all pretty samey in what you do although again, I actually really liked them. 

I absolutely love Yakuza 0, this game is insane. It's just something that gets a little uglier when you look to hard at it in my opinion.
The games are niche. Like, they're great for some not for others. I like them, but I dont ignore the flaws. Yes, combat is slow but it picks up, you cant brute force sub stories cause that sucks the fun, and real estate can be slow. But I like the stories, the characters, and I like the humor. Its designed to be tense but then has silly humor to calm down the situation. If the humor doesnt appeal to you, it doesnt appeal to you.

Again, it's not sacrilege you hate it. What is though is your title; dont belittle fans of the game.
If you don't like it just dont question. Its about taste and you can't like a thing by force.

Yakuza games are uniqe and masterpieces. This doesn't means everyone will like it.

From my end, why i adore Yakuza Games:

+ Every dialog is wonderful. 
+ Main Stories are always nice
+ Sub Stories is an amazing feature. Different from side quests. They have comedy, drama etc. They contain a real life. You witness ordinary problems of ordinary people or really absurd situations happenning in real life. They are just uniqe. Its like reading an amazing book.
+ Tons of stuff to do besides main game. Most of minigames are enjoy to play
+ Amazing battles.

For the points you mention:

+ Old engine graphics are not bad. They give an "arcade" look to the game, which doesn't make graphics bad.

+ If you don't want to encounter random enemies use items to avoid. They attack you beacuse this is the plot of all yakuza games. You are in an dangerous part of tokyo.

+ The things you find weired is a normal reflection of far east culture. 

+ Going one point to another thing is in all games. This is not a good or bad thing.

This game is not a button masher rpg. This game is not a classical type of open world.

etc etc.
    The games are actually pretty short, and it's designed for you to do side stories as you go fro. Point a to b. Like, it's why some side stories need you to do something else or screen transition.
        No don't apologize Reddit is a place for sharing and communicating and having discussions.

To each their own.

I'd say that y0 has a very slow start and even if you are skeptical at the beginning you might still want to give it a chance, but if you don't like it by the end of chapter 5, you are probably never going to, it's just not the game for you.
The game is definitely not perfect, but I felt like the problems you pointed out aren't as bad as you made them out to be.  At least from my experience, they never got to a point of frustration.  To each his own I suppose.

Also, I'm pretty sure the game tells you this, but you can actually speed up text dialogue by holding R1 + X.  

Anyways, everyone has their own reasons for liking a game, and mines had a lot to do with me growing up with East Asian Entertainment and JRPGs.  As a result of my personal background, a lot of the humor and stories that are presented in this game just easily clicked with me.

But yea, based on what you said in your post, I doubt what we say will even change your mind about this game.  I do wonder what kind of game you would consider to be good, though?
    God of War.
I picked it up because I like movies/games/books about gangsters, so that's the angle I came at it from; it's a story about Japanese organised crime and I like stories about organised crime so I'm gonna play through it to experience this story. I ended up loving it for everything that it is in addition to that. It's easily my favourite game ever, and that had previously been unchanged since Assassin's Creed II came out. But if you don't like it, you don't like it. Forcing yourself to play it is just gonna make you resent it. Maybe try again another time?
    I mean you're an assassin's Creed fan expectations from you should be pretty low already after that.
Didn't read. Bye.
    Oh you hooligan 😛
You're coming into this game is a horrible mindset my dude. This post is nothing but complaints and anger.

A couple tips in case you're just tilted and venting. Make sure you unequip the charismatic autobiography, that beefs up enemy. Set the game to a lower difficultly if you're having a ton of trouble with fights. Buy food/medicine items at the various stores in the game to heal yourself during fights.

Saying the localization is bad makes you sound pretty stunted though.
    It's not that it's too hard, just not very engaging. And no, I didn't come into it with a horrible mindset. I wanted to like it. I bought it, after all. 

I mean, the dialogue can be very unnatural at times, sometimes downright confusing. I guess this might be down to trying to stay as faithful to the original Japanese as possible, so maybe saying it's bad is a bit harsh. Still, not personally a fan.
        Dialogues are not unnatural. Its a different culture. Of course it will feel different.
            And a rather specific subculture as well.
Just a tip - you can press the X button on your controller while people are talking and the full sentence or whatever will be there instead of slowly appearing.
    Ah yes, I know. It's still pretty slow.
After reading all the comments this is my impression of a Yakuza game fan.

Hey I don't like you talking s*** on my game, how dare you talk s*** by asking questions and engaging in a conversation about a title that you don't like in order to learn more about the opinions of others and their love for it. How dare you use Reddit for the one thing it's meant for communicating and creating conversations!
    For real, this thread is embarrasing
        This is pretty much every single thread being critical of this series (despite a few IW ones, it seems most people agree IW was a let down). I like this series, i've platinumed them all except for LJ and ishin. I'm not a SUPER fan, but i like it enough to be interested in the reveal this year at the next summit or whatever but. The fans are hands down the worst part of this franchise, after its gigantic popularity boost on instagram and youtube with 0 back in 2020-2021 the only things i ever see being talked about in the community is how every single game is perfect and a "masterpiece" and you're not allowed to criticize them in any way or you will be insulted and told you just "don't get it". OR, the mouth breathers who just spout "huhuhuhu dame da ne guy huhuhuhuh" etc at any given opportunity. (to be fair they don't really harm anything it's just really irritating after seeing it for the 500th in a week. This fandom is legitimately kind of turning into the persona one, I just want a genuine conversation and critique of a given game, I'm so tired of trying to talk about something i did or didn't enjoy and having people just make constant excuses to excuse shit writing/gameplay elements or belittle my opinion because i don't think 0 or 6 are the best games in the series etc. PS sorry for the rant it's just i have nobody to talk to about this series i like outside of being insulted constantly
Game is amazing thanks for shitposting
Last HHSW don't apologize to this babies.

I agree. It's seriously overrated. It's just bloated with minigames, little voice acting, and poorly thought out mechanics. Ugh the minigames..mini games...

 I used to love Japanese games as a kid, but I'm so sick of the constant mini games. It doesn't matter if it's pokemon, final Fantasy, yakuza, or whatever. Every Japanese game has like 100 different minigames. If they focused half of that time they spend making mini games, they could make a much better game and not slow down the pacing of the game with bloat and boring, tedious, and unnecessary grinds. 

If Yakuza completely removed the budget and time spent making pointless minigames the likes of which you'd find in an arcade booth in some run down 1990s bar, they could spend that time and money better developing the combat system, voice acting (so sick of text - 80s gaming ugh), and a more engaging story.

But don't get me wrong, I really like the game. I just think like 50% of the fat could be trimmed and invested in other areas. Even making fewer mini games, but make them better. Like I wouldn't mind a bigger and longer circuit car system or even bowling. But fishing? Shogi and mahjong which I don't even know how to play and won't bother learning when it would take years to get good at anyway? Like come on.... couldn't you do voice Acting and a better combat system as opposed to freaking mahjong?

                    Who's laughing? I described what I don't like about the game. No need to get so defensive, it's not like I pissed all over your religious beliefs or anything.
I’m kinda feeling the same way… enjoyed like the first hour a lot (as I do with every game ever) and thought the majima opening was excellent, but besides that, I’ve felt like it’s getting dull. I like the story, but find the gameplay kinda uninteresting, might prefer if it was a tv show or movie series or something so I could get the story without playing it

I just reached the point where you and Oda help kick the squatter out for yamonoji… does it get substantially better after that? I have a friend who loooves these games, and the collection was on sale for decently cheap so I bought them all, but I kinda regret it now
Very late comment lol but what helps me when I don’t like a game is I leave it alone and revisit it a couple months or years later to see if my opinion changed
Im playing zero right now and I have to say I’m severely shocked at how bad this game is
"the characters spend so much time saying very little"

my primary issue with most Yakuza games
I hope people don't downvote you, it seems like you genuinely wanted to enjoy the game and are voicing your real criticisms.

I will say I agree with some of this, particularly the combat mechanics being pretty "okay", but fighting does get more complex and interesting later on. Though it never gets amazing.

For me the appeal is how the open world's side content all feeds into each other mechanically. In GTA games for example you could go bowling or play darts or do side stories, but why? In Yakuza 0, the Completion Points system means that literally EVERYTHING you do is contributing to progress, progress that you can use to purchase extremely useful upgrades. I found that insanely addictive.

Then there are the obvious other reasons the game is good: the story, the humor and insanity of it all, the music, etc.

I think you have to approach Yakuza in a particular way to enjoy it - the way the game was described to me before I started was as a crime-themed ANIMAL CROSSING game. That made so much sense to me and made me take my time and slow down to appreciate the relaxing side content a lot more.
    Haha, I'm not too concerned about downvotes, but I appreciate the sentiment. Yes, I really did want to like it, but it's just been a slog from the first second. To be honest, the whole rant was fueled by a long string of games I've played lately that have disappointed me, mainly by having SO MUCH STUFF, yet so little actual good content. Yakuza 0 was just the latest. I don't know, maybe I'm just expecting too much.

It's cool that everything you do contributes to something, but I guess it's kind of lost on me if I don't enjoy the core gameplay.

    God who shit in your cheerios
The funny thing is Yakuza 0 is the only one I really like so far.  I just finished Y3 and thought it was pretty much a waste of time.  Y0 had the awesome boss fights and great music to boot.  Overall though, I really dislike how over emotional every character is.  Every death scene is dragged out.  I get it, Kiryu, he was your pal.  But we really don't need to see a cutscene of you crying for 7 and a half minutes.  Maybe I'm cold but I'm trying to play a game, not watch a telenovela.
My friend picked up the games and started playing them I was watching him and let's just say I've lost a lot of respect for him.
The guy was falling asleep playing the game and every time I was like yo man you fall asleep he'd be like no no it's a good game it's really good game man...
To be fair, the best part of the game is the story. I  never even played Yakuza Kiwami 2, just watching all the cutscenes on YouTube alone felt like an exciting crime movie. The minigames didn't appeal to me that much but the story had me really engaged and made the game top-tier, for sure.

I feel like this is pretty common in Japanese games, at least from what I've dabbled with.
I just got stuck on chapter 2 walking around aimlessly kept getting told the same info that's no help what so ever love Yakuza as a series but Yakuza 0 can get to fuck along with kiwami 1.
People have different preference I don't know what's so hard to understand about that like there's no thinking involve at all lmao
I’m pretty sure this post is attacking not only on yakuza 0 but the whole yakuza franchise…
Yeah, the game controls like shit. But the story is a masterpiece. I hate the UI too, but it's supposed to be play like an old game, it's a very nostalgia based game, which understandably, can be pretty fucking frustrating, especially the combat, it's really bad imo, but it fills that niche of playing like something that came out two decades ago. If you don't like that, that's perfectly fine, I hate it, if it wasn't for it, I'd say this game would be the best game I've ever played, but the combat, camera, UI, the stupid way saving a game puts you through like 3 menus that takes God damn forever. But, the story... it's worth the pain.
    Honestly, wish it was just an anime. Minigames and side content is great too.

No they're not, lol, this wasnt a person that was a fan of the series and woke up one day and said this series sucks, this is a complete newcomer that took a chance and he didnt like it, as im sure happens every day with many many games, we get a truckload of newcomers that say they picked up 0 for the first time and absolutely fell in love with it, doesnt change the fact that the Yakuza games and the studio behind them gain traction in the West every day, the extremely dedicated community behind the Yakuza games aint going anywhere too, and crying about it wont change anything, soon enough the new age of the Ryu Ga Gotoku games begins, and Shin Yakuza is almost ready to be revealed to the world, in all its marvel.

Far as im concerned the only trash here is a little shit called psychedelic bee that has nothing better to do with his life but dwell in his mom's basement and vomit his filth in gaming communities he doesnt like, im in a gaming community i absolutely love, where are YOU though? Saw light and decided to come in?

Nice bait btw.

Now if THIS isnt a sign of how painfully stupid this moron is, i dont know what is, i guess you cant help being mentally ill, but this is it for me tolerating your filth, now back to your cave shithead.

I guess games like Bloodborne that have been PSPLUS games also really needed those "extra sales" so Playstation made Bloodborne a PsPlus game to save it from having really shitty sales (even thought by 2015 it sold 2 million copies), why didnt i think of that!

Behold the logic of a true gaming master!

You look like a hypocrite after that comment dude.

But hey the Yakuza games suck...
I have been playing yakuza 0 and kiwami for a year and still not get tired of it. The epic music, brutal heat actions and if you master counter attacks it is very fun
I mean, I've changed my mind about stuff before. But you're probably right.
I mean, constructive for whom? The developers? I'll concede my post may not have been the most nuanced, and also, entirely unnecessary. I just wanted to get it off my chest.

To be fair, the world is pretty empty. It seems like they just put a ton of civilians in it to make it seem lush but when you really look at it, there's virtually nothing to do. 

Mini games are cool for a while but I'm not sure why anyone would go out of their way very often to do em. 

Shops and restaurants are cool. I always found them pretty aesthetic but there's no depth to them. 

I actually really liked the sidequests aside from the chracter models which look ridiculous in comparison to the protagonists. 

Random encounters aren't really that interesting. It makes sense in a lot of other RPG games, getting attacked by monsters and stuff but.. Angry gangsters..? Rich guys..? Men In Black..??? After a while it just feels weird and unsatisfactory, especially because there's not really anything that comes after. They just apologize and go on. It's not like you killed them or anything so they can't come back, they just simply don't and you never hear from them again. 

Combat in 0 also kinda sucked. It's either painfully easy or awkward at worst. I think it really excels in crowd fights where our protagonist is mowing down guys, it FEELS a lot more fast paced than the one on one fights. There's more targets, your goal is to take all of them down. And you can freestyle how you wanna fight because if you miss or something, you're still gonna hit someone. The crowd of enemies is always acting in some way. You've gotta dodge, counter, grab, etc all according to the situation. Whereas in 1 on 1 fights, you really see how limited the A.I. is. Very small movesets that don't do much damage even on max. And there's no reason for you to do anything except spam the most effective way to beat them. My strategy is always just build heat (usually through gunshots) and then heat moves. 

I LOVED the story though. I've only played 0 and I'm on my way to Kiwami 1 but the story was amazing. At first I really didn't like it and wasn't sure how it could possibly get better but the way it starts out so slow and progressively delves into chaos is genius to me. I felt like the main story itself did best at making the world feel lived in, the threat of Yakuza lurking around and not knowing what they might do or who's watching is so exciting. Especially when Kiryu's manhunt began, you really end up feeling like the world is against you. 

But that's about it. Aside from that, the world as a whole is just.. Dull. There's not much mechanics to fill it in. Even if you use your whole arsenal, the fun just doesn't make up for it. You're surrounded by hundreds of people and the most you can interact with them is throwing money. The sidequests are all pretty samey in what you do although again, I actually really liked them. 

I absolutely love Yakuza 0, this game is insane. It's just something that gets a little uglier when you look to hard at it in my opinion.
The games are actually pretty short, and it's designed for you to do side stories as you go fro. Point a to b. Like, it's why some side stories need you to do something else or screen transition.

God of War.
I mean you're an assassin's Creed fan expectations from you should be pretty low already after that.
Oh you hooligan 😛
It's not that it's too hard, just not very engaging. And no, I didn't come into it with a horrible mindset. I wanted to like it. I bought it, after all. 

I mean, the dialogue can be very unnatural at times, sometimes downright confusing. I guess this might be down to trying to stay as faithful to the original Japanese as possible, so maybe saying it's bad is a bit harsh. Still, not personally a fan.
    Dialogues are not unnatural. Its a different culture. Of course it will feel different.
        And a rather specific subculture as well.
Ah yes, I know. It's still pretty slow.
For real, this thread is embarrasing
    This is pretty much every single thread being critical of this series (despite a few IW ones, it seems most people agree IW was a let down). I like this series, i've platinumed them all except for LJ and ishin. I'm not a SUPER fan, but i like it enough to be interested in the reveal this year at the next summit or whatever but. The fans are hands down the worst part of this franchise, after its gigantic popularity boost on instagram and youtube with 0 back in 2020-2021 the only things i ever see being talked about in the community is how every single game is perfect and a "masterpiece" and you're not allowed to criticize them in any way or you will be insulted and told you just "don't get it". OR, the mouth breathers who just spout "huhuhuhu dame da ne guy huhuhuhuh" etc at any given opportunity. (to be fair they don't really harm anything it's just really irritating after seeing it for the 500th in a week. This fandom is legitimately kind of turning into the persona one, I just want a genuine conversation and critique of a given game, I'm so tired of trying to talk about something i did or didn't enjoy and having people just make constant excuses to excuse shit writing/gameplay elements or belittle my opinion because i don't think 0 or 6 are the best games in the series etc. PS sorry for the rant it's just i have nobody to talk to about this series i like outside of being insulted constantly
He’s just airing out his opinion. That doesn’t make him a “dickhead.”
    [removed]
        You’re not this thin-skinned are you? So what? I’ve probably said something like this about things I didn’t like. OP is clearly disappointed and they have every right to be.
        Don't point words in his mouth. I may not agree with him at all but he is entitled to his opinion.
        I'm not insinuating anything. Different people like different stuff. *You're* probably an idiot, but not because you like Yakuza.
            [removed]
                Who's laughing? I described what I don't like about the game. No need to get so defensive, it's not like I pissed all over your religious beliefs or anything.
Haha, I'm not too concerned about downvotes, but I appreciate the sentiment. Yes, I really did want to like it, but it's just been a slog from the first second. To be honest, the whole rant was fueled by a long string of games I've played lately that have disappointed me, mainly by having SO MUCH STUFF, yet so little actual good content. Yakuza 0 was just the latest. I don't know, maybe I'm just expecting too much.

It's cool that everything you do contributes to something, but I guess it's kind of lost on me if I don't enjoy the core gameplay.
God who shit in your cheerios
Honestly, wish it was just an anime. Minigames and side content is great too.
What the fuck are you on about? Get out of here with your bullshit if you dont like it then. I dont go on Dark Souls subreddits to complain how shit that game is.   


(Note: I dont think its shit, just not my style of game.)
    Just mad that the games actually trash
    Calm down, this is about how bad the game is and I’m just agreeing.  Don’t get your panties in a bunch just because I’m talking sense.
        Yeah lets go to a sub where everyone supports the topic and then specifically shit on it yeah thats gonna go well.

If you have valid criticisms by all means share them but dont call the game shit or think that people are stupid for enjoying it. Fucking troll.
            Hate when people say this. Like where are you supposed to post it then?
            Did you read the title to the post?  It’s asking why do people like this game? Which infers he does not like the game.  I am simply agreeing with the OP to explain my point of view.  Anytime someone disagrees with a Yakuza lover they get tremendously upset and attack anyone with a differing option, even if the person who likes Yakuza games is wrong and should be ashamed of themselves for liking it.
