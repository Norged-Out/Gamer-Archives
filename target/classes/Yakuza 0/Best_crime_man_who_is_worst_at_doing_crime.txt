[[Best crime man who is worst at doing crime]]





Fuck these kids - kiryu who's won pocket circuit, twice
    Poor kids. Just cause they don't have billions of real estate money to spend on toy cars. Get wrecked, poor kids.
        Or they dont have a clown on the strert corner that gives them millions of yen worth of *p l a t e s*
            That isn't so much though. I would love for kiryu to put his gold statue in the racer stadium
                Its enough for thr start, you get more before getting the chance to buy the best parts
                    It's ok, i get it you are a fan of plates and/or clowns.

I actually have some cool plates from Japan at home. But i don't believe any pawn shop give me close.to.this much for it.

Also who wants to eat on a platinum dish. That shit is not healthy for you.
                        The dog in kiwami 1


^(can someone test if you can use it)
                            I believe it's a paper plate. Also dog eating from a plate come on now. Give him a fork too ,😉
                                I know u need a paper plate, but thats the one that most ppl get cuz its easy

But *do other plates work*
                                    The iron plate also works. I imagine that the rest probably do, too.
                                    You have the dog 🐶 pic. If you don't know, we are doomed
                            You in fact can use one of the pawnable plates  had one in my inventory when that happened and they let me use it no problem.
                Which reminds me, why couldn't Ichiban build a damn gold statue of himself to continue the, ah, tradition
        Don’t forget that Kiryu came back and did it again in a post-bubble economy too.
            I wrote that below
        it is canon that kiryu blew all his real estate money buying godspeed motors for less than fortunate kids
        That threw me for a loop, 100 mil for parts really, then just startin talking shit like "you ain't got that money bitch" to the little kids, while I'm on my 50th test drive for a course I can't beat. Love that mini game
        Stop making me feel ashamed!
I mean in the time between 0 and 1 Kiryu WAS legitimately shaking down guys that had taken loans from the Kazama family, but beyond that he's the least criminal Yakuza ever it's great.
    imagine me, a complete noob, going in thinking I'd be playing this morally grey outlaw engaging in reprehensible behaviour

Kiryu is literally the purest boi

even the people he shakes down, the games go out of their way to point out they're assholes
    I mean, he basically doesn't get what being "a Yakuza" actually means, he has this idealistic view of honorable outlaws fighting to live as they like outside of the normal limits of law, not ruthless violent mafia groups that shit on poor people rights. 

He was just punching people that Kazama asked him to punch.
        God forbid you go against his ideals though, because you WILL end up in a full body cast

Looks like you’re tonight’s big loser, the final boss in a yakuza game :)
            Now since Murr's tonight's big loser he's going to fight against Kazuma Kiryu the Dragon of Dojima.
    Ichiban is even more of a goody 2 shoes
        I was gonna say, Ichiban literally fights crime as a vigilante haha
    Least criminal Yakuza is a crime within the Yakuza 🤔
Yeah this is a very common trope when it comes to the Yakuza in Japan, you'll see it in a lot of Japanese movies.  They're supposed to be like samurai, be honorable and fight injustice (which in their eyes also includes gov and law enforcement).

In reality though they're just the mob.
    In reality they also beat up pedophiles and legitimately protect their neighborhoods in ways the police fail too. It’s not completely one way or the other. Definitely still criminals though
    [deleted]
        Not really. It's moreso Kiryu and Ichiban (and to a certain extent Majima, not so much Saejima who's just sort of 'naturally old-school') are basically people trying to emulate those romanticised ideals of being a protector for the weak that works outside the law, which in some way are basically the 'old noble ways' in the games that basically stopped being part of either clan when Jin Goda died and was on its way out as far back as 0. It's why 6 has such a big thing of the new type of Yakuza coming in, why 7 shows what the old guard does when its time is up, etc. Most other Yakuza in the games are more close to real-world Yakuza, pragmatic and efficient exploiters of the poor and the guillible, with a tinge of loyalty and honour and brotherhood still running throughout to make them LESS reprehensible (or more in some cases). Like, a LOT of the tropes of the Yakuza basically are pushed by real-world Yakuza to try and make them seem more 'friendly' and necessary than they really are. Even the games tend to acknowledge this, as the only good the Yakuza do for citizens seems to be keeping rampant gangs from going about, which is about the only real positive side to their existence in the real world, and even then they just tend to have a more organised system of fucking with citizens.
            “Basically.”
No wonder Kiryu gets imprisoned these stuff are criminal
I would have agreed before 7 came out. Ichiban makes Kiryu look like a criminal mastermind.
    “I am going to eat this tuna sandwich I found under a car”
        I’m crying laughing
        "Ichiban please don't eat floor food."
    I like how every criminal we play as actually sucks at being a criminal. Akiyama is the worst loan shark, never collects on any debts. Saejima is more-or-less trying to be reformed after prison. Majima seems to just have a legitimate construction company business going on on the side and makes most of his money from real estate? And Ichiban doesn't seem to do ANYTHING right about being a Yakuza.
        I mean Akiyama is in a legal grey zone but he has enough that he does not care for profit, it's very intentional with his values.

Ichiban's only Yakuza trait is being knowledgeable about the workings of a gang structure but it's something.
            His whole thing is "If I trust you enough to give you money, I can trust you enough to pay back your debt in your own time."
            G-Grey zone? 

Better hope Akiyama doesnt try and start Sky Finance in Ijincho
        Majima is actually Yakuza tho he rejoined Tojo after 2. We don’t really know what he does with his time and I think it’s safe to assume he does actual “Yakuza” things on top of Majima construction since everyone is scared of him. You don’t get his kind of reputation by being a softy like kiryu.

The way I see it they intentionally left majimas criminal side more vague because they hate showing the main characters do serious crimes for some reason. Remember Majima was literally gonna kill that one guy at the start of 1 if kiryu didn’t stop him, so imagine what he does when kiryus not around. He’s probably a REALLY BAD GUY but the writers make him likable by only showing him being goofy.
            Yeah, the thing with the Yakuza series is that beside the playable characters in 1-6, even the Yakuza members we're meant to root for are at the very least complicit in some really horrible stuff. You look at how Sohei Dojima was so seemingly respected by his underlings in Yakuza 2 despite being one of the most evil characters in the series and those guys are supposed to be the Yakuza that are on your side in that game. 

I think the "good" Yakuza in the series at their very best are just guys that have a strong sense of loyalty and honor but in the grand scheme of things are still really reprehensible criminals. I suspects that's partly the reason why we didn't get to play as Majima until much later in the series, I don't think the devs wanted us to emphatize with a character that is so violent and seemingly unstable despite his popularity. When we finally did get to play as him, we played a very different version to the one we already knew.
                > I think the "good" Yakuza in the series at their very best are just guys that have a strong sense of loyalty and honor but in the grand scheme of things are still really reprehensible criminals. 

That reminds me of  how 0 feels like it thought Awano was redeemed in the end for sacrificing himself for Majima and the honor of their fight, even though the rest of his life he enjoyed randomly murdering women, blackmailing people, and just beating in people's faces.
                I think Majima was intended to be the opposite of kiryu who never wants to actually do Yakuza stuff. Majima “crossed the line” that they kept talking about in Yakuza 0 but kiryu did not. 

Majima said in 0 you get to choose who you bring down with you, he knew which path he wanted to go down so he ditched makoto as to not drag her down to his level.

Nishiki was the same as Majima, he “crossed the line” when he killed that one guy and became worse and worse of a person after he did that even though he said in 0 if either kiryu or him crossed the line they would do it together.
                This! When I first used Daigo’s Poundmate summon in Like A Dragon I was like yo WTF is the first Chairman doing here, that dude is a rapist and his ghost should be in hell
                    Do you mean Dojima? We never get to meet the first Tojo chairman at all, and we only get to see the second's stand-in in 0. Dojima was trying to become the third chairman but >! Was beaten by Sera !<
            He does kind of mention some of his other business when he's dressed as Goromi. At the very least, we know he handles imports, including "some good Jamaican shit".

Let's just hope he's not also importing people.
        Also Saejima is in jail for a hit he messed up big time
            Man, the last half of Yakuza 4 is so lame. The strange requirement RGG seems to have for all their protagonists to be moral paragons means they had to write some real stupid bullshit to "redeem" Saejima.
                It is probably the dumbest plot twist in the entire series because it makes no difference aside from having the one survivor. He still had the intention and performed the act so it doesnt change how we feel about him at all.
                When I first got to saejima's story in 4 I was psyched to actually play as a murderer. The colloseum scene was really tense as unlike Kiryu, you were led to believe that there was a very real chance saejima would kill the guy. What happened next was one of the best moments in the series.
        Ironically, the most criminal protagonist you play as is Tanimura, lol.
        Akiyama was never a loan shark
            Why are you replying to a 3 year-old comment.
        Ichiban gave up on being yakuza after founding out he did time for no reason
    >!He literally gave money to the person he was supposed to shake down.!<
        Sorry, you gotta be more clear. You said you wanted his wallet.
            I honest to God died laughing at that part ngl
        Ichiban is just bad as his job.

Bering in the yakuza somehow makes him nicer given his backstory.

Also how are Assassin's apparently the best dad's in yakuza. We are 2 for 2 now
            Lao Gui would have been a bad ass dad if anybody was willing to touch him
                Maybe chinese market lao gui. Who looks a bit like shibusawa
                    Yeah, Chinese market Lao Gui looks like a normal human being and not a demon.
                        Although I don't think that's so bad. Some times having a fucked up guy look fucked up is the point. Maybe it's just me. But being German i think it sucks that wolfenstein games still get censored here. Why would anybody be offended, it's just fiction and swastikas were part of the Nazi regime.

We learn that shit in school in atleast 3 different classes till you can't hear it anymore. But then they censor it in games.
                            I mean the Yakuza series, because of Japan's complicated history on race ethnic relations, does demonize foreigners a decent bit which I think can be problematic in some cases. With this issue, I'd say the real problem is that the character looks so much like an evil caricature that he doesn't really fit in.
                                Agreed on all points. Well explained
                                Yeah it was a nice change of pace that the Geomijul and Liumang just look like regular people. Instead of how Yakuza generally puts every Chinese character in a flowing jade robe and every Korean character is a J Pop idol. They’re trying to do better, at least?
            3, wasnt koichi from 6 also a mega assasin
                Didn't play it yet. Also dude my post is 5 months old.
    Kiryu has a delusion about yakuza being this honourable organisation

Ichiban SEES DRAGONS
    Also, Kiryu’s a virgin but just from one game, canonically, Ichiban FUCKS
        kiryu also canonically fucks
"It's like a Japanese GTA."

I shed a tear everytime I think about the times I heard this before playing Yakuza. To begin with, the gameplay is massively different but more importantly every GTA protaganists is a psychopath and Kiryu is a cinnamonbun.
    Like MAYBE Niko is probably the only GTA protagonist who isn't a complete shitstain but the gameplay still goes way against that.
        Even CJ, the friendly neighborhood gangster, had his psychotic moments.

Kiryu, at worst beat, the guy at the beginning of Yakuza 0 to an inch of his life. Heck, even while loan sharking, he seemed to only collect from crooks who had gangs to protect them.
Someone has to buy the kids nudie mags.
    I read this horribly wrong
        i read that horribly right
The type of criminal that Superheroes wouldn't even dare to look at.
    The type of criminal that never killed anyone
        Idk bout never theres no way kiryus ass whoopins aint givr someone brain damage
            Well he does shoot dead an army of guys.
                Those were rubber bullets and entropic explosions.
                    Ahh yes, my bad I forgot.
        Kiryu is batman??
        Not dead btw
        The guy at the end of Y6 who gets full force truck punched in the face so hard it CAVES IN is probably dead...
And i wouldnt change it for the world
My favorite sub story still is the one from kiwami 2 when he goes to an interview mockup and tells them about his experience in real estate and nobody believes him
>Kart racing with kids

So they get destroyed and lose all motivation to play

>Feed stray dogs

To prolong their miserable existence

>Give motivational speeches

So they foolishly try to achieve their dreams only to fail and get more depressed

Truly a force of evil
    You sound like a fun person.
        He needs a substory
            47 - The negative man
To be fair, it's not exactly like he's trying to be a criminal. While I haven't played past Yakuza Kiwami 2 yet (trying to get my hands on 3-6), that game did make it seem like Kiryu wants to leave the yakuza life behind and is only held back by his sense of duty.
Favorite Yakuza 3 moment:

*You gave the cat a catnip stick.*

10/10, would replay.
Just started Yakuza 0 and went into this series completely blind. I'm all in now, baby.
    Enjoy the ride kyoudai
Tf he talking about KIRYU STOLE THAT RC CAR CHAMPIONSHIP FROM THOSE SMALL CHILDREN
    IT'S NOT MY FAULT THEY DON'T HAVE SOME CLOWN DUDE THAT GIVES THEM CRAZY POCKET CAR PARTS
What's the context for the last "crime," speaking to that woman? Thanks!
    It's one of the cabaret girls getting a motivation speech during their coaching.
        Thanks for the reply! Do you remember which girl, by chance?
    I think she's a cabaret girl getting a motivation speech during her training.
        Idk why you were getting downvoted, that’s exactly what it looks like
        Thanks for the reply! Do you remember which cabaret girl, by chance?
His way of doing crimes is beating up bad guys!
Gamers before playing Yakuza vs after playing Yakuza.
He does have several brutal murders under his belt (If you wanna say he somehow hasn't killed anyone by triple-backflip-piledriving them headfirst into concrete, the car chases in 0, Kiwami, and Kiwami 2 all have *very* undeniable deaths at his hands.) but then again, he's never laid a finger on anyone unless it was self-defense or Haruka being a little shit.
    ***Kiryu has never killed a man in his life***
I mean these are exactly the kind of "crimes" I'm talking about when I say "be gay. Do crimes"
    Wut?!
“Yakuza”: upstanding community members who do everything from feeding stray animals to helping people set up a business to making a dominatrix master her dirty talking game.
I started with 0 going in blind a few months ago. I thought I was in for a crime intrigue story being almost a Japanese mob movie. To be fair 0 sort of is that but besides that. In a weird way I probably would think it was lame that Kiryu is this angelic being in a crime world if I knew before stsrting. There is something about Kiryu though that embodies it so well. I think at least for me it's in part because this man is denser than his fists and doesn't understand sometimes that he is unique.
Imagine Kiryu actually being evil.
    Basically, Ryuji.
"Fine, I'll let my fists do the talking."

Damn. What a bad-ass.

Feeding dogs and respecting women.
Yeah and walking around just basically saving and helping people.
He always does like one illegal thing in the beginning of each game then straight clears his karmic debt by the first chapter
Badass dad no.1
The most gangster thing to do is to be kind and help others
Kiryu in a nutshell:
Well to be fair, he's not a criminal on purpose. (except in Yakuza 0 where he is a member). Actually, he's better than the law most of the time.
An wise man once said: “Kiryu never killed anyone”
    Kiryu: Who told you that? *smashes a car window*
What could be more criminal than beating kids in toy car races and videos with sexy women dressed like insects.
If someone wants to rt the original tweet here's the link! https://twitter.com/Camperjon/status/905632458485276674?s=19
I think we forgetting all the times he went to collect money.
I just started playing about three years ago with Kiwami. I wish I had played this series years ago!
These are crimes in today’s world.
Poor kids. Just cause they don't have billions of real estate money to spend on toy cars. Get wrecked, poor kids.
    Or they dont have a clown on the strert corner that gives them millions of yen worth of *p l a t e s*
        That isn't so much though. I would love for kiryu to put his gold statue in the racer stadium

    Also Saejima is in jail for a hit he messed up big time
        Man, the last half of Yakuza 4 is so lame. The strange requirement RGG seems to have for all their protagonists to be moral paragons means they had to write some real stupid bullshit to "redeem" Saejima.
            It is probably the dumbest plot twist in the entire series because it makes no difference aside from having the one survivor. He still had the intention and performed the act so it doesnt change how we feel about him at all.
            When I first got to saejima's story in 4 I was psyched to actually play as a murderer. The colloseum scene was really tense as unlike Kiryu, you were led to believe that there was a very real chance saejima would kill the guy. What happened next was one of the best moments in the series.
    Ironically, the most criminal protagonist you play as is Tanimura, lol.
    Akiyama was never a loan shark
        Why are you replying to a 3 year-old comment.
    Ichiban gave up on being yakuza after founding out he did time for no reason
>!He literally gave money to the person he was supposed to shake down.!<
    Sorry, you gotta be more clear. You said you wanted his wallet.
        I honest to God died laughing at that part ngl
    Ichiban is just bad as his job.

Bering in the yakuza somehow makes him nicer given his backstory.

Also how are Assassin's apparently the best dad's in yakuza. We are 2 for 2 now
        Lao Gui would have been a bad ass dad if anybody was willing to touch him
            Maybe chinese market lao gui. Who looks a bit like shibusawa
                Yeah, Chinese market Lao Gui looks like a normal human being and not a demon.
                    Although I don't think that's so bad. Some times having a fucked up guy look fucked up is the point. Maybe it's just me. But being German i think it sucks that wolfenstein games still get censored here. Why would anybody be offended, it's just fiction and swastikas were part of the Nazi regime.

We learn that shit in school in atleast 3 different classes till you can't hear it anymore. But then they censor it in games.
                        I mean the Yakuza series, because of Japan's complicated history on race ethnic relations, does demonize foreigners a decent bit which I think can be problematic in some cases. With this issue, I'd say the real problem is that the character looks so much like an evil caricature that he doesn't really fit in.
                            Agreed on all points. Well explained
                            Yeah it was a nice change of pace that the Geomijul and Liumang just look like regular people. Instead of how Yakuza generally puts every Chinese character in a flowing jade robe and every Korean character is a J Pop idol. They’re trying to do better, at least?
        3, wasnt koichi from 6 also a mega assasin
            Didn't play it yet. Also dude my post is 5 months old.
Kiryu has a delusion about yakuza being this honourable organisation

Ichiban SEES DRAGONS
Also, Kiryu’s a virgin but just from one game, canonically, Ichiban FUCKS
    kiryu also canonically fucks
Like MAYBE Niko is probably the only GTA protagonist who isn't a complete shitstain but the gameplay still goes way against that.
    Even CJ, the friendly neighborhood gangster, had his psychotic moments.

Kiryu, at worst beat, the guy at the beginning of Yakuza 0 to an inch of his life. Heck, even while loan sharking, he seemed to only collect from crooks who had gangs to protect them.
I read this horribly wrong
    i read that horribly right
The type of criminal that never killed anyone
    Idk bout never theres no way kiryus ass whoopins aint givr someone brain damage
        Well he does shoot dead an army of guys.
            Those were rubber bullets and entropic explosions.
                Ahh yes, my bad I forgot.
    Kiryu is batman??
    Not dead btw
    The guy at the end of Y6 who gets full force truck punched in the face so hard it CAVES IN is probably dead...
You sound like a fun person.
    He needs a substory

Kiryu: Who told you that? *smashes a car window*
Or they dont have a clown on the strert corner that gives them millions of yen worth of *p l a t e s*
    That isn't so much though. I would love for kiryu to put his gold statue in the racer stadium
        Its enough for thr start, you get more before getting the chance to buy the best parts
            It's ok, i get it you are a fan of plates and/or clowns.

I actually have some cool plates from Japan at home. But i don't believe any pawn shop give me close.to.this much for it.

Also who wants to eat on a platinum dish. That shit is not healthy for you.
                The dog in kiwami 1


^(can someone test if you can use it)
                    I believe it's a paper plate. Also dog eating from a plate come on now. Give him a fork too ,😉
                        I know u need a paper plate, but thats the one that most ppl get cuz its easy

But *do other plates work*
                            The iron plate also works. I imagine that the rest probably do, too.
                            You have the dog 🐶 pic. If you don't know, we are doomed
                    You in fact can use one of the pawnable plates  had one in my inventory when that happened and they let me use it no problem.
        Which reminds me, why couldn't Ichiban build a damn gold statue of himself to continue the, ah, tradition
Don’t forget that Kiryu came back and did it again in a post-bubble economy too.
    I wrote that below
it is canon that kiryu blew all his real estate money buying godspeed motors for less than fortunate kids
That threw me for a loop, 100 mil for parts really, then just startin talking shit like "you ain't got that money bitch" to the little kids, while I'm on my 50th test drive for a course I can't beat. Love that mini game
Stop making me feel ashamed!
God forbid you go against his ideals though, because you WILL end up in a full body cast

Looks like you’re tonight’s big loser, the final boss in a yakuza game :)
    Now since Murr's tonight's big loser he's going to fight against Kazuma Kiryu the Dragon of Dojima.
I was gonna say, Ichiban literally fights crime as a vigilante haha
Not really. It's moreso Kiryu and Ichiban (and to a certain extent Majima, not so much Saejima who's just sort of 'naturally old-school') are basically people trying to emulate those romanticised ideals of being a protector for the weak that works outside the law, which in some way are basically the 'old noble ways' in the games that basically stopped being part of either clan when Jin Goda died and was on its way out as far back as 0. It's why 6 has such a big thing of the new type of Yakuza coming in, why 7 shows what the old guard does when its time is up, etc. Most other Yakuza in the games are more close to real-world Yakuza, pragmatic and efficient exploiters of the poor and the guillible, with a tinge of loyalty and honour and brotherhood still running throughout to make them LESS reprehensible (or more in some cases). Like, a LOT of the tropes of the Yakuza basically are pushed by real-world Yakuza to try and make them seem more 'friendly' and necessary than they really are. Even the games tend to acknowledge this, as the only good the Yakuza do for citizens seems to be keeping rampant gangs from going about, which is about the only real positive side to their existence in the real world, and even then they just tend to have a more organised system of fucking with citizens.
    “Basically.”
I’m crying laughing
"Ichiban please don't eat floor food."
I mean Akiyama is in a legal grey zone but he has enough that he does not care for profit, it's very intentional with his values.

Ichiban's only Yakuza trait is being knowledgeable about the workings of a gang structure but it's something.
    His whole thing is "If I trust you enough to give you money, I can trust you enough to pay back your debt in your own time."
    G-Grey zone? 

Better hope Akiyama doesnt try and start Sky Finance in Ijincho
Majima is actually Yakuza tho he rejoined Tojo after 2. We don’t really know what he does with his time and I think it’s safe to assume he does actual “Yakuza” things on top of Majima construction since everyone is scared of him. You don’t get his kind of reputation by being a softy like kiryu.

The way I see it they intentionally left majimas criminal side more vague because they hate showing the main characters do serious crimes for some reason. Remember Majima was literally gonna kill that one guy at the start of 1 if kiryu didn’t stop him, so imagine what he does when kiryus not around. He’s probably a REALLY BAD GUY but the writers make him likable by only showing him being goofy.
    Yeah, the thing with the Yakuza series is that beside the playable characters in 1-6, even the Yakuza members we're meant to root for are at the very least complicit in some really horrible stuff. You look at how Sohei Dojima was so seemingly respected by his underlings in Yakuza 2 despite being one of the most evil characters in the series and those guys are supposed to be the Yakuza that are on your side in that game. 

I think the "good" Yakuza in the series at their very best are just guys that have a strong sense of loyalty and honor but in the grand scheme of things are still really reprehensible criminals. I suspects that's partly the reason why we didn't get to play as Majima until much later in the series, I don't think the devs wanted us to emphatize with a character that is so violent and seemingly unstable despite his popularity. When we finally did get to play as him, we played a very different version to the one we already knew.
        > I think the "good" Yakuza in the series at their very best are just guys that have a strong sense of loyalty and honor but in the grand scheme of things are still really reprehensible criminals. 

That reminds me of  how 0 feels like it thought Awano was redeemed in the end for sacrificing himself for Majima and the honor of their fight, even though the rest of his life he enjoyed randomly murdering women, blackmailing people, and just beating in people's faces.
        I think Majima was intended to be the opposite of kiryu who never wants to actually do Yakuza stuff. Majima “crossed the line” that they kept talking about in Yakuza 0 but kiryu did not. 

Majima said in 0 you get to choose who you bring down with you, he knew which path he wanted to go down so he ditched makoto as to not drag her down to his level.

Nishiki was the same as Majima, he “crossed the line” when he killed that one guy and became worse and worse of a person after he did that even though he said in 0 if either kiryu or him crossed the line they would do it together.
        This! When I first used Daigo’s Poundmate summon in Like A Dragon I was like yo WTF is the first Chairman doing here, that dude is a rapist and his ghost should be in hell
            Do you mean Dojima? We never get to meet the first Tojo chairman at all, and we only get to see the second's stand-in in 0. Dojima was trying to become the third chairman but >! Was beaten by Sera !<
    He does kind of mention some of his other business when he's dressed as Goromi. At the very least, we know he handles imports, including "some good Jamaican shit".

It's ok, i get it you are a fan of plates and/or clowns.

I actually have some cool plates from Japan at home. But i don't believe any pawn shop give me close.to.this much for it.

Also who wants to eat on a platinum dish. That shit is not healthy for you.

        I believe it's a paper plate. Also dog eating from a plate come on now. Give him a fork too ,😉
            I know u need a paper plate, but thats the one that most ppl get cuz its easy

But *do other plates work*
                The iron plate also works. I imagine that the rest probably do, too.
                You have the dog 🐶 pic. If you don't know, we are doomed
        You in fact can use one of the pawnable plates  had one in my inventory when that happened and they let me use it no problem.
Do you mean Dojima? We never get to meet the first Tojo chairman at all, and we only get to see the second's stand-in in 0. Dojima was trying to become the third chairman but >! Was beaten by Sera !<
Yeah, Chinese market Lao Gui looks like a normal human being and not a demon.
    Although I don't think that's so bad. Some times having a fucked up guy look fucked up is the point. Maybe it's just me. But being German i think it sucks that wolfenstein games still get censored here. Why would anybody be offended, it's just fiction and swastikas were part of the Nazi regime.

We learn that shit in school in atleast 3 different classes till you can't hear it anymore. But then they censor it in games.
        I mean the Yakuza series, because of Japan's complicated history on race ethnic relations, does demonize foreigners a decent bit which I think can be problematic in some cases. With this issue, I'd say the real problem is that the character looks so much like an evil caricature that he doesn't really fit in.
            Agreed on all points. Well explained
            Yeah it was a nice change of pace that the Geomijul and Liumang just look like regular people. Instead of how Yakuza generally puts every Chinese character in a flowing jade robe and every Korean character is a J Pop idol. They’re trying to do better, at least?
Ahh yes, my bad I forgot.
